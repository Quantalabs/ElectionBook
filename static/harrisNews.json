Under Florida's judicial rules, such outreach is allowed as long as it is limited, indirect, and kept strictly outside the courtroom.\n\n'This is Judge Stefanie Moon. I hope you are well. I'm reaching out because I'm putting together my reelection committee and I was wondering if you would agree to serve. If you would kindly return my call, I'd greatly appreciate it,' Judge Moon said in her voicemail to Jones.\n\nBut after dismissing a restraining order case in which Jones was representing a client, Judge Moon, still in her robe, seated in her courtroom, turned directly to the lawyer. \n\n'I left you a message,' she told attorney Jones, shortly after dismissing a case in which he had been representing one of the parties. \n\nJust before the courtroom audio was deactivated she asked him about his silence. \n\n'I said, 'Yes, judge. You did.' And she asked me why I didn't return the court's call,' Jones recalled. 'I was extremely uncomfortable.' \n\nThe JQC said it was 'quite disturbed' by Moon's in-court remarks to Jones describing it as 'an inappropriate political activity' citing the power imbalance created when a judge questions an attorney in open court about campaign support. \n\n'The inherently coercive nature of the interaction… could reasonably raise questions about the judge's integrity or impartiality,' the commission concluded.\n\nMoon later admitted that the exchange was inappropriate and could have been perceived as coercive - but she disputed the allegation that she asked Jones why he hadn't returned her call, saying it was 'self-evident.'\n\nBut it appears Moon's missteps didn't end there. \n\nOn Friday, the JQC released documents detailing additional violations, including her donations to political committees supporting Kamala Harris, President Joe Biden, and ActBlue.\n\nFlorida's judicial ethics rules bar sitting judges from contributing to political campaigns or partisan organizations.\n\nThe JQC said the fine and public reprimand were appropriate given Moon's admission of wrongdoing, her expression of 'deep regret', and her cooperation with investigators. \n\nThe cumulative effect of her actions has prompted rare scrutiny for a judge once seen as a rising star in Broward legal circles.\n\nMoon, who was elected to the Broward County circuit bench in 2018 following stints as an assistant US attorney and private civil litigator, has declined to comment publicly despite repeated requests from NBC6, which first exposed the election-related controversy last year.\n\nMoon, who has served in family court since her election in 2018, also admitted to another violation: improperly contacting a mental health counselor who was scheduled to testify in a stalking case before her.\n\nShe phoned the witness outside the presence of attorneys and parties and began questioning him before he could testify in court, a clear violation of judicial protocol.\n\nThe JQC noted the action undermined procedural fairness and risked contaminating the integrity of the proceedings. \n\nThe commission described the conduct as serious but stopped short of recommending suspension or removal, citing her acknowledgment of misconduct and willingness to accept sanctions.\n\nConcerns about her conduct have come from multiple corners of the legal community.\n\nJohnny Weekes, her 2024 primary opponent, accused Moon of displaying a lack of respect and professionalism in her courtroom and said he ran against her to offer voters a different option.\n\nWeekes believed 'the candor, the respect that's in that courtroom just is not there. And I thought Broward County needed something different,' he explained. \n\nHe pointed to several troubling incidents, including her decision not to reschedule a Monday morning hearing to accommodate his travel with his teenage son - a hearing that Moon herself allegedly missed due to her own travel delays.\n\n'She wanted me in that courtroom, and I was there,' Weekes told NBC6. 'And she wasn't.'\n\nJones, meanwhile, has vowed to ask Moon to recuse herself from any future cases he argues before her.\n\n'Not returning a judge's call who directly looks for your help puts me in a bad situation,' he said. 'I felt intimidated.'\n\nThough Moon has consented to the reprimand and fine, the final word now lies with the Florida Supreme Court, which can accept, reject, or modify the JQC's recommendation. \n\nIf it agrees, Moon would be publicly reprimanded - a formal mark of censure - but could remain on the bench.\n\nMoon's supporters say she is meticulous and fair, and that the violations should be viewed as lapses in judgment, not patterns of misconduct. \n\n'Judge Moon is one of the most ethical, methodical, thorough judges I've ever appeared in front of. Everything in her courtroom is by the book,' said attorney Valerie Small-Williams, who served on Moon's reelection committee. 'I don't think her intent was to violate anything.' \n\nWhile some might see a troubling trend that undermines the very foundation of the judiciary, last August voters returned Moon to the bench with nearly 65 percent of the vote.","summary":"The state's judicial watchdog says Stefanie Moon crossed ethical lines by confronting an attorney in court about a campaign call and donating to Democratic causes while on the bench.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14581595/Glamorous-Florida-judge-big-trouble-rogue-courtroom-behavior.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/08/01/97022289-0-image-m-12_1744071887404.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-08 00:50:21","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":308751754,"title":"Trump plans to have annual physical exam later this week: 'Never felt better'","text":"President Donald Trump announced on Monday that he plans to undergo a physical examination on Friday, marking his first annual physical in his second administration.

Trump was treated for COVID-19 at the same hospital in 2020. \"I am pleased to report that my long scheduled Annual Physical Examination will be done at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Friday of this week,\" the Republican wrote. \"I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!\" Trump's stamina and physical health have been a center of attention since his July 13 assassination attempt, which he miraculously survived.

Months later, in November, Florida neurosurgeon Dr. Brett Osborn told Fox News Digital that Trump remained in good health. \"The fact that he attended 120 events in seven months, often multiple rallies in a single day in different states, is proof-positive that Trump has a tremendous amount of stamina, mentally and physically,\" Osborn noted.

Or why she seems to be enduring one of the strangest female midlife crises in recent memory, taking to the airwaves with her hair in pom-poms atop her head?\n\nThis is the 61-year-old former First Lady of the United States acting, looking and sounding, frankly, like a teenager.\n\nWhen asked on her latest, irrelevant podcast episode if women are smart to marry men who aren’t financially stable, she said: ‘Uh, I married one.’\n\nWow.

Smith Running For President Is More Real Than It Sounds | Bobby Burack","text":"Stephen A. Smith says he is no longer dismissing the possibility of running for president in 2028. On Monday, Smith posted on X that he is officially \"leaving all doors open\" based on the state of the country. \"Time to stop messing around. Life is great. Especially at ESPN/Disney. Hate the thought of being a politician. But sick of this mess,\" he said. Smith previously stated he could win the Democratic primary but had no intentions of running. Granted, that was when he was still negotiating his five-year, $100 contract with ESPN. Look, Stephen A. has no business running for president. He's not informed and his political beliefs are shallow and inconsistent. A year ago, he didn't understand the concept of \"equity\" in reference to DEI. Smith revealed during a podcast appearance with Will Cain that he thought equity was a synonym for equality. By definition, equity is the antithesis of equality. However, that doesn't mean he won't run for president. And that doesn't mean he wouldn't have a chance, backed and propped up by his employer, Disney and CEO Bob Iger. In February, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries tried to legitimize Smith's potential candidacy by telling reporters, \"There is a lot to like about Stephen A. Smith [as a candidate].\" We explained at the time that Jeffries understood the opportunity. There is nothing more valuable to party leaders than a puppet candidate with the charisma to spread the message effectively. That's Stephen A. Smith: a talented communicator willing to adopt whatever beliefs his enablers order. Last year, Smith tried to dispel the notion that he is liberal in an interview with Sean Hannity. During the interview, Smith referenced a study that found more and more black men relating to Donald Trump. Smith said he understood why. He then apologized two days later after Black Twitter accused him of \"selling out.\" \"I’m fully aware that I have been in the news the last few days, paraded all over social media as well after comments I made on Fox News’ Hannity last week…A lot of folks in black America seem pretty pissed at me right now,\" Smith said on X. \"Quite a few folks were offended as my words were interpreted as associating support for Trump by the black community with all the legal issues he’s facing. For that, I sincerely apologize. I’m stating right here for the record that I was taken out of context. Just because my intent was harmless, doesn’t mean my words were harmless, and I know that.\" Smith claims he was taken out of context by accurately citing the results of a poll. Got it. For a field study, listen to what Smith says on the \"Mark Levin Show\" and compare it to what he says on \"The View.\" It's two different people. But that's the point. That's what makes him potentially useful to the Democrat Party. He is willing to be whoever the party needs him to be. The party could package Smith as a solution to its disconnect with young males (his background in sports) and a political outsider (the counter to Donald Trump). He could also try to resell identity politics as a solution to the wealth gap (it’s not). The market agrees he has a chance. According to Kalshi, Smith has a 6% chance of winning the Democratic primary in 2028. His odds are even with Kamala Harris and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. California governor Gavin Newsom has the best odds, at 17%. The challenge for Smith, however, is that he would have to debate the other candidates on stage. While Newsom and Pete Buttigieg are hardly the greatest minds of this generation, they aren't Max Kellerman either. Smith won't be able to bully them and threaten to quit when they make a fool of him. Smith would also have to answer for his past. What is his past, you might ask? That's the point. We don't know. Last year, Jason Whitlock reported on a series of inconsistencies and fabrications in Smith's memoir, \"Straight Shooter.\" Smith responded by calling Whitlock a \"fat bastard,\" a \"fat piece of shit,\" and the \"seed of the devil\". By all accounts, Smith created a fake history about himself and wrote a book around it. So, where does that leave his chances? It depends on how much the chieftains of the Democratic Party want him to be the candidate. For three straight elections, the party has taken the vote out of the hands of voters. The party conspired to knock out Bernie Sanders twice. Last summer, the party installed Kamala Harris when it realized its plan to conceal Joe Biden's cognitive demise failed after he humiliated himself on the debate stage against Trump. You'd think the party would prefer someone a bit more formidable against potentially JD Vance than a former 76ers beat reporter who defaults to the race card when in a pinch. But in a party with AOC, Jasmine Crockett and Tim Walz – perhaps Stephen A. is the most useful option.","summary":"Stephen A.

The Times report, which cited anonymous sources, did not identify the mediator.\n\nThe Texas federal court hearing the case said in a Feb. 20 scheduling order that “Any mediation must be completed by Saturday, December 20, 2025.”\n\nTrump sued CBS News a few days before the November 2024 presidential election, alleging that the “’60 Minutes” violated a Texas consumer protection law by deceptively editing an interview with VP Kamala Harris. Earlier this year, the president expanded the lawsuit, alleging an additional claim under the federal Lanham Act and seeking $20 billion in damages.\n\nLast month, Paramount moved to dismiss Trump’s suit as “an affront to the First Amendment.” The company filed two motions to dismiss the case, one for lack of jurisdiction and the other on grounds that consumer fraud laws do not govern editorial speech.\n\nParamount is seeking to merge with Skydance Media, a deal that is still pending approval by the FCC. The agency’s chairman, Trump-appointed commissioner Brendan Carr, has said the FCC would consider the “60 Minutes” case in its review of the merger.\n\nSeparately, in March CBS asked the FCC to reject a complaint by a right-wing public interest law firm alleging the “60 Minutes” interview with Harris represented “news distortion,” arguing that the complaint is premised on the notion that the U.S. government can be a “roving censor.” CBS, in its March 7 response to the FCC over the Center for American Rights complaint, said that “The Complaint filed against CBS for ‘news distortion’ envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor — one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming.”\n\nCarr, as part of an FCC probe into potential “news distortion” into CBS News, demanded that news outlet turn over all materials tied to the “60 Minutes” Harris segment including transcripts and unedited video. In February, CBS News did so, maintaining that the “60 Minutes” broadcast “was not doctored or deceitful.”\n\nMeanwhile, in a separate case, Trump last year sued ABC News and George Stephanopoulos after the anchor inaccurately stated on-air that Trump had been found liable for rape. (Trump was found liable of sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll by a New York jury.) In December 2024, Disney and ABC News agreed to pay $15 million to settle Trump’s defamation lawsuit.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLawyers for Paramount Global and President Donald Trump have agreed on a&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Paramount and Trump Reach Agreement on Mediator for $20 Billion &#8217;60 Minutes&#8217; Lawsuit, According to Report first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/entertainment/paramount-and-trump-reach-agreement-on-mediator-for-20-billion-60-minutes-lawsuit-according-to-report/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 22:02:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":308735280,"title":"Paramount-Skydance Merger Deadline Extended 90 Days as FCC Approval Remains in Limbo","text":"The closing deadline for Paramount Global and Skydance Media’s pending $8 billion merger has been automatically extended to July 6 as the Federal Communications Commission’s regulatory review of a required transfer of broadcast licenses remains ongoing.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement outlined in an S4 prospectus filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the deal was initially expected to close by Monday. However, it is subject to two automatic 90-day extensions, which are triggered when “all of the conditions of the closing, except those relating to regulatory approvals, have been satisfied or waived.”\n\nIf the deal is not closed by July 6, the deadline will be automatically pushed another 90 days to Oct. 4. After that, if the deal is still not closed, or if a regulator blocks the merger or one of the parties involved breaches the terms of the agreement, then Skydance and Paramount will have the option of terminating the deal. Exercising that option would leave Paramount on the hook to pay Skydance a $400 million breakup fee. \n\nThe deal has already received approval from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission as well as the European Commission. The FCC typically aims to review license transfer applications within 180 days, though the timeline is informal and can be paused if necessary. The deal is currently on day 143, per the FCC’s tracker on its website.\n\nThe transaction’s delayed closing comes as several parties have challenged the deal in petitions filed with the FCC. \n\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr has previously said a “news distortion” complaint from The Center for American Rights against CBS’ “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris would “likely arise” in his review of the Skydance transaction. \n\nThe agency has since held meetings with the conservative-leaning “public interest” law firm, as well as Hollywood’s Teamsters union and Project Rise Partners, which has made an alternative $13.5 billion offer for Paramount, to discuss their concerns with the Skydance deal. \n\nSeparately, the FCC has launched its own investigation into the interview, which has become the subject of a $20 billion lawsuit from President Donald Trump. Paramount and CBS have since moved to dismiss the suit, calling it “an affront to the First Amendment.” \n\nThe company is also in talks with Trump about a potential settlement, with the two parties reportedly agreeing to a mediator. Any mediation in the litigation must be completed by Dec. 20, per the Texas federal court hearing the case.\n\nCarr also threatened to block mergers and acquisitions by any company who embraces diversity, equity and inclusion policies, which Paramount has since rolled back in order to comply with an executive order from the Trump administration. \n\nAdditionally, Paramount shareholders including Mario Gabelli and the Employees Retirement System of Rhode Island have gone to the Delaware Court of Chancery to request documents related to the deal as they investigate whether it prioritizes Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone at the expense of the media giant’s other investors. \n\nSome class B shareholders have also sent demand letters related to alleged omissions in New Paramount’s registration statement.\n\nThe deal also faces one class-action lawsuit from a group of New York City pension funds, who allege the Paramount board breached its fiduciary duty by not considering Project Rise Partners’ bid, and a proposed class-action lawsuit from Paramount shareholder Scott Baker, who argues the Skydance deal could cost shareholders $1.65 billion in damages.","summary":"The $8 billion deal was initially expected to close Monday\n\n\nThe post Paramount-Skydance Merger Deadline Extended 90 Days as FCC Approval Remains in Limbo appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-skydance-merger-closing-deadline-extended/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/061024-paramount-image-V3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 21:53:52","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":308729724,"title":"Musk Hits Back at Tim Walz’s Criticism of Tesla with a Fierce Response","text":"Elon Musk slammed Tim Walz with a savage insult after the failed Democratic VP candidate mocked Tesla’s tumbling stock value. \n\nThe Tesla chief was branded an ‘un-elected, South African nepo-baby’ by Walz this week at a town hall in Wisconsin titled ‘The People vs Musk’, where Walz took aim at the electric car maker’s 41.4 percent stock fall as of March. \n\n‘On the iPhone, they’ve got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day,’ Walz said at the event. \n\nIn response, Musk ridiculed Walz over his heavy election defeat in November alongside Kamala Harris, saying he gets the same ‘boost’ when he remembers their drubbing. \n\n‘Sometimes when I need a little boost, I look at the @JDVance portrait in the White House and thank the Lord,’ Musk wrote on X. \n\nThe White House’s ‘Rapid Response’ account piled on, adding in its own post alongside Vance and President Trump’s official portraits: ‘When we need a little boost during the day at the White House, we walk around the corner from our office and admire these beautiful portraits.’ \n\nIt comes as Walz has faced backlash from conservatives for his remarks at the town hall, with some accusing him of celebrating the downfall of a key American-based company. \n\nThe GOP House Judiciary said the Minnesota Governor exhibited ‘disgusting behavior’, while Texas Senator Ted Cruz branded him a ‘small, petty, vindictive, evil b***ard’ who ‘represents today’s Democrats well.’ \n\nWalz’s remarks on Tesla’s struggles come as some customers revolt against his intimate ties to the Trump White House, with liberal groups calling for a boycott of the electric car manufacturer. \n\nTesla vehicles and facilities across America have also been targeted by vandalism and attacks in recent weeks, including in Las Vegas this week where several of the vehicles were firebombed. \n\nThe FBI launched an investigation into the attack, and Attorney General Pam Bondi branded the incident ‘nothing short of domestic terrorism.’ \n\nWalz’s speech aimed at Musk comes as the former VP candidate has been on a media blitz in recent weeks, fueling speculation that he is considering a run for president in 2028. \n\nWhen pressed by the New Yorker earlier this month, the 60-year-old did not rule out a run for the White House. \n\n‘Look I never had an ambition to be President or Vice President. I was honored to be asked,’ he said. \n\n‘If I feel like I can serve, I will. And if nationally, people are like, “Dude we tried you and look how that worked out,” I’m good with that.’\n\nWhen the politician was then asked point-blank whether he would ever run for president, he replied: ‘Well I had a friend tell me, “Never turn down a job you haven’t been offered.”\n\n‘If I think I could offer something… I would certainly consider that. I’m also, though, not arrogant enough to believe there’s a lot of people that can do this.’\n\nHe then explained that if the circumstances are right in 2028 and he has the right ‘skill set’ for the moment, ‘I’ll do it.’\n\n‘I’ll do whatever it takes. I certainly wouldn’t be arrogant enough to think that it needs to be me. \n\nWhile Walz weighs a run for president, he faces the prospect of the world’s richest man dampening his hopes. \n\nMusk’s insult hurled at Walz this week was far from his first, with the Tesla chief mocking Walz’s November defeat last month as well. \n\nWalz said in an X post that ‘the richest man in the world is sitting at the Resolute Desk, about to defund your public school. Trump should stop him.’ \n\nMusk responded: ‘What’s your name again? I forgot.’ \n\nIn another exchange days earlier, Musk mocked Walz’s moves as Governor in Minnesota to allow tampons to be placed in boy’s bathrooms in schools. \n\nAfter Walz said that Musk was ‘a terrible president’, Musk responded with a meme of an elderly character from the movie Up ridiculing Walz.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nElon Musk slammed Tim Walz with a savage insult after the failed Democratic&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Musk Hits Back at Tim Walz&#8217;s Criticism of Tesla with a Fierce Response first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/musk-hits-back-at-tim-walzs-criticism-of-tesla-with-a-fierce-response/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/20/14/96396171-14519465-image-a-6_1742481630785.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 21:49:51","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":308732926,"title":"Why are there so many boomers at anti-Trump protests?","text":"I was looking through photos from the anti-Trump and anti-DOGE protests across the US over the weekend, and I couldn't help but notice something: There sure was a lot of gray hair.That struck me as different from what I remember about recent protests of the past — like Black Lives Matter and Israel/Gaza protests, where younger people seemed to be leading the charge.I'm apparently not the only person who's noticed. On r/50501, one of the Reddit forums for organizing the weekend's protests, someone posted, \"We really got to hand it to the boomers.\"\"I saw three pretty large protests today around where I lived,\" the person said. \"Guess who showed up and gave the biggest display of support? Boomers.\"My colleague Lakshmi Varanasi flagged something similar recently, too. She reported on two \"Tesla takedown\" protests last month in Michigan:Business Insider reporters who checked out this past weekend's protests from locations around the country also noticed a similar trend: \"Many said they were most worried about the economy and their retirement investments, which have dwindled in tandem with Trump's tariff announcements.\"Anecdotally, I've noticed something to this effect in the suburbs of New York City where I live — the small smatterings of protests in town squares over the last month or two seem to be largely made of women over 60. (This may have to do with the overall age demographics of the suburbs, so I didn't read too much into it.)Still, I have a few theories as to why so many boomers are showing up to protest.The first is that baby boomers (who are generally 61 to 79 years old) are either at or near retirement age. They're the most concerned with the fate of Social Security and their retirement portfolios. Those two things have been thrown into chaos. Elon Musk has referred to Social Security as \"the biggest Ponzi scheme,\" although he's also said valid recipients could get more benefits once he's done rooting out waste.And the new tariffs have sent the stock market into a nosedive over the last week, which could hurt the retirement accounts of people who are actually retired. If prices on all kinds of stuff rise, that also hurts retirees on a fixed income. Keep in mind, lots of boomers love Temu.But let's be honest: A 65-year-old Trump voter who looked at their investment account in dismay on Friday wasn't going to decide to show up to the anti-Trump protests on Saturday. Baby boomers, like any generation, aren't a monolith. (Boomers voted equally for Kamala Harris and Donald Trump in the 2024 election.) And the people who attend a protest have probably held the same political orientation for decades. This isn't a case where the last few weeks have radicalized and changed the minds of all boomers.Yet I do think it's possible that recent events activated some sleeper cells — older Democrats who had stayed home for the student Gaza demonstrations or the 2020 Black Lives Matter marches.I asked Robert Cohen, professor of history and social studies at NYU whose work focuses on the history of protest movements, for his take on all of this. He warned against making any sweeping generalizations.Cohen acknowledged that baby boomers who had lived through — or participated in — the protest movements of the '60s and '70s may, in fact, have a slightly different perspective and rationale for the anti-Trump protests today.\"What does 'Make America Great Again' mean? It means America minus the social changes of the '60s,\" Cohen said.Consider some of the things boomers take pride in their generation pushing for: civil rights, women's rights, environmental causes — they may feel an urgency to come to the rescue of those things being under threat.A generation that attended concerts for Live Aid, the Concert for Bangladesh, and made a Christmas song with the lyrics \"Do they know it's Christmastime at all?\" might have a different perspective about the implications of pulling USAID out of developing nations where part of its work was addressing global hunger.Neil Young at a \"Hands Off!\" pic.twitter.com/FZyNRmSQtOPeople over 65 are the most reliable voting bloc, and that may be meaningful here.\"It's really harder for [politicians] to dismiss them both because they vote more, but also because they've been around, and it's not like some kind of a youthful exuberance,\" Cohen said.I should once again give a disclaimer that any sweeping generalization about generations is always going to come up short. (Trump himself is a boomer, after all.) And all of my evidence about the age demographic of demonstrators this weekend is purely anecdotal.But if our image of a protester from the last few years was of a young person with blue hair, perhaps we need to update to a retiree in capri pants and a \"world's best grandma\" shirt.","summary":"Baby boomers seemed surprisingly involved in recent anti-Trump demonstrations.

The Trump administration has initiated extensive purges within the federal government since the beginning of his new term. \n\nThe newly established Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, has overseen massive terminations across vital agencies, including the Department of Education, Health and Human Services, and USAID. All of these efforts are designed to dismantle regulations that threaten the legacy established by Biden and Obama.\n\nFurthermore, he has stripped legal clearance from various law firms, rolled back diversity policies, attempted to end birthright citizenship, and is enforcing harsh immigration measures, creating societal divisions and prompting legal challenges.\n\nIndividuals in his sights include Dr. Anthony Fauci of COVID-19 fame, New York Attorney General Letitia James, who oversees some of Trump’s legal woes and — of course — Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris. But that list is far is from exhaustive. \n\nTrump’s vengeance has made a mark in domestic and international arenas, with significant implications for the U.S. political and economic landscape. It’s all about power and retribution: Following his humiliating loss in the 2020 election, he has faced multiple investigations, indictments, and public ridicule, which have fueled his desire to retaliate against those who wronged him. \n\nThis includes former government officials, media figures, prosecutors, and political rivals. This presidential term is marked to be different. He has tested his powers by installing loyalists in key positions while undermining the judiciary and federal agencies, strategically aligning the government to “kiss the ring.”\n\nThese actions have ignited nationwide protests and a massive backlash surrounding the gutting of essential public services. Though these acts are aggressive, they are largely performative. He is appeasing his supporters, constructing a narrative that his actions represent not vindication but justice. Thus, these firings are nothing but a flex of his power.\n\nWithin these 77 days, he has set the tone: Cross Trump, he will bury you.

Walz blamed Biden himself — “He made the decision” — and then added, “I would hope we would never do it again.” Then, he changed the subject. \n\nOne eye-opening part of the interview was when Walz was asked about the Harris-Walz ticket’s position on immigration and the disaster at the U.S.-Mexico border. His answer suggested that if Democrats had won the election last November, the problem at the border created by Biden would have continued under President Kamala Harris.\n\n“On immigration,” Walz said, “what we were asking for is a bipartisan policy that strengthens immigration control, that recognizes that we need a workforce here, that they should be allowed here legally, and that, when they get here, they’re part of the American fabric.”\n\nFrom that, it appears that Walz’s border policy was to legalize the migrants who were crossing illegally during the Biden years, get them jobs, and then make sure that they are “part of the American fabric.” At another point in the interview, Walz said, “None of us are saying we should be soft on the border.” But that sounds pretty soft on the border.\n\nWalz continued: “I’m not going to say what we need to do is, we need to just arrest people and ship them to El Salvador. No, what we need to do, invest the money on the border. We need to make sure that we have the judges necessary to adjudicate things faster. We need to make sure, if you’re going to be in this country here legally, when you are, you’re going to be uplifted, celebrated, and part of this great American tapestry. And that is the bipartisan bill we had.”\n\nThat last part was a reference to legislation that Harris often claimed would fix the problems of thousands and thousands of migrants crossing the border every day and being allowed to stay in the United States. The bill, Harris said in many campaign appearances, would be the heart of her border and immigration policy. It never passed House or Senate votes, nor would it today if Walz and Harris were in the White House.\n\nBut what Walz’s interview really brings to mind is the fact that if he and Harris had been elected, the border problem would still be with us. One of the remarkable things about the second Trump administration is how quickly Trump stopped the massive and destructive flow of illegal crossers over the border. The border crisis, once named in opinion polls as one of the nation’s most pressing issues, virtually disappeared overnight.\n\n“Since taking office, my administration has launched the most sweeping border and immigration crackdown in American history, and we quickly achieved the lowest numbers of illegal border crossers ever recorded,” Trump said in his March address to a joint session of Congress. “The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation: ‘We must have legislation to secure the border.’ But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president.”\n\nHe was right. Trump has, of course, since moved on to other issues and controversies. But with his discussion of the border, Walz gave us a deeply troubling glimpse of what might have been.","summary":"TIM WALZ AND THE BORDER CRISIS THAT WOULD STILL BE A CRISIS. You might not have noticed, but Gov.

The book, \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" published Tuesday by William Morrow and Company, claims that Harris’ White House communications director Jamal Simmons crafted an entire communications strategy to employ in the event of Biden’s death. The book, authored by political journalists Jonathan Allen of NBC News and Amie Parnes of the Hill, said Simmons imagined that losing Biden unexpectedly would be akin to when Lyndon B. Johnson was sworn in on Air Force One following John F. Kennedy’s assassination in 1963. But he worried people would question her legitimacy as president, and was specifically concerned that \"Trump people\" would go \"apes---\" if Harris became president, the book claims. TENSIONS ALLEGEDLY RISE BETWEEN BIDEN WHITE HOUSE AND HARRIS CAMPAIGN: 'TOO MUCH IN THEIR FEELINGS' \"Simmons believed Harris would be strengthened by an institutional stamp of approval if she were sworn in hurriedly because Biden had died unexpectedly,\" Allen and Parnes wrote. \"Her legitimacy might be questioned, he worried, recalling the January 6 effort to stop Biden from being certified as president.\" As a result, Simmons created a spreadsheet of various judges nominated by a Republican who might be equipped to help bolster her legitimacy. \"The strongest validator, he believed, would be a federal judge who had been appointed by a Republican other than Trump,\" Allen and Parnes wrote. \"He compiled a spreadsheet of those jurists across the country, down to a city-by-city breakdown, and carried it with him when he traveled with Harris.\" Simmons said he never told Harris about the so-called \"death-pool roster\" before his departure with her communications team in January 2023, however he instructed colleagues to notify him immediately if something did happen to Biden so he could implement the communications strategy. Ultimately, Simmons left the spreadsheet with another Harris staffer, according to the book. The book did not specify which judges were included on the list. Harris, who previously served as a senator from California, is now a speaker with CAA Speakers, which represents high-profile celebrities.

I'm furious. | Opinion - USA Today","text":"For months in early 2024, conservatives like myself tried to sound the alarm on President Joe Biden's declining physical and mental health. It was obvious that he was unwell.\n\nYet, Democrats and much of the legacy news media ignored that reality and even attacked those of us who were willing to speak the truth. They claimed we were fabricating tales and spreading baseless conspiracy theories.\n\nNow, the narrative has changed dramatically. Journalists are publishing books and news articles detailing not only Biden's poor health but also an orchestrated cover-up inside the White House. According to one of the books, even one of Biden's closest former aides now admits that the commander in chief was \"out of it\" last year as he attempted to run for reelection.\n\nThis is one of the biggest scandals of my adult life. Now we know that Biden's inner circle deliberately misled the American people in an election year about the incumbent president's ability to serve a second term.\n\nWe also know that journalists were far too passive, at best, in reporting revelations that Americans needed to know before the election.\n\n'Biden might die in office'\n\nPolitico reported last week that at least four books will be published in the next few weeks that provide new details about Biden's failing health and the conspiracy to cover it up.\n\nOne of those books, \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” by NBC News' Jonathan Allen and The Hill's Amie Parnes, includes incredible details about Biden's poor health while he was still in office.\n\nThe authors report that Democratic leaders were worried that Biden could not win another election and had “hush-hush talks” discussing his potential withdrawal from the race as early as 2023.\n\nBiden did withdraw, but not until July 2024, after his disastrous debate against Donald Trump.\n\nThe most damning part of \"Fight\" is the revelation that Vice President Kamala Harris' aides were so concerned about the president's health that they \"strategized around the possibility that Biden might die in office.\" The authors report that Jamal Simmons, the vice president's communications director, drew up a “death-pool roster” of federal judges who could swear in Harris as president if Biden died.\n\nBiden aides 'believed what they wanted to believe'\n\nIn “Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History,\" author Chris Whipple details Biden's serious mental and physical decline.\n\n“I have fresh reporting on an hour-by-hour, day-by-day basis of Biden’s final days, and obviously his decline is a major part of the story,\" Whipple told Politico.\n\nAfter extensive reporting, Whipple, a former \"60 Minutes\" producer, came to the conclusion that Democrats were in deep denial about Biden's condition: “I happen to think that to call it a ‘cover-up’ is simplistic. I think it was stranger and way more troubling than that. Biden’s inner circle, his closest advisers, many of them were in a fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe.”\n\nRon Klain, a longtime aide to Biden and his former White House chief of staff, helped the president prepare for his fateful debate with Trump last year. Klain told Whipple that Biden “didn’t know what Trump had been saying and couldn’t grasp what the back and forth was.”\n\nKlain also described how Biden “didn’t really understand what his argument was on inflation” and “had nothing to say about a second term other than finish the job.”\n\nAmericans deserved better\n\nBiden didn't just run for reelection, quit and pass the torch to Harris. He was the sitting president, who was in serious decline and was surrounded by people who knew it but stayed silent.\n\nA Washington Post review of \"Fight\" notes, \"So much fresh material, so many bruised egos, so many scores to settle. ... Every one of them saw the wreck coming, of course, in the instant the train lurched out of the station, but no one would listen. Now, at long last, they can tell it all.\"\n\nBut Americans deserved to be told the truth at least a year ago, not months after the 2024 election. The fact that they weren't is a scandal not only for Democrats but much of the legacy media as well.\n\nDemocratic insiders knew that concerns about the president's ability to continue serving were serious. Journalists who covered the president had ample evidence to suggest those concerns were valid.\n\nOnly now, a year too late, are they finally telling us the truth.\n\nNicole Russell is a columnist at USA TODAY and a mother of four who lives in Texas.

Really amazing how it all came out, and how it all ended,” President Trump said, pointing out that the Dodgers had beaten two “home teams” along the way – a reference from the New York native to the Dodgers’ victories over the Mets (in the NL Championship Series) and Yankees (in the World Series).\n\nTrump singled out several players for their contributions to the championship including Shohei Ohtani for his historic 50-50 season, shaking hands with each player as he mentioned their achievements (but mispronouncing reliever Blake Treinen’s name).\n\nFreddie Freeman was not part of the visit. He went on the Injured List with a sprained ankle last weekend and is not traveling with the team on its current road trip.\n\n“He looks like a movie star. He’s got a good future, I’m telling you,” Trump said of Ohtani. “He shattered all of those records last year. … He became the first ever member of the 50-50 club. He had 54 home runs and 59 steals, an accomplishment unparalleled in 149 years of Major League Baseball. Think of that. That’s just incredible.”\n\nThe president also had high praise for Dodgers manager Dave Roberts, calling him “one of the greatest managers, really, ever to wear the Dodger blue.”\n\n“I think he would have lasted even with George Steinbrenner, right?” Trump said, referring to the notoriously quick-triggered Yankees owner. “He was very quick. You lose two games and you were fired. Great job, Dave.”\n\nTrump introduced a number of California representatives in attendance Monday but took a swipe at the state’s two Democratic senators (Alex Padilla and Adam Schiff), saying he wouldn’t introduce them because “I don’t particularly like them.”\n\nNeither senator was in attendance for the event in the East Room. Some Dodgers are scheduled to visit the Capitol on Tuesday.\n\nThough many championship teams skipped the White House visit during Trump’s first term, the Dodgers are the second team to visit already during Trump’s second term, joining the NHL’s Stanley Cup champion Florida Panthers. Dodgers team owner Mark Walter spoke briefly at Monday’s event, saying the Dodgers were “very pleased to participate in the tradition of bringing champions to the White House.”\n\nAs he had in 2021 when President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris hosted the 2020 championship team, Clayton Kershaw stepped forward and read a statement on behalf of the team.\n\n“This is an incredible honor for me to stand here today representing the Los Angeles Dodgers and this group of staff and players standing behind me today,” Kershaw said this time. “The 2024 Los Angeles Dodgers season is one that will go down in the history books, always holding a special place in my heart and those with me as well as the millions of Dodger fans around the world.\n\n“This organization exemplifies what it means to come together as one for a greater purpose and represent something so much bigger than themselves. The selflessness and humility that each one of these players and staff have shown over the last year is truly an inspiration. They have constantly played hurt, switched positions and taken the ball to put the team first.”\n\nReferring to his limited role due to injury during the Dodgers’ postseason run, Kershaw called himself “a spectator for our championship run last year” but said he was “in awe of this group.”\n\n“Their unwavering confidence coupled with the selfless pursuit for team excellence was an inspiration,” Kershaw said. “That is why I am so grateful to get to speak today on their behalf as I know none of them would say this about themselves. Moving forward, I hope the 2024 Dodgers can serve as an inspiration to many like they were to me –not just in sports but in life, remembering to put others before ourselves. It moves a team and a society forward.”\n\nKershaw and Mookie Betts presented Trump with a personalized Dodgers jersey with his name and the number 47 on the back.\n\nAfter the event in the East Room, Trump invited the team to visit “the fabled Oval Office” where they had opportunities to take more photos.","summary":"President Donald Trump praised the Dodgers, singling out several players, for their efforts in winning the 2024 World Series.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/04/07/dodgers-honored-for-their-legendary-season-with-white-house-visit/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25097575636604.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 18:18:44","author":"Bill Plunkett","authors":["Bill Plunkett"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.383},{"id":308691750,"title":"Inside MAGA mayhem: Donald Trump throws Laura Loomer into the ring against GOP powerbroker Susie Wiles in high-stakes turf war","text":"A fierce power struggle is taking place behind closed doors in Donald Trump's orbit, and it's becoming personal.While Melania Trump remains out of the spotlight, two very different women have emerged to compete for influence and it's causing major waves.What’s this inside MAGA mayhem all about?Donald Trump has exacerbated tensions within his inner circle by elevating controversial activist Laura Loomer, positioning her as a rival to campaign strategist Susie Wiles. Susie Wiles, long known as Donald Trump's steady hand, now faces a loud, attention-grabbing challenger in Loomer, resulting in a chaotic power showdown within the Trump world, as quoted in a report by the Daily Beast.ALSO READ: Major shake-up ahead: Elon Musk’s DOGE targets social security with 3 big changes that could hit your retirement benefits The matriarch of the West Wing, Susie Wiles, has been known by her admiring colleagues as the Trump whisperer for her ability to restrain the president's worst impulses.She is the first female White House chief of staff and has used her quiet discipline, which has come to define her, to subtly control the conflicting elements within Trump 2.0. However, it was only able to last so long, as quoted in a report by the Daily Beast.Wiles, who has been fighting to keep mistakes and leaks from overshadowing her boss's agenda, received a reprieve earlier this week when Donald Trump finally agreed to disassociate himself from Elon Musk and his constant social media posts.Why did Donald Trump bring Laura Loomer back now?After Laura Loomer accompanied him on multiple trips in 2023, Wiles was one of those who suggested the president should keep the conspiracy theorist and investigative journalist at a distance.But she's back now. Loomer was the MAGA wrecking ball if Wiles, a moderate Republican, was the whisperer.Susie Wiles had the cool authority of her sportscaster father, Pat Summerall, and held the more gregarious John Madden in check with her grandmotherly manner and smock dresses, as quoted in a report by the Daily Beast.Prior to rising to the position of co-manager of Trump's 2024 campaign, Wiles paid her dues as a scheduler for President Ronald Reagan, worked on the Bush-Quayle ticket in 1988, and worked on election campaigns for Jack Kemp, Mitt Romney, and Ron DeSantis.However, administration sources indicate that Wiles' reasonable voice is being ignored by Donald Trump. The president needs a little distraction because things are getting difficult for him. She is one of the few people who can break bad news to him. He doesn't want to hear it, though, at the moment. How different are Wiles and Loomer behind the scenes?Despite not always being welcomed in the White House, Laura Loomer has emerged as one of the president's most vocal supporters, with her MAGA evangelism and Hervé Léger bandage dresses. She's been called a 9/11 truther and even chastised by Marjorie Taylor Greene for posting a message claiming that the White House will smell like curry & White House speeches will be facilitated via a call centre if Kamala Harris won the election, as quoted in a report by the Daily Beast.Wiles does not accompany the mass migration to Mar-a-Lago every weekend; instead, she remains hidden. Her public visibility at the White House is comparable to Melania's.Loomer, on the other hand, after being banned from Twitter, jumped over Nancy Pelosi's fence in protest of the then-speaker's immigration policies and handcuffed herself to an office. Despite having a political background and having run for Congress twice without success in Florida, she is most known for her divisive comments. Trump's inner circle, and Wiles in particular, are afraid of her weekly Rumble show, Loomer Unleashed. Both women view themselves as crucial female supporters of the president in Melania's absence, but they are unable to cooperate. Susie doesn't appear to be so unbeatable right now, and Loomer has immediately re-entered the president's inner circle.Now, both women compete for the preeminent female voice around the US President. But sources indicate that this isn't a tranquil power-sharing arrangement; it's a vicious struggle that's only getting hotter.FAQsWho is Laura Loomer, and why has she returned?She's a far-right activist who Trump is once again supporting, and it's causing a lot of friction within his team. What is going on with Loomer and Susie Wiles?They are locked in a power struggle for Trump's ear and influence in his 2024 circle.","summary":"A power struggle intensifies within Donald Trump's inner circle as he elevates Laura Loomer, creating a rivalry with campaign strategist Susie Wiles. Wiles, known as the \"Trump whisperer,\" faces a challenge from Loomer's far-right activism, disrupting the established order. The competition between the two women escalates, vying for influence and Trump's attention amidst his 2024 campaign preparations.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/inside-maga-mayhem-donald-trump-throws-laura-loomer-into-the-ring-against-gop-powerbroker-susie-wiles-in-high-stakes-turf-war/articleshow/120072854.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-120072892,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-27472,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 18:06:32","author":"Global Desk","authors":["Global Desk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.194},{"id":308678942,"title":"As the World Turns on Trump, Mexico's Claudia Sheinbaum Has Other Plans","text":"When Claudia Sheinbaum took office as Mexico's first female president last October, her historic rise drew global attention—and quiet skepticism. A scientist by training and a reserved technocrat by reputation, Sheinbaum was seen as cautious and untested in the arena of high-stakes diplomacy.She assumed office just one month before the U.S. presidential election, at the height of a turbulent campaign season when signs were starting to point ward Donald Trump defeating Kamala Harris. Amid swirling speculation, Sheinbaum remained composed. She sidestepped reporters' headline-chasing questions and, when Trump ultimately won, became one of the first world leaders to offer congratulations.Still, doubts lingered—particularly over her ability to manage what is arguably one of the world's most complex bilateral relationships. But while many global leaders are still figuring out how to deal with a second Trump presidency, Sheinbaum is already executing a plan.And it's working.Last week, as Trump unveiled a new 10 percent global baseline tariff and harsher \"reciprocal tariffs\" on most trading partners, Mexico stood out as a notable exception. Thanks to months of groundwork by Sheinbaum and her economic team, Mexico emerged with preferential treatment—confounding skeptics and earning grudging respect from the famously unpredictable U.S. president.\"There are no additional tariffs on Mexico, and that is good for the country,\" Sheinbaum said during a press conference last Thursday. She attributed the exemption to \"the good relationship we have constructed with the U.S. government, based on collaboration but with respect.\"The Most Popular Leader in the Free WorldThat relationship didn't materialize overnight. In the first two months of Trump's term, Mexico faced threats of auto and steel tariffs—twice. Each time, the White House held back, partly due to continued negotiations led by Sheinbaum's team and her personal, measured diplomatic tone.The calm Sheinbaum projects is no accident. Behind the scenes, she has orchestrated a highly disciplined diplomatic strategy to keep Mexico out of Trump's crosshairs—a stark contrast to the more confrontational approaches taken by other U.S. trade partners and neighbors like Canada.\"President Sheinbaum wisely set out some parameters to manage the always complex U.S.-Mexico relationship,\" said Michael Shifter, senior fellow and former president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank focused on international affairs in the Western Hemisphere.\"She expressed willingness to cooperate with the U.S. on immigration and fentanyl while insisting that Mexico would not waver in defending its national sovereignty. Unlike Trump, who is erratic and unpredictable, Sheinbaum is disciplined and focused.\"One of the more revealing moments came during a 45-minute phone call between Sheinbaum and Trump on February 3.Speaking in English—a surprise to Trump, who was said to have found interpreter-assisted talks with her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, tedious and overly long—Sheinbaum proposed deploying 10,000 troops to the border to help curb fentanyl trafficking. The proposal resonated with her counterpart, who paused planned tariff hikes and reportedly told her, \"You're tough,\" according to The New York Times.Her balancing act is also paying off politically at home. \"Her strong posture has been a political boon, stirring nationalist sentiment,\" Shifter noted. \"Her approval level is higher than for any Mexican president in the last 30 years.\"Domestic polling shows her approval rating ranging between 63 and 85 percent, buoyed by a public perception that she is standing up to Trump without needlessly provoking him. At the high end, those numbers make Sheinbaum the most popular democratically-elected leader in the world, surpassing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 75 percent approval.\"She's gaining strength from these tensions,\" said Javier Rosiles Salas, a Mexican political analyst and professor at the Universidad de la Ciénega del Estado de Michoacán. \"In Mexico, Trump is generally seen as an enemy of the country, and Sheinbaum has positioned herself as a defender of national sovereignty.\"Rosiles Salas added that, unlike in Canada—where Trump's tariffs deepened partisan divides—Sheinbaum's approach has unified much of Mexico's political class. \"Even opposition governors are backing her, if reluctantly,\" he said. \"The narrative of standing up to Trump resonates well.\"Playing a Long GameWhile China, Canada, and the European Union scrambled to retaliate or denounce the new tariffs, Sheinbaum stayed the course. \"We will announce a comprehensive program, not a tit-for-tat on tariffs,\" she told reporters on April 2, the day before Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement that sent global markets into a tailspin. Her government followed with an 18-point economic plan focused on strengthening national production and boosting domestic content in key sectors such as autos, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals.\"She has indicated a very open and frank relationship with President Trump and his team while presenting a clear interest in Mexico's interests,\" said Earl Wayne, former U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the Obama administration. \"She seems to have a good sense of the depth and range of these interests.\"Her deputy economy secretary, Luis Rosendo Gutierrez, put it more bluntly: \"The instruction of President Claudia Sheinbaum was to work closely and cool-headed with the United States government, looking for fair and preferential treatment.\"The results followed. Unlike many U.S. allies, Mexico was granted key exemptions from the \"reciprocal\" tariffs. USMCA-compliant exports were spared entirely, while some sectors—like non-compliant auto parts and steel—remain under 25 percent duties. The most aggressive penalties were avoided.That strategy has extended beyond trade. When Trump signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\"—a symbolic move heavy with nationalist overtones—Sheinbaum resisted the urge to wade in. According to one aide, she dryly quipped in private that perhaps parts of the U.S. that once belonged to Mexico should be renamed \"Mexican America.\" But the remark went no further.Martha Bárcena Coqui, the former Mexican ambassador to the U.S., said Sheinbaum understands how much is at stake. \"She's been doing well in maintaining a continuous dialogue with the Trump administration on the many issues that make this relationship so complex,\" Bárcena told CNN.Risks on the HorizonHowever, the risks of this fragile relationship breaking down are very real.\"There is a long way to go in the Sheinbaum-Trump relationship,\" Shifter, of the Inter-American Dialogue, warned. \"No matter what Sheinbaum does to accommodate Trump—whether it's putting Mexican troops on the border or taking in deportees—it never seems to be enough.\"Although the 62-year-old president appears strong now, it's unclear whether her political support would hold if Mexico's economy were to suffer due to renewed U.S. tensions. That could include retaliatory tariffs or a breakdown in joint migration enforcement.\"If there's an economic crisis in Mexico and people lose their jobs, they'll look for work wherever they can find it,\" Bárcena said. \"Mexico can't legally stop them from heading to the border. That would undermine all the joint efforts between Mexico and the U.S. to reduce migration.\"Rosiles Salas, the Mexican political analyst, echoed that concern and warned the greatest danger may not be economic—but security-related. \"If the Mexican government fails to adequately contain criminal groups, it could lead the U.S. to take harsher measures,\" he said. \"This could very well be the breaking point of the 'friendly' relationship.\"For now, Sheinbaum continues to walk the tightrope with a level of precision that would make other world leaders envious. While global heads of state brace themselves for Trump's next move, Mexico's president has already shown that clarity, patience and calm might just be the best way to navigate the storm.\"There are many areas where better mutual understanding is needed,\" said Wayne, the former U.S. ambassador. \"Sheinbaum seems to have a good sense of the depth and range of these interests.\"","summary":"The Mexican president is walking a political tightrope when it comes to her American counterpart, and she as the poll numbers to show for it.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/claudia-sheinbaum-mexico-donald-trump-tariffs-2055581","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2621354/claudia-sheinbaum-mexico.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 17:54:15","author":"Jesus Mesa","authors":["Jesus Mesa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.211},{"id":308680582,"title":"J.K. Rowling Criticizes John Oliver Over ‘Last Week Tonight’ Segment on Trans Athletes: “Read the F***ing Room”","text":"J.K. Rowling is once again taking issue with John Oliver, who addressed right-wing outrage over trans athletes who compete in women’s and girls’ sporting events on Sunday’s Last Week Tonight.\n\n It’s a topic he also addressed in November following the presidential election, wherein Donald Trump defeated Kamala Harris. After taking office this year, Trump signed an executive order to ban transgender athletes from taking part in female-driven sports.\n\n “In our post-election show, I said there are vanishingly few trans girls competing in high school sports anywhere, and even if there were more, trans kids like all kids vary in athletic ability, and there is no evidence that they pose any threat to safety or fairness,” Oliver said on Sunday’s show.\n\n He went on to note that following the broadcast of that episode, Harry Potter mastermind J.K. Rowling posted “the single longest tweet I’ve ever seen in my life” in response.\n\n Oliver read from her post: “I’m happy to watch females suffer injury, humiliation and the loss of sporting opportunities to bolster an elitist postmodern ideology.”\n\n Joked Oliver: “Honestly, it feels a bit weird to catch that much heat from the creator of Harry Potter, especially when I clearly look like what would have happened to him if they’d just left him in that cupboard for the rest of his life.”\n\n He continued: “I stand by everything I said in that episode, but I will concede that this subject is more complicated.”\n\n On Monday morning, Rowling again shared her thoughts on the subject and criticized Oliver’s take. She reposted a message on X that read: “HBO aired a 45 minute episode of Last Week Tonight, in which John Oliver argued that men have only limited or no advantage over women in sports, and men winning in women’s sports almost never happens, on the same evening that a women’s pool final was contested between two men.”\n\n In response, Rowling wrote: “I understand why men like Oliver, who’ve consistently mocked anti-science people on the right, sold out initially. They didn’t want to blow up their careers. Taking fashionable anti-women’s rights positions was the cost of doing business. But it’s time to read the fucking room.”\n\n When a follower replied with, “I can’t imagine willingly appearing this stupid for the sake of political correctness,” Rowling responded: “They’re still regurgitating Twitter TRA talking points from 2020. I can’t imagine anyone being so far up their own backside they haven’t noticed that this nonsensical crap is facing a massive grassroots backlash, that it loses elections and that girls and women are being harmed.”\n\n In November, Oliver criticized Harris and the Democrats for not doing more to publicly support trans people during the 2024 presidential campaign. He said that it should have been “pretty easy” to come up with a response to right-wing criticism.\n\n “There are vanishingly few trans girls competing in high schools anywhere,” he said at the time. “Even if there were more, trans kids, like all kids, vary in athletic ability, and there is no evidence they pose any threat to safety or fairness. … And finally, if you genuinely want to address the biggest concern for most girls who play high school sports, you’d be less worried about this and more about the creepy assistant volleyball coach who keeps liking their posts on fucking Instagram.”\n\n After that episode aired, Rowling posted that Oliver is “an undoubtedly intelligent person [who] spouts absolute bullshit to support something he wants to be true, but isn’t.”\n\n “Again and again I’ve come up against men who argue exactly what Oliver does here, using the very same talking points,” Rowling wrote. “With a straight face, the ‘believe the science’ guys will say ‘actually, we don’t yet have enough data to say whether men and boys are stronger and faster than women and girls’. The ‘be kind’ crew can’t see what the issue is.”\n\n She continued: “If you want to tell the world you’re happy to watch females suffer injury, humiliation and the loss of sporting opportunities to bolster an elitist post-modern ideology embraced by a minute fraction of the world’s population, fair enough; you’re allowed your opinion. But if you’ve just told girls they don’t deserve fair sport, maybe rethink using all too real and common sexual predation against young women as a punchline for your ‘edgy’ closing joke.”\n\n Oliver and Rowling both hail from England (Oliver became an American citizen in 2019). They also both have ties with HBO: Oliver’s show is an HBO property, while the network is also working on a Harry Potter series for which Rowling serves as an executive producer.\n\n Watch the Last Week Tonight segment below and read what Oliver had to say about Trump’s tariff plan.","summary":"The Harry Potter author posted: \"I understand why men like Oliver, who've consistently mocked anti-science people on the right, sold out initially.

The Tesla chief was branded an ‘un-elected, South African nepo-baby’ by Walz this week at a town hall in Wisconsin titled ‘The People vs Musk’, where Walz took aim at the electric car maker’s 41.4 percent stock fall as of March. ‘On the iPhone, they’ve got that little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day,’ Walz said at the event.\n\nIn response, Musk ridiculed Walz over his heavy election defeat in November alongside Kamala Harris , saying he gets the same ‘boost’ when he remembers their drubbing. ‘Sometimes when I need a little boost, I look at the @JDVance portrait in the White House and thank the Lord,’ Musk wrote on X. The White House’s ‘Rapid Response’ account piled on, adding in its own post alongside Vance and President Trump’s official portraits: ‘When we need a little boost during the day at the White House, we walk around the corner from our office and admire these beautiful portraits.’\n\nIt comes as Walz has faced backlash from conservatives for his remarks at the town hall, with some accusing him of celebrating the downfall of a key American-based company. The GOP House Judiciary said the Minnesota Governor exhibited ‘disgusting behavior’, while Texas Senator Ted Cruz branded him a ‘small, petty, vindictive, evil [expletive]’ who ‘represents today’s Democrats well.’ Walz’s remarks on Tesla’s struggles come as some customers revolt against his intimate ties to the Trump White House, with liberal groups calling for a boycott of the electric car manufacturer.\n\nTesla vehicles and facilities across America have also been targeted by vandalism and attacks in recent weeks, including in Las Vegas this week where several of the vehicles were firebombed . The FBI launched an investigation into the attack, and Attorney General Pam Bondi branded the incident ‘nothing short of domestic terrorism.’\n\nWalz’s speech aimed at Musk comes as the former VP candidate has been on a media blitz in recent weeks, fueling speculation that he is considering a run for president in 2028. When pressed by the New Yorker earlier this month, the 60-year-old did not rule out a run for the White House. ‘Look I never had an ambition to be President or Vice President. I was honored to be asked,’ he said. ‘If I feel like I can serve, I will. And if nationally, people are like, “Dude we tried you and look how that worked out,” I’m good with that.’\n\nWhen the politician was then asked point-blank whether he would ever run for president, he replied: ‘Well I had a friend tell me, “Never turn down a job you haven’t been offered.” ‘If I think I could offer something… I would certainly consider that. I’m also, though, not arrogant enough to believe there’s a lot of people that can do this.’ He then explained that if the circumstances are right in 2028 and he has the right ‘skill set’ for the moment, ‘I’ll do it.’\n\n‘I’ll do whatever it takes. I certainly wouldn’t be arrogant enough to think that it needs to be me. While Walz weighs a run for president, he faces the prospect of the world’s richest man dampening his hopes. Musk’s insult hurled at Walz this week was far from his first, with the Tesla chief mocking Walz’s November defeat last month as well.\n\nWalz said in an X post that ‘the richest man in the world is sitting at the Resolute Desk, about to defund your public school. Trump should stop him.’ Musk responded: ‘What’s your name again? I forgot.’\n\nIn another exchange days earlier, Musk mocked Walz’s moves as Governor in Minnesota to allow tampons to be placed in boy’s bathrooms in schools. After Walz said that Musk was ‘a terrible president’, Musk responded with a meme of an elderly character from the movie Up ridiculing Walz.\n\nWant more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

I would watch him beat guys up at a bar. He was a karate guy.’\n\nRogan’s father, now a retired New Jersey cop in his 80s, has vehemently denied the allegations. Indeed, they haven’t been repeated since Joseph Sr’s attorneys sent Rogan a letter warning against the ‘defamatory statements’ in 2022.\n\nBut his claims of a violent upbringing have continued to raise eyebrows – not least from Rogan’s own half-sister.\n\nRosa Rogan Lunelli, 46, has told the Daily Mail she has never met her famous relative and angrily rejects the claims he has levelled against their elderly father.\n\n‘Ever since Joe’s receipt of the attorneys’ letter, he has no longer spoken about his claims of abuse,’ Rosa says. \n\n‘My family adamantly denies those claims. There has been no contact on Joe’s part with wanting to meet our father nor us.’\n\nIt’s a point of regret for MAGA supporter Rosa, who says she felt ‘proud’ when Rogan interviewed Donald Trump last October during a three-hour conversation that helped propel the President back into the White House.\n\n‘It was absolutely an influential moment of the campaign when Joe interviewed Donald Trump before the election,’ she told the Daily Mail.\n\n‘Our family fully supports President Trump and his agenda and what made it so influential is it was something that was never done before.\n\n‘Joe has the ability to shape people’s thoughts, feelings and attitudes through his podcast, so bringing President Trump on was huge. Our family was happy the podcast was so successful for the Trump campaign.’\n\nSo what is the truth of Rogan’s extraordinary backstory, which saw him rise from a troubled childhood to one of the most powerful media titans in the US?\n\nBorn in Newark in 1967 to Joseph Sr. and his mother Susan, Rogan’s parents split when he was five.\n\nHe and his mom then moved to San Francisco two years later while his father remarried and had two daughters, Rosa and Bridget. Father and son have not spoken since. \n\nA young Rogan settled in the suburb of Haight-Ashbury, which he has described as ‘the middle of hippie San Francisco’.\n\nHis new neighbors were a gay couple who his mom would ‘get naked with and play the bongos and smoke pot’. Susan soon remarried herself, to a ‘hippie’ computer programmer who Rogan has never named publicly.\n\nDescribing his new life in SF on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, he’s said: ‘All of a sudden I’m living with this hippie guy in San Francisco around a bunch of gay people. I went from living around these Italian, New Jersey psychopaths to San Francisco, peace and love.’\n\nAs a teenager, Rogan moved again to Newton, Massachusetts, where he struggled at a new high school and took up karate to feel more confident. \n\n‘I was really terrified about being a loser. That was my No. 1 fear in life,’ he recalled in 2014. ‘I was scared of the future. Martial arts gave me not just confidence, but also a different perspective of myself and what I was capable of. I knew that I could do something I was terrified of.\n\n‘I do not think I would have ever become who I am if I didn’t learn martial arts at a very early age. I think the best decision I ever made in my entire life was to immerse myself in something so incredibly difficult.’\n\nIndeed, it was an experience that would prove instrumental in landing Rogan a gig in 2002 as a Ultimate Fighting Championship commentator, where he quickly made his name.\n\nAt the time, a 35-year-old Rogan was making ends meet as an actor and stand-up comedian, and he had just started hosting for the NBC gameshow Fear Factor.\n\nBut he caught the eye of UFC chief Dana White, who had taken over control of the fighting championship the previous year. \n\nWhite had been packing up VHS tapes to move from New York to the UFC’s new headquarters in Las Vegas. He played one at random and, by pure coincidence, it showed Rogan being interviewed about Fear Factor. But as White recalls, ‘all he would talk about was UFC… and what UFC fighters would do to martial arts guys in the movies. I was like “this is exactly what I need”.’ \n\nRogan was so passionate about the championships that his first 13 appearances doing color commentary were for free. But he quickly established himself as a knowledgeable and popular presenter.\n\n‘Early on, nobody understood the ground game,’ White, a close Trump ally himself, said last year. ‘Rogan would walk you through what was happening literally before it would happen. \n\n‘He would tell you the setup, what would come next and he would articulate it perfectly, brilliantly, and people at home started to understand. The impact that Joe Rogan has had, and continues to have, on this sport is immeasurable.’\n\nRogan continued hosting Fear Factor until 2006 when he got into a fight with a contestant, whose wife Rogan had criticized for punching a rival. The show was cancelled that same year for unrelated reasons. \n\nBut he remained a prominent fixture at UFC where his theatrical reactions to knockouts made him go viral.\n\nIn 2021, he famously interviewed Conor McGregor minutes after the bloodied UFC fighter broke his leg during a match. Then, a year later, he was filmed thrashing around in his chair during a dramatic fight between Leon Edwards and Kamaru Usman.\n\nBut his stratospheric rise to superstardom came through his podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, which he launched in 2009. He quickly found momentum and, within two years, had signed a deal with radio service SiriusXM.\n\nThen in 2020, he made the big time: signing a staggering $200 million deal with Spotify, where he now has 14.5 million followers along with 20 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nAnd with those numbers has come great influence – and not to mention controversy. On the show, Rogan has wildly theorized on why the moon landings might be fake, whether Egyptians really built the Pyramids, and he was even accused of pushing anti-vaccine views during the pandemic.\n\nPrevious guests have included scientists, astrophysicists, and authors such as North Korean defector Yeonmi Park, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn 2019, it was thought he could be the kingmaker for the Democrats after interviewing Bernie Sanders and endorsing him to be the party’s candidate in the upcoming election. \n\nBut five years later, his political ideology shifted – with Rogan interviewing the likes of Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nTrump was desperate to land Rogan’s endorsement in the 2024 election, urging him to back the GOP throughout his three-hour podcast interview. But Rogan didn’t grant it until the 11th hour – and only after Rogan and Trump’s Democrat rival Kamala Harris had failed to agree on terms over an equivalent appearance.\n\n‘Joe Rogan just endorsed me, isn’t that great?’ Trump said on the eve of the election after learning the news in Pittsburgh. ‘He doesn’t do that, he doesn’t do that stuff. And he tends to be a little bit more liberal than some of the people in this room.’\n\nRogan and his wife Jessica Ditzel, a cocktail waitress who he married in 2009, were guests of honor at the President’s inauguration in January.\n\nAnd yet, it seems, cracks are beginning to show. \n\nRogan made headlines last week after appearing to criticize Trump’s mass migration policy, saying that innocent people could languish in a ‘hell on earth’. \n\n‘You got to get scared that people who are not criminals are getting, like, lassoed up and deported and sent to, like, El Salvador prisons. This is kind of crazy that that could be possible. That’s horrific,’ he warned.\n\nAll of this, however, means little to Rogan’s estranged family back in Newark. \n\nIn the sleepy suburb of Kearny, home to just 40,000 people, the Manhattan skyline looms large and Trump flags flutter outside homes.

The market didn’t wait for Harris — it’s unraveling under Trump himself. In just a few short weeks since Inauguration Day, Wall Street has taken a nosedive, sending investors into panic mode and shattering records for all the wrong reasons. The S&P 500 has already dropped 15% since Trump took office in January, and it’s teetering dangerously close to bear market territory. If it falls just a little more — to the 20% mark — it’ll become the fastest descent into a bear market ever recorded at the start of a U.S. presidency. That's not just bad; that's historic. The turning point? A fiery event dubbed “Liberation Day,” where President Trump promised aggressive, sweeping tariffs that rattled investors. Since then, Wall Street has been in free fall — nearly two-thirds of the total market drop has happened after that single speech. Trump’s bold tariffs, dubbed Trump Tariffs 2.0, are being compared to past economic shocks like the 1973 oil crisis. Ed Yardeni, a respected market analyst, didn’t sugarcoat it: “Liberation Day has been followed by Annihilation Days.” It’s rare to see a stock market this volatile so early into a president’s term — the only somewhat similar case was George W. Bush in 2001, but he inherited a market already weakened by the bursting dot-com bubble. Trump, however, took the reins during a strong bull market. That’s what makes this moment so shocking.How bad is this for the average american and main street? A lot of people still think of Wall Street as this mysterious place where only the wealthy play. But here’s the thing — over 60% of Americans are invested in the stock market in some way, thanks to retirement accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s. So when the market falls, it hits home for a lot of folks. “Wall Street is Main Street,” Yardeni said. And right now, both streets are suffering. American businesses are facing massive disruptions from the new tariffs, and consumers are feeling the pinch. Prices are rising, confidence is dipping, and portfolios are bleeding. David Kotok, an expert from Cumberland Advisors, warns that these tariffs are acting like a giant tax on American consumers — the kind that sparks inflation while also slowing growth. That’s the nightmare scenario: stagflation. It’s like pressing the gas and the brake at the same time — the economy can’t move forward.Are we heading into a full-blown recession soon? That’s the million-dollar question. Technically, we’re not in a recession — yet. But the signs are stacking up. Major banks are flashing warning lights: JPMorgan bumped the odds of a recession to 60%, while Goldman Sachs doubled its prediction from 20% to 45%. HSBC is hovering at 40%. Economic growth is slowing fast. Some forecasts show GDP could slip into negative territory as early as this quarter. If that happens again next quarter, boom — that’s a textbook recession. The last time the U.S. saw back-to-back GDP drops in a president’s first year — without a prior recession — was all the way back in 1953, following the Korean War. In Trump’s case, the conflict is economic: a full-scale trade war of his own making.Can consumer confidence and spending hold up under this pressure? Confidence is a fragile thing. When people see their retirement savings drop and hear whispers of recession, they start spending less. And that, in turn, weakens the economy even more. RBC Capital Markets points out that in past recessions, the average drop in the S&P 500 was around 27%. If we’re already down 15%, and a recession hits? There’s still room to fall — a lot of room. As someone who remembers the sting of 2008 and the chaos of the early COVID days in 2020, this moment feels eerily familiar. You start questioning every purchase, wondering if it’s better to save than to spend. That mindset, when shared by millions, has real consequences.So what’s next for Trump’s economy and the stock market? That’s the trillion-dollar question. Trump built his comeback campaign on the promise of economic strength — now he's facing a brutal reality check. Investors are losing faith, businesses are bracing for impact, and consumers are tightening their belts. Could the market bounce back? Sure. But right now, the trends are heading in the wrong direction. The economy feels like it’s standing on a ledge, and if confidence slips any further, we might all go over together. One thing’s for sure — the early days of Trump’s second term have already secured a place in financial history books. And unfortunately for many Americans, it’s not the kind of record you want to break.FAQs:What caused the Trump stock market crash? Trump's new tariffs triggered investor fears and market panic. Is the Trump economy heading for a recession? Experts say a Trump-led recession is increasingly likely in 2025.","summary":"Trump stock market crash is making headlines as Wall Street reels from the worst market start ever under a modern president. Despite inheriting a booming bull market, Donald Trump's second term is off to a historic low, with the S&amp;P 500 dropping 15% and nearing a bear market. Investors are panicking, retirement accounts are shrinking, and fears of a Trump-led recession are growing. Fueled by aggressive tariffs and economic uncertainty, experts warn the fallout could be worse than past crashes.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/wall-streets-historic-meltdown-investors-reeling-as-donald-trump-sets-record-for-worst-stock-market-debut-of-any-president-in-modern-american-history/articleshow/120071394.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-120071656,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-153352,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 17:07:21","author":"Global Desk","authors":["Global Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.3},{"id":308686876,"title":"Dodgers celebrated at White House for 2024 World Series title by Trump","text":"With portraits of George Washington and Theodore Roosevelt adorning the walls, and grand golden chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the Dodgers received a champion’s welcome in the East Room of the White House on Monday morning, applauded by a packed crowd awaiting their arrival for their 2024 World Series celebration. Then, once they were all in place on a stage at the front of the room, President Trump entered to personally congratulate them on last season’s title. \"Legendary season,” Trump said, with Dodgers players, coaches, executives and owner Mark Walter standing around him. \"Over the course of this amazing season, the members of this team gave us some of the most incredible performances ever seen on the baseball diamond.\" When the Dodgers announced last month they would visit Trump’s White House this week, while in town for a road series against the Washington Nationals, it triggered an avalanche of reactions from fans and others around the baseball world. Three months into his second term in office, Trump remains a polarizing figure — especially in Los Angeles, where Kamala Harris received more than twice as many votes as he did among L.A. county voters in the 2024 election. But, the Dodgers cited the trip as nothing more than upholding tradition, despite pressure from some factions of their fan base to decline the invitation. “We’re very pleased,” Walter said Monday, “to participate in the tradition of bringing champions to the White House.” Every returning member of the 2024 team on this week’s road trip participated in the visit; including manager Dave Roberts (who said in 2019 he wouldn’t visit the White House if the Dodgers won a World Series during Trump’s first term) and shortstop Mookie Betts (who declined to visit the White House with the Boston Red Sox while Trump was first in office in 2019). The only notable absence was first baseman Freddie Freeman, who remained in Los Angeles this week to nurse an ankle injury that landed him on the injured list. After Trump made his entrance and delivered general opening remarks — in which he touted the falling price of eggs, and declined to acknowledge California Democratic senators Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla by name because \"I don't particularly like them\" — he then spent 10 minutes lauding the Dodgers’ 2024 accomplishments The praise started with Roberts, who was once the target of social media criticisms from Trump during the 2018 World Series, but was told by the President on Monday that he is “one of the greatest managers, really, ever to wear the Dodger blue.” Then, Trump listed off several of Shohei Ohtani’s accomplishments from his unprecedented 50-homer, 50-steal performance last season, before joking that the reigning National League MVP “looks like a movie star.” Trump also highlighted the contributions of Betts, Max Muncy, Yoshinobu Yamamoto, Kiké Hernández, Teoscar Hernández and Clayton Kershaw — who also took the mic to give remarks, and presented Trump with a custom Dodgers jersey bearing his name. “This is an incredible honor for me to stand here today representing the Los Angeles Dodgers and this group of staff and players standing behind me today,” said Kershaw, who was one of several other players on the injured list who flew to Washington to join the team for the event. “The 2024 Los angeles Dodgers season is one that will go down in the history books, always holding a special place in my heart and those with me, as well as the millions of Dodger fans around the world.” Before taking the team back for a tour of the Oval Office, Trump also offered a prediction about the Dodgers’ chances of repeating as champions in 2025. “After seeing how successful you've begun this season, I can tell you that you can plan on being back here,” Trump said. “I hope you're going to be back here next year.”","summary":"The Dodgers visited the White House on Monday as players, coaches, staff and ownership were hosted by President Trump in a ceremony in the East Room honoring their World Series title.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgers/story/2025-04-07/dodgers-white-house-president-trump-2024-world-series","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7432200/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3397x1783+0+241/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F2b%2F79%2F9c4f46e14a9088ae326887100baf%2Ftrump-54501.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 17:03:01","author":"Jack Harris","authors":["Jack Harris"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.334},{"id":308659430,"title":"Joe Rogan fled 'violent' father for San Francisco's gay scene... now his estranged sister breaks her silence to tell a very different story about his path to $200m superstardom","text":"Of all the controversial men Joe Rogan has encountered over the years, one appears to have had a darker impact than most.\n\n'My dad would have turned me into a f***ing psychopath,' the 57-year-old podcaster once said of his father, Joseph Sr.\n\n'He was crazy, he was a psychotic person... someone who can't keep it together. I would watch him beat guys up at a bar. He was a karate guy.'\n\nRogan's father, now a retired New Jersey cop in his 80s, has vehemently denied the allegations. Indeed, they haven't been repeated since Joseph Sr's attorneys sent Rogan a letter warning against the 'defamatory statements' in 2022.\n\nBut his claims of a violent upbringing have continued to raise eyebrows - not least from Rogan's own half-sister.\n\nRosa Rogan Lunelli, 46, has told the Daily Mail she has never met her famous relative and angrily rejects the claims he has levelled against their elderly father.\n\n'Ever since Joe's receipt of the attorneys' letter, he has no longer spoken about his claims of abuse,' Rosa says. \n\n'My family adamantly denies those claims. There has been no contact on Joe's part with wanting to meet our father nor us.'\n\nIt's a point of regret for MAGA supporter Rosa, who says she felt 'proud' when Rogan interviewed Donald Trump last October during a three-hour conversation that helped propel the President back into the White House.\n\n'It was absolutely an influential moment of the campaign when Joe interviewed Donald Trump before the election,' she told the Daily Mail.\n\n'Our family fully supports President Trump and his agenda and what made it so influential is it was something that was never done before.\n\n'Joe has the ability to shape people's thoughts, feelings and attitudes through his podcast, so bringing President Trump on was huge. Our family was happy the podcast was so successful for the Trump campaign.'\n\nSo what is the truth of Rogan's extraordinary backstory, which saw him rise from a troubled childhood to one of the most powerful media titans in the US?\n\nBorn in Newark in 1967 to Joseph Sr. and his mother Susan, Rogan's parents split when he was five.\n\nHe and his mom then moved to San Francisco two years later while his father remarried and had two daughters, Rosa and Bridget. Father and son have not spoken since. \n\nA young Rogan settled in the suburb of Haight-Ashbury, which he has described as 'the middle of hippie San Francisco'.\n\nHis new neighbors were a gay couple who his mom would 'get naked with and play the bongos and smoke pot'. Susan soon remarried herself, to a 'hippie' computer programmer who Rogan has never named publicly.\n\nDescribing his new life in SF on his podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, he's said: 'All of a sudden I'm living with this hippie guy in San Francisco around a bunch of gay people. I went from living around these Italian, New Jersey psychopaths to San Francisco, peace and love.'\n\nAs a teenager, Rogan moved again to Newton, Massachusetts, where he struggled at a new high school and took up karate to feel more confident. \n\n'I was really terrified about being a loser. That was my No. 1 fear in life,' he recalled in 2014. 'I was scared of the future. Martial arts gave me not just confidence, but also a different perspective of myself and what I was capable of. I knew that I could do something I was terrified of.\n\n'I do not think I would have ever become who I am if I didn't learn martial arts at a very early age. I think the best decision I ever made in my entire life was to immerse myself in something so incredibly difficult.'\n\nIndeed, it was an experience that would prove instrumental in landing Rogan a gig in 2002 as a Ultimate Fighting Championship commentator, where he quickly made his name.\n\nAt the time, a 35-year-old Rogan was making ends meet as an actor and stand-up comedian, and he had just started hosting for the NBC gameshow Fear Factor.\n\nBut he caught the eye of UFC chief Dana White, who had taken over control of the fighting championship the previous year. \n\nWhite had been packing up VHS tapes to move from New York to the UFC's new headquarters in Las Vegas. He played one at random and, by pure coincidence, it showed Rogan being interviewed about Fear Factor. But as White recalls, 'all he would talk about was UFC... and what UFC fighters would do to martial arts guys in the movies. I was like \"this is exactly what I need\".' \n\nRogan was so passionate about the championships that his first 13 appearances doing color commentary were for free. But he quickly established himself as a knowledgeable and popular presenter.\n\n'Early on, nobody understood the ground game,' White, a close Trump ally himself, said last year. 'Rogan would walk you through what was happening literally before it would happen. \n\n'He would tell you the setup, what would come next and he would articulate it perfectly, brilliantly, and people at home started to understand. The impact that Joe Rogan has had, and continues to have, on this sport is immeasurable.'\n\nRogan continued hosting Fear Factor until 2006 when he got into a fight with a contestant, whose wife Rogan had criticized for punching a rival. The show was cancelled that same year for unrelated reasons. \n\nBut he remained a prominent fixture at UFC where his theatrical reactions to knockouts made him go viral.\n\nIn 2021, he famously interviewed Conor McGregor minutes after the bloodied UFC fighter broke his leg during a match. Then, a year later, he was filmed thrashing around in his chair during a dramatic fight between Leon Edwards and Kamaru Usman.\n\nBut his stratospheric rise to superstardom came through his podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, which he launched in 2009. He quickly found momentum and, within two years, had signed a deal with radio service SiriusXM.\n\nThen in 2020, he made the big time: signing a staggering $200 million deal with Spotify, where he now has 14.5 million followers along with 20 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nAnd with those numbers has come great influence - and not to mention controversy. On the show, Rogan has wildly theorized on why the moon landings might be fake, whether Egyptians really built the Pyramids, and he was even accused of pushing anti-vaccine views during the pandemic.\n\nPrevious guests have included scientists, astrophysicists, and authors such as North Korean defector Yeonmi Park, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nIn 2019, it was thought he could be the kingmaker for the Democrats after interviewing Bernie Sanders and endorsing him to be the party's candidate in the upcoming election. \n\nBut five years later, his political ideology shifted - with Rogan interviewing the likes of Trump and Elon Musk.\n\nTrump was desperate to land Rogan's endorsement in the 2024 election, urging him to back the GOP throughout his three-hour podcast interview. But Rogan didn't grant it until the 11th hour - and only after Rogan and Trump's Democrat rival Kamala Harris had failed to agree on terms over an equivalent appearance.\n\n'Joe Rogan just endorsed me, isn't that great?' Trump said on the eve of the election after learning the news in Pittsburgh. 'He doesn’t do that, he doesn’t do that stuff. And he tends to be a little bit more liberal than some of the people in this room.'\n\nRogan and his wife Jessica Ditzel, a cocktail waitress who he married in 2009, were guests of honor at the President's inauguration in January.\n\nAnd yet, it seems, cracks are beginning to show. \n\nRogan made headlines last week after appearing to criticize Trump's mass migration policy, saying that innocent people could languish in a 'hell on earth'. \n\n'You got to get scared that people who are not criminals are getting, like, lassoed up and deported and sent to, like, El Salvador prisons. This is kind of crazy that that could be possible. That's horrific,' he warned.\n\nAll of this, however, means little to Rogan's estranged family back in Newark. \n\nIn the sleepy suburb of Kearny, home to just 40,000 people, the Manhattan skyline looms large and Trump flags flutter outside homes. You wonder how many residents know that the old man who is always in a Pittsburgh Steelers jacket and cap is, in fact, Rogan's father.\n\n'I’m in my 80s, I’m in the rearview mirror,' Joseph Sr. said in 2022. 'But I would like to see him. I definitely would sit down with him because he needs to listen to my side of the story. He never asked, didn’t know what I have to say. He doesn’t know how much it hurt me, and what I had to go through.","summary":"Of all the controversial men Joe Rogan has encountered over the years, one appears to have had a darker impact than most.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-14539287/Joe-Rogan-violent-father-San-Francisco-1970s-gay-scene-path-king.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/26/19/96604079-0-image-m-35_1743017032621.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 16:59:59","author":"Editor,Jack Bezants","authors":["Editor","Jack Bezants"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.131},{"id":308666328,"title":"Former Black Panther Mansa Musa on how to fight Trump: ‘Get organized!’","text":"Mansa Musa, host of Rattling the Bars, spent 48 years in prison before his release in 2019. At the invitation of the UMD College Park Young Democratic Socialists of America, Mansa delivered a lecture on his life behind bars and the political struggles of prisoners.\n\nProducer / Videographer / Post-Production: Cameron Granadino\n\nThe following is a rushed transcript and may contain errors. A proofread version will be made available as soon as possible.\n\nMansa Musa:\n\nI hope that at the end of this conversation that we have, that y’all will be more enlightened about what direction y’all want to go in in terms of changing social conditions as they exist now. As she said, my government name is Charles Hopkins. I go by the name of Mansa Musa. Prior to getting out in December the 5th, 2019, I did 48 years in prison. Prior to going to prison, I was a heroin addict, a petty criminal, and that’s what got me in prison.\n\nI went in early, I went in ’72, and during the seventies was a tumultuous time in this country. You had Kent State, you had Attica, you had Puerto Rican nationalists taking over the hospital in Bronx, you had the rise of the Black Panther Party in terms of becoming one of the most formidable fighting formations in this country. So you had a lot going on in society, but more important, the number one thing you had going on in society during that time that cost every sector in society was the war in Vietnam. Everywhere you looked, you had protests about the war in Vietnam. And you’re talking about every day somewhere in this country, 75,000, 10,000, 15,000.\n\nPeople was coming out protesting the war in Vietnam and the establishment’s response was to suppress the movement, to suppress the war in Vietnam. Anybody who was anti-war, their attitude was suppressive. And what got people in an uproar about it was when the media started showing them bringing back United States citizens bodies, and the coffins they was bringing back, they was bringing them back in numbers. So society started looking and said, “Well, this is not a good thing because a lot of people dying.”\n\nAnd in my neighborhood, I lived in projects in Southeast, my brother in ’68, back then they had, the way they had the draft was, it was like the lottery. Literally that’s what it was. They had balls that rolled up and your number came up, A1, A1. In my neighborhood in the projects in Southeast, my brother graduated in ’68, and in 68, the whole entire, everybody that graduated from high school, the men, was gone to Vietnam. So this shaped the attitude of the country. But more importantly, a lot of people that were coming back from the war in Vietnam was radicalized. And because they experienced a lot of segregation, a lot of classes in the military, a lot of them came back and joined the Black Panther Party.\n\nDuring that period, the Black Panther Party was, according to Hoover, the number one threat in the country. So the response to them being the number one threat in the country was to eradicate them. Assassination. They killed Fred Hampton, assassinated Fred Hampton, little Bobby Hutton, they assassinated him. And they locked up a lot of Panthers. That’s how I became a Panther because they locked up a Panther named Eddie Conway, Marshal Eddie Conway. And they set him up and locked him up. And I got some information over there, y’all can pick it up when y’all leave.\n\nWhen he came, so when you got the encouragement of Panthers coming into the prison system, prisoners are becoming politicized. Petty criminals like myself are becoming politicized because now we’re looking at the conditions that we’re living under and we’re looking at them from a political perspective, like why the medical was bad, why the food is garbage, why are we in overcrowded cells? Why is this cell designed for a dog? You got two people in it.\n\nSo these things started like resonating with people, but the Panthers started educating people about understanding, raising their consciousness about this is why these things are going on and this is what your response would be. So that got me into a space where I started reading more, because that was one of the things that we did. We did a lot of reading. You had to read one hour a day and exercise. But more importantly, you organized the population around changing their attitude about the conditions. Because up until that point, everything in prison was a kind of predatory.\n\nThen when you had the Attica Rebellion, that created a chain reaction through the country, with the most celebrity political prisoner in prison that got politicized in prison was George Jackson. George Jackson was a prisoner in San Quentin. He spent most of his time in what now they call solitary confinement. They call it the Adjustment Center. Back then in San Quentin. Him and three or two other political prisoners was locked up in [inaudible 00:05:06] killing a correctional officer. After the San Quentin police had killed… [inaudible 00:05:14] police had killed some prisoners in the courtyard who were wrecking. And it was a dispute between white prisoners and Black prisoners. The only prisoners that got killed was Black prisoners. So that created a chain reaction in the prison system.\n\nFast forward, so this became my incursion into the political apparatus in prison. While in prison, and some of the things I did in prison, my whole thinking back then when I was in prison was I didn’t want to die in prison. I had life and I didn’t want to die in prison. So I would probably go down in the World Book of Guinness for the most failed attempted escapes ever. And if I would sit back here and go back over some of the things I did, it would be kind of comical. But in my mind, I did not want to die. I could have died, I could walk, literally come out on the other side of the fence and fall out and be dead, as long as I didn’t die in prison. It was just a thing about being [inaudible 00:06:19].\n\nAnd in 2001, a case came out in the Maryland system called Merle Unger, Unger v. State. They said anyone locked up between 1970 and 1980 was entitled to a new trial. So I was entitled to a new trial because of the way they was giving the jury instructions. So at that time, everybody was getting ready to come out. Eddie Conway was on his way out. So everybody’s coming out. Now we’re able, we did a lot of organizing in prison. We had organized political education classes, we had organized forums where we had a thing where they say, “Just say your own words.” We brought political leaders in, radicals in to talk about, had books that they had a political discussion in a forum much like this. And it changed the whole prison population thinking about the way they thought about themselves and the way they thought about themselves in relation to society. So all of us coming out now.\n\nAnd when I got out, I got out December the 5th of 2019. I got out, I had, they gave me $50 and let me out in Baltimore City. I’m from Washington D.C. They let me out in Baltimore City and I’m standing there with $50. I don’t know nothing. I don’t know how to use a cellphone, I don’t know how to get on the bus, I don’t know how to get from one corner to… I know the area because the area is the prison where the prison was at, where I lived at all my life. So I know the street name. I know this is Green Mount, I know this is Madison, I know the street, I know these streets, but I never seen, that’s like me knowing somewhere I read something about something in Paris. I know the name of the street, but put me there and I wouldn’t know what to do.\n\nSo this is the situation I found myself in and I didn’t know what, my family knew I was coming out, but I didn’t know whether they knew this particular time. And so I got $50. I see somebody coming with a cellphone and I’m like, “Look, I got, can I use?” He said, “No, I’m going to get on the bus.” So it was an elderly woman coming off. I said, “Look, miss, I was locked up 48 years. I got $50. You can get 25 of them. I just need you to call this number and tell my people.” And I heard somebody calling from the side, was my family.\n\nNow I’m out. While I’m out, I’m out December the 5th of 2019. It was a major event that came right in that period, COVID. So now I’m like, I’m out in society, but really I’m back in prison because the whole country was locked down. So for most people it was a discomfort. For me, I was like, “Oh, this is all right. I can walk.” You know, I’m like basically walking, like I’m walking in, I’m coming back in. I’m not, you know, there’s not a whole lot going on, so you know. And I’m working out and people dealing with each other from afar. You see the same people, everybody like, “I see you, you have a group.” And we started having like a distant social relationship like, “Hey, how y’all doing? How you doing?” And keep it moving right?\n\nAfter I got out and when COVID peaked out, I was doing some organizing in Gilmor projects in Baltimore, and backstory on that, we had took a house in Gilmor Projects, which is exactly what it is, Gilmor and their projects. Real notorious. So we took a house, we found out it was city property, we took it, renovated it and made it community property, and we started doing stuff for the kids. Because Eddie, Eddie Conway’s attitude, he’s like, “Kids don’t have no light in their face. It’s real dark.” So we started doing Easter egg hunts, showing movies on the wall, you know, doing all kinds of activities, gardening to get the kids to be kids.\n\nAnd we took it and when we took it, we say, “We taking this house.” We put the city on and we had a press conference, “Yeah, we took this house, we doing this for the community. Y’all got a problem with that, y’all come down here and tell the community that they can’t have this house.” So the city pretty much like, “Ah, whatever, we ain’t going down there and messing with them people.” So we did, we gave out coats. So this is our organizing.\n\nSee, our organizing method was you meet people with their needs, you meet people’s needs. So it’s not only about giving out food and giving clothing, it’s about having a political education environment where you can teach people how to, you know, you got the analogy of Jesus saying like teach people how to fish. Right? Okay, I already know how to fish, now tell me how to survive. Tell me how to store, tell me how to build, tell me how to build out. So this is the things that we was doing and we would put ourselves in a position, we would network with legal organizations. The people had issues with their rent and we know it was a slum lord environment. And we would educate people about this is how you get your rights recognized.\n\nSo Eddie, and I’m going to talk about Eddie often, right? Because that was my mentor. Ultimately, he got lung cancer and passed away December, February the 13th a couple of years ago. He passed away the day before my birthday. My birthday was February the 14th. And I was like, when his wife called me and said, “Eddie is getting ready, you know, transition. They in Vegas, can you come out here?” And I’m like, I can’t come out there. But the only thing I’m saying is like, man, whatever you do, don’t die on my birthday. I’m like, because I ain’t going to be able to take it. I ain’t going to have no birthday no more. It’s already sad for me to have to deal with it the day before, but I just didn’t want that memory of him.\n\nBut long story short, this individual was responsible for changing the mindset of a lot of prisoners and getting us to think outside the box more or less, right? Our political education, this was one of the things that the Black Panther Party emphasized. So you see, we call it Panther porn. This is Panther porn for us. Panther porn for us is when you see the guns and you know the Berettas and the mugging, that’s Panther porn. What we identified with is the free breakfast program where we fed our kids. We tried to promote the hospital, we tried to promote where we was taking and giving sickle cell anemia tests to our people because we knew they wasn’t doing that. You know, we used to give them free breakfast program. We was getting our food, we had clothes, we was transporting prisoners, families to prisons in California. All out of the way prisons. We was holding political education classes in community and networking with people around their needs and making sure they understood exactly what was going on with them.\n\nOne of the questions I seen that was on the question is the difference between abolition as it relates to prison and the police. And we know we had this call for divest, and I’m going be perfectly honest with you. I don’t want to live in a society that there ain’t no law and order. That’s just not me. I don’t want to live in a society where we don’t feel safe. So it’s not an issue of whether or not police should be in the community. It’s an issue of what’s their relationship? They got on their car serve and protect. Okay, if you’re responsible for serving and protecting me, then my interest should be first and foremost and I shouldn’t be targeted. I shouldn’t be like back in the sixties, everybody that had long hair that was white, they was hippies and you was treated a certain way because in their mind you was anti-sociable or anti-establishment. That’s what made you a hippie. It didn’t make you a hippie because you didn’t… Your identity was based on, I don’t really have a lot of interest in the establishment.\n\nBut they looked at it as a threat. People had afros, they looked at it as a threat. So when we look at it’s not about abolishing the police, it’s about the police respecting the community and the community having more control over. So if you represent me in my community, then you need to be in my community, understand what’s going on in my community and serving my community according to serve and protect.\n\nAbolition on the other hand is we’re about completely abolishing the prison system. What would that look like? And we was having this conversation, what do that look like? You going to open the doors up and let everybody out? I’ve been in prison 48 years. There’s some people that I’ve been around in prison, if I see him on the street the day after tomorrow, I might go call the police on them because I know that’s how their thinking is. But at the same token, if a civil society, we have an obligation to help people. And that’s what we should be doing.\n\nYou know, people have been traumatized and trauma becoming vogue now. You know everybody like oh, trauma experience. So trauma becoming vogue, but people have been traumatized and have not been treated for their trauma. So they dial down on it and that become the norm. So we need to be in a society where we’re healing people. And that’s what I would say when it comes to the abolition. Yeah, we should abolish prison as they exist now, they’re cruel, they’re inhumane. We’ve got the guards in Rikers Island talking about protesting and walkout, wildcat strike because they saying that the elimination of solitary confinement is a threat to them. How is it a threat to you that you put me in a cell for three years on end, bringing my mail to me and say that if you eliminate this right here, me as a worker, it’s going to be threatened by that non-existence. How’s that? That don’t even make sense.\n\nBut this is the attitude that you have when it comes to the prison industrial complex. The prison industrial complex is very profitable. The prison industrial complex became like an industry in and of itself. Every aspect of it has been privatized. The telephone’s been privatized, the medical’s been privatized, the clothing been privatized. So you’ve got a private entity saying, “I’ll make all the clothes for the prisons.” You got another private entity saying, “I’ll take, I want the telephone contract for all the prisons.” You got another company saying, “I want to be responsible for making the beds, the metal and all that.”\n\nWhich leads me to Maryland Correction Enterprise. Maryland Correction Enterprise is one of the entities that does this. There’s a private corporation that has preferential bidding rights on anything that’s being done in Maryland. I’m not going to say these chairs, but I’m going to say any of them tags that’s on your car, that’s Maryland Enterprise. I press tags. So I know that to be a fact. A lot of the desks in your classroom come from Maryland Correction Enterprise.\n\nSo what they’re giving us, they gave us 90 cent a day and you get a bonus. Now, you get the bonus based on how much you produce. So everybody like, so now you’re trying to get… Okay, I’m trying to get like $90 a month. I’m just starting. So somebody that’s been there for a while might be getting $2 a day and some. We pressing tags like till your elbows was on fire because you’re trying to make as much money as you possibly can. You’re trying to produce as many tags as you possibly can to make money.\n\nWell, they’re getting billions, they’re getting millions of dollars from the labor. So I just recently did an interview with a state senator about that because he had put a bill in and I was asking him about it. And then I asked him, I said, “Okay, prisoners going to want to work.” The incentive for prisoners to work is in the Maryland prison system, you get five days off your sentence when you come through the door. Then if you get a job, then some jobs give you 10 days off, so that’s 10 days less that you do in a month. Everybody trying to get in them kind of jobs where you getting less days. So it’s not a matter I don’t want to work and it’s not a matter I like the work that I’m doing. I’m just, the incentive for me to work is really the reduction in my time in prison.\n\nSo I asked the state senator, I said, “Listen,” I said, “Would it be better if, okay, everybody going to want to work, wouldn’t it be better if you pass and try to get a bill passed that say that everybody get minimum wage, that they’d be able to pay their social security, they’d be able to pay taxes and they’d be able to acquire some money. Wouldn’t that be the better approach? Because prisoners going to work.” So I realized when I was having this conversation with them. In Kansas, that’s exactly what they’re doing in Kansas prison. They got guys that’s in Kansas prison saved up to $75,000. They got long-term, they’re not going anywhere, but they’ve been able to have an impact on their family and have a sense of responsibility.\n\nSo another question that came up was, that I was thinking about is what would be y’all response? What would I say to y’all in terms of what I think that y’all should be looking at? And I’m not here to lecture you, but this is for when we look at colleges and as they relate to the struggle, the majority of people that resisted in the seventies, sixties, they came out of school, they came out of college. You had Angela Davis, you had Huey Newton, Bobby Seales, they came out, they was in college, the Kent State, this was a college., they got rid of Angela Davis because she was teaching on campus, because of her politics.\n\nSo college has always been a place where you have a propensity to like being organized or start questioning things and start developing ideas about looking at what’s going on in society today in the country and around the world. We’re in a time right now where, I don’t know how many of y’all read George Orwell 1984, but we’re in like a George Orwellian type of society. And free speech, yeah, it’s only if you talk about a subject matter that is not contrary to capitalism. And then you got the right to free speech, but then you don’t have the right to be heard. So then you got who got control of the media.\n\nSo right now getting our voice out or taking a position and you take a position, oh you being anti, so therefore I’m going to take your grant or I’m going to take your scholarship. I only got like one more semester to graduate. Hey so what? And I’m going to blackball you or better still, I’m going to snowball you and put you in an environment where you ain’t going to be able to get a job at McDonald’s. Why? Because I’m trying to control your thinking and make sure that you don’t be organizing in a manner that’s going to be against anything that we’re doing.\n\nWe’re getting a lot of information coming out and a lot of people is like hysterical. “Oh my god, I don’t know what I’m going to do.” No, this is what you do, you organize. We don’t have the luxury of saying what somebody else is doing going to dictate me not doing nothing. We should be in the mindset that regardless of what you’re doing, I have a right. This is what they say to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I have a right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. I have a right if I want to be transgender, I have a right. I have a right to that. Your morality is not going to determine what I do with myself.\n\nWe were just getting ready to do a thing on transgender prisoners. They didn’t have their biology changed. Your biology changed. According to law. You went to court and got an operation. They took you out of a female prison and put you in a male prison because they say that biology aside, you was born a male, not what you are now. And rounded them up and took them to a male prison. Who does this? Who had the right to tell you that you come from another country to come here for a better life? Oh by the way, everybody in Congress, ancestors came here for a better life. So I know they should have no issue with that because they wouldn’t be where they are right now if the Statue of Liberty would say hell no. So we passed that.\n\nBut everybody, I ain’t talking about the people that they brought here, the people that was here before them, the indigenous people who said, “Hey, everybody get the hell out. Because this is our…” No. What you want to say that you create this false narrative that people of color from another country is creating all the crime in this country, therefore we’re going to round you all up. Kind of sound like something they did with the Japanese when they put them in internment camps, right? When they say like, these are people that was fighting for this country. These are United States citizens that were fighting in this country. They rounded them up, put them in internment camps because you’re Japanese and we fighting Japan. So your loyalty can’t be with us. Your loyalty got to be with them, or we just don’t care one way or the other.\n\nIt sounds like kind of like that. But the point I’m making is we don’t have the luxury to sit back and allow the hysteria that’s going on in this country around some fools to make us say, I’m not going to do nothing, or get into a position where I’m just, I don’t know what to do, I’m giving up. No. Resistance is possible. It starts with education, it starts with political education. It starts with understanding the history. Lenin said that imperialism is the highest form of capitalism. We’ve seen imperialism, we’ve seen that imperialism taking shape. So a lot of this is based on the capitalist drive for greed. It’s about greed. A lot of this.\n\nWhen you talk about taking a country and say, “Oh, we’re going to take the Gaza and turn it into Disneyland.” And what you going to do with the people? “Hey we already bombed them into oblivion so they’d be glad to work, they’d be glad to put on Donald Duck suits and Mickey Mouse hats and get some money.” That’s your reality. Their reality is, “I just want to live a human life.” That’s my reality. My reality, I just want to live human. I don’t have no problem with nobody. I just want to be human and treated like a human.\n\nBut when you say something like that, “Oh, you anti.” You ain’t got the right to say nothing like that. And if you say it on campus and you try to get them to take a position on campus, their masters who they invest with, corporate America going to tell them, say no. And Congress going to say, “Oh any money we gave you, we’re taking it back.” So the money, monetary is more important than people’s lives. That’s our reality.\n\nSo as we move forward, my message to y’all is don’t settle for mediocrity, don’t settle for nothing less. Whatever you’re thinking that you think should be done, do it. If you think that, but more importantly in doing it, make sure that it’s having impact. When you’re dealing with, like I said, we took that place. We knew that neighborhood, the drug dealers in the neighborhood, this is what they used to say to us when we come through there and say, “Hey, it ain’t a good time to be down here today.” And they give us a warning like, “Y’all can’t come down here today.”\n\nAnd we was good with that because they knew that it was their children that we was creating a safe environment about. They couldn’t get out of the grips of their insanity and we weren’t trying to get them out of it. Our focus was on the community and people. And we feel that if we educate the people enough, if we educate the mothers, the girlfriends, the wives enough to say like, “Y’all deserve to be safe.” The people that’s not making y’all safe is your boyfriend, your father and them. Y’all need to talk to them and tell them that y’all are making our lives unsafe. All we’re doing is educating you that you have a right.\n\nAll we’re doing is coming down there and telling you that we’re doing something with your children. We’re taking your children out of the neighborhood on trips that they’ve never been before. We’re making them feel like they have some value. We’re making them feel like, “Yeah you can get a hug today and there won’t be nothing unusual about it.” This is what we was doing and it had an impact. What they wind up doing with that neighborhood is they did with all of Baltimore, that’s a major, they started tearing down places, boarding up places. So you might be on the block or you might be in the projects and you might live in this house. The next four houses is boarded up, another house, the next two houses boarded up. How can you have a sense of community with all that blight?\n\nThen the trash bins that’s for the area become public trash, and then people just ride by, see a trash bin, throw trash in the area. How can you live in that kind of blight? So when somebody come and say, “I’m going to give you a voucher to move somewhere that you ain’t going to be able to afford in a year,” you’re going to take it on the strength that like you ain’t factored in, I ain’t going to be able to afford it. You say, “I just want to get out of here.” And when they get you out of there, next thing you know they come in and demolish it and they got condominiums and townhouses and it’s affordable housing for somebody that’s making 90, 100,000 dollars a year. But it’s definitely ain’t affordable housing for somebody that’s making less than minimum wage. So that’s my point. And I’m opening the floor for any comments or questions.\n\nI was going to ask what can everyday citizens, meaning not politicians do to help prisoners?\n\nMansa Musa:\n\nOkay, and that’s a good question because one of the things that we had, we had a lot of people from the community come into the institution. But what you can do is educate yourself on some of the issues that’s affecting them. Like right now in Maryland they got what they call the Second Chance Act and they trying to get this bill passed to say that after you did 20 years then you can petition the court for a reduction in sentence. It’s not guaranteed you’re going to get it, but it opens the door for a person to have hope, because after you… when you get first locked up, they give you a designated amount of time to file a petition for modification. After that, it’s over with,. The only thing available to you then is parole. If you don’t make parole then you in there forever and ever and ever.\n\nSo this is a bill that’s being sponsored by people whose family members are locked up and been locked up for a long time. And it’s a good bill because what it do, it create hope. And when you have hope in an environment, it changes the way people think. So when you have a hopeless environment, and case in point the then Governor Glenn Denning came in front of the Jessup Correction Institution in Jessup because a guy was out on work release, had killed his girlfriend and he had life. So he sent all the lifers back, took them all out of camp and put them all back in prison and then stood out in front of the institution to say, “From now on life mean life, let me tell you that ain’t nobody, any of you got a life sentence, you going to die in prison.”\n\nWhen he left that prison, the violence went up like that. I mean stabbings, murders and everything because there was no hope. Because now people saying, “I’m going to be here for the rest of my life so I got to dominate this environment.” When the Unger case came out, bills was passed about juvenile life, they got bills passed. They’re saying if you have drug problem you can get drug treatment and the [inaudible 00:33:05] and people started going. It was whole. So to your question, monitor some of these things and look at some of the websites of the institutions, see what kind of programs they offer. They might need some volunteers to come in help with teaching classes. They might need some volunteers to come in to help with some of the activities they doing that’s helping support prisoners. Thank you.\n\nFirst of all, thank you for coming out and really appreciate it. It’s great to hear you speak. I had a question, you kind of briefly alluded to it already, but how would you compare the political conditions, especially like during Black Power in the sixties and seventies and eighties, and like the repression that everyone faced, like especially from COINTELPRO and FBI and the police to today, and like what students and people on the street are facing right now?\n\nMansa Musa:\n\nI think that back then the difference was technology, the internet, where we get our information from and the AI, that’s becoming vastly like the thing now. I think the difference is like back then, and Huey Newton made this analysis, what he called intercommunalism. He talked about that at some point in time technology will become so advanced that we ain’t going to have no more borders, and which we don’t when it comes to information, right?\n\nSo the difference is that the fascists are more advanced and pluralism is more insidious. Back then, because you had a lot of repression around class, so Black people was being subjected. So you had the war in Vietnam, we had so much going on that it was easy for people to come and find a commonality. Said, “Hey, we live in this squalor here in Little Puerto Rico and New York. We live in this squalor down here in Brooklyn and so and so. We’re living in…” What’s our common thread? Our common thread is that we’re being treated inhuman. So it was easy to come together around organizing around social conditions.\n\nNow because of so much misinformation and so much control, that it’s hard to really get a read on what is real and what’s not real. You had the president say that when they gave everybody an ultimatum to give their report by the end, like a report card or something at the end of the week and they didn’t do it. He said, so when they put the mic in front of his mouth he said, “Oh, the reason why they didn’t do it is because the people that didn’t submit it don’t work there anyway.” So somebody getting a check in their name, in other words fraud was the reason why you got a 100 workers and only 10 people work there so the other 90 don’t exist anyway, so where that money going? That money going to somebody else’s pocket.\n\nBut that was the narrative he painted. But when he painted the narrative, the media is so dim with it that they like, it’s almost like you asking them a question and it’s like, no you’re dumb, no you’re dumb, no you’re dumb, no you’re dumb. And I got a Pulitzer and I’m going back and forth a whole stop. I’m not even going to ask you no more questions. So that’s what we’ve been relegated to. So that’s the difference, but in terms of our response, I’m going to give you an example. When they killed, when them little kids got killed at Sandy Hook Elementary, the children said they going to do something about it. They asked their parents, they went on social media, they started finding everybody had the same attitude. Next thing you know they had 40,000 kids that say they going to Washington.\n\nSo now I’m telling my mother, “I’m going to Washington, whether you going with me or not.” So the parents say, “Oh we’re going to chaperone you.” That’s how quick they organize. So that’s the difference. Our ability to organize is a lot fast, it’s a lot quicker now. So we can organize a lot quicker if we come to a consensus on what we’re trying to get done. And our response can be a response of like hysteria. We got to be focused. You know, we got to really sit back and say, they’re going to do what they’re doing. You know? They’re going to do what they’re doing. So if I’m doing around workers, I got every federal worker, I’m getting with every federal worker, I’m organized. I’m not going to sit back and say, “Oh well look…” No. Organized.\n\nYou know you got a right, organize, get together, organize, bump Congress, bump, bump, filing lawsuits, bump them doing whatever they’re doing. They the problem. Get organized and say, “Okay we’re going to organize, we’re going to mobilize. We got midterms coming up, we getting in your ass. In the next presidential election, you don’t have to worry about the count, we ain’t going to give one vote. That’s going to be your vote.” That’s what you do, organize. Well don’t, we get caught up in this thing like with Trump, I don’t have no problem with him. He is what he is. My problem is making sure that I tell people and organize people and help people get some type of sense of security.\n\nSo we should be food building co-ops, food co-ops. Because $99 for a dozen eggs? No, we should be building a food co-op. We should be doing things where we really looking to each other to start a network. And on campus, we should be looking at how are we going to take and organize ourselves into a block where once we decide an issue then all we’re going to be forced to deal with that issue and try to make a difference.\n\nSee some fights is not a fight worth taking because all it’s going to do is cause a loss. So you got to be strategic in your fight. We put a 10-point platform program together for the reason of identifying the social conditions that existed in society as it related for oppressed people. We chose to police the police because that was the number one issue that was affecting people. But our main thing was feeding our children, medical, housing, and education. Those were the main things we did. So we took over education institutions. That was our main thing. Our main thing wasn’t walking around with shotguns and guns. Those was things that we did to protect the community, but our main focus was programs that directly related to serving people’s needs.\n\nThank you. Thank you.\n\nMansa Musa:\n\nYou’re welcome.\n\nHi, I do have a question. First of all, I want to say great job, amazing conversation and the topics are so important. So I guess my question to you is how do… you mentioned this, like how do college students on campus build morale and boost momentum? Because I know it can kind of be a little iffy and hard to do so, especially if you have that backside fear of like this could cost me my entire like college education and the future I was wishing to build for myself?\n\nMansa Musa:\n\nRight, and see and that’s not something that shouldn’t be taken into account. I invested in this, you know, and I invested in for a reason. I spent money. This money, my parents put in. They ain’t going to be sitting back like, “What? You did what? All that money going down the drain? Nah, that ain’t happening.” But the reality is this here, you mobilize around educating yourself, raising your consciousness and understanding historical conditions like Kent State, what college students did back then. Vietnam War and groups like this, young Democrats, socialists of America come to create political education classes, bring in speakers much like myself.\n\nWe pass around literature of books, videos, and look at those things and develop a space for y’all coming together to talk and discuss, how that’s going to come a direction. And look at issues off the campus. Look at issues like if it’s around in this area right here, how many homeless people exist? How much property do the campus, do the school own? All right, I ain’t telling you, I ain’t going to say like don’t mess with them over in the Middle East because that’s wrong. No, I’m going to say, “Oh, damn, you know what, y’all got all this land and property and within this radius you got like homeless people sleeping on the ground. We asking that you take some of this property and turn it into homeless shelter, and in the name of Ms. Snyder or give it a name of somebody. We asking, now now we’re moving in the area, we’re asking that you take this money and feed some people.\n\nNow in this area, now we’re talking about that. We’re taking that you dig in this area and you help people that can’t, don’t have medical insurance but need certain things that you can get done, like dental. We’re asking that you take this money and putting it… This is things that free dental health. So you can take and say, “We providing free medical assistance at this level. We tested people for sickle cell, we tested people for HIV.”\n\nWhen Huey and them decided to do the Black Panther Party, they looked at Malcolm and they picked up where Malcolm left off at. That’s how they got in the space that they got. They just took the social conditions said that these are areas you need to focus on, because you got what they call objective and subjective conditions. Objective conditions is what you see every day. The subjective conditions is what we do, how we organize, how we develop ourselves, what we’re doing. Because that’s going to determine how effective we going to be when we go out. So if we can’t come to no consensus on direction then we ain’t going to be effective when we go out. Because somebody going to be saying do this and somebody going to be saying do that, but that ain’t going to be the problem. Problem going to be I don’t like what you doing. So now you my enemy.\n\nSo I think one of the questions was actually about Maryland Correctional Enterprise. So we could talk about that. Yeah. In response to student concerns about Maryland Correctional Enterprises, President Pines said students concerns is that inmates are underpaid. That’s out of our control and we have to abide by state law. But the other side of the story is that the inmates actually want the employment because it gives them skills. How do we combat this messaging?\n\nMansa Musa:\n\nAll right, so the basic thing, and somebody asked earlier, what can you do? It’s legislation because the argument is why can’t you give them minimum wage? So when we tried to unionize back in the seventies and it’s a celebrity case, North Carolina versus somebody, we tried to unionize, they said no. And the reason why they said no because then you talking about the whole prison in the United States of America, [inaudible 00:44:30] you got 2.9 million people there in prison or better. So you’re saying we in the union, we got the largest union in the country.\n\nSo the issue is legislation and advocating for them prisoners to get minimum wage, a livable wage, no matter how much time you got. That allowed for MCE, we’re not opposed to them making money, we’re opposed to them profiting off of us and we’re not getting the benefit of it. So the issue is if I left out of prison and I had my quarter paid into social security, I had my quarters three times over. Now I’m forced to work. I got to work at least three more years or more before I get my quarter. Because when I left the street, I ain’t worked like maybe three years on it all.\n\nBut if a person got their quarter while they in, they get minimum wage or they allowed to save money, they can make a contribution to their family. A lot of guys got locked up, they got children, they could do something for their children. They got their mother, their families travel long distances to see them. They could pay for that transportation. The phone calls, they could pay for the phone calls. So they’d be able to take a burden off their family.\n\nIt don’t cost MCE nothing. They got preferential treatment and contract for all state institutions. Any institution that’s in state under the state of Maryland, they can do them. Whatever they make, clothes, the chemicals, signs, signs you see up and down there. They do all that. Tags, all the furniture. All the furniture you see in the state cabinet, all that. They do all that. So yeah, they could do that. That’s the alternative is for the legislator to pass a bill that says that prisoners can get minimum wage from any industry, any prison industry. If you hired in the prison industry, then you should be given minimum wage. And they got meat cutting, they do the meats, they do the furniture, they do the laundry for like different hospitals, and they do them tags. Them tags, I’m telling you, that was like… I really realized how people felt on the plantation doing them tags. That was like some… Yeah. That was labor.\n\nThis isn’t on the responses but this is like one of the questions that we’ve thought about. In your previous podcast episode, you interviewed the state senator and he mentioned the 13th Amendment and the connection between prison labor and slavery. So what do you think are some of the connections between the prison abolition movement and like the historical movement for the abolition of slavery?\n\nMansa Musa:\n\nRight now, you know the 13th Amendment says that slavery is illegal except for involuntary servitude if you’re duly convicted of a crime. So if you’re duly convicted of a crime, you can be treated as a slave. And the difference between that and the abolition movement back in the historical was the justification. The justification for it now is you’ve been convicted of a crime. Back then, I just kidnapped and brought you here and made you work. So the disconnect was this is a human, you taking people and turning them into chattel slaves. Versus, oh the reason why I can work you from sun up to sundown, you committed a crime. But the reality is you put that in there so that you could have free labor.\n\nAll that is a Jim Crow law, Black code. It’s the same. It’s the same in and of itself. It’s not no different. You work me in the system. In some states they don’t even pay you at all. South Carolina, they don’t even pay you. But they work you. In Louisiana, they still walk, they got police, they got the guards on horses with shotguns and they out there in the fields. In some places in North Carolina and Alabama, Alabama they work you in some of the most inhumane conditions like freezers, women and men, put you to work you in a meat plant in the freezer and don’t give you the proper gear to be warm enough to do the work.\n\nAnd then if you complain, because they use coercion, say “Okay, you don’t want to work? We’ll take the job from you, transfer you to a prison where now you’re going to have to fight your way out. You going to literally have to go in there, get a knife and defend yourself. So this is your choice. Go ahead, work in this inhumane conditions or say no and go somewhere and be sent back to a maximum security prison where you have to fight your way out.” So now it’s no different. Only difference is it’s been legislated, it’s been legalized under the 13th Amendment.\n\nAnd abolition, in response to abolition, so we’ve been trying to change the 13th Amendment. We had an attempt in California where they put a bill out to try to get it reversed, and the state went against it. The state was opposed to it. Because why would I want to stop having free labor? The firefighters in California, they do the same work that the firefighters right beside them, they do the same work, the same identical work. They fighting fire, their lives are in danger. They’re getting like 90 cent a day, maybe $90 a month. They don’t have no 401k, they don’t have no retirement plan, and they’re being treated like everybody else, go out there and fight the fire.\n\nSo yeah, in terms of abolition, the abolition movement is to try to change the narrative and get the 13th Amendment taken off, out of state constitutions because a lot of states, they adopted it. They adopted it in their own state constitution, a version of the 13th Amendment that says that except if you’ve been duly convicted for a crime, you can be treated as a slave. If you’ve been convicted of a crime, you can be treated as a slave. That’s basically the bottom line of it. Thank you.\n\nSo like, I saw two questions kind of talking about state repression and like attempts to divide solidarity movements. So how do you kind of feel like state repression has changed over the decades and how can we kind of respond to those situations?\n\nMansa Musa:\n\nThe thing with state repression now is it’s a little bit more insidious. It’s not as overt like it was back in the sixties when they crossed the Edmund Bridge and they beat them, put dogs on them, or like they just took a move in Philadelphia, they burned the house down, burned the whole block down. There’s one house right here we got a problem with, oh hey, you had no business living in that neighborhood. We burned the whole neighborhood down, dropped a bomb on it. Or like they went to in California and they shot the headquarters of the Black Panther Party up. Or they ran down and killed Fred Hampton, drugged him and then came in there and shot him. His wife was in the bed with him. They put like 90 holes in him and not one on her. So you already knew you had the diagram where he sleep at, you knew he was drugged because the agent provocateur spiked his milk. So he was drugged, he was knocked out. And you came in there and killed him and said, “Oh, he fired out the window.”\n\nSo the difference is now because of the media and the propaganda, you have a different slant on things, and the fear of corporate America in terms of perpetuating this fear. So you change the narrative. You can’t say certain things. You can’t. If you say certain things about certain people or certain countries, you’re going to be Blackballed, labeled. And the pressure going to come in the form of okay, you don’t care. Okay, I’m going to attack your family. I’m going to find somewhere in the scenario where I can get you to back up. If that don’t work, then I’m going to round your ass up and send you to Guantanamo Bay. I can make up something. We got the illegal combatants. You got people that’s been in Guantanamo Bay since the Gulf War and has not been sent nowhere, had not been, no due process, no where are my accusers. Oh you’ve been labeled illegal combatant, state sponsored terrorism.\n\nSo they got so many different things they can say to make it where as though it seems to be an issue of you resisting and your right to protest and demonstration. It becomes you’re a threat to society or you’re a threat to the government. And this is how we’re saying it. We’re saying that, oh you was on the internet with somebody that’s been branded a terrorist. And that become enough to get them to say, “All right, lock them up.”\n\nSo now the difference is when they had COINTELPRO, COINTELPRO they was doing all these things and setting people up and killing them. But we knew what was going on and we made people aware of it. Now all this misinformation, it’s hard to get a read on what’s going on. So the response got to be, again, we got to organize ourselves, develop our own information source and all the misinformation, be prepared to identify it and put it in perspective. This is misinformation. And start educating people on understanding that be mindful where you’re getting your information from. We’re addicted to social media. We’re addicted to being like, how many likes I get today? Hey, they don’t like me. Oh my God, I’m having a fit. No, I don’t care if you don’t like me because if they lock you up and send you to another country, you ain’t want to be liked by nobody. I don’t know.\n\nIn terms of supporting countries and movements that’s fighting for their liberation in the Congo, in the hemisphere, South America, then yeah, we support a person’s right to self-determination. For us, our position right now should be to educate ourselves, politically educate ourselves to understanding social, economic, political conditions and the relationship they have between us and people. Because people going to resist. People going to be hungry, they’re going to go to stores and take whatever the hell they want to take because they don’t have nothing to eat. That’s just the reality. They ain’t got nothing to do with, I have a propensity to steal. No, I don’t have the ability to pay to feed my children.\n\nVersus somebody that had ability. Food is high. And then medical, they talking about the Medicaid and all that. So if they take that and poor people rely on that, how you going to get the medical treatment that you need? How you going to get the medicine that you need? So these are the areas that, this is when you’re talking about organizing people, you got to look at what they’re doing, what the repression is, how they trying to repress people and organize around the counter to that. What’s the counter to this? What’s the counter to the medical? Do y’all have medical students here? What are their attitudes towards providing services for people?\n\nWhat’s the problem with mental health? Do y’all have mental health people here that’s in that field? Social workers in that field? Then your responsibility is come and get them to say, “Listen, we need you to go in the community to organize, to help us organize this. Show us how to organize this for the community to get them to be more proactive.” Okay, what’s your purpose of your education? The purpose of my education, I want to get a degree and make some money. Okay, and what? The federal government? What’s your chances of getting a job in the federal government?\n\nThey find people that’s on probation, person that got 20 years in one job, get a better job and they put them on probation. They say, “Oh you fired because you’re on probation.” No, I just took a better job. But the arbitrariness of this thinking is that I’m putting fear and I’m turning people into snitches because I’m making you, in order to keep what you got, you got to tell on somebody as opposed to us saying, take the institution of higher learning and look at the different departments and see how you can go into new departments and get them to become more proactive in doing some things in the community.\n\nAnd that’s the whole thing about the higher learning. Look at these other disciplines and start asking yourself, how can I get them to start doing some things in the community to help raise people’s consciousness? How can we come together to do a plan, a program around how we can invest in the community? How can we get a plan to start dealing with getting trauma to be recognized as a national mental health and get the government to do what they supposed to do in terms of providing services for people that’s been traumatized. And stop, oh, oh yeah, you traumatized but you shouldn’t have did what you did. But you’re saying that trauma, I’m in trauma, that’s why I’m doing what I’m doing. Yeah, but we don’t recognize that because you did it. All we recognize as a problem, we’re not recognizing as it relate to you. Double talk.\n\nI had a question about the role of electoralism, because one part of the Black Panther Party’s historical activism that’s somewhat forgotten is elections and campaigns like Bobby Seale ran for mayor of Oakland. A lot of the modern American left is starting to be more wary of the use of elections because we’ve seen people who maybe are supposed to represent our values get elected, and then do things against what their constituents want, things like that. But I was wondering if you had any thoughts about if there’s still a role for elections to, you know, be agitational and grow the organization, or you know, how we can make sure that we’re still, you know, being agitational against the establishment.\n\nMansa Musa:\n\nAnd you know, Tip O’Neill said, “All politics are local.” And Tip O’Neill was the speaker of the House, the Democrat party back in caveman days. But my position, and to reflect on what you said about Bobby Seale, when the party took that position of running Bobby Seale for mayor, we knew that he wasn’t going to get elected. But the objective was, this was the ability to mobilize people around, educating them around what this government, what the city government is supposed to do, what your government is supposed to do. So now we are on the campaign trail saying, “No, the budget is the people’s budget. The money is the people’s money. The budget got to be like this. If I’m elected, I’m going to do this,” and make him respond to it.\n\nBut then at the same token we looked at, when we started doing that, I was telling [inaudible 01:01:59], we started looking at local elections. Our institution of elected. Ericka Huggins, who was a member of the Black Panther Party, she ran for the position to be the director of the Juvenile Services. And when she got in that position, she changed the whole narrative of how they treated the kids. So that was one way we got in there and changed policy.\n\nWhat we recognize though, that in terms of electoral system, there’s no such thing as two parties. It’s one party, the capitalist party. That’s it, that’s all. They knew that this is reality, this is the reality we confronted with. If you know Biden ain’t going to be able to cut the mustard for two years, just hypothetical, you know he ain’t going to cut the mustard for two years. Why you didn’t in two years at the end there say, “Listen, the Democrat Party that’s responsible for putting all the money up, let’s start getting a candidate now. We’re going to have open primaries, whoever come out there.”\n\nNo, you put Kamala Harris, the top cop in this position and expected, one, they’re going to put a woman in there. Hillary Clinton was more qualified and more fascist than all of them put together. And they ain’t put her in there more qualified. She’s secretary of state, senator, her husband, Obama, Biden, Trump, Bush one, two, and three. More qualified than all of them. They definitely wasn’t putting her in there. And then they’re going to turn around and put Kamala Harris in there. That wasn’t happening.\n\nSo what you did, so it ain’t made no difference. Trump, they got somebody come on. I don’t know if it’s AI generated or not where he’s saying that he stole the election. That yeah, Elon Musk knew how to work the computers, so that’s why I won Pennsylvania. All right. What we did on that? Ain’t nobody in their right mind think they won’t let this woman get in there. And this is a two-party system and then y’all at the 11th hour, y’all got to… So now you’re putting the pressure on everybody donate, donate. And her position was, “Look what you want to do? What you want to do? So I’m going to do something but my thing is, I’m telling y’all don’t, I’m here. This your alternate. Vote for me, don’t vote for him.”\n\nWhy? “Because y’all going to… Look at him.” Yeah. It wasn’t like what I’m offering y’all, what am I offering y’all? How am I changing? Food was still high, gas was high. People’s everyday needs. And he, look, he did a whole bunch of crazy fire too but he played, he ran on that. Oh, he ran on that record. Oh look, y’all can’t put gas in y’all cars? Y’all can’t put food on your table? Oh man, y’all ain’t safe? Yeah, we wasn’t safe when you was in there, we didn’t have food on our table when you was in there. But you saying, “Look. Oh yeah, but look. Forget what I did. Look what they’re doing to y’all now.” Yeah. Come on.\n\nSo in turn, in response to I look at the electoral politics like this here, certain municipalities that you can make impact policy, that you can organize people and put people in there that’s going to be responsible to that. Yeah. But when you look at Congress and they beholding to corporations, they beholding to them. You ain’t going to find a Ron Dellums. You ain’t going to find a Clayton Powell. You ain’t going to find these people like this here, Shirley Chisholm, Fannie Lou Hamer. You ain’t going to find these people that’s like, I’m here, I’m here as a representative of the people.\n\nRon Dellums and he was a member of this right here. Ron Dellums was the first one that had congressional hearings about what they were doing to the Black Panther Party. This was when he was in the office and Hoover was in power. And so everybody was scared of Hoover, but Ron Dellums wasn’t scared of him. So when you look at the electoral politics, we got to take the position of Malcolm too. Malcolm said that we’re going to register as independents, we’re going to put our agenda together. You sign onto our agenda. If you don’t represent what you say you’re going to represent, then we’re going to be calling you. The same way we got you in, the same way we’re going to get you out. And make them sign on to that.\n\nAll right. Thank you. I appreciate it. And I got some stuff over here on Eddie Conway. I got my card over there. We can take a picture of the QR code, Rattling The Bars, real news. Appreciate this, appreciate this opportunity. My call to action for y’all is, you know, just go out, sit back, get together, start brainstorming, look at some of these institutions. How can I get… That’s where you go at, go to these bodies of work, psychology, go to these bodies of work. What are you doing? What’s your position on trauma? Oh, this is my position on trauma. All right, will you be willing to do a trauma workshop in a Black community, in a neighborhood where they traumatized? Would you be willing to help set that up?\n\nThen go out there and find a community where they’re traumatized. Get somebody to say, “Look, hey, we want to come down here and educate y’all on trauma, but more importantly, we want to get the other part of this institution that we have that’s doing wellness to get them to create a wellness program for y’all to do it and make the institution pay for it.” Yeah, you ain’t got to tell them don’t invest in somebody. Say, “Look, invest in this.”","summary":"At a lecture for UMD College Park's YDSA, the host of Rattling the Bars spoke about his 48 years behind bars, and how the political struggle has evolved over his half-century of experience.","url":"https://therealnews.com/former-black-panther-mansa-musa-on-how-to-fight-trump","image":"https://therealnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-07-at-10.15.36-AM-1-e1744043003687.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 16:55:16","author":"Mansa Musa","authors":["Mansa Musa"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.076},{"id":308711442,"title":"PA's Democrat Governor Josh Shapiro Ripped for 'Betraying' Children over School Choice While Eyeing Presidency","text":"Pennsylvania’s Democrat governor is being criticized for not keeping his campaign promises when it comes to school choice.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro recently talked about a potential 2028 presidential bid during an interview on HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, but some are unhappy with how he has handled the issue of his states’ young students and their opportunities to grow academically.\n\nIn a Friday opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), Rachel Langan highlighted the fact Shapiro had promised to pass a scholarship program to assist young scholars in struggling neighborhoods who want to be able to afford the school of their choice.\n\nHowever, Langan argued Shapiro appears willing to leave those students and schools behind in his possible bid for the presidency.\n\nThe article continued:\n\nWhile campaigning in 2022, Mr. Shapiro promised to pass Lifeline Scholarships. The scholarships would give low-income children in failing public schools between $5,000 and $10,000 to pay for safe and high-quality private schools. In these failing public schools, only 10% of students are proficient in math, and only 33% are proficient in English. In Hazleton, six of the seven public schools are failing academically, with the last one not far behind.\nBut Mr. Shapiro still hasn’t signed Lifeline Scholarships into law. While the Republican-controlled state Senate is on board, the leaders of the narrowly held Democratic majority in the House have balked. As the leader of their party and the state’s chief executive, Mr. Shapiro could use his bully pulpit to pressure his fellow Democrats. Instead, he has caved at the first sign of disagreement. Despite continuing to mention the scholarships, including calling them “unfinished business” in 2024, the governor hasn’t lifted a finger to keep the promise that helped sweep him into the state’s highest office.\n\nIn February, the Williamsport Sun-Gazette reported Shapiro proposed an additional $526 million in funding for public schools.\n\nIn a social media post on Sunday, Republican strategist Andrew Surabian blasted the governor over the school choice issue highlighted in Langan’s piece.\n\n“Josh Shapiro campaigning on commonsense school choice policies and then getting elected and immediately bending the knee to the leftwing teachers union is incredibly on brand for today’s Democrat party. Even the supposed ‘moderates’ are controlled by the extreme left,” he wrote:\n\nConservative communicator Steve Guest also commented on Langan’s article, writing, “Josh Shapiro’s 2028 campaign is off to a rough start.”\n\nShapiro, who in 2023 cut millions in taxpayer funds to a pro-life program that supported counseling and housing for pregnant women, was the person whom now former Vice President Kamala Harris (D) rejected as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election, as Breitbart News reported.","summary":"Pennsylvania's Democrat governor is being criticized for not keeping his campaign promises when it comes to school choice.\n\n\nThe post PA&#8217;s Democrat Governor Josh Shapiro Ripped for &#8216;Betraying&#8217; Children over School Choice While Eyeing Presidency appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/education/2025/04/07/pas-democrat-gov-josh-shapiro-ripped-for-betraying-children-over-school-choice-while-eyeing-presidency/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/04/Josh-Shapiro-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 16:18:55","author":"Amy Furr","authors":["Amy Furr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":308708886,"title":"Black America is Divided on Whether it Was OK to Sit out the April 5 Protests","text":"Millions of people sent a message to President Donald Trump and Elon Musk on April 5 as part of the Hands Off! Day of Action organized in opposition to the policies of the Trump administration, including sweeping tariffs and massive cuts to federal agencies. According to reporting from CNN, over 1,400 “Hands Off!” protests events took place at state capitals, federal buildings and other locations around the country.\n\nBut while we’ve seen stunning images of crowds in places like Washington, D.C., New York City, Cincinnati, Ohio and Phoenix one segment of the population seemed to be visibly missing from all of the pictures and video – Black folks. \n\nWhen news of the day of protests was announced, Black people sent a resounding message to organizers saying that after showing up to vote for Kamala Harris in the November 2024 election, they were obeying the call of the ancestors to sit this one out. And as they watched from their windows and their couches, most seemed to be ok with not being a part of the action and content with letting others (read: white people) pick up the slack.\n\n“Our people did good 🖤🖤 I’m so proud of us. Blk people do stand together,” wrote one commenter on a TikTok video of protest footage from around the country.\n\nOthers pointed out that because there were so few Black and Brown people at events around the country, the police had no reason to see the protesters as a threat.\n\n“Notice how since we’re not out there the police have been “hands off”?” wrote someone else.\n\nBut there was also another contingent of Black people who argued that this is no time to sit down.\n\nTikToker @princesslela95 posted a video where she appears to be checking for Black people at the protest who didn’t understand the assignment to use Saturday as a day of rest. \n\nCommenters clapped back that Black people should be present to protest for those who can’t speak for themselves. \n\n“As black people, we SHOULD be at these protests. we did our part but some DIDNT. 89 million people didnt vote because some COULDNT. do it for the people who cant because we CAN,” wrote someone in the comments.\n\nOthers agreed, arguing that we have to be our own voice because no one else is coming to save us. \n\n“We can’t be complicit the only ppl who can liberate black ppl is ourselves.

So far, more than $6.6 trillion in market value has been lost and there are signs that the markets will be more negative in the days and weeks ahead. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, Nasdaq composite, and S&P 500 indexes are all down and the rest of the global economic system is being dragged down as well.\n\nBy contrast, Trump—the architect of the problem—says that everything is okay.\n\n“The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don’t be Weak! Don’t be Stupid! Don’t be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!” Trump wrote on his Truth Social account on Monday morning.\n\nBefore that, he claimed (without evidence) that his tariffs are “bringing in billions” and said in remarks to reporters on Sunday that he has been in contact with world leaders and they “are dying to make a deal.”\n\nBut world leaders have slammed Trump’s tariff actions and many of the leading economic powers—the European Union and multiple Asian nations including China—have responded with tariffs of their own.\n\nSeveral of the billionaires who backed Trump’s most recent presidential campaign are now publicly freaking out about what he has done to the markets.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman wrote on Sunday that Trump’s “massive and disproportionate tariffs” had launched “a global economic war against the whole world at once.”\n\nAckman called on Trump to declare a 90-day “time out” or else “we are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down.”\n\nAckman endorsed Trump in 2024, arguing that he trusted Trump to deal with immigration and antisemitism. Ackman has not loudly complained about Trump’s policies abducting migrants, destroying government departments, or erasing history—but is now vocal now that the markets are affected.\n\nTrump’s most visible billionaire backer, Elon Musk, also voiced some concerns over the tariffs. In comments before a far-right Italian political party on Saturday, Musk said he wanted the U.S. and Europe to be in “a zero-tariff situation.” The opinion is a direct contradiction with Trump, who has inaccurately argued for years that tariffs can be used to grow American success.\n\nMusk also posted a message to his social media network X, criticizing Trump economic adviser Peter Navarro, who is one of the major forces behind Trump’s tariff policy.\n\nOn the media front, one of Trump’s strongest allies, Fox Business anchor (and conspiracy theorist) Maria Bartiromo labeled the tariff issue a “debacle” during her Monday show.\n\nThere are more alarm bells ringing from the wealthy elite.\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, who has backed Democrats in the past, was an early defender of Trump on tariffs. In January, he defended impending Trump tariffs, telling a wealthy audience at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland, “I would put in perspective: If it’s a little inflationary, but it’s good for national security, so be it. I mean, get over it.”\n\nNow he has also changed his tune. In his annual shareholder letter released Monday, Dimon said the tariffs would likely lead to “inflationary outcomes.”\n\nTrump’s team has nonetheless tried to spin the bad situation. Appearing next to screens and screens of red-colored text forecasting another down day in the markets, Navarro appeared on CNBC on Monday and said the tariffs were “a beautiful situation.”\n\nThere were warnings that Trump’s policies would be a mess, leading to increased costs on basic goods and even leisure items, like video and board games.\n\n“You don't just throw around the idea of just tariffs across the board, and that's part of the problem with Donald Trump,” former Vice President Kamala Harris said in September 2024.\n\n“I say this in all sincerity, he's just not very serious about how he thinks about some of these issues. And one must be serious and have a plan, and a real plan that's not just about some talking point ending in an exclamation at a political rally, but actually putting the thought into what will be the return on the investment, what will be the economic impact on everyday people.”","summary":"President Donald Trump’s tariff policies are roiling global markets and the U.S. economy, and now his billionaire backers are up in arms about it.\n\n\n\nTrump’s decision to unilaterally levy new tariffs across dozens of countries has triggered days of Wall Street sell-offs.

Several Senate Democrats continue bending the knee to Trump, helping him ram through abysmal Cabinet picks and advance his destructive agenda. The frustration has reached a boiling point—so much so that new polling shows a majority of voters in one key Democratic stronghold are ready to turn the page and hand the reins to a new generation.\n\nA new poll from the liberal group Data for Progress, released Friday, has progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trouncing Schumer in a hypothetical 2028 Senate primary in New York—leading him 55% to 36% among likely Democratic primary voters. Nine percent said they were unsure.\n\nIt’s only one poll, yes, but the takeaway is clear: Schumer is not the untouchable force he believes himself to be. Democratic voters are hungry for someone younger, bolder, and far less inclined to roll over for Trump.\n\n“This poll really does show that Democrats are united in just wanting to stand up, wanting to fight, wanting to see someone taking a stand for them,” said Danielle Deiseroth, executive director of Data for Progress, in an interview with Politico.\n\nAnd that wasn’t even the worst of it for Schumer, who canceled his book tour in March after widespread backlash over his vote to help Republicans pass Trump’s budget. The same poll found Schumer with one of the weakest favorability ratings among Democrats tested—just +26. Compare that with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders at +69, former Vice President Kamala Harris at +63, and Ocasio-Cortez close behind with a strong +59. \n\nWhile Schumer hides from the spotlight, Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders have been front and center, making the progressive case for the party’s future during their “Fighting Oligarchy” tour. The contrast speaks volumes.\n\nThe Data for Progress poll lines up with findings from Civiqs, which showed 61% of registered voters view Schumer unfavorably, compared to just 23% who see him favorably. While he remains in positive territory among registered Democrats—54% favorable, 24% unfavorable—Civiqs found that his numbers have plummeted since Trump’s second administration began in January. \n\nCNN reported in March that several of Ocasio-Cortez’s colleagues in Congress have been quietly urging her to primary Schumer in 2028. Schumer, for his part, has shrugged off the chatter. \n\n“That’s a long time away,” he told The New York Times that same month. “I’m focused on bringing Trump’s numbers down, his popularity down, exposing what he has done to America and what he will do. That’s my focus right now.”\n\nWhat Ocasio-Cortez wants to do next remains unclear. Sources close to her say she’s not eyeing a 2028 presidential run, and she previously passed on the chance to challenge New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand in 2024.\n\nBut if she decides to take on Schumer, she won’t be short on ammunition. Schumer led nine other Senate Democrats in voting for a GOP-authored funding bill—without securing a single concession—despite widespread outrage from the base. Rather than owning up to the move as a cave to Trump and tech billionaire Elon Musk’s extreme agenda, Schumer framed his decision as one of those “tough” leadership calls. \n\nVoters, though, aren’t buying it.\n\nThe same Data for Progress poll found that 84% of New York Democrats want their leaders to do more to oppose Trump and the MAGA movement. Just 10% think the party is doing “the right amount.”\n\nStill, Schumer has managed to claw back some establishment support. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in March that Schumer should remain Senate leader, and even Nancy Pelosi has urged him to stay the course.\n\nBut with the tide of public opinion clearly turning—and with Ocasio-Cortez waiting in the wings—Schumer’s grip on power may not be as firm as he thinks.","summary":"Last month, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer insisted he should stay on as leader of the Senate Democratic Caucus—even after betraying his party in the House by backing a partisan spending bill championed by President Donald Trump and the GOP. \n\n\n\nHowever, discontent with Democratic leadership has only grown since then. Several Senate Democrats continue bending the knee to Trump, helping him ram through abysmal Cabinet picks and advance his destructive agenda. The frustration has reached a boiling point—so much so that new polling shows a majority of voters in one key Democratic stronghold are ready to turn the page and hand the reins to a new generation.\n\n\n\nA new poll from the liberal group Data for Progress, released Friday, has progressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez trouncing Schumer in a hypothetical 2028 Senate primary in New York—leading him 55% to 36% among likely Democratic primary voters. Nine percent said they were unsure.\n\n\n\n\nOcasio-Cortez takes a photo with supporters after speaking during ","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/4/7/2314584/-Poll-shows-Chuck-Schumer-may-be-in-big-trouble?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1410378/story_image/AP25073798728650.jpg?1742327280","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 14:00:04","author":"Alex Samuels","authors":["Alex Samuels"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":308618488,"title":"This is the stock market’s worst start to a presidential term in modern history","text":"New York CNN — \nPresident Donald Trump warned Americans in 2024 that a vote for Vice President Kamala Harris would be a vote for a market meltdown.\n“You want to see a market crash?

As for her latest endeavor, the EGOT winner stars in the action movie G20, which will be released in April 2025. While promoting the film in March, Viola spoke with the Times of London and defended the project, which the publication described as an “ass-kicking American president in a preposterous hoot of an action movie.”\n\n“I don’t think every movie you do has to be considered for an Academy Award,” Viola pointed out. “I wanted to do something that families could watch together, something popular.”\n\nViola then hinted that an actor doesn’t need a career filled with only dramatic, award-winning roles. “But internally, you’re always trying to get back to the fun,” she explained, adding that she “needed some levity in [her] life,” referring to her project lineup. \n\n“The only two people you owe anything to are your 6-year-old self and your 80-year-old self,” the Fences actress said. \n\nBelow, Hollywood Life has rounded up all the details about G20!\n\nWhat Is the G20 Movie About?\n\nG20‘s official logline reads, “After the G20 Summit is overtaken by terrorists, President Danielle Sutton must bring all her statecraft and military experience to defend her family and her fellow leaders.” Viola plays Danielle.\n\nSince this is, after all, an action-packed movie, Viola joked in her Times of London interview that she “sometimes complained” about filming her fight scenes because she is a “woman of a certain age.” Nevertheless, the Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes star pointed out that she is not “not one of those women who is afraid to look muscular, and I don’t believe in losing a whole lot of weight so I can be magazine-ready — there’s still a part of me that wants to represent real life. I wanted to look capable, a leader who’s willing to jump through the plate glass first.”\n\nAs for the message of G20, Viola hopes it can connect with all audiences. However, the film is premiering months after former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 election to Republican Donald Trump. So, Viola acknowledged that, for some viewers, seeing a woman of color playing a U.S. president could “probably” stir up regret “in hindsight.” However, she pointed out that they “created this movie before [the 2024 election].”\n\n“I do not think it’s a suspension of disbelief to imagine someone who looks like me as the president,” Viola told the publication. “If you get down to the nitty gritty, we just wanna reach people.”\n\nWhen Does Viola Davis’ G20 Movie Come Out?\n\nG20 premieres on April 10, 2025.\n\nWhere to Watch the G20 Movie\n\nG20 is scheduled to be released on the Prime Video platform by Amazon MGM Studios.","summary":"Viola plays a president in the latest action movie titled 'G20.'

We are seeing organizations stay quiet. We are seeing those who are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats.

Like many well-heeled L.A. Democrats, the donor had been feeling disillusioned with the party and its candidate after giving so much last year only to see Trump sweep all swing states. Now Trump’s grievance-fueled authoritarian and Project 2025 measures have hit Americans hard and relentlessly the past 70-odd days, the tide may be turning.\n“A lot more of that, more Cory Booker, more Harris, more Bernie, more everyone,” the donor went on to say, namechecking the New Jersey senator who took to the upper chamber’s floor for a record breaking 24 hours-plus speech this week. “Finally, someone’s fighting back!”\n\nAt least one producer and mega Hollywood donor described the former vice president’s comments as being “too little, too late.”\n\n“No one wants to hear from her, just go away,” the producer told Deadline.\n\nIn early February, however, Harris appeared to brush rumors of a gubernatorial bid aside.\n\n“I have been home for two weeks and three days,” she said. “My plans are to be in touch with my community, to be in touch with the leaders and figure out what I can do to support them,”\n\nPaul Roland Bois directed the award-winning Christian tech thriller, EXEMPLUM, which has a 100% Rotten Tomatoes critic rating and can be viewed for FREE on YouTube, Tubi, or Fawesome TV. “Better than Killers of the Flower Moon,” wrote Mark Judge. “You haven’t seen a story like this before,” wrote Christian Toto.

Gavin Newsom says he is inviting prominent followers of President Trump onto his podcasts to learn why Democrats “are getting our ass kicked.” He should look in the mirror. Newsom epitomizes much of what he thinks is wrong with the Democratic Party. Moreover, Democrats really haven’t been getting their asses kicked. Most of the contests the party is having a nervous breakdown over — especially last year’s presidential election — were fairly close. There’s no great mystery about the 2024 results, regardless of what Newsom says. Several losses could have been turned into victories with better candidates and messaging, most crucially at the top of the ticket. The California governor began his “This is Gavin Newsom” podcasts early last month, saying he wanted to engage people he “deeply disagreed with” to shed public light on why Republicans were whipping Democrats in elections. That stirred controversy among many Democratic politicians and activists, as well as some media commentators. They’ve criticized the governor for giving unnecessary voice to Trump boosters and their right-wing causes while blandly not pushing back. The concept of generating podcasts is fine if the governor can fit them in while addressing homelessness, housing affordability, wildfires, climate change and a red-ink budget. A big “if.” Podcasts might help the governor sell his agenda to the public and enhance his national profile for a potential 2028 presidential bid. But it’s laughable to rationalize them as a way to discover what’s ailing the Democratic Party. Newspapers, television and the Internet are crammed with opinions about that from all sides. Particularly eye-catching was the governor’s recent interview with Times reporter Taryn Luna, a close Newsom watcher. Newsom told Luna he’s inviting conservatives on the podcasts “to have civil conversations to try to understand each other at this time of such polarization.” “Because our party’s getting our ass kicked,” he continued. “Because the Democratic Party brand is toxic. Because people don’t think we make any damn sense. They think we make noise. They don’t think we support them. You fill in the generic ‘them.’ They don’t think we have their values. “They think we’re elite. We talk down to people. We talk past people. They think we just think we’re smarter than other people, that we’re so judgmental and full of ourselves. … We’ve lost our way.” So, the California governor does seem to understand what millions of Americans —particularly MAGA voters — think of Democrats. But it’s hyperbole to contend that the party got its “ass kicked” last year. That’s language reserved for the butt kickings of Democrats Walter Mondale by Ronald Reagan in 1984 and George McGovern by President Nixon in 1972 — and of Republican Barry Goldwater by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris did lose the determinative electoral college vote by a decisive margin, but she barely lost the popular vote by 1.5%. Not exactly a rout. Same thing in the Senate. Democrats lost their narrow control, but Republicans won only a three-seat majority. In the House of Representatives, Democrats actually netted a two-seat gain, but Republicans retained razor-thin control by five seats. In California, Democrats gained three House seats and now outnumber Republicans 43 to 9. Democrats suffered a trifecta loss of Washington power, but not a shellacking — nothing that a more appealing presidential candidate couldn’t have remedied. Newsom participated in the debacle at the top, which was caused by a physically declining President Biden insisting on running for reelection. That robbed the party of meaningful primaries that could have allowed another candidate to build national support. “I’ll go to the ends of the Earth for this guy,” vowed Newsom, one of Biden’s most ardent rooters. In fact, the governor did go all over America stumping for the 81-year-old president. Instead, he should have joined two realistic California Democrats — former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and successful Senate candidate Adam Schiff — in pressing Biden to step down. When Biden did finally bow out, it was mid-July and too late to help the party much. No presidential wannabe had the fortitude to contest Harris at the national convention. And delegates — especially Newsom — were like deer in headlights. Harris was too tied to Biden to run a winning race. She refused to challenge his policies and avoided the campaign’s two definitive issues: illegal immigration and inflation. Another nominee seasoned by primary battles could have fared better against the very flawed Trump and provided coattails for other Democratic candidates. Newsom is one Democrat who did get his butt kicked last year. He and Democratic legislative leaders vehemently opposed Proposition 36, a ballot initiative to increase punishment for repeated retail theft and hard drug offenses, including deadly fentanyl. The governor even tried to strong-arm the measure off the ballot. Voters passed the proposition by more than 2 to 1. So that was an example of a Democratic politician not having the voters’ “values,” as Newsom would say. “Make noise?\" One rap on the governor is he makes lots of noise announcing big plans, but doesn’t always follow through with promised results. New housing construction is one example. Reducing homelessness is another. Elitism? A scar on Newsom’s legacy will always be the French Laundry episode. He attended a lobbyist friend’s birthday dinner with several people at a ritzy, super expensive restaurant in Napa Valley wine country. That not only exhibited elitism, it was highly hypocritical. It occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown when the governor was urging Californians to hunker at home, avoid mingling and wear masks. There was no mask-wearing at the birthday bash. “Lost our way?” Democrats need a new leader to follow. Next time, they’ll at least rejoin the proven path of choosing a presidential candidate during primary elections.

He emphasized Trump’s intention to “reset global trade” and asserted that the president had made this “crystal, crystal clear”.\n\nBut the treasury secretary, Scott Bessent suggested that the tariffs are a tool to leverage negotiations with other countries. Agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins echoed this by saying: “We’ve got 50 countries that are burning the phone lines into the White House.”\n\nAlso on Sunday:\n\n• The Guardian revealed that Trump’s national security adviser, Mike Waltz, included a journalist in the Signal group chat about plans for US strikes in Yemen after he mistakenly saved his number months earlier under the contact card for a Trump spokesperson.\n\n• Pam Bondi, the attorney general, poured cold water on the idea of Trump serving a third term as president. She told Fox News Sunday: “I think he’s going to be finished, probably, after this term. We’d have to look at the constitution, and it would be a heavy lift.”\n\n5 April 2025\n\nThe biggest day of protest so far against the second Trump administration. More than 1,000 “Hands Off” demonstrations took place across the US over issues including the firing of thousands of federal workers, the shutting down of entire government agencies, deportation of immigrants, the scaling back of protections for transgender people and cutting funding for health programs.\n\nThe protests were organized by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labour unions, LGBTQ+ advocates, military veterans and election activists. Anger with Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk was expressed in a sea of placards and banners on the national mall in Washington.\n\nAlso on Saturday:\n\nThe Trump administration, through secretary of state Marco Rubio, announced the revocation of all visas for South Sudanese passport holders and a block on new arrivals due to the country’s failure to repatriate its citizens expelled from the US.The Trump administration apologized for accidentally informing some Ukrainian refugees fleeing their country’s invasion by Russia that they needed to leave the US because their legal status was being revoked.\n\n4 April 2025\n\nDisruption to global financial markets continued in the wake of Trump’s sweeping tariffs. But the president showed no signs of backing down, writing on his Truth Social platform: “TO THE MANY INVESTORS COMING INTO THE UNITED STATES AND INVESTING MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF MONEY, MY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE.”\n\nThe Federal Reserve chair, Jerome Powell said he expects the tariffs to hike prices and slow economic growth while indicating the central bank would wait to make any changes to monetary policy as it seeks more clarity. “We face a highly uncertain outlook with elevated risks of both higher unemployment and higher inflation,” he told reporters.\n\nAlso on Friday:\n\nThe US economy added 228,000 jobs in March, and the unemployment rate edged higher to 4.2%.Trump announced another extension to the deadline for the ban or sale of TikTok, pushing it back by 75 days. This delay reportedly occurred after China put a potential deal on hold following the announcement of the sweeping tariffs.\n\n3 April 2025\n\nTrump’s latest tariff announcement triggered a significant downturn in global financial markets. US markets experienced their worst single-day losses in nearly five years, with the Dow, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all closing sharply lower. This marked the most significant drop since the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic in June 2020.\n\nThe financial impact was substantial, with an estimated $2.5trn wiped off Wall Street alone. But Trump told reporters: “I think it’s going very well … We’ve never seen anything like it. The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.”\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\nTrump fired six national security council staffers after a meeting in the Oval Office in which far-right activist Laura Loomer presented “opposition research” alleging their disloyalty.It emerged the Pentagon’s internal watchdog is launching an investigation into defense secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss sensitive military information regarding operations in Yemen.\n\n2 April 2025\n\n“Liberation day.” Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, upending decades of US economic policy and potentially triggering a global trade war.\n\nAt a Rose Garden event flanked by US flags, his cabinet and union workers, the president declared that the US will impose a baseline 10% rate on all imports starting 5 April as well as much higher “reciprocal” rates for dozens of countries that will take hold on 9 April.\n\nTrump called the announcement “our declaration of economic independence”, and claimed that “jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country”. He added: “For years, hardworking American citizens were forced to sit on the sidelines as other nations got rich and powerful, much of it at our expense. But now it’s our turn to prosper.”\n\nAlso on Wednesday:\n\nReports suggested that Elon Musk’s time in his government role is nearing its end due to a legal limit on his service. Insiders told the Politico website that Musk will leave when the 130-day cap on government service expires.National security adviser Mike Waltz and his team are using encrypted messaging app Signal extensively, it emerged, with “at least 20 different group chats ... to coordinate sensitive national security work”.\n\n1 April 2025\n\nTrump suffered his first major electoral setback as president when judge Susan Crawford, a liberal candidate, won the Wisconsin state supreme court race, defeating conservative Brad Schimel. This victory maintained a 4-3 liberal ideological majority on the highest court of a crucial swing state.\n\nThe election was the most expensive judicial contest in US history. Democrats successfully framed it as a referendum on the popularity and influence of both Trump and his close adviser Musk, who spent $25m to support Schimel.\n\nAlso on Tuesday:\n\nRepublicans retained two House of Representatives seats in Florida vacated by cabinet appointees – but by significantly smaller margins than in the November elections.Democrat Cory Booker delivered the longest speech ever by a lone senator, lasting 25 hours and five minutes, staring his intention to “disrupt the normal business of the United States Senate” to draw attention to a “nation in crisis”.The Trump administration began implementing a controversial plan to reduce the workforce at the Department of Health and Human Services, with “thousands” of employees dismissed.\n\n31 March 2025\n\nIt emerged that members of Musk’s so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge) had gained access to the Federal Personnel and Payroll System, raising significant cybersecurity concerns from senior government officials.\n\nThe system processes salaries for approximately 276,000 federal employees across various agencies. Senior staff at the interior department reportedly issued a memo warning about the “unusual nature of the request” and the “associated risks” of granting such access.\n\nAlso on Monday:\n\nThe White House announced a review of $9bn in federal contracts and grants at Harvard University over allegations of insufficient action on campus antisemitism.It was reported that the US deported 17 more individuals accused of gang membership to El Salvador without providing names or identifying information, continuing a practice of deporting people for imprisonment abroad without due process.\n\n30 March 2025\n\nTrump mused about running for a third term, something that is prohibited by the US constitution. “Well, there are plans,” Trump said during an interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. “There are – not plans. There are methods – there are methods which you could do it, as you know.” Trump declined to give details on how he would execute such a plan.\n\n29 March 2025\n\nThere were protests in front of Tesla showrooms around the world targeted at Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who has led an effort to gut the US federal government. The protests, part of the “Tesla Takedown” movement, took place at 200 of the car company’s showrooms around the worldand organizers sought to encourage people to join the movement, not buy a Tesla car, and sell Tesla stock.\n\n28 March 2025\n\nTwo major law firms, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, sued the Trump administration over executive orders that sought to cripple the firms over their employment of Trump’s rivals. Their lawsuits came amid concern that the legal profession wasn’t doing enough to push back against efforts to punish lawyers. By Friday evening, two separate judges had ruled in favor of the firms, blocking key provisions in the executive orders.\n\nUnderscoring how fractures in the legal community, another firm, Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom reached an agreement with Trump on Friday to avoid having an executive order issue against the firm.\n\nPeter Marks, the top vaccine official in the US, was forced out of his job, citing “misinformation and lies” from Robert F Kennedy Jr.A federal district judge issued an injunction blocking efforts to dismantle the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.JD Vance visited Greenland in an effort to escalate as part of Donald Trump’s interest in acquiring the country. “I think Greenland understands that the United States should own it,” the vice-president said in a press conference on Friday. “And if Denmark and the EU don’t understand it, we have to explain it to them. We need Greenland. Very importantly, for international security, we have to have Greenland.”\n\n27 March 2025\n\nTrump announced he was pulling the nomination of Elise Stefanik, a Republican congresswoman from upstate New York, to be his ambassador to the UN. Republicans have a narrow majority in the US House and the decision to pull Stefanik’s nomination reflects that they may be skittish about their prospects of winning a special election in her district, which Trump carried by 20 points in November.\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\nUS district judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to preserve signal messages related to the Yemen exchange.\n\n26 March 2025\n\nThe Atlantic published the full tranche of text messages included in the chat with Goldberg. He had initially withheld them out of concern for national security. Publishing the messages offered the public an unfiltered look at the spectacular detail that advisers had been discussing, and offered a powerful rebuttal to the White House, which had been trying to downplay the severity of the information that was shared.\n\nThe White House was still defiant that it had done nothing wrong, but the disclosure escalated pressure on the administration, which insisted that the details weren’t classified.\n\nAlso on Wednesday:\n\nFootage emerged on Wednesday of masked Ice agents arresting and detaining a graduate student at Tufts. It was the latest example of the administration targeting students who express support for Palestinian rights. The only public example of Ozturk’s support for Palestinians is a joint op-ed she co-authored in the Tufts student newspaper.The Trump administration signed a probably unlawful executive order seeking to add a proof of citizenship requirement to the federal voter registration form, among other things. Such a chance would likely disenfranchise millions of people. Civil rights groups pledged quick action to challenge the action in court.Trump announced a 25% tariff on cars from overseas.\n\n25 March 2025\n\nDemocrats on the Senate intelligence committee grilled Waltz; the CIA director, John Ratcliffe; and Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, over the Signal chat as the Trump administration sprinted to contain the fallout from the incident. Democrats escalated their calls for Hegseth’s resignation.\n\n“I think this is one more example of the kind of sloppy, careless, incompetent behavior, particularly towards classified information,” Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said during the hearing.\n\nThe officials said no classified information was shared in the chat. Gabbard dodged questions about whether she would have disclosed the information and whether she was using a personal or work cellphone while in that chat. Ratcliffe defended the use of signal and said it was allowed.\n\nBy Tuesday evening, Waltz was claiming responsibility for the debacle. “A staffer wasn’t responsible. I take full responsibility. I built the group. My job is to make sure everything is coordinated,” he said during an interview on Fox News.\n\n24 March 2025\n\nJeffrey Goldberg, the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic magazine, published a bombshell story in which he revealed that top administration officials had accidentally included him in a group chat on the encrypted messaging platform Signal in which they discussed and shared details of a US bombing effort in Yemen. The group included top officials in the US government, including the vice-president, JD Vance; the secretary of defense, Pete Hegseth; the secretary of state, Marco Rubio; and the national security adviser, Mike Waltz.\n\nThe story immediately exploded and became one of the biggest scandals of Trump’s second term. It prompted immediate scrutiny over whether the administration’s top officials had disclosed classified information, a criminal offense. There were also questions about why they were using Signal, which allows users to autodelete messages, to discuss such sensitive matters, and not official systems for sharing sensitive information.\n\nHegseth, who shared details of the strike in the chat, remained defiant. “Nobody was texting war plans,” Hegseth told reporters after landing in Hawaii late Monday, “and that’s all I have to say about that.”\n\n23 March 2025\n\nThe Trump administration defended using the 1798 Alien Enemies Act, a wartime law, to deport 137 Venezuelan immigrants last weekend on the grounds that they were allegedly committing violent crimes and sending money back to Venezuela. The US border czar, Tom Homan, said in an interview with ABC News that the administration would not defy court orders stemming from legal challenges. “I don’t care what the judges think as far as this case,” Homan told ABC.\n\nMeanwhile, the attorney general, Pam Bondi, called the fight against the alleged gang members akin to “modern day warfare” in a Fox News interview.\n\nAlso on Sunday:\n\nThe secretary of state, Marco Rubio, held a call with Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday “to emphasize US support for Israel”. Among the topics discussed were ongoing military operations in Gaza and a reminder that the US was willing to continue bombing Yemen to target the Houthis over their re-triggered aims at blocking navigation in the Red Sea.\n\n22 March 2025\n\nThe defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, joined the Trump administration’s growing criticism of federal judges on Saturday, mocking the US district judge Ana Reyes who had blocked the president’s ban on transgender troops in the military. In a social media post, Hegseth sarcastically referred to the Joe Biden-appointed judge as “Commander Reyes” and suggested she had overstepped her authority by ruling on military matters.\n\n“Since ‘Judge’ Reyes is now a top military planner, she/they can report to Fort Benning at 0600 to instruct our Army Rangers on how to execute High Value Target Raids,” Hegseth wrote.\n\n21 March 2025\n\nTrump acknowledged on Friday that Elon Musk’s business interests in China created a conflict of interest that would prevent the billionaire from being briefed on potential war plans with the country. “Elon has businesses in China. And he would be susceptible, perhaps, to that,” Trump said, a rare admission considering Musk’s dual role as both a senior presidential adviser and business leader.\n\nThe comment came after reporting from the New York Times and later the Wall Street Journal indicated that Musk was planning to visit the Pentagon that morning to receive a classified briefing on China. The president confirmed that Musk had indeed visited the Pentagon, but said it was to discuss cost reductions through his so-called “department of government efficiency” (Doge), while Hegseth added that Musk was there “to talk about efficiencies, to talk about innovations”.\n\nAlso on Friday:\n\nColumbia University conceded to a list of demands from the Trump administration as a condition to begin negotiations on restoring $400m in federal funding that was stripped from the university earlier this month. The demands reportedly include banning students from wearing masks at protests, hiring 36 new campus security officers with all-new arrest powers and appointing a new senior vice-provost to oversee the department of Middle East, South Asian and African Studies.Trump issued a presidential memo revoking security clearances for Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and other political opponents who are typically extended intelligence briefings as a courtesy. The revocations also apply to former secretary of state Antony Blinken, former representatives Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, New York attorney general Letitia James, and Biden’s entire family.\n\n20 March 2025\n\nTrump signed an executive order instructing the education secretary, Linda McMahon, to begin dismantling the Department of Education, attempting to bypass the congressional approval typically needed to eliminate a federal agency. At a White House signing ceremony, Trump declared his administration would “take all lawful steps to shut down the department” and expressed hope that McMahon would be the last education secretary.\n\nThe president justified the move by claiming the department’s budget had more than doubled in recent years without corresponding improvements in national test scores, despite the fact that curriculum decisions and 90% of school funding come from state and local governments.\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\nThe labor department announced it would no longer enforce the $17.75 an hour minimum wage for federal contractors established by a Biden administration executive order. The reversal reinstates the $13.30 hourly wage set during the Obama administration and maintained during Trump’s first term. The change affects employees of federal contractors such as janitors and food service workers, with the most significant impact likely in states that adhere to the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour.\n\n19 March 2025\n\nTrump and Volodymyr Zelenskyy had their first conversation since their blow up in the White House three weeks ago, with the US president describing it as a “very good telephone call”. The Ukrainian leader characterized the discussion as “positive, very substantive and frank”, and confirmed he had agreed to a partial ceasefire that Trump had previously negotiated with Vladimir Putin. The White House said that Trump promised to help with Ukraine’s request for additional air defense batteries, suggesting a potential thaw in relations after their previously contentious face-to-face meeting.\n\nAlso on Wednesday:\n\nFederal Reserve officials cut their US economic growth forecasts from 2.1% to 1.7% and raised inflation projections to 2.7% for the year as they kept interest rates unchanged amid Trump’s sweeping tariffs policy.A New York federal judge denied the Trump administration’s bid to dismiss the legal challenge brought by Mahmoud Khalil, the Palestinian activist detained by immigration agents, and ordered the case transferred to New Jersey.\n\n18 March 2025\n\nThe Trump administration acknowledged in court filings that it had fired nearly 25,000 recently hired federal workers and said agencies were working to reinstate all of them after a judge ruled their terminations were likely illegal. Documents submitted to Baltimore’s federal courthouse included statements from officials at 18 agencies, who confirmed the reinstated probationary workers were being placed on administrative leave at least temporarily. The treasury department terminated approximately 7,600 people, the Department of Agriculture about 5,700, and the Department of Health and Human Services more than 3,200, marking the first full accounting of the mass firings carried out by Musk’s Doge.\n\nAlso on Tuesday:\n\nThe chief justice, John Roberts, issued a rare public rebuke of Trump after the president demanded the impeachment of the federal judge James Boasberg, who blocked the deportation of Venezuelan alleged gang members.A federal judge ruled that Musk and Doge likely violated the constitution by shutting down USAID. The US district judge Theodore Chuang ordered the administration to reverse actions taken to dismantle the agency, including halting terminations and reinstating former employee access to government systems.The administration released thousands of pages of files concerning the assassination of John F Kennedy.Trump fired the two Democratic commissioners on the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), Alvaro Bedoya and Rebecca Kelly Slaughter. Bedoya confirmed his firing on social media, writing: “The President just illegally fired me,” and claimed Trump “wants the Ftc to be a lap dog for his golfing buddies”.\n\n17 March 2025\n\nTrump claimed on Monday, without providing evidence, that pardons signed by Biden were “void, vacant and of no further force and effect” because they were signed with an autopen rather than by Biden himself. That assertion made on Truth Social targeted pardons given to members of the House January 6 committee, Anthony Fauci, his son Hunter, and others. “In other words, Joe Biden did not sign them but, more importantly, he did not know anything about them!” Trump wrote in the post.\n\nAlso on Monday:\n\nThe Trump administration removed the former surgeon general Vivek Murthy’s advisory on gun violence as a public health issue from the Department of Health and Human Services website.Trump announced the immediate termination of Secret Service protection for Biden’s adult children, Hunter and Ashley Biden. In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Hunter “has had Secret Service protection for an extended period of time, all paid for by the United States Taxpayer” and that both he and Ashley would be “taken off the list”.The White House denied violating a judge’s order blocking the deportation of Venezuelan alleged gang members to El Salvador. Despite the denial, Homan, the US border czar, appeared to contradict this stance by saying: “I don’t care what the judges think.”\n\n16 March 2025\n\nThe Trump administration appeared to violate a court order by sending hundreds of Venezuelans accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador. El Salvador’s president, Nayib Bukele, posted on social media that 238 members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and 23 members of the Salvadoran gang MS-13 had arrived and were in custody as part of a deal under which the US will pay the Central American country to hold them in its 40,000-person capacity “terrorism confinement centre”. But Bukele’s post came hours after the chief US district judge in Washington, James Boasberg, blocked the deportations and ordered any flights to turn around in an order issued at 7pm ET.\n\n15 March 2025\n\nA federal judge ordered the Trump administration to stop using an obscure wartime law to deport hundreds of Venezuelans without a hearing, ruling in an emergency order that any deportation flights that had already departed from the US needed to return. In an emergency hearing, the chief US district judge in Washington, James Boasberg, said he would issue a temporary order blocking the administration from using the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to target suspected Venezuelan gang members with little or no due process. “This is something you need to make sure is complied with immediately,” Boasberg directed the government.\n\nAlso on Saturday:\n\nThe FBI director, Kash Patel, announced a reorganization of the bureau by decentralizing the command structure and dividing field offices over three regions. The change means the top FBI officials in 52 field offices would no longer answer to the deputy director, and instead to three “branch directors” at FBI headquarters who will be in charge of the east, west and central regions. The remaining three FBI offices – the largest in the country – of New York, Washington and Los Angeles will continue to report to the deputy director.\n\n14 March 2025\n\nCementing his literal and physical takeover of the justice department, Donald Trump swept into its headquarters to rail against the criminal cases he defeated by virtue of returning to the presidency in an extraordinary victory lap the department had perhaps never before seen. The event was billed as a policy address for the administration to tout its focus on combating illegal immigration and drug trafficking, but the majority of the president’s freewheeling remarks focused instead on his personal grievances with the department. Trump spoke from a specially constructed stage in the great hall of the main justice building, in front of a velvet blue curtain that notably hid away two art deco statues depicting the “Spirit of Justice” and the “Majesty of Justice”.\n\nAlso on Friday:\n\nTrump attacked a private law firm for the third time since taking office, signing an executive order that suspended its lawyers from holding security clearances and restricted its employees from entering federal buildings, getting government jobs or receiving any money from federal contracts. The aggressive move came two days after a federal judge in Washington issued a temporary injunction that blocked a similar order against the law firm Perkins Coie from taking immediate effect.\n\n13 March 2025\n\nDonald Trump threatened to escalate a trade war with the European Union, saying in a social media post that he could impose 200% tariffs on European wine and champagne. The announcement came a day after the EU unveiled plans to retaliate against a batch of US tariffs that took effect this week on steel aluminum, by imposing 50% tariffs on imports of US whiskey and several other American products. The EU said the retaliatory tariffs would come in two waves: first, with tariffs as high as 50% on US products including Harley-Davidson motorcycles and Kentucky bourbon that took effect on 1 April; and second, tariffs in mid-April that would target farm products and industrial goods that disproportionately affected Republican-leaning districts.\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\nThe Guardian reported that the US defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, had set forth plans to start a sweeping overhaul of the judge advocate general’s corps as part of an effort to make the US military less restricted by the laws of armed conflict. The possible changes, under the leadership of Hegseth’s personal lawyer and former naval commander Tim Parlatore, ranged from a reinterpretation of the US rules of engagement on the battlefield to the way that charges are brought under the military justice system.The Trump administration asked the US supreme court to lift a nationwide pause imposed on the president’s executive order ending birthright citizenship for the children of undocumented immigrants and foreign residents. The move marked the first time that Trump’s birthright citizenship order reached the nation’s highest court after three federal courts, in Massachusetts, Maryland and Washington state, had temporarily blocked the order from taking effect.\n\n12 March 2025\n\nDonald Trump’s sweeping tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum went into effect, sparking immediate threats of retaliation from the EU and with a series of trading partners. The tariffs of 25% hit metal imports from every country that sells steel and aluminum to the US. Many domestic steel and aluminum manufacturers supported the move, saying it would protect their industry against foreign competitors, but Canada said it would impose retaliatory tariffs on $20bn worth of American imports, including metals, computers and sporting goods. And the EU announced tariffs on up to $28bn worth of goods including bourbon, boats and motorcycles.\n\nAlso on Wednesday:\n\nA federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked a vast portion of Donald Trump’s executive order that threatened to hurt a major law firm from taking effect, ruling the president used national security concerns as a pretext to punish the firm Perkins Coie for once working with Hillary Clinton. The US district judge Beryl Howell rejected Trump’s contentions and entered a temporary restraining order on Wednesday that halted most of the executive order. The restraining order did not apply to the revocation of clearances, since Perkins Coie had not sought that in their request.Elon Musk signaled to Donald Trump’s advisers that he wants to put $100m into groups controlled by the Trump political operation, the New York Times reported. Musk suggested he wanted to make the donations not to his own Super Pac, which is called America Pac and has spent heavily on Trump’s campaign during the 2024 election, but to an entity affiliated with the president.\n\n11 March 2025\n\nDonald Trump climbed into a cherry-red Tesla Model S and vowed to buy it in an extraordinary promotion of Tesla at the White House, as Musk’s companies faced escalating protests in response to his aggressive cost-cutting efforts as the de-facto head of the “department of government efficiency”. Trump said that Musk has been “treated very unfairly by a very small group of people”, in an apparent reference to peaceful protests and violence against Tesla dealerships and charging stations. The event on the South Lawn raised ethics questions of the president rewarding a donor and ally by giving Musk’s company free advertising with the White House as a backdrop.\n\nAlso on Tuesday:\n\nThe US education department announced that it was firing more than 1,300 workers, effectively gutting the agency that manages federal loans for colleges and enforces civil rights laws in schools. The cuts could be a harbinger for Trump to essentially shut down the department, as he has said he wants to do, even though it cannot be closed without the approval of Congress.\n\n10 March 2025\n\nThe Trump administration invoked an obscure immigration law in an attempt to deport a recent Columbia University graduate and a lawful US permanent resident who helped lead campus protests against Israel last year. Mahmoud Khalil, 30, who graduated in December with a master’s degree from Columbia, was arrested by Ice officers in New York on Saturday and sent to a detention center in Louisiana. Khalil was told by Ice officers that his student visa was being revoked, but when he replied that he actually held a green card, Ice officers told him that was being pulled too. A federal judge in Manhattan ordered the government not to deport Khalil while the legality of his detention was under review in a legal challenge.\n\nAlso on Monday:\n\nThe justice department’s pardon attorney was dismissed a day after she refused to recommend that the actor Mel Gibson, a prominent Trump supporter, should have his gun rights restored. Elizabeth Oyer said she had been asked to add Gibson’s name to a list of people who were being vetted to have their rights restored after he lost them following a 2011 domestic violence misdemeanor conviction.\n\n9 March 2025\n\nTrump declined to the rule out the possibility that the US economy could fall into a recession and that inflation could rise as uncertainty continued over his tariffs policy. “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we’re doing is very big,” he told Fox News.\n\nAlso on Sunday:\n\nOn Ukraine, the president told reporters on board Air Force One that the US had “just about ended” its suspension of intelligence with the country and said he expected good results ahead of forthcoming talks with Ukrainian officials in Saudi Arabia.\n\n8 March 2025\n\nTrump insisted Musk and Marco Rubio, the US secretary of state, had a “great relationship” after the New York Times reported details of the pair facing off in an angry exchange during the cabinet meeting called to clear the air over Doge cuts. “There is no clash,” Trump wrote in a social media post, despite Elon Musk reportedly lambasting Rubio for firing “nobody” and dismissing him as being “good on TV”, while the secretary of state hit back by voicing his resentment over Doge’s gutting of USAid, the foreign assistance agency over which he is nominally in charge.\n\nAlso on Saturday:\n\nTrump warned Republicans against shutting down the government as a 14 March deadline loomed that would spell that very outcome in the absence of the adoption of a new spending bill. Instead, the president urged GOP members of Congress to maintain unity and vote for a stop gap funding bill stitched together by Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate.\n\n7 March 2025\n\nIn more troubling remarks on Ukraine, Trump said he found it easier to deal with Russia and appeared to sympathize with Vladimir Putin after massive Russian air strikes that followed the decision to stop US intelligence sharing with Kyiv. Putin was “doing what anybody would do”, Trump said – despite have issued, hours earlier, a vague threat to impose sanctions and tariffs on Moscow over the strike.\n\nAlso on Friday:\n\nThe administration announced the cancellation of $400m in grants to Columbia University in New York over the institution’s supposed failure to protect students from antisemitic harassment. The university’s New York campus – in common with others throughout the US – has been the site of prolonged protests against Israel’s military bombardment of Gaza.Trump said he would sign an executive order barring student loan forgiveness to public servants engaged in “improper activities”.\n\n6 March 2025\n\nTrump performed yet another backflip on tariffs, delaying imposing import duties on goods from Canada and Mexico until April. The move followed nervousness on the stock market, with the S&P 500 index falling by 1.8% in a single day. The president, however, claimed his volte face had “nothing to do” with market developments.\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\nAs controversy raged over the cuts to government agencies imposed by Doge, Musk told congressional Republicans that he was not to blame for the mass firings that had provoked widespread outrage. At a cabinet meeting in the White House apparently called to addressing simmering cabinet discontent, Trump said department heads and not Musk – who was present – had the power to hire and fire federal workers and said they should do so wielding a “scalpel” to preserve the best people. The comment was widely seen as signalling the reining of Musk, who had been widely seen as running amok across government.\n\n5 March 2025\n\nHaving already cut off the flow of arms, the Trump administration hit Ukraine with a fresh blow by stopping the sharing of intelligence with its supposed ally. The move in effect left the Ukrainians blind to Russian strategic bombers and ballistic missile launches.\n\nAlso on Wednesday:\n\nA day after ushering in in 25% tariffs on all goods from Canada and Mexico – the US’s two closest trading partners – the president performed a partial U-turn by exempting car makers. The move followed a call with the heads of the country’s three biggest car manufacturers, General Motors, Ford and Stellantis. Meanwhile, leading US retailers warned that prices were “highly likely” to start rising as a result of the tariffs, a consequence at odds with Trump’s election campaign promise to “make America affordable again”.\n\n4 March 2025\n\nIn an extraordinarily rambunctious, one-hour, 40-minute address to a joint session of Congress, Trump declared that his presidency was “just getting started” after his whirlwind return to the White House that has seen a flurry of executive orders and the federal bureaucracy upended in a drastic cost-cutting measures spearheaded by Doge. Democrats registered protests by holding of placards as Trump spoke, while some left the chamber early. and one, Al Green of Texas, was ejected after shouting that Trump had “no mandate”.\n\nAlso on Tuesday:\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president, issued a statement aimed at placating Trump, who had proclaimed him unready to make peace with Russia. Faced with a loss of US support, the Ukrainian president said he was ready to work “constructively” under Trump’s “strong leadership”.\n\n3 March 2025\n\nIn a dramatic escalation of his rupture with Zelenskyy. Trump paused all military aid to Ukraine in its war with Russia, causing yet more consternation to Washington’s Nato allies. European anxieties were compounded further when Vance appeared to dismiss British and French capacity to guarantee Ukraine’s future security. Pressing the case for a mineral deal with the US as the best guarantor, JD Vance, the US vice-president, told Fox News: “That is a way better security guarantee than 20,000 troops from some random country that hasn’t fought a war in 30 or 40 years.” The comment was taken as an insult in Britain – which along with France, has offered to send peacekeeping troops and whose forces fought in US-led military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n2 March 2025\n\nThe fallout continued from Trump and Zelenskyy’s disastrous Oval Office meeting, as the Ukrainian leader sought to recalibrate and insisted a minerals deal was ready to be signed during a diplomatic visit to London. While Europe rallies behind Ukraine, Trump’s Republican allies, including the House speaker, Mike Johnson, said Zelenskyy may have to resign, a suggestion Senator Bernie Sanders called “horrific”. The Democratic senator Chris Murphy said Trump’s White House had in effect become “an arm of the Kremlin”.\n\nAlso on Sunday:\n\nThe health and human services secretary, Robert F Kennedy Jr, urged Americans to get the MMR vaccine in response to a growing measles epidemic in Texas, days after Kennedy, who has long sowed skepticism with his endorsement of anti-vaccine conspiracy theories, downplayed the situation as “not unusual”.\n\n1 March 2025\n\nA federal judge in Washington blocked Trump from ousting the leader of a federal watchdog agency, ruling that the effort to terminate the official without cause was “unlawful”. The decision by US district judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington allows Hampton Dellinger to remain the head of the office of special counsel, which protects federal whistleblowers. In her ruling, Jackson wrote that upholding the president’s ability to fire Dellinger would give him “a constitutional license to bully officials in the executive branch into doing his will”. The case is likely to be decided by the supreme court.\n\nAlso on Saturday:\n\nMusk renewed his demand that every federal employee send an email detailing their recent accomplishments, a week after the original demand sparked chaos and confusion across the government workforce.Trump signed an executive order establishing English as the official language of the US.Supporters of Ukraine protested against the Trump administration across the US, including a Vermont ski resort where Vance was vacationing with his family.\n\n28 February 2025\n\nIn the explosive Oval Office meeting, Trump and Vance assailed and berated Zelenskyy in a storm of accusations and falsehoods about Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The tense exchange ended with Zelenskyy leaving the White House early, without signing a controversial minerals deal that was seen as key to unlocking US security guarantees for European peacekeepers in Ukraine. During the exchange, which played out publicly on live TV, Trump said Zelenskyy was “gambling with world war three” and told the Ukrainian president to come back “when he is ready for peace”. Hours later, Zelenskyy sought to de-escalate the situation in an interview on Fox News, but Trump appeared unmoved as he departed Washington for his Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nAlso on Friday:\n\nEuropean leaders and Democrats rallied around Zelenskyy, voicing continued support for Ukraine, while Trump’s Republican allies demand the Ukrainian leader apologize.The White House said that classified documents seized by the FBI from Mar-a-Lago in 2022 had been returned to Trump.The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said that Trump had “asked Zelenskyy and the Ukrainians to depart the White House” after their contentious exchange in the Oval Office.The Democratic party sued Trump over a recent executive order it says violates federal election law by giving him too much power over the independent federal election commission.\n\n27 February 2025\n\nKeir Starmer, the British prime minister, arrived at the White House bearing a letter from King Charles as he quietly appealed to Trump not to abandon Ukraine as the US president searches for a speedy end to Russia’s brutal invasion of the country. In remarks, Starmer praised Trump for “changing the conversation” and making peace possible in Ukraine while Trump denied calling Zelenskyy a dictator, despite having done so, and suggested Vladimir Putin could be trusted. En route to Washington, Starmer pledged to raise the country’s defense spending, a commitment seen as a way to persuade Trump to provide a “backstop” for European security in Ukraine. And in a major relief for the British premier, Trump indicated that he would not slap harsh tariffs on the UK.\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\nA federal judge found that the mass firings of probationary employees as part of the Trump administration’s government downsizing effort were likely unlawful.The ruling came on the same day that the Trump administration moved to terminate hundreds of workers at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (Noaa), the US’s pre-eminent climate research agency housed within the Department of Commerce.Senate Democrats publicly – and some Republicans privately – raised concerns over the Trump administration’s freeze on foreign aid and cuts to USAid.\n\n26 February 2025\n\nDonald Trump used the first full cabinet meeting of his second term to heap praise on Musk and his billionaire ally’s mission to dramatically reduce the size of the federal government. Though not a member of Trump’s cabinet, Musk attended and took center stage as the secretaries sat mostly silently for the hourlong meeting. The tech mogul defended Doge’s actions, which have stoked confusion and backlash, but conceded that the team would make mistakes, citing a decision to cancel an Ebola prevention effort that was “quickly” reinstated. During the summit, Trump also threatened to slap 25% tariffs on the European Union and announced that the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, would visit the White House to sign a minerals deal with the US.\n\nAlso on Wednesday:\n\nA new White House memo instructed federal agencies to submit plans for “a significant reduction” in their staff by 13 March, potentially setting the stage to shrink the government workforce by tens of thousands more in the coming weeks. A top Senate Democrat warned that Trump may be pursuing a mineral rights deal with Vladimir Putin and Russia as well as Zelenskyy and Ukraine.A Pentagon memo filed in court on Wednesday said transgender service members would be separated from the US military unless they receive an exemption.The supreme court handed the president his first victory, granting the Trump administration’s request to pause a lower court’s deadline for the government to resume nearly $2bn in foreign aid payments.\n\n25 February 2025\n\nIn a dramatic vote, House Republicans unified behind a budget blueprint, taking a major step toward advancing Donald Trump’s “big BEAUTIFUL” tax cut and immigration agenda. But vulnerable Republicans face a brewing backlash over the plan, which would almost certainly require significant reductions to social safety net programs that serve the poor. House Democrats plan to hammer Republicans over their support for the measure and the potential cuts to Medicaid required to pay for it as they plot a return to power in next year’s midterms. But Trump’s fiscal plan is far from guaranteed: Republican negotiators from both the House and Senate must now reconcile their competing budget blueprints to move forward.\n\nAlso on Tuesday:\n\nThe White House said it would pick which media outlets are allowed to participate in the presidential press pool, drawing sharp condemnation from the White House Correspondents’ Association, which warned: “In a free country, leaders must not be able to choose their own press corps.”The Trump administration announced that immigrants in the US without authorization could face fines and prison time if they fail to submit their personal data to a government registry while the president floated the creation of a “gold card” visa that would give wealthy foreigners a pathway to citizenship for a $5m fee.\n\n24 February 2025\n\nThe US office of personnel management told agency officials that federal workers were not required to respond to billionaire Elon Musk’s demand that they defend their recent accomplishments or risk being fired, even as Donald Trump indicated support for the ultimatum. The email sparked widespread chaos and confusion amid ongoing turmoil Musk’s Doge has inflicted on the federal workforce. After government departments gave their employees differing instructions as to whether they should respond to the message, OPM, which manages the federal workforce, announced that compliance with the email was voluntary and that failing to do so by midnight would not be considered a resignation, as Musk had warned.\n\nAlso on Monday:\n\nFrance’s president, Emmanuel Macron, warned Trump against a “surrender” of Ukraine during a visit to the White House, as the US president said Vladimir Putin would accept European peacekeepers in Ukraine as part of a potential deal to end the conflict. (The Kremlin has pushed back on this.)Earlier in the day, the US joined Russia, Belarus and North Korea in voting against an EU-Ukrainian resolution condemning Russia on the third anniversary of its full-scale invasion, another sign of Trump’s sharp turn toward Putin.\n\n23 February 2025\n\nAnti-Trump conservatives and centrists held a competing conference this weekend, dubbed Principles First, to counter the Conservative Political Action Conference’s (CPAC) Trump fest. But Principles First attenders, particularly officers who defended the Capitol during the insurrection, saw harassment from January 6 pardonee and Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, and the conference was subject to bomb threats on 23 February signed “Enrique T”. that said it was to honor the “J6 hostages” and “Emperor Trump”.\n\nAlso on Sunday:\n\nSome at CPAC advocated for overriding the constitution to elect Trump for a third term, calling their quest for a Trump reign the Third Term Project. But at least one elected Republican, Oklahoma senator Markwayne Mullin, said he didn’t support the idea.\n\n22 February 2025\n\nTrump took the stage at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) for an all-out brag session, claiming he had saved the country and actually won the election by more, repeating unspecified lies that Democrats were cheating on elections. His victory lap included boasts of pardoning January 6 rioters, some of whom were in attendance, and killing diversity initiatives.\n\nElon Musk orchestrated emails sent by the Trump administration to all federal workers demanding they outline in five bullet points what they did at their jobs in the past week or risk termination, the latest escalation against the civil service. Kash Patel, the newly confirmed FBI director, told his agency employees they didn’t need to respond, and other agencies told workers to hold off on replies as well.\n\n21 February 2025\n\nThe Associated Press sued the Trump administration after Trump’s team blocked the news agency from attending press events because the organization has continued using “Gulf of Mexico” in its reporting rather than the Trump-branded “Gulf of America”.\n\nAlso on Friday:\n\nTrump reassigned the top official at US Immigration and Customs Enforcement in an effort to speed up deportations. The administration also rescinded its decision to cut off legal aid for unaccompanied immigrant children, just three days after it ordered government-funded attorneys across the country to immediately stop their work, a sign of the chaotic nature of the Trump presidency.\n\nSeparately, the Proud Boys were back in Washington DC, with key leaders fresh off their Trump pardons for participating in the January 6 insurrection. Enrique Tarrio, a former national leader of the far-right group, was arrested near the US Capitol on a charge that he assaulted a woman protesting a gathering attended by him and others who received pardons.\n\n20 February 2025\n\nTrump’s acolytes, riding high after one month of slash-and-burn rightwing governance, gathered for the Conservative Political Action Conference. Elon Musk appeared in sunglasses and a black Maga hat and wielded a chainsaw given to him as a gift by far-right Argentinian president Javier Milei. Steve Bannon, the far-right leader and Trump booster, gave a fascist-style salute on stage.\n\nAt the conference, JD Vance said immigration was the “greatest threat” to Europe and the US, at least until 30 days ago here.\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\nTrump continued the mass firing of federal workers, axing people at the Internal Revenue Service and in disaster recovery, among others. Some fired were then rehired, including public health workers responsible for responding to the spreading bird flu.\n\n19 February 2025\n\n“LONG LIVE THE KING!” Trump said of himself after moving to block a congestion pricing policy in New York City, inviting a legal battle with his home state. His claim of royalty brought strong backlash after his first month in office included various ways he’s attempting to consolidate power and threats to defy the courts if they go against his wishes.\n\nAlso on Wednesday:\n\nTrump attempted to rewrite the history of Russia’s war against Ukraine, saying Ukraine started it when in reality Russia invaded the country unprovoked.\n\nTrump called Volodymyr Zelenskyy a “dictator” after the Ukrainian president said Trump appeared to be “trapped” in a Russian “disinformation bubble”.\n\n18 February 2025\n\nTrump signed an executive order to expand his power over independent agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, claiming he requires “presidential supervision and control of the entire executive branch”. These agencies would see presidential control over their policies and budgets, a change from the current process, under the order, which is likely to be challenged in court.\n\nAlso on Tuesday:\n\nTrump appeared with Musk in a joint interview with Fox host Sean Hannity, where the president and his billionaire backer complimented each other relentlessly: Musk said he loves Trump and called him a “good man” while Trump called Musk “brilliant” and a “very good person”.\n\nAnother executive order signed on this day calls for a report that would recommend how to reduce the costs associated with in vitro fertilization. Some in the anti-abortion movement oppose IVF and reacted negatively to the order.\n\n17 February 2025\n\nFederal workers who were on their probationary periods were fired indiscriminately across various agencies over the holiday weekend, leaving gaps in aviation, nuclear safety, national parks, food safety and a host of other government jobs. Elon Musk and his so-called “department of government efficiency” team continued their march across agencies to find areas to cut. A top Social Security Administration official quit after Musk’s team tried to access people’s personal data.\n\nAlso on Monday:\n\nProtestors showed up at state capitols and other major cities across the country to speak out against the Trump administration and Musk, rallying to “stop the coup” of the federal government.\n\nTrump nominated Edward Martin, a January 6 defender and Stop the Steal activist, to serve as US attorney for the District of Columbia. Martin had served in an interim role and was dismissing any pending cases against the January 6 rioters.\n\n16 February 2025\n\nTrump asked the supreme court to let him fire the head of a federal agency that protects government whistleblowers, marking his first appeal to the justices on America’s highest court since he took office. The justice department’s filing asked the conservative-majority court to lift a judge’s court order temporarily reinstating Hampton Dellinger as the leader of the office of special counsel.\n\nAlso on Sunday:\n\n• Trump told reporters that he believes he could meet “very soon” with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, to discuss ending the war in Ukraine.\n\n• Trump’s limousine, known as “the Beast”, led Daytona 500 drivers on two laps around the Florida racetrack. “This is your favorite president,” he told them. “I’m a big fan. I am a really big fan of you people.”\n\n15 February 2025\n\nTrump went on social media to signal continued resistance to limits on his executive authority in the face of multiple legal challenges. “He who saves his Country does not violate any Law,” the president wrote on his Truth Social network. The phrase, attributed to Napoleon, the French military leader who eventually declared himself emperor, drew immediate criticism from Democrats. “Spoken like a true dictator,” Senator Adam Schiff of California, a longtime adversary of Trump, wrote on X.\n\nAlso on Saturday:\n\n• The US envoy to Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, told a global security conference in Munich that the US would act as an intermediary in talks with Ukraine and Russia. Asked about the prospects of the Europeans being at the table, Kellogg said: “I’m [from] a school of realism. I think that’s not gonna happen.”\n\n14 February 2025\n\nJD Vance, the vice-president, stunned the Munich security conference by accusing European leaders of suppressing free speech, failing to halt illegal migration and running in fear from voters’ true beliefs. Vance suggested that Europe was infected by media censorship, cancelled elections and political correctness.\n\n“The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia, it’s not China, it’s not any other external actor,” the vice-president said. “And what I worry about is the threat from within, the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values.” The blistering remarks were condemned by the European Union and Germany but drew praise from Russian state television.\n\nAlso on Friday:\n\n• Members of Elon Musk’s “department of government efficiency” arrived at the Pentagon in what appeared to be their first meeting with defense department staff.\n\n• Under pressure from Trump’s justice department leadership, prosecutors in Washington asked a federal judge to drop bribery and fraud charges against the New York mayor, Eric Adams, rather than see the entire public integrity office be fired.\n\n• The White House said it would ban the Associated Press from events in the Oval Office and Air Force One over the news agency’s refusal to obey Trump’s executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the Gulf of America.\n\n13 February 2025\n\nTrump unveiled plans for the US to implement “reciprocal” tariffs on all countries with which it conducts trade. “They charge us a tax or tariff and we charge them the exact same,” he told reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nSigning a memorandum called the “Fair and Reciprocal Plan”, the president admitted the tariffs could cause Americans some “some short-term disturbance”, adding: “Prices could go up somewhat short-term. But prices will also go down.”\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\n• The Senate voted 52–48 to confirm the longtime vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr as the next health and human services secretary. Senator Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor, was the only Republican to join all Democrats in opposition, saying he “will not condone the relitigation of proven cures”.\n\n• Trump was equivocal when asked what concessions Russia should be willing to make to secure a peace deal in Ukraine. He told reporters at a press conference: “It’s too early to say what’s going to happen. Maybe Russia will give up a lot. Maybe they won’t. It’s all dependent on what is going to happen.”\n\n• Danielle Sassoon, the acting US attorney for the southern district of New York, quit after the justice department ordered her to drop the corruption case against the New York City mayor, Eric Adams. Several other justice department officials also resigned after they were ordered to drop the case.\n\n12 February 2025\n\nTrump held separate phone calls with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, and Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, in an effort to end the war that has raged for three years. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, told reporters at a briefing: “They were very good calls. They were very positive.”\n\nLater Trump told reporters he expected to come face to face with Putin soon. “We ultimately expect to meet,” he said in the Oval Office. “In fact, we expect that he’ll come here, and I’ll go there, and we’re going to meet also, probably in Saudi Arabia. The first time we’ll meet in Saudi Arabia.”\n\nAlso on Wednesday:\n\n• The Senate confirmed the former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard in a 52–48 vote to serve as director of national intelligence. Senator Mitch McConnell, the former Senate leader, was the lone Republican to join all Democrats in opposition.\n\n• The Senate budget committee voted 11–10 to approve a budget reconciliation bill intended to serve as a blueprint to get Trump’s border, energy and military agenda through Congress.\n\n• Inflation rose to 3% on an annual basis in January, an increase from 2.9% in December, according to the latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\n11 February 2025\n\nJoined by his four-year-old son X in the Oval Office, Elon Musk claimed the ”department of government efficiency’s” (Doge) goal was to “restore democracy”, contending that the federal bureaucracy had amassed too much power.\n\nThe world’s richest man denied conflicts of interest. “You can see whether I’m doing something that’s benefiting one of my companies or not,” he told reporters. “I’ll be scrutinised nonstop.” Trump signed an executive order that seeks to “significantly reduce the size of government” by instructing agencies to undertake plans for “large-scale reductions in force”.\n\nAlso on Tuesday:\n\n• Trump stood by his plan for the US to take control of Gaza and redevelop it as a tourist destination while relocating 2 million Palestinians. During a meeting with Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Trump told reporters: “We’re going to take it. We’re going to hold it. We’re going to cherish it.”\n\n• The White House secured the release of Marc Fogel, an American teacher who had been imprisoned in Russia. The US released Alexander Vinnik, a Russian cybercriminal who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering, in exchange.\n\n• Trump claimed that he would abide by court decisions curbing his administration’s actions amid growing fears of a constitutional crisis following Vance’s assertion that “judges aren’t allowed to control the executive’s legitimate power.”\n\n10 February 2025\n\nTrump signed an order to impose 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports to the US while eliminating all country exceptions. He said: “It’s a big deal. This is the beginning of making America rich again.”\n\nThe chief executive of Ford, Jim Farley, said while he believed the president aimed to strengthen the US car industry overall, the tariff plans had “a lot of cost and a lot of chaos”. The move was also criticised by Canada, Mexico and other trading partners.\n\nAlso on Monday:\n\n• The justice department ordered federal prosecutors to drop corruption charges against the New York mayor, Eric Adams, arguing that the case was interfering with the mayor’s ability to aid the president’s crackdown on illegal immigration.\n\n• Asked whether he saw Vice-President JD Vance as his automatic successor in 2028, Trump told Fox News: “No, but he’s very capable. I mean, I don’t think that it, you know – I think you have a lot of very capable people. So far, I think he’s doing a fantastic job. It’s too early. We’re just starting.”\n\n9 February 2025\n\nDonald Trump defended Elon Musk, head of the “department of government efficiency”, amid criticism of the billionaire’s slash-and-burn tactics at agencies such as USAid. “He’s not gaining anything. In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it,” Trump told Fox News in an interview taped ahead of the Super Bowl.\n\nTrump also predicted Musk would find “billions” of dollars of abuse and fraud in the federal government. “I’m going to tell him very soon, like maybe in 24 hours, to go check the Department of Education ... Then I’m going to go, go to the military. Let’s check the military,” Trump said. “We’re going to find billions, hundreds of millions of dollars of fraud and abuse.”\n\nAlso on Sunday:\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Air Force One as he flew to New Orleans for the Super Bowl, Trump said he would impose new 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the US.Trump also declared Sunday to be “Gulf of America Day”, the latest step in his effort to rename the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n8 February 2025\n\nIn an interview with the New York Post, Donald Trump announced he would revoke the security clearances of more top Democrats, including Joe Biden’s former secretary of state, Antony Blinken, and the New York attorney general, Letitia James. “Bad guy. Take away his passes,” Trump said of Blinken. He added: “This is to take away every right they have [revoking security clearances] including they can’t go into [federal] buildings.”\n\nAlso on Saturday:\n\nRuss Vought, Trump’s new director of the office of management and budget, announced he had cut off the budget of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\n7 February 2025\n\nDonald Trump moved to revoke Joe Biden’s security clearance and end the former president’s daily intelligence briefings as retaliation for Biden doing the same to him in 2021. Biden indicated he would end his predecessor’s intelligence briefings after the House impeached Trump for inciting the January 6 attack on the US Capitol.\n\nAlso on Friday:\n\nTrump halted a key piece of his proposed tariffs against China.A federal judge blocked Trump from placing thousands of USAid employees on leave, dealing a blow to the president’s efforts to dismantle the agency.Trump announced he would appoint himself chair of the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and fire multiple members of its board of trustees. A spokesperson for the Kennedy Center said it had “received no official communications from the White House regarding changes to our board of trustees”.Trump signed an executive order to cut financial assistance to South Africa due to “unjust racial discrimination” against white Afrikaners, as he offered them asylum in the US.\n\n6 February 2025\n\nA federal judge temporarily blocked a deadline for government employees to decide whether to take a buyout offer as legal challenges play out. The deadline, which was initially set at 6 February at 11.59pm ET, was extended to at least Monday to allow parties to file legal briefings in a lawsuit over the policy.\n\nAlso on Thursday:\n\nThe US Senate voted along party lines to confirm Russell Vought, a key architect of Project 2025, as the new director of the office of management and budget.Trump called for the “termination” of 60 Minutes in the latest escalation of his fight against the US media, writing in a Truth Social post: “CBS should lose its license, and the cheaters at 60 Minutes should all be thrown out, and this disreputable ‘NEWS’ show should be immediately terminated.”\n\n5 February 20","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/tracking-trump-updates-presidency-first-144150186.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/d21540c92a1bf382a74819e7f11a7009","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 12:06:21","author":"Hugo Lowell, Joan E Greve, Joseph Gedeon, David Smith And Robert Tait In Washington And Rachel Leing","authors":["Hugo Lowell, Joan E Greve, Joseph Gedeon, David Smith And Robert Tait In Washington And Rachel Leing"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.241},{"id":308561730,"title":"JP Morgan chief issues recession and stagflation warning over Trump tariffs","text":"JP Morgan chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon has warned that severe curbs on trade imposed by President Donald Trump could lead the US economy towards recession and stagflation.\n\nDimon made the comments ahead of the multinational investment bank’s financial results, reporting revenue of $180.6bn and net income of $58.5bn in 2024. \n\nHe credited the bank with playing “a forceful and essential role in advancing economic growth.”\n\nWriting in the banking giant’s annual report, Dimon said: “The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession. \n\n“And even with the recent decline in market values, prices remain relatively high.

I'm more deeply concerned with a federal government that threatens universities if they don't give up students who are exercising their right to free speech.\n\n\"I am more troubled by the idea that a White House can say to law firms, 'If you represent parties that we don't like, we're going to pull all our business or bar you from representing people effectively.'

In November voters are set to choose a governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and house of delegates. The election will be a bellwether not only for Trump’s presidency but tech billionaire Musk’s unofficial “department of government efficiency”, or Doge, which has hit Virginia hard because of its proximity to the federal government.\n\n“It is his work and efforts that are going to be litigated in this election,” said Heather Williams, the president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), which focuses on building power at state level. “We see the Doge efforts take on a local spin, meaning they’re not just talking about the machete that he wielded without any care or concern but the very real local impact and how it is affecting individuals.”\n\nRepublican victories in last year’s elections for the White House and both chambers of Congress plunged Democrats into recriminations and soul searching. An NBC poll last month found that just 27% of registered voters have positive views of the party, its lowest rating since the question was first asked in 1990. Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, recently described the Democratic brand as “toxic”.\n\nBut the party’s favoured candidate, Susan Crawford, overcame $25m in spending from Musk last week to defeat a conservative opponent for a seat on Wisconsin’s state supreme court. Democrats also slashed Republicans’ margins in two ruby red congressional districts in Florida, while in Washington DC, Senator Cory Booker delivered an epic 25-hour speech that suggested a party rediscovering its mojo.\n\nDemocrats see state legislators as crucial in pushing back against harmful policies emanating from the White House and have been thriving in special elections so far this year. They have defended majorities in five chambers and over-performed by 10 points on average, flipping two districts that Trump won by double digits.\n\nOn Monday the DLCC will attempt to build on the momentum by launching a Roadmap to Victory in Virginia memo, including a list of target races in November and an ongoing seven-figure investment in the house of delegates, where Democrats have a narrow 51-49 majority.\n\nUnusually, the DLCC is also adding the highly consequential lieutenant governor’s race to its target map to secure the ability to win tie-breaking votes in the state senate, where Democrats currently have a one-seat margin.\n\nThe memo describes legislative Democrats in Virginia as being on the frontlines responding to Trump’s chaos and havoc, while Republicans such as the governor, Glenn Youngkin, expressed support for Doge cuts. State Republicans unanimously voted against a constitutional amendment to protect abortion access and voted nearly entirely in lockstep against a ban on assault weapons.\n\nDemocrats claim to be seeing mounting enthusiasm and have launched campaigns in 97 of 100 districts, whereas Republicans have recruited candidates for just 63 districts. The memo observes: “Opportunities to move policy and build power aren’t happening in Washington – they’re happening in the statehouses.”\n\nYoungkin is ineligible to run in November because Virginia bars governors from seeking consecutive terms in office. Instead Winsome Earle-Sears, the current lieutenant governor, will be the Republican nominee in the gubernatorial race while Abigail Spanberger is the presumptive nominee for the Democrats.\n\nWilliams said: “Democrats have been winning elections again. Voters made it clear in 2024 that their issues were around the economy and affordability and economic opportunity, and they asked their elected officials to pay attention to that.\n\n“What we are seeing in these election results is an understanding that Republicans are unfocused and harming communities when they needed support and government to work on their behalf. Voters are not standing for it.”\n\nThe DLCC advocates a back-to-basics approach of grassroots organising and face-to-face conversations with voters, addressing issues such as housing, US healthcare prices and wages. Williams said: “You’ve got Democrats in the legislature or candidates who are putting forth agendas around the economy and affordability and trying to address the very real, honest issues that Americans are dealing with.”\n\nLast week’s election results were ominous for Republicans in Virginia, a state that Democrat Kamala Harris won by six percentage points. Trump’s slashing of the federal government, chaotic tariffs and threats to social security could galvanise Democrats while turning off independent and moderate Republicans.\n\nWilliams commented: “Yes, Trump is responsible for this, Elon Musk is responsible for this, but local Republicans are also complicit. They are falling in line with a reckless approach to government and a reckless political party with Donald Trump at the helm. They don’t get off the hook.”\n\nMusk burst onto the political stage last year, spending nearly $300m supporting Trump and other Republican campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission filings. On Wednesday, the world’s richest person donned a cheesehead hat and gave out $1m cheques to two Wisconsin voters, declaring them spokespeople for his political group and claiming that the supreme court election was vital to “the future of civilisation”.\n\nBut conservative favorite Brad Schimel’s 10-point defeat implied that Musk could become an albatross around Republicans’ necks. Gleeful Democrats pleaded for him to come to their districts and campaign for their Republican opponents in next year’s midterms. Wisconsin congressman Mark Pocan told the Axios website: “I’ll pay for his coach flight.”\n\nMusk’s indiscriminate and unconstitutional assault on the government has had an outsized impact on Virginia, which is home to thousands of federal workers who commute to Washington as well as some key military bases.\n\nWilliams observed: “Government is very present in Virginia and it has served them historically well. You’ve got hard workers doing good things, protecting our country, and they’re being tossed around as if nothing matters and that is going to have a big impact.”\n\nBut having become addicted to Musk’s patronage, Republicans will struggle to untether themselves. “He committed to buy elections and he’s not getting out of that because Republicans are going to need money to save themselves in these races.\n\n“They’re going to be up against voters who are unwilling to be bought or have that level of assumption about what can move them. Musk is going to be a part of this. Republicans are going to need his resources and we’re going to continue to hear about this all election cycle.”\n\nDon Scott, a Democrat who last year became the first Black speaker in the Virginia house of delegates’ 400-year history, agrees that Musk will continue to cast a long shadow.\n\n“I think Republicans are begging him to come to Virginia because they have not gotten the memo from Wisconsin and Florida and Pennsylvania that voters don’t like the policies,” he said. “Because they haven’t gotten the memo yet, they continue to embrace him and they will not tell him to go away because he’s out of touch. They’re going to find out, I believe, in November how out of touch they are in Virginia.”\n\nScott noted that whereas Democrats in Washington are shut out of power, their counterparts in the Virginia house of delegates passed resolutions in January enshrining rights to abortion, voting and marriage equality.\n\n“We’ve got to stop whining,” the speaker said. “There’s no whining in this state. There’s no need to do any handwringing. You don’t get to have a pity party. If you really believe that this is an existential threat, do the work. We have to continue to show folks how we deliver, what values we stand for. Our values are not losing.\n\n“That’s why I’m tired of people talking about the message. We don’t need a hero. We don’t need someone to come in with a cape. Get over Michelle Obama and Barack Obama. We need every day normal Americans to come to the forefront.”\n\nScott added: “Virginians know exactly who Donald Trump is and we’ll have the opportunity to be the canary in the coal mine for the rest of the country here in November. We’ll be sending a message of hope to the rest of the country that we haven’t been snowed by this guy.”","summary":"Democrats in the state view themselves as on the frontlines responding to Donald Trump’s harmful policies\n\nDemocrats have begun plotting the next phase of their electoral revival with a seven-figure spend in Virginia ahead of a vote they hope will turn into a referendum on Elon Musk.\n\nThe party, which had been despondent since Donald Trump’s victory last year, got off the canvas last week with a convincing win in a Wisconsin supreme court race and two strong congressional performances in Florida.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/07/virginia-elections-backlash-elon-musk-trump-democrats","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/96710b59c5d7f71b312963d251f7d4694f62cf0d/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 11:00:17","author":"David Smith","authors":["David Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.064},{"id":308547186,"title":"Global markets plunge due to trade war.

Asian and European markets plunged overnight, and in the U.S., economists say the odds of a recession have increased. The investment bank Goldman Sachs says the U.S. recession is close to 50-50 odds, assuming Trump won't go through with his plan for the biggest tariffs to go into effect on Wednesday. If those tariffs hit, the bank predicts a recession.\n\n🎧 Trump calls the tariffs \"medicine,\" while almost everyone else warns they are bad for consumers, investors, businesses, and the global economy, NPR's Maria Aspan tells Up First. Even if the U.S. and the world are not pushed into a recession, the current market selloff could have real consequences for most consumers. About 60% of U.S. households own stocks. That's where most people have their retirement accounts and other long-term savings invested.➡️ Your grocery trips are likely to become more expensive under Trump's new tariffs, according to economists.

Read the interview highlights here.\n\nA federal judge has ordered the Trump administration to bring back Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, who was mistakenly deported last month to El Salvador. The administration has until midnight to make the return happen. The Justice Department is appealing the judge's order, arguing the court no longer has jurisdiction over the case because Abrego Garcia is in El Salvador. \n\n🎧 Judge Paula Xinis asked the Justice Department's Erez Reuveni, who argued the case on Friday, why the administration didn't try to return Abrego Garcia when they learned of the mistake. He stated he asked the same thing of his clients inside the Trump administration and so far hasn't received an answer he finds satisfactory, NPR's Joel Rose says. The next day, he was put on administrative leave.\n\nA second child has died in Texas due to measles, according to state health officials. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended the 8-year-old child's funeral on Sunday. She has been identified as Daisy Hildebrand. Her death comes as an outbreak centered in Texas reached 481 confirmed cases. Until this year, the U.S. had not reported a measles death for nearly a decade. \n\n🎧 Texas health officials say Hildebrand was not vaccinated and had no reported underlying health conditions, NPR's Maria Godoy reports. She was hospitalized after getting sick with measles and died from measles pulmonary failure, according to doctors. Dr. Adam Ratner, a pediatric infectious disease specialist, says every time a child gets measles, you have a one or two in a thousand chances of them dying. Kennedy stated that vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles. Godoy says the announcement is notable, as Kennedy has previously called vaccines a \"personal choice.\" Trump has downplayed the size of the outbreak but says that if it progresses, the U.S. will have to take very strong action.\n\nThe state of the First Amendment\n\nTrump recently declared during an address to Congress that he had \"stopped all government censorship and brought back free speech in America.\" This week, Morning Edition will explore who feels freer to speak under Trump's administration, who feels they're being forced into silence and the extent to which the Constitutional right to free speech might be changing — for the better or worse.\n\nby Leila Fadel, Morning Edition and Up First host\n\nWe've been talking to Americans across the country who are worried they may be losing a fundamental right: the right to free speech.\n\nSo, we decided to ask the questions: Who feels silenced? Who feels more free to speak? And are the protections of the First Amendment, enshrined in the Constitution, fading?\n\nWe'll explore this in our series airing this week on Morning Edition: The State of The First Amendment, The Right From Which All Rights Flow.\n\nYou will hear from scientists, educators, activists from the left and far right, college Republicans, immigration attorneys and more. We also asked you, our listeners and readers, to share how you are feeling in this moment.\n\nAt times, you will hear hate speech. In other moments, you will hear from fellow Americans you agree with — and those you do not.\n\nAs we begin our series today, I want to share something that struck me and the Morning Edition team the most as we examined the state of free speech in the United States. There is a chilling of what some Americans feel safe to say.\n\nIn one interview after the next, people asked us to obscure their full names or not record at all. Their reasons came down to fear: fear of retribution, fear at the border and fear of government retribution.\n\nBut there were also Americans who now feel safer to be loud and bold.\n\nIn order to understand what's happening today, we start this morning by turning to two of the foremost scholars on the First Amendment and free speech.\n\nLee Bollinger and Jonathan Turley have different perspectives, and you will hear that. But what we understood from our conversations is that when it comes to this basic American right, those across the ideological spectrum find much more common ground than differences.\n\nListen and read our stories here.\n\nPicture show\n\nThousands of people participated in the Hands Off! demonstrations across the U.S. on Saturday to protest President Trump and Elon Musk's actions. Marchers addressed cuts and layoffs in federal departments, mass deportations and more. More than 150 groups organized protests in more than 1,200 locations across 50 states.

In 2024, pre-election polls showed that about 61 percent of them supported Donald Trump, while just 37 percent supported Kamala Harris. In the past, this made some sense, as Republicans traditionally have showered money and benefits on the military, despite the fact that the Pentagon and the Veterans Affairs Department constitute the only fully socialized, cradle-to-grave welfare system in this country. The bargain has gone like this: Give the government several years of your life, potentially putting life and limb at risk, and you will get access to a European-style welfare state.\n\nBut this time is different. Trump, together with Elon Musk and his DOGE goons, are carrying out sweeping attacks on veterans and soldiers alike, from active-duty troops, to veterans who receive a wide range of benefits, to the hundreds of thousands of veterans in the federal workforce.\n\nProbably the most directly impactful cuts are the ones to the VA, particularly research and treatment. As Suzanne Gordon and Steve Early have covered here at the Prospect, the VA has a scientific arm that has developed dozens of medical innovations useful not just to veterans, but all people. Agency scientists were central to the development of advanced prosthetic limbs, the cardiac pacemaker, the liver transplant, the CAT scan, and dozens of important medications.\n\nGreat chunks of that scientific apparatus are being ripped out, more or less at random. Hundreds of researchers have been fired and hundreds of studies, including clinical trials, have been halted. “Over 10,000 veterans may have their medical care affected immediately because of this assault on VA research, the National Association of Veterans’ Research and Education Foundations tells the Prospect,” Gordon and Early write. A lot of veterans, and likely ordinary citizens too, are going to die because of this.\n\nThousands of VA staff have already been canned, and more than 80,000 layoffs are planned for coming months. As Gordon and Early detail in another piece, Trump’s VA chief Doug Collins is cutting contracts not with abusive monopolists who rip off the agency, but others providing basic services. The quality and accessibility of veterans’ care will suffer. Even the VA’s suicide hotline is not immune, as perhaps two-thirds of the people staffing it will not be able to comply with Trump’s order ending work-from-home policies.\n\nTrump and Musk are also coming for veterans’ homes. As NPR explains, back in 2023 the VA abruptly canceled a pandemic relief program that allowed veterans to stop making payments for up to six months, which is forcing borrowers to make up the missed payments all at once. Up to 40,000 veterans faced foreclosure. In response, the agency set up a mortgage assistance program, called VASP, that’s similar to the New Deal Home Owners’ Loan Corporation, which bought up distressed mortgages and negotiated new terms within borrowers’ ability to pay. More than 17,000 veterans are now enrolled in this program.\n\nBut now Trump is axing that program before even half the affected population is enrolled, and possibly ending it for the veterans already enrolled in it. In this, he has the support of House Republicans. “The Trump administration rightfully put an end to VA’s VASP program,” said a joint statement from Reps. Derrick Van Orden (R-WI) and Mike Bost (R-IL), the chair of the House Committee on Veterans’ Affairs.\n\nIt’s not just veterans, either. Back in February, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth said he wanted an 8 percent annual reduction in the military budget for each of the next five years, which will likely add up to a roughly 50 percent total cut in inflation-adjusted terms at least. (Completely deleting the Navy would not even come close to reductions on that scale.) As Military.com reports, these proposed cuts may be why the Army is considering sacking 90,000 active-duty troops.\n\nFinally, we have Trump and Musk’s all-out assault on federal government workers and their unions. About 30 percent of federal workers are veterans, thanks to numerous initiatives to give them priority access to federal jobs. Ironically, these job placement programs and protections constituted a large fraction of the DEI initiatives at federal agencies—the ones that Trump has been canceling wholesale, as he has with the contracts with almost every federal workers’ union. It’s a safe bet that veterans will make up a similarly disproportionate share of those laid off.\n\nIt would be a mistake, of course, to think that George W. Bush was all that concerned with the lives of American soldiers, given how many he got killed by starting a disastrous war of aggression in Iraq. As Kurt Vonnegut (a Second World War veteran himself) wrote, “They are being treated, as I never was, like toys a rich kid got for Christmas.” But at least Bush and his other Republicans pretended to care. That manifested in support for the VA and other programs.\n\nTrump can’t even do that. To him, troops aren’t even toys. Recently in Lithuania, four American soldiers were killed in an apparent training accident. Before their remains were shipped back home, they were honored at an elaborate ceremony attended by the Lithuanian president, along with the country’s top generals and religious leaders. But Trump declined to attend the “dignified transfer” procedure when the bodies arrived back on U.S. soil, because he was at a Saudi golf tournament in Florida.","summary":"The administration is vindictively hacking away at veterans’ benefits.","url":"https://prospect.org/health/2025-04-07-mad-king-trumps-war-on-the-troops/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22728/download/Cooper-Veterans%20cuts%20040725.jpg?cb=7311ec734fa7d5228c0a06e91647de87&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 09:15:00","author":"Ryan Cooper","authors":["Ryan Cooper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.481},{"id":308498616,"title":"Teamsters President Sean O’Brien sees tariffs creating jobs for next generation","text":"Boston-bred Teamsters President Sean O’Brien said if the Trump tariffs bring back “good-paying, middle-class jobs,” it’s worth all the pain because it will benefit future generations.\n\nO’Brien, three years in as the head of the 1.3 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters, added that he’s fed up with Democrats who have “lost the working class” and just “sit on the sidelines and throw rocks.”\n\nThe nation needs ideas and a bipartisan government, he said. That’s why he has launched his own podcast — “Better Bad Ideas” — to push back at the soundbite culture and “gotcha” politics.\n\nIt’s a byproduct of the bump he received, and some scorn, for his address at the Republican National Convention last summer that was quickly followed by a very public snub by the Democrats.\n\n“I want to be the face of working people,” O’Brien, 53, told the Herald in the Seaport. “I’m a realist and we have to get real in this country.”\n\nO’Brien stressed he’s “not a politician,” but if someone called floating a vice presidential job — or higher — he wouldn’t hang up the phone. He’s proud of his Teamsters post and said he’s not backing down from the work it will take to help his growing membership.\n\n“We need to find out what we agree on,” he said of D.C. politics. “Why wouldn’t we talk to Republicans? President Trump could cure cancer and the Democrats would still be opposed to him.”\n\nDown on Democrats\n\nO’Brien accused the Democrats of losing the working class and didn’t hold back on his views of U.S. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, saying bluntly: “He should take his pension and retire.”\n\nO’Brien said his “people are not happy with the Democratic party” and a poll the Teamsters included pre-election in the union magazine generated 140,000 responses with then-candidate Trump winning 63.4% to 34% over Vice President Kamala Harris. The rest were undecided.\n\nThat resulted in the Teamsters not endorsing in the race at all, in a shock to the Democratic party.\n\nBut O’Brien said that’s too bad.\n\n“The Democratic party is not the party I grew up in,” he said. “D.C. is treacherous.”\n\nTariffs rolling out\n\nO’Brien said he speaks with Trump “three to four times a month,” with the president saying “he feels he owes it to the working people” to stay connected with those who punch in every day.\n\nThat includes backing the new Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and giving the tariffs a chance because the payoff is just too big.\n\nO’Brien said a four-year college degree no longer guarantees a good job. That’s the hope from the tariffs, with companies setting up in the U.S. instead of heading overseas or to Mexico.\n\n“The short answer is bring back jobs,” O’Brien said of tariffs. “We need a path to careers. Why not?”\n\nThe 25% tariff on Mexican beer, for instance, will help the 80,000-plus brewery workers in the Teamsters in America almost immediately, O’Brien said. His union said this tariff will help set a “standard for dignified living that America workers deserve.”\n\nThat’s just one example, he said, while adding Teamsters in Canada need his backing, too.\n\n“Let’s have a discussion on President Trump’s 101st day in office and let’s assess where we could have been more valuable,” O’Brien said, adding he’s not shying away from responsibility. That day will be at the beginning of May.\n\nPodcast rolling\n\nO’Brien said his podcast is not affiliated with the Teamsters, but he approaches it with the same work ethic and blunt talk.\n\n“It’s an opportunity to showcase what we do as Teamsters,” he said, with episodes featuring actor Casey Affleck, former Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams, and Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley with more on the way via YouTube.\n\nHis podcast partner, and in life, Christine Lynch said it’s a “platform for real conversations with real people.”\n\nWith CNN and MSNBC, O’Brien singled out, giving just “7 minutes” to make a point, it’s impossible to escape being pegged. That’s what he’s shedding as politics remains so polarized.\n\n“We need to find out what we can agree on,” he said. “And I can say exactly what I want, and we can clean up some of this false narrative.”\n\nThis is coming from a leader who heads a union that has $1 billion in assets, with the headquarters in Washington, D.C., 80,000 new members in the past three years under his watch, and a $350 million strike fund. That’s a lot of power to sway the economy.\n\n“I can ask anything I want and the person I have on can answer as long and they want,” he stressed.\n\nA refreshing idea seldom seen in politics these days.","summary":"Boston-bred Teamsters President Sean O'Brien said if the Trump tariffs bring back \"good-paying, middle-class jobs,\" it's worth all the pain because it will benefit future generations.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/07/teamsters-president-sean-obrien-sees-tariffs-creating-jobs-for-next-generation/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/UNIONsc003.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 09:05:50","author":"Joe Dwinell","authors":["Joe Dwinell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.415},{"id":308602628,"title":"Is the anti-Trump ‘resistance’ starting to find its voice again?","text":"For months, Democrats have watched aghast as President Donald Trump has unleashed his head-spinning, all-of-government brand of disruption. Boxed out of federal governing, Democratic voters have bewailed the impotence of their party’s leaders as the Republican administration has dismantled government agencies, claimed wartime powers to deport immigrants – and, last week, imposed an unprecedented level of tariffs that sparked a rout in global financial markets.\n\nLately, that frustration has shown signs of coalescing into something bigger. Testy voters have peppered GOP lawmakers at town halls, and tens of thousands continue to turn out for a barnstorming tour by Sen. Bernie Sanders. Last week, a record 25-hour protest speech by Sen. Cory Booker drew hundreds of millions of likes online.\n\nOn Saturday, disaffected citizens took to the streets. Across the country, from small towns and mid-sized cities to the nation’s capital, voters worried about the future of their democracy voiced their loudest message of opposition yet.\n\nThe rallies, organized by Democrat-aligned nonprofits, attracted crowds estimated in the tens or hundreds of thousands in larger cities. In Boston, around 25,000 showed up on a cold, drizzly day; 20,000 rallied in Atlanta and 30,000 in Chicago. More than 100,000 came out in Washington, D.C., organizers said. Every state reported some kind of protest, big or small.\n\nFor some, Saturday’s protests were cathartic, a show of force and solidarity by progressives who had struggled to pick themselves up from last November’s election defeat. Most attendees appeared to be Democrats who had voted for Mr. Trump’s opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, in that election.\n\nThe kaleidoscope of handmade signs and causes, from immigration and the defense of Ukraine to LGBTQ rights and press freedom, spoke to the range and scope of Mr. Trump’s executive actions since Jan. 20. Many protesters also made clear that political issues were personal to them.\n\nKate Norton, a scientist in the pharmaceutical industry in Colorado, flew to Washington with her husband to join the buoyant crowd that spread across the Mall. “I think our democracy is disappearing. I think the whole way of our American life is changing.” She criticized Mr. Trump’s order to eliminate the Department of Education and shrink the programs it funds. Her son was supported by a federally funded program at his public school, and she worries that other children will lose these benefits. “It’s devastating,” she says.\n\nIn Boston, Harry Lui said the recent death of his mother, who had been treated for dementia, made him want to join the protest. Mr. Lui, who works in customer services for Whole Foods, said he’s upset at the Trump administration’s deep cuts to National Institutes for Health funding. “They cut off the NIH funding for medical research. That affects dementia research,” he says.\n\nWhile Mr. Trump was the main target for protesters, plenty of ire was also directed at Elon Musk, the tech billionaire and GOP donor who has become Mr. Trump’s close adviser.\n\nSome of the New York City rally attendees, whose ranks by mid-afternoon stretched nearly 20 blocks through midtown, swapped stories of joining anti-Tesla protests. Mr. Musk is the CEO of Tesla; its dealerships have been swarmed by protests lately against his role in the administration. His willingness to pour money into Republican races has roiled GOP lawmakers in Congress who fear a primary challenger. But his reach fell short last week in Wisconsin, where a Democrat easily defeated his chosen candidate for a state Supreme Court seat in a high-turnout, off-year vote.\n\nTez Flanaign lives in Westchester, New York, and is a registered independent who voted for a third-party candidate in 2024. He’s shown up for anti-Musk protests at Tesla dealerships. Saturday was another chance to voice his displeasure with Mr. Musk and Mr. Trump, whom he chides for ending support for Ukraine and entering talks with Russia. Ukraine “is fighting for the free world and for democracy,” he says.\n\nSome protesters were animated by economic issues and fears over cuts to social programs such as Medicaid and Social Security. Saturday’s protests were organized in advance of Mr. Trump’s announcement Wednesday that tariffs would be applied to U.S. trading partners. But the cascading market selloffs and the likely impact on voters’ pocketbooks injected another rallying cry into the mix.\n\nTulio Tobar said he’s concerned about the economy and the effects of deportations on his landscaping company. A registered Democrat in Washington, he foresees any economic pain being unequally felt. “He [Trump] has a lot of money. It’s not going to affect him or his millionaire friends. But for us, for the middle and lower classes – it’s going to hurt us a lot,” he says, speaking in Spanish.\n\nIn Boston, Annie Whalen, who owns a gift and floral shop in the Berkshire Mountains, came with her family; it was her first protest. She imports flowers from Canada and frets that Mr. Trump’s tariffs “could ruin our business.” Other products are sourced in China. “They went up 25%. Now they’re up 54%.”\n\nShe had bought 100 postcards and plans to write to every U.S. senator to ask them “to stand up to Trump. To get a backbone.”\n\nIn downtown Los Angeles, thousands gathered on a warm, sunny afternoon to rally and march a mile to City Hall. Protesters took photos of each others’ signs; some children accompanied their parents.\n\nMinnesota native Julia Florey moved to L.A. two years ago. Her past experience working as an attorney and interpreter for separated migrant women and children in Texas informs how she sees the Trump administration’s hardline immigration policy. It’s an experience she can’t forget. To any person who may feel hopeless, “I just want to be an ally and to show my face and to tell them they’re not alone.”\n\nMany Democrats have felt hopeless during a blitzkrieg of a presidency that is testing the limits of constitutional authority, including over the deportations of migrants, halting of congressionally approved spending, and punishment of universities accused of not protecting the rights of Jews during intense spells of pro-Palestinian activism.\n\nTo some, the idea that a protest, even on a national scale, would have any effect on Mr. Trump and Mr. Musk seemed naive. Others insisted that citizens could and should voice their opposition and that staying quiet wasn’t an option. “This is the kind of stuff that can get people energized and wake people up,” says Michael Palmer, a veteran from Whatley, Massachusetts.\n\nWhile stationed in West Germany, Mr. Palmer, who works as a hospital administrator, witnessed the fall of the Berlin Wall and Germans’ hunger for political freedom. He worries that Americans are too complacent and that Democrats are too busy with political strategizing. “Right now, I’m not sure that people on the left should be concentrating so much on the vision for the future as to stop the bleeding now. If we don’t fight tooth and nail to get it [America] back, it’s going to be gone forever.”\n\nOthers spoke of the motivating force of holding public gatherings in a democracy and of the need to show the strength of its defenders. “I really hope that when others who are afraid to speak up see this happening, and they see more and more and more people doing this, they will find the courage to do the same,” says Jennifer Cooper, a performing artist and educator from Maryland who joined the Washington protest.\n\n“Because it’s going to be about numbers. It’s going to be about outnumbering the oppression, so that the folks who are defending a democracy outnumber those who are not.”\n\nWith reporting from staff writers Caitlin Babcock in Washington; Ali Martin in Los Angeles; Cameron Pugh in New York; and Jingnan Peng in Boston.","summary":"Saturday’s protests were a show of force and solidarity for those opposed to President Donald Trump’s policies.

The suddenness — and steepness — of the tariffs announced last Wednesday prompted some global manufacturers to pause shipments to the U.S., and led economists to raise the odds of recession.\n\nBut an earlier set of tariffs still has the support of Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers.\n\nFain supported Democrat Kamala Harris with a fiery convention speech in 2024, and opposes many of Trump's stances on union labor, but contends the president struck a blow that leaders of both parties have resisted for decades.\n\nFain represents nearly a million current and retired workers in multiple industries, of whom he estimates a few hundred thousand are now employed by the auto industry. It's a dramatic decline from the 1.5 million autoworkers alone the UAW represented in the mid-20th century.\n\nBelow are highlights from an NPR interview with an unconventional supporter of the tariffs. Some answers have been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nHe's not sure about all the tariffs but favors those for his industry.\n\nFain referred to last Wednesday's announcement of global tariffs as \"reckless,\" but firmly supports an earlier round of tariffs on the U.S. auto industry. Those tariffs both help and hurt U.S. auto companies, because they produce so much in Canada and Mexico. Auto parts typically cross the border multiple times as a car is assembled. GM has already said it will move some production back to Indiana — but Stellantis ordered layoffs.\n\nFor Fain, tariffs address a historic wrong. \"We've sat here for the last 30 plus years, with the inception of [the North American Free Trade Agreement] back in 1993-94, and watched our manufacturing base in this country disappear,\" he said.\n\nHe doesn't care much about the stock market's decline.\n\n\"You know, half of Americans don't even have stock,\" he said. (Some estimates say well over half of Americans own some stock.)\n\n\"Sixty percent of Americans have no retirement savings,\" he said. \"So when I hear all the crying about the stock market, this is just Wall Street. They're people that are already rich, and at the end of the day, most working class people are trying to survive right now. And it's infuriating that our livelihoods have been stripped from us for decades and no one's cared.\"\n\nHe acknowledges that tariffs may raise prices.\n\nMost economists have said that the cost of import taxes is passed on to consumers. Asked if that is good for the working class, Fain replied, \"Well, no, but that's a choice. This is the problem with our system. It's so upside down. The billionaire class and the corporate class, they always get their profits. They always take their cut, and they always pass anything bad on to consumers.\"\n\nFain nonetheless acknowledged that he sees tariffs as a way to prevent exceptionally low prices driven by cheap labor: \"The point of tariffs is to eliminate the race to the bottom where we're exploiting people.\"\n\nDespite the suddenness of Trump's move, he insists the auto industry can adjust.\n\nFain was calling from Warren, Mich., from which Stellantis recently shifted some production to Mexico. \"There's 2,000 workers that got laid off. They could put them back to work in a month and be building Ram trucks back there,\" he added.\n\nHe dismisses the idea that the disruption may not work out\n\nFain rejected Wall Street warnings of a recession, including one by a JP Morgan economist. \n\n\"Where was JPMorgan, all these people, when the companies were jacking up prices and price gouging the last three and four years?\" he said. \"Where was their outcry then? As long as the stock market's doing good, that's all they care about.\"\n\nHe also minimized an idea advanced by many economists: that any factories \"reshored\" to the U.S. are likely to be highly automated, because of the advances in robotics and the high cost of labor. He said such factories would at least require \"skilled trade jobs which are even better paying jobs. We just have to train people.\"\n\n\"The sad reality of this is [the idea that] it's a bad thing that we put manufacturing back in this country because labor is expensive. That is pathetic. I believe it was one of the former presidents [who] said, I pity the businessman that wants to make a coat so cheap that the person making the coat will starve in the process. I mean, that is sad,\" Fain said.\n\nThe audio version of this interview was produced by Mansee Khurana and edited by Arezou Rezvani.

Despite earning $16 million a year, he pays the same amount, $9,000 in Social Security tax as someone earning $160,000. That, he says, is fundamentally unfair.\n\nGalloway is a vocal supporter of means-testing. That is a process that would determine Social Security eligibility based on income and assets. He believes the benefits should be reserved for those who truly depend on them, not high earners like himself.\n\n“Most people take out two to three times what they put in,” he said, questioning whether someone of his financial standing should be eligible for benefits at all. “The money should be used to support those who genuinely need it.”\n\nHe also criticized how little the ultra-wealthy contribute to funding the program. “I pay $9,000 in Social Security taxes each year, which is the same amount paid by someone with an annual income of $160,000,” he said.\n\nGalloway’s statement comes at a time when Americans are very anxious about the future of Social Security. The Social Security Administration (SSA) projects its trust funds could be depleted by 2033, which could lead to beneficiaries receiving only about 80% of expected payments if no legislative action is taken.\n\nBut Galloway doesn’t believe the system is actually at risk.\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-FL) wants to force retirees back into the workforce.\nOur Executive Director Alex Lawson tells him hell no. Let’s make billionaires pay their fair share into Social Security instead! pic.twitter.com/hLIuOAvwAs\n— Social Security Works (@SSWorks) January 29, 2025\n\n“Old people keep living longer, and they vote, so we’re more likely to get rid of schools, the space program, and half the Navy before we fail to fund Social Security,” he wrote in his book The Algebra of Wealth.\n\nInstead, he’s encouraging Americans to think bigger and much earlier about achieving financial independence.\n\n“I want you to obtain economic security before you stop working,” Galloway wrote. “The sooner the better.”\n\nHe gives a picture of what’s possible. “You could apply the principles of this book and, with some luck and a lot of hard work, be living on a boat in the Caribbean by age 40, never earning another dollar,” he wrote.\n\nIn The Algebra of Wealth, Galloway lays out a framework for financial security built around what he calls a person’s “burn rate”; the amount of money you spend annually.\n\nToday in every state across our nation, Americans are standing up to the administration as they implement Project 2025 at full speed.\nThank you for using your voices and the power of protest to stand for Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid; for the Department of Education…\n— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) April 5, 2025\n\n“Once you’ve achieved economic security, you may decide to continue to focus on work and professional achievement. I have,” he wrote. “But the stress surrounding work declines dramatically when it becomes a surfboard instead of a life preserver. We perform better when we are confident.”\n\nTo determine financial security, he asks people to compare their passive income to their burn rate. If passive income exceeds it, you’ve made it.\n\nGalloway explains the process simply:\n\n“Rough out your projected expenses for a year and add them up. Bump it 20% to cover taxes (30% if you expect to live in California, New York, or another high-tax state). That’s your annual burn rate.\nNow multiply that burn rate by 25. That’s (roughly) your number — the asset base you need to generate passive income greater than your burn. Why 25? That assumes your assets produce income at a rate of 4% over inflation. Different financial planners will suggest slightly different numbers, but 4% is in the ballpark, and 25x makes the math easy.\nThis is just a rough sketch. Our tax estimate is simplistic. Your burn rate will rise if you have kids in the house and fall when they move on.\nBut any work of art starts with a rough sketch. If you need $80,000 a year to cover your burn rate, then $2 million is your number. If you hit that in invested assets, then you win — you’ve beaten capitalism.”\n\nLooks like, Galloway’s message is clear. Don’t wait for retirement, plan for economic freedom now.","summary":"Scott Galloway Sends Strong Message on Social Security Amid Retirement Debate.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/scott-galloway-sends-a-strong-message-on-social-security-calls-for-wealth-exclusion","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Scott-Galloway-has-a-Strong-Message-on-Social-Security.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-07 03:57:14","author":"Mohar Battacharjee","authors":["Mohar Battacharjee"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.002}]}
