How do you explain that to people?” he asked, adding that DOGE’s use of artificial intelligence (AI) is a powerful means of bringing transparency to government spending.\n\n“It feels like the people criticizing Elon don’t want it to happen. And this is going to destroy those people,” Karp said.\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), a frequent participant in protests against DOGE, told The Epoch Times that engagement between progressive Democrats and Musk is difficult because “it’s hard to engage with an oligarch who’s trying to tear apart our democracy.”\n\n“There’s just a host of conflicts of interest that ought to deeply trouble progressives,” Blumenthal said of Musk’s effort, citing possible access to data of Musk’s business competitors.\n\nYet, Blumenthal said, he would be glad to speak with Karp, “or anyone else.”\n\nKarp, a self-described socialist with a Ph.D. in philosophy, has donated tens of thousands to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. His money has also backed various individual Democrats, including Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.) and Rep. Jason Crow (D-Colo.).\n\nIn recent years, he has stepped up his donations to the GOP, including to Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.), President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nKarp said a turning point for him was Hamas’s Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel, the latest massive escalation in a decades-long tit-for-tat between that state and Palestinian leadership.\n\nSeveral months into the conflict, he flew his company’s board to Israel in a show of support. The firm maintains an office in that country.\n\nKarp, who is Jewish, took other tech leaders to task for failing to back Israel in as public a way as he had.\n\n“I think so few people speak out because they believe they can skirt by with no opinion, but there is no one who doesn’t have an opinion on Israel, especially if you are a big company,” the tech CEO said at the time.\n\nIn the months leading up to the 2024 election, Karp said he would be “voting against Trump” despite his reservations with Democrats, backing the candidacies of both former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nOther tech leaders have backed away from the party that found ready allies in Silicon Valley during President Barack Obama’s administration.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg donated to Trump’s inaugural fund and, on a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, said that the Biden administration pressured Facebook to censor COVID-19-related content.\n\nThe Epoch Times has also reached out to Rep. Jared Moskowitz (D-Fla.) a Democrat on the House DOGE Caucus, for comment on Karp’s remarks.","summary":"‘This is going to destroy those people,’ Alex Karp says of DOGE opponents.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/palantir-ceo-criticizes-democrats-resistance-to-doge-5812338","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2023/09/14/id5491884-musk-ai-GettyImages-1678319113-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-19 00:14:47","author":"Nathan Worcester","authors":["Nathan Worcester"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.364},{"id":291931024,"title":"The resignation decision tree: From the Politics Desk","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the White House, Capitol Hill and the campaign trail. We hope you enjoyed your federal holiday on Monday. Today, we’ve got the latest on how orders from President Donald Trump’s appointees are cleaving off career government officials who are uneasy about carrying them out. Plus, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul faces political peril and political opportunity over the question of what to do about New York City Mayor Eric Adams. — Scott Bland Veteran federal prosecutor resigns over bank freeze order from Trump appointee Another Justice Department resignation on Tuesday continued a theme in President Donald Trump’s second administration: concern over orders coming from the top. A veteran prosecutor in the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office wrote in her resignation letter that she’d been asked by superiors to take actions — specifically, telling a bank there was probable cause to seize assets under potential investigation — that she saw as unsupported by evidence, Ryan J. Reilly reported. “As I shared with you, at this juncture, based upon the evidence I have reviewed, I still do not believe that there is sufficient evidence to issue the letter you described, including sufficient evidence to tell the bank that there is probable cause to seize the particular accounts identified,” Denise Cheung, a 24-year Justice Department prosecutor who was the chief of the criminal division at the U.S. Attorney’s Office, wrote in the letter to Interim U.S. Attorney Ed Martin, a Trump appointee. “Because I believed that I lacked the legal authority to issue such a letter, I told you that I would not do so. You then asked for my resignation,” Cheung wrote. The Justice Department responded via a spokesperson that “refusing a basic request to pause an investigation so officials can examine the potential waste of government funds is not an act of heroism — just a failure to follow chain of command.” It’s the latest in a string of departures from the Justice Department stemming from concerns about orders. Last week, the U.S. Attorney’s Office handling the case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams and the Public Integrity section at the Justice Department in Washington saw a round of resignations, as attorneys refused to comply with acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove’s orders to dismiss the charges against Adams. What to know from the Trump presidency today Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that the U.S. and Russia had agreed to re-establish “the functionality of our respective missions in Washington and Moscow,” as top officials from the countries met in Saudi Arabia building toward talks over ending the war in Ukraine.Trump appeared to blame Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy for the Russian invasion of his country in 2022. “Today I heard, ‘Oh, well, we weren’t invited,’” Trump said of Ukrainian concern about U.S.-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia. “Well, you’ve been there for three years. You should have ended it — three years. You should have never started it.”Trump signed two executive orders and a presidential memorandum. One order, on in-vitro fertilization, directs White House advisers to study how to make IVF and other fertility treatments more affordable, while the other directs the Office of Management and Budget to take on a stronger “oversight” role of independent agencies in the executive branch.The memorandum directs “the heads of executive departments and agencies to take all appropriate actions to make public” details of the “waste, fraud and abuse” that the Trump administration is uncovering. Follow live updates → Kathy Hochul's political dilemma over Eric Adams By Steve Kornacki New York Gov. Kathy Hochul is in a politically dangerous moment as she considers what to do about New York City Mayor Eric Adams. A decision to remove the mayor from office would mark the first time a New York governor has ever exercised this power. It would spark a furious outcry from Adams and his backers, who are now seeking to rally support from Black voters — a group that helped propel Adams to office in 2021. And it would risk a broader backlash from Black leaders who might object to the removal of a duly elected Black mayor by a unilateral action. Alienating Black voters would threaten Hochul’s standing in her own potential Democratic primary next year, in which 20% to 25% of the electorate will be Black. But there may also be a significant political opportunity for Hochul here. First, it’s actually uncertain whether a move against Adams would incur this kind of blowback, with recent polling showing Adams broadly unpopular among New York City voters — including Black voters. The numbers could shift if Hochul actually goes through with ousting Adams, but right now, there’s not much residual goodwill toward the mayor among what had been his political base. Moreover, Hochul’s 2026 challenges extend well beyond the Democratic Party, and taking decisive action against an unpopular figure like Adams could give her a badly needed boost among general election swing voters. In 2022, Hochul scored a decidedly underwhelming victory, beating her Republican foe, then-Rep. Lee Zeldin, by just 6 points — two years after Joe Biden carried New York by 23 points. Then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo also won the state by 23 points in 2018. Hochul’s position hasn’t improved since 2022. A Siena College poll two weeks ago showed her with a 44% job approval rating and upside-down personal popularity (39% favorable, 47% unfavorable). Already, a potentially formidable Republican candidate, Rep. Mike Lawler, is laying the groundwork for a campaign against her next year. One way of measuring Hochul’s weakness is to compare the results of three recent elections in New York: the Biden landslide in 2020; Hochul’s much narrower win in 2022; and Kamala Harris’ surprisingly modest (11 points) victory last November. Here are the results from New York’s seven largest counties. A major story in New York last November was the shift of Hispanic, Asian American and some Jewish voters toward Donald Trump. This can be seen in the numbers for the New York City boroughs of Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens and the Bronx, where Harris badly underperformed compared to Biden’s 2020 showing. Notably, though, outside of the Bronx, Hochul also experienced the same decline in 2022. What stands out here are the three counties where Hochul’s drop-off from Biden was far worse than Harris’: Westchester, Nassau and Suffolk. All three of these counties are majority-white, with large suburban swaths. And in all three, the share of the white population with a college degree is at or above the statewide average. Both in New York and nationally, this demographic — white suburbanites with college degrees — has been the most dug in against Trump. But the results suggest that a chunk of them were willing to vote against Hochul and for the Republican in the 2022 gubernatorial race. A recent Siena poll showed that Hochul’s standing in the suburbs and among white voters hasn’t improved since that election. If she is the Democratic nominee next year, Hochul’s fate could be in the hands of voters who deeply dislike Trump but are also troubled by New York’s direction and Hochul’s leadership. We obviously don’t know how these voters would react to her removing Adams. Polling outside New York City is scant. Perhaps they’d see it as overreach. But if a decision to remove Adams is going to resonate anywhere, the Trump-phobic suburbs would be an obvious place to look. That’s all From the Politics Desk for now.

Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, shortly after signing the order, that \"I think the women and families, husbands, are very appreciative of it.\"The president — whose billionaire top donor and ally Elon Musk has had several children by IVF — has long held conflicting stances on reproductive rights. He frequently boasts about appointing Supreme Court justices who ended federal protections for abortion access in 2022, a seismic move that made him a hero to the anti-abortion movement, which has driven conservative voters to the polls for decades.But he drew fury from that same movement when, during last year's presidential campaign, he announced that in a second term he would ensure free IVF, and claimed to be the \"father of IVF.\"At the time Trump voiced worries that Republicans were out of step with voters on the issue. Republicans are divided on fertility treatments such as IVF, with many hailing them as a boost to American families.Others, with strong beliefs that life begins at conception, oppose IVF because the procedure can produce multiple embryos, not all of which get used.Almost every Senate Republican voted against assuring IVF access in a vote in June last year — including then-Ohio senator JD Vance, now Trump's vice president.Reproductive rights activists had feared that the Supreme Court decision on abortion threatened IVF, especially after a court in Alabama last year ruled that frozen embryos could be considered people, leading to several clinics briefly pausing treatments.Trump's Democratic rival Kamala Harris had put reproductive rights at the heart of her election platform, warning that Trump's moves on abortion also jeopardized access to fertility treatments.","summary":"","url":"https://tribune.net.ph/2025/02/18/trump-moves-to-expand-access-to-ivf","image":"https://media.assettype.com/tribune/2025-02-18/3zc0nrbx/00036Y499A.jpg?w=1200&h=675&auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&enlarge=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18

the federal civilian workforce of more than 2 million employees favors their side, the likes of Bill Clinton, Barack Obama and Joe Biden were never going to fix it.\n\nAnd earlier, when the parties were less ideologically polarized and there were still quite a few conservative Democrats and liberal Republicans, it wasn’t as obvious as today that the bureaucracy’s partisan slant meant a workforce opposed to the duly elected president — when he’s not a Democrat.\n\nBut from Ronald Reagan onwards, it’s become clear that a Republican who tries to get the bureaucracy to carry out a conservative agenda will face a revolt from inside.\n\nThe Constitution’s separation of powers doesn’t provide for an executive branch divided against itself — it’s the one branch that’s meant to be united within and checked from the outside.\n\nOriginally, the partisan makeup of the federal workforce depended almost entirely on who won the White House: Once the modern parties had formed, Republicans would hire Republicans, Democrats hired Democrats, and every federal employee knew he stood to lose his job if the party in power changed.\n\nPoliticians on both sides saw government jobs as rewards to give their supporters, even if this meant hiring people who weren’t the best qualified.\n\nA nonpartisan, meritocratic civil service seemed like the solution to the inefficiency and you-scratch-my-back, I’ll-scratch-yours corruption of this system.\n\nYet like many well-intended reforms, this one backfired.\n\nInstead of a nonpartisan civil service, what we have now is a civil service whose partisanship no longer alternates based on elections — a perpetual liberal government, unanswerable to voters.\n\nGuo Xu, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley’s Haas School of Business, has studied the magnitude and effect of partisanship in the federal workforce.\n\nAnalyzing data from 1997 to 2019, he found roughly half of all federal employees were Democrats (compared to 41% of the public at large) — while the percentage of Republicans in federal jobs slid from 32% to 26%, with independents gaining the difference.\n\nThat’s an almost two-to-one ratio of Democrats to Republicans in the civil service.\n\nThe imbalance is even more pronounced in many departments and agencies, however, with Democrats making up some 70% of Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Education, and State Department employees, Xu found.\n\nThe bias is also stronger in the highest reaches of the civil service, with Democrats amounting to 63% of top-level federal career executives.\n\nXu and his research colleagues found cost overruns on government contracts increase by some 8% when there’s a partisan “misalignment” between the president and the bureaucrat overseeing the outlay.\n\n“When we looked at HR surveys covering federal government workers, we also found that politically misaligned respondents were less motivated and less likely to identify with the overall mission of the agency,” Xu said in an interview on the BerkeleyHaas website.\n\nXu is no conservative critic of the system — he takes the lack of turnover in the federal workforce when party control of the White House changes to mean “civil service protections work, shielding career civil servants from political interference.”\n\nIn truth, civil servants with partisan commitments of their own are being shielded from the consequences of elections — as if the American people have no right to “interfere” in their own government.\n\nA new report by the Foundation for Government Accountability confirms Guo’s findings and expands on them, noting, “In the 2024 presidential election, 84% of federal employees’ political donations went to Kamala Harris.”\n\nThe result: When voters elect a Democrat as president, they get a Democratic administration — but if they elect a Republican, they get a mixed administration weakened by partisan divisions between political appointees and the civil service.\n\nThis is one reason Republican efforts to scale back the federal government have failed for so long: In effect, there have only been semi-Republican administrations for decades, or one continuous Democratic administration with some temporary Republican heads.\n\nIt’s time to reform the civil-service reforms that created this mess.\n\nThere’s something to be said for returning to what older reformers got right, such as relying on standardized examinations for hiring and promotion in place of recent, highly politicized criteria such as “diversity, equity, and inclusion.”\n\nBeyond that, though, it’s necessary to admit that bureaucrats are partisans too.\n\nPresident Trump’s plan to reclassify many federal employees as Schedule F appointees, allowing him to remove them more easily, is a step toward making the bureaucracy more accountable to the democratic process.\n\nBy fighting the partisan bias of the permanent government, Trump isn’t endangering the Constitution, he’s restoring its balance.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review and editor-at-large of The American Conservative.","summary":"Donald Trump is the first

Ashley St. Clair, She Says, Which Makes Him the Father of At Least 13 Kids","text":"Ashley St. Clair claimed in a post to X (incidentally, the name of one of Musk's children with Grimes) that she had birthed Musk’s latest progeny, and that Musk was now ghosting her. In a statement captioned “Alea Iacta Est,” Latin for “the die is cast,” she wrote:\n“Five months ago, I welcomed a new baby into the world. Elon Musk is the father.\nI have not previously disclosed this to protect our child’s privacy and safety, but in recent days it has become clear that tabloid media intends to do so, regardless of the harm it will cause. I intend to allow our child to grow in a normal and safe environment. For that reason, I ask that the media honor our child’s privacy, and refrain from invasive reporting.”\nSt. Clair, whose bio on the social media platform reads in part, “Press inquiries: Don’t inquire,” included contact information for press inquiries at the foot of her statement.\nSpeaking to the New York Post, St. Clair said that she was mother to a son, whose name she wants to keep secret and whom she claimed to have never taken on a walk outdoors.\nAccording to St. Clair, she first met Musk on X, when “he slid into my DMs. I think it was a meme.” The two struck up a romance from there, she said. At the time, St. Clair was an operations employee for the Babylon Bee, a conservative satire website. She has also appeared as a talking head on Fox News, despairing over the falling birth rate in America, a favorite MAGA topic.\nShe claimed that she went public with news of her second child (she also has a toddler from a previous relationship) because she was being harassed by “a cohort of very violent stalkers” and also feared that a tabloid reporter who had pursued the story would reveal her.\n“Almost every relationship in my life would be bastardized and disingenuous because I couldn’t tell them what was going on,” she said of her pregnancy and baby. “My son has never taken a walk outside—in five months. I have never been able to take my baby for a walk. I was terrified that someone would see I had a baby and it would get out.”\nBut also: “My child is the most perfect thing that happened to me. I wouldn’t change anything.”\nSt. Clair wrote the 2021 children’s book, Elephants Are Not Birds, described as an “unapologetic rebuke of transgender acceptance,” which was part of conservative children’s book publisher Brave Books’ debut lineup.\nMusk, who did not respond to Vanity Fair’s request for comment, hasn’t directly issued any statements about St. Clair's claim. On Saturday, he responded on X to Milo Yiannopoulos’s screenshot of a 2020 post of St. Clair’s where she joked about marrying Musk. “Woah,” he wrote. Succinct.\nIn a since-deleted response to that post on X, according to screenshots, St. Clair had a few more choice words of her own.\n“Elon, we have been trying to communicate for the past several days and you have not responded,” she wrote. “When are you going to reply to us instead of publicly responding to smears from an individual who just posted photos of me in underwear at 15 years old?”\nBrian Glicklich, who is acting as a spokesperson for St. Clair, wrote in a statement on X Saturday that Musk and St. Clair “have been privately working towards the creation of an agreement about raising their child for some time.” Privacy is no longer an option due to what Glicklich characterized in the statement as an “ambush” from the tabloid reporter.\n“We are waiting for Elon to publicly acknowledge his parental role with Ashley,” he wrote.\nA source close to St. Clair confirmed to VF Monday that Musk has not been in touch with St. Clair since her announcement. If St. Clair’s allegations are true, her son is Musk’s 13th publicly known child, and she is the fourth woman known to have procreated with him. Musk is also known to have offered his sperm to multiple women, often unsolicited.\n“Fine Taylor … you win … I will give you a child and guard your cats with my life,” he tweeted after Swift publicly endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.","summary":"Ashley St. Clair claims she gave birth to the big DOGE’s baby five months ago, though he has yet to comment publicly.

And it’s working: Musk’s popularity has been sinking steadily since inauguration, accelerated by his weird press conference in the Oval Office last week (when Musk’s son demanded that Trump step aside for the real president — his father).\n\nTrump probably likes that Musk is taking the heat now, but Musk probably is dragging down Trump’s polling numbers. How long will Trump tolerate that — especially when he can eventually blame Musk, cut him loose and tell Americans: See, I got rid of the problem.\n\nIn an appearance on “Erin Burnett OutFront” recently, CNN polling chief Harry Enten said that Musk’s net favorability rating has dropped to -13 points — down an additional three points before the election. \n\nHow bad is it getting? Well, Musk’s popularity was plus-29 points before the 2016 election, when he almost single-handedly was funding Trump’s campaign with roughly $270 million, pleading for the bro vote to go MAGA, strong-arming Kamala Harris supporters on Twitter/X and hunting non-existent election fraud in Pennsylvania.\n\nNow, however, DOGE czar Musk is hiring wanna-be Nazi hackers to access the nation’s most sensitive secrets, lusting for Americans' personal data, demanding that media companies that doesn’t kiss Trump’s butt get handed long prison sentences — while insisting he’s a free-speech advocate. He’s accidentally firing U.S. nuclear arms stewards and lying about USAID.\n\nOh, and he’s also suggesting that Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid must be weeded of its leeches — Americans who rely on these safety nets for their retirements. He even lied that some of those collecting are 150 years old.\n\nSigns are obvious that Americans might have had enough of the world’s richest man, his ego, racism and conspiracy theories.\n\nWhen asked what Americans should do to fight Trump, Democratic strategist James Carville cleverly said on MSNBC, “Don’t just stand there, do nothing!” In other words, Carville said, “Get out of the way” of the organic protests that will sink Musk and Trump, he predicted.\n\nIn addition to the polling numbers — Trump’s are falling, too, amid the chaos and his lack of attention to inflation — Carville says a gubernatorial election in Virginia later this year likely will send a strong message when many federal workers cast their votes.\n\nIf the GOP gets beaten in early elections, Trump might feel the heat and file for a Musk divorce, if the relationship lasts that long.\n\nMeanwhile, even the betting markets are down on Musk, whom bettors predict won’t cut much from the deficit or, in the end, whack enough governmental jobs to make MAGA happy.","summary":"Americans are souring on president's billionaire sidekick","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/02/recent-signs-point-to-trump-elon-musk-breakup-coming-sooner-not-later.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/SNJ6XUB25VG75MPLNG7WWYE4JY.JPG?auth=964a87bb042b5dbb05c5276a5aa1ac4a3ca633373c6baf9f3cc68c56ba2b10b8&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 20:00:00","author":"Kevin Manahan","authors":["Kevin Manahan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.528},{"id":291887822,"title":"ESPN loudmouth mulls White House bid: This is ‘an utter embarrassment to the Democratic Party’","text":"Is ESPN host Stephen A. Smith actually considering making a run for the White House?\n\nSmith generated internet buzz earlier this month after he floated the idea of entering politics during a podcast episode. Smith, a sports analyst who frequently comments on politics, joined former President Barack Obama’s advisor to discuss the state of the Democratic Party on Tuesday’s episode of the “Pod Save America” podcast. \n\nTommy Vietor, a former spokesman for Obama, asked Smith about online chatter of him potentially throwing his hat in the ring for the White House. Smith reiterated that he has no interest in becoming a politician and said he would only consider running for office “if the country was in a bad place” and he was “favored to win an election.”\n\n“So again, for me, personally, with what I have going on in my life, with how happy I am, with the fact that I’m more interested in me remaining a pundit and a commentator rather than a politician, those things still stand. I’m very authentic in saying that I have no desire to be a politician whatsoever,” Smith said. \n\n“But my God, if you came to me and said, ‘Listen, there is nobody else, and America is clamoring for you,’ which I sincerely doubt would ever happen. But if that were to happen, would I give it strong consideration? I won’t lie, yes, I would. I would give it strong consideration,” he added.\n\nSmith and Vietor continued to discuss what they believe are the shortcomings of the Democratic Party. Smith argued that Democrats need to be their “real, true, authentic self, for better or worse” in order to get Americans to vote for them.\n\nSmith then criticized Democrats over their messaging, saying they need to find a candidate who can tell Republicans that they are “better than the candidate that you have, because I’m gonna look out for you better than the candidate that you have.”\n\n“This is what Trump did. He was fearless with it. Where are those Democrats? I don’t see them around. That’s why I’m a damn candidate. Because of that. It’s embarrassing,” Smith said. \n\nHe emphasized that it was “embarrassing” for some people to back Smith for the White House because the Democratic Party has no one else. \n\n“I believe it is an utter embarrassment to the Democratic Party that I am a candidate in people’s eyes for the presidency of the United States,” he said. “It is an indictment against them, and they need to get their act together before somebody like me or somebody else takes it real seriously and says, ‘the hell with y’all.’ Because the roster that I’m seeing right now: Y’all don’t have anything.”\n\nSmith’s comments come after a staff writer at The New Yorker also floated the ESPN host for president over the weekend. A recent poll by McLaughlin & Associates found Smith had 2% of support in a poll asking respondents about candidates for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. \n\nSmith makes frequent appearances on cable news shows, including with Fox News' Sean Hannity. He told Hannity earlier this month that he thinks \"somebody like me could actually win\" due to the “state” of the Democratic Party. \n\nIt’s not clear who will be the frontrunners for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary. Vice President Kamala Harris, who lost to President Donald Trump last fall, is reportedly keeping her options open for another run for office.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.”\n\nThe dissonance is strong in this one.\n\nI’ll give you the context for both quotes. The first was in response to a clip from CBS host Margaret Brennan who claimed, during an interview with US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, that “free speech was weaponised to conduct a genocide” by the Nazis.\n\nMr Musk was actually replying to Vice President J.D. Vance, who had wondered: “Does the media really think the Holocaust was caused by free speech?”\n\nI’ll admit to being an outlier here, judging by the sheer breadth of gobsmacked reaction to Ms Brennan’s remark, but I thought her point was fairly plain and defensible.\n\nAdolf Hitler and other top Nazis spent years saying the most horrendous things about Jewish people, thoroughly dehumanising them, and blaming them for all Germany’s ills. They did this so successfully that Germans were willing to look the other way, if not actively participate, as Jews were stripped of their rights and, eventually, systematically murdered.\n\nSo no, free speech didn’t “cause” the Holocaust, not directly. But Hitler exploited his freedom to say such monstrous things to sow the seeds. If Anthony Albanese started to round up say, Muslims, starting tomorrow, and sent them to death camps, Australians wouldn’t accept it, would they? But if Australia had been drowning in virulently anti-Muslim rhetoric for a decade? The tolerance level would be higher.\n\nThat’s not necessarily an argument against greater freedom of speech – each society has to figure out where to set the line of what’s legally acceptable and what isn’t – but I’d argue Ms Brennan’s critics have completely missed her point. Which is that entirely unfettered freedom of speech can be exploited by the cynical, or the downright evil, for ruinous ends.\n\nAnyway, the second Elon quote. In this case he was blasting America’s 60 Minutes, also on CBS, for having interviewed the former head of America’s international development agency USAID. Andrew Natsios is a lifelong Republican, who served in that position under George W. Bush. He has been fiercely critical of Mr Musk’s DOGE team for gutting the agency.\n\nMr Musk clearly isn’t happy about the interview; hence his reflexive attempt to discredit 60 Minutes, and rather shrill assertion that its staff deserve to be in jail.\n\nHe was alluding there to a lawsuit, brought against CBS by Donald Trump, which is worth running through in some detail. Because it’s illustrative of what the President has been doing, in the legal realm, since he won the election.\n\nIn brief, Mr Trump has accused CBS of damaging him, during last year’s campaign, by “deceptively” editing a prerecorded interview with his opponent, the then-vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nHere is how the controversy unfolded. 60 Minutes interviewed Ms Harris. And these big interviews are always promoted on the network’s breakfast show (the equivalent of Sunrise or Today here in Australia). So, the team at 60 Minutes sent Face the Nation a slice of the interview to use in a preview segment.\n\nFace the Nation’s crew edited it one way, airing the interviewer’s question and then part – not all – of Ms Harris’s answer. Here is the transcript of what viewers saw.\n\nInterviewer: “But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. The Wall Street Journal said that he – that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu. And in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration’s entreaties.”\n\nHarris: “Well Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region, by Israel, that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.”\n\nWhen 60 Minutes aired its edit of the interview, the same question was followed by a different answer. Here is that transcript.\n\nInterviewer: “But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. The Wall Street Journal said that he – that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu. And in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration’s entreaties.”\n\nHarris:“We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”\n\n“Aha!” said the MAGA sleuths. Stone cold evidence that CBS had manipulated the footage that aired on 60 Minutes to make Ms Harris seem ... more coherent? Better? I mean both of the quotes above were delivered in her characteristic meaningless word salad style. Neither was ever going to impress anyone.\n\nWe now have access to the full transcript of everything 60 Minutes recorded, before any edits – something CBS really should have released when the controversy first broke out. Here is the full answer.\n\nInterviewer: “But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. The Wall Street Journal said that he – that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided by Netanyahu. And in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administration’s entreaties.”\n\nHarris: “Well Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region, by Israel, that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we’re not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”\n\nSo Face the Nation picked one half of the answer and 60 Minutes picked the other. That was the catalyst for all the online furore, and for Mr Trump’s lawsuit, and for Elon’s argument that everyone involved deserves to rot in a cell.\n\nWe now have a great number of people pretending not to know how television works, including Mr Trump himself, who has no small amount of experience in the medium.\n\n60 Minutes spoke to Ms Harris for 40-odd minutes. It had 21 minutes of airtime for her interview. Square peg, round hole. Edits for brevity and clarity were necessary. This is how prerecorded broadcast interviews have worked for decades.\n\nSo a long, rambling and ultimately quite pointless answer on Israel, for example, had to be chopped down. There was no “deception”. No attempt to make Ms Harris look better. Go and read the full transcript for yourself, or look up the raw, unedited footage.\n\n(Frankly it wasn’t possible to make her look better, even if that had been one’s aim. Not a great performance.)\n\nThe same problem exists in print or on the internet, by the way. If I spend 20 minutes chatting to some academic for news.com.au, to get their analysis on tariff policy or whatever, guess what? I don’t publish every single quote. I’m not going to spam you with 5000 words and a bunch of irrelevant answers.\n\nHave you ever seen a newspaper? There are finite column inches. Strict word limits. Copy is cut down to fit the space available.\n\nAnd it’s even more frustratingly brutal in television. You have a limited amount of time. Significant edits cannot be avoided. Every time you watch the 6pm news, you are not seeing a heap of decent content that just couldn’t be squeezed in.\n\nSo, the lawsuit. Mr Trump alleges CBS edited the Harris interview for political reasons, because it wanted to make her seem more competent, or presidential, or something. Better. And he alleges this caused him immense financial damage.\n\nI fool you not, this is the argument: that if not for 60 Minutes’ “deceptive” edits, Mr Trump would have been able to raise more money for his presidential campaign. A lot more money. He was seeking damages of $US10 billion, before he upped that to $20 billion this month.\n\nDo take a moment to digest the ludicrous scale of that claim, please.\n\nThroughout the entirety of the presidential campaign, Mr Trump raised less than $400 million. His lawsuit rests on an assertion that, absent the 60 Minutes edits, he would have brought in a further $10 billion. In the single month that remained before election day.\n\nWe haven’t even discussed the laws he claims were violated, which very obviously do not apply to this case, but hey, that would require at least another 500 words.\n\nThe point is it’s an absurdly, laughably spurious lawsuit. But it’s going to pay off!\n\nWhy? Because Mr Trump is now President, and thus he gets to appoint the head of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – the agency that regulates broadcast media. The man he chose for this role is Brendan Carr.\n\nCoincidentally – oh, what timing! – there is a pending merger between CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, and the film production company Skydance Media, worth a cool $8 billion. The parties have agreed to it. They’re just awaiting approval from ... the FCC. From Mr Carr.\n\nHere is a recent, pertinent quote from him: “There’s a news distortion complaint at the FCC, still, having to do with CBS. CBS has a transaction before the FCC. I’m pretty confident that news distortion complaint over the CBS 60 Minutes transcript is something that’s likely to arise in the context of the FCC’s review of that transaction.”\n\nThe message there is unmistakeable. The proposed merger is inextricably linked to Mr Trump’s complaints about the 60 Minutes interview. So, hint hint CBS, if you want your lucrative merger to go through, you will bring the Trump case to an, ahem, satisfactory conclusion.\n\nLo and behold, we now hear reports that Paramount is negotiating a settlement, with Mr Trump, worth $100 million or so, having previously dismissed the lawsuit as nonsense.\n\nWhat do we call this other than naked corruption? Other than Mr Trump using the powers of the presidency to metaphorically dunk his enemies’ heads in a toilet and enrich himself in the process? A garbage lawsuit will earn him more money than most people will ever see in their lives, because his appointed yes man has the authority to block a merger on a whim.\n\nThis is not an isolated case. Mr Trump extracted $25 million from Facebook and $10 million from Twitter for suspending his accounts in the wake of the January 6, 2021 riot. Those cases were almost as baseless. But Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, one man already in his orbit and the other desperately seeking a place in it, decided to pay up.\n\nMr Trump also got an easy $15 million in a settlement from America’s ABC News, having sued it over comments by anchor George Stephanopoulos after he was found, in court, to have sexually assaulted the writer E. Jean Carroll.\n\nIn his coverage of the ruling, Mr Stephanopoulos said Mr Trump had been found “liable for rape”. He was echoing comments from the judge in the case, who’d said Mr Trump’s conduct fit “the common definition” of rape.\n\nAgain, it was a trash case, doomed to fail if it ever reached trial. But ABC News, seeking to make peace the new President I suppose, decided it was better to cave beforehand.\n\nWe have an American President firing out trash lawsuits like a sprinkler gone haywire, and cumulatively getting tens of millions of dollars for himself. We have him holding those cases over media organisations as leverage.\n\nThere is most certainly a critique to be made of the media companies here, for acquiescing instead of fighting Mr Trump in court. The owners of these businesses quite clearly care more about their profits than any principle at play.\n\nBut do keep this stuff in mind the next time Elon, or J.D., or Donald himself pretends to be a champion of free speech.\n\nThey love the concept when it lets them parrot whatever they read from Catturd on Twitter. When their political opponents exercise speech, though, in a way they don’t like? Then they launch lawsuits. Then they talk about prison. Utter, flaming hypocrites.\n\nX: @SamClench","summary":"Two tweets from Elon Musk, sent a mere 20 minutes apart, lay bare the hypocrisy at the heart of his worldview.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/they-deserve-prison-elon-musks-dissonance-and-donald-trumps-free-speech-hypocrisy/news-story/096b5771aee826a25461ff8a3ff6af34?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/e76f71806f0cf81d582ad7eb03e1ab10","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 19:52:57","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.16},{"id":291889238,"title":"Barred from joining the Democrat-led Latino Caucus, California Republican lawmakers create their own","text":"Republican lawmakers, excluded from the Democrat-led California Latino Legislative Caucus, have taken matters into their own hands. Nine Latino GOP legislators have created the California Hispanic Legislative Caucus to champion priorities that, they say, diverge from those prioritized by their liberal colleagues. “My experience as a Latino is different than that of my immigrant grandmother,” said Sen. Suzette Martinez Valladares (R-Acton), a former Assemblymember recently elected to the state Senate who helped create the GOP caucus. “The issues the Latino community want to focus on have been ignored by Sacramento.” Those changes, she said, have been coming for a long time. The California Legislature has undergone a historic shift and now includes 44 Latino lawmakers, more than a third of all state lawmakers and the most ever, a group that includes a growing number of Republicans. This comes at a time of evolving voter interests and demographic changes, with Republicans emphasizing that their new caucus will focus on Latino priorities around education, public safety and affordability and less on the \"monolithic\" issues that Democrats focus on, such as immigration and healthcare. California's changing political landscape became evident during the November election. Overall, 51% of Latino voters voted for the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris, but an estimated 54% of Latino men voted for the Republican nominee, Donald Trump. Voters in California also helped flip two Democratic districts by electing Republican Assemblymembers Jeff Gonzalez of Indio and Leticia Castillo of Home Gardens, both Latinos. “I view this as a very healthy development for the Latino community,” said Mike Madrid, a Republican political consultant and Latino demographics expert, who said Latino voters “are different” now than they were generations before. “I don’t think either party has ever had a monopoly on the hearts and minds of the Latino community.” Both parties tend to align on the cost of living and the economy, especially among blue-collar, working-class Latinos. But, Madrid points out, Latino Republicans and Democrats won't agree on policy issues that relate to abortion rights and immigration or anything \"beyond the economy.\" Among the top issues Latino voters care about are the cost of living, housing costs, jobs and the economy, according to a poll of 1,000 voters from the nonprofit Latino Community Foundation. Valladares, who formed the Republican caucus alongside Assemblymember Kate Sanchez (R-Trabuco Canyon) told The Times that “we are not monolithic.” Sen. Marie Alvarado-Gil of Jackson, a Democrat turned Republican, said she felt \"shut down\" by her Democrat counterparts. She also said the Democratic-led Latino Caucus would support \"antiquated solutions\" to issues such as farmworker rights that “keep Latinos under the monolithic umbrella of being poor, agricultural workers.” “That’s not the modern-day Latino,” she said. California's Latino population accounts for more than a third of the state's eligible voters, according to a 2024 study from UCLA's Latino Policy and Politics Institute. Latino Californians remain the most underpaid for hourly work and more lack a high school diploma compared with any other major racial or ethnic group, the study found. The Public Policy Institute of California found that Latinos are also the fastest-growing segment of the working class and shifted further right last year than in any election since 1994. The 35-member Latino Caucus, historically led by Democrats after the first Latino lawmakers were elected in 1962, has focused on a wide range of policy priorities, including giving protections and equal access to immigrants regardless of legal status, promoting STEM programs in schools and expanding paid sick leave and housing to farmworkers. “Even in the Latino Caucus, you have moderates, progressives and everything in between,” Miguel Santiago, a former Democratic assemblymember and Latino Caucus member. “But one thing that has always united us through every argument is our unwavering support for Latino communities, particularly those who are undocumented.” Santiago said he is “skeptical about the sincerity” of the Hispanic Legislative Caucus representing Latino interests, particularly when it comes to protecting the undocumented and that those differences “are irreconcilable.” Anthony Rendon (D-Lakewood), former Assembly speaker who left behind a legacy of progressive reforms, including giving farmworkers overtime pay and expanding childhood education, agrees that there should be a Latino caucus for each party. \"I never understood why they wanted to be part of our caucus other than obstructing us,\" he said. \"They would just yell, we'd take a vote, and they'd lose.\" This isn’t the first time Republicans have been excluded from joining the Latino Caucus. In 2014, Assemblymember Rocky Chavez was barred from joining, sparking a discussion over the diversity of opinion and policy goals among Latino policymakers. Madrid said the increasing number of Latino Republicans is “a healthy sign” of diversity within the community and believes that the political system should allow for these differences, without forcing consensus on racial or cultural issues. Latinos are viewing the world less through the lens of their ethnicity and, he said, \"that is progress.\" The Republican-led Hispanic Legislative Caucus will have nine members. It is currently registered as a nonprofit and a political action committee said Valladares, and they will begin supporting the reelection of incumbents and targeting other seats. They await official recognition from legislative leadership and approval for \"equal\" funding as the Latino Caucus for staffing, an amount Valladares said is around $500,000. Legislative leaders as of Friday afternoon were not available to answer whether they would approve that funding.","summary":"Latino Republicans said they were barred from joining the Democrat-led California Latino Legislative Caucus and have formed their own.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-02-18/republicans-barred-from-joining-the-democrat-led-latino-caucus-form-their-own","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/87f6b76/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2742x1440+0+194/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F70%2F20%2F4cf7bcca4587863f3d928f1f090c%2Fcalifornia-gun-contr","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 19:12:43","author":"Anabel Sosa","authors":["Anabel Sosa"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.054},{"id":291879556,"title":"Democratic operatives freaked out that party won't have 'come-to-Jesus' moment after Trump win: NYT","text":"Some Democratic Party operatives fear that their party is not going to learn anything from their historic 2024 defeat at the hands of President Trump. The New York Times published a report this week detailing the \"deepening distress\" some have that their party will not internalize what went wrong and what they need to fix following the 2024 election. \"The fear is that Democrats are squandering one of the few silver linings of losing: the chance to learn lessons from defeat,\" Times political reporter Shane Goldmacher wrote on Monday. 'IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY': DNC CHAIR CANDIDATES REVEAL HOW THEY WILL REBOUND AFTER DISASTROUS 2024 RESULTS In the piece, Goldmacher focused on a recent meeting of \"several dozen Democratic political operatives\" where they discussed \"hard truths\" that the party needs to confront. Jonathan Cowan, the president of the more centrist Democratic Party group, \"Third Way,\" which led the meeting, addressed attendees, saying, \"Now is not the time for taking refuge in comforting platitudes.\" According to the report, he added, \"Now is not the time to bet on the other guys\" messing up \"so badly that we win simply by not being them\" – with Goldmacher noting he used a \"much coarser\" phrase than \"messing up.\" Goldmacher quoted another leader at the meeting, Working Families Party National Director Maurice Mitchell, who said the party has to \"have a come-to-Jesus moment as a team.\" Much hay has been made by prominent Democratic strategists in the media out of the point that the party has doubled down on the woke ideas that cost it in 2024.

Longtime liberal media pundit Joe Klein savaged the continued insistence on prioritizing woke thinking present at the meeting, writing in his Substack column that it could be proof that the party is broken beyond repair. \"Yes, friends, still crazy after all these years… and the encroaching dementia is not benign. Can this party be saved? I have my doubts,\" he wrote. Goldmacher wrote that multiple Democratic groups across the \"party’s ideological spectrum\" are looking to reform the party but their \"views of how to fix what went wrong are often diametrically opposed.\" He noted that most concerned liberals understand that they have a \"problem with the working class,\" but there isn’t a consensus on how to address it. \"Some favor shedding unpopular policies or reprioritizing new ones. Others focus on improving the messages deployed to sell those policies to voters — or on how to deliver the party’s message, whatever it turns out to be, in a fractured media environment,\" he wrote, adding that trying to fight back against the current Trump agenda threatens to stymie any unified approach to fixing the party. HOMAN TAKES VICTORY LAP AFTER ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT CROSSINGS PLUMMET DURING TRUMP ADMIN: ‘HE IS DELIVERING' \"The pressure for Democrats to push back on President Trump’s expansive agenda further complicates any prospect of a unified, rigorous ‘autopsy’ like the one Republicans conducted in 2012. Opposing Mr. Trump has been the Democratic Party’s greatest unifying force for nearly a decade. But the 2024 election showed that its coalition of resistance is no longer a majority.\" Goldmacher continued, noting that Democratic figures do not agree with new DNC chair Ken Martin’s assessment that it’s \"wrong\" for the party to come up with a \"new message.\" \"The line has ricocheted through the party, leaving many Democrats shaking their heads in dismay and concluding that Mr. Martin will defend the status quo,\" he wrote.

Chuck Schumer (D-NY) suggested that some of Trump’s nominations would fail if the Senate voted by secret ballot.\n\n“Republicans are being strongarmed by Donald Trump,” Schumer said before Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s confirmation vote.\n\nWhen former President Joe Biden took office, he faced a 50-50 Senate. All of his Cabinet nominees were confirmed without the help of former Vice President Kamala Harris. In almost all cases, Democrats united to vote for Biden’s picks. Some of Biden’s nominees faced close votes, but it was not surprising when they were ultimately confirmed.\n\nFormer President George W. Bush also faced a 50-50 Senate upon taking office. Bush, however, got all of his main Cabinet nominees confirmed by Feb. 1, 2001, which is a record pace for 21st-century presidents.\n\nTrump’s nominees have faced more criticism from his party’s senators than in previous administrations. Sens. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Todd Young (R-IN) expressed concern over the nominations of Kennedy and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, respectively, but both voted to confirm them in the floor votes. In addition, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has voted to reject three Trump nominations, and Sens. Susan Collins (R-ME) and Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) have each voted “no” once.\n\nUnless a candidate is vastly unqualified for the role, the president should be able to select the Cabinet members he wants.

He promised us an end to the war, and he was able to get a ceasefire for us in Gaza, and for that we are grateful. Imagine how many hundreds of Palestinians we've been able to save because of the ceasefire,\" Bishara Bahbah, the chairman for Arab Americans for Peace told ABC News.\n\nIsrael and Hamas reached a ceasefire-hostage exchange deal five days before Trump was sworn into office. Both President Joe Biden and Trump have taken credit for the ceasefire deal.\n\nThe Biden-Harris administration faced criticism from the Arab American community due to its perceived unconditional support for Israel in its war on Gaza. More than 48,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 people and hundreds more were taken captive.\n\n\"President Biden was asleep at the wheel, ignoring our our pleas with him. So we decided to tell President Biden that because you have ignored us, we are going to punish you at the polls, and that's one of the major reasons why we decided to establish Arab Americans for Trump,\" Bahbah said.\n\nMany prominent Arab-American advocacy groups and community leaders threw their support behind Trump or Green Party candidate Jill Stein due to the Biden administration's stance on Gaza.\n\n\"For many people, this was very painful. This was not an easy choice, because they were looking at what was going on in Gaza, it was very hard for them to support President Biden,\" and later Vice President Harris, James Zoghby, the cofounder of the Arab American Institute, a political and policy organization that did not support Trump, told ABC News.\n\nNow, with Trump proposing the forcible displacement of Palestinians, and attempting to pressure Egypt and Jordan to take in Palestinians from Gaza -- by threatening to cut billions in aid -- some groups have maintained their support of Trump and are waiting to see what actions he takes and are maintaining their opposition to Harris and Biden.\n\n\"These were grotesque comments. They're unacceptable comments, they're absolutely horrific comments. But you know, at the end of the day, when you put them on a scale, they're comments. It's rhetoric, and I don't feel it is appropriate, nor is it honest to sit here and conflate it with the actions of the Biden-Harris administration, or to try and use that rhetoric to use it as a 'gotcha' moment to people who voted against the Biden-Harris administration,\" Hudhayfah Ahmad, the head of media for the Abandon Harris campaign, told ABC News.\n\nThe Abandon Harris campaign, which started as the Abandon Biden campaign, gave both Democratic Party candidates an ultimatum, asking for them to call for an unconditional ceasefire or lose the group's support. Biden and Harris did not meet the deadline set by the group to call for a ceasefire, according to Ahmad.\n\nThe Trump campaign was able to garner support from the Muslim American community largely in the last four weeks before the election by making public calls for a ceasefire and vowing to make it happen, Ahmad said.\n\n\"There was never really any support before that,\" Ahmad said.\n\n\"A considerable chunk of people who had previously committed to voting third party, said that I'm going to vote the Trump-Vance ticket at the top of the ticket, and I'll vote Green Party down ballot. I heard this from multiple people in multiple swing states,\" Ahmad said.\n\nBut some community leaders felt that despite the actions of the Biden Administration in Gaza, Trump would be worse.\n\n\"I was very much opposed to the hucksters who were trying to sell Jill Stein and to the folks who supported Donald Trump. It was a really not just a bad call, it was a dangerous call. And I felt that despite the insult, despite the hurt, we had a responsibility to think big. [Biden and Harris] were at fault for making our job more difficult,\" Zoghby said.\n\n\"The pain that we knew would occur if Donald Trump got back into the White House was too great to too many people,\" Zoghby said. \"Even though [Biden and Harris] didn't give us what we needed, we still had to recognize that letting Donald Trump back into the White House was was going to be a disaster.\"\n\nArab Americans for Peace -- an advocacy group formerly called Arab Americans for Trump -- changed its name this month after hearing some of Trump's rhetoric surrounding the displacement of Palestinians, but a leader told ABC News they have not yet withdrawn their support for Trump.\n\n\"Our objective from the very beginning for supporting Trump was peace. We were telling the Biden administration continuously to stop its aid to the Israelis because the Israelis are committing genocide with the arms that are provided by the United States and Western Europe,\" Bahbah said.\n\n\"The change of the name does not mean that we are withdrawing our support for President Trump. It just means that we are going back to the root cause of our very existence, which is the promotion of peace in the Middle East,\" Bahbah said.\n\nEven community leaders who did not support Trump as a candidate argued that he secured a ceasefire.\n\n\"Trump did this ceasefire solely for his own self interest and self image and self benefit. Nothing humanitarian about it at all,\" Ahmad said.\n\n\"It's hard to say that anyone feels regret [for supporting Trump] when you take into consideration that we are no longer seeing a daily influx of videos and pictures of children, men, women, elderly, being butchered with U.S. weaponry. That has stopped completely,\" Ahmad said.\n\nDespite some holding onto support for Trump, his comments on forcibly displacing Palestinians drew sharp criticism from Arab Americans.\n\n\"We are totally opposed to the idea of displacing Palestinians out of Gaza. Gaza belongs to the Palestinians, and it is not for anyone in the world to tell the Palestinians to leave that territory,\" Bahbah said.\n\n\"Like my father, Palestinians are prepared to die on their homeland. And will not immigrate or be forced out of their homeland,\" Bahbah said.\n\nBahbah said there is still time to see how Trump's rhetoric will play out in the Middle East, but said the next four years will be critical for the Israel-Arab conflict.\n\nHe said Arab Americans for Peace decided to support Trump because he promised to end the war in Gaza and ensure lasting peace in the Middle East.\n\nHe believes Trump's pressure on Netanyahu stopped the war in Gaza.\n\nBut Bahbah said he believes Trump's recent comments on Gaza are providing Israel cover to \"destroy\" the West Bank, drawing attention away from what is happening there.\n\nOther leaders in the Arab community strongly disagreed with Trump's comments on Gaza, and are skeptical of the motivations behind Trump's comments on wanting to forcibly displace Palestinians.\n\n\"I think the purpose is to provide Netanyahu the cover to end this ceasefire after phase one and secure the hostages and go no further.

Call your senators and tell them it’s time Donald Trump fire Elon Musk,” the ad continued, according to the Hill.\n\nThe Beltway broadsheet has been staggered by internal dissent since Bezos scrapped a presidential endorsement for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in October. \n\nLast month, workers demanded a meeting with Bezos to discuss issues causing “readers to question the integrity of this institution.”\n\nThe DC-based nonprofit had sent a copy of the planned ad to the Washington Post’s advertising department ahead of time, and an advertising sales representative had seemed confident about the ad running — raising no red flags, Solomón told the Hill.\n\nPapers with the wraparound ad would have been delivered to subscribers at Congress, the Pentagon and the White House.\n\nBut the publication — which was bought by Amazon founder Bezos in 2013 — told Common Cause that it had to drop the wrap, but could keep the one running inside.\n\n“We said, ‘Thanks, no thanks,’ because we had a lot of questions,” Solomón told the Hill.\n\nShe said the paper had provided sample art to Common Cause as a guideline for what its own ad would look like.\n\nThe sample was a wrap ad featuring a large photo of Trump giving a thumbs-up to highlight his promise to “end the electric vehicle mandate on Day 1,” funded by the American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers, according to the Hill.\n\n“It was a thank-you Donald Trump piece of art,” Solomón said.\n\nSome social media users started circulating the canceled ad on X, citing it as the paper’s latest capitulation to Trump.\n\n“Democracy dies on the cutting room floor,” Pulitzer-winning journalist Mike Stanton wrote in a post on X, twisting the WaPo’s “Democracy Dies in Darkness” tagline.\n\nCommon Cause launched its “Fire Elon Musk” campaign earlier this month to protest the billionaire’s growing power as Trump’s right-hand man.\n\nMusk runs the Department of Government Efficiency, a task force aimed at slashing federal spending. \n\nDOGE has put a freeze on federal funding and called for the government to “delete entire agencies.” \n\nMeanwhile, the left-leaning newspaper has suffered backlash

election in her favor, according to the Los Angeles Times and The Associated Press.\n\n In February, as a result of the lawsuit, CBS released the videos and full transcript of its interview segments

The controversy erupted after Musk accused the long-running news program of deliberate election interference and took the reference from an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired before the last election. Musk claims CBS edited Harris’s responses about the Middle East with the aim of misleading voters, echoing a $10 billion lawsuit filed by former President Donald Trump against the network.\n\nTaking to X (formerly Twitter), Musk posted a clip from the interview and wrote, “60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world! They engaged in deliberate deception to interfere with the last election. They deserve a long prison sentence.” Despite Musk’s accusations, CBS released the full transcript and footage of the Harris interview. That proves that both answers were aired in different contexts but not manipulated. The network stood by their point that they have been ethical. \n\n60 Minutes are the biggest liars in the world!

[+] (Photo by DANIEL MIHAILESCU/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nTate, who has more than 10 million followers on X, has repeatedly praised Trump and urged his American followers to vote for him ahead of the 2024 election, posting such praises as “All Trump does is win” and stating those who oppose him should be “expelled from the country.”\n\nTate has compared himself to Trump, in one post noting both he and Trump have been accused of sex crimes and were “vilified by old recordings making jokes,” likely referring to various sexual misconduct allegations made against Trump and his controversial leaked Access Hollywood tape.\n\nTate, a self-avowed misogynist, has used sexist language to prop up Trump, in one post stating his election victory kept “evil war mongering she witches out of office” and in other posts used homophobic slurs and offensive language to refer to supporters of former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMembers of Trump’s inner circle have also voiced support for Tate, including Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr., who called Tate’s detention in Romania “absolute insanity,” and billionaire Elon Musk, who last month replied to a post on X about Tate voicing his intent to run for United Kingdom prime minister, praising Tate’s assessment of U.K. politics as “not wrong.”\n\nVice President JD Vance slammed the Romanian government last week, though not about Tate’s detention, accusing the government of suppressing free speech by annulling an election result that was thought to be influenced by Russian meddling.\n\nOne of the young staffers behind Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, Gavin Kliger, has also boosted Tate’s content on social media, Reuters reported.\n\nU.S. officials have reportedly urged Romania to lift travel restrictions on Tate, the Financial Times reported, citing three unnamed sources. The matter was first raised by U.S. officials on a call with the Romanian government, and again raised by Trump administration diplomat Richard Grenell at the Munich Security Conference last week. A spokesperson for the Romanian foreign minister, Emil Hurezeanu, told the Financial Times that “Romanian courts are independent and operate based on the law, there is due process,” and declined to comment on specific discussions about Tate. Grenell told the Financial Times he had “no substantive conversation” with Hurezenau, but clarified he supports Tate.\n\nWho Is Andrew Tate?\n\nThe American-born, British-raised Tate, formerly a world champion kickboxer and reality television personality known for his appearance on the United Kingdom edition of “Big Brother,” has since developed a significant online following across platforms including X, Instagram and YouTube, though he has faced multiple suspensions, with YouTube stating in 2022 that Tate had violated the platform’s “hate speech” policy. Tate’s X account has more than 10 million followers. He has built an online personality promoting masculinity, but his views frequently veer into sexist territory, and he has described himself as a “misogynist.” Tate has said female rape victims must “bear responsibility” for their attacks and that women belong in the household. Tate has also voiced support for the patriarchy and frequently uses racial, homophobic and sexist slurs in his social media posts. Tate has also launched various online programs billed as educational, primarily targeted at young men, which have drawn significant controversy over accusations they teach men to exploit women. Among these is “War Room,” which charges participants thousands and promises to “free the modern man from socially induced incarceration.” A BBC investigation of chat logs from the “War Room” alleged the program’s courses taught men how to groom women into sex work, and found dozens of alleged victims.\n\nWhat Crimes Is Andrew Tate Accused Of?\n\nTate was detained in Romania in December 2022 and indicted six months later on charges of rape, human trafficking and engaging in organized criminal activity, all of which Tate has denied. Prosecutors accused Tate and his brother, Tristan Tate, as well as two Romanian women, of recruiting women and forcing them to make pornographic content. Romanian officials said in August they were investigating the Tate brothers for trafficking of minors and alleged sexual intercourse with a minor. Tate has also been accused of sexual violence in the United Kingdom, where a Romanian court ruled he may be extradited after his trial in Romania. Tate’s pending Romanian trial, however, was blocked by an appeals court in December, which ruled his indictment did not meet the requirements to proceed to trial.\n\nTate is considered to be a prominent figure in the “manosphere”—a loosely defined movement of influencers who promote pro-male, frequently misogynistic views to their social media followings. The manosphere received heightened attention during the 2024 presidential election as several podcasters and social media celebrities thought to be part of the movement endorsed and, in some cases, met with Trump, which the Washington Post reported was at the behest of Trump’s youngest son, Barron. Trump appeared on a livestream with Adin Ross, a 24-year-old streamer who has 7 million Instagram followers and 4.5 million YouTube subscribers. Trump also spoke with Joe Rogan, the world’s most popular podcaster, and met with other influencers with millions of followers each, including Bryce Hall, Theo Von and Logan Paul. The “manosphere” was considered important for Trump’s 2024 election victory, as he improved his share of the vote with young men.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nTrump administration pressures Romania to lift restrictions on Andrew Tate (Financial Times)\n\nWhat We Know About Andrew Tate’s ‘War Room’—As Report Alleges Global Network To Exploit Women (Forbes)\n\nWhat to Know About the Accusations Against Andrew Tate (New York Times)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

Jean Carroll; in reality, the jury found him liable for sexual abuse, not rape, under New York law.\n\nAs part of the settlement, Disney paid $15 million to Trump’s presidential library and an additional $1 million to cover his legal fees. Stephanopoulos also issued a public apology expressing regret for the erroneous remarks.","summary":"Whoopi Goldberg slammed the notion that she has to learn to talk to President Donald Trump's voters.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/02/18/media/whoopi-goldberg-clashes-with-the-view-co-host-on-talking-totrump-voters/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/02/the-views-whoopi-goldberg-talking-98764867.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 17:00:35","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.326},{"id":291838942,"title":"MAGA actor runs to Fox to beg Elon Musk to save ‘good’ pro-Trump federal workers from DOGE cuts","text":"Appealing to “first buddy” Elon Musk during a Fox News appearance, Shazam! star Zachary Levi urged the world’s richest man to save the “good people” who are working for the federal government – specifically, the “people that voted for Donald Trump who are losing their job.”\n\nLevi, who supported Donald Trump during this past election, also told Fox News host Jesse Watters on Tuesday night that he was “so grateful” that Trump defeated Kamala Harris, especially since it meant that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard were now in the Trump administration.\n\nPromoting his upcoming faith-based film The Unbreakable Boy on Jesse Watters Primetime, Levi was first asked a sarcastic question about Harris and her recent visit to Broadway, prompting the actor to gush over Trump and his Cabinet picks.\n\n“I was very supportive of Bobby Kennedy,” Levi declared. “That led me to Donald Trump. And I am so grateful. I am so grateful that the election went the way that it did, and specifically because people like Bobby and Tulsi Gabbard are now in there and confirmed and can do the work and listen.”\n\nEventually, Levi turned his attention to Musk and his “government efficiency” department, which Trump has tasked with slashing thousands of federal jobs, cutting spending, and dismantling government agencies. At the same time, amid a flurry of lawsuits and court orders over the Department of Government Efficiency’s unprecedented actions and potentially unlawful access to sensitive information, the White House is now claiming Musk isn’t in charge of DOGE and has “no actual or formal authority to make government decisions.”\n\nAccording to the 44-year-old thespian, “DOGE is complicated,” but there are some federal employees who will be impacted by the cuts that don’t deserve to be terminated. And he would like Musk to make sure they keep their jobs.\n\n“Like there are a lot of people that are very afraid right now because there are truly good working people that work for the government, that are getting lost in the cracks,” Levi said. “And we have got to do something about that.”\n\nTurning to the camera, the actor appeared to plead directly to the Tesla CEO to find a way to retain some of these workers, especially the ones who currently support the president.\n\n“Please — Elon and all of your team and whatever needs to happen — please don’t let everybody fall through the cracks as we are doing what is necessary, which is to get in there and to like cut a cancer out, man,” Levi said. “You know, sometimes they go in for cancer surgeries, doctors, and you lose some good healthy tissue along in that. They don’t want to do that, but it’s a part of like extracting that darkness out of there. And right now that’s what’s happening.”\n\nHe concluded: “But there are good people, people that voted for Donald Trump who are losing their job.

The filing comes after D.C. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan heard remarks in the case filed by 14 state attorneys general against Musk and the Trump administration. The states argue that Musk and the administration have engaged in illegal executive overreach. Chutkan expressed that she wasn't convinced by the arguments on Monday after asking what harm the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) imposed, as well as whether any federal employee terminations took place at the end of last week. DOGE SAYS IT FOUND NEARLY UNTRACEABLE BUDGET LINE ITEM RESPONSIBLE FOR $4.7T IN PAYMENTS Following the remarks, Joshua Fisher, director of the Office of Administration, submitted a signed declaration clarifying that Musk \"is an employee of the White House Office,\" where he holds the position of \"a non-career Special Government Employee.\" \"In that job, Mr. Musk is a Senior Adviser to the President,\" Fisher wrote. \"It is not uncommon for the President to have Senior Advisors who are SGEs.\" Fisher compared Musk's White House role to that of former top Biden advisor Anita Dunn.

DOGE'S ACCESS TO CRITICAL IRS SYSTEM CONTAINING TAXPAYER INFORMATION IS IMMINENT Dunn served as a political strategist and advisor to Biden on his 2020 campaign and in the White House. Fisher continued on to say that Musk \"has no greater authority than other senior White House advisors\" and, as such, has no \"actual or formal authority\" to make government decisions. \"Mr. Musk can only advise the President and communicate the President's directives,\" Fisher wrote.

(sic)\n\nAnd he later added in all capitals: 'I remember going to Japan and gasping when I saw what is known as the swastika on clothing. It felt illegal to even look at it. That's how I had been programmed.\n\n'I then found out that swastika had many different meanings and many different names,' he added. \n\nThis comes after his ex-wife Kim Kardashian continues to stay mum on Kanye's rants. Over the weekend, the 44-year-old looked sensational as she hit the red carpet at the SNL 50 event in NYC.\n\nThe singer added: 'I've had my swastika t shirt idea for over 8 years. It was so intruging to me that a symbol had so much programing in it.'

His website went down amid fierce backlash to the rapper using the Super Bowl to sell swastika T-Shirts which has seen him be slammed by The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for 'vile antisemitism'.\n\nLast week David Schwimmer, 58 - who notably portrayed Ross Geller on the beloved sitcom Friends - took to his Instagram page to urge Tesla CEO Elon Musk to 'stop giving him a megaphone' on the platform. \n\nThe actor uploaded screenshots of the rapper's recent unhinged rants on what is formerly known as Twitter. \n\n'This is so 2022,' he began in the caption. 'We can't stop a deranged bigot from spewing hate filled, ignorant bile… but we CAN stop giving him a megaphone, Mr. Musk.'\n\n'Kanye West has 32.7 million followers on your platform, X. That's twice as many people than the number of Jews in existence.'\n\nSchwimmer continued, 'His sick hate speech results in REAL LIFE violence against Jews.' \n\n'I don't know what's worse, the fact that he identifies as a Nazi (which implies he wants to exterminate ALL marginalized communities including his own).' \n\n'Or the fact that there is not sufficient OUTRAGE to remove and ban him from all social media at this point. Silence is complicity,' David concluded in his message to Elon. \n\nMusk began his acquisition of Twitter back in April 2022, which was then concluded that same year in October. \n\nThe SpaceX founder has been vocal about censorship and an advocate for free speech. \n\nBack in February of last year, Elon penned on X: 'Free speech is the bedrock of democracy. That's why it's the FIRST Amendment. Without free speech, all is lost.' \n\nSchwimmer's account on X is currently 'suspended' as of Sunday, February 9 - although it is not exactly known when that took place. \n\nEarlier this week on Thursday, West - also known as Ye - took to X where he labeled himself as a Nazi and also asked President Donald Trump to free Sean 'Diddy' Combs. \n\nThe music artist further sparked outrage when he mocked Cassie's assault by Diddy - who is currently in prison while awaiting trial for sex trafficking charges. \n\nKanye has also since taken to the social media platform to say he has 'dominion' over his wife Bianca Censori and branded her controversial naked Grammys dress the 'best look of all time.' \n\nWest was first accused of anti-Semitism in 2022 after making a series of racist remarks. However, he later apologized, insisting it was not his 'intention to hurt or demean' the Jewish community.\n\nYet in a rambling U-turn, Kanye penned a series of tweets on X on Thursday, claiming that he will never 'trust or work with Jewish people' again and insisting he 'will not apologize' for his views. \n\nAmong his most shocking tweets in the hours-long tirade, Kanye proudly declared: 'I AM A NAZI', later adding: 'I LOVE HITLER NOW WHAT B*****S.' \n\nThe troubled rapper also addressed concerns that his wife Bianca Censori is a victim of coercive control after her naked outing at the Grammys, claiming he has 'dominion' over her.\n\nKanye, who took aim at several minority groups in his foul-mouthed tirade, went on to state that 'IF I LOST EVERYTHING ‘AGAIN TONIGHT WAS WORTH IT I CAN DIE AFTER THIS', while also insisting he was 'sober' while tweeting.\n\nHaving voiced his support for incarcerated rapper Diddy, Kanye doubled down by saying he would 'never speak again' to anyone who disagreed with him, while also using homophobic slurs to lash out at those who supported Kamala Harris.\n\nKanye also went on to lash out at the 'woke' decision to use female plus-size models in fashion shows.","summary":"In response to his Yeezy store being pulled due to it having just one garment for sale, a T-shirt emblazoned with a swastika he wrote: 'No one seems to wanna produce me wittle t shirt.'

Over the past few weeks, a growing chorus of congressional Democrats have started to signal that they’re willing to weaponize a government shutdown as a bargaining tool in their broader efforts to scale back the Trump administration’s cost-cutting efforts.\n\nIn Representative Eric Swalwell’s (D., Calif.) view, voting in favor of a Republican-authored stopgap funding bill — called a continuing resolution, or C.R. for short — to keep the federal government open will only enable Trump’s efforts to dismantle it. Trump is “firing government workers, freezing federal aid, forcing resignations, making us less safe, and we’re paying more,” the California Democrat told National Review in an interview last week. “He’s shutting down the government already. And so, we shouldn’t enable a further shutdown of services.”\n\nIf Speaker Mike Johnson’s stopgap funding bill is “just a continuation of further shutting down the government,” Swalwell warned, “you’re not going to see me, at least, participate.”\n\nOut of power and divided in strategy, a significant number of congressional Democrats eager to appease their base say they are prepared to go big to push back against Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). They say this year’s GOP trifecta in Washington means it’s Republicans’ responsibility to avert a shutdown, and the in-power party’s leaders shouldn’t rely on their votes to keep the government humming this time around.\n\nSlim House GOP majorities in recent years have required House Republicans to rely on Democratic votes to pass government-funding bills, enraging the rightmost flank of the GOP which has long preferred single-subject spending bills to mammoth continuing resolutions. Those tensions came to a head in late December, when House Republican fiscal hawks, Trump, and Elon Musk pressured Johnson to abandon his first legislative attempt: a pricey, 1,547-page, bipartisan continuing resolution chock-full of Democratic sweeteners.\n\nA second, 118-page, Trump-endorsed resolution also failed when 38 House Republicans voted no on the House floor in opposition to a provision that would have increased the country’s borrowing limit. (An almost entirely united Democratic caucus also voted against that second attempt, largely over frustrations that Johnson abandoned his bipartisan bill, icing their party out of negotiations in the process.) Johnson lucked out on his third try, but only after nixing a Trump-preferred debt ceiling increase.\n\nMindful of these intra-GOP tensions, some Democrats are trying to get creative by using fiscal hawks’ talking points against their Republican colleagues.\n\n“If Elon Musk and DOGE has found all of this fraud, and waste, and abuse — hundreds of billions of dollars, as they claim — well, then, we can’t fund the government by C.R. anymore,” Jared Moskowitz (D., Fla.) mused on the House floor last week. “The C.R. would re-fund all of that waste, fraud and abuse that DOGE has found,” he said, “which means the only way to fund the government is to fund it by individual spending bills.”\n\nAll these Democratic shutdown strategies carry risks. As Politico columnist Rachael Bade observed last week, Democrats may be walking into a trap if they follow through on this threat. If they do not work with Republicans to avert a shutdown, “Democrats would be embracing a tactic they’ve long shunned: holding the government hostage until they get what they want,” Bade writes. “There’s also the challenging message of explaining to Americans that you’re shutting the government down in order to save the government. The argument might make sense here in Washington, but it’s pretty damn confusing for every other American.”\n\nThe Trump White House is reveling in the chaos. One of the biggest takeaways from all this drama, staffers say, is that Kamala Harris’s 2024 defeat represents much more than a political loss for Democrats.\n\n“Everything that they did over the past four years has been quickly rolled back” by executive fiat, a Trump White House official told National Review. And their own base isn’t letting them off the hook on the anti-Trump resistance front. “They’re finally feeling pressures that I haven’t seen Democrats feel in a while, which is from their own people, who are saying: ‘You guys aren’t doing enough.’”\n\nThese optics aren’t lost on Democratic leaders who are clearly worried about taking the heat from voters for a shutdown. Last week, the Democratic Policy and Communications Committee sent an email to Democratic lawmakers in Washington advising them against making light of the rapidly approaching March 14 funding deadline. “Do not suggest Democrats can or are making unilateral decisions on government funding,” the memo said, according to the New York Times. “Do not get caught up in discussing the process of funding the government, make specific demands, or downplay a government shutdown.”\n\nFor now, at least, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) doesn’t sound like he’s spoiling for a shutdown fight. In a February 3 Dear Colleague letter, Jeffries said he has communicated to House GOP leaders that Democrats will support bipartisan legislation to fund the government on the condition that Republican efforts to defund certain agencies are “choked off.” Last week, he sought to place preemptive blame on Johnson in the event of a shutdown, telling reporters that “House Republicans have chosen to walk away” from good-faith negotiations.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) has struck a more forceful tone in a clear effort to rein in shutdown talk among his own members. “Democrats stand ready to support legislation that will prevent a government shutdown,” Schumer wrote in a February 10 Dear Colleague letter, which also insisted the onus is on Republicans “to get serious and work in a bipartisan fashion to avoid a Trump Shutdown.”","summary":"Trump is ‘shutting down the government already.

It may get the boost it needs as a $30 million investment is being made through a membership-only organization, dubbed the Pro-Life Venture Fund, Fox News Digital has learned. Key figures in the pro-life movement, including Leonard Leo, Ray Ruddy and Princeton Professor Robert George, sent a letter Tuesday morning to major pro-life organizations about the new venture fund, which is being chaired by David Bereit, the founder of the pro-life organization 40 Days for Life. \"We need to build more capacity and help meet the needs of those who are facing an unexpected pregnancy,\" Bereit told Fox News Digital in an interview. \"If we want to say to them, ‘You can do better than abortion,’ we need to say, ‘We will help you,’ and we need to provide the support, the resources and the tangible organizations that will walk with them.\" PRO-LIFE ACTIVIST PROSECUTED BY BIDEN DOJ REACTS TO TRUMP PARDON: 'I WANT TO GIVE HIM A HUG' As the executive vice president of the Federalist Society, Leo helped vet and recommend conservative judicial nominees, including those who later contributed to the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022. Ruddy co-founded the conservative news outlet Newsmax and has been deeply involved in financially supporting pro-life political action committees and candidates. George is a conservative philosopher and legal scholar at Princeton University who co-founded the American Principles Project. Rising as an influential voice in the pro-life movement, George has written extensively on the moral and philosophical arguments for opposing abortion. The group also announced the creation of the Life Leadership Conference, a members-only coalition featuring influencers and philanthropists \"who know how to achieve genuine victories.\" The memo states that while the Supreme Court has reversed the ruling of Roe v. Wade, \"today a whole new set of challenges\" faces the pro-life movement, which will require strong messaging to combat. Some of those challenges include combating the push to enshrine abortion into state constitutions. PRO-LIFE PROTESTERS COULD FACE UP TO 10 YEARS IN PRISON: ‘POLITICAL WITCH HUNT’ Voters in Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Montana, Nevada and New York all approved state-level abortion referendums last year. \"It should come as no surprise that, with the passage of time and changes in circumstance, old strategies for building public support and advancing the pro-life cause in legislatures and courts need to be rethought and, in some cases, revised,\" the memo states. \"Some groups have adapted and are charting winning strategies. Some are posting more losses than gains and are redefining what it means to win in ways that risk making the movement weaker and less effective.\" \"What’s more, the battle over abortion never was, and must never be allowed to become, simply about making sure the issue is delegated to the right government actors,\" the memo continued in part. \"The Life Leadership Conference is setting the bar higher. Our coalition will work tirelessly to provide genuine protection to unborn babies and practical assistance to pregnant women in need.\" As such, Beirut added the group's goal is to usher in \"a new era of life-saving action and culture-shaping innovation.\" PRO-LIFE PROTESTERS PARDONED BY TRUMP, FOX CONFIRMS Abortion emerged as a key issue in the 2024 election, with former Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party advocating for expanding federal abortion access.

However, they face opposition from red states and the fossil fuel sector, which are also contesting climate lawsuits aimed at holding them accountable, driven by state governments and youth environmental advocates.\n\nOn the first day of his second term, the US president reaffirmed his allegiance to the oil industry with a series of executive orders reversing environmental protections and a declaration to “drill, baby, drill.” Jamie Henn, director of the anti-oil and gas non-profit Fossil Free Media, noted that the intensity of his anti-environment policies has sparked an unprecedented focus on climate accountability.\n\n“Trump’s election has certainly energized the ‘make polluters pay’ movement,” remarked Henn, who has been at the forefront of the campaign for a decade.\n\nA growing number of state lawmakers are drafting proposals that would require oil companies to compensate for climate-related disasters, while legal firms are assisting governments in taking legal action against the industry. Additionally, youth activists are formulating a fresh legal challenge against the pro-fossil fuel policies of the Trump administration.\n\nNevertheless, industry interests are actively seeking to undermine these accountability efforts, potentially emboldened by Trump’s presidency.\n\nIn May, Vermont enacted a groundbreaking law imposing financial responsibility for climate damages on fossil fuel companies, followed by a similar statute passed in New York in December.\n\nThese policies mandate that oil companies bear the costs of climate impacts linked to their emissions. Known as “climate superfund” bills, they draw inspiration from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Superfund program.\n\nComparable legislation is on the table in states like Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, where a measure was introduced last week. A similar policy is also set to be put forth in California, following recent devastating wildfires that renewed calls for the initiative, which was considered last year.\n\nLawmakers in Minnesota and Oregon are also contemplating the introduction of climate superfund acts. Since inauguration day, activists and officials across a dozen states have expressed interest in pursuing similar measures, according to Henn.\n\n“People are clearly engaging with this message and approach right now,” said Henn. “It finally provides a means to respond to climate disasters, independent of federal involvement.”\n\nProgressives at the federal level introduced a climate superfund act last year. However, given the Republican control of the White House and Congress, its chances of passage are “less than zero,” stated Michael Gerrard, faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University.\n\nThe state-level laws are already experiencing legal challenges. This month, 22 red states alongside two oil trade associations filed a lawsuit aiming to block New York’s climate superfund law.\n\n“This bill represents an attempt by New York to encroach upon federal regulatory authority, which they are not entitled to do,” stated West Virginia Attorney General John B McCuskey, who led the lawsuit and represents a state that is a significant coal producer, in an interview with Fox News.\n\nIn late December, trade associations lodged a lawsuit against Vermont’s climate superfund act which, if successful, could endanger New York’s legislation as well.\n\nFossil fuel industry stakeholders were expected to contest the climate superfund laws regardless of whether Kamala Harris assumed the presidency, and Trump’s victory has further fortified their position. “They seem to feel more assured with executive support behind them,” noted Cassidy DiPaola, spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign.\n\nGerrard suggested it “would not be surprising” if Trump’s justice department filed briefs in favor of plaintiffs challenging the laws, which could shift the legal balance in their direction.\n\nAdditional legal challenges are anticipated, and if more states enact similar measures, they will likely encounter analogous lawsuits. However, Henn expresses confidence that the laws will endure.\n\n“Republicans might think they can intimidate local legislators or attorneys general from pursuing a polluter pays agenda, but they’re mistaken,” he remarked. “Public support for this approach is widespread. People are displeased with the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nIn the last decade, states and municipalities have filed over 30 lawsuits against fossil fuel companies, accusing them of consciously hiding the climate risks posed by their products while seeking damages for climate-related effects.\n\nAs Trump’s pro-fossil fuel strategies steer the US “in precisely the wrong direction” regarding the climate crisis, they will “inevitably provoke even more litigation,” Gerrard asserted. Michigan has announced intentions to file a lawsuit in the upcoming months, and others are expected to follow suit this year.\n\nThe fossil fuel sector represents a formidable adversary, with a long history of defending against lawsuits. Since January, courts have dismissed cases brought by New Jersey, New York, and a Maryland city and county, ruling that these states lacked the jurisdiction to pursue the matters.\n\nConversely, several decisions have favored the plaintiffs. In three rulings since spring 2023, the Supreme Court denied petitions from the fossil fuel industry to transfer lawsuits from the state courts, where they were initially filed, to federal courts, typically more favorable to industry interests.\n\nLast week, a Colorado court heard arguments pertaining to a lawsuit filed by the city of Boulder, a ruling that may have significant consequences for the future of these challenges.\n\nTrump has vowed to eradicate the surge of lawsuits, labeling them as “frivolous.” During his first term, his administration submitted influential briefs supporting the oil companies in these cases—an action the current justice department might echo. “It’s unequivocal where their priorities lie,” asserted Gerrard. “And should they submit briefs, it would benefit the defendants.”\n\nAlyssa Johl, vice-president and general counsel for the Center for Climate Integrity, which advocates for these lawsuits, remarked: “While the journey for these efforts is long, the direction is clear.”\n\n“As communities contend with the escalating and devastating outcomes of big oil’s long-lasting deceit, the demand for accountability has never been more pressing,” she added.\n\nYouth-led litigation\n\nA further climate-related legal movement gaining momentum is the youth-led challenges against state and federal agencies, accused of infringing upon constitutional rights through pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nAccording to Julia Olson, founder of the law firm Our Children’s Trust, Trump’s second term marks a pivotal opportunity for these lawsuits. While some legal practitioners will contest each rollback separately, her strategy aims to “achieve systemic change,” she stated.\n\nOn Wednesday, a US judge rejected a lawsuit filed by California youth against the EPA through Our Children’s Trust, arguing that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate any injury from the federal agency. Olson criticized the ruling, claiming the judge “misapplied the law.”\n\nOn the same day, the highly publicized Our Children’s Trust case, Juliana v United States—where 21 youths sued the federal government—faced a setback. In December, the plaintiffs petitioned the Supreme Court to send the case back for trial after it was dismissed. The US solicitor general has since filed an opposing brief; Olson noted that it “mischaracterized” their case.\n\nHowever, Our Children’s Trust has achieved significant victories in other instances. In December, the Montana Supreme Court upheld a landmark climate ruling favoring young plaintiffs, stating the state violated their constitutional right to a clean environment by permitting fossil fuel projects without consideration for global warming.\n\nThis triumph in a pro-fossil fuel red state, Olson said, fosters optimism that children may successfully sue against a conservative, oil and gas-inclined federal government.\n\nShe is currently pursuing another lawsuit against the Trump administration, whose “audacious” anti-environment policies could strengthen the challengers’ arguments, she believes.\n\n“These policies will endanger children… By clarifying his agenda, I think he helps underline that fact,” she asserted.","summary":"Donald Trump’s re-election has significantly accelerated efforts for climate accountability, according to activists.

So, why are New York Democrats still seemingly confused about how and why the presidential election turned out the way it did? \n\nMuch has been made about Donald Trump’s “remarkable gains” in the bluest of blue states, but you don’t have to look hard to see the answer — nearly a million fewer New Yorkers cast their ballots in the 2024 elections than 2020. Turnout keeps dropping in New York, and if our elected officials want to get serious about ending this voter apathy, they need to start making simple, common-sense changes that will finally give voters what they want.\n\nInstead of learning a lesson from November, state lawmakers tried and then, amid outcry, paused delays to the special election calendar that gave a stark appearance of meddling. Supporters claim the changes would provide more flexibility to schedule special elections to better coincide with regularly planned elections (i.e. Primary Day), and save taxpayers money. By prioritizing this scheme instead of logical, common-sense reforms widely supported by voters, it shows Albany as once again out of touch. his complaint has been recurring from voters — two-thirds say that Albany isn’t addressing these issues most important to them — and continues the feeling that voters don’t matter. Any wonder voter apathy is skyrocketing while turnout craters?\n\nNovember’s election showed the Empire State with one of the lowest voter turnouts in the entire United States. In New York, Vice President Kamala Harris received about half a million fewer votes in 2024 than President Biden did during a global pandemic. When the top of the ticket in New York is a foregone conclusion and the other races aren’t close, it’s no surprise; 40% failed to vote on all the races on the ballot (based on New York State Board of Elections results). \n\nIf New York is serious about turning the tide, our leaders in Albany need to embrace real reforms that would overhaul the process. \n\nThe good news is that some key Democrats have clearly gotten the message about doing things differently. State Chair Jay Jacobs clearly has noted that Dems will do better to focus on common sense, not cultural issues. Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado urged Dems to get away from their neoliberal agenda and again called for common sense. \n\nSo what is common sense? Rather than just consolidating primary days to June, let’s do something bold: Let independent voters have a voice in primaries like they do in nearly 40 other states, bringing 3.5 million disenfranchised voters to the polls. \n\nUnite NY has backed a handful of key reforms that would yield more choices for voters and give more power to voters’ voices and an overwhelming majority of New Yorkers support it. Let’s allow for citizen ballot initiatives, which 71% of New Yorkers support, like they do in nearly half of states, so the issues voters care about will be considered. \n\nBut most importantly, do away with career politicians and give three-fourths of New Yorkers what they want — term limits. Even Gov. Kathy Hochul called for this reform in 2022, before eventually backing off. That would be far more effective than her new big electoral reform of pushing to eliminate the Electoral College.\n\n2024 should serve as a wake-up call to the powers that be in New York. We need to give voters what they want. Hochul and her cohorts control all branches of a very unpopular statewide government, and every statewide office, but the 2024 elections should be a warning sign. Either shape up and embrace reforms or risk another Red Wave in 2026.","summary":"Donald Trump's gains in the bluest of blue states is a sign of voter apathy.

She reflected on her turbulent marriage and likened it to her sister Khloé’s challenging period with Lamar Odom, who battled addiction. The 44-year-old SKIMS founder, who had four children with the Yeezy mogul and was married to him from 2014 until 2022, claimed that the “Heartless” singer is “not the same person” she was married to more than ten years ago.\n\nBreaking News:\nKim Kardashian shares rare insight into her divorce from Kanye West: ‘They’re not the same person’.\nThe reality star and the rapper tied the knot in 2014 before parting ways eight years later. pic.twitter.com/0Uiyt4BjT8\n— Evans (@TrueNorthEvans) February 14, 2025\n\nKim went on to discuss her previous relationship with Kanye, saying, “When you don’t foresee something happening that really changes a person’s personality and then they’re not the same person and you can’t ever get that person back, but you can’t live with the new person.” As Kim emphasized, “I get it.” The mother of four, who shares children with Kanye (North, 11, Saint, 9, Chicago, 7, and Psalm, 5), opened up about the breakdown of her second marriage in a confessional moment.\n\nShe looked at the camera and said: “It’s tougher when you don’t want your marriage to end for personal reasons but circumstances change that force your marriage to end.” The SKKN beauty mogul went on: “When you weren’t planning on that and that’s not really the outcome you want but there’s no other option, I think it makes it harder to get over.”\n\nHowever, her ‘Kanye is not the same man’ gave rise to a wave of speculations around Kanye’s clone theories. Kanye West recently caused a commotion on social media once more, stoking claims that he is a “clone.”\n\nThe 47-year-old musician, who was banned last year, made a comeback to X (previously Twitter) with a series of strange messages that boasted about his wealth, celebrated Donald Trump’s reelection, and even made fun of Taylor Swift.\n\nHe wrote, “The world is so lucky to have me,” claiming that despite his financial losses in 2022, he would soon be worth $2.77 billion. The Runaway hitmaker went on to boast about his money, saying, “I’m rich,” while joking that he might be a “clone.” Whatever the f**k I want, I can say it. His explicit comment about Harris, referring to her 2024 election defeat to Trump, was one of his most contentious remarks. Before Kamala lost, I wanted to f**k her. Through Page Six, he posted a now-deleted tweet that read, “I don’t f**k losers anymore.”\n\nRecently, Kanye West has posted abhorrent content as a “tweet,” in the form of declaring himself a Nazi, and begging to free the felonious “Mrs. Puff” from the cartoon “SpongeBob SquarePants” from prison. It is to be duly noted that these tweets should not be viewed as separate.\n— aitherIac (@aitheriac) February 17, 2025\n\nBest known for her Laguna Beach reality TV career, Kristin Cavallari has drawn attention for reasons that go well beyond her Hollywood origins, including Kanye. Cavallari revealed her interest in conspiracy theories in the October 14 episode of her podcast Let’s Be Honest, where she made some startling allegations regarding Britney Spears and Kanye West, two of the greatest names in the music business.\n\nCavallari clarified why she thinks Kanye’s abrupt withdrawal from the public eye and subsequent change in look upon his return raise red flags. She cited the rapper’s previous remarks in which he threatened that it wouldn’t be him if he ever vanished and returned in a different form. He had left. He’s gone! Remember how he briefly disappeared from the face of the planet? Could you take a look at him? Look at old pictures of him. It isn’t the same f—ing individual. It isn’t!\n\nGiven Kanye’s history of publicly criticizing influential people, she speculated that secret societies like the Illuminati might be responsible for this shift. After upsetting influential people, Cavallari suggested that these organizations may have taken his position in order to limit his impact.\n\nKristin Cavallari on Kanye West as a clone… pic.twitter.com/tXRasTYYl1\n— CtrlAltDelete (@TakingoutTrash7) October 17, 2024\n\nFans also remember Kanye saying, “If I go away and I come back and I look different, that is not me.” Cavallari’s comments ignited a heated debate on social media. One fan added, “SAVE KRISTIN!!! She’s speaking the truth!!!! PROTECT HER AT ALL COSTS!!” Another commenter voiced support, saying, “I am backing that claim.”\n\nPreviously, Kanye and his partner Bianca Censori’s recent Grammy appearance also made the headlines. Censori was seen wearing ‘almost nothing’ and from lip-readers to critics predicted that it was Kanye who forced her to do so. Some even felt that the hip-hop sensation was using Censori as a PR stunt. What resurfaced later was how Kanye had issues with his ex-spouse Kim, who was wearing a body-hugging dress for the Met Gala 2019.\n\nFans, hence, predicted that such a drastic change was unbelievable, and what we see now is definitely not the ‘old’ Kanye.","summary":"Amid social media ban and divorce rumors, past theories on Kanye West’s clone resurface.

A February 6 Capitol Weekly poll found that only 11 percent of California voters believe the Democratic Party has effectively opposed the Trump administration, while 79 percent disagreed. Even among Democrats, just 19 percent expressed confidence in their party, with 68 percent saying it has fallen short. The survey of 1,198 voters also asked for a one-word description of the Democratic Party, with the most common responses being \"lost,\" \"ineffective\" and \"weak.\"Democratic governor Gavin Newsom is facing a recall bid after wildfires in Los Angeles burned over 47,900 acres, destroyed more than 16,250 homes and businesses, and killed 29 people. The recall petition, organized by Saving California, accuses Newsom of \"gross mismanagement during the Los Angeles County fires,\" saying that \"inadequate resources and delayed responses left communities devastated.\"California saw the largest swing toward the Republicans of any state in the 2024 presidential election compared with 2020, moving 12 percentage points toward Trump.What To KnowBianco launched his campaign for California governor on Monday at an event in Riverside.As he announced his candidacy, he criticized California's leadership, arguing that the state is on the wrong track because of decades of failed Democratic policies. He also emphasized the need for lower living costs, affordable housing, reliable energy, sufficient water for agriculture, lower taxes, and government transparency, and positioned himself as a leader who would cut through government red tape and challenge the political establishment in California.He is one of more than half-dozen candidates who have officially announced that they are running for California governor. The others include former Democratic mayor of Los Angeles, Antonio Villaraigosa, former speaker of the California State Assembly, Toni Atkins, the state's current lieutenant governor, Eleni Kounalakis, as well as California State Superintendent of Public Instruction, Tony Thurmond, and former state controller, Betty Yee.Meanwhile, former representative Katie Porter is reportedly considering a run for governor after her unsuccessful Senate bid last year, while former health and human services secretary Xavier Becerra is also seen as a potential candidate. On the Republican side, former Fox News host and conservative commentator Steve Hilton is weighing a gubernatorial run, according to Fox News.There are also rumors that former vice president Kamala Harris is considering a run. According to Politico, she instructed her advisers to keep her options open for either a 2026 gubernatorial campaign in her home state or a presidential bid in 2028.\"I am staying in the fight,\" she repeated during phone calls.Harris has not said if she intends to run. However, if she decides to do so, she could significantly shake things up in a race where there is currently no clear front-runner among the official candidates.An October UC Berkeley/Los Angeles Times poll showed Kamala Harris with a strong lead in the 2026 California gubernatorial race, with 72 percent of Democrats likely to support her. While she has little backing from Republicans (8 percent) and moderate support from independent voters (38 percent), Democrats hold a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage in the state. Pressure for Harris to run increased after California Attorney General Rob Bonta endorsed her earlier this month, calling her a \"field-clearing\" candidate.Former Trump aide Richard Grenell told reporters late last week that he would consider running if Harris enters the race.\"If Kamala Harris runs for governor, I believe that she has such baggage and hundreds of millions of dollars in educating the voters of how terrible she is, that it's a new day in California and that the Republican actually has a shot,\" he said. \"And I wouldn't say no [to running].\"Who Is Chad Bianco?Bianco has been Riverside County sheriff since 2018, and was reelected in 2022. He has built a statewide profile as a vocal critic of Newsom and the state legislature's Democratic supermajority.He has also has accused the Democrats of going easy on criminals, driving California's Proposition 36 to a landslide victory in last November's election. The measure, which took effect in December, enforces tougher penalties and longer sentences for certain drug and theft crimes in the state.He has also drawn headlines for his refusal to enforce potential vaccine mandates for Sheriff's Department employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, and a civil rights investigation into his department by state prosecutors, which Bianco has said is politically motivated.Bianco has also been a vocal Trump supporter, endorsing him in the November election while joking: \"I think it's time we put a felon in the White House. Trump 2024, baby.\"Last fall, he stood by his claim that his deputies may have thwarted an assassination attempt on Trump, despite federal law enforcement refuting it.Bianco has been a vocal critic of illegal immigration and the Biden administration's handling of the southern border. However, despite previously aligning with Republicans denouncing migrant flows, he recently clarified that his deputies will not engage in immigration enforcement, pushing back on claims that his personnel were actively involved in such operations in violation of state law, which designates California a sanctuary state.As a sanctuary state, law enforcement in California are prohibited from using resources to assist in federal immigration enforcement. But Trump's border czar, Tom Homan, has warned that local law enforcement officials who refuse to cooperate with ICE agents on deportations will face federal prosecution.Bianco stated that he would do everything possible—within the limits of California's sanctuary state laws—to work with ICE in deporting individuals held in jails.What People Are SayingAnnouncing his candidacy, Chad Bianco said: \"It is only our Democrat elected officials who are responsible for the decline of California. What is it they have given us? Rampant crime, higher taxes, the highest cost of living in our nation, tent encampments in every major city, more fentanyl deaths, catastrophic fires, a broken home insurance market and people across our state are struggling to afford groceries and gas. Californians deserve better.\"As Californians we want leadership that actually cares about the cost of living…and leaders who will do something about it.\"We want homes we can afford. We want air conditioning when it's hot, not rolling blackouts. We want water for the crops and animals that feed us. We want the opportunity to achieve the California Dream, not be prevented from it because of red tape and regulation from government. We want honesty and transparency from our elected officials. We want lower taxes and less government waste. We want sanity restored and common sense to prevail.\"I am running for governor because our beautiful state—which I absolutely love—is heading down the wrong track and has been for years. Everyone knows it, except those sitting in the Sacramento echo chamber. For decades the party in complete control of our state government has tried the same failed ideas and implemented the same failed policies.\"What Happens NextCalifornia will elect its next governor in 2026 when Newsom's term ends. Newsom is believed to be a contender for the 2028 Democratic nomination for president. However, he has not yet expressed any desire to run.In November, Newsom had +550 odds of becoming the next president, according to SportsBettingDime, which amounts to a 15 percent chance. Harris had +2500 odds, or a 4 percent chance.","summary":"Riverside County sheriff Chad Bianco is the first major Republican to announce a bid for California governor.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/cahd-bianco-california-governor-candidates-2032564","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2590409/chad-bianco.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 13:08:56","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.189},{"id":291771664,"title":"Forbes Daily: Crypto Wants A Seat At The Trump Administration’s Table","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nNigerian billionaire Aliko Dangote built the largest petroleum refinery in Africa, and his net worth has nearly doubled.

Searches for flights to popular destinations in the Asian country increased as much as 65% last spring after the location was announced. The InterContinental Phuket Resort’s sales director told Forbes he expects “a surge in interest” for luxury travel to the country, as set-jetting—or traveling because of a film or TV show—continues to grow in popularity.\n\nDAILY COVER STORY\n\nThe Best Small Businesses To Buy Now\n\nMIKE KEMP/GETTY IMAGES\n\nTOPLINE In 2024, small business buyers weren’t looking for dessert. Instead, they were looking to sweat. Fitness businesses got more expensive and ice cream shops got cheaper, according to data from BizBuySell, an online marketplace for small businesses and a division of Arlington, Virginia-based CoStar Group.\n\nGyms saw their price-to-revenue multiples jump from 0.72x to 0.85x, an 18% year-over-year increase, the biggest gain among 23 small business sectors BizBuySell tracks that had greater than the median number of transactions in both 2023 and 2024. Ice cream shops and hair salons, meanwhile, tied for the worst performance, with both seeing their price-to-revenue multiples drop by 4% from 2023 to 2024.\n\nPrice-to-revenues or sales, represents the amount acquirers are willing to pay as a multiple of an enterprise’s annual revenues. While many small businesses routinely change hands at less than one times annual sales, the large publicly traded companies in the S&P 500 index trade for an average of more than 3 times revenues.\n\nThe highest price-to-sales ratio among the 9,530 deals that BizBuySell surveyed in 2024 came from bed-and-breakfast establishments which changed hands for a median price of $1.5 million, which was an average of 2.76 times annual revenues. The lowest multiples came from car dealerships, which sold for 0.23 times revenues and had a median sales price of $600,000.\n\nThe market shift evident in BizBuySell’s 2024 report reflects a change in how people have been approaching fitness. U.S. health club memberships topped 70 million in 2023 for the first time, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association.\n\nWHY IT MATTERS “Buying a small business is becoming a more popular path to entrepreneurship, but finding reliable data on what businesses are worth isn’t easy,” says Forbes reporter Brandon Kochkodin. “Unlike stocks, which trade on public exchanges with clear valuations, small business sales are private and often opaque. BizBuySell’s data offers a rare look at how different industries are trending and what buyers are willing to pay.”\n\n“This year’s report shows a clear shift toward health and wellness, while some traditional businesses are losing appeal. But trends change, and buyers still need to look beyond topline numbers to understand what a business is really worth.”\n\nMORE Why Is Small Business Administration Lending Suddenly Surging?\n\nFACTS + COMMENTS\n\nSports betting (and its advertisements) has become ubiquitous since the Supreme Court legalized state-sponsored gambling in 2018.

They are being challenged by red states and the fossil fuel industry, which are also fighting against accountability-focused climate lawsuits waged by governments and youth environmentalists.\n\nOn day one of his second term, the US president affirmed his loyalty to the oil industry with a spate of executive actions to roll back environmental protections and a pledge to “drill, baby, drill”. The ferocity of his anti-environment agenda has inspired unprecedented interest in climate accountability, said Jamie Henn, director of the anti-oil and gas non-profit Fossil Free Media.\n\n“I think Trump’s election has turbocharged the ‘make polluters pay’ movement,” said Henn, who has been a leader in the campaign for a decade.\n\nMore state lawmakers are writing legislative proposals to force oil companies to pay for climate disasters, while law firms are helping governments sue the industry. And youth activists are working on a new legal challenge to the Trump administration’s pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nIndustry interests, however, are also attempting to kill those accountability efforts – and Trump may embolden them.\n\nThe state of Vermont in May passed a first-of-its-kind law holding fossil fuel firms financially responsible for climate damages and New York passed a similar measure in December.\n\nThe policies force oil companies to pay for climate impacts to which their emissions have contributed. Known as “climate superfund” bills, they are loosely modeled on the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Superfund program.\n\nSimilar bills are being considered in Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts, and now Rhode Island, where a measure was introduced last week. A policy will also soon be introduced in California, where recent deadly wildfires have revived the call for the proposal after one was weighed last year.\n\nMinnesota and Oregon lawmakers are also considering introducing climate superfund acts. And since inauguration day, activists and officials in a dozen other states have expressed interest in doing the same, said Henn.\n\n“I think people are really latching onto this message and this approach right now,” Henn said. “It finally gives people a way to respond to climate disasters, and it’s something that we can do without the federal government.”\n\nProgressives introduced a federal climate superfund act last year. But with Republicans in control of the White House and both branches of Congress, it has a “less than zero chance of passing”, said Michael Gerrard, the faculty director of the Sabin center for climate change law at Columbia University.\n\nThe state laws are already facing pushback in the courts. This month, 22 red states and two oil trade groups sued to block New York’s climate superfund law.\n\n“This bill is an attempt by New York to step into the shoes of the federal government to regulate something that they have absolutely no business regulating,” West Virginia attorney general John B McCuskey, who led the suit and whose state is a top coal producer, told Fox News.\n\nIn late December, trade groups also filed a lawsuit against Vermont’s climate superfund act which, if successful, could potentially topple New York’s law.\n\nFossil fuel interests were expected to challenge the climate superfund laws even if Kamala Harris was elected president and have been boosted by Trump’s win. “I think [they] feel like they have more of a shot with the executive backing them,” said Cassidy DiPaola, spokesperson for the Make Polluters Pay campaign.\n\nIt “would not be shocking” if Trump’s justice department were to file briefs in support of plaintiffs fighting the laws, said Gerrard, which could tip the scales in their favor.\n\nMore legal challenges may also be on the way, and if additional states pass similar policies, they are expected to face similar lawsuits. But Henn says he is confident the laws will prevail.\n\n“I think Republicans think that they’re going to be able to just scare off local legislators or local attorneys general from pursuing a polluter pays agenda, but I think they’re wrong,” he said. “We have widespread public support for this approach. People don’t like the fossil fuel industry.”\n\nOver the last decade, states and municipalities have also brought more than 30 lawsuits against fossil fuel interests, accusing them of intentionally covering up the climate risks of their products while seeking damages for climate impacts.\n\nAs Trump’s pro-fossil fuel policies move the US in “precisely the wrong direction” on the climate crisis, they will “surely inspire yet more litigation”, said Gerrard. Michigan has announced plans to file a suit in the coming months, and more are likely to be rolled out this year.\n\nThe cases face a formidable opponent in the fossil fuel industry, which has long attempted to fend off the lawsuits. Since January, courts have dismissed litigation filed by New Jersey, New York, and a Maryland city and county, saying the states lacked jurisdiction to hear the cases.\n\nOther decisions have been positive for the plaintiffs. In three decisions since spring 2023, the supreme court turned down petitions from the fossil fuel industry to move the venue of the lawsuits from the state courts where they were originally filed, to federal courts which are seen as more friendly to the industry.\n\nLast week, a court in Colorado heard arguments over the same issue in a lawsuit filed by the city of Boulder. The outcome will have major implications for the future of the challenge.\n\nTrump has pledged to put an end to the wave of lawsuits, which he has called “frivolous”. During his first term, his administration filed influential briefs in the cases supporting the oil companies – something his justice department could do again. “It’s clear where their allegiances are,” said Gerrard. “And if they file briefs that would be good for the defendants.”\n\nAlyssa Johl, vice-president and general counsel of the Center for Climate Integrity, which tracks and supports the lawsuits, said: “There is still a long road ahead for these efforts, but the path forward is clear.”\n\n“As communities grapple with the increasingly devastating consequences of big oil’s decades-long deception, the need for accountability is greater than ever,” she said.\n\nYouth-led litigation\n\nAnother climate-focused legal movement that is gaining steam: youth-led challenges against state and federal government agencies, for allegedly violating constitutional rights with pro-fossil fuel policies.\n\nTrump’s second term presents an important moment for these lawsuits, said Julia Olson, founder of the law firm Our Children’s Trust, which brought the litigation. While some lawyers will fight each rollback individually, her strategy could “secure systemic change”. she said.\n\nOn Wednesday, a US judge rejected an Our Children’s Trust suit filed by California youth against the EPA, saying the challengers failed to show that they had been injured by the federal body. Olson said the judge “misapplied the law”.\n\nThat same day, the most well-known Our Children’s Trust case, Juliana v United States – in which 21 young people sued the federal government – suffered a blow. In December, the plaintiffs filed a petition with the supreme court to send the case back to trial after it was tossed out. The US solicitor general has now filed a brief opposing their petition; Olson said it “mischaracterized” the case.\n\nOur Children’s Trust’s lawsuits have in other instances seen major victories. In December, Montana’s supreme court upheld a landmark climate ruling in favor of young plaintiffs, which said the state was violating youths’ constitutional right to a clean environment by permitting fossil fuel projects with no regard for global warming.\n\nThat victory in a pro-fossil fuel red state, said Olson, inspires hope that children could win a lawsuit against a conservative, oil and gas-friendly federal government.\n\nShe is working on another lawsuit against the Trump administration, whose “brazen” anti-environment agenda could bolster the challengers’ arguments, she said.\n\n“These policies will kill children … and by making his agenda obvious, I think that he helps us make that clear.”","summary":"‘Make polluters pay’ laws, led by blue states AGs, and accountability suits will be a major front for climate litigation for the coming years\n\nDonald Trump’s re-election has “turbocharged” climate accountability efforts including laws which aim to force greenhouse gas emitters to pay damages for fueling dangerous global warming, say activists.\n\nThese “make polluters pay” laws, led by blue states’ attorneys general, and climate accountability lawsuits will be a major front for climate litigation in the coming months and years.

Focus on persuasion, not policy","text":"Ontario residents will soon elect a new government, and Canadians should expect a federal election this spring.\n\nElections matter. They are opportunities for democracies to enact the bedrock principle that leaders are accountable to the citizenry — and for citizens to examine how communication practices inhibit or enhance democratic life.\n\nFor politicians, elections pose a specific, clear communication challenge: How does a politician persuade a voter? \n\nPersuade voters\n\nSuccess in an election requires persuasion. Too often, though, politicians misunderstand the process of persuasion. The most common mistake is to believe that explaining a specific policy proposal will influence voters. \n\nOntario Liberal Leader Bonnie Crombie began her campaign, for example, touting platform doors for Toronto subway stops. This is a sure sign Crombie will fail to persuade a plurality of voters. \n\nWhy? Because Crombie is mistakenly thinking about communication as a process of transmitting information — transmit the right information or policy idea and the public will nod in agreement. That’s not how communication works. \n\nScience communicators call this the “deficit model” of communication (the public lacks information; once they get it, they change their behaviour). \n\nMotivate voters; control the narrative\n\nThere’s little evidence that information sharing is persuasive, and popular policy positions routinely fail to persuade voters (a casual look at the last presidential election in the United States demonstrates this). Politicians, of course, want to talk about policy, but policy is how one governs — not how one persuades. \n\nPoliticians need to motivate voters, not inform them. Ancient orators like Demosthenes and Cicero knew this, as did former U.S. president Barack Obama and even authoritarian leaders like Hugo Chavez. \n\nExplaining policy positions is not how to win an election.\n\nCrombie’s proposal for platform edge doors reveals a deeper communication problem. A policy like this implies a frame, or a map, through which people are invited to see the world. \n\nCrombie’s policy proposal suggests that the world is a dangerous place. If we accept that frame, then we are likely to feel fear for our safety and imagine the government as our protector — this is the likely effect of her policy talk. \n\nThis is exactly the frame that conservative politicians often promote. In elections, the party that controls the frame wins. \n\nThe frame implied by any policy matters more than the content of the policy in an election. Another way to understand the power of language is to think of a simple phrase like “tax relief.” For years, left-leaning political parties have advocated for middle class “tax relief.” \n\nBut this frame assumes that taxes are a burdensome infringement (the word “relief” signifies some burden that we need relief from). That is the assumption of right-leaning political parties. \n\nThe more politicians on the left continue to portray taxes this way, the more persuasive the parties on the right become.\n\nWhose values?\n\nThe important lesson here is that politicians need to have the conversation they want, not the conversation their opponents want. Donald Trump’s most powerful communication skill is forcing the media and his opponents onto his conversational terrain. \n\nTrump’s oppenent, Kamala Harris, tried to talk values. But her messaging was often too confusing, too complex and too varied to be persuasive, especially compared to Trump’s repetitive drumbeat of value-based accusations.\n\nConsider the broader frame that government’s job is to help the economy. Some have argued “the economy” is a fiction, a rhetorical construction that suits right-leaning political parties. Whenever the left advocates for a policy that intends to help “the economy” (a higher minimum wage, for example), they recirculate and reaffirm a conservative frame.\n\n Read more:\n Why Donald Trump's words work, and what to do about it\n\nAt the core of these frames are often a set of values: freedom is good, government can’t be trusted, the economy matters most. Messaging that focuses on why is much more effective than messaging that focuses on what and how.\n\nWhen politicians talk about values more than they provide information, they are more likely to get attention and cause reactions. Values talk — about what’s good or bad, right or wrong — tends to target the more primal, limbic part of our brain, which can cause people to feel motivated to act. \n\nCrombie, therefore, needs to explicitly articulate her values, why she is running for office, and make sure to implicitly frame any policy suggestion through attention to those values. Right now, she is implying conservative values through liberal policies — that won’t work.\n\nStories reinforce the frame\n\nValues tend to come wrapped in the stories we tell about ourselves and our moment. Marshall Ganz, Harvard sociologist and community organizer, trained Barack Obama’s campaign volunteers in a form of storytelling, based on values, that was intended to motivate people. \n\nGood stories have villains and heroes, along with challenges or choices. Most importantly, good stories create a feeling of identification — a “we” that navigates a set of challenges or choices. \n\nStories that make people feel hope, confidence, solidarity, anger and urgency are particularly adept at motivation. And these stories are also able to reinforce the frame through which we view the world, causing a story to “feel true” for voters even if it contains factual inaccuracies. \n\nThe story that resonates most powerfully creates a sense of identification and makes a specific frame seem true drives electoral outcomes.\n\nVision of the future\n\nThe very best stories have a clear vision of the future. Too often politicians fixate on, and lament, problems. All of that problem talk can inhibit motivation. A clear picture of an ideal future shows the citizenry how a story ends. \n\nThese imagined futures can be inspiring in ways that drive action. Painting a compelling tomorrow is a central part of political persuasion.\n\nThese aspects of persuasion have been true for centuries. Our moment, however, adds a complicating element — our social media systems.\n\nScholars of rhetoric have long known that repetition is persuasive. Social media amplifies the power of persuasion. This might not improve democratic decision-making, but politicians must still recognize how slogans, memes and sound bites all become the resources for repetition and the grounds in which specific frames or stories begin to dominate conversations. \n\nControlling what gets repeated and using figures that are repeatable are necessary contemporary considerations. \n\nTo be clear, if you want to win an election: control the frame, talk about values more than policy, tell a compelling story, paint a bright future, and find ways to repeat, repeat, repeat.","summary":"Want to win an election?

Michelle and Barack are living separate lives, and Barack is f------ Jennifer Aniston,\" one podcaster said, noting the story \"obviously could be made up.\" \n\nA month earlier, a Reddit user had asked: \"Anyone else hear that Obama and Jennifer Aniston are f------?\"The \"goss\" got so much traction Aniston was then forced to publicly deny any untoward relationship with the former leader of the free world, 63. \n\n\"That is absolutely untrue,\" the Friends sta, 56, insisted in an October visit to her pal Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show. \"There is no truth.\" \n\nAn insider said Aniston was \"appalled\" by the rumors and thought the show would provide a \"safe haven\" for her to stop them. \n\nIt worked – for a time. \n\nBut when Michelle, 61, failed to attend two high-profile events with her husband of 32 years in January – former President Jimmy Carter's funeral and President Donald Trump's Inauguration – whispers of marital discord exploded.\n\n\"There have been rumblings for months of trouble in their marriage,\" our source said. \"There's little doubt they've been living separate lives.\"Unlike Aniston, the Obamas haven't engaged in the drama. In fact, it's been business as usual for the pair, who exchanged sweet messages on social media on January 17 as Barack wished his wife a happy birthday, telling her: \"You fill every room with warmth, wisdom, humor and grace and you look good doing it. I'm so lucky to be able to take on life's adventures with you. Love you!\" \n\nShe responded in a reply online: \"Love you, honey,\" with heart and kissy-face emojis.\n\nOutlets from Washington, D.C., to L.A., however, have continued to report on a potential Obamas split. \n\nFormer View host Meghan McCain opined on the January 22 episode of her “Citizen McCain” podcast by saying: \"Very serious journalists telling me that they're hearing that the Obama divorce rumors are true.\" \n\nHer guest, Tara Palmeri, a senior political correspondent for Puck concurred: \"I've certainly heard it for a while, even before Michelle said she wasn't coming to the inauguration.\"\n\nOther insiders continued to connect the former commander-in-chief with the Morning Show star Instagrammer Jessica Reed Krans even claimed on her Substack she'd received a direct message with very specific information on the Obamas' alleged split.Barack, her follower alleged, \"is with Jennifer Aniston. My old manager, now a friend, is connected to her inner circle. At a gathering with Jennifer's friends, the affair came up casually, Jennifer herself admitted it. They were sitting with a psychic, which makes it sound surreal, but it's definitely not a secret among her closest friends.\"\n\nThe actress has admitted she and the Obamas are not strangers. \n\n\"I've met him once. I know Michelle more than him,\" she told Jimmy in October. \n\nShe also donated $2,300 to the former POTUS’ presidential campaign in 2007 and appeared alongside him and other stars in a 'We Can End Gun Violence' campaign in 2015 following a mass shooting. \n\nAnd Aniston and Michelle both appeared on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show on her 60th birthday in 2018.\n\nOnce apolitical, in recent election cycles, Aniston has been more vocal. \n\nIn 2016, she attended a fundraiser for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton; and in October, she announced she'd \"very proudly voted for Kamala Harris\" for president. \n\n\"She's long admired the work Barack has done,\" our insider said, adding: \"And how he led the country and what an eloquent speaker he is.\" \n\nMeanwhile, the former president has spent more time in entertainment circles since he and Michelle left the White House in 2017. \n\nIn 2018, they founded a production company, Higher Ground, which released an Oscar-winning documentary and inked a lucrative Netflix deal (recent projects include the 2023 Julia Roberts thriller Leave the World Behind). \n\nTheir daughters also live in L.A.: Harvard-educated Malia, 26, is a writer-director, Sasha, 23, graduated from USC in 2023. \n\n\"Barack has a lot of A-list friends and enjoys a bit of the spotlight himself,\" revealed our source.After all, she's been on both sides of affair scandals. \n\nYears after her 2005 divorce from Brad Pitt, 61, the F1 star and future ex-wife No. 2, Angelina Jolie, 49, both admitted they \"fell in love\" while shooting Mr. & Mrs. Smith while he was still married to Aniston – a betrayal that has haunted her to this day.\n\nLater, the Lola Vie haircare founder had to battle accusations that she stole her Wanderlust costar Justin Theroux, 53, her husband from 2015 to 2018 – from his girlfriend of 14 years, Heidi Bivens, 48. \n\n\"Nothing happened on that movie,\" Aniston told Good Morning America in 2012, insisting: \"We were just friends.\"\n\nThe claims the Emmy winner is more than friends with the ex-prez are \"annoying\" to Michelle, our insider said. \n\nSince leaving D.C., the Princeton and Harvard-educated attorney has been focused on reclaiming her life apart from her husband. \n\n\"She was never that interested in politics,\" the insider added. \n\n\"She did her part supporting Barack during his presidency, and now it's her turn to shine. The kids are grown and more independent, and now she wants to live her life.\" \n\nShe's never denied that her relationship is far from perfect. \n\n\"I don't want people looking at me and Barack like, ‘hashtag couple goals,'\" Michelle said in 2024, adding \"there are some broken things that happen even in the best of marriages\".\n\nShe added: \"It's the choice to figure it out, not to quit when it gets hard.\"","summary":"Jennifer Aniston has tackled the Barack Obama affair rumors — as Michelle Obama skips two major political events.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/jennifer-aniston-barack-obama-affair-rumors-buzz/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/0Bfw8PqIe/0x0/jennifer-aniston-barack-obama-affair-rumors-buzz-1739553104078.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 11:30:00","author":"Radar Staff","authors":["Radar Staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":291765522,"title":"He’s Hot. He’s “Dangerous.” He Never Stops Talking. Is the Answer to Trump Hiding in Plain Sight?","text":"It is Jan. 19—the last day of Joe Biden’s presidency, and the eve of a new one no one can quite fathom yet—and Hasan Piker is preparing for the end of the world.\n\nAs he almost always is, Piker is live on Twitch. He is at home in West Hollywood, in a secondary bedroom he has turned into a broadcasting booth. The boiling overhead studio lights illuminate the scene. Piker is in the center of the frame, his peripheral vision swallowed up by three chunky computer monitors. Behind him is a clutter of socialist potpourri: Cuban and Gazan flags draped over a minifridge packed with Dr Pepper Zero Sugar, a cardboard cutout of Bernie Sanders blocking sunlight from a window, and a plastic purple skull capped with a furry Soviet ushanka.\n\nThere is not much left to be said at the dawn of the second Trump administration, so Piker ends his stream in relative silence, watching highlights from the weekend’s Saturday Night Live. The thousands of viewers in his chat, off to the screen on his right, pump out more messages than anyone could possibly read. A few moments later, Piker bids them good night.\n\n“I’ll be suited up and booted up to cover the Trump inauguration, the first day of the apocalypse,” Piker says. “I love you all. And I’ll see you tomorrow.\n\nFor nearly a decade now, Piker, who streams under the name HasanAbi, has been one of the most famous political commentators in America. If you’re a certain type of mainstream liberal—or a not-very-online moderate or conservative, for that matter—you may not have heard of him. His precise class of celebrity is difficult to describe, but in some respects, he has inherited the role of the agenda-setting television pundit for a generation that ditched the traditional medium long ago, if it ever knew it at all. Piker streams every day, weekends and holidays included. Outside of a few bathroom breaks, he’s typically on-camera, by himself, for eight hours uninterrupted. Tens of thousands, sometimes many more, follow along.\n\nOther channels on Twitch, the Amazon-owned livestreaming platform, tend to focus on Fortnite stunts and other video game feeds. Piker doesn’t play too many video games live. Instead, for the most part, his broadcasts consist of him clicking around the huge number of tabs compressed at the top of his Chrome browser. Piker ping-pongs between them, offering mordant insights on irritating New York Times columns, Elon Musk tweets, and Jesse Watters meltdowns. His style is open-ended and rich with digressions—nothing canned, no artifice—and regardless of what he’s currently roasting, Piker is assertively unscripted. Like many of us, he reacts to the bamboozling deterioration of 21st-century life in real time. Unlike most of us, he does it in front of an enormous audience, every day, with a chronic exasperation perfectly tuned for the moment.\n\nIt’s been a winning formula, and Piker seems to conquer a new benchmark every year. In 2020, back when he was still getting his feet wet on the platform, his stream peaked at 230,000 concurrent viewers while he covered Biden’s slim victory over Donald Trump, making him the sixth-most-watched source of election coverage across YouTube and Twitch. Four years later, Piker broke that record when 313,000 people watched him analyze the defeat of Kamala Harris. In a digital news apparatus that is sharply breaking right, Piker is one of the only leftists standing. Of the 10 most watched pundits streaming on Election Day, he outpaced Tucker Carlson and, notably, Trump operative Charlie Kirk, who worked with the campaign to turn out millennial and Gen Z men. Many young male liberals, supposedly an endangered species, have determined that the more tempered and polite avenues of left-leaning media—the nightly slate at MSNBC, the edgeless punch lines of late night—leave them cold. Instead, they have found a common movement with this 33-year-old socialist dicking around on his computer.\n\nIn that sense, Piker is in possession of one thing the Democrats desperately want now more than ever. Shortly after the presidential election, when it became clear that the party was hemorrhaging young men to the right, the commentariat bemoaned the absence of a “liberal Joe Rogan”—as in, an alternative-media figure who commands significant clout within a loose contingency of disengaged males and happens to be aligned with an overarching left-of-center project. Who could be a bulwark against an increasingly radicalized Adin Ross, Dave Portnoy, and Theo Von?\n\nWell, here is Piker. He stands 6-foot-4, with a sharp jawline and ripples of coiled muscle. He is conversant in bodybuilding, gaming, anime, professional wrestling, and every other interest that tends to make up the media diet of boys of a certain age. His bulge-and-Calvins thirst traps have started libidinal riots online. According to an unofficial census conducted by his community in 2024, his viewership is about two-thirds men. (Slim majorities are white and hold a college degree, while 30 percent reported that they hadn’t yet lost their virginity.) In the past year, he has welcomed both former Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to the stream. Sanders, 50 years Piker’s senior, passed through a week before the inauguration and thanked him for his role in the “revolution of media.” Even the Pod Save America podcast, staffed by former Obama flacks who’ve long advocated for a more institutional brand of progressivism, hosted Piker and listened patiently while he ripped the party a new one.\n\nAll this access has given Piker’s show a sense of beltway authority that it never quite had during the Biden era—evidence of a fledgling effort to make him more central to Democratic messaging. The Democrats, it seems, have found their man.\n\nJust one little problem with that. Piker didn’t endorse Biden at the dawn of the 2024 cycle. Then he didn’t endorse Kamala Harris either. Resting on a sheathed samurai sword, near the rear of his streaming setup, is a MAGA hat. Piker wears it on the rare occasions he approves of a Trump decision. On one recent occasion, he slipped it on when the incoming administration had a hand in brokering a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. Piker is pro–Palestinian liberation, pro-immigrant, pro-trans, pro-choice, and unapologetically himself. Some of this has brought accusations of antisemitism and more, all of which he strongly denies but has lately found Piker in an uncharacteristically defensive posture. His take-no-prisoners approach makes everyone—but especially Democrats—uneasy. For a while, a staffer for Ocasio-Cortez suggested the congresswoman would give me a comment for this article on Piker and Democrats’ future. I followed up repeatedly, only to be told that someone more senior would have to sign off. The comment never came.\n\nAs I watched Piker prepare for what was coming in January—an opening salvo from the new Trump administration that aims to redefine both the constitution and the country—I saw into a future most Democrats are too afraid to fully consider. And as I’ve watched how the weeks since have played out, it’s become clear how little time there is left to understand Piker’s provocative appeal to a new generation of voters. The cost of ignoring figures like him is becoming all too clear.\n\nHasan Piker loves America. Or at least he can remember a time when he did. He is the scion of a Turkish family of some renown. Piker’s father, Mehmet Behçet Piker, is one of the founding members of the country’s upstart center-right Future Party, and an uncle, Cenk Uygur, is a veteran pundit best known for his progressive media company the Young Turks. Piker himself was born in New Jersey but moved to Istanbul as a toddler. In his youth, he bristled at the chasteness of the country’s customs—struggling, in his words, with growing up “horny in a repressed culture”—and plotted a return to his once-and-future homeland.\n\nAt 18, he got his wish. Piker enrolled at the notoriously debauched University of Miami and chased his very own American dream. His education came second to intoxicating stateside indulgences: A few weeks into his college career, Piker started working as a nightclub promoter—one of his first jobs in the U.S.—hustling tourists into the strobing bacchanals of the city’s nightlife district.\n\n“Hasan knew exactly what was going on. He could get 100 to a club as a freshman,” Uygur told me. “Wherever he went, he instantly became the coolest person on campus.”\n\nLike so many other millennials, Piker experienced his first brush with left-wing politics via The Daily Show and other Bush-era satire, but he does not exactly remember himself as civically engaged. “I was a dumb college kid,” Piker said. “I was just happy to be in America.” He didn’t declare a major at Miami, but after transferring to Rutgers at his parents’ behest, Piker secured degrees in political science and communications in 2013. Nonetheless, Uygur remembers being “surprised” when his nephew inquired about a job at the Young Turks, a publication that had already become associated with a spiky, confrontational brand of populism a few shades outside the liberal mainstream. Uygur put Piker in ad sales, about as far removed from the partisan edges of the company as possible, and he hated the job. “You just have to sit there cold-calling and being nice to people,” Piker said. “It was a horrible experience.”\n\nIn 2016 Piker managed to secure dominion over the Young Turks’ Facebook page, which was technically a demotion from his position in the advertising department. (He took a pay cut.) He was tasked with cutting together the company’s TV broadcasts into bite-size, BuzzFeed-style clips designed to juice virality. Piker attended to those duties while simultaneously breaking ground on a rogue media brand of his own. He commandeered an empty supply closet in the Young Turks office and converted it into a makeshift studio. He hung up a green screen and, after determining that he didn’t yet have the broadcasting chops to rant on command, started writing scripts. The resulting videos melded perfectly with the Young Turks brand. Piker was scrappy, profane, horrified by Republicans, and annoyed at Democrats—auguring a burgeoning left–liberal schism that continues to color American politics today. Piker began surreptitiously interlacing those uploads with the rest of the company’s Facebook library. The first episode featured a noticeably stiff Piker standing in front of the camera, wearing a lavender shirt buttoned up to his collar. It was titled “5 Things You Didn’t Know About Bernie Sanders.”\n\nPiker called this series The Breakdown, and it became a surprise hit on Facebook, with some videos scoring more than 100 million views. The success was a testament to Piker’s content instincts. He was keyed in on a generational distaste for Hillary Clinton’s short-lived Democratic Party, and he also knew how to synthesize the various tendrils of social media during the shock of the initial Trump confusion. (One of his most frequent targets was Tomi Lahren, an early MAGA star who was drafting in a similar wave of engagement on the other end of the political spectrum.) The Breakdown embedded itself in the bones of the Facebook algorithm, and Piker leveraged the virality to promote his own Instagram, creating a raft of fans outside official Young Turks channels.\n\nThe first time Pike ever felt famous was at a Buffalo Exchange store, when he overheard two people talking about a particularly spicy episode of the show. “I was like, Oh my God,” he told me. “People are really watching this.”\n\nThe attention clarified something else about Piker. He was hot—classically handsome in a way that became fundamental to his mystique. Piker was a chubby kid in high school and continued to struggle with his weight through college, but after pledging himself to the gym in his early 20s, his body rewarded him. Piker shed 85 pounds. His shoulders thickened, his waist cinched up, and his striking visage conquered a certain corner of the liberal internet. BuzzFeed compiled a slideshow of Piker’s saucy Instagram selfies, bequeathing him the nickname Woke Bae. Piker pinned the article to the top of his Twitter page with pride. He seemed to inspire an endangered masculine fantasy in the fragile months of Trump’s first ascent: a hunky progressive, proclaiming the virtues of the “Women’s March,” standing against alpha-wave alt-right figures. One of the photos included in the BuzzFeed article featured Piker, with a doe-eyed model stare, dressed in a gray hoodie that reads, “I Met God, She’s Black.”\n\nThe glow-up provided him a blueprint for everything he’s achieved since. If Piker could become yoked, then anything was possible. “It was life-changing in the sense that it was a task I set for myself that I never was able to accomplish my whole life. It gave me so much confidence, not necessarily about how I look, but in my ability to overcome trials,” he said. “I’m not necessarily the most skilled person at anything. I don’t have a ton of natural talent. But I am super talented at working very hard.”\n\nPiker was already streaming on Twitch while he was working at the Young Turks, but in 2020, he left the company to pursue the venture full time. The breakup was amicable. “I didn’t try to talk him out of it,” Uygur said. “If I wasn’t sure he was going to be successful, I wouldn’t let him out on his own.”\n\nPiker regards his Twitch broadcasts as a natural extension of the work he did on Facebook. Online leftism, especially since Biden secured the Democratic nomination in 2020, has earned a reputation for being dour and nihilistic, eager to cheer on the pratfalls of the Democratic Party. But since his move four years ago, Piker has shown a willingness to be a team player. He has hosted voter registration drives with Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar, and when he filled out his 2024 ballot live on air, he reluctantly pulled the lever for Adam Schiff, whom he referred to as “Adam Shit,” owing to his staunch pro-Israel stance.\n\nFelix Biederman, a friend of Piker’s and one of the hosts of the notoriously ribald leftist podcast Chapo Trap House, compared his influence to something like the Daily Show’s cultural apex—which, tellingly, occurred when the Democratic Party was adrift following Bush’s defeat of Kerry in 2004. Is Piker a tad vulgar? Does he engage in some heterodox thinking? Sure, but as Biederman puts it, that presents “comparatively little risk to a pretty good reward.”\n\nPiker’s house is oddly quiet when he’s not streaming. He’s made the place into a palatial bachelor pad, all honoring his unique strain of bro-friendly progressivism. Bookcases pack Naruto manga next to revolutionary scholarship. An oil painting of Bernie Sanders, depicted as a leather-clad punk singer, gazes toward the mile-wide kitchen island. The refrigerator brims with protein shakes; Zyn canisters, in every flavor, are stacked in a pyramid. Most revealing of all might be the sticker plastered on the oven. It reads “I Love Being Mad on the Internet.”\n\nIn 2021 he purchased this house—the one that he and I are currently sitting in—for $2.7 million. It is undeniably lavish: Five bedrooms and five and a half bathrooms, with high ceilings, polished countertops, hardwood floors, and a stately patio on the bank of a lap pool. Piker has made no effort to conceal the good life while I’m around. I spot, on top of a pile of torn-open envelopes splayed out in the kitchen, a letter from Porsche. There’s a parts recall for his car.\n\nSome 50,000 people pay a monthly fee of $5 to subscribe to Piker’s Twitch channel, allowing them to tune into Piker’s stream ad-free. Extrapolate those numbers, as NBC did last September, and Piker is estimated to be raking in more than $2 million annually—a significant upgrade from the $65,000 a year he was making at his uncle’s company. He has taken full advantage of that sizable bounty, which has ruffled more than a few feathers on both sides of the aisle.\n\nConservative media loves to fetishize the material discrepancies of progressivism, so an avowed socialist buying up prime California real estate was manna from heaven. When news broke of Piker’s new abode, Fox News opined about the “hypocrisy” of a leftist living in upper-class luxury, while Ben Shapiro took Piker to task on YouTube. “$2.7 million is a lot of money. I don’t see you handing that out to all of the immiserated workers in the Marxist social construct,” he said. “You can get yourself a tiny little shack and live yourself the Henry David Thoreau lifestyle for probably $30,000 somewhere.”\n\nPiker wasn’t fazed. Months later, he posted a video of himself at a car dealership, purchasing that $200,000 Porsche. “Wait till they find out that I’m never going to fucking drive it!” he said, as a fresh wave of outraged MAGA acolytes filled his mentions. Does a socialist reveling in his abundance expose a political contradiction? Perhaps. But Piker has also correctly identified that in 2025, when Trump of the Manhattan penthouse can be twice enshrined as a working-class hero, those contradictions are not nearly as relevant as they used to be. Piker is a young man responding to his enormous windfall in a way that is extremely relatable to other young men. That, more than anything else, has proved to be invaluable to his cause.\n\n“Hasan lives a super aspirational life. A lot of other men on the left don’t have that same aspirational aesthetic to them,” Taylor Lorenz, an author and journalist who covers internet culture, told me. “There is a generation of young people who want to consume media from someone they look up to. They want to improve their lives. They want to imagine a better world for themselves. And a lot of people are selling that better future in a package that is hateful. I think that Hasan sells them on a progressive future.”\n\nPiker is happy to meet MAGA men where they are. “I give a lot of leeway to people for having somewhat bigoted views,” he said, without hesitation. It’s a radically different strategy from liberal orthodoxy that, for years, balked at the idea of courting people who were too retrograde, too brain-rotted by conspiracy, simply too far gone to be marbled into a larger political project. It recalls an incident in early 2020 when Sanders was excoriated for accepting the endorsement of Rogan, someone who, indeed, has shown that he’s held those “bigoted views” Piker speaks of. What did that liberal purity earn? Voters under 30 dramatically swung to the right in November’s election. Young men, in particular, have been conquered by the Republican Party—56 percent of them voted for Trump in 2024, compared with just 41 percent in 2020. Piker argues for a different approach.\n\nA few weeks before we met, Piker spent a day filming content with a fitness influencer named Bradley Martyn, who has 4.2 million followers on Instagram and who voted for Trump in November. Piker talked about housing justice and the vagaries of private healthcare on Martyn’s podcast. Then the two of them crushed 300-pound dead lifts at the gym.\n\n“I think that’s something a lot of political commentators lack in general,” Piker said. “They’re not real human beings. What I do requires a tremendous amount of charitability from the audience. I speak in opposition on a lot of issues that people take for granted. Issues that people have been socially conditioned to believe are the norm, and that the alternative is scary and dangerous. So people have to be open to hearing me out. It might make them more open-minded to my commentary and the way I see the world.”\n\nPiker has reason to believe this is working. On the r/Hasan_Piker subreddit, home to 151,000 “Marxist Chads,” there is a thread titled “How did you come across Hasan?” Some chime in to say they fell in love with his videos for the Young Turks or via a shoutout from AOC. But scores more accredit Piker for either their radicalization or their de-radicalization. An avowed centrist recalls being fearful of the “stigma of socialism” until he watched a video of a guy who was “young, sexy, and strong” debunking a right-wing talking point on systemic racism. They’ve swung left ever since. Another poster recalls going down a much darker path. They were watching Shapiro and Steven Crowder and found themselves sympathizing with white nationalist rhetoric. Over time, though, the poster began tuning into some of Piker’s nonpolitical videos. They found his personality charming, and it slowly drew them into the movement.\n\n“That lead me to where I am today where Im a democratic socialist,” they wrote. “Im glad I started watching him before I could vote.”\n\nWith the Democrats so thoroughly out of answers—the party’s approval ratings are hovering in the low 30s, after ceding so much digital ground to the conservative movement—Piker offers an alternative. The only question left is if the establishment can accept the type of coalition Piker wants to create.\n\nUygur, for one, has some doubts. “I know exactly how this movie is going to end,” he said. “There’s a zero percent chance Hasan is going to become a corporatist. And there’s a zero percent chance the Democratic Party as it’s currently composed will not be corporatist. So they will have an inconvenient marriage for a while, and then they’ll fall out of love with him. At the end of the day, he’s not going to give the message that they want.”\n\nSome signs suggest otherwise. At his house, Piker told me: “Virtually everyone running for head of the DNC has reached out to me, but I haven’t had time to interview them.” We were sitting in his studio while Kaya, his enormous Tibetan mastiff, weaved through our legs.\n\n“Well, except for Martin O’Malley, I think,” he said. “Or whichever one is the most corporate.” (Ken Martin eventually won the job.)\n\nBut he, too, had his doubts about how deep his influence can get in the current environment. “I’m not changing. That’s the thing. I’m not above admitting when politicians do good things, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to be a Democratic Party operative. That’s just not how I operate. Some people play catch-up with the Democratic Party and defend everything the Democrats do on principle, because they see that as a way to improve their social status. They’re just careerists. But I have a real political opinion, a real way I see the world. And I genuinely believe that it improves the living standards of everyday Americans. I think that’s not only good policy but also good politics.\n\n“If a day comes where I’m side by side with the Democratic Party,” Piker added, “that means the Democratic Party has changed its ways.”\n\nThis was the day before it would become clear just how badly Democrats were prepared for what was to come.\n\nLast year, Piker briefly considered quitting his streaming career. He thought about going back to school, earning a Ph.D., and never again worrying about the scrutiny on his life or his politics. Piker began to feel this way after Oct. 7, an event that forced him, and every other pundit, to witness every day the escalating horrors of the war between Israel and Hamas. Piker was a steadfast pro-Palestinian voice, and during the war, he demonstrated sympathy for some of Israel’s assailants.\n\nThis often put him in reedy territory. In one memorable instance, Piker interviewed an alleged Houthi sympathizer who went viral on TikTok for his uncanny resemblance to Timothée Chalamet. Piker asked him if he watched the long-running anime One Piece. The teenager nodded enthusiastically.\n\nThe incident helped catapult Piker to the forefront of the American anti-Zionist movement. Last November, the New York congressman and Israel hawk Ritchie Torres wrote an open letter, titled “Hasan Piker Is Dangerous,” addressed to Twitch CEO Dan Clancy. Torres called Piker the “poster child” of a surge in antisemitism since Oct. 7, contending that the streamer holds a deep-seated animus toward Jews. “Why is Twitch so untroubled by Hasan Piker’s troubling Jew-hatred?” he wrote. “If the KKK or the Third Reich were a social media platform, it would be Twitch.”\n\nPiker was used to the routine drama of internet fame, but censure from an elected official was a different beast. Fox News, in a story published after the letter, outlined a lengthy taxonomy of Piker’s takes on Gaza. Among them: that sexual violence that occurred on Oct. 7 didn’t change “the dynamic” of the conflict for him; that Hamas was a “lesser evil” than the Israeli military. Meanwhile, Jonathan Greenblatt, head of the Anti-Defamation League, took to X and claimed that Piker’s “toxic screeds against the Jewish state normalize bigotry and launder terror,” imploring media companies to deplatform him.\n\nThe controversy has started to affect Twitch’s bottom line. As Bloomberg reported in December, a smattering of online forums—all associated with the Zionist streamer and infamous internet troll Steven “Destiny” Bonnell, who has gotten into hot water for his usage of various slurs—have canvassed companies to suspend their ad campaigns with Twitch. So far, JP Morgan, AT&T, and Dunkin’ have acquiesced.\n\nSo, for the first time in his career, Piker is under siege. He maintains that the quotes circulated by Fox News were cherry-picked from the protracted monologues of his stream. As someone who has sampled the entirety of these broadcasts, which are all far too self-reflexive to ever be reduced to a single talking point, I think that assertion is largely true. Still, for as much as he told me it’s “not great” to be roped in with racists and Nazis by the Israel lobby, Piker does find himself wondering if all of this fracas might signal a greater shift. If his presence is being taken as a threat, then perhaps the right people are feeling the heat.\n\n“There’s no way Jonathan Greenblatt actually believes I’m an antisemitic person. I think I’m more dangerous,” said Piker, who, indeed, has called out anti-Jewish conspiracies on numerous occasions. “If your project is to constantly propagandize a pro-Israel position, someone like myself who is openly against antisemitism and works actively to educate people on dogwhistles and also happens to be anti-apartheid is more dangerous. Because I’m the one who’s going to be radicalizing their nieces and nephews, and that is what’s terrifying.” (Greenblatt has in fact only stepped up the antisemitism accusations in 2025.)\n\nSo, for now, this is all Piker wants to do. Asked if he has ever considered running for office—testing his influence against the nation as a whole—he demurred. He doesn’t think he’s cut out for the scrutiny of national politics, and he feels as if he is most useful to his cause in front of a PC.\n\nIn fact, Piker often speaks about his dream of becoming fully “regime-pilled.” If the Democratic Party did bend to his ideology, he’d happily morph into a cheerleading propaganda machine. Not a liberal Joe Rogan, but a leftist Joe Rogan. When I posed the same question to Biederman, he wasn’t so sure. Could he imagine a President Piker? “The only logical conclusion, when you acknowledge the immovability of the Democratic Party, is that there has to be a party that replaces it,” he said. “I don’t really see him ever wanting to do that, but I don’t know. Life will always surprise you.”\n\nIt’s a point that echoes something Piker said earlier about his unwillingness to compromise with the Democrats. Maybe, if his plan works, he won’t have to. A common refrain among leftists is that the liberal coalition, in its ossified state, can evolve only if it is sufficiently defeated. How does one purge its conservative elements? Or expunge its corporate donors? Or concoct a more progressive foreign policy? Through opposition, through primaries, through a categorical refusal to accommodate half measures. It is a conception that previously isolated someone like Piker to the political Arctic, disqualified from any real influence. But with the party in free fall—and a growing understanding that the old rules simply don’t work anymore—his dissidence has been given a rare moment to shine.\n\n“Do I think that there are people that have basically grown up watching me and then got into politics and started getting lower-level campaign positions? Absolutely,” he said. “Will they be chewed up and spit out by the machine or become the same feckless institutionalists later down the line when they actually do get some semblance of power? Possibly.\n\n“That’s the reason I want to grow my community,” he added. “So we can force the Democrats to do the right thing.”\n\nThe following morning is Jan. 20. The day has arrived. Piker returns to his desk in a button-down stitched with the Texas Lone Star to take in the dawn of the second Trump administration.\n\nPiker is in a sour mood. He grows steadily more agitated as the new president repeals LGBTQ+ protections and junks America’s participation in the Paris Agreement. He can hardly believe his eyes when Elon Musk makes a conspicuously Nazi-looking gesture toward a crowd of MAGA partisans. He watches Hulk Hogan rip off his blazer, revealing a shirt that reads “Trumpamania.” Piker waxes poetic on American decline, labor solidarity, and the wave of oligarchic Christian fascism that seems to be gobbling up every Western democracy.\n\n“America sucks. And as a nation that sucks, we’re going to have a president that sucks,” he growled, visibly more despondent than usual. “Democrats sold the country off. We’re an embarrassing country. And I think that even Trump supporters are somewhat aware of the demise.”\n\nIn the weeks that follow, once it becomes clear that a second Trump administration is poised to be just as destructive as advertised, Democrats are once again mired in a communications crisis. With Musk slashing the administrative state to ribbons, the specter of destabilizing tariffs, and a renewed assault on the rights of undocumented immigrants, where was the opposition? It was another stark reminder of just how overmatched the party appears to be, stricken by an enfeebling inability to summon the venom—the anger—its base is feeling.\n\nPiker has never missed an opportunity to express his wrath. The day after the inauguration, he flew to Japan with plans of waking up in the middle of the night to broadcast on Twitch during his usual West Coast time slot.\n\n“If you recognize that Republicans are devastating to the country, to the globe, to the lives of Americans and the lives of your neighbors, then you have to do everything in your power to fight back,” he said on a recent stream, his face softened by the milky lens of a webcam. Piker was analyzing Trump’s order to transform Guantánamo Bay into a detention camp for migrants, an action he believes is the first step toward far more heinous anti-immigration measures. It’s a classic Piker fixation, the sort of thing that innervates his fury for the inert center of the Democratic Party. To him, ceding any policy territory to the conservative elements of your coalition is death. It only provides cover for the Republicans to push further, to savor more cruelty, to inflict more pain.\n\n“This is why I kept criticizing the Democrats during the election cycle. This is why I kept losing my mind,” Piker said. “I was like, ‘Dude, I don’t want Trump to win, and it seems like you guys want him to win, or at least don’t care enough to do what is necessary to stop him from winning.’ And here we are.”\n\nThere are more days like this coming for Piker. More executive orders, more electoral defeats, more tepid reactions from the Democrats that he finds anemic or otherwise annoying. The terrible scale of this American era comes rushing at full blast through three computer monitors—on the other end is Piker, and 30,000 people who want to believe in a better future.\n\n“You have nobody to protect you but yourselves and your neighbors,” Piker said at the conclusion of that inauguration stream. “Who knows what will happen tomorrow, but I will be there to cover it. As always.”","summary":"Everyone searching for the \"liberal Joe Rogan\" might be missing something better altogether.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/02/hasan-piker-donald-trump-news-elon-musk-jd-vance.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/0bb25f34-806f-4c68-a9c5-a0de3d3fac62.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 10:40:00","author":"Luke Winkie","authors":["Luke Winkie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.305},{"id":291710386,"title":"Përse fjalimi i Kamala Harris u përqesh nga përdoruesit e rrjeteve sociale?","text":"Ish-zëvendëspresidentja Kamala Harris ka tërhequr vëmendjen pas një fjalimi që mbajti në shfaqjen e Broadway-it “A Wonderful World: The Louis Armstrong Musical.”\n\nAjo dhe bashkëshorti i saj, Doug Emhoff, vizituan dy shfaqje në Broadway, ku u përshëndetën nga publiku me duartrokitje dhe ovacione.

He held a variety of senior posts in the Obama administration and now teaches economics at Harvard. Furman was and is a true believer in neoliberalism—the idea that the job of government is to deregulate, privatize, globalize, and do some social welfare around the edges to moderate the casualties of liberated capitalism.\n\nIt was this ideology and constellation of policies that destroyed decent jobs in America’s factory economy. The extreme deregulation of finance led to the collapse of 2008 and the Great Recession that followed. And it was the Obama team’s inadequate response that led to a very slow recovery and paved the way for the disaffection that elected Donald Trump. Furman was at the center of all that.\n\nNow Furman has written an extended piece in Foreign Affairs magazine, attacking Biden’s recovery program as an overreach that brought us Trump II, and excoriating Biden for having abandoned neoliberalism. The piece is titled “The Post-Neoliberal Delusion and the Tragedy of Bidenomics.”\n\nThe piece is surprisingly churlish, and a textbook case of intellectual dishonesty. Furman is a master of misrepresentation and the use of cherry-picked data.\n\nFurman’s main complaint, to which he devotes more than half the piece, is that Biden’s several recovery programs overstimulated the economy, leading to inflation, which in turn soured voters on Biden’s re-election. He also disparages Biden’s industrial policy as having overpromised and underperformed.\n\nThe result, he writes, was dramatic price increases “on many Americans, which made it harder for them to pay for groceries, pay off credit cards, and buy homes. Not entirely unreasonably, they blamed that squarely on the Biden administration.” Explicitly blaming Trump on Biden, Furman adds that Biden’s “missteps reflected a broader unwillingness to contend with tradeoffs in economic policy and allowed Trump to ride a wave of discontent back into the White House.”\n\nFOR STARTERS, FURMAN IS SPLENDIDLY OBLIVIOUS to all the other factors that led to Trump’s return. They included Biden’s age and the increasing evidence that he was plainly unfit for a second term; the fact that Biden was a feeble spokesman for his own policies; that he had to be pressured into abdicating just four months before the election, leaving Kamala Harris as a weak candidate to run a weak campaign with mixed messages; not to mention the drag of Israel-Palestine. Even so, had 150,000 voters voted differently in three key states, Harris would be president.\n\nTo the extent that economic outcomes—in particular inflation—were responsible for the Democratic defeat, it was the same inflation that every major country experienced around the world, regardless of their responses to COVID, and it led to the uniform thrashing of political incumbents in every major country around the world, regardless of their political philosophy.\n\nFor Furman, none of this matters. It was all Bidenomics. Furman wraps his specific misrepresentations in a general broadside against Biden for having abandoned neoliberalism. And this is the article’s biggest whopper.\n\nIn chiding Biden for not doing more, Furman is splendidly oblivious to politics.\n\nFurman writes: “Since the 1990s, Democratic economic policy had largely been shaped by a technocratic approach, derided by its critics as “neoliberalism,” that included respect for markets, enthusiasm for trade liberalization and expanded social welfare protections, and an aversion to industrial policy.”\n\nIn fact, neoliberalism was far from technocratic. It was deeply political, often corrupt, and buried in Furman’s innocent-sounding “respect for markets” was a set of policies that demolished the safeguards dating back to FDR that protected workers and prevented a second great financial collapse until the crash of 2008.\n\nThe role of the several Biden stimulus programs in the economy’s rapid recovery from the COVID recession and the lingering inflation is complex and subject to fair debate. Jared Bernstein, who served as Biden’s chief economist, agrees that the program modestly contributed to inflation, but that other factors such as supply chain shocks contributed more; and that given the risks of deep recession, it was better to overstimulate than understimulate.\n\nBut Furman dismisses the impact of supply shocks on the COVID-induced inflation, and then whacks the Biden administration for paying insufficient attention to them. Furman writes: “Factors such as consumer tastes and supply chains determined where those price increases showed up in the economy, but they did not drive the overall average price increase.”\n\nThis is nonsense. As Bernstein has pointed out in rebuttal, “Unless a bunch of well-established economists, including Ben Bernanke and Olivier Blanchard, are all post-neoliberal delusionists, we’re in good company [in pointing to supply chain disruptions]. Their model also reflects the role of supply chain disruptions, as does work by Peter Orszag [OMB director under Obama], who wrote: ‘The central cause [of the inflationary spike] was the pandemic itself—and the nearly unprecedented supply-side shock it caused, which extended beyond the crisis itself.’”\n\nSpeaking at a panel at the American Economic Association, Furman even tried to sell the idea that supply disruptions were of little consequence to Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chair who is anything but a defender of over-stimulus. Bernanke was having none of it. Sectoral shortages drove most price increases, he pointed out.\n\nOne of the Biden administration’s first and most impressive reports, “Building Resilient Supply Chains,” which was commissioned during the 2020-2021 transition, was on reclaiming domestic sources of supply, precisely to prevent a recurrence of the sort of supply shock of the early days of the pandemic that led to both recession and shortage-driven inflation. So a prime goal of Biden’s industrial policy was not some sort of perverse economic nationalism in defiance of neoliberal verities; it was to ensure the security of supply chains.\n\nFurman also writes, preposterously, that “Biden was the first Democratic president in a century who did not permanently expand the social safety net.” Among other accomplishments, the Biden administration managed to put in place the largest increase in food stamps ever, as well as major improvements to Affordable Care Act exchanges, and child care requirements and incentives attached to industrial-policy subsidies. His increase in the Child Tax Credit cut child poverty nearly in half, but was limited to just one year because of the opposition of Republicans and faithless Democrats in a closely divided Senate.\n\nIn chiding Biden for not doing more, Furman is splendidly oblivious to politics. The hoariest economist joke concerns the economics professor and his student who are walking down the street, deep in thought, and the student, not watching where he is going, falls into a manhole. “What should I do?” asks the student. “Assume a ladder,” replies the professor.\n\nFurman, perfectly in character, assumes away Joe Manchin.\n\nHe writes toward the end of his piece that two of Biden’s priorities—expanding the Child Tax Credit and raising the minimum wage—were set back by inflation. Contradicting himself, he notes in passing that these goals were blocked by Republicans. That smells like a line added by an editor.\n\nTurning to Biden’s climate objectives, Furman, with characteristic political myopia, argues that a carbon tax would be more cost-effective than industrial policies. Maybe so, but has Furman heard of the oil industry? There have never been anything close to the votes for a carbon tax, least of all in a closely divided Congress.\n\nIN FAULTING BIDEN FOR OVERSTIMULATING the economy, Furman denies Biden credit for what he did well. At one point, he writes, “Inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and government debt were all higher in 2024 than they were in 2019. From 2019 to 2023, inflation-adjusted household income fell, and the poverty rate rose.”\n\nAs Noah Smith writes, taking Furman to task for playing cute with baseline years, “Comparing government debt in 2024 to 2019, and then blaming the rise on Biden, is more than a little unfair, because Donald Trump was President in 2020. More than 100% of the increase in debt actually happened under Trump. In fact, federal government debt actually fell as a percent of GDP between Biden’s inauguration and the third quarter of 2024.”\n\nSmith, something of a careful neoliberal himself, also observes, “As for the unemployment rate being higher in 2024 than 2019, this involves a bit of cherry-picking—in 2022 and early 2023, unemployment rates were as low or lower than they ever were before the pandemic.” For a well-documented technical rebuttal of Furman, see Smith’s Substack, which has its own better-nuanced criticisms of Biden.\n\nContrary to another bogus claim of Furman, thanks partly to Biden’s success in reaching full employment, worker bargaining power increased and real wages for nonmanagerial workers rose to above their pre-pandemic level.\n\nFurman also contends that Biden’s strategy of running the economy hot combined with targeted industrial policies did not create many jobs. He writes that “industrial policy has not led to better or cheaper microchips or any net job creation” and that “despite signing into law an infrastructure bill that committed over $500 billion to rebuilding everything from bridges to broadband, skyrocketing costs of construction have left the United States building less than it was before the law’s passage.”\n\nIn fact, according to official statistics of the Transportation Department, under Biden more than 1.7 million construction and manufacturing jobs and over 700,000 transportation sector jobs were created. Removing residential construction jobs from the total, that totals 1.3 million construction and manufacturing jobs. About 800,000 of these are manufacturing jobs. And the U.S. now has 400,000 more union workers than in 2021.\n\nMoreover, even Furman acknowledges the historic boom in manufacturing construction since the passage of the Biden agenda. Eventually, that construction will be completed, the factories will open, and workers will assume their jobs.\n\nAt one point, Furman writes, as if sleepwalking through his own responsibility, that Biden’s stimulus program was “an overcorrection of the Obama administration’s insufficient stimulus package in the wake of the global financial crisis in 2008, which contributed to the United States’ painfully slow recovery.” He got the Obama failure right. Furman was at the center of those Obama policies!\n\nNONE OF THIS CRITIQUE OF FURMAN is meant as a blanket defense of Joe Biden. He appointed some great people and revived antitrust. He defined a sensible form of economic nationalism and allied himself with a resurgence of trade unionism. However, he appointed some regulatory officials who were too close to industry, and his reappointment of Jay Powell to chair the Fed was one of his greatest blunders. Biden also stayed too long at the fair.\n\nBut his programs of economic stimulus and industrial policy, if imperfect, were directionally sound and a long-overdue break with the neoliberal past.\n\nWhat, finally, is Furman up to? At 54, he may feel he still has another shot at a senior economic post in some future Democratic administration. If so, this is his own delusion.\n\nWhile Democrats are at odds with each other on everything from DEI to whether to make some tactical alliances with Trump, I know of no Democratic faction that pines for the good old days of neoliberalism when Democrats joined with Republicans to cut managed capitalism loose from its moorings and wreck the life chances of working families.","summary":"What’s behind his broadside against Joe Biden’s economics?","url":"https://prospect.org/economy/2025-02-18-intellectual-dishonesty-jason-furman/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22507/download/Kuttner-Furman%20article%20021825.jpg?cb=5907f43bfb0ceea4951e03cd7b4541f8&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 10:15:00","author":"Robert Kuttner","authors":["Robert Kuttner"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":291737296,"title":"Boston man who oversaw VA information security swept up in DOGE cuts: ‘Veteran privacy at risk’","text":"A Boston man who oversaw information security for the federal Veterans Affairs website says he has been fired as the Trump administration ramps up its efforts to downsize the federal workforce.\n\nMIT graduate Jonathan Kamens, “deployed” to the VA as an information security lead through the former US Digital Service, is speaking out after he learned Friday night that he and dozens of his colleagues had been laid off, calling President Trump and Elon Musk’s actions “illegal.”\n\n“The country is in a bit of chaos right now, the job market is a little rough right now, but I am not worried about where I will land,” Kamens told the Herald Monday. “I am much more worried about where this country is going to land if we don’t push back against what’s going on.”\n\n“The people who work for the federal government are dedicated and are concerned about the future of this country,” he added. “Every single one of them who gets fired without due process, without cause, is a loss to the nation, and it damages the government’s ability to provide the services that the American people need.”\n\nRoughly 160 employees who had worked for the Digital Service remained on the job when Trump renamed the agency on his first day back in office last month to the Department of Government Efficiency, a Musk-led special commission tasked with slashing federal spending.\n\nKamens said he landed his remote role for the Digital Service in June 2023 after working for more than 30 years in the private sector, mostly at startups in the Boston area. President Barack Obama launched the agency in 2014 to fix glitches plaguing HealthCare.gov and modernize the government’s approach to technology.\n\nRoughly 50 USDS staffers received termination letters Friday from the DOGE SERVICE that cited Trump’s executive order establishing the agency.\n\n“Due to the restructuring and changes to USDS’s mission, USDS no longer has need for your services,” one letter said, according to a copy shared with Bloomberg.\n\nThe dismissals are part of a wave of thousands of terminations across a slew of federal agencies. Many of those receiving termination notices across the government are probationary employees, who have worked for the government for less than a year.\n\nUSDS had four-year term limits, differing from the probationary statuses seen in other agencies.\n\nIn a LinkedIn post on Saturday about his situation, Kamens, who publicly endorsed Kamala Harris for president ahead of last November’s Election, said he was “fairly certain” he was “illegally fired due to political considerations, i.e., disloyalty to the administration.”\n\nKamens declined to expand further when asked by the Herald what he meant. In a LinkedIn post ahead of the Inauguration, he stated he would “probably need to step away” as the “the substantial uncertainty and chaos surrounding the impending transition to the next presidential administration exceed my family’s risk tolerance threshold.”\n\nKamens said he was deployed to the VA to “level up” its “cybersecurity practices” to combat evolving cyber threats. In the role, he was “in charge of information security for VA.gov, which has millions of users per month and stores and processes huge amounts of veterans’ personal information.”\n\n“I’ve been told by people I’ve worked with that I’m the best at what I do of anyone they’ve ever met,” he wrote in the post Saturday, which has been seen by hundreds of thousands of platform users. “Now there will be no strong information security leadership for VA.gov, putting veteran privacy at risk. Does this seem like improving government efficiency?”\n\nKamens said he declined a buyout offer that offered eight months of pay and benefits because he didn’t want to leave government service. Roughly 75,000 employees – less than 4% of the federal workforce – accepted the package.\n\nAfter securing a court ruling upholding its authority late last week, the Trump administration initiated mass layoffs across scores of federal agencies – a strategy that the president and Elon Musk say aims to make the government more efficient.\n\nTrump, in an executive order before the court ruling, told agency leaders to plan for “large-scale reductions.” The Office of Personnel Management, the federal government’s human resources department, has given agencies until 8 p.m. Tuesday to issue layoff notices.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Energy, the Department of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the US Forest Services are just some of the agencies that have layoff efforts in full force.\n\nThe VA also announced last week it had “dismissed” more than 1,000 employees who had either served less than a year in a “competitive service appointment” or less than two years in an “excepted service appointment.”\n\nNewly appointed VA officials have projected that the layoffs will save the department “more than $98 million per year.” They’ve also highlighted how “all of those resources” will be “redirected back toward health care, benefits and services for VA beneficiaries.”\n\nMore than 43,000 probationary employees in mission-critical roles received exemptions from the dismissals, the VA has said. “This was a tough decision, but ultimately it’s the right call to better support the Veterans, families, caregivers, and survivors the department exists to serve,” Secretary Doug Collins said in a statement.\n\n“The firings that DOGE is doing throughout the government, I don’t think they’re making the government more efficient which Musk claims he’s trying to accomplish,” Kamens told the Herald. “What I think they are doing is tearing apart the government’s ability to serve the American people.”\n\nMassachusetts’ Congressional delegation has been a vocal critic of Trump and Musk’s authority to cut federal agencies and conduct mass layoffs. Attorney General Andrea Campbell and 13 of her counterparts filed a federal lawsuit last week and argued DOGE’s actions should be taken by a “nominated and Senate-confirmed officer.”\n\n“It’s risky for me to be speaking out,” Kamens said Monday, “but I think we have to do it. It’s the best and the only way we’re going to recover some level of what we’re losing, to protect the government and what the government does to serve the American people from the damage that’s being done to it.”\n\nHerald wire services contributed to this report","summary":"“The people who work for the federal government are dedicated and are concerned about the future of this country...”","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/02/18/boston-man-who-oversaw-va-information-security-swept-up-in-doge-cuts-veteran-privacy-at-risk/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/AP25045542937867.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 10:02:30","author":"Lance Reynolds","authors":["Lance Reynolds"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":291737304,"title":"Murphy: Kennedy brings much needed change","text":"Joke all you want about Bobby Kennedy, the guy is plenty capable of serving as Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nHe’s a brilliant lawyer and a more savvy litigator than 90% of attorneys in this country. He’s taken on many major corporations in class action lawsuits, and won, so he knows a thing or two about playing chess with the big boys.\n\nEven people who hate Donald Trump voted for him because he teamed up with Kennedy, who promised to shake things up. We’ll see what happens ,but there was zero chance a Kamala Harris administration was going to change a thing. The outsider with a raspy voice and big brain is a breath of fresh air no matter how many stories come out about dead bears and brain worms.\n\nThe American people are desperate for sincerity in our leaders, and Kennedy comes across as sincere. Whether he walks the walk remains to be seen, but nobody else in DC even comes close.\n\nWe all know that corporations, not people, are in charge. We also know that corporations will do very bad things for profit. So, when Kennedy says that companies add dangerous chemicals to food to increase profits, we believe him. And when nobody in DC does anything to help, we look elsewhere for leadership.\n\nWe didn’t vote for “anyone but Trump” or “anyone but Biden,” we voted for “anyone who isn’t part of the DC machine.” Bobby Kennedy fits the bill.\n\nKennedy isn’t new to public health. He became interested decades ago when he began cleaning up our rivers and getting mercury out of fish. Mothers of babies who got sick after being vaccinated with shots containing mercury read about Kennedy’s work and begged him to help. Kennedy saw the connection and got involved in the fight for vaccine safety. Nobody paid much attention, until he decided to run for president. Then he became a “nutty anti-vaxxer”. It was an odd turn of events for a guy who was getting awards for getting mercury out of fish. If mercury is unsafe in a six-pound fish, then it’s unsafe in a six-pound baby.\n\nCountless studies show that heavy metals, like lead and mercury, are unsafe at any levels in the human body. Even the inserts inside vaccines warn parents that vaccines have more than fifty side effects, such as encephalitis and death. Kennedy wants to make vaccines safer, and do more research to determine why they have so many side effects. That does not make him a nut.\n\nIf the only thing Kennedy does over the next four years is figure out why some people are more vulnerable to vaccine problems than others, then his time will have been well spent. Nobody thinks all vaccines are always dangerous for all people, but many believe that some vaccines are sometimes dangerous for some people. This is why the federal government set up a vaccine injury compensation fund. Kennedy wants to find out who the vulnerable people are, because the only other option is to let people get sick and die.\n\nKennedy is hardly the first one to sound the alarm about vaccines. When my dad was born, his doctor told my grandmother never to let him be vaccinated because he had a skin condition and had been exposed to tuberculosis. When he went to school in the 1940s and 50s, he always brought a doctor’s note explaining that he was not to be vaccinated. Nobody called my grandmother names or said the doctor was an anti-vaxxer.\n\nYears later when Dad joined the military, he was in line for a health screening when the doctor asked why he wasn’t vaccinated. Dad explained but the doctor didn’t care. He jabbed him with a bunch of vaccines and in short order, Dad was unable to wear the wool uniforms or participate in many activities. He was devastated when they told him he had to be honorably discharged because of what the vaccines had done to his health.\n\nKennedy has his eye on two things: the health of the American people and the corruption in DC that has deprived the American people of good health.

Common Cause planned to pay for the ads in collaboration with the Southern Poverty Law Centre Action Fund.\n“We believe this is limiting our freedom of expression at a critical time in our nation’s history. This seems to show The Washington Post is feeling pressure to cover the news a certain way,” Kase Solomón and Huang said.\nThe Post declined to comment on its internal decisions about advertising campaigns. Its advertising guidelines state that the Post “accepts all types of advertising and does not decline advertising unless there is a compelling reason to do so,” but “nonetheless reserves the right to position, revise, or refuse to publish any advertisement.”\nThe ads are part of a larger campaign by Common Cause called “Fire Elon Musk,” urging people to sign a petition calling for Musk’s removal as the head of DOGE. The group says it’s collected 60,000 signatures and organised thousands of calls to congressional representatives.\nMusk, the world’s richest person, runs several companies including X, SpaceX, The Boring Company, and Tesla. He is now leading DOGE, the new commission that aims to slash US federal spending and cut regulations.\n\nThe Post’s decision to pull the ad comes just a month after Elon Musk nodded at a friendship with the outlet’s billionaire owner, Jeff Bezos, in a series of X posts. Musk and Bezos own competing companies, SpaceX and Blue Origin, respectively, and have exchanged playful jabs for years.\nIn January posts, Musk and Bezos congratulated each other on their companies’ rocket launches, and Musk posted clips from the 2008 comedy Step Brothers, one of which showed its characters asking, “Did we just become best friends?”\nLate last year, the paper said it would not endorse a candidate for US president and would avoid doing so in the future – a decision immediately condemned by a former executive editor and one that the publisher insisted was “consistent with the values the Post has always stood for”.\nIn an article posted on the front of its website, The Washington Post – reporting on its own inner workings – also quoted anonymous sources within the publication that said an endorsement of Kamala Harris over Donald Trump had been written but not published.\nThose sources told the paper’s reporters that the company’s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, made the decision.\nAdditional reporting by Associated Press\nThis article was first published by Business Insider","summary":"The Post’s decision, made without explanation, has raised concerns about censorship and potential pressure to cover news in a specific way.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3299171/bezos-washington-post-scraps-ad-calling-trump-fire-elon-musk-print-editions","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/02/18/d1ee1e93-f131-41eb-881f-1ea6072cb8b7_631a28e3.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 09:47:07","author":"Business Insider","authors":["Business Insider"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":291802874,"title":"Elon Musk: Democrats Use Taxpayer Funds to Encourage Illegal Migration","text":"Democrats use taxpayer funds to attract millions of illegal immigrants, says Elon Musk, leader of the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n“The REAL reason so many Democrats are upset about entitlements (social security, medical, etc) fraud investigations is that they are using your taxpayer money as handouts to attract and retain ILLEGAL immigrants. Their future voters. ” Musk tweeted on Feb 17, amid rising Democratic denunciation of his investigations into government waste and waste.\n\n“That’s what it’s all about,” he said, adding “Truth.”\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, Democrats spent at least $30 billion to import roughly nine million migrants, mostly via the southern border.\n\nThat inflow of nine million southern migrants was in addition to the legal inflow of about 1 million migrants per year, plus the inflow of about 1 million blue-collar and white-collar contract workers, via a complex variety of half-hidden visa programs such as the H-1B, J-1, TN, H-2B, and H-2A programs.\n\nMeanwhile, Americans’ birth rates are dropping as more young people scramble to find decent jobs, spouses, and housing, aid Biden’s massive inflow of migrants. In 2024, Americans gave birth to roughly 3.5 million children, as illegal migrants birth to another 400,000 kids who automatically gained U.S. citizenship.\n\nThe pro-migration spending under Biden included $22.6 billion distributed to a wide variety of Democrat-aligned non-profit groups via the Department of Health and Human Services. The funding was unveiled by a group called OpenTheBooks. Much additional funding was distributed via Biden’s pro-migration Department of Homeland Security and his pro-globalism Department of State.\n\nThat inflow is adding more government-dependant, Democratic-voting immigrants to the nation’s voting rolls.\n\nThe Washington Post, the New York Times, the Atlantic, Axios, the Los Angeles Times, and the Wall Street Journal have all admitted that rapid demographic shifts spurred by mass immigration are tilting the nation toward a permanent Democrat political majority.\n\nRELATED — White House Press Secretary Brings the Receipts of Waste Cut by DOGE\n\nThe 2024 election defeat was especially shocking to Democrats because many migrant communities voted for President Donald Trump’s economic policies, which include his curbs on the inflow of wage-cutting migrant workers.\n\nYet Democrats deny they are using the government funding to change the nation’s demographics and politics, even as they freely admit to favoring more migration. “The notion … that we intend to allow illegal immigration is nothing short of preposterous,” Biden’s border chief Alejandro Mayorkas told a Senate hearing in 2024.\n\nInstead, Democrats justify their pro-migration policies with a variety of claims.\n\nMayorkas repeatedly said he favored “equity” between foreign migrants and Americans. His border policy is “all about achieving equity, which is really the core founding principle of our country.”\n\nThe ideological support for migration is often surrounded by contempt for ordinary Americans. For example, pro-migrati0n policies allow the Democrats’ college-graduate progressives to feel good when sneering at the vast majority of ordinary Americans who rely on borders to help govern their own country.\n\n“I’m all for just like, open the f… border,” Ohio activist Kevin Oyakawa allegedly told a journalist in October 2024, adding:\n\nI don’t give a shit about who comes in here — we don’t need Border Patrol. But the issue with even talking about immigration here in Ohio is that it’s a losing issue for Democrats here for no fucking reason other than people’s pure racism.\n\nThe ideological support for more migration is obligatory among Democrats, says Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. “De facto open[-borders] immigration is a litmus test issue now on the left,” he told Breitbart News.\n\nDemocrats also claim migration is good for the economy — even though it reduces ordinary Americans’ wages and productivity.\n\nIn 2022, for example, Mayorkas said:\n\nWe look to our partner to the north that has a much more nimble immigration system that can be retooled to the needs at the moment. For example, Canada is in need of 1 million workers and they have agreed that in 2023, they will admit 1.4 million … immigrants to fill that labor need that Canadians themselves cannot. We are stuck in antiquated laws that do not meet our current [business] needs. And they haven’t been working for many, many years.\n\n“Now, more than ever, we’re short of workers,” Senl Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said at a Hill press conference in 2022, adding:\n\nWe have a population that is not reproducing on its own with the same level that it used to. The only way we’re going to have a great future in America is if we welcome and embrace immigrants, the dreamers and all of them — because our ultimate goal is to help the Dreamers [illegals who were brought in by their parents] get a path to citizenship for all 11 million — or however many undocumented there are here [emphasis added].\n\nThe inflow of migrants is good for major investors and Wall Street because it inflates the stock market by reducing wages, raising rents, boosting consumer sales, and reducing pressure on companies to invest in high-tech workplace machinery.\n\nBut migration is also good for the government. For example, Democratic-aligned bureaucrats in government also profit from the inflow of poor migrants who need welfare and economic support. Similarly, the arrival of new groups of foreign children ensures that Democratic-run schools and their unions can hire additional teachers, translators, and aid workers.\n\nRELATED — “Eat Elon Musk” Sign Displayed as Democrats Freak Out over DOGE Cutting Waste, Fraud\n\nUnsurprisingly, many Democrats — including President candidate Kamala Harris — have repeatedly favored the inflow of more migrants over policies that would help ordinary Americans earn good wages, get married, buy homes, and rear families.\n\nMusk’s own views on migration are complicated but closely match his economic and political self-interests.\n\nMusk favors the continued inflow of lower-wage, mixed-skill H-1B contract workers from India and China, partly because he used them to replace thousands of better-paid Americans at his Tesla factory.\n\nHe also uses hard-working H-1B migrants at his X social media company, where nearly all of them work long hours — with little complaint — in the hope of getting paid with U.S. citizenship from the federal government.\n\nMusk also wants more births because babies become active adventurous adults — but also because they become consumers, and eventually, users of X, Starlink, and Tesla autos. “Honestly, there’s really no time like the present — just have kids,” he told reporters at a Trump rally in 2024. “You won’t be sorry. It’ll work out.”\n\nBut Mayorkas is also against the mass migration of lower-skilled workers into the United States.\n\nIn part, that 2024 opposition to unskilled migration is likely part of his political alignment with Trump — and to Musk’s personal preference for a high-tech, high-trust, semi-libertarian society.\n\nHowever, Musk has not been asked by reporters how his support for more salary-slicing H-1B workers is consistent with his call for skilled Americans to have more children.","summary":"Democrats are using taxpayers' funds to attract millions of illegal immigrants, says Elon Musk,  leader of the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n\nThe post Elon Musk: Democrats Use Taxpayer Funds to Encourage Illegal Migration appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2025/02/18/elon-musk-democrats-use-the-federal-budget-to-encourage-illegal-migration/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/02/elon-musk-DOGE-1-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-18 08:55:03","author":"Neil Munro","authors":["Neil Munro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.087},{"id":291661040,"title":"Famous birthdays for Feb. 18: Dr. Dre, Cybill Shepherd","text":"1 of 2 | Dr. Dre participates in the Pepsi Super Bowl LVI Halftime Show press conference in Los Angeles on February 10, 2022.
