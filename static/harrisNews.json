Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy CAROLINA PIRAS FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:00:50 BST, 19 April 2025 |Updated:00:54 BST, 19 April 2025 \n\nDenise Van Outen is reportedly dating a new man 'in secret' and he is said to have joined her for a romantic holiday to the Maldives.\nThe DJ and TV star, 50, has allegedly enjoyed a 'string of dates' with a businessman called Adam Butler after her split from her ex Jimmy Barba.\nHe is said to have joined her in the Maldives while on a work trip after they were spotted on a date at Akira Black in London, according to The Sun.\nA friend told the publication: 'Denise loved being single and has been so busy with her TV work and DJ-ing but Adam is someone she's enjoyed spending time with.\n'They went public last month on a date at Akira Black in the Mandarin Oriental in London.\n'She is in a great place in her life, her career is soaring and Adam is a successful businessman, so they compliment each other so well.'\n\nDenise Van Outen, 50, is reportedly 'dating a hunky new man in secret' as the pair enjoyed a romantic holiday to the Maldives (she is pictured on holiday)\nThe source also claimed that Denise's friends were 'thrilled she has found someone like Adam' as he 'treats her like a queen'.\nMailOnline have contacted Denise's representatives for comment.\nThe reports of her blossoming romance come after Denise opened up about her dating struggles following her split from Jimmy.\nShe has been single since splitting from Jimmy Barba in October 2023 and joined exclusive dating app Raya last year in the hopes of finding love again.\nBut she admitted that she relies on dating apps to meet men as finding potential suitors has become harder since moving to the countryside.\nThe presenter has been single since splitting from Jimmy Barba in October 2023 and joined exclusive dating app Raya last year in the hopes of finding love again.\nAnd in a new interview, she admitted that without dating app Raya, she wouldn't have much of a love life as meeting guys 'in real life' is not as easy while living in rural Kent.\nShe told The Sun: 'Actually, for me, dating apps are a really good thing. I don't know how else I would meet people if I wasn't doing that.'\n\nThe DJ and TV star is thought to have enjoyed ' a string of dates with Adam Butler' before the businessman joined her in the tropical location while on a work trip\n'When I was younger, there was the option to go out, but now I live in the country, it's not like I'm able to just go to the pub,' she added. \n'Even if I went to my local, they're all my neighbours who I know anyway, so that's of no value to me.'\nDetailing how her only chance of meeting potential matches 'in real life' is online, she hinted that she has come across some celebrity suitors on exclusive dating app Raya.\n'I'm still on my Raya dating app, I've gone on quite a few dates with different people, I've seen so many celebrities [on Raya], but you aren't allowed to say who is on there,' she teased.\nThe former Big Breakfast host noted that while it's 'really fun' to use the app, she has awkwardly often found herself paired with one of her mates.\nShe said she hasn't really been active on Raya over the winter months, but with summer fast approaching, she plans to change that, quipping: 'Watch this space.'\nThe performer said being a single mother to her daughter Betsy, 14 - who she shares with ex-husband Lee Mead - makes it harder to meet new people as she can't go out at night.\nEven when she is out DJing, Denise said she is 'in and out' of the venue and 'doesn't hang around', lessening her chance of sparking up a romance with anyone there.\nShe is seemingly keen to get back into the dating pool again after revealing she wasn't 'fussed' about being in a relationship last year.\n\nThe presenter has been single since splitting from Jimmy Barba (pictured) in October 2023 and joined exclusive dating app Raya last year in the hopes of finding love again \n\n Denise Van Outen, 50, says she's reliant on dating apps to meet men \nWhile she has been on a few dates, she said she wasn't putting pressure on herself to find a new partner because she's very content with her own company these days.\nReferencing the end of her engagement to Eddie Boxshall, who she split from in January 2022 after discovering he had been unfaithful, she told Fabulous magazine: 'I'm not fussed either way now.\n'I'm really good friends with Tamzin Outhwaite and we were saying: ''Isn't it nice to actually just be loving life and not feel pressured to have to be in a relationship or be with someone?'' I've learned to be on my own and be content.\n'This industry can feel pressurised, and then when things go wrong, it's so public. You worry that people see you as a failure.\n'I wonder if people say: ''Why can't she hold down a relationship? History keeps repeating itself'', but I'm not chasing it now.'\nShe added that her relationship with Eddie only got cut short because of what she discovered he had done, admitting that was the 'sad part' of the break-up.\nDenise said she was 'back to square one' but was trying to keep a 'positive outlook' and 'have an open heart'.\nAfter her devastating split from Eddie, Denise found love again with Jimmy Barba in July 2022, but they split after 18 months together.\n\nShe ended her engagement to Eddie Boxshall (seen together) in January 2022 after discovering he had been unfaithful\nDenise went public with property developer Jimmy, 55, that summer after her split from her love rat ex Eddie, who she was with for seven years.\nShe ended her relationship with the commodities trader in January 2022 after discovering unfaithful messages.\nEddie moved out of Denise's home following their shock split and was thought to be staying with friends.\nSix months later, she went public with Jimmy, who she met through All Saints singer Shaznay Lewis, at the Grand Prix Ball and the pair enjoyed their first holiday together after jetting to Marbella.\n\nA look back at Denise Van Outen's love life\n\nJay Kay (1998-2001) \nDenise, who narrates The Only Way Is Essex, dated Jamiroquai lead singer Jay Kay, 52, for three years from 1998 to 2001. \nThe TV personality, 47, enjoyed a highly-publicised relationship with the Jamiroquai bandmember, 52, before they 'painfully' called it quits back in 2001.\nDenise even wrote about him in her new autobiography A Bit Of Me, and he claimed they called off their plans to marry due to 'conflicting' jobs at the time.\n\nThe ex files: The star, who narrates The Only Way Is Essex, dated Jamiroquai lead singer Jay Kay, 52, for three years from 1998 to 2001 (pictured in 1998)\nNick Moran (2001)\nAfter Jay, there was a brief rebound fling with Lock, Stock And Two Smoking Barrels actor Nick Moran. \nOne onlooker observed of one of their date nights: 'They were like a pair of magnets - stuck together all night.

We are seeing those that are capitulating to clearly unconstitutional threats.” She understands the American experiment stands on a precipice, and that some law firms courting favor with Donald Trump are complicit.\n\nThey are engaging in genuinely risky business that echoes the complicity of Germans who enabled Hitler’s rise — not through ideology, but by normalizing and legitimizing his power. We are watching, in real time, the methodical dismantling of democracy and the ascent of autocracy.\n\nDemocracy does not die with a bang. But complicity erodes it norm by norm, step by step, with elites greasing the slippery slope. They need to remember that history will judge their courage.\n\nWalnut Creek\n\nMeasure T will keep\nschools, cities strong\n\nWe, the mayors of Lafayette, Moraga, Orinda and Walnut Creek, urge you to vote yes on Measure T for the excellent high schools serving our communities. The need for the additional funding is compelling.\n\nStrong local schools are the foundation of our cities. Many of us moved here so our children could attend our excellent schools, and we continue to benefit from the strong property values our outstanding local schools support.\n\nMeasure T will provide locally controlled funding to retain excellent teachers, maintain manageable class sizes and preserve high-quality programs, keeping our schools among the best.\n\nEvery dollar from Measure T will stay local. Independent oversight and annual audits ensure funds are spent as promised. Seniors can apply for an exemption.\n\nJoin us in voting yes on Measure T to help our students succeed.\n\nSusan Candell, Lafayette\nSteve Woehleke, Moraga\nLatika Malkani, Orinda\nand Cindy Darling, Walnut Creek\n\nFailed health agencies\nmust be overhauled\n\nRe: “If autism is public health crisis, why is the HHS pulling back?” (Page A6, April 17).\n\nLet’s state some facts: Autism diagnoses increased 175% from 2014 to 2024. Cancer in people under 50 increased 79% globally since 1990. Over 40% of adults are obese and about 75% are overweight. Childhood obesity has tripled since 1970. Diabetes increased four times since 1990. Alzheimer’s disease deaths have increased by 140% since 2000. Life expectancy in the U.S. is 12th among developed countries. Additives are in our foods that are not allowed in most other developed countries.\n\nI don’t see how anyone can believe that the NIH, CDC or FDA have done a good job. It is time to get rid of people who have failed to improve our health. I firmly support a complete overhaul of these agencies and a new focus on the prevention of illness.\n\nImmunizations are\na shared responsibility\n\nWorld Immunization Week, observed from April 24–30, reminds us of the vital role vaccines play in protecting lives across all ages. As communities worldwide recover from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s more important than ever to rebuild trust in vaccines and close the immunization gap.\n\nVaccines have eradicated smallpox, brought polio to the brink of extinction and continued to prevent countless illnesses. Yet millions still lack access due to misinformation, poverty and health care barriers.\n\nLet’s use this week to raise awareness, support outreach programs and advocate for equitable access to vaccines for everyone, everywhere. Immunization isn’t just a personal choice — it’s a shared responsibility.\n\nMike Crosby\n\nDemocrats jump the gun\nto condemn Trump tariffs\n\nRe: “Trump’s tariffs target of state suit” (Page A1, April 17).\n\nThe tariffs have not even been fully established yet, and Gov. Gavin Newsom, the media and the rest of the Democrat cabal are crying about them. It took them four years to figure out that Joe Biden was a cognitive disaster, but in less than a month, they have definitely concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that the tariffs are bad.\n\nOf course, we know that it is just because they are “Trump” tariffs that make them “bad.” They would whine about a cure for cancer if it was discovered by Donald Trump.\n\nNewsom signed bills authorizing $50 million to fight Trump policies here in California, whether they are good for the state or not. This is just another example of how Democrats waste California taxpayer dollars and neglect its citizens — just another reason to vote Republican.\n\nJay Todesco","summary":"Also: Measure T &#124; Agency overhaul &#124; Shared responsibility &#124; Jumping the gun.

Laverne Cox, the first transgender person to be nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in an acting category, starred as the show’s main protagonist with legendary comedian George Wallace as her estranged father.\n\nThe cancellation comes only months after Bezos erased statements pledging “equity for Black people,” “LGBTQ+ rights,” and any mention of “transgender” from Amazon’s website in December, reported The Washington Post, also owned by Bezos. Amazon was also one of the biggest corporations to overhaul its website following President Donald Trump’s war on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI).\n\nCox, Wallace, and co-creator Dan Ewen broke the news that a Clean Slate wasn’t returning for another season in a guest column for Deadline.\n\n“By the end of March, our eight-episode series, our labor of love, was canceled,” the column begins. “A seven-year effort was gone in a puff of sever exhaust.” \n\nIt continues: “Please forgive the word count. This s--- was cheaper than therapy.” \n\nClean Slate was backed by the legendary late screenwriter and producer Norman Lear, who died of cardiac arrest in late 2023. The show was reportedly his last completed project. \n\nIn making the show—which centered on bridging familial and political divides, with Alabama as its backdrop—the actors shared that its script often transcended their own life experiences.\n\n“Laverne, one of precious few Alabamans to appear on both the cover of Time magazine and British Vogue, had spent the prior 90 minutes entertaining dozens of questions about transness from the ever-curious Norman,“ the article noted, springing back to the days before the cancellation. ”It was a fantastic conversation, and we would wager it was Norman’s first meeting where he would find himself addressed as ‘guuuurl’ 17 times. \n\nThe article also lauded Lear for being able to empathize with experiences different than his own, despite his awesome age. (He was 101 when he died.)\n\n“Some of Lear’s questions were too personal, some overly medical,” wrote Cox, Wallace and Ewen in Deadline. “Laverne’s retort, ‘That information is between me and my doctor and my boyfriend,’ would end up in the pilot script. But Norman’s questions were evidence of a mind that had remained open, decades after most people’s have welded shut and whatnot.”\n\nThe article also reminisces on the moment the series was introduced to the world: “It was a fight, but our joyful, aspirational comedy about a trans Black woman returning to South as her true self had gone from just an inkling to a billboard in Midtown,” they wrote. \n\nBut it too soon it disappeared, the the show’s stars writing that they “mourn the characters being scrubbed from storytelling out of fear.” \n\nThey added, “We will push to keep the story alive, for the sake of the kind of people portrayed in it, the kind of people being legislated out of existence, or erased from history books.”\n\nBefore late December, Amazon had a webpage that said it was “working at the U.S. federal and state level on legislation” to protect transgender people. It also noted that the company provided “gender transition benefits based on the Standards of Care published by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH).” The section with those claims was completely scrapped, though a company spokesperson maintained at the time that the benefit was still available, according to WaPo.\n\nAmazon also changed its “Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion” page to “Inclusive Experiences and Technology” and cut an entire section saying that the company stood “in solidarity” with Black employees and customers. \n\nAfter killing a WaPo op-ed endorsing Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election, Bezos also reportedly ordered the paper to rewire its opinion page to solely focus on “personal liberties and free markets.”","summary":"Paras Griffin / Getty ImagesAmazon Prime Video, owned by multibillionaire Jeff Bezos, has canceled Clean Slate, one of the few streaming series led by a trans woman.\n\nThe show premiered on Feb. 6 and ran for only three months until Amazon axed it, reported Deadline.

Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., and Abrego Garcia at a table with what appear to be margaritas, was posted by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele after his government finally allowed the lawmaker to meet with the man who was accidentally deported there last month. \n\n'Kilmar Abrego Garcia, miraculously risen from the 'death camps' & 'torture', now sipping margaritas with Sen. Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!' Bukele captioned the images posted to X on Thursday. \n\nBut Van Hollen sought to set the record straight after returning to the U.S. on Friday, telling a throng of reporters at a Virginia airport after returning from his trip that the drinks were set out by the country's president. \n\n'So here's what happened, when I first sat down with Kilmar, we just had glasses of water, maybe some coffee, and as we were talking one of the government people came over and deposited two other glasses on the table with ice and I don't know if it was salt or sugar around the top, but they look like margaritas,' Van Hollen said.\n\n'And if you look at the one they put in front of Kilmar, it actually had a little less liquid than the one in me in front of me to try to make it look, I assumed, like he drank out of it.'\n\n'Let me just be very clear, neither of us touched the drinks that were in front of us, and if you want to play a little Sherlock Holmes, I'll tell you how you can know that,' the senator explained. \n\nHe claimed that because of the salt (or sugar) covered rims, he could prove that neither he nor Kilmar imbibed during the welfare check Van Hollen had been demanding for days whilst on a highly-publicized trip to advocate for Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. \n\nPictured: Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen sits with deported illegal migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia with drinks that some claimed were margaritas. This image was posted by El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele, whose workers brought out the drinks for the alleged MS-13 member and Democrat \n\nVan Hollen, however, does not have any margaritas in the picture his team posted online. He claims the country's president set him up with the drinks that neither he nor Kilmar tried \n\nVan Hollen addressing the press after returning to the U.S. on Friday \n\n'If you sip out of one of those glasses, some of whatever was salt or sugar would disappear,' the Democrat told the press. 'You would see a gap. There's no gap.'\n\nSomeone in the crowd immediately blurted out 'There's no gap!' \n\nThe lawmaker also addressed the more serious issue of being set up by Bukele.\n\n'Nobody drank any margaritas or sugar water or whatever it is. But this is a lesson. It's the lengths that President Bukele will do to deceive people about what's going on, and it's also shows the lengths that the Trump administration and the President will go to,' the Democrat charged. \n\nVan Hollen caught a lot of flak online over the image as users tore into him for flying to another country to advocate for a non-citizen and alleged MS-13 member while citizens in Maryland have been targeted by migrants. \n\nThe Democrat senator who traveled to El Salvador to meet with a deported illegal migrant and alleged MS-13 member was seen drinking what appeared to be margaritas, infuriating many online.\n\nPopular Trump-aligned accounts on X, including Libs of TikTok, slammed Van Hollen for his cozy chat with deported thug.\n\nOne person pointed out that in Van Hollen's official post on X, he didn't include the picture showing the margarita glasses. \n\nAnother responded directly to the senator's post and said, 'Hey Chris!! This is the real picture. How were those margaritas??? President Bukele posted this one. No hiding the truth from America.'\n\nA third wrote: 'Senator Chris Van Hollen and Kilmar Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with salted rims…Thirsty Thursday in El Salvador.' \n\nEl Salvador President Nayib Bukele, who met with President Donald Trump this week, shared the photo of the supposedly alcoholic drinks\n\nVan Hollen has not responded to the social media outrage yet, but in his post about the meeting, he said he called Abrego Garcia's wife 'to pass along his message of love.' \n\nThe lawmaker did not provide an update on the status of Abrego Garcia, whose attorneys are fighting to force the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.\n\nA spokesman for the Trump administration remained on message, claiming Van Hollen was worried more about a 'terrorist' illegal migrant than his own constituents.\n\n'Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist. It is truly disgusting. President Trump will continue to stand on the side of law-abiding Americans,' Kush Desai told DailyMail.com.\n\nBukele's post on X ended with emojis of the U.S. and El Salvador flags, with a handshake emoji between them. A spokeswoman for El Salvador´s presidency said she had no further information. \n\nThe meeting came hours after Van Hollen said he was denied entry into an high-security El Salvador prison Thursday while he was trying to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being and push for his release.\n\nThe Democratic senator said at a news conference in San Salvador that his car was stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about two miles from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, even as they let other cars go on.\n\n'They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,' Van Hollen said. \n\nAbrego Garcia was sent to an El Salvador prison by the Trump administration in March despite an immigration court order preventing his deportation\n\nVan Hollen did not provide an update on the status of Abrego Garcia (pictured), whose attorneys are fighting to force the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the US\n\nAbrego Garcia entered the US illegally in 2011. A judge blocked his return to El Salvador in 2019, citing the fact that gangsters were after him, but said he could be deported elsewhere. \n\nIn court filings this week, the Trump administration said he was deported to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court has since ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the US. \n\nLate Thursday, a three-judge panel from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused to suspend a judge's decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials to determine if they complied with the court's instruction to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. \n\nThe Trump administration´s claims that it can't do anything to free Garcia from an El Salvador prison or return him to the US 'should be shocking to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear,' the court said Thursday in a blistering order that ratchets up the escalating conflict between the government's executive and judicial branches. \n\nJudge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated by Republican President Ronald Reagan, said: 'It is difficult in some cases to get to the very heart of the matter. But in this case, it is not hard at all.' \n\nHe added that he and his two colleagues 'cling to the hope that it is not naïve to believe our good brethren in the Executive Branch perceive the rule of law as vital to the American ethos.'\n\nTrump officials insist Garcia is not an innocent American, as claimed. They say he's an MS-13 gangster who deserves to be sent back to El Salvador. \n\nAdditionally, a 2021 petition for protection from domestic violence filled out by Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez, which was obtained first by DailyMail.com, states that the alleged MS-13 member beat his wife multiple times over the years. \n\nVan Hollen posted a photo of the meeting on X, saying he also called Abrego Garcia's wife 'to pass along his message of love'\n\nShe told The Post she was 'acting out of caution after a disagreement with Kilmar … in case things escalated' after being abused 'in a previous relationship.'\n\n'Things did not escalate, and I decided not to follow through with the civil court process. We were able to work through this situation privately as a family, including by going to counseling,' she added.\n\n'Our marriage only grew stronger in the years that followed. No one is perfect, and no marriage is perfect.'\n\nDemocrats, furious about his deportation, are up in arms, with Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen traveling in an attempt to get answers. \n\nDetermined to save Garcia, he flew to El Salvador in an effort to get him out of jail and back in America. \n\nBut when he showed up asking for a meeting, he was denied. \n\nHe is now being mocked by Republicans and Conservative Americans, including the mother of a woman who was murdered by an illegal migrant. \n\n'Senator Van Hollen has done more to bring a MS-13 gang member, human trafficker and illegal alien back to Maryland than he has to help keep his American constituents safe or advocate for the victims of these vicious gangs like MS-13. \n\n'While Senator Van Hollen and the mainstream media peddle a sob story about a brutal MS-13 gang member, Secretary Noem stands with the victims of illegal alien crime, like Maryland mom Rachel Morin. \n\nA2021 petition for protection from domestic violence filled out by Abrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer Vasquez (pictured), which was obtained first by DailyMail.com, states that the alleged MS-13 member beat his wife multiple times over the years\n\n'We hear far too much about the gang members and criminals sob stories and not enough about their victims,' the Department of Homeland Security said in a post on X. \n\nThe efforts by Van Hollen have also been criticized by Morin's mother Patty who spoke about the lack of any correspondence from state officials when her daughter was murdered. \n\nSpeaking on Fox News with anchor Sean Hannity, she said: 'I'm very angry, I'm outraged. I'm too sad at the moment to show anger at the same time.\n\n'He did not call our family, he did not give condolences. There was no action [from] the Democratic party in anyway. \n\n'From Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, anyone here in Maryland, none of the Senators did anything to help search for the murderer of my daughter.'\n\nRachel Morin's illegal immigrant killer Victor Martinez-Hernandez was found guilty of first degree murder, first degree rape and kidnapping on Monday - and is now awaiting sentencing. \n\nAbrego Garcia, who is a legal resident, arrived at the notorious supermax prison CECOT in El Salvador March 15 on one of three planes from the US.\n\nHe first entered the U.S. in 2011 but was granted permission to stay by a judge in 2019. He later settled down in Maryland and has an American wife and son.\n\nAbrego Garcia (pictured), who is a legal resident, arrived at the notorious supermax prison CECOT in El Salvador March 15 on one of three planes from the US\n\nDemocratic Senator from Maryland Chris Van Hollen speaks to the press in Antiguo Cuscatlan, El Salvador. Van Hollen arrived in El Salvador to request the release of Abrego Garcia \n\nThe Trump administration deported Abrego Garcia on March 15 after files indicated that he had connections with MS-13, a vicious Salvadorian-American gang.\n\nHis wife and lawyer deny his gang affiliation and have sued the administration for improperly removing him from the U.S.\n\nThe Trump administration initially said his removal was a mistake. The Supreme Court then ordered the facilitation of his return. \n\nBut the Trump administration is standing firm. \n\nIn the Oval Office on Monday, Trump and Bukele led a united defense of their actions in the case of Abrego Garcia.\n\nBukele argued he couldn't return, saying: 'How can I return him to the United States?\n\n'I smuggle him into the United States or what do I do? Of course, I'm not going to do it.\n\n'The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don't have the power to return him to the United States.'\n\nTrump supported Bukele's claim and went further, lobbying the El Salvadorian leader to take more migrants and build more prisons hold them.\n\n'I just asked the president, you know, it's this massive complex that he built, a jail complex. I said, 'Can you build some more of them, please?'' Trump said.\n\nMarylandDonald TrumpPolitics\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDemocrat Chris Van Hollen claims he was given 'fake margaritas' by El Salvador's President Bukele\n\nAdd comment","summary":"The Democrat senator who traveled to El Salvador to meet with deported migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia swears that he was set up by the nation's president for an unfortunate photo-op.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14626715/Democrat-Chris-Van-Hollen-ridiculed-hilarious-reason-didnt-drink-fake-margaritas-El-Salvador-alleged-MS-13-gangster.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/18/05/97416219-0-image-a-18_1744949478317.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/16/1734277532721528733/1024x576_MP4_1734277532721528733.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-18 22:14:16","author":"Editor,James Cirrone,Jon Michael Raasch","authors":["Editor","James Cirrone","Jon Michael Raasch"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":312575636,"title":"Katy Perry gears up for sci-fi inspired world tour","text":"In less than a year, Katy Perry has released an album, campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris and, just this week, flown to space. As she heads to Mexico City to kick off a world tour on Wednesday, the pop superstar shows no intention of slowing down.\n\n“I’m always open and I say, ‘Why not?’ and ‘Let’s just try,’” she told The Associated Press recently at her Southern California rehearsal space. “The power of your thoughts are so incredible because everything starts with a thought. I had this thought, ‘I want to go on tour.’ And here we are.”\n\nWith that openness to try comes accepting that not every endeavor will be a victory. Her September album, “143,” was critically panned, and she was simultaneously criticized for reuniting with embattled producer Dr. Luke. Celebrities like Olivia Munn and Emily Ratajkowski critiqued the spaceflight’s use of resources as superfluous and indulgent. And Harris ultimately lost the November election to President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Perry’s longevity and the scale of her fame since her 2008 breakout hit, “I Kissed a Girl,” are attributable at least in part to her willingness to get back up in the wake of a setback, as she belts in her 2013 empowerment anthem, “Roar.” \n\n“I can control what I can control,” she said.\n\nThat mantra has been refined over the past 15 years through her practice of Transcendental Meditation. The meditation technique has been embraced by a handful of celebrities, including — perhaps most zealously — the late David Lynch, whom Perry credits with spreading the practice and its message.\n\n“That changed my life. And I’ve gone on a long inner space journey to untangle some wires, to answer some questions, to become more grounded, to find the power within myself,” she said.\n\nPerry is fascinated by all things spiritual, casually weaving into conversation references to astrology, the enneagram and cardology, which purports to impart mystical insights into an individual’s personality through playing cards. Perry also credits having her daughter, Daisy, with propelling her along a journey of self-discovery and enhancing her “feminine divine.”\n\n“Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she said. “I think I’ve just grown into the strong woman that I’ve always dreamed of and idolized.”\n\nThat journey has informed her approach to music and performing, down to the narrative of her sci-fi themed “Lifetimes Tour.” Citing films like “Blade Runner” and “The Fifth Element” as visual and thematic inspirations, Perry will play a video game character who faces off against evil forces.\n\n“It’s really about believing in yourself and leading with love. Those are always my messages, no matter how I wrap it or whatever tour I bring. It’s love and empowerment,” she said. “When I can lead by example, it just ripples.”\n\nPerry’s tour of more than 80 performances will primarily be a career-spanning showcase of past hits, but with a dance-infused flare to some of the traditional pop songs. “I tell everybody they have to wear some sensible shoes,” she explained.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since Perry emerged as a pop star, she has made tongue in cheek lyricism — in line with her “very sarcastic” sense of humor — and catchy messages of empowerment a signature of her songs. Critical reception to her more recent albums has been less than enthusiastic, but that hasn't stopped the 40-year-old from going all out for this tour, calling it “Disneyland on wheels.”\n\n“I feel a responsibility to my audience who have really been with me on this ride during this whole lifetime to give them that feeling that they had when they first heard 'Teenage Dream,'\" she said.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Numerous faith-based organizations warn that not bringing back the long-running process could \"indefinitely\" hurt individuals attempting to reunite with loved ones.Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment.Why It MattersThe executive order \"Realigning the United States Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP)\" was signed on January 20, just after Trump was inaugurated. It went into effect just after midnight on January 27, suspending the program for 90 days to allow U.S. officials to determine \"whether resumption of entry of refugees into the United States under the USRAP would be in the interests of the United States.\"That 90-day deadline is set to expire on Easter Sunday. Trump administration officials are claimed to have not made any contact with Christian groups in favor of rescinding the order.What To KnowIn 2024, the majority of the 100,034 refugees who resettled to the U.S. were Christians, and 29,493 Christians among them came from 50 countries where Christians face the most severe persecution, according to church watchdog Open Doors US.The Trump administration tied USRAP to the U.S. being \"inundated with record levels of migration\" over the past four years, specifically mentioning \"significant influxes of migrants\" in cities including Charleroi, Pennsylvania, and Springfield, Ohio—the latter of which drew widespread attention during the 2024 presidential race when Trump, during a debate against former Vice President Kamala Harris, falsely claimed that migrants were eating dogs and cats.In his first week in office during his first term as president, Trump set the maximum number of refugees to be admitted at 50,000.On Thursday, the Christian organization World Relief rereleased a statement urging the Trump administration to reconsider its motives and restart the resettlement process.Even with the suspension, they say that churches, individual Christians, and other supporters have contributed more than $10 million to World Relief in the past three months \"in response to gaps created by the administration's abrupt termination of pre-committed funds for already-resettled refugees and vulnerable people elsewhere around the globe.\"A spokesperson for the organization told Newsweek that as of Thursday, more than 20,000 Christians from all 50 states had signed onto the statement. They include local pastors, denominational leaders, influential authors and podcasters, leaders of prominent national and state-based Christian advocacy organizations, and advocates for persecuted Christians globally.\"In terms of what's next for refugee resettlement, if resettlement is not resumed, it will mean refugees who were scheduled to be resettled in late January or early February— including many who have U.S.-based family who was desperate to be reunited to them—will have their hopes deferred even further, potentially indefinitely,\" Matthew Soerens, vice president of advocacy and policy at the Christian organization World Relief, told Newsweek.He added: \"For many, that means being stuck in a refugee camp where they'd already lived for years or even decades, usually denied the legal authority to work and support themselves, and at a time when reductions to U.S. funding are also restricting access to support for food and other basic necessities for many refugees in camp settings globally.\"A decision of the U.S. to halt all resettlement could lead some host countries to decide to deport certain people who no longer have any likelihood of being resettled back to danger, Soerens added. That includes Afghans in Pakistan, such as those who will face persecution by the Taliban because of their Christian faith or because of their service to the U.S. military.World Relief and partner groups also argue that the longstanding U.S. refugee resettlement program aligns with the Trump administration's goals of securing borders through lawful means of legal immigration.Efforts by World Relief to meet with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Vice President JD Vance, and White House Faith Office Director Jennifer Korn have all been ignored, a spokesperson told Newsweek.It's not just resettlement that has halted. A private sponsorship program for refugee resettlement called Welcome Corps, which included private groups subsidizing resettlement costs instead of taxpayers, was suspended. Officials say that persecuted Christians in countries like Iran have been \"in limbo.\"\"Ongoing suspension of refugee resettlement will also mean that local churches who have been engaged in refugee ministry for many years as a tangible expression of their Christian faith will be denied the opportunity to welcome newly arriving refugees, including those who have raised funds to cover the costs of resettlement through the Welcome Corps private sponsorship process,\" Soerens said.\"Of course, we can and will continue to care for the refugees already present within our communities, but many churches have provided the most intensive support to refugees within their first several months after arrival, when they need the most support, and those opportunities are now suspended.\"What People Are SayingNational Association of Evangelicals President Walter Kim: \"President Trump can lead the nation in rescuing persecuted Christians, as well as believers of other faiths, by restoring and strengthening the U.S. refugee resettlement program. As the son of a refugee from North Korea, I am alive today because my father was given refuge in South Korea and immigrated to the United States.\"Katie Frugé, executive director of the Texas Baptist Christian Life Commission: \"America's longstanding commitment to religious freedom at home and abroad has made it a beacon of hope for persecuted Christians around the globe. I pray that our nation will continue to rise as a protector of those tormented by religious persecution, upholding our great tradition of compassion and strength.\"Christian author Jen Pollock Michel: \"Refugee resettlement is not only a Christian priority, given our biblical commitment to protect the most globally vulnerable. It's something the majority of Americans support. I urge President Trump to re-establish a humanitarian program that has historically brought hope to the persecuted and war-torn of the world.\"Doug Sauder, lead pastor of Calvary Chapel Fort Lauderdale: \"The Christian church has a great tradition of caring for refugees. This tradition comes from a clear mandate in Scripture that we care for the widow, the orphan and the refugee. In every society through the last 2,000 years, Christians have advocated for the care of these vulnerable people groups, and the refugee resettlement program and the work of World Relief should continue its good work as we resettle persecuted Christians and those who have helped our nation at a great cost to themselves.\"What Happens NextThe Sunday deadline could impact countless refugees who had anticipated coming to the U.S. earlier this year. It remains unclear whether the Trump administration will waver on the executive order.","summary":"More than 20,000 Christians signed a petition urging Trump to reconsider an executive order signed on his first day in office.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/christians-refugees-trump-petition-resettlement-immigration-2061608","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2629885/refugees.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 20:15:36","author":"Nick Mordowanec","authors":["Nick Mordowanec"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":312560168,"title":"Anti-Trump Podcaster Calls Joe Rogan ‘Jerk’ Who ‘Spreads Lies’","text":"Ben Meiselas flamed rival podcaster Joe Rogan during a discussion about whether Kamala Harris should have appeared on Rogan’s show during the 2024 campaign. \n\n“To me, Rogan’s a jerk and he spreads lies,” Meiselas said on a new episode The People’s Cabinet podcast, slamming the pro-MAGA podcaster. \n\nMeiselas co-hosts the left-leaning MeidasTouch podcast with his brothers Brett and Jordan.

And that's not right.'","text":"Lisa Murkowski, Alaska's longtime U.S. senator, was home from Washington this week, touching base. As part of her rounds, the Republican lawmaker appeared in Anchorage before an annual meeting of tribal leaders and nonprofit executives. Inevitably, the discussion turned to the wrecking-ball presidency of Donald Trump and his autocratic and, frankly, un-American penchant for siccing the government on his political foes. Asked what she had to say to those living in fear, or who represent constituents afraid of today's McCarthyesque climate, Murkowski responded with honesty and bracing candor. \"We are all afraid,\" she said. She then paused five long seconds, her face a rictus of wonderment and concern, allowing the observation and admission — from a sitting member of the United States Senate, no less — to sink in. “It’s quite a statement,\" Murkowski went on. Another brief pause, then several starts and stops. \"But we're in a time and a place where ... I've not been here before,\" she said. \"And I’ll tell you, I’m oftentimes very anxious myself about using my voice, because retaliation is real. And that’s not right.” It's a fine pass we've come to when simply speaking the truth and stating the obvious are considered newsworthy, much less an act of courage. But here we are, folks. America, 2025. If you wish to be cynical, there are reasons why Murkowski — whose comments Monday quickly ricocheted across the country — may be more prepared to speak out against Trump than her timorous Republican peers. Trump easily carried Alaska all three times he ran for president. But his showing — the 54% of the vote he received in November was a high mark — is a shadow of his blowout victories elsewhere. Trump won Wyoming with 70% of the vote, West Virginia with 68% and Oklahoma and North Dakota with 65% support. His executive order changing the name of North America’s tallest peak, Denali, back to Mt. McKinley has landed among Alaskans with a decided thud. A survey of adult residents found they opposed the switch by more than 2 to 1. In other words, the Last Frontier is not exactly head over heels for Trump. Besides, Murkowski won't face reelection — should she decide to run for a fifth term — until 2028, when Trump's time in office will finally, mercifully be winding down. Those factors, however, don't take away from the starch in the senator's spine or her willingness to stand up while so many others in her party cower in submission. Give Murkowski her due: She doesn't shrink from a fight. In 2010, she notched a rare write-in victory after losing the GOP nomination to a right-wing \"tea party\" Republican. In 2021, Murkowski was one of just seven Republican senators — and the only one to face constituents in the next election cycle — to vote to convict Trump in an impeachment trial for inciting the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol. Her act drew a censure from state GOP leaders and the petulance you would expect from Trump, who urged some Republican, any Republican — “If you have a pulse, I’m with you!” — to challenge Murkowski's reelection. When Kelly Tshibaka, a 2020 election denier, stepped forward, Trump appeared at an Anchorage rally to lend his support. Murkowski won anyway. She may be the state's most popular living politician, said Amy Lovecraft, a political science professor at the University of Alaska in Fairbanks. \"She knows the state,\" Lovecraft said. \"She gets stuff done. She's a doer.\" She's also outspokenly independent, a rare commodity in today's increasing cult-like GOP. In fact, the whole notion of checks and balances — a foundational principle of American democracy — has gone out the window, Murkowski suggested in Anchorage. \"Right now, we are not balancing as the Congress,\" she said, expressing concern, as well, over Trump's attempted undermining of the judiciary. Murkowski has taken on Trump more than once. She refused to vote for him in 2024 — she didn't support Kamala Harris, either — and was one of the few Republicans in office to publicly condemn Trump's shameful pardon of the Jan. 6 insurrectionists. She opposed Pete Hegseth's risible nomination as Defense secretary and voted to undo Trump's heedless tariffs on Canada. She's also expressed concerns about Elon Musk's wanton assault on federal employees. \"Things are happening so fast through this Department of Government Efficiency, DOGE\" — the fictive name of Musk's made-up agency — \"None of us understand the half of it. It’s literally piecing it together,” Murkowski told those gathered in Anchorage. Speaking on Monday to the Alaska Daily News, Muskowski recounted numerous conversations with some of those summarily fired in Musk's precipitous purge. Many were in tears. \"They thought that they were in a profession they've given so much to and thought that they were doing well,\" Murkowski said. \"And literally, with no notice whatsoever, [they were] terminated and told that their work performance was not satisfactory, which was not true. \"These are real emotions. These are real people,\" she said. \"These are real fears and they need to be heard.\" Indeed. Sadly, for now, Murkowski is one of vanishingly few Republican politicians with the guts to speak up against the party's rogue president — a brave, but lone, voice in the wilderness.","summary":"Sen.

The “212” rapper said on Wednesday (April 16) that she regrets casting a vote for Trump in last year’s presidential election.\n\n Banks took to X and wrote that “we made a f—ing mess” voting to put Trump back on the Oval Office. “Like this is an absolute disaster.”\n\n Banks then trolled Gayle King while posting a photo of the CBS Mornings co-host from her Blue Origin space flight. “Trump supporters rn,” she wrote while taking a shot at the journalist.\n\n The Harlem native feels like Trump — who in 2024 was convicted of 34 felony crimes in his hush money trial — hasn’t done a good job with the responsibility of leading the country in his hands.\n\n “He’s so petty and vindictive rn,” she wrote. “Tbh, rightfully so, but not when the wellbeing and livelihood of billions of people – damn near the entire world lay in ur hands . Someone needs to get him a cute little lorazepam rx and a high grade ashwaganda supplement because it can’t happen like this.”\n\n There’s been plenty of debate on Trump’s policies when it comes to the economy and his negotiations with countries such China and Canada, which have led to a minimum 10% tariff for all nations. According to the White House’s website in a post dated April 15, “China faces up to a 245% tariff on imports to the United States as a result of its retaliatory actions.”\n\n Banks also showed support for China in her X messages: “Nobody on earth is afraid of crazy old white man anger. Old white men need to reinvent the archetype because it’s too predictable. Like China is just DUNKING on everyone right now Tbh I love that for China tho. And really do love China in general . China is the Doll.”\n\n Azealia Banks has been a staunch Trump supporter in the past, as she voted for him in 2016 and pulled up to one of his rallies in Florida last year. However, she’s been anti-Elon Musk, who leads the Department of Government Efficiency, and says the Tesla CEO “belongs nowhere near American Politics.”\n\n Musk’s involvement with the twice-impeached president led to her giving an 11th-hour endorsement to Kamala Harris. However, she later admitted to voting for Trump in the end anyway.","summary":"\"We made a f---ing mess,\" she wrote to X.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/azealia-banks-regrets-donald-trump-vote-1235950200/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/azealia-banks-live-2022-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 19:29:13","author":"Michael Saponara","authors":["Michael Saponara"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.086},{"id":312560162,"title":"Why Does Everyone Hate Katy Perry So Much?","text":"The world’s rotation these days is propelled by the power of the division, polarization, discord, and vitriolic disagreement that exists on it. Thus it’s a surprise for the earth to briefly stand still in a moment of unity. And that seems to be over the hatred of Katy Perry. \n\nHow ironic that one major source of that ire is Perry’s recent trip to gaze at that world from the lower limits of space. Did she know what we were saying about her down here while she was looking out the window of the rocket up there? (She apparently sang a snippet of “What a Wonderful World” while in flight; either she was oblivious or she’s trolling us all.)\n\nPerry was a part of the all-female team on the Blue Origin spaceflight, alongside Gayle King, Lauren Sánchez, and several other formidable women who the media have largely ignored because of the morbid horror that Jeff Bezos, who funded the mission, might be propelling a major pop star and Oprah’s BFF to certain death. \n\nNow that the mission returned safely—that is [puts on tinfoil hat] if the trip happened at all!!!—disgust over the stunt has eclipsed any girl-power-STEM enthusiasm and future-of-humanity goals the mission was supposed to accomplish.\n\nWhat it did accomplish: unifying the Olivias (Munn and Wilde) in a public shaming of their celebrity sisters for the “gluttonous” space ride that distracts and siphons resources from real issues facing mankind. \n\nFellow celebrity Jessica Chastain shared The Guardian’s essay titled, “The Blue Origin Flight Showcased the Utter Defeat of American Feminism.” It’s a pretty brutal one. The line “the flight served as a kind of perverse funeral for the America that once enabled both scientific advancement and feminist progress” is just the beginning.\n\nBut it was Perry who bore the brunt of the thinkpieces. The Atlantic called her “the perfect pop star for a dumb stunt.” And a fiery Pitchfork piece titled “In Space, No One Can Hear You Girlboss” was giddily shared all over social media, particularly for this absolutely savage—and wholly entertaining—read: \n\n“This trip is also kind of the next logical step for Perry’s career. And look, I’m an empath, I get it. If I had written a few perfect songs in 2010, had never been able to replicate their magic, and was somehow worth $350 million dollars, I would probably also embark on a quest for meaning in the journeywork of the stars. Would I be honest with myself and admit to the world that this was just a million dollar carnival ride dissembling as a publicity stunt, that we are not space revolutionaries but rather celebs in couture trying to milk a few days of earned media paid for by Amazon? Who can say.”\n\nYou would think that would be as harsh as it could possibly get when it comes to the Katy Perry pile-on. But then again, no one expected fast-food chain Wendy’s to enter the fray. The burger slinger’s X account posted “Can we send her back?,” inciting a whole news cycle including a response from insiders “close” to Perry decrying the bullying from the House of Frosty. With this feud, one could say Wendy’s finally “found the beef.” (Ba-dum-ching!)\n\nBut why is it Perry who is the focus of this ill-will? She wasn’t the only person on the flight. But she is the easiest target.\n\nUnlike Perry, who is now, thanks to Blue Origin, “excited to learn more about STEM,” I am neither scientific nor mathematical. But I am well-versed in the practice of something else: gauging vibes. \n\nThe vibes on Perry, at least online and among cultural obsessives, have not been great for years. \n\nShe hasn’t had a Top 10 hit since 2016, with each successive “flop” record becoming a meme about how she doesn’t make good music anymore. \n\nThe lead single off her latest record, “Woman’s World,” was mocked as a laughably obtuse—and unlistenable—attempt to capitalize on a Kamala Harris-led feminist moment. The rumor that Perry offered the song to Harris to use for her campaign, and Harris politely passed, only added to the humiliation—which the cruel internet in turn celebrated. \n\nShe’s never really been “canceled,” but she’s not without controversy. Never forget that her attempt to buy a convent, against the wishes of its sisters, was so aggressive that one nun’s dying words were allegedly, “Katy Perry, please stop.” And then there was her voting booth selfie showing that she voted for polarizing candidate Rick Caruso for L.A. mayor, rankling liberal fans who were alarmed by Caruso’s political leanings. \n\nGenerally, though, as her music career has stagnated, Perry has projected a mixture of excessive enthusiasm and dire desperation, a combination that can only be described as the most lethal of Very Online words: “cringe.”\n\nSo a much maligned spaceflight on top of that? Perry herself was laying up the ball for everyone to dunk on her. (Did I do that sports metaphor right?)\n\nWe want our popstars woke. They need to serve bops and demand social justice simultaneously, or else feel our wrath. Whatever good work Perry has done on those fronts over her career, taking a billion-dollar trip to space on a rocket funded by the left’s Dr. Evil, Jeff Bezos, squashes it. Worse, she isn’t even giving us good music while she does it. \n\nThis isn’t the end of Perry’s career. She’s going on a massive tour, which she, in another cringe move, promoted from space. She’s talented. All it takes is one good song to salvage a pop star’s reputation. \n\nPlus, we all know how this controversy is going to end: Katy Perry starring in a Wendy’s Super Bowl commercial set in outer space.","summary":"Photo Illustration by Eric Faison/The Daily Beast/Getty ImagesThe world’s rotation these days is propelled by the power of the division, polarization, discord, and vitriolic disagreement that exists on it.

In Britain, where I live, Prime Minister Keir Starmer has given a range of tortured answers, before eventually settling on “an adult female.” This week, the country’s highest court has endorsed that view.\n\nInterpreting Britain’s flagship civil-rights law, the Equality Act of 2010, the Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the “concept of sex is binary, a person is either a woman or a man.” By unanimous decision, the five justices hearing the case decreed that the terms man, woman, and sex used there “refer to biological sex.” They also stressed that their ruling applied only to interpreting anti-discrimination law, and was not a wider judgment on the validity of transgender identities.\n\nIn everyday life, many Americans and Britons, including me, are happy to use people’s chosen names and pronouns, and take their asserted identities at face value. But in some situations covered by the Equality Act, individuals’ biological sex—a matter of verifiable fact—is more relevant than the gender with which they identify.\n\nThis week’s ruling most immediately affects women-only services, such as domestic-violence shelters, single-sex hospital wards, and prisons—places where women’s dignity, privacy, and physical safety are paramount. Men could already be legally excluded from such services. The implications of the ruling also extend into other emotionally fraught situations: Is a rape victim entitled to request a forensic examination by someone of the same biological sex? Are lesbian dating meetups allowed to exclude trans women without risking a legal challenge? The court now says yes.\n\nAt the same time, the court was keen to stress that transgender people have their own legal protections. If a trans woman is discriminated against by someone who reads her as a woman, that can be sex discrimination. And if she is discriminated against simply for being trans, then that falls under another protected characteristic in the Equality Act, “gender reassignment.” Critics of the British ruling have focused on the fact that trans women will be denied access to certain women’s facilities. However, the ruling enhances the rights of trans men, who have reassurance that they can sue for pregnancy and maternity discrimination based on their biology.\n\nThe U.K. judgment shows that society can separate out the distinct forms of discrimination faced by biological females and trans women, without denying that either group has a valid claim to protection under the law, or that trans women may deeply feel themselves to be women. “It is not the role of the court to adjudicate on the arguments in the public domain on the meaning of gender or sex,” the ruling states, “nor is it to define the meaning of the word ‘woman’ other than when it is used in the provisions of the EA 2010.”\n\nFor more than a decade, the LGBTQ movement has argued that “trans women are women” and that no attempt should ever be made to treat the two groups differently. But are women discriminated against because of their biology, or because of what the trans theorist Julia Serano has termed femmephobia? One definition would apply to trans women, and the other would not. The British gender-critical feminist movement—which maintains that sex should take precedence over gender in law—has argued that biology, rather than identity, is what stops employers from hiring women in their 30s, because bosses are worried about having to pay for maternity leave. Biology is why no woman can run a 100-meter race as fast as Usain Bolt. Biological males commit the overwhelming majority of sexual and violent offenses. The research on gender identity and criminality is limited, but the most relevant study found that trans women followed a pattern more typical of males than of females.\n\nIn Britain, unlike in America, the debate about whether and when gender matters more than sex has not been strictly a matter of right versus left. In the United States, the debate is divided in a more classically partisan way: the best-known critics of trans inclusion include the swimmer Riley Gaines, who attended the signing of one of President Donald Trump’s executive orders on gender; Representative Nancy Mace, who demanded that her trans colleague, Sarah McBride, not use women’s bathrooms at the Capitol; and the conservative influencer Matt Walsh, who made a 2022 documentary called What Is a Woman? As a result, liberals and leftists approach the issue with extreme trepidation. Many try to dodge it altogether, as Kamala Harris did in the 2024 election, without acknowledging that there are legitimate grounds for disagreements. The U.S. debate has been shaped around the analogy between gay rights and trans rights for the purpose of civil-rights legislation. Any mention of bathrooms is also more fraught, because it evokes a time when Black citizens were denied the right to use whites-only facilities.\n\nHere in the U.K., however, the earliest high-profile proponent of the gender-critical movement was Julie Bindel, a radical feminist lesbian whose background is in campaigning for women in prison, and whose partner is a human-rights lawyer. Many of the women who have won employment-tribunal cases over harassment and dismissal for their gender-critical views were employed at NGOs, at universities, or in social work—all left-leaning sectors. Every major party of the left has a gender-critical caucus, such as the Labour Women’s Declaration and Liberal Voice for Women. True, the question “What is a woman?” has become a reliable gotcha for right-wing newspapers and TV channels in the U.K. But the gender-critical feminists who celebrated outside the court this week were mostly lifelong left-wingers.\n\nThe question of who counts as a woman reached Britain’s highest court thanks to a relatively minor issue. In recent years, the left-wing, pro-independence Scottish National Party has made transgender inclusion one of its flagship issues—evidence that it is more liberal and enlightened than its counterparts in England. In 2018, Scotland passed a law to encourage 50–50 gender representation for nonexecutive positions on public boards. The SNP defined women to include anyone “living as a woman.” Wait a minute, said the grassroots feminist group For Women Scotland. Did that mean a company could have a “gender-balanced” board that was composed of 100 percent biological males? Yes, said the Scottish government.\n\nFor Women Scotland then launched a crowdfunded legal challenge, to which the author J. K. Rowling contributed £70,000. The group’s appeal reached the Supreme Court in October—and ended in victory this week.\n\nFrom a British perspective, one thing that has been immediately striking is how broadly this week’s judgment has been accepted across the political spectrum. This is a dramatic reversal. To obtain a gender-recognition certificate in Britain, an applicant needs a medical diagnosis of dysphoria and assessment by an independent panel. Ten years ago, almost all the main British parties—Labour, the Conservatives, the SNP, the Liberal Democrats, the Greens—supported changing this to a policy of self-identification of gender, which would have eliminated the need for outside review. Today, only the Liberal Democrats and the Greens support self-ID.\n\nThe Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, who took strongly gender-critical positions when she was in government, described the ruling as a “victory for all of the women who faced personal abuse or lost their jobs for stating the obvious.” Labour’s Keir Starmer did not interrupt his Easter vacation to make a statement—in keeping with his longstanding aversion to getting involved with this issue—but his minister for women and equalities, Bridget Phillipson, said the ruling brought “clarity and confidence.” So great is Labour’s reversal on this issue that the leader of Scottish Labour, Anas Sarwar, even incorrectly claimed he had “always” been in favor of single-sex spaces. (In 2022, he whipped his party to vote for the Scottish bill that would have made gender a matter of pure self-identification. The law passed, but was blocked by the British government.)\n\nMost notable of all, the left-wing SNP, whose legislation led to the judgment, also accepted the ruling. Under its former leader Nicola Sturgeon, the party disdained gender-critical feminists, to the point that some left for a rival pro-independence party. However, the SNP’s current leader, John Swinney, has taken a more conciliatory approach and said the new ruling will now “underpin” his government’s approach to gender.\n\nLGBTQ organizations have responded more strongly, with Stonewall expressing “deep concern” about the ruling’s implications. What activists really fear is that the judgment will license MAGA-style attacks on the trans community—or that it is the first step toward banning legal gender changes altogether. (Under the Trump-friendly autocrat Viktor Orbán, Hungary has done this, along with passing a suite of other anti-LGBTQ measures.) “I fear this will be the beginning of a maximalist agenda to further undermine and often insult trans people, and their status in society,” the podcaster Lewis Goodall wrote on Substack. “With Trump’s victory, the ideological winds are finely attuned to this purpose.”\n\nBut the court’s careful judgment in London is a world away from recent executive orders from Washington. Liberal Americans who are tempted to depict the British court ruling as another outrage from Rowling’s coven of witches on “TERF island” should note this difference. The “adoption of a gender identity inconsistent with an individual’s sex conflicts with a soldier’s commitment to an honorable, truthful, and disciplined lifestyle, even in one’s personal life,” declared Trump’s executive order on the military—a statement that amounts to calling all trans people deliberate liars. By contrast, the first paragraph of the British judgment states that “the trans community is both historically and currently a vulnerable community.”\n\nThat seems right to me. It is entirely possible to condemn the language and overreach of Trump’s executive orders on gender while also supporting the judgment in London. Women face discrimination, and so do transgender people of both sexes, and the law can recognize that. At times, their rights must be balanced. This careful ruling has done exactly that.","summary":"The country’s highest court has ruled that under the Equality Act, woman means “biological female.”","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2025/04/britain-rules-woman-supreme-court/682511/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/jbRzl2q3OyKgm1lsvGS6iLisS-Q=/0x2:1712x894/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/04/2025_04_18_uk_az/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 18:50:38","author":"Helen Lewis","authors":["Helen Lewis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.02},{"id":312553688,"title":"Kamala Harris paid LeBron James' entertainment company $50,000 for 'campaign event production,' records show","text":"LeBron James' endorsement of Kamala Harris last year came with an added bonus for him.

By January, just six days before Trump took office, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau published a regulation that tribal leaders say isn’t legal and would harm the growing financial services industry on Indian lands. \n\nAt least four tribes are asking for the rule to be withdrawn, calling it an intrusion on tribal sovereignty and noting that tribes were never consulted. The latter point seemingly conflicted with President Joe Biden’s November 2022 pledge to bolster tribal consultations. \n\nAs online lending has grown as a tribal industry, in some cases, tribes have established their own financial regulatory agencies to police the businesses. \n\nOn Jan. 13, the CFPB published a proposed rule prohibiting financial institutions from including provisions in contracts in which customers could “waive substantive consumer legal rights” under federal and state laws to sue. Currently, a company and customer can mutually consent to a contract based on the laws of a specific state or country. \n\nAs sovereign entities with their own governments, Native American tribes experience unique effects from federal regulations, argued Louis Taylor, chairman of Lac Courte Oreilles Tribal Governing Board. \n\n“Therefore, our Tribe is at a loss to understand why no consultation whatsoever took place with tribal governments in relation to the proposed rule,” Taylor wrote to the CFPB. “This is particularly troubling given that the parts of the proposed rule … appear to seek the imposition of state law and the enforcement of state law upon sovereign Indian nations. After hundreds of years of fighting against attempted state government encroachments, our tribe and others simply cannot let such an attack on tribal sovereignty stand.” \n\nThe CFPB rule would infringe on the common practice of “choice of law” provision in contracts, which allows parties to contracts to determine what jurisdiction’s law the agreement will be governed by. \n\nThis is particularly important for tribal businesses, said Loyola University law professor Adam Crepelle, author of “Becoming Nations Again: The Journey Towards Tribal Self-Determination,”\n\n“Tribes rely heavily on economic development because they don’t have a tax base,” Crepelle told The Daily Signal. \n\nWhile many Americans associate economic development with casinos, increasingly tribes have been expanding into the financial services industry such as online lending, Crepelle said. \n\nAbout 30 tribes in mostly rural areas engage in online lending, Crepelle said. Online lending businesses have been a key for economic growth, tribal services and tribal development, according to the Native American Financial Services Association. \n\nMoreover, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which created the CFPB, recognizes tribes as states, Crepelle stressed, which makes the lack of consultation even more problematic. \n\nSeveral tribes weighed in opposing the regulation. Federal regulations are required to be open to public comment. \n\n“Our Tribe was very disappointed to see that the Bureau made no effort to engage with tribal governments regarding this Proposed Rule, particularly given that the Bureau is well aware of its consultation obligations under federal law and policy,” James Williams, the tribal chairman for the Lac Vieux Desert Band of Lake Superior Chippewa Indians, wrote to the CFPB in a public comment.\n\nWilliams notes the Lac Vieux Desert tribe launched an online lending business in 2011 as part of its economic development that supports the tribe’s governmental services such as education and social services programs, elder programs, housing, cultural and language programs, Tribal Court, and law enforcement. \n\n“In order to protect funds used by the tribe to support its citizens and its government, the tribal treasury must be protected against legal liability,” Williams continued.\n\nBig Valley Band of Pomo Indians Chairman Flaman McCloud, Jr. also raised objections to the CFPB regulation. \n\n“Such action is inconsistent with federal law and policy (including the Bureau’s own tribal consultation policy), which requires that consultation take place before any formal federal action is taken that could impact tribal rights and interests,” Flaman said. \n\nA CFPB spokesperson did not respond to several inquiries from The Daily Signal over the last week. But the bureau’s press release says it is ensuring companies cannot use contracts to opt out of statutes passed by Congress or state legislatures.\n\n“To access the American financial system, people should not be forced into forfeiting rights enshrined in law or our Constitution,” then-CFPB Director Rohit Chopra said in a public statement when the regulation was published. “Companies should not weaponize fine print to deplatform or purge people from the financial system.”\n\nTrump ousted Chopra, a Biden appointee, from the director’s position. The White House’s Department of Government Efficiency has targeted CFPB to close down. The agency has faced numerous controversies in recent years, including a major data breach and settling a racial discrimination lawsuit. \n\nTrump named Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent as the acting director of the CFPB after ousting Chopra. The Treasury Department did not respond to an inquiry for this story. \n\nHowever, the proposed regulation hasn’t been removed.\n\nOtoe-Missouria Tribe of Indians Chairman Jon R. Shotton argued the regulation would “unlawfully encroach on tribes’ ability to enact and be governed by their own laws, and it frustrates the federal policy of promoting tribal self-determination.” \n\n“It is a fundamental aspect of tribal sovereignty that tribes have the power to pursue tribal economic development, and current federal policy requires the protection and promotion of tribes’ ability to pursue this self-determination,” Shotton contends in public comment. “This exercise of tribal sovereignty and self-determination necessarily requires contractual freedom, including the right to freely negotiate issues such as choice-of-law, forum selection, and other dispute resolution procedures.” \n\nWhile she was a Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren, now a Massachusetts senator, was the architect of the CFPB. Interestingly, Warren famously pushed a now discredited story about having Native American heritage. \n\nSpokespersons from Warren’s office did not respond to inquiries from The Daily Signal for this story. \n\nBiden’s pledge for increased consultation focused on climate change but also stressed land use and economic development. Biden made the vow at the 2022 White House Tribal Nations Summit.\n\n“Democrats want to talk to American Indians when it fits their policy preference,” said Crepelle of Loyola.\n\nAn NBC exit poll by Edison Research after the 2024 election said 68% of Native Americans backed Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris. That’s more than 57% of the white population that voted for Trump. While some questioned whether Trump ran that well, since the poll was only of 10 key states, Politico later reported on Trump’s strong showing with native voters. \n\n“In his last administration, seven tribes gained federal recognition,” Crepelle said, “Objectively, Native Americans did well under Trump.”","summary":"In November, Donald Trump overwhelmingly carried the Native American vote.

(AP) — In less than a year, Katy Perry has released an album, campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris and, just this week, flown to space. As she heads to Mexico City to kick off a world tour on Wednesday, the pop superstar shows no intention of slowing down.\n\n“I’m always open and I say, ‘Why not?’ and ‘Let’s just try,’” she told The Associated Press recently at her Southern California rehearsal space. “The power of your thoughts are so incredible because everything starts with a thought. I had this thought, ‘I want to go on tour.’ And here we are.”\n\nWith that openness to try comes accepting that not every endeavor will be a victory. Her September album, “143,” was critically panned, and she was simultaneously criticized for reuniting with embattled producer Dr. Luke. Celebrities like Olivia Munn and Emily Ratajkowski critiqued the spaceflight’s use of resources as superfluous and indulgent. And Harris ultimately lost the November election to President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Perry’s longevity and the scale of her fame since her 2008 breakout hit, “I Kissed a Girl,” are attributable at least in part to her willingness to get back up in the wake of a setback, as she belts in her 2013 empowerment anthem, “Roar.”\n\n“I can control what I can control,” she said.\n\nThat mantra has been refined over the past 15 years through her practice of Transcendental Meditation. The meditation technique has been embraced by a handful of celebrities, including — perhaps most zealously — the late David Lynch, whom Perry credits with spreading the practice and its message.\n\n“That changed my life. And I’ve gone on a long inner space journey to untangle some wires, to answer some questions, to become more grounded, to find the power within myself,” she said.\n\nPerry is fascinated by all things spiritual, casually weaving into conversation references to astrology, the enneagram and cardology, which purports to impart mystical insights into an individual’s personality through playing cards. Perry also credits having her daughter, Daisy, with propelling her along a journey of self-discovery and enhancing her “feminine divine.”\n\n“Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she said. “I think I’ve just grown into the strong woman that I’ve always dreamed of and idolized.”\n\nThat journey has informed her approach to music and performing, down to the narrative of her sci-fi themed “Lifetimes Tour.” Citing films like “Blade Runner” and “The Fifth Element” as visual and thematic inspirations, Perry will play a video game character who faces off against evil forces.\n\n“It’s really about believing in yourself and leading with love. Those are always my messages, no matter how I wrap it or whatever tour I bring. It’s love and empowerment,” she said. “When I can lead by example, it just ripples.”\n\nPerry’s tour of more than 80 performances will primarily be a career-spanning showcase of past hits, but with a dance-infused flare to some of the traditional pop songs. “I tell everybody they have to wear some sensible shoes,” she explained.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since Perry emerged as a pop star, she has made tongue in cheek lyricism — in line with her “very sarcastic” sense of humor — and catchy messages of empowerment a signature of her songs. Critical reception to her more recent albums has been less than enthusiastic, but that hasn’t stopped the 40-year-old from going all out for this tour, calling it “Disneyland on wheels.”\n\n“I feel a responsibility to my audience who have really been with me on this ride during this whole lifetime to give them that feeling that they had when they first heard ‘Teenage Dream,’” she said.","summary":"Films like “Blade Runner” and “The Fifth Element” serve as visual and thematic inspirations for Perry's upcoming world tour.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/18/katy-perry-world-tour/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Music-Katy_Perry_56684-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 18:21:43","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.356},{"id":312551072,"title":"Shocking data shows how many Trump supporters regret voting for him","text":"In the short amount of time President Donald Trump has been in power during his second term, he has shaken domestic and global politics.\n\nReflecting on the time since the Republican reclaimed the Oval Office on January 20 of this year, the 78-year-old's administration has certainly been busy, signing more than 100 executive orders and even starting a trade war with China and the rest of the world... just to name a few things he's done.\n\nHis policies and behavior has been controversial at times, one instance of that being when Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy was invited to the White House, where he was berated by Vice-President JD Vance on international TV.\n\nIt's led to the question being posed as to whether those who voted for Trump would do so again if they were to return to the polling station tomorrow.\n\nCNN's data analyst Harry Enten dove into a YouGov poll that asked just that, and it revealed the shocking number of 'regretful' MAGA supporters there were.\n\n“I mean this is the big question, right?

Some of it sounds ideal — a desalination plant delivering ocean water as the primary water source and an excess of nuclear power plants making energy so affordable it barely registers as a bill. Travel is easy and affordable, with supersonic jetliners accessible to all.\n\nBut then come the darker aspects. In this futuristic abundance utopia, people don’t live in rural farming communities anymore because all farming is done in skyscrapers that use vertical farming technology. Meat is now grown in petri dishes. Artificial intelligence has reduced human work to the point that idleness is a virtue. Phones have been replaced by “micro earpieces,” and something called a “star pill” brings a life free of illness and addiction while slowing down aging and thus prolonging death.\n\nOn the surface, most of these things sound pretty nice. Less work, less disease, longer lives, more leisure, and more convenience in day-to-day life. Who would be against that? The world Klein and Thompson dream of is a utopian paradise of technological advancement and, to borrow a word, abundance.\n\nBut it is exactly that — a utopia. It is an attempt to build heaven on earth, a civilization built around the premise that human beings are destined simply for material pleasure. Less work means more play and more play means more happiness, or so the thinking goes. To that end, the Abundance agenda is fundamentally a transhumanist one, an agenda that believes technology holds the secret to life, allowing humanity to “transcend” its limits.\n\nSome weeks ago, I highlighted the transhumanist influences that have found a home in the Trump coalition, largely in the person of Elon Musk. Like Klein and Thompson, Musk believes that technology is the great liberator of mankind. With it, we can harness the power of the universe and build a prosperous utopia for all.\n\nBut while Musk believes a prosperous utopia will come exclusively from private enterprise and that any government involvement is an obstacle to it, Klein and Thompson believe the government has a duty to facilitate the creation of this utopia. Pass better laws and regulations and partner with private industry to create an era of abundance in which everyone is happy and wealthy.\n\nIn this sense, the bill of goods that is sold in Abundance is simply another side of Musk’s tech-bro utopia coin.\n\nMuch like Musk’s Silicon Valley vision of utopia, the utopia of Abundance is a false promise. Sure, some of the prescriptions Klein and Thompson have could help the Democratic Party regain some semblance of an agenda that can resonate with the population. But the promise of a world of abundance as they envision it is fundamentally unattainable, and for many people, it sounds dystopian.\n\nAdvancing an agenda of “rewilded” farmland, lab-grown meat, and “micro earpieces” may play well among the urban elite crowds of Manhattan, Boston, and San Francisco, but try selling that agenda in the Midwestern states that Democrats used to be competitive in. Telling the people of an agriculture-heavy state such as Wisconsin that they need to give up the farms their families built for generations is about the surest way to drive this competitive swing state toward Republicans.\n\nFor some time, a major part of the Left’s political project has been embracing the notion that the perfect civilization is attainable. The entire experiment of communism in Eastern Europe was premised on the idea that the perfect society could be built if private property, religion, and private education were all abolished, replaced by the communal distribution of goods, mandatory public education, and a centralized labor plan.\n\nToday, it takes a slightly different form. If we don’t prosecute criminals and instead treat them with compassion, then they will stop committing crimes. If the government guarantees healthcare for all, then everyone will be healthier. If people had more jobs, they would not engage in criminal activity. None of those things necessarily follow from one another, but that hasn’t stopped policymakers, academics, and activists from preaching that they do.\n\nBut promising a utopia is simply an act of arrogance, born out of the notion that man can master the world he inhabits. The utopia of abundance could come with terrible costs that the authors never envisioned. There has never been and never will be a perfect city or nation. Humanity is too flawed and different to achieve it. This is something Christianity has always recognized. The founders of America recognized it as well, intentionally implementing a system of governance designed to shield against humanity’s flaws.\n\nToday, in the United States, the political Left is in a rough spot. Its vehicle for attaining political power, the Democratic Party, has been rudderless ever since President Donald Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and delivered the first Republican trifecta since 2016. For the past decade, the party defined itself simply as being opposed to Trump and refused to articulate a different vision of what the country should look like. In the meantime, the people voted for Trump and left the Democratic bastions of New York, New Jersey, and California for the Republican-run states of Florida and Texas.\n\nNow, the party is stuck in opposition for another four years, at the end of which Trump will permanently exit the political scene, thus depriving the Democratic Party of its primary unifier. At the same time, the party continues to struggle to appeal to the working-class constituencies that once were a major part of its coalition. The Abundance agenda’s vision may be billed as the way to fix that problem, namely, by fixing the Democratic Party’s problems with competent governance, but it will not solve the party’s problems with voters. \n\nInstead, it will only exacerbate the urban-rural and coastal-heartland divides that have come to exemplify the red-blue map. It’s a political vision by urban elites for a party dominated by urban elites, and it will only resonate with urban elites.","summary":"If you listen to New York Times columnist Ezra Klein describe his new book Abundance, it would seem the entire thesis is that at some point, Democrat-run cities stopped building houses, and if that were reversed, it would solve the party’s problems.

He has made notable media appearances including a notable trip to Real Time with Bill Maher and earlier this year he launched a podcast, This is Gavin Newsom, that has included guests including former top Trump adviser Steve Bannon.What To KnowAn Emerson College Polling/Inside California Politics/The Hill survey published April 17 found that 59 percent of respondents said they don 't think that Newsom should run for president in 2028, with 41 percent supporting a bid for the Oval Office.The poll comes in with strict divide along party lines.While 61 percent of Democratic respondents say they would support a Newsom run, 78 percent of Republicans and 75 percent of independents in the state say the opposite.Newsom's approval rating among respondents is 33 percent overall compared to 42 percent disapproval. Another 24 percent remain neutral.The poll, centered on California's 2026 gubernatorial election, was conducted April 12to April 14, 2025. The sample of approximately 1,000 California registered voters has a has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.Matt Taglia, senior director at Emerson College Polling, told Newsweek the results are not too surprising considering given Newsom's approval/disapproval rating in this poll—which is significantly lower than his 42 percent-40 percent approval/disapproval rating in a February poll from Emerson.\"There's clearly something driving negative sentiment,\" Taglia said. \"President [Donald] Trump has seen a similar decline in job approval between these two California polls as well.\"Other reasons for the shift in voter sentiment, Taglia said, alluding to issues like economics—tariffs—and the California-specific volatility of the housing market. In February, the economy and housing affordability accounted for about 50 percent of California voters' top issues, and has now jumped to 64 percent.Newsom, during an appearance on Maher's show on March 28, called the current Democratic brand \"toxic.\"\"Governor Newsom obviously cannot control all of these factors directly, but with voters looking for someone to blame, he and the president are natural targets,\" Taglia said.He added: \"With all of this in mind, it's no surprise there's limited appetite in California for Newsom as a presidential candidate. That could easily change as his tenure as governor comes to a close, and as the Trump administration continues to push its policy agenda. His response to the administration, and to issues closer to home, will likely drive sentiment towards him in the state.\"The same poll showed Trump's approval rating at 28 percent and disapproval rating at 56 percent.The economy is respondents' biggest concern for 40 percent of California voters, followed by housing affordability—24 percent—and threats to democracy, immigration and crime all tied at 7 percent.What People Are SayingDemocratic Representative Jimmy Gomez of California to Spectrum News: \"He's doing what I think is in the interest of Gavin Newsom and not necessarily in the entire party. We have to organize in our districts and then go to the districts in the areas of the country that we need to win over; that means door to door, text message, phone calls and have those conversations. I just don't think his strategy is necessarily about changing public perception. It's about honestly helping position Gavin to run.\"Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling: \"A majority of Democrats, 77 percent, and half of independent voters see tariffs as more of a tax on the consumer, while 48 percent of Republican voters see them as more of a tax on the foreign country.\"What Happens NextNewsom is term limited and will leave office after the 2026 statewide election. There has been speculation that former Vice President Kamala Harris—the Democratic nominee for president in 2024—could potentially run for the governor's mansion, though she has also been mentioned as a possible 2028 White House contender.","summary":"\"With voters looking for someone to blame, [Newsom] and the president are natural targets,\" an Emerson College pollster told Newsweek.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/gavin-newsom-trump-president-poll-democrats-2061500","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2629775/gavin-newsom.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 16:59:23","author":"Nick Mordowanec","authors":["Nick Mordowanec"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":312513546,"title":"Will Kamala Harris’ win 2026 California governor’s race? Here’s what a new poll reveals","text":"Kamala Harris has yet to confirm whether she will run for governor of California in 2026, but a new poll is already generating buzz. The former vice president has yet to speak out, despite Democratic voters' support and skepticism. Here's what Californians are saying about a potential Harris campaign.While Democratic voters expressed strong support, policymakers and Republicans were more cautious or critical. Harris is still undecided, but her national profile and Democratic base give her an early advantage.Responses to a hypothetical Kamala Harris run for California governor are divided, according to a poll by POLITICO and the Citrin Center at UC Berkeley.How are Democrats and Republicans reacting to her potential run?A recently published survey offers an early indication of how California voters feel about her possible candidacy.Respondents were asked to choose from a list of descriptive words such as joyful, mostly excited, indifferent, irritated, outraged, hopeless, or other to describe their feelings regarding a Harris run. Respondents were permitted to choose more than one choice, as per a report by The Grio.ALSO READ: You thought Donald Trump was unpopular? Here are shocking poll numbers that may surprise you Voters who were registered to vote in California and those deemed policy influencers were the two groups of people surveyed. The findings showed two distinct conclusions regarding the attitudes of California voters toward a prospective governor, Harris.Kamala Harris was met with overwhelming enthusiasm from Democratic voters who were registered to vote. 41% of respondents said they were mostly excited, and 33% said they were happy about Harris' potential run for California's top job, as per a report by The Grio.The number of Democrats who expressed disapproval of Harris entering the race was in the single digits, while another quarter expressed no opinion.It should come as no surprise that the majority of California's registered Republican voters described their feelings as outraged or irritated. However, considering Democrats' substantial lead among California voters, the fervor of Democratic voters indicates that the governorship may be hers.Who else is running for California governor?Former Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Biden Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, California Lieutenant Governor Eleni Kounalakis, and others have already put their names in the hat, despite some worries that Harris would dominate the field if she decides to run. However, Harris received ambivalent support from voters who are regarded as policy influencers. 36 percent of those voters said they were indifferent about Harris' possible run for the position of chief executive of the Golden State.What could Kamala Harris’ future in politics look like?Since Harris was announced as the 2024 Democratic presidential nominee last year, her popularity has soared across the country. In just 107 days, she garnered the third-highest number of votes of any presidential candidate, despite her unsuccessful attempt to deny President Donald Trump a second term in office.Considering the situation, Harris's supporters have praised her 2024 campaign. This is probably the reason Harris hasn't ruled out a 2028 presidential run yet. Harris, who is 60 years old and considered young by political standards, may decide to run for president after 2028.FAQsIs Kamala Harris running for Governor in 2026?She hasn't decided yet, but she plans to make an announcement by late summer.How have voters reacted to the idea?Most Democrats are ecstatic, while most Republicans are opposed. Insiders in the policy world are still unsure.","summary":"A recent poll reveals divided opinions among Californians regarding a potential Kamala Harris run for governor in 2026.

Photos from the scene captured the charred remains of the religious books they’d used that evening. In an affidavit for a search warrant, police said that the assailant had told a 911 operator that he’d targeted Shapiro “for what he wants to do to the Palestinian people.” Balmer later told police that he’d planned to beat the governor with a hammer had he encountered him. He faces eight charges, including attempted homicide.\n\nAttempting to murder an American Jew over the actions of completely different Jews thousands of miles away in the Middle East is textbook anti-Semitism. But in the case of Shapiro, it’s particularly perverse, because the governor supports Palestinian statehood and has been a harsh critic of Israel’s leadership. “I personally believe Benjamin Netanyahu is one of the worst leaders of all time,” he told reporters back in January 2024, months before then–Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called on the Israeli prime minister to resign. Shapiro sharply condemned anti-Semitic protesters on university campuses but distinguished them from non-extremist demonstrators, and defended the prerogative of “young people to righteously protest and question”—a stark contrast to the current administration, which has been deporting foreign students for their speech.\n\nGiven Shapiro’s actual positions, how might someone get the impression that he is somehow responsible for Israel’s actions and in lockstep with its leadership? Most people would not even know, let alone care about, their Rust Belt governor’s position on a foreign conflict. But most governors weren’t the target of a national campaign effectively blaming them for Israel’s conduct. Last summer, when then–Vice President Kamala Harris was choosing her running mate, Shapiro emerged as a top contender, thanks to his robust electoral popularity in an indispensable swing state. And just as quickly, hard-left activists and congressional staffers attempted to pressure Harris not to pick him. “Tell Kamala and the Democrats now: Say no to Genocide Josh Shapiro for Vice President,” declared the site NoGenocideJosh.com.\n\nIn an open democracy, there is nothing wrong with forcefully advocating for Palestinians or against Israel—whatever the Trump administration might say. But there was something very wrong with the Genocide Josh campaign. As political commentators noted at the time, no such campaign was marshaled against any other prospective vice-presidential front-runner, despite all of them having the same—or more hawkish—views on Israel as Shapiro. For example, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, the preferred candidate of many in the anti-Shapiro movement, had a long pro-Israel record dating back to his time in the House of Representatives. As a congressman, he voted to condemn a United Nations resolution against Israeli settlements that President Barack Obama had allowed to pass; called Israel “our truest and closest ally in the region, with a commitment to values of personal freedoms and liberties, surrounded by a pretty tough neighborhood”; and met with Netanyahu personally, releasing a photo to the media of the two of them standing side by side.\n\nAs governor, Walz said of the Gaza campus protests: “I think when Jewish students are telling us they feel unsafe in that, we need to believe them, and I do believe them,” adding that “creating a space where political dissent or political rallying can happen is one thing; intimidation is another.” Some pro-Palestinian activists were arrested after protesting outside his residence. Walz and Shapiro advanced the same position on ending the Gaza war—except that Shapiro said that a solution would “ideally” happen without Netanyahu, whom he called “a destructive force for Israel over time,” whereas Walz never openly criticized the Israeli leader.\n\nNone of this inspired any progressive pushback, presumably because Walz is not Jewish, and so was not seen as inherently suspect and secretly in hock to Israeli interests. Put another way, the Genocide Josh movement singled out a Jewish candidate for censure over Israel while tendentiously misrepresenting his stance on the issues in order to discredit him. This was not an expression of traditional sharp-elbowed American political discourse, but rather an echo of ancient antipathies.\n\nSince the attempted murder of Shapiro, we have learned that his assailant may have suffered from severe mental illness. Balmer’s mother told CBS News that he “went off his medication,” and that her pleas for local police to get him “picked up” the week before had gone unanswered. In the aftermath of such incidents, there is often an unfortunate impulse to stigmatize mental illness as the source of societal prejudice. But those struggling with internal demons don’t originate our external ones; they reflect them. In their confusion and pain, such individuals latch on to those already targeted by the broader culture and its preexisting pathologies, showing us not who they are, but who we are. This is why deeply troubled people—from Kanye West (now known as Ye) to the murderously disturbed—have more often gone after Jewish people than, say, the Amish. Weakened minds tend to be overtaken by strong currents.\n\nCrimes like the one against Shapiro hold up a mirror to our collective biases. In this case, it appears that high-profile deceptions and double standards about a Jewish politician’s Israel stance contributed to an unwell person trying to kill him. The Passover attack is a warning: If we don’t reckon with the lies about Jews in our public sphere, we will see more lies, and more of their consequences.","summary":"An attack on the Pennsylvania governor shows the dangers of tendentious misrepresentations.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/josh-shapiro-attempted-assessination/682503/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8NQVMfByLnYocIQTRe3qCvFWt5Y=/0x175:8243x4468/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/04/2025_04_18_Josh_Shapiro/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 14:10:12","author":"Yair Rosenberg","authors":["Yair Rosenberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.376},{"id":312510552,"title":"Katy Perry gears up for sci-fi inspired world tour","text":"In less than a year, Katy Perry has released an album, campaigned for Vice President Kamala Harris and, just this week, flown to space. As she heads to Mexico City to kick off a world tour on Wednesday, the pop superstar shows no intention of slowing down.\n\n“I’m always open and I say, ‘Why not?’ and ‘Let’s just try,’” she told The Associated Press recently at her Southern California rehearsal space. “The power of your thoughts are so incredible because everything starts with a thought. I had this thought, ‘I want to go on tour.’ And here we are.”\n\nWith that openness to try comes accepting that not every endeavor will be a victory. Her September album, “143,” was critically panned, and she was simultaneously criticized for reuniting with embattled producer Dr. Luke. Celebrities like Olivia Munn and Emily Ratajkowski critiqued the spaceflight’s use of resources as superfluous and indulgent. And Harris ultimately lost the November election to President Donald Trump.\n\nBut Perry’s longevity and the scale of her fame since her 2008 breakout hit, “I Kissed a Girl,” are attributable at least in part to her willingness to get back up in the wake of a setback, as she belts in her 2013 empowerment anthem, “Roar.” \n\n“I can control what I can control,” she said.\n\nThat mantra has been refined over the past 15 years through her practice of Transcendental Meditation. The meditation technique has been embraced by a handful of celebrities, including — perhaps most zealously — the late David Lynch, whom Perry credits with spreading the practice and its message.\n\n“That changed my life. And I’ve gone on a long inner space journey to untangle some wires, to answer some questions, to become more grounded, to find the power within myself,” she said.\n\nPerry is fascinated by all things spiritual, casually weaving into conversation references to astrology, the enneagram and cardology, which purports to impart mystical insights into an individual’s personality through playing cards. Perry also credits having her daughter, Daisy, with propelling her along a journey of self-discovery and enhancing her “feminine divine.”\n\n“Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she said. “I think I’ve just grown into the strong woman that I’ve always dreamed of and idolized.”\n\nThat journey has informed her approach to music and performing, down to the narrative of her sci-fi themed “Lifetimes Tour.” Citing films like “Blade Runner” and “The Fifth Element” as visual and thematic inspirations, Perry will play a video game character who faces off against evil forces.\n\n“It’s really about believing in yourself and leading with love. Those are always my messages, no matter how I wrap it or whatever tour I bring. It’s love and empowerment,” she said. “When I can lead by example, it just ripples.”\n\nPerry’s tour of more than 80 performances will primarily be a career-spanning showcase of past hits, but with a dance-infused flare to some of the traditional pop songs. “I tell everybody they have to wear some sensible shoes,” she explained.\n\nIn the nearly two decades since Perry emerged as a pop star, she has made tongue in cheek lyricism — in line with her “very sarcastic” sense of humor — and catchy messages of empowerment a signature of her songs. Critical reception to her more recent albums has been less than enthusiastic, but that hasn't stopped the 40-year-old from going all out for this tour, calling it “Disneyland on wheels.”\n\n“I feel a responsibility to my audience who have really been with me on this ride during this whole lifetime to give them that feeling that they had when they first heard 'Teenage Dream,'\" she said.","summary":"Katy Perry has been busy","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/kamala-harris-katy-perry-ontario-mexico-city-donald-trump-b2735726.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/18/14/Music-Katy_Perry_56684.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 13:39:19","author":"Krysta Fauria","authors":["Krysta Fauria"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.363},{"id":312475424,"title":"To Broker Or Not To Broker: Team Trump's Ukraine Gamble And A Mood Shift In US","text":"Russia-Ukraine War: Ending the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war was one of US President Donald Trump’s campaign promises, and one that he famously boasted could be achieved in 24 hours. But months after assuming the Presidential office for a second term, the Trump administration barely managed to negotiate a partial ceasefire.\nThe US President at several occasions said that a conclusion to the ongoing efforts could be seen by May. But it seems that Trump’s efforts to end the war are struggling to get off the starting blocks. Despite the Trump administration’s initial confidence that it could secure a ceasefire deal quickly, attempts to reach a full ceasefire have yet to materialise, with Washington blaming both sides.\nRussia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has placed a number of conditions on any potential ceasefire.\nWith the growing frustration, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has now warned that the United States could end its peace efforts on ending the conflict within “days” if there are no signs of progress. “We’re not going to continue with this endeavour for weeks and months on end,” Rubio said, adding that the US had “other priorities to focus on”.\nA Timeline of Key Events\nTrump Vows To End War In 24 Hours\nDuring CNN Townhall in 2023, Trump had asserted to end the ongoing war within 24 hours. “They’re dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I’ll have that done — I’ll have that done in 24 hours,” Trump had said.\nHe had reiterated the claim during his September debate with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, when he emphasised his plan to mediate between Russia and Ukraine. “That is a war that’s dying to be settled. I will get it settled before I even become president. If I win, when I’m president-elect, and what I’ll do is I’ll speak to one, I’ll speak to the other. I’ll get them together,” he had said.\nHowever, after assuming the office, the US President admitted that his repeated campaign promise to end the Russia-Ukraine war within 24 hours, even before taking office, was “a little bit sarcastic.”\nTrump Assumes Presidential Office\nSucceeding Joe Biden, Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th President of the United States as he took the oath of office in a packed US Capitol building on January 20, 2025. While, JD Vance took oath as the Vice President of the country.\nAfter a bitterly polarising and violent campaign where he was targeted in two assassination attempts, Donald Trump earned a decisive victory over Democratic Former VP Kamala Harris, gaining 312 electoral votes to her 226.\nTrump has repeatedly said that if he was the President in 2022, Russia would not have been able to invade Ukraine in 2022. Putin had also claimed that the Ukraine crisis might not have emerged if Trump was the President.\nTrump Holds Talks With Putin\nAfter assuming the office, Trump held “lengthy and highly productive” telephone call with Vladimir Putin on February 12 in which they both had agreed to begin negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.\nIn a readout of the conversation posted on Truth Social, Trump had said, “We discussed Ukraine, the Middle East, Energy, Artificial Intelligence, the power of the Dollar, and various other subjects.”\n“We agreed to work together, very closely, including visiting each other’s Nations. We have also agreed to have our respective teams start negotiations immediately, and we will begin by calling President Zelenskyy, of Ukraine, to inform him of the conversation, something which I will be doing right now,” Trump had said.\n\nBoth Washington and Moscow, in their descriptions of the call, suggested the men assumed a conciliatory tone.\n\nTrump-Zelenskyy Oval Office Showdown\nSigns of Trump’s impatience have erupted periodically since he started pushing for a ceasefire, most notably at the disastrous Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy on March 1.\nDonald Trump, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and US Vice-President JD Vance were locked in a series of tense exchanges at the White House- a week after the Ukrainian President said that his US counterpart was “living in a disinformation space” created by Russia.\nThe Trump administration was to negotiate an agreement with Ukraine that would grant the US access to Ukraine’s minerals in exchange for the support it has provided since the war began in 2022, as part of the peace deal.\nAt the Oval Office, Trump dressed down Zelenskyy and said that the latter is “gambling with World War Three”. The US President chided Zelenskyy as he said that the Ukrainian leader has “tremendous hate” for Russian President Vladimir Putin. “You want me to be tough, I can be tougher than any human being you’ve ever seen… but you’re never going to get a deal that way,” he said.\nFollowing the argument, Washington had suspended military aid to Ukraine as well as intelligence sharing and access to satellite imagery in a bid to force it to the negotiating table.\nUS-Ukraine Meets In Saudi Arabia\nLater American diplomats and their Ukrainian counterparts held two rounds of deliberations in Saudi Arabia in March to discuss measures to halt the Ukraine war, holding discussions on various topics like mineral deal and also a possible resumption of US military aid to Ukraine after the Oval Office Showdown.\nLater Zelenskyy held a telephonic conversation with Trump where the former had agreed to accept the unconditional ceasefire proposal as proposed by the US. The Ukrainian President had said that Kyiv was ready to pause strikes on Russian energy and civilian infrastructure.\nHowever, Putin demurred and said it was a complicated matter.\nAfter Putin’s rejection, top Moscow officials have attempted to shift the blame onto the Ukrainian government and European leaders, claiming that they are desperate to keep fighting and that only Russia is willing to negotiate a peace deal. For a broader peace deal, Russia has insisted on total neutrality for Ukraine, a drastically reduced military, the removal of its current elected government as well as control of the five regions of the country it has illegally annexed (but doesn’t entirely control) .\nHowever, continuous strikes from both the ends irked the United States. Trump lashed out at the leaders of both warring parties in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, expressing frustration as efforts to kick-start ceasefire talks remain deadlocked.\nTrump had first criticised Russian President Vladimir Putin for questioning the credibility of Zelenskyy as a negotiating partner, saying he was “very angry, pissed off” with the Kremlin chief.\nLater, Trump turned his fire on Zelenskyy, saying: “I see he’s trying to back out of the rare earth deal. And if he does that he’s got some problems. Big, big problems. We made a deal on rare earth and now he’s saying, well, you know, I want to renegotiate the deal. He wants to be a member of NATO. Well, he was never going to be a member of NATO. He understands that. So if he’s looking to renegotiate the deal, he’s got big problems.”\nTrump Admin Warns To Abandon Efforts\nRubio said he spoke with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov after the Paris talks and had told him they had been constructive, and also briefed him on “some of the elements of” the US peace framework.\nRubio’s remarks reflected how the US-sponsored peace efforts have stalled and the president’s frustration with the talks has grown. Though Trump said during his campaign he could end the war in Ukraine within 24 hours, he is now almost three months into his second term. The administration’s main achievement to date — an agreement by both sides to pause attacks on energy infrastructure for 30 days — is close to its end and has not stopped deadly attacks in Ukraine.\nThe top US diplomat did not specify what to “move on” would mean for continued U.S. military support for Ukraine or sanctions on Russia. If the United States were to just end its support for peace talks, it would mark a significant win for the Kremlin, which currently has the momentum on the battlefield.\nSoon after Rubio’s comments, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov responded by saying progress had been made, citing the 30-day energy ceasefire, which he then said had expired.\nRussia’s conflict in Ukraine goes back more than a decade, to 2014, when Kyiv’s pro-Russian president was overthrown. Russia then annexed Crimea and backed insurgents in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.\n(With inputs from agencies)","summary":"Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 and has placed a number of conditions on any potential ceasefire.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/to-broker-or-not-to-broker-team-trumps-ukraine-gamble-and-a-mood-shift-in-us-9304547.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/04/NW181600-x-900-px-9-2025-04-5292456fd18c5c93be5ba82863304b41.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 13:32:10","author":"News18,Shobhit Gupta","authors":["News18","Shobhit Gupta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.27},{"id":312509388,"title":"Why do Trump voters have no regrets?

The US is many things at the moment, but stable is not one of them. So, amid all this turmoil, how are all the Donald Trump voters feeling? Has buyer’s remorse set in? Are they starting to wonder whether voting in a convicted felon as president – a man who has declared bankruptcy six times – might not have been the wisest move?\n\nNot according to the polls. Rather, the US appears to be a nation of Édith Piafs: they regret rien. I’m not saying that disillusioned Republicans don’t exist; do enough digging and you can certainly find a few. And journalists have been doing a lot of digging. During Trump’s first term, there was a steady stream of media pieces profiling the regretful Trump voter. The genre has remained popular through the first few months of Trump 2.0. But, according to a much-discussed segment by CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten this week, polling proves that the idea of “regretful” Trump voters is “more of a media creation than anything else”.\n\n“I hear all these stories, all these articles, all the Trump voters, they regret what they did back in 2024. I’m here to tell you, uh-uh. Very few of them regret what they did back in 2024,” Enten said on Wednesday.\n\nEnten was referencing a new poll from the University of Massachusetts Amherst which found that just 2% of Trump voters agreed with the statement “I regret my [2024] vote and would vote differently if I could”. That’s almost half the number (3.5%) of Trump voters who said the same thing in February 2017. Meanwhile, 74% of Trump voters said they feel very confident that they made the right choice.\n\nOf course, polls aren’t always reliable. Indeed, I’m going to be a little cruel and refer you back to an Enten segment from five days before the election, where the data guru looked at three 2024 polling trends that pointed to a potential victory for vice-president Kamala Harris. “If Harris wins the signs were clear as day,” he declared. In short: Mark Twain had the measure of polling when he said “there are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics”.\n\nAsking people whether they regret an important choice they just made is also a loaded question. It’s akin to asking them “are you a complete idiot?” So I would treat these particular polls with a dose of caution: just because people don’t actively admit to regretting their vote, it doesn’t mean that they’re not worried about the direction the country is headed in, or that they’re thrilled about Trump’s performance as president. On the contrary, Trump’s approval rating is dropping and a lot of people are worried about inflation and higher prices. Everyone is feeling some pain right now.\n\nIn a hyper-polarised country, however, what seems to really matter to many voters isn’t how much pain they’re feeling themselves, but whether the other side is suffering more. I could cite various academic papers on the politics of resentment; I could surface endless statistics on the subject. But I think the best summation of Trumpism is a quote from a woman called Crystal Minton from back in 2019, which went viral after being included in a New York Times report. Minton lived in a Florida town that had been ravaged by the double whammy of a hurricane and a Trump administration-instigated government shutdown, and was suffering. “I voted for [Trump], and he’s the one who’s doing this,” Minton complained. “I thought he was going to do good things. He’s not hurting the people he needs to be hurting.”\n\nRight now, however, Trump is hurting the sort of people many of his voters seem to be interested in seeing get hurt. He’s an avenging angel, wreaking vengeance on the elite institutions, scapegoats and bogeymen that the Republican party has spent years blaming for the state of the US. He’s cut funding to all the Ivy League universities he’s called “woke” and declared out of touch with American values. He’s gone after transgender people. And he has rounded up immigrants and protesters, just as he promised he would do.\n\nTrump isn’t just doing every vindictive thing he told his supporters he was going to do: he’s trolling his detractors via nasty memes. He’s rubbing salt in their wounds. There has been what Marcus Maloney, a sociology professor at Coventry University in the UK, called a “4Chanification of American politics”. The White House Valentine’s Day post, for example, was a poem: “Roses are red, violets are blue, come here illegally, and we’ll deport you”. Cutesy font appeared above the floating heads of Trump and his border czar, Tom Homan. And a video last month posted by the White House showed a man being deported while Semisonic’s famous lyrics played in the background: “You don’t have to go home, but you can’t stay here.” The cruelty is very much the point.\n\nWhile Trump may be hurting all the people he said he’d be hurting, there’s plenty of pain to go around. There has been a lot of anger from some of Trump’s backers in Wall Street over the volatility that the president’s tariff policy has injected into the stock market. Some of his billionaire backers, such as the investor Bill Ackman, have been screaming bloody murder. But for a lot of Trump’s backers, the fluctuations of the stock market have no immediate effect on their lives. The top 10% of Americans hold 93% of all stocks. This is what happens when inequality reaches record levels: you get a group of people with nothing to lose, which means they have little to regret. You get people happy to burn the whole system down.\n\nNone of this is to say that Trump voters are immune to remorse. With his tariff plan, he is just getting started. The president may be good at bluster, but even his most diehard supporter are going to realise quite quickly that food prices – which Trump promised to lower on the campaign trail – are not, in fact, going down. When the price of basic goods keep rising, there’s only so long you can keep feeding people obvious lies. Perhaps the Trumpers won’t get quite so much of a dopamine rush from “owning the libs” when they can’t afford to own anything else.\n\n Arwa Mahdawi is a Guardian columnist","summary":"Even amid political chaos and rising prices, what matters most to his supporters is a macabre form of payback and vengeance\n\nThe stock market is plunging, prices are rising, federal workers are getting laid off, students are being snatched off the street by immigration agents.

Here are shocking poll numbers that may surprise you","text":"Despite headlines and speculation, very few Donald Trump supporters seem to be second-guessing their 2024 decision. Despite economic frustrations and a recent drop in approval, President Trump’s voter loyalty remains firm. CNN's polling expert broke down new data that shows how strong Donald Trump's support base remains and what this means for Democrats hoping for a shift. Do Donald Trump voters regret their 2024 choice?Harry Enten, CNN's data expert, has dissected the percentage of regretful Donald Trump voters who say they no longer back the president. According to Harry Enten, new YouGov polling shows that only 2% of Trump voters regret their 2024 choice, as per a report by the Daily Beast.Enten reports that only 1% of Republican voters say they would prefer not to cast a ballot at all, and only 2% say they would alter their vote if a hypothetical rematch between Trump and Kamala Harris were to take place tomorrow.Despite all the talk of buyer's remorse, the data guru claimed that a repeat of the election last November would probably yield the same outcome, citing a recent YouGov poll, as quoted in a report by the Daily Beast.He clarified that, on average, fewer than 5 percent of Trump supporters would even think about switching their vote.Near-identical levels of loyalty among Harris voters were also found in this month's poll, indicating that public opinion hasn't changed significantly in either direction.In the end, despite all of the rhetoric about Donald Trump supporters regretting their vote, the data simply doesn't support it, Enten stated. The statistics indicate that it is a fanciful world if there is a notion that Trump supporters are saying things like, Dude, I wish I had voted for Kamala Harris instead of Donald Trump. For the most part, it doesn't exist, as quoted in a report by the Daily Beast.In response to co-host John Berman's question about the stickiness of Trump voters in comparison to his first term, Enten disclosed that more Republican voters had a more unfavorable opinion of the president at this point in 2017 than they do in 2025.Four percent of Trump supporters said they would change their vote in February 2017, a slightly higher percentage than this time. Historically, some Trump supporters don't regret their vote. In fact, the number is lower this time around than it was the first time, and it is unquestionably lower than the number that emerged in 2020, he stated.Following his disastrous tariff policies, Trump's popularity fell in a similar CBS poll earlier this month, which Enten at the time described as the worst poll that Donald Trump has received in his second term. Is Donald Trump’s unpopularity helping Democrats?The president's approval ratings are currently underwater, with 54% of voters blaming Trump for the current economic slump, as per reports.Enten, however, was quick to note that comparing the popularity of two people yields a different outcome than evaluating them separately and that the president's current unpopularity does not translate into Democratic electoral gains.He also emphasized that Republicans currently hold a rare advantage over Democrats in terms of party recognition, with a recent poll showing a satisfaction level of +2%.Democrats see no significant gains, and Republican party satisfaction has slightly increased since the previous election.FAQsAre many Donald Trump supporters regretting their 2024 vote?Not really; only about 2% say they'd change their vote, according to recent polling.Does Donald Trump's current unpopularity benefit the Democrats?Surprisingly, no. Despite low approval, polls indicate no significant shift toward Democrats.","summary":"Despite economic concerns and disapproval ratings, data indicates minimal regret among Donald Trump's 2024 voters, with only 2% expressing a desire to change their vote. This loyalty mirrors that of Kamala Harris's voters, suggesting stable public opinion.

Round one to Harvard!\n\nThe terms in which the US president picked this fight, though, suggests that he was itching to start it even against such heavyweight competition. The five-page screed that the Trump administration sent late on Friday night to Harvard’s president, Alan Garber, made demands that would have been virtually impossible for any self-respecting academic leader to accept.\n\nThey included federal government oversight of admissions and an end to recruitment of international students “hostile to American values” – whatever that meant. Most egregiously, the administration insisted on imposing “viewpoint diversity”, essentially ideological control, over faculty appointments.\n\nHarvard, which had previously made conciliatory gestures in the face of Trump’s accusations of campus antisemitism, finally stepped into the ring on Monday.\n\nIn a message titled The Promise of American Higher Education, Garber bluntly rejected the demands and stated that Harvard would “not surrender its independence or relinquish its constitutional rights”.\n\nLet the fight begin! The awe-inspiring might of the federal government is now pitted against the intellectual and institutional might of the US’s most revered university.\n\nRelated: How Harvard’s pushback against Trump may embolden more US resistance\n\nThere is much riding on the outcome. Harvard has already been punished with $2.3bn in frozen federal funds this week, and Trump is threatening to terminate the full $9bn in US government subsidies and take away its tax exempt status. Those would be savage blows, even with such a hefty endowment.\n\nThe stakes are even higher for other, less financially padded, institutions. Harvard may be too big to fail, but others are not.\n\nThe education department has put at least 60 universities on notice that they will be investigated under the guise of alleged campus antisemitism. According to the New York Times, top White House aides including Trump’s powerful policy guru, Stephen Miller, have talked privately about “toppling” a high-profile university to set a chilling example.\n\n“These attacks are not a minor disagreement over policy,” Ryan Enos, a political scientist and professor of government at Harvard, said. “They are an authoritarian attack on higher education.”\n\nEnos was co-author last month of a letter urging the university to resist, which was signed by more than 800 faculty. The letter landed at a tense time in which Harvard looked poised to capitulate to Trump’s demands, as Columbia University had done.\n\nHarvard authorities had forced out the leaders of the Center for Middle Eastern Studies in a move which Enos and many other faculty members interpreted as a “clear violation of academic freedom”. When the university authorities finally took a stand on Monday, the relief was palpable.\n\nNow that the battle has been joined, and with the potential survival of some universities in the balance, the onus is on Harvard to take on Trump, and win. Enos noted that it’s critical that Harvard stands strong in the face of government intimidation.\n\n“Harvard cannot lose track of its own values. They must not do the Trump administration’s work for it, even when the pressure is intense,” he said.\n\nOne thing is clear: if Harvard, armor-plated by its history and logistically bolstered by its endowment, cannot resist this onslaught, then nobody can. Yet it won’t be easy.\n\nThe US is littered with the battered remains of Trump’s defeated rivals, from a legion of moderate Republicans, through top Democrats such as Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, to even federal prosecutors who tried to nail him and largely failed.\n\nRelated: Obama backs Harvard as Yale faculty members support standing up to Trump\n\nWhat can Harvard do differently that Trump’s earlier victims could not? Some of the strategy will be channeled through litigation and the courts.\n\nIn his message on Monday, Garber alluded to possible legal action challenging Trump for violating the university’s first amendment right to free speech. He also laid the groundwork for a lawsuit accusing the administration of exceeding its powers under title VI of the 1964 civil rights act which prohibits race discrimination in programs supported by federal funding.\n\nAs a second channel, Harvard intends to lobby Republican politicians hard on Capitol Hill. It has employed the Trump-friendly firm Ballard Partners, a lobbying company whose founder, Brian Ballard, was Trump’s Florida finance chair in 2016.\n\nBut where the fight is likely to be most hotly contested – and may well be lost or won – is in the battle for American hearts and minds.\n\n“What matters above all is the relationship between America’s colleges and the American people,” said Danielle Allen, who directs the Allen Lab for Democracy Renovation at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nAllen has already felt the sting of Trump’s attacks. A program she runs promoting civic education in schools had its $6m grant from the Pentagon pulled by Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn effort, Doge; she is now having to reconfigure the work on a much smaller footprint.\n\nAllen would like to see Harvard seize this moment to forge what she called in a recent Atlantic article a new social contract with the American people. She proposes a campaign on the part of all US universities to thank the American people for their support.\n\n“We haven’t said thank you enough, and that’s what we should be doing across the country. It’s time for a comprehensive statement of thanks to the American people from American higher education,” she said.\n\nHarvard has moved swiftly to address public support, but from the opposite direction. Rather than thanking the people, it is seeking to show them why they should thank it.\n\nThe university has recast its website with an audacious rebuttal to Trump’s slurs, showcasing some of Harvard’s most stunning achievements – with a heavy accent on medical breakthroughs that have transformed countless lives: new treatment for sickle cell patients, new ways of looking at autism, groundbreaking research on cancer, Parkinson’s disease and hearing loss.\n\nThe website goes on to brag about jaw-dropping innovations: the first US graduate program in business administration, 1908; the first organ transplant, 1954; the first quantum computing processor, 2023.\n\nRelated: IRS reportedly planning to revoke Harvard’s tax-exempt status\n\nOn a lighter note, Harvard presented its secret weapon by throwing Elmo into the UFC ring. Yes, Sesame Street emerged in 1969 from the Harvard graduate school of education.\n\nNot to mention that a Harvard chemist in 1854 invented baking powder. Or that, in a wry nod to Trump’s obsession, in 1899 a Harvard dentist created the first golf tee (Trump won’t like this, but the inventor, George Franklin Grant, was Black).\n\n“They are saying that Harvard research is a part of our daily lives, that it is relatable to the average person,” said Teresa Valerio Parrott, principal at a higher education consulting agency TVP Communications.\n\n“Every college and university across the country has stories like this, and can now emulate what Harvard is doing.”\n\nIt all makes for powerful messaging. But then, it is hard to match Trump’s counter-messaging for its sheer punch. Where Harvard has gone high, the president, true to form, is going very, very low.\n\nHe has called the university a “joke”, accused it of teaching “hate and stupidity”, and claimed it supports terrorism and what he called, puzzlingly, “sickness”.\n\nThe potency of this is not only that he is pumping it out to his almost 10 million Truth Social followers, or that it is being amplified by the media to the 77 million people who voted for him in November. His stream of invective is also exploiting a vulnerability that for years has troubled Harvard and other prestigious universities – their disconnect with public sympathies.\n\nConfidence in US higher education has been on a steady decline in the past decade. Gallup polls have traced the fall, from 57% who had a great deal of confidence in it in 2015, to just 36% in 2024.\n\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that in the same timespan the cost of a private college or university education has risen astronomically. Next academic year, Harvard undergraduates will pay close to $90,000 per year for tuition and living costs.\n\nThat has left top schools accessible to super wealthy students on the one hand, and paradoxically on the other to lower-income students who can benefit from full rides. But it leaves the vast middle swathe of Americans in the lurch.\n\nRelated: US universities’ faculty unite to defend academic freedom after Trump’s attacks\n\nAllen said that this mounting crisis had been known for a quarter of a century, and yet the solution remains elusive.\n\n“We’ve tried to take whacks at that through financial aid, but it hasn’t addressed the needs of the middle class,” she said, adding that it was time to think out of the box. As a starter, she suggested three- instead of four-year courses, on the UK model.\n\nThe conundrum is that these structural problems run deep and will take time to fix – the one thing you don’t have in the UFC ring is time.\n\nAs round two opens, Trump is certain to double down on his denigration of Harvard as a woke liberal bastion detached from the American people. No matter that he and his henchmen are all beneficiaries of the very elite education they now deride: Trump at the University of Pennsylvania, his vice-president JD Vance at Yale, Miller at the “Harvard of the South”, Duke University.\n\nHarvard must act quickly and nimbly to hit back. For Enos, that means striking Trump at his core.\n\n“When authoritarians attack free speech at a university, they are attacking the very system that undergirds freedom in the United States,” he said.\n\n“That is something that all Americans, regardless of political view, should reject.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/harvard-armor-plated-history-padded-120008113.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/6c816dd5a99656735ba9d20f6c30e3f0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 12:00:08","author":"Ed Pilkington","authors":["Ed Pilkington"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.04},{"id":312509426,"title":"If Harvard, armor-plated by history and padded with funds, can’t beat Trump, no one can","text":"Donald Trump attended the first Ultimate Fighting Championship event of his new presidency on Saturday, reveling off stage in a standing ovation from Maga supporters and on stage in the barely controlled violence of a sport he has long adored.\n\nThe previous day he instigated his own UFC bout, picking a fight with one of the US’s most formidable opponents: Harvard is not only the world’s richest university, with a $53bn endowment that is bigger than the GDP of almost 100 countries, it is also the oldest in the US.\n\nIt was founded in 1636, which makes it 140 years older than the United States itself.

He also laid the groundwork for a lawsuit accusing the administration of exceeding its powers under title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits race discrimination in programs supported by federal funding.\n\nAs a second channel, Harvard intends to lobby Republican politicians hard on Capitol Hill. It has employed the Trump-friendly firm Ballard Partners, a lobbying company whose founder, Brian Ballard, was Trump’s Florida finance chair in 2016.\n\nBut where the fight is likely to be most hotly contested – and may well be lost or won – is in the battle for American hearts and minds.\n\n“What matters above all is the relationship between America’s colleges and the American people,” said Danielle Allen, who directs the Allen Lab for Democracy Renovation at the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nAllen has already felt the sting of Trump’s attacks. A program she runs promoting civic education in schools had its $6m grant from the Pentagon pulled by Elon Musk’s slash-and-burn effort, the so-called “department of government efficiency”; she is now having to reconfigure the work on a much smaller footprint.\n\nAllen would like to see Harvard seize this moment to forge what she called in a recent Atlantic article a new social contract with the American people. She proposes a campaign on the part of all US universities to thank the American people for their support.\n\n“We haven’t said thank you enough, and that’s what we should be doing across the country. It’s time for a comprehensive statement of thanks to the American people from American higher education,” she said.\n\nHarvard has moved swiftly to address public support, but from the opposite direction. Rather than thanking the people, it is seeking to show them why they should thank it.\n\nThe university has recast its website with an audacious rebuttal to Trump’s slurs, showcasing some of Harvard’s most stunning achievements – with a heavy accent on medical breakthroughs that have transformed countless lives: new treatment for sickle cell patients, new ways of looking at autism, groundbreaking research on cancer, Parkinson’s disease and hearing loss.\n\nThe website goes on to brag about jaw-dropping innovations: the first US graduate program in business administration, 1908; the first organ transplant, 1954; the first quantum computing processor, 2023.\n\nOn a lighter note, Harvard presented its secret weapon by throwing Elmo into the UFC ring. Yes, Sesame Street emerged in 1969 from the Harvard graduate school of education.\n\nNot to mention that a Harvard chemist in 1854 invented baking powder. Or that, in a wry nod to Trump’s obsession, in 1899 a Harvard dentist created the first golf tee (Trump won’t like this, but the inventor, George Franklin Grant, was Black).\n\n“They are saying that Harvard research is a part of our daily lives, that it is relatable to the average person,” said Teresa Valerio Parrot, principal at the higher education consulting agency TVP Communications.\n\n“Every college and university across the country has stories like this, and can now emulate what Harvard is doing.”\n\nIt all makes for powerful messaging. But then, it is hard to match Trump’s counter-messaging for its sheer punch. Where Harvard has gone high, the president, true to form, is going very, very low.\n\nHe has called the university a “joke”, accused it of teaching “hate and stupidity”, and claimed it supports terrorism and what he called, puzzlingly, “sickness”.\n\nThe potency of this is not only that he is pumping it out to his almost 10 million Truth Social followers, or that it is being amplified by the media to the 77 million people who voted for him in November. His stream of invective is also exploiting a vulnerability that for years has troubled Harvard and other prestigious universities – their disconnect with public sympathies.\n\nConfidence in US higher education has been on a steady decline in the past decade. Gallup polls have traced the fall, from 57% who had a great deal of confidence in it in 2015, to just 36% in 2024.\n\nIt is perhaps no coincidence that in the same timespan the cost of a private college or university education has risen astronomically. Next academic year, Harvard undergraduates will pay close to $90,000 a year for tuition and living costs.\n\nThat has left top schools accessible to super wealthy students on the one hand, and paradoxically on the other to lower-income students who can benefit from full rides. But it leaves the vast middle swathe of Americans in the lurch.\n\nAllen said that this mounting crisis had been known for a quarter of a century, and yet the solution remains elusive.\n\n“We’ve tried to take whacks at that through financial aid, but it hasn’t addressed the needs of the middle class,” she said, adding that it was time to think out of the box. As a starter, she suggested three- instead of four-year courses, on the UK model.\n\nHarvard must have had a premonition of the storm that was about to hit it. Two months into the new Trump presidency it went some way to address its funding dilemma by announcing that students whose families earn $200,000 or less would go tuition-free, while students whose families make less than $100,000 would pay nothing, including living costs.\n\nThat was a solid first step towards closing the gap between public expectations and institutional reputation. The conundrum is that these structural problems run deep and to fix them entirely will take time – the one thing you don’t have in the UFC ring is time.\n\nAs round two opens, Trump is certain to double down on his denigration of Harvard as a woke liberal bastion detached from the American people. No matter that he and his henchmen are all beneficiaries of the very elite education they now deride: Trump at the University of Pennsylvania, his vice-president, JD Vance, at Yale, Miller at the “Harvard of the south”, Duke University.\n\nHarvard must act quickly and nimbly to hit back. For Enos, that means striking Trump at his core.\n\n“When authoritarians attack free speech at a university, they are attacking the very system that undergirds freedom in the United States,” he said.\n\n“That is something that all Americans, regardless of political view, should reject.”","summary":"The awe-inspiring might of the government is pitted against the might of the revered US university: let the fight begin\n\nDonald Trump attended the first Ultimate Fighting Championship event of his new presidency on Saturday, reveling off stage in a standing ovation from Maga supporters and on stage in the barely controlled violence of a sport he has long adored.\n\nThe previous day he instigated his own UFC bout, picking a fight with one of the US’s most formidable opponents: Harvard is not only the world’s richest university, with a $53bn endowment that is bigger than the GDP of almost 100 countries, it is also the oldest in the US.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/apr/18/trump-harvard-university-endowment","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c48726912d82c7e99c7e84acdd9ae148e377e27/1_0_2998_1800/master/2998.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmY","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 12:00:08","author":"Ed Pilkington","authors":["Ed Pilkington"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":312451890,"title":"Transgender Activists Insist ‘Science Is on Our Side’","text":"Liberals love to claim conservatives don’t have a firm grip on “reality,” but they also insist reality has a liberal bias—“facts” and “science” are always on their side.\n\nIn the last election, voters responded to advertisements pointing out that then-Vice President Kamala Harris was firmly committed to using taxpayer money to pay for gender-bending amputations, including for prisoners. MSNBC host Katie Phang calls this kind of advocacy a “war on transgender Americans.” By that logic, MSNBC is endlessly waging a “war on conservative Americans.”\n\nOn April 12, one of the final episodes of “The Katie Phang Show” championed the gender-bending Left. Her guest was trans woman activist Charlotte Clymer. After they exclaimed their mutual admiration, Phang attacked Republicans: “They love to fearmonger. That’s their currency. It galvanizes people to vote based on fear, not on facts. I always like to say, don’t vote on feelings, vote on facts.”\n\nBiological facts are not what the transgender activists are using. They mangle all the facts. But Clymer doubled down: “It’s very easy to fight back on trans issues. The science is on our side.”\n\nThis is a “Pants on Fire” lie, with a glaring exception. The transgender lobby has captured the medical groups, who have joined them in science-mangling advocacy. So Clymer bragged: “Every credible medical organization has come out and endorsed gender-affirming care and said that the trans military ban is ridiculous and unnecessary. They’ve said trans women should be housed in women’s prisons.”\n\nThese are more political positions than medical positions. But you can easily search and find the American Medical Association has filed a legal brief supporting the Kamala Harris position on “gender-affirming care” for prison inmates. They line right up with advocacy groups like Health Professionals Advancing LGBTQ Equality, and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health.\n\nThe opposing view is that taxpayer money shouldn’t be spent on gender-denying amputations for convicted criminals. That’s also a political position, and not a medical opinion.\n\nClymer piled praise on Democrat governors like JB Pritzker of Illinois, Andy Beshear of Kentucky, and especially Janet Mills of Maine, who’s fighting for the right of boys to dominate girls’ sports. MSNBC hosts won’t accuse them of “waging war on female athletes.”\n\nBut congressional Democrats are allegedly AWOL. “Only one party is really talking about trans issues. It’s the Republican Party,” Clymer said. “They’ve made trans issues one of their central topics in campaigning and the national discourse. The more the Democrats ignore this, the more it’s going to come back to haunt us in future elections. Republicans are not going to let up on this.”\n\nThis is what MSNBC does, pressure Democrats from the Left. The headline on MSNBC.com was “Let us live.” No one is taking the opposing position to that. These leftists aren’t “live and let live.” They insist you must celebrate their choices at all times, and use whatever names and pronouns they have designated for themselves. The actual opposing view is “please stop making your pronoun demands and taking our money and proclaiming you’re so oppressed.”\n\nIt’s the Republicans who are taking the side of Facts and Science when it comes to the immutable reality of the gender binary. They are taking that side despite the intimidation of “educated” elites gaslighting the culture with their “allyship” for marginalized minorities. They are the ones who dare to proclaim that God made two genders, and the gender “assigned at birth” is never God’s mistake.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The concept was once unthinkable in the GOP, yet many Republicans are signaling that the party might just break the first commandment of conservative politics.\n\nNorquist’s opinion used to matter in the Republican Party. Maybe it still does. Before President Donald Trump came along, Norquist was the nation’s most powerful enforcer of GOP orthodoxy, at least when it came to taxes. He is the keeper of the Pledge—the written vow taken by a large majority of Republican officeholders in state and federal government to never back a tax increase. For decades, whenever a GOP member of Congress so much as flirted with the idea, Norquist was there to remind them—and voters—of their promise, and the threat of electoral defeat if they broke it.\n\nIn Norquist’s telling, the Pledge has had a perfect record over the past 35 years. “In the House or the Senate, no Republican has voted for a rate increase since 1990,” he told me, referring to the year George H. W. Bush signed a bipartisan budget deal that reneged on his promise to eschew new taxes. But Trump, not Norquist, is now the heavy in GOP politics, and the president has discarded one Ronald Reagan–era shibboleth after another in his second term. Earlier this month, Trump reportedly told Republican senators that he’s open to the idea of letting taxes go up on the wealthy, in part to offset cuts for working-class Americans. Meanwhile, Trump’s tariffs, which the president has framed as a way to restore blue-collar manufacturing jobs, have perturbed the GOP’s free-traders, including Norquist, who for years has denounced tariffs as a levy on consumers.\n\nMore than in his first term, Trump seems open to proposals that match his populist rhetoric. “The reality is that the constituency and base of the Republican Party is shifting,” the GOP economist Oren Cass told me, “and there is rightly and deservedly much more focus on the concerns of working families and much less on what corporations and the highest-income households want.” He added, “We are definitely in a new world.”\n\nCass, a former adviser to Mitt Romney who founded the think tank American Compass, has denounced the GOP’s commitment to lower taxes no matter the fiscal or political cost, making himself a bête noire of Norquist’s. Their dispute is intensifying as Republicans in Congress negotiate legislation to extend Trump’s first-term cuts, which are set to expire at the end of the year. “As a matter of good economic policy, tax cuts are not getting the job done, and they haven’t for some time,” Cass said. Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act slashed rates across the board; the highest earners saw their income rate fall from 39.6 to 37 percent. “These were incredibly expensive,” Cass said. “They certainly do not pay for themselves, and they do not provide the sort of investment incentives and, therefore, growth that their supporters want them to have.”\n\nTo Norquist, Cass’s critique is blasphemy. Raising taxes on the rich, he told me, is for Democrats. And, as Norquist was quick to note, Trump has repeatedly promised to make permanent his 2017 tax cuts, including those for the top income bracket. “The president campaigned on not doing this. The lady running against him campaigned on doing this,” Norquist said. “I don’t think that Trump is going to adopt Kamala Harris’s policies at this point.”\n\nGOP leaders in Congress don’t love the proposal either, but they haven’t ruled it out. The party is struggling with the enormous cost of extending the tax cuts—which would add about $5 trillion to federal deficits over the next decade—while also fulfilling Trump’s promises to erase taxes on tips, overtime work, and seniors’ Social Security benefits. Some in the party don’t want to pay for any of it and have proposed just adding the tally to the nation’s already enormous tab. Cass called that idea “pathetic, embarrassing, and outright cheating.” He and other conservatives would rather cover the cost by reducing spending, but even the most aggressive proposals would cover only a fraction of the tax cuts.\n\nThat’s where soaking the rich comes in. Late last month, a senior White House official told Axios that the administration was considering a hike on top earners to offset the cost of eliminating taxes on tips. And in the House, Republicans are reportedly drafting a proposal that would create a separate income bracket for millionaires. Either plan would make Trump’s “one big beautiful bill” at least slightly more palatable to the GOP’s deficit hawks, and they could help Republicans blunt accusations from Democrats that they are the party of billionaires and big business.\n\nThat these ideas are even being considered seems to represent a significant concession by some top Republicans: At least for now, Democrats have won the argument over taxing the rich. Polls have repeatedly found strong public support for raising taxes on the wealthy and on corporations. Even Norquist framed his opposition not as a defense of the rich but as a way to protect small-business owners, many of whom file taxes as individuals. “It is a declaration of war on Main Street, not Wall Street,” he said. “The idiot staffers at the White House don’t know any economics. They think that only high-income individuals pay that rate.”\n\nNorquist blames the GOP’s swerve in part on Cass, who Norquist said has talked privately about advising Vice President J. D. Vance. (“I don’t comment on private conversations with policy makers at any level in either party,” Cass told me.)\n\nSteve Bannon, the first-term Trump strategist, has also publicly advocated for raising taxes on the wealthy. “At some point, you have to make changes,” Bannon told me, “and those changes are to not extend the tax cuts for the upper bracket.” He said that because major spending cuts “are not on the horizon,” raising taxes is the only way to accomplish the Trump administration’s goal of reducing the deficit. “Grover Norquist and that crowd are lazy, and they’re arrogant,” Bannon said, “and they refuse to look at the reality of the situation we’re in.”\n\nNorquist, for his part, thinks that Bannon is jeopardizing Trump’s legacy. For years, Norquist has cited the first President Bush’s about-face on tax hikes—Bush had pledged, “Read my lips: No new taxes” as a candidate—as a cautionary tale for Republicans. “His tombstone doesn’t say, Won Cold War. It says, Lied and Raised Taxes,” Norquist told me. Trump, he said, won’t “allow Mr. Bannon to stick that on him like a tattoo.” (As it happens, Bush’s tombstone doesn’t have an epitaph, but his New York Times obituary describes his role in ending the Cold War well before it notes that he increased taxes.) Bannon wasn’t particularly worried: “The times are totally different. What century is he living in?” he said. “His tax pledge is irrelevant. He doesn’t move anything in this city.”\n\nLike Trump, Norquist has a tendency to exaggerate. Although it’s true that Republicans have not expressly voted to raise taxes in decades, dozens of GOP lawmakers backed legislation in 2013 that allowed taxes to go up for individuals earning more than $400,000 a year. That deal, however, emerged from negotiations with a Democratic president, Barack Obama; Republicans are now considering a similar policy when they control the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nTrump 2.0 has not been all bad for Norquist. The man most famous for saying that he wanted to make the government small enough to “drown it in the bathtub” has seen Trump slash the federal bureaucracy faster than any president in history. But reducing spending has never animated Norquist as much as cutting taxes. The coming months will test his assumptions about the political risk of raising them, and determine whether he retains enough clout to deter Republicans. “This is not going to happen,” he assured me. “I’m talking to everybody.” Before and after my conversation with Norquist, his spokesperson pointed me to statements from Newt Gingrich, Larry Kudlow, a coalition of 90 trade associations, and others opposing a tax hike.\n\nBut Norquist knows that the Republican whose opinion matters most is Trump. If the president wants to shift the party’s position on taxes, as he has on tariffs, Norquist will likely be powerless to stop him. To that end, he wouldn’t say whether he and the organization he founded, Americans for Tax Reform, would lobby against a bill that includes a rate increase for the wealthy. When I asked whether he could get Republicans in Congress to oppose Trump if he pushed the idea, Norquist was similarly equivocal. “I don’t think it comes to that,” he replied. I couldn’t tell whether he was making a prediction or a wish.","summary":"Is the GOP about to raise taxes?","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/norquist-trump-tax-wealthy/682493/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/m3auAYOxV7iOMqXtCnBDpVbBU6g=/0x3:2696x1407/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/04/2025_04_17_grover_az/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 11:30:00","author":"Russell Berman","authors":["Russell Berman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":312424362,"title":"The Controversy That Said It All About America Under Trump—and Where We’re Headed Now","text":"This is part of Egg, an attempt to explain why Americans have absolutely lost their minds over egg prices.\n\nOur long national egg nightmare may soon be over—but other inflation freakouts are likely just getting started. What can the humble but recently quite expensive egg tell us about what lies ahead?\n\nRight now, prices for eggs on grocery store shelves are still very high. But that shouldn’t last much longer: The USDA-tracked average wholesale price for a dozen standard eggs has fallen from $8 as of early March to around $3 in the most recent data. (The reason for the drop is that there’s been a sharp decline in the number of chickens affected by avian flu.) This should result in falling prices at the retail level within “several weeks,” egg economists (egg-conomists, haha) say.\n\nThat means politicians, members of the press, and consumers may soon need to find a new symbol of rising costs. With 10 percent base tariffs imposed on most imported goods, and even larger duties levied on imports from the U.S.’s three largest trading partners, there should be a lot of rising costs to go around. Cars and smartphones with Canadian and Chinese supply chains could be the subject of well-publicized sticker shock; the same goes for Mexican-origin groceries like avocados, strawberries, and Modelo. A lot of generic prescription drugs are made abroad, too, and there’s no “kitchen table” issue more basic than grandma’s freakin’ pills.\n\nWhatever replaces it, the egg’s reign as the totemically expensive consumer product—mentioned even more often by politicians and ticked-off voters in recent years than the cost of a gallon of gas—was a lengthy and consequential one. The price of a carton rose by about 20 percent over the course of 2021, and bird flu caused it to more than double in 2022. That was perfect timing for Republicans, whose midterm election strategy was to blame Democrats’ COVID stimulus bill for creating “Bidenflation.” (Whether that was a fair allegation is a touchy subject even among Dems, but suffice it to say inflation, at the least, had other causes too.)\n\nThe next two years were a full-on Age of the Political Egg, with the dairy-aisle item receiving, per the Nexis database, mentions in something like 400 separate Fox News segments. Joe Biden, God bless him, somehow ended up bringing up the cost of eggs before Donald Trump did during their ill-fated June 2024 debate. During the Trump–Kamala Harris debate, Trump seemed to suggest—in the not-quite-right way in which he often discusses normal-people stuff—that eggs, bacon, and cereal had become unattainably expensive. (He later said he would bring down the price of groceries, somehow, with tariffs, contrasting this with Harris’ alleged plan to impose “communist price controls.”) Touring a grocery store in Reading, Pennsylvania, in September, J.D. Vance hit his usual mark—would-be humor that lands in the dead stillness of the uncanny valley—by telling onlookers that his two young sons ate a combined 14 eggs each morning.\n\nDemocrats like Harris, on their heels, tried to frame the costs of eggs and other groceries as a matter of corporate profiteering—with some justification, it turns out—to little avail. When Harris lost, it was widely agreed that inflation, as represented by eggs, had been the biggest reason why. And while voters’ judgments about who was at fault may have been questionable, it’s hard to blame them for being alarmed given that, for four decades prior, these kinds of price surges and shortages were mostly unheard of. A $10 carton of eggs was something from crazy world, the kind of thing that happened in other countries. Biden had been elected to restore national stability. (To put things back together again, if you will.) In the average voter’s perception, his failure to prevent further disruptions to basic routines was evidence of a fundamental weakness.\n\n“I find it interesting how press articles often covered small, locally owned, literal mom-and-pop diners that were struggling to offer the inexpensive breakfast plates for which they’re known and beloved,” said Emily Contois, a professor at the University of Tulsa who studies the relationship between food and culture. “Diners play an outsized, patriotic role on the campaign trail as they cultivate a sense of working-class authenticity. So this wasn’t just the concern that eggs were expensive and changing what we could cook and eat at home, but also how egg prices were altering these broader food rituals that tap into national identity.”\n\nDuring COVID, she told me, Trump went to dangerous lengths to maintain the supply of meat—an even more resonant protein—to American consumers. “I can’t help but see a corollary to how Trump thought it was so important during his first administration to keep meat fully stocked in grocery stores,” she said. “Meat symbolizes what it means to eat well for many Americans. Meatpacking is such dangerous work even under typical circumstances, let alone during a pandemic, but these workers were deemed essential because meat is essential to how many Americans conceive of themselves.”\n\nBut the story didn’t end with the election—because then Trump was president again, and eggs were still expensive. So just like that, Democrats loved to talk about groceries. The reason for high egg prices was still bird flu, not presidential policy—but in politics, turnabout is fair play, and Trump certainly didn’t give the impression he was making the matter a priority. In fact, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team accidentally fired members of the Department of Agriculture’s avian-flu staff in February before quickly bringing them back. (The USDA did announce a new billion-dollar bird-flu mitigation program in February.)\n\nThe subject of eggs also gave Democrats an excuse to put off figuring out how to address their party’s deeper issues, or how to make swing voters care about Trump and Musk’s efforts to nullify the Constitution and create a MAGA police state. Given the choice between issuing a press release about egg prices and confronting your simultaneous unpopularity with both your traditional working-class base and your new white-collar professional base … for many Democrats, it isn’t a tough call.\n\nThe response to tariff-induced inflation will likely follow the egg’s path. The opposition party will delight in being able to tell a simple story about destructive incompetence, one that resonates even with voters who only get their news by accident from TikTok dance videos; the party in power will try to change the subject, ineffectually. And if Democrats are lucky and dogged enough, eventually they will be back in charge, and will then have the privilege of being blamed when the prices of Modelo, Advil, and the Ford Mustang don’t come down fast enough. Like a chick breaking through a shell, the cycle just keeps on repeating itself.","summary":"What was egg?","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/04/donald-trump-elon-musk-news-eggs-bird-flu.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/333f9a70-b553-4129-80fe-3b7451bbfdbb.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-18 09:40:00","author":"Ben Mathis-Lilley","authors":["Ben Mathis-Lilley"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":312479134,"title":"The Anti-Immigration Majority Is a Mirage","text":"The Gallup poll on whether Americans think immigration should be increased or decreased shows a curious pattern.

And Trump’s xenophobic stance seemingly paid off even among Latinos who would be targets of his mass deportation agenda—he was the first Republican to win the Rio Grande Valley, which is chock-full of mixed-status families, since 1912. Post-election reporting saw many anecdotes of unauthorized immigrants themselves saying they would have voted for Trump, because surely he wouldn’t deport hardworking people like themselves.\n\nBut now, that support is fading fast. More recent polls show the priority of immigration plummeting, and majority disapproval for Trump on the issue. In the most recent YouGov/Economist poll, he is now 11 points underwater, down 16 points since he was inaugurated. Among Latinos, he is now 46 points underwater.\n\nI think it is reasonably clear what is going on here. Republicans have a highly effective propaganda apparatus that, with the decline of mainstream journalism and the rise of social media, is more effective than ever. Under the Obama and Biden administrations, conservatives successfully whipped up a xenophobic anti-immigrant frenzy with a torrent of outrageous lies, against a background of perceived crisis at the border. But as soon as Trump takes power and makes actual decisions rather than just spreading misinformation, the public gets a whiff of what Republican anti-immigrant policy looks like in practice, and they don’t like it. It turns out that few people thought they were voting for the president to kidnap a legal resident by mistake, deport him to a torture prison in a foreign country, and openly defy a Supreme Court order to bring him back.\n\nUntil someone, be it progressives or centrists, can build a media apparatus to counter right-wing agitprop and make a case for humane immigration policy, this cycle is likely going to repeat.\n\nTrump’s totalitarian assault on the civil rights of immigrants is awful, but also an opportunity.\n\nPresidents Obama and Biden attempted to address immigration through policy appeasement. Obama escalated deportations, eventually reaching a rate about twice that of George W. Bush’s first term. The idea was that if congressional Republicans were bought off, they would agree to legal reform of the immigration system, which was (and is) a badly understaffed, Kafkaesque nightmare. It did not work; a reform bill was blocked by House Republicans despite passing the Senate, and Obama backed off and set up DACA protections for people who had immigrated as children.\n\nBiden, as my colleague Paul Starr writes, had a more balanced approach. He faced a large increase in asylum seekers thanks to pent-up migration from the pandemic, as well as climate change and economic collapse in Venezuela. He tightened up border security and also deported a lot of people, but he also expanded and streamlined the asylum system, roughly tripling the number of asylum grants.\n\nBut as Starr demonstrates, neither Biden, nor Obama, nor Kamala Harris, nor anyone else capable of reaching a mass public has consistently made the case for immigration. Instead, seeing how Republicans have made electoral hay out of the issue—particularly with Trump’s inroads among border-state Latinos—Democrats largely gave up and accepted the restrictionist frame. This likely only helped Trump, as if voters are convinced that immigration is some huge crisis, they’ll tend to opt for full-strength xenophobia rather than a diet version.\n\nTrump’s totalitarian assault on the civil rights of immigrants is awful, but also an opportunity. He is now publicly mulling the possibility of zero-due-process deportations of American citizens to El Salvador’s torture prison. That is where Republican anti-immigrant xenophobia cashes out: first with legal immigrants being black-bagged on the street for writing an op-ed some racist didn’t like, and eventually citizen opponents of the regime being sent to the gulag.\n\nIt’s also an opportunity to educate people about the realities of our immigration system. In my experience, most native-born people have no clue what a complicated, expensive, nonsensical, and above all slow process it is. It still takes years (if not decades), thousands of dollars, a gigantic pile of paperwork, and a lot of luck for regular people who do it all right. (Rich people, naturally, get to just buy their way in.)\n\nThe truth is that there is no serious immigration crisis in terms of America’s ability to absorb new people—a few million a year in a country of 340 million is just not a big deal. Economic studies show large benefits from historical immigration; with declining birth rates, we would be even more advised to allow a plentiful supply of new workers. Besides, most Americans are themselves descended from relatively recent immigrants; unlike most of Europe, America has long experience in absorbing people from other cultures. That’s what was happening in Springfield, Ohio, with a bunch of Haitian refugees before Chris Rufo and JD Vance started spreading racist, knowingly false blood libels about them.\n\nRepublicans are able to create a perception of a crisis in part because the legal process is so clogged up that applicants’ cases can’t be adjudicated quickly, and so people pile up at border checkpoints or decide to try their luck and sneak across.\n\nAt any rate, Democrats have long been addicted to chasing polls. The idea, heard today among the “popularist” crowd, is that messaging should be constantly tweaked and tuned to fit whatever happens to be polling well that day. More successful parties, like the Republicans, understand that they have a substantial ability to affect what polls say through their own messaging. Trump did not give up on his xenophobic project in 2020 when opinion was dead against him; he just kept pushing his message, and eventually the public followed. Democratic electeds, funders, and activists ought to be making the case for immigration everywhere they can.\n\nFurthermore, what Republicans don’t understand—or simply ignore—is that policy affects polls too. Trump built up public support for mass deportation, but when it came time to actually do it, that support crumbled. It follows that if Democrats were to win power and ram through comprehensive immigration reform even if it polls poorly, much of the energy would drain out of the issue. Sometimes the Band-Aid is best ripped off.","summary":"Americans gradually bought the Republican sales pitch on immigration.

Van Hollen in the tropical paradise of El Salvador!'\n\nPopular Trump-aligned accounts on X, including Libs of TikTok, slammed Van Hollen for his cozy chat with deported thug.\n\nOne person pointed out that in Van Hollen's official post on X, he didn't include the picture showing the margarita glasses. \n\nAnother responded directly to the senator's post and said, 'Hey Chris!! This is the real picture. How were those margaritas??? President Bukele posted this one. No hiding the truth from America.'\n\nA third wrote: 'Senator Chris Van Hollen and Kilmar Abrego Garcia sipping margaritas with salted rims…Thirsty Thursday in El Salvador.' \n\nVan Hollen has not responded to the social media outrage yet, but in his post about the meeting, he said he called Abrego Garcia's wife 'to pass along his message of love.' \n\nThe lawmaker did not provide an update on the status of Abrego Garcia, whose attorneys are fighting to force the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the U.S.\n\nA spokesman for the Trump administration remained on message, claiming Van Hollen was worried more about a 'terrorist' illegal migrant than his own constituents.\n\n'Chris Van Hollen has firmly established Democrats as the party whose top priority is the welfare of an illegal alien MS-13 terrorist. It is truly disgusting. President Trump will continue to stand on the side of law-abiding Americans,' Kush Desai told DailyMail.com.\n\nBukele's post on X ended with emojis of the U.S. and El Salvador flags, with a handshake emoji between them. A spokeswoman for El Salvador´s presidency said she had no further information. \n\nThe meeting came hours after Van Hollen said he was denied entry into an high-security El Salvador prison Thursday while he was trying to check on Abrego Garcia's well-being and push for his release.\n\nThe Democratic senator said at a news conference in San Salvador that his car was stopped by soldiers at a checkpoint about two miles from the Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT, even as they let other cars go on.\n\n'They stopped us because they are under orders not to allow us to proceed,' Van Hollen said. \n\nAbrego Garcia entered the US illegally in 2011. A judge blocked his return to El Salvador in 2019, citing the fact that gangsters were after him, but said he could be deported elsewhere. \n\nIn court filings this week, the Trump administration said he was deported to El Salvador in error. The Supreme Court has since ordered the Trump administration to facilitate his return to the US. \n\nLate Thursday, a three-judge panel from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously refused to suspend a judge's decision to order sworn testimony by Trump administration officials to determine if they complied with the court's instruction to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return. \n\nThe Trump administration´s claims that it can't do anything to free Garcia from an El Salvador prison or return him to the US 'should be shocking to the intuitive sense of liberty that Americans far removed from courthouses still hold dear,' the court said Thursday in a blistering order that ratchets up the escalating conflict between the government's executive and judicial branches. \n\nJudge J.

This will be a conversation of particular interest to our listeners on KABC in greater Los Angeles, but I think it will also be very relevant and interesting to listeners across the country because Gavin Newsom wants to be president of the United States. It’s very obvious. That is his ambition. He’s a very ambitious person, always has been, and he is planning to run, win his party’s nomination, and then become president. In 2028. That’s the game plan. I don’t have official confirmation of that, but everything about this man exudes that ambition. And he wants to effectively impose his state’s model on the rest of us. He wants to California-ize. He want to preside over the Californication of the United States of America, and I suspect a lot of voters might object to that. One thing that we’ve talked about is the excessive government and regulation and taxation out in California. And then, especially when those horrible wildfires hit, a lot of important questions were raised. What did all of that tax money actually buy for the people of Southern California? They paid for the most expensive government practically on the face of the Earth. And then when a real crisis hit… The government failed badly. Mismanagement of water resources. I mean, you go down the whole list. The mayor was on the other side of the world, despite warnings at the time. And Gavin Newsom asked about some of these problems. At one point, just sort of shrugged and said, well, it’s someone else’s fault. Now, you’ll have to talk to the locals about that one. California is presented as this pinnacle of progress by its defenders and its leaders. So, I would love a progress report. You might say nothing could have been done about the fires back in January. I’m not sure that’s true. I think many better preparations could have be undertaken. They could have managed things much better. They could’ve had far better and more effective leadership in the moment. You can go down that checklist and I think very reasonably argue that this was a pretty big failure. But just for the sake of the argument, let’s just say it was completely an act of nature. Setting aside the arson and all of that, and their criminal problems that they have in Southern California, another component to all of this, let’s just say it was beyond everyone’s control. What are we seeing in the aftermath? What are the updates when it comes to the recovery? Here we are months later, almost a hundred days later, actually. The politicians ran to the microphones and said, we’re going to rebuild, it’s to be better than ever, and we’re gonna make sure we’re California strong and all that stuff. Well, how’s it going? Could some of the red tape and leadership failures and overregulation and all those burdens, could that be potentially getting in the way of a timely and reasonable rebuild? Let’s ask our guests, Will O’Neill is the chairman of the Orange County Republican Party. He’s been active in Southern California politics for many years. He was the mayor of Newport Beach, California. Orange County is just to the south of Los Angeles County. So they had a front row seat to a lot of that destruction earlier this year. Will, welcome to the show. Glad to have you here.\n\nO’NEILL: Thank you so much for having me.\n\nBENSON: All right, so let me ask you the question that I just broadly posed to the audience, but make it more specific for you. Here we are about 100 days later. What is the update? Where do things stand when it comes to rebuilding after these fires?\n\nO’NEILL: It’s going so poorly that it’s actually worse than people expected. And to put it in context, I think people sometimes forget this Los Angeles County, 10 million people, literally one in every 34 Americans live in LA County. So what happened there is really important for the rest of the nation. And so in Palisades, when you saw that fire completely devastated and I’ll just say real quickly, guy, I will not take that presumption that nothing could have happened only because we know that there was over a hundred million-gallon reservoir that should have been full. And it was empty because of incompetence in Los Angeles. And that caused, yeah, fire hydrants to run dry, which I will just say real quickly to your point, I was mayor of Newport Beach twice. Our firefighters went up and hooked up to dry hydrants. So there are a lot of us in Orange County as furious as anybody else. But when Palisades burned down, over 5,400 homes burned with it. In Altadena, in Los Angles County, over right around 7,000 homes. Burned. And so your question is, how’s it going? Well, in Los Angeles, the city of Los Angeles they have issued four, and I don’t mean like 40 or 400, I mean literally four permits to rebuild and in LA County they have issues zero.\n\nBENSON: So, Los Angeles City, four permits. Los Angeles County, zero.\n\nO’NEILL: Zero. And we’re talking about 100 days later. It’s not like they have not received permits. NBC reported last week that around 1,500 properties in the LA County area. So just a real quick note, Palisades, City of LA, Altadena, County of LA. So in Altadena, 1, 500 properties are ready for rebuilding, but zero permits have been issued and already 173 applications were submitted, but actually they just found last week only twenty three had even been initiated by the county a hundred days later and so it is just it’s it’s mind-blowing how badly they are handling this and so the most populous county in the in the nation\n\nBENSON: Right, and a very expensive place to live, where the government takes a ton of your money. And the argument is it’s what you need for progress and good services. And we saw how the good services were handled during the fire itself. Now in the aftermath, we’re seeing more of this evidence. When you did the quick math, I was jotting it down. In terms of homes, forget businesses, just homes. Did I hear you correctly that between Palisades and Altadena, that was about 12,000 plus homes.\n\nO’NEIL: Yeah, that’s the estimate is it’s over 12,000.\n\nBENSON: Okay, so 12,000 plus homes destroyed, four, 100 days later almost, four permits have been issued to start rebuilding. Why? And why are they just very slow to even begin the process of approving the permits? What is going on?\n\nO’NEIL: Yeah, you mentioned right at the top the discussion about the regulation and problems cutting through red tape. And the problem is all of these folks in leadership right now in L. A county and L.A. City have been building this red tape up for so long that they don’t know how to cut it. And this is true also, I would point out for the state. So when Gavin Newsom is talking about trying to cut red tape and he’s issuing executive orders, even the one he tried to expedite the one talking about environmental regulation, um, he actually still forced multiple agencies to be working with one another and create comprehensive plans. And I will just say real quickly, anyone who has ever dealt with government bureaucracies, especially ones as far away as Sacramento to LA, knows that when you direct agencies to create comprehensive plan. That is codeword for it’s going to take a long time and but yeah it is a habit And it is taking forever. So California has its own environmental protection agency, its own natural resources agency, and they have to be involved in debris removal. You also have the California Emergency Operations Center, which Newsom has directed to work with LA County, the cities of LA, Malibu, Pasadena, and Sierra Madre to even start to create this comprehensive removal and rebuilding. But even more than that, it just came out two weeks ago that they realized, Oh, in order for us to even do the utilities like electric and gas and water and sewer and basically anything that a first world country would have, they are being delayed because California has the Environmental Quality Act and also the California Coastal Act. And so Gavin Newsom issued another executive order saying, oh, okay, they don’t have to comply with those either. And so it’s just one of those things where you see over and over again in good times, just how long it takes to get through regulation in California. But in bad times when we expect them to actually step up and do the right thing They’re either they can’t even get out of their own way now\n\nBENSON: I remember at the time because Newsom was really patting himself on the back like look at me. I am cutting through this red tape We’re like, why does that exist? Why is there the red tape if you’re so proud of yourself for getting rid of the red Tape, why did it need to be there in the first place? If you’re gonna get rid of it during an emergency Maybe it wasn’t actually Serving a good purpose. That’s something that apparently never crosses their minds But even when he did this through executive order, it still didn’t actually have the intended effect because of all this other residual red tape, just your state is awash in these regulations and the result is almost 100 days after the fires, four building permits for homes in these communities. It’s just, it’s incredible. I want to ask you about this as well, because in Los Angeles, the mayor had a recovery czar, right, so had someone in, installed this man to oversee and facilitate the recovery in these devastated communities. That man has just resigned. What’s going on there?\n\nO’NEIL: Yeah, so this one is a good reminder of what L.A. Had available to them when they were making their last vote for mayor, right, because it was between Karen Bass and Rick Caruso. And Rick Caruso’s properties didn’t burn, and, you know, and so Rick Caruso has been incredibly critical of Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles, over and over and over again.\n\nBENSON: The one who was in Ghana?\n\nO’NEILL: Exactly. I mean, what are you doing? I was mayor twice of a city in fire-prone areas. I knew exactly when we were having these winds coming through in Southern California, and there is no scenario where I would have been gone, let alone halfway across the world. But that’s what she chose to do, and that is indicative of her leadership, and it’s why people in Los Angeles are furious with her.\n\nBENSON: Well, she’s launched an investigation into herself. So we’ll wait with bated breath for the results of that one. But go on, because now you have this recovery czar. She won, right? Elections have consequences. She won. And now what?\n\nO’NEILL: Yeah, so now she hired a gentleman named Steve sober off and he’s been around in real estate a long long time in LA And hired him as the recovery star But his tenure like you noted was very short and very volatile and he resigned last week And the reason for it was I mean it’s you couldn’t have written it Because right after she announced him then she immediately went out and hired an Illinois firm as if there’s no such thing As a California firm but an Illinois firm to handle rebuilding management for up to 10 million dollars and then said, oh, now Steve Soboroff is going to be overall ambassador to Palisades, whatever that meant, but also announced that he’s gonna be getting $500,000 for three months of work, until he didn’t, because a lot of people were furious with him getting paid that much. And so then she announced, well, nevermind, he’s going to doing this work for free. I’m not sure she talked to Soborof, though, because he then went to a very fancy private school event, invented in front of the crowd, apparently, and said that he was lied to, that he was supposed to get a contract, that he didn’t get a contract, and that news broke. But the mayor found out, and Soboroff had to apologize. So if you fast forward five weeks, Soborof has now quit. And he told the LA Times that Bass, Mayor Karen Bass, shut him out of high-level planning from the start. He said, quote, they haven’t asked me to do anything in a month and a half, nothing, zero. That is the recovery star of Los Angeles.\n\nBENSON: And I guess he was not doing the job because they wouldn’t let him, and instead they hired at great expense a firm from another real fabulously run place, Illinois. It’s just like, again, you cannot make this up. Meanwhile, turning away from the recovery from the fires, I want to ask you about this as well. There’s this new move in California. This is a Gavin Newsom project to give full healthcare coverage funded by taxpayers to every single illegal immigrant in California And surprise, surprise, the price tag for that has come in way above expectations. And Newsom has said, actually, we need tons of more money. And so he’s asked the legislature to fund a bailout, and the number goes up and up and up. It looks unsustainable to me, but this is something he is now embracing and that they’re pursuing in Sacramento, and I think they just passed it. Tell us about this misadventure.\n\nO’NEILL: So a year ago, Gavin Newsom signed legislation that, to your point, allowed for Medi-Cal, which is the California version of Medicare, to fund healthcare for everyone in the state, regardless of immigration status. And so, at the time, there were a lot of questions about, wait, how much is that going to cost? Because none of that, if the person is in the country illegally, can be refunded by the federal government or funded at all. So it’s all coming out of state taxpayer dollars. And the answer was, we think we know what it is, but we’ll have to see. Well, to your point, all of a sudden, out of the blue a month ago, Gavin Newsom’s administration came out and said, hey, we’re gonna take out a loan for over $3 billion that’s only gonna get us through the end of April, and we need another two and a half billion. So in total, $6.2 billion more than they anticipated spending. We need to take that out as a loan just to get us through June 30th of this year. And so, because of that, a state that is already in a deficit is now taking on loans to cover health care costs for people in the country illegally. You cannot make this up, but it’s California, so I suppose the reality is always stranger than fiction.\n\nBENSON: Well, and that brings me to the next point, which is the political future of Governor Newsom, because you can agree or disagree with what I said at the top, where I postulated that based on at least my perception, my eyes and my ears, watching this man operate for the last couple of years, he absolutely has designs to become president of the United States as soon as possible. And we’ve seen him make this attempted pivot on this podcast that he’s doing and elsewhere. And actually, no, he’s not this crazy raging leftist that he has governed as for years. He’s someone who wants to talk to everyone and be a moderate and find solutions and talk about what’s effective and what really works and not being overly partisan or ideological. That does not bear any resemblance to the way that he is run the state and the outcomes in the state. But that’s, I guess, the political facelift that he’s trying to perform on himself looking ahead to 2028. But then there are just these little obstacles to that. For example, what you just described, multi-billion dollar loans to pay for his policy of free taxpayer-funded free taxpayer funded health care for every illegal immigrant in the state. I just don’t know how you reconcile the Gavin Newsom makeover he’s trying versus the Gavin Newsom, not just record in the past, but record ongoing. What’s your view on what Newsom is trying to pull here?\n\nO’NEILL: Yeah, clearly he’s trying to run for president and it is the strangest thing for us in California watching him want to run president while anticipating that Kamala Harris is actually gonna be running for governor. They’re just flip-flopping and it’s not a good situation for any of us.\n\nBENSON: Good luck!\n\nO’NEILL: You know, he’s his biggest problem with trying to do, as you pointed out, a political facelift is 25 years of being in the public spotlight and taking position after position. Even CNN went after him for trying to claim on his podcast that he’s never used the term Latinx. And then they ran a montage of him doing exactly that. But you’re looking at an absolutely failed governor when you talk about how long it’s taken to even talk about putting high-speed rail into California when you realize that the most important thing for us to get the message out to people is to have them travel outside of California so they can see what gas prices are like in the rest of the country compared to California when you realized that he is trying to force electrification of all cars by 2030 in California without anywhere near the infrastructure set up to be able to do that Yeah, but, well, hang on, to be fair…\n\nBENSON: Well hang on to be fair to be fair the record is only two and a half decades it’s only 25 years that might be too small of a body of evidence to rely on because he said a few things that sound different on a podcast so hold your horses there Will that’s very judgmental of you.

She is now turning her back on the man she once claimed was her “f---ing hero” and calling him out on his “crazy old white man anger.” \n\nShe wrote on X Wednesday: “He’s so petty and vindictive rn. Tbh, rightfully so, but not when the wellbeing and livelihood of billions of people—damn near the entire world lay in ur hands. Someone needs to get him a cute little lorazepam rx and a high grade ashwaganda [sic] supplement because it can’t happen like this.”\n\nShe added: “Nobody on earth is afraid of crazy old white man anger. Old white men need to reinvent the archetype because it’s too predictable. Like China is just DUNKING on everyone right now.”\n\nBanks showed her support for the president last year after she was spotted at a Trump rally in Miami. \n\nYet Banks said she would not be voting for Trump because of Elon Musk, whose home she bizarrely claimed to have been trapped in for days while waiting for Grimes in 2018, being part of his campaign.\n\n“That man kidnaps his children, took photos of grimes getting sliced open during her c-section and sent them around, does a s--tton of grimy f---ed up s--t to tesla factory workers, stole PayPal, Weasled his way into tesla and has too many passports for my liking,” she remarked about Musk in November. \n\nDespite claiming to endorse Kamala Harris because of Musk who “belongs no where near American Politics.

We just wanted him to enjoy retirement like other presidents — not go out like this.”\n\nThe ex-aide noted that minority staffers had been growing disillusioned even during Biden’s presidency.\n\n“Black people elected Joe Biden, and then his senior team cut them off, even staff hired to help with engagement,” this person said.\n\nBiden’s first known speech since leaving office took place March 15 at a National High School Model United Nations conference (NHSMUN), followed by his Tuesday address to the group Advocates, Counselors, and Representatives for the Disabled (ACRD).\n\nOn Wednesday, the former president spoke to an invitation-only Harvard Institute of Politics seminar arranged by his longtime aide Mike Donilon. \n\nA Harvard spokesman said Biden was not paid for that visit.\n\nSpokespeople for NHSMUN and ACRD did not respond to requests for comment about whether they paid Biden — and if so, what amount.\n\nThe precise reason that Biden is struggling to find top-dollar audiences is unclear.\n\nThe quality of potential remarks aside, some former aides say that CAA — which declined to comment for this story, and which also reps former Vice President Kamala Harris — may be ill-positioned to book lucrative business conference gigs.\n\nAn alternate theory holds that interest in Biden’s thoughts will build over time. \n\nOne source close to Biden’s post-presidential office said that signing with CAA was a “bad decision.”\n\nThe Harry Walker Agency, which works with both Bill and Hillary Clinton as well as Obama, “has relationships with all these large annual conferences and clients looking for high-profile speakers,” this person said.\n\n“CAA is a Hollywood shop. They’re not set up to market speakers to, like, the national duty-free shopping conference. The bread and butter of paid speaking gigs is random large annual industry conferences.”\n\nA different source concurred in that assessment, but added they believed Biden could rebound.\n\n“I do not think he is a draw yet,” this former staffer said. “I think he will be more of a draw as Trump continues to dismantle our democracy.”\n\nBiden had little trouble raking in big sums post-vice presidency — as did his brother James and son Hunter, who offered their consulting services to foreign patrons during and after his eight years as Obama’s second-in-command.\n\nMuch of Biden’s prior success in the public speaking business came from colleges, which may have soured on the former president after he spent four years in the White House railing against the high cost of education and the ensuing burden of college debt.\n\nHis post-VP windfall included $190,000 to speak at Drew University in New Jersey; $182,000 from Lake Michigan College, a community college; $180,000 to appear at Vanderbilt University; $180,000 to speak at the University of Buffalo; $125,000 to visit Southern Connecticut State University; $100,000 to speak at Long Island University, and $93,000 to visit Brown University, according to public disclosures.\n\nA Biden spokesperson did not offer comment.","summary":"\"We just wanted him to enjoy retirement like other presidents,\" said one ex-administration official, \"not go out like this.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/17/us-news/joe-biden-having-trouble-booking-gigs-with-300k-per-speech-asking-price/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-nq75kwxyo-1744924165584.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744909800&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4ljuCEUl-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-17 21:46:08","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.325}]}
