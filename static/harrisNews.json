JB Pritzker about accusations of calling the president Hitler. Pritzker denied making any comments himself and Wallace went one step further saying that no Democrat had done so.\n\n“I don’t think any Democrat has,” Wallace said. “I think it’s a smear that they project back onto critics. JD Vance called Donald Trump cultural heroin, he called him America’s Hitler. The attacks on Donald Trump as a fascist came from three-star generals who worked for him.”\n\nO’Reilly than played a number of clips of multiple Democrats making those exact accusations. To name a few prominent faces who have said things about Trump: Joe Biden said he uses “Hitler language,” Kamala Harris compared him to Hitler, Hillary Clinton said a Trump rally looked like “a Nazi rally” and Rep. Jasmine Crockett said he was a “wannabe Hitler.”\n\n“That woman has the gall to say to her audience that she doesn’t think any Democrat has referred to the Trump administration as the Third Reich and Hitler,” O’Reilly said. “I mean, this is just beyond belief. I’ve never seen anything close to this in my 50 years of being a reporter. And you know why it happens? Because there’s nobody at NBC News – remember, Wallace still works there for another two weeks – who gives a hoot. They don’t care what they say. Total collapse.”\n\nWallace’s comments came earlier this week on her podcast “The Best People” where Pritzker remained adamant he had never called Trump Hitler. This came after comments he made at The Economic Club of Chicago drew parallels between Trump’s leveraging of ICE and the border patrol against illegal immigrants to the Nazi’s attacks on Jews.\n\n“This is how authoritarian regimes do it,” Pritzker said. “They create these kind of fake ideas that there’s an enemy out there and it could be sitting next to you at one of these tables. So just somebody sitting at your table that you don’t like might be one of those enemies. So let’s round them up, let’s make sure they are the subjects of the laws that we’re passing, because we don’t like who they are. That is what authoritarian regimes do.”\n\nHe added: “I can tell you, sitting next to Holocaust survivors, that what they will say in this moment is ‘This is what happened. This is what happened — people’s rights started getting taken away. People got accused of being immigrants’ — this is before the Holocaust really took place.”\n\nYou can watch the full “No Spin News” segment in the video above.","summary":"\"I think it’s a smear that they project back onto critics,\" Wallace said earlier this week about Dems comparing the Trump administration to the Third Reich\n\n\nThe post Bill O’Reilly Shocked by Nicolle Wallace’s ‘Gall’ to Claim No Democrat Has Called Trump Hitler | Video appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/bill-o-reilly-nicolle-wallace-democrats-call-trump-hitler/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/BillOReilly-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 23:28:11","author":"Jacob Bryant,Nicolle Wallace","authors":["Jacob Bryant","Nicolle Wallace"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.474},{"id":373885896,"title":"Gavin Newsom is part of a disgusting new trend: Privileged people inventing ‘poorigin’ stories","text":"Gavin Newsom raised himself on the mean streets of Marin County, California.\n\n“It was also about paying the bills, man,” he recently told former NBA stars Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes on their popular “All the Smoke” podcast.\n\n“It was just, like, hustling. And and so I was out there kind of raising myself, turning on the TV, just getting obsessed. I was sitting there with the Wonder bread [and] macaroni and cheese.”\n\nLike Steve Martin in “The Jerk,” Newsom apparently started out as a poor black child.\n\nEven Jackson laughed, saying it sounded like his own biography.\n\nBut it’s a fabricated “poorigin” story for the ages. \n\nNewsom left out a few key details in the portrayal of himself as a downtrodden latchkey kid who used sports to overcome his learning disability and go from stacks of Wonder bread to the French Laundry.\n\nThe 58-year-old comes from prominent Bay Area family. His father was a judge and attorney. Sure, his parents were divorced, and he was mostly raised by his mother, Tessa. She, like many people in America, worked more than one job.\n\nBut unlike most kids, Newsom was close to the nexus of power. Early on, he was mentored by political kingmaker Willie Brown and both his professional and political ambitions were financed by the Getty oil dynasty — his dad managed the billionaire family’s trust.\n\nBut hey, he was just hustlin’ and hooping his way out of trouble — all while looking like the rich d-bag in every 1980s movie.\n\nNewsom is a shameless chameleon who will morph into whatever persona pleases his present company.\n\nWhen he interviewed Charlie Kirk for his “This Is Gavin Newsom” podcast in March, six months before the Turning Point founder’s assassination, Newsom turned fawning: saying that his son was so pumped, he wanted to play hooky from school to meet Kirk.\n\nThis week, Newsom was asked on CNN how his son reacted to Kirk’s death. The California governor back-pedaled, saying his son “wasn’t a fan of him as much as he was familiar with him.”\n\nThe slick pretty boy is no fool. He’s laying the groundwork for a presidential run in 2028 and reading the room.\n\nHe’s also showcasing a major plot twist in America.\n\nSuddenly, there is this belief that to be somebody in the future, you had to have been a no one in the past. No access. No silver spoon in your mouth, and no advantages.\n\nIt’s why the phrase “nepo baby” has become the most withering label. Even established, wealthy stars want to unburden themselves of their privilege.\n\nIt’s why elites lean into victimhood, hoping it will absolve being born on third base. \n\nSometimes it’s annoying but harmless. Meghan Markle, the daughter of a Daytime Emmy-winning lighting director, lamenting how she “grew up on the $4.99 salad bar at Sizzler.” Or Victoria Beckham claiming in the “Beckham” documentary that her childhood was “very working class” — before her incredulous husband admonished her to “be honest” and admit her father drove a Rolls-Royce.\n\nBut things get murkier when it’s politicians scrubbing their real lives in service of the idea that the only virtue is in struggle and getting your hands dirty. Or, in the case of Kamala Harris, getting french-fry grease on your shirt from working at McDonald’s.\n\nTeam Harris thought that would be a clever way to her dirty up her resume and make her more relatable to working folks.\n\nThe Democrats used to be the party of the working class before abandoning them. In a bid to rebuild an out-of-touch brand, party leaders are overcompensating by clinging to any shred of a blue-collar existence.\n\nLook at their next great hope, Graham Platner — the self-professed “working class” man now running for a US Senate seat in Maine. (You know, the one who allegedly has a Nazi tattoo.) The Washington Post crowned him one of its “rugged guys of the 2026 midterms” while foodie mag Bon Appetit wrote about “How Graham Platner Went From Working-Class Oysterman to Maine’s Zohran Mamdani.”\n\nPlatner’s father was a prominent attorney in Maine. As a kid, the candidate briefly attended Hotchkiss prep academy — a place so pricey the tuition could secure a down payment on a home. \n\nAnd, of course, there is Mamdani, the son of a Columbia professor and an Oscar-nominated director, who downplays his family’s wealth and masquerades as a workingman’s savior rather the champagne socialist he is.\n\nThe great irony is that Donald Trump, a billionaire, has charmed the working class by flaunting his tax bracket. He knows how rich people act because he’s one of them, and he’s sharing the secrets.\n\nStuck in an identity crisis, the Dems are struggling to find authenticity and common sense.\n\nBut no one needs to be insulted by a guy like Newsom reimagining himself as a man of the people. Americans are smarter than that.","summary":"Democrats used to be the party of the working class.

Email noor.qurashi@dailymail.co.uk \nBy NOOR QURASHI, NEWS REPORTER \n Published:22:32 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:22:32 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nDame Judi Dench has hit out at plans to replace 500 trees with a bottled water factory.\nThe Oscar-winning actress said the proposal, earmarked for Rotary Wood in Harrogate, is 'an act of environmental vandalism'. \nIt would see Harrogate Spring Water expand its plant on Harlow Moor Road.\nDame Judi's comments were read out at a meeting of North Yorkshire Council's planning committee on October 28.\nThe star, who is originally from York, said: 'To destroy Rotary Wood for corporate expansion would be an act of environmental vandalism - erasing a thriving habitat planted by children and nurtured by a community that believed in protecting our future.'\nGreen Party Councillor Arnold Warneken, who has been involved with the campaign for four years, shared the comments on behalf of Dame Judi.\nHe said the actress has strong local ties, including her late father working as a GP in the area, adding: 'It helped draw attention to a wider audience, so it was very useful in that respect.'\nDame Judi has other links to Harrogate, including being a long-standing patron of Harrogate Theatre.\n\nDame Judi Dench (pictured) has hit out at plans to replace 500 trees with a bottled water factory\n\nSigns of protest over Rotary Wood. The proposal would see Harrogate Spring Water expand its plant on Harlow Moor Road\n\nProtesters gather holding signs that read, 'Save Rotary Wood'. The group has staged several protests, including one ahead of the most recent meeting\nShe is also a patron of the Woodland Trust and, along with actress Emma Thompson, called last year on the government to support the environment as part of the Restore Nature Now campaign organised by Chris Packham.\nIt's not the first time she has supported woodland in Yorkshire - last year at the Chelsea Flower Show, she planted a seedling in the National Trust Octavia Hill Garden from the Sycamore Gap tree.\nIn a recent BBC documentary, she said: 'Ever since I was a little girl I have been interested in trees. I've even turned my six-acre garden into a secret woodland, and I see my trees as my extended family.'\nRichard Hall, the managing director of Harrogate Spring Water, told councillors the expansion plans would create 50 jobs.\nHe added: 'The central matter of concern raised during the consultations was the loss of trees in Rotary Wood.\n'Our proposal will create a new area of publicly accessible woodland the same size as the area that would be lost.'\nBut Neil Hind, of the Save Rotary Wood campaign group, said: 'The site forms part of the Pinewoods green corridor, a living woodland used daily for walking, education and wellbeing.\n'This is not just a spare piece of land. Its loss would be permanent and contrary to council policies.'\n\nProtesters dress up, with one holding a sign that reads: 'What happened to the designated asset of community value?'\n\nThe committee ultimately voted to defer the decision until a future meeting when more information is available. Pictured: 'Save Rotary Wood'\nThe group has staged several protests, including one ahead of the most recent meeting.\nCouncillor John Mann said more than 1,000 objections had been lodged - compared to just 11 expressions of support.\nThe committee ultimately voted to defer the decision until a future meeting when more information is available.\nCouncillors had asked for a clear explanation on how exactly the lost trees would be replaced - as well as more details on plans for a new wet woodland near the bottling plant.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDame Judi Dench brands Harrogate Water's plans to chop down 500 trees to expand its factory 'an act of environmental vandalism'\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Ella attended the WWD Honors on October 28 in New York City and exclusively shared with HELLO! what that period of her life was like, revealing: \"I was living every day in the moment. I think there's a lot that comes with virality like that, a lot of positive things and a lot of really negative things.\" To help keep her mind at peace, she came up with a clever solution: \"My go-to is don't read the comments, positive or negative.\"\n\nElla believes the conscious decision to stay out of the online chatter kept her calm in the chaos that was occurring around her. She added: \"I think it can, for me specifically, really get to my head and could make me overthink the way that I live, and I think that's one of the things that I love about myself, is that I live the way that I want to live. That is kind of the way I've gone through it.\"\n\nThe designer also got support from her mother Kerstin Emhoff during the time. She recalled: \"My mom was always telling me, grounding me, 'Don't read it, don't think about it, just be who you are and be here for the family because that's what it is.' We were being there for our family.\"\n\nElla stayed focused on the little moments and making memories with her family instead of listening to the outside noise. She expressed that one of her favorite things to do with Kamala is cook.\n\nShe wholesomely expressed: \"Every time that we've spent cooking in the kitchen, one of my favorite times was in high school when it was just me and my dad and Kamala and my mom. [My favorite is] when we would just cook Sunday night dinners. She makes this amazing chickpea casserole, and it is chef's kiss. \n\nElla added: \"She taught me so much in the kitchen, and I think food is such a community builder and especially for family. It's rare that you can just sit down at a dinner table anymore and hang out and connect.\"\n\nKamala recently revealed that she is open to running for president again because she has a deep-rooted passion for what she does, and if she moves forward, the family will stick together once again.","summary":"Kamala Harris’ stepdaughter Ella Emhof attended the WWD Honors on October 28 in New York City and exclusively spoke with HELLO!","url":"https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/864557/exclusive-kamala-harris-stepdaughter-ella-emhoff-reveals-coped-during-presidential-election/","image":"https://58v76y8z87lo.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/d41d9659147b-gettyimages-2243890130.jpg","video":"https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/xjyovOfN.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-29 21:43:18","author":"Nova M Bajamonti","authors":["Nova M Bajamonti"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.581},{"id":373869918,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: 'Real Housewives' Divorce Bombshell — Bravo Star Could Be 'Individually Charged and Prosecuted in Criminal Court' If She Walks Away From Marriage","text":"If Real Housewives star Wendy Osefo decides to go ahead and divorce her husband, Eddie Osefo, she could still be charged and prosecuted in criminal court, RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal.\n\nErnestine J. Mings, a partner in Blank Rome's Matrimonial and Family Law Group, spoke exclusively to us to explain what's going on.Could a Divorce Have an Impact on Potential Charges Against Wendy Osefo?As Bravo fans know, Real Housewives of Potomac star Wendy Osefo and her husband, Eddie Osefo, were arrested earlier this month for felony fraud. \n\nAfter Wendy and Eddie requested separate criminal trials, chatter online started to question if she would possibly be looking to leave him in hopes of getting out of any trouble. \n\nWhen asked if a divorce could have any impact on potential charges, Mings told us, \"The short answer is no.\"\n\n\"There are distinct laws, standards, and rules applicable to criminal cases that are not typically factored into divorce cases,\" she continued. \"She could still be individually charged and prosecuted in criminal court outside of any divorce proceedings.\"What Impact Would a Divorce Have?As for what divorce would impact, Mings shared it affects the \"dissolution of the marital relationship and the issues related thereto (custody of children, distribution of assets, spousal support, etc.).\"\n\nIf Wendy did decide to end up leaving Eddie, Ming explained it would be \"potentially\" to \"gain an advantage in terms of securing custody of the children and/or a more favorable distribution of assets as part of the divorce.\"\n\nShe added: \"This argument would be most persuasive if he were convicted of a crime (or crimes) and she was completely absolved of all criminal liability.\"What Did Wendy and Eddie Osefo Allegedly Do?As RadarOnline.com previously reported, documents showed Wendy is facing 16 charges, including 7 felonies, for allegedly making false/misleading info fraud in excess of $300. She's also facing one misdemeanor count of making a false statement to an officer\n\n\"In 2024, Wendy claimed her home was burglarized,\" an insider shared at the time. \"The arrest has to do with them allegedly faking the burglary.\"\n\nIndeed, a search on Maryland's Court cases pulls up all of Wendy's charges. The charges are listed as \"FALSE/MISLEADING INFO FRAUD\" with multiple having an offense date of 4/8/2024.\n\nThis tracks, as the date her home was reported to have been robbed was 4/7/2024.\n\nLater, it was confirmed the duo were arrested for allegedly committing insurance fraud by falsely reporting a burglary at their home.Will Wendy and Eddie Osefo Be Deported?People have also questioned whether Wendy and Eddie will be deported, as they are both originally from Nigeria and became naturalized citizens. \n\n\"They have no ICE detainers against them as of now, and these days ICE is very proactive in beginning proceedings swiftly after an arrest,\" a source recently told a media outlet.\n\nRegardless of their naturalized citizenship, though, a legal source noted they could still potentially face deportation.\n\nJudith Delus-Montgomery, an immigration attorney, stated Wendy and Eddie's case typically would not have been one that interested her. \n\n\"However, this President [Donald Trump] and this administration have indicated that they are going to start denaturalizing citizens if they don't like what they're saying, if they don't like their politics… if they can find a way to do it, they will do it,\" she said. \n\n\"These people [Wendy and Eddie] who have been to the White House, they have pounded pavement for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. We see that [this administration] has the ability to go after whoever they want and to make a mountain out of a molehill.\"\n\nShe also noted if the government were to look at Wendy and Eddie's citizenship applications and found any issues, they could potentially lose their citizenship and be deported.","summary":"A 'Real Housewives' star could still be charged in criminal court if she were to walk away from her marriage, a legal expert shared.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/real-housewives-wendy-osefo-divorce-charged-in-criminal-court/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/e6XEQx3E5/0x0/real-housewives-divorce-bombshell-star-could-be-charged-in-criminal-court-1761762915293-1761762918358.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 21:20:00","author":"Matt Richards","authors":["Matt Richards"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":373868152,"title":"Sydney Sweeney goes VIRAL for devouring hot dog at Dodgers game in flirty snaps","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTV host Kirsty Gallacher breaks down as she reveals she was physically assaulted by a stranger while walking on a busy central London street last night\n\nRachel Reeves has broken housing law by unlawfully renting out her family home without a licence after entering Downing Street: Chancellor faces ethics probe\n\nMillions of Brits over 55 set to face travel chaos as Ryanair launches new rules\n\nHSTikkyTokky's final humiliation revealed and how he's now accused of glassing a man in the neck\n\nWilliam is now King!

commodity prices on gold and crude oil; and events from all major sports leagues.\n\nTruth Social CEO Devin Nunes said the platform's new 'Truth Predict' feature seeks to 'create a new standard' in a market he claimed 'global elites' controlled.\n\n'We're democratizing information and empowering everyday Americans to harness the wisdom of the crowd, turning free speech into actionable foresight,' he said.\n\nPrediction markets allow people to bet real money on real-world events by effectively trying to predict what will happen in the future.\n\nPrices update in real time, meaning that users can react instantly to developments.\n\nKris Marszalek, co-founder and CEO of Crypto.com, lauded Truth Social's new feature and said prediction markets would become a 'multi-deca-billion dollar industry.'\n\nPrediction markets drew attention during the 2024 US presidential election, even catching Trump's eye last October.\n\nHe posted a screenshot from Polymarket, a popular prediction market, showing that he was handily favored to beat Kamala Harris.\n\nCloser to Election Day, billboards went up around New York City showing Trump and Harris's live betting odds on Kalshi, another prediction market.\n\nNow, the US president's media company wants in on the action.\n\nTrump Media's stock jumped after Tuesday's announcement, although the uptick was short-lived.\n\nPrediction markets are federally regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), whereas sports betting offered by the likes of DraftKings or FanDuel is governed by state laws.\n\nThat means that a California resident, where gambling is illegal, would be unable to make a traditional sports bet - but they would be allowed to use a prediction market and place a wager on a game's outcome.\n\nInterest in prediction markets has ballooned recently, including among the Trump family. \n\nDonald Trump Jr. was named a strategic advisor for Kalshi in January 2025.\n\nHe said he used the prediction market on the night of the 2024 presidential election 'to know we won hours ahead of the fake news media.'\n\nTrump Jr. also joined Polymarket's advisory board in August.\n\nEarlier this month, the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange announced it would invest up to $2billion in Polymarket.\n\nThe prediction market was kicked out of the US in 2022 by federal regulators and fined $1.4million by the CFTC, although it is expected to relaunch stateside in November.","summary":"Users will be able to place wagers on elections, interest rates and inflation rate changes, commodity prices and events from all major sports leagues.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15238653/trump-truth-social-betting-prediction-market.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/29/20/103422729-0-image-a-11_1761770423323.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 21:01:48","author":"Editor,Wilko Martinez-Cachero","authors":["Editor","Wilko Martinez-Cachero"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.032},{"id":373854662,"title":"Kamala Harris must tread the Richard Nixon path to the White House","text":"There are few second chances at the peak of American politics.\n\nOnly one vice-president, Richard Nixon, has lost a presidential race then staged a successful comeback, winning the presidency in 1968.\n\nNow another California lawyer wants a second tilt at the White House — or what's left of it.\n\nFormer vice-president Kamala Harris told me in an interview for 7.30 about her 2024 campaign memoir, 107 Days, that Americans are turning up to book events to listen to her ideas.\n\n\"Tens of thousands of people are showing up for it,\" Harris said.\n\n\"I think there's an appetite for the conversation that I'm having with the American people.\"\n\nIt is clear that \"conversation\", while not stated bluntly, is an invitation to Harris's presidential campaign 2.0.\n\nThe first thing I heard before Harris stepped through the connecting door of the hotel suite, at London's storied Claridge's hotel, was her full-throated laugh.\n\nDuring the 2024 race, Donald Trump disparagingly called her \"Laffin' Kamala Harris\" and Republican opposition research said the laugh made her sound \"weird\".\n\nIn person, it's more of an asset.\n\nAustralian novelist Geraldine Brooks, who collaborated with Harris for more than two months on her book, described the former VP as warm, empathetic and \"salty fun\".\n\nThat warmth is the first impression she conveys.\n\nThe wider purpose of the interview was the questions that underpinned her memoir. Did Joe Biden cruel her pitch? And does she deserve the chance of another?\n\n\"We needed more time,\" Harris told me emphatically about the 2024 campaign against Trump.\n\nStill unwilling to burn Biden?\n\nOne hundred and seven days was the shortest presidential campaign in history. When Harris took over the Democratic nomination from Biden, support in the polls for the incumbent president was low and donations were drying up.\n\nHarris said it was a terrible mistake on her part not to have spoken up earlier about Biden's frailties.\n\n\"I reflect on not talking him out of running and why I didn't, and I asked myself was it grace or was it recklessness on my part? And I think it was reckless,\" she said.\n\nShe admitted she and other senior Democrats were \"mesmerised\" by a mantra that it was Joe and Jill Biden's decision alone whether he continued as the candidate.\n\nBut when pressed on the reasons for not raising Biden's cognitive decline, Harris gave a surprising answer; that her doubts were only about the then US president's capacity to campaign, not his ability to govern.\n\n\"I did not question Joe Biden's capacity to be president at all. I saw him in the Oval Office, in the situation room on a daily basis and I did not have any question about that,\" she said.\n\nHere was an obvious contradiction.\n\nUntil he dropped out, Biden was asking to be endorsed as president for another four years, until January 2029.\n\nWhat the world saw in his disastrous debate performance against Trump in June 2024 surely reflected on his capacity to perform in the Oval Office, not just on the stump?\n\n\"Joe Biden was not frail as president of the United States,\" Harris told me.\n\nBut she was also avoiding the trenchant criticism in the book that Biden had left her \"hurt and disappointed\" on a number of occasions.\n\nThose disappointments included the tense moments just before she was about to debate Trump, when Biden called and distracted her with stories about disgruntled donors and his own debates.\n\nI had to fill in the details of that story when she glossed over it.\n\nI asked if she was unwilling to have her toughest critiques of Biden captured on tape.\n\n\"Of course not,\" she pushed back.\n\n\"I wouldn't have written the book if I didn't want to be on the record about that.\"\n\nIt was Biden's decision in 2024 to ignore his own frailties, to hang on and thus compromise Harris's run at the White House.\n\nDespite the fact that Biden was struggling to win over voters, polling at 38 in some states — an unwinnable position — Harris did not want to make a sweeping assessment of his health.\n\n\"I have never doubted he had the capacity to be president of the United States,\" she said.\n\n\"If you want to talk about whether he had the ability to endure what a race for president of the United States would require in that political environment in 2024, as I've said in the book, I had concerns.\"\n\nShe was clearly not comfortable with the line of questioning.\n\n\"The book is not about Joe Biden. A lot of your questions are about Joe Biden and I would like to talk about the book in full.\"\n\nI asked one more:\n\nHarris replied curtly: \"I am focused on the present.\"\n\nEyes on the future\n\nHarris knows the facts about where the campaign stood before she took over, and that she turned the campaign from a losing proposition to a neck-and-neck race in the seven battleground states that would decide the election.\n\nFacing tough economic headwinds and surging inflation, with 72 per cent of voters saying they were angry and felt the country was on the wrong track, she turned the race into one of the tightest in the history of American politics, according to New York Times political analyst Nate Cohen.\n\nDespite that feat, Harris cannot untangle herself from the administration she served in.\n\nBut she also does not want to make enemies amongst Democrats who still feel positively about Biden or his team, some of whom still hold important positions in the party.\n\nShe did express her deep disquiet about the current state of America under Trump. It is a source of particular distress to her, a former state attorney-general, to watch the weaponisation of the Department of Justice against Trump's enemies.\n\nWith so much at stake for America, the final question is the one she will face with growing intensity: Why should the voters think differently about her if she runs again?\n\n\"I'm not at that point. I'm not focused on that. My focus is on the book tour and being out with the people and lifting their voices.\"\n\nHarris said she also wrote her book to ensure her voice would be part of the history of the 2024 campaign.\n\nBut as the jostle for leadership among Democrats continues, along with its profound challenge to recover the swathes of working class voters who have deserted to Trump, she wants her name to be part of the future too.\n\nWatch 7.30, Mondays to Thursdays 7:30pm on ABC iview and ABC TV","summary":"Richard Nixon did what Kamala Harris wants to.

Get the full series here. A panel at Harvard University billed as a discussion on bridging the bipartisan divide featured only members of the political left, including two Democrats who previously held elected office and the head of a high-profile group known for supporting left-wing causes. The participants in the Oct. 9 panel, called \"Across the Divide: Organizing to Build Bridges in Partisan Times,\" were former Democratic Rep. Joe Kennedy; former Democratic New Orleans Mayor and Louisiana Lt. Gov. Mitch Landrieu; and NAACP President Derrick Johnson. The event was moderated by former NBC Boston reporter Alison King. \"When I heard the initial question about the political divide, I kind of shift, because we no longer have a political divide, we have a national crisis in our democracy,\" Johnson said in his opening remarks. He then invoked Democratic talking points about the current government shutdown. DNC MEMBERS RALLY AROUND PRO-DEI RESOLUTION: 'THESE ARE AMERICAN VALUES' \"And as we look at the government shutdown now, let me share my opinion,\" he said. \"It's based on two basic things. How can they further cut or gut the Affordable Care Act, and/or distract from the Epstein files. So I don't think there's a political divide anymore, I think it's a national crisis of our democracy.\" Landrieu, who served as the co-chair of Kamala Harris' unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign and as the co-chair of the 2024 Democratic National Convention, opened by bragging about \"taking down four Confederate monuments in New Orleans.\" Landrieu also served in the Biden administration as the senior advisor for coordinating the implementation of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. TOP DNC OFFICIAL DEMANDS DEMS BE 'MORE AGGRESSIVE,' COMPARES TRUMP ADMIN TO POPULAR CARJACKING VIDEO GAME He said his organization, E Pluribus Unum, focuses on reaching across the political aisle to teach people about diversity and how to talk about race. He then pivoted to defending DEI, and without prompting, attacked Secretary of War Pete Hegseth. \"Like, Pete Hegseth is not qualified. You feel me on this? He's a DEI hire,\" he said, receiving applause from the audience, before launching into more left-wing talking points. DEMOCRATS GRAPPLE WITH PROGRESSIVE AGENDA VERSUS MODERATE APPEAL AS PARTY REGROUPS IN TRUMP ERA \"In my opinion, diversity is the nation's greatest strength. It is our superpower,\" said Landrieu. \"That word indivisibility means that we're so tightly bound that when we do it this way nobody can beat us. And when we come out of many and become one, nobody has ever beaten the United States of America when we did it.\" Kennedy founded an organization called The Groundwork Project, which he said has had a \"great partner\" in the NAACP \"from the beginning.\" \"In the fight to defend American democracy, frontline community organizers are our single most impactful asset,\" the organization's website says. It goes on to claim that \"anti-democracy\" forces in the Deep South, Appalachia and the Plains have been organizing \"largely unopposed for generations.\" CARVILLE REBUKES DNC OVER WOKE ‘LAND ACKNOWLEDGMENT’ LAMENTING TREATMENT OF NATIVE AMERICANS \"Today, these investments are bearing fruit, as anti-democracy forces are using the awesome civic power they have accrued in these places to threaten bodily autonomy, public education, voting rights, climate action and democratic freedom for us all,\" the site says. Kennedy also criticized President Donald Trump during his comments on the panel. \"Donald Trump is telling a story of America,\" Kennedy said. \"And it's compelling enough to a sizable enough population that that is a story that's being written about America. One story of America. That is not my belief of the story of America.\" He complained that Democrats have to defend the \"status quo\" against Trump while also defending democracy. \"One of the jiu-jitsus Donald Trump did in the last couple of years, was he made a Democratic Party that had traditionally been the party of trying to erode those power centers from corporate America or the consolidation of political power to in certain channels, to erode that and make it more diffuse, to empower everybody, to expand 'we,'\" he said. \"He flipped that and made the Democrats, all of a sudden, defending the World Trade Organization, and defending rule of law, and defending the status quo. Defending democracy at a time when people said, 'I can't make ends meet.'\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP \"The question now is, 'How does the Democratic Party define itself in the midst of this administration being both an establishment, because they've got the House, the Senate and the presidency and they are in power so by definition an establishment, and tearing down the structures of those same institutions?'\" A spokesperson for the Harvard Kennedy School told Fox News Digital that the school hosts a broad spectrum of political leaders from both sides of the political aisle. \"To become good public leaders, our students must learn to engage across disagreements and partisan lines — so we intentionally bring voices to campus from all across the political spectrum,\" the statement said. \"Harvard Kennedy School is proud to be one of the only places in America where students can engage with politicians from both ends of the political spectrum like Nancy Mace and Pramila Jayapal, with managers of both presidential campaigns, or with senior advisors of President Biden and President Trump — often in the same day or even the same hour.\" \"The purpose of this event was for leaders to talk about the importance of building bridges across our political divide, which is an important goal regardless of the political affiliations of the speakers,\" the statement continued. \"A specific event like this may contain viewpoints that people on any side might find unbalanced, but there is always another event — and another speaker — providing a different perspective.\" The school noted that it has recently hosted high-profile conservatives like Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, former Trump advisors Kellyanne Conway, Chris LaCivita, former Ambassador Nikki Haley, former Vice President Mike Pence, CNN commentator Scott Jennings, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, former Gov. Eric Holcomb, former Sen. Pat Toomey, Sen. Rick Scott, former Gov. Asa Hutchinson, former Ambassador John Bolton and many others. It specifically pointed to Pence's call for politicians to \"disagree without being disagreeable.\" \"Since the founding of the Institute of Politics, our mission has been to engage with the left, right, and center of the American political spectrum — and we remain deeply committed to that mission today.\"","summary":"Three prominent Democrats discussed bridging political divides at Harvard, despite no Republican voices being included in the supposedly bipartisan conversation.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/us/harvard-hosts-panel-bridging-political-divide-featuring-only-democrats-naacp-president","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/10/harvard-veritas-banners.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 19:49:08","author":"Peter D'abrosca","authors":["Peter D'abrosca"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.198},{"id":373844390,"title":"Tom Grennan shows off his chiselled abs as he strips naked for raunchy new shoot after 'using his body to full capacity' by channelling his addictive personality into fitness","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTV host Kirsty Gallacher breaks down as she reveals she was physically assaulted by a stranger while walking on a busy central London street last night\n\nMoment migrant calmly strolled out of a bank after stabbing customer to death at random after asylum claim was rejected\n\nKeir Starmer REFUSES to rule out breaking Labour's manifesto pledge on tax rises as PM fuels fears of huge Budget raid on workers\n\nHSTikkyTokky's final humiliation revealed and how he's now accused of glassing a man in the neck\n\nWilliam is now King!

I was dabbling in other substances, which weren't great for me, and mentally I was off-beat.\nHe continued: 'I’d let myself go completely when it came to fitness. So I got into the gym really for my mental state, and then I really got the bug. \n'My addictive personality shifted onto, \"I have so many goals in fitness, I’m going to make sure I use my body to full capacity and see how far I can take it.\" (Now I go to the gym) six times a week, whether I'm feeling like I can or not, I have to do it.'\nTom also admitted he felt completely at ease posing almost nude for the bold shoot. \n\nIn one steamy shot, the Something In The Water hitmaker reclined on a vintage round table wearing nothing but a pair of red-and-black striped boxers, a purple V-neck top and matching striped gym socks\n\nSwitching up his look, Tom flaunted his muscular physique once again as he posed on a carpet surrounded by sexy Polaroids, wearing a blue-and-white checked shirt teamed with jeans\nHe said: 'I think for me, I've always been open, and if something pushes me out of my comfort zone, then great. But being naked doesn't really push me out of my comfort zone – I enjoyed it.' \nThe chart-topper, who celebrated his 30th birthday earlier this year, reflected on how reaching the milestone initially scared him but has since filled him with excitement for the future. \nHe explained: 'Becoming 30, for me, was a scary thing. But now I'm 30, I'm very excited for the new chapter of what life is.\n'I think I've grown up a lot since starting in the music industry at 21. I made a lot of mistakes, I'm not ashamed of that. I'm very much in a place where I’m like, \"That's my story\".'\nTom also spoke candidly about life as a new father after welcoming daughter Dottie earlier this year with his wife, Pilates instructor Danniella Carraturo, whom he married last summer.\nDiscussing how the pair are adjusting to parenthood, he said: 'When you're in the business that I'm in, when you say, \"I’m becoming a parent,\" everybody says, \"Well, that’s you finished.\" \n'But me and my wife are really managing it the way that we think is right, and at the end of the day, all that matters is that we have a healthy, happy child and that we both are still connected and we're communicating.\nHe added: 'I remember two people said to me, \"Well, you're not going to be able to do this and do that.\" And I remember saying, \"We're just going to have to allow this child to belong in our lives and not let the child run our lives.\"\n\nWhile in another sizzling snap, Tom went shirtless in nothing but a pair of drawstring grey shorts as he worked up a sweat with dumbbells\n\nThe star later showed off his suave side in a crisp white tuxedo paired with oversized sunglasses and black textured boots as he struck a pose on a balcony chair\n\nDuring the accompanying interview, Tom opened up about how fitness helped transform both his body and his mental health after a period of heavy drinking and unhealthy habits\n\n Tom Grennan secretly welcomes first child with wife Danniella as he says baby daughter is 'greatest gift' and reveals her sweet name \n'A lot of people say (fatherhood) changes you for the better, and I never really understood that until it happened to me.'\nIn August, the singer described his baby daughter as the 'greatest gift' and revealed her sweet name to fans after secretly welcoming his first child.\nIn an Instagram update, Tom shared that his latest album had reached number one and also revealed for the first time that he had 'stepped into fatherhood' with daughter Dottie.\nSharing a photo of Dottie with his award, he wrote: 'From the kid who never thought he’d make it, to three consecutive number one albums, joining an esteemed club to do so with the likes of The Beatles & Oasis - words will never be enough for the gratitude I feel.\n'To now be stepping into fatherhood at the same time is the greatest gift I could ever imagine. Music gave me purpose, but being a dad gives me everything. Here’s to the past that built me, the present that grounds me, and the future I can’t wait for!\n'Thanks to all the fans for once again making my dreams a reality, I really couldn’t do it without you all. It’s going to be amazing to see so many of you on the upcoming tour in September.' \nHe concluded: 'Honestly I’m so excited for what’s to come, we are just getting started. Tom x' \nA source told The Sun at the time: 'Tom and Danniella welcomed Dottie earlier this year and they’re absolutely besotted with her.\n\nTom also spoke candidly about life as a new father after welcoming daughter Dottie earlier this year with his wife, Pilates instructor Danniella Carraturo, whom he married last summer (both pictured in 2022)\n'It’s been massive becoming parents, but they’ve taken to it like ducks to water and are so happy.\n'To become a dad to Dottie was the best thing to happen to Tom. And now he’s got his third No. 1 album, it’s like the cherry on the cake for him.' \nThe couple became engaged in 2022 and married in May 2024 at a luxurious estate in Majorca.\nThe pair reportedly met in a lift in 2020 but split and then got back together during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTom Grennan shows off his chiselled abs as he strips naked for raunchy new shoot after 'using his body to full capacity' by channelling his addictive personality into fitness\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

He speaks with an attempt at gravitas. He gestures theatrically. But the effect is depressingly dull. He can only speak in his trademark weary, jaded style.\n\nPerhaps it was the topic at hand. We were in a darkened corridor in the Capitol for the latest edition of the interminable press conferences he and Speaker Mike Johnson, a Republican, hold each weekday about the government shutdown. Johnson usually speaks at 10am. Jeffries gets the 11am slot. Their scripts over the past four weeks have been the same: that the other guy refuses to negotiate. The only novelty is the location – will today’s conference be held in the windowless basement room? Or perhaps on the steps outside the Capitol? That they cannot agree on a budget means staffers in the building are going without pay, as are most federal workers. Even the Capitol gym has closed. The House meets pro forma, meaning that representatives register their presence in the chamber, as the rules require. They then impotently return to their offices.\n\nEmperor Trump is too busy ruling his subjects to worry about something as procedural and bureaucratic as a shutdown. According to the New York Times, he’s got Timothy Mellon – scion of the Gilded Age robber baron – to donate $130m (£98m) to pay military personnel. Who needs Congress when oligarchs can take care of the wage bill? That allows Trump to jet off around Asia, finesse plans to invade Venezuela, and order demolition crews to destroy the White House’s East Wing to make space for an opulent ballroom.\n\nThis presidential extension has been pilloried in the liberal press. The anger stinks of justified desperation. Everything liberals have tried so far has failed, and so they are invoking symbolism. It’s common for presidents to rejig the White House, and a big room to host state events is in itself not a bad idea. But reconstruction allows for a metaphor of Trumpian proportions. He is rebuilding the government in his own gaudy image. He did not seek permission from the conservation authorities. The oligarchic class is handling the cheque. Trump also boasts that the taxpayer won’t be charged – a perfect encapsulation of how great wealth insulates government from anything voters might have to say about what is done in their name.\n\nThe more Trump plays by his own rules, the more liberals pine for a leader. The tussle inside the Democratic Party is between those who are resigned to the Trumpian age and those who imagine an Obama-like figure will swoop in to return the US to the early 2010s.\n\nOn one side, like a woodpecker who has confused a concrete wall for a tree, we have Kamala Harris musing another presidential run. On the other, there are the left populists, who are much closer to the grain of successful politics as we find it in 2025.\n\nBernie Sanders recently tried to bridge the gap between the Democrats and today’s politics by noting that “what Trump has always understood, unlike many Democrats, is that the system is broken”. He went on to point out that this moment in American history requires more than “establishment-type candidates”. On a podcast, he hit Democrats on an issue on which they have ignored voters when he asserted that “Trump did a better job on the border”. He added that you can’t have nation states with people illegally entering the country.\n\nIn New York, another lurch towards voters is taking place. Zohran Mamdani, the left-wing Democratic mayoral candidate who calls himself a democratic socialist, is trying to land his upstart campaign. Mamdani, despite his woke past, has chosen to hit the notes of class politics above more familiar cultural gripes. He is polling much higher than his closest rival, the scandal-ridden former governor Andrew Cuomo, who has resorted to spreading fear about what the first Muslim mayor might do in office. (Cuomo has denied accusations that that he is stoking anti-Muslim bigotry.) Mamdani’s victory would pump up the pressure on the party establishment to be more radical.\n\nBack in the corridor at the Capitol, I asked Leader Jeffries whether he thought his refusal to endorse Mamdani was splitting the Democratic Party and therefore the main – and at present, only – vehicle to oppose Trump. One Axios poll showed dozens of candidates running for the House in the midterms would not support Jeffries’ leadership. Yet he said this was the most unified he had seen the Democrats this year – a statement that only makes the contrast with reality more stark.\n\nJeffries, who is also from New York, had not then endorsed Mamdani, for reasons he would not state. As he told one reporter: “I have not refused to endorse. I have refused to articulate my position.” It was the Democratic version of Trump saying he had “concepts of a plan”. This sort of enervated rhetoric shows the Democratic establishment is losing control of the narrative even as it seeks to reassert its control over the party.\n\nHours after the press conference, Jeffries reluctantly, and by now pointlessly, endorsed Mamdani. Election day in New York is 4 November. As it approaches, Democrats in Washington have been scuttling in the dark trying to understand the country they hope to govern once again.","summary":"They struggle even to endorse their own rising stars","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/world/americas/north-america/us/2025/10/why-are-the-democrats-so-crap","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/10/29/gettyimages-2238831747.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 19:35:03","author":"Freddie Hayward","authors":["Freddie Hayward"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":373843436,"title":"Trailing Liz Truss on the Maga speaking circuit","text":"Since the start of this year, I have been one half of the Politics at Sam and Anne’s podcast duo, co-hatched by Politico and Sky News. It means a dawn start for Sam Coates and me, recording from home on our coffee drips. Sam’s fluffy white cat purrs approval of our scoops or the latest gossip on Morgan McSweeney. We’ve dealt with builders blasting Ukrainian house music early doors and the alarming vicissitudes of hotel upload speeds. A crucial takeaway for podcasters everywhere is that microphones, as Sam noted when I complained about mine last week, “work better if you don’t drop them”.\n\nPraise be the finance dudes\n\nThe cause of this minor incident was racing around Lynchburg, Virginia with Liz Truss for an interview to figure out what exactly, besides the obvious appeal of the fees, attracts Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Truss to the Maga speaking circuit. The former Tory PM was speaking at a Christian conservative gathering at Liberty University, a glitzy campus founded by the late TV evangelist, Jerry Falwell.\n\nOver giant mugs of tea (students and staff must take a no-booze vow), we heard millenarian views of Trump’s ascendancy and the Lord’s general approval of his mission. The eye-opener for me was the deep bench of senior business folk who could switch from talking about finance in the agriculture sector and dealings with UK bank titans to rousing religious acclamations.\n\nTruss thinks the UK would benefit from a private conservative Liberty University of its own. She also told me she quite rates Zack Polanski and thinks the Greens might be the next opposition party. Curiously, Zack hasn’t been in touch to say thanks for this endorsement.\n\nLabour’s Wilde moment\n\nI am glad that Labour’s quarrelsome deputy leadership contest is over. Differences of opinion and style are fine, but the tone was overly abrasive. Accusing your competitor of courting “more distractions, infighting and noise” as Bridget Phillipson did, rather sounded like the cabinet candidate didn’t expect a rival at all. Meanwhile, Lucy Powell’s nettled tone about “ill-advised” social media posts by Phillipson sounded a bit aggrieved. As one of Oscar Wilde’s golden exchanges goes in The Importance of Being Earnest:\n\nJack: “I’ll bet you anything you like that half an hour after they have met, they will be calling each other sister.”\n\nAlgernon: “Women only do that when they have called each a lot of other things first.”\n\nPhillipson and Powell are far more agreeable in person, but it might be a good idea to show that to the rest of us.\n\nA word in your shell-like\n\nOn Fridays, we head down to East Kent for respite from Westminster and a change of social scene. Luckily for us, the Countess Sondes was hosting an autumn dinner at her place in a secluded valley. Phyllis Sondes is a dynamic Long Island native who married the last Earl Sondes and inherited an impressive swathe of countryside and waters, including her own oyster beds, after his death. There is also a barn full of giant tortoises, led by the polyamorous Sydney, who, along with two females, has produced 150 offspring.\n\nAt the human table, I sat next to a veteran Republican who was there for the shooting. A former senior official in the George HW Bush administration and still active on the DC “Hill”, he was not convinced that a Trump-style Maga candidate could win a third term. Thin margins in a handful of swing states last time around, and the propensity of Americans to tire of incumbents, left him reckoning that the Democrats are more likely to return if they could “get the barnacles off the boat” by not annoying working-class voters quite so assiduously as they did during the Kamala Harris adventure.\n\nPolitical horseflesh\n\nThe exchange reminded me that American political lingo is the best: my new friend described California’s up-and-at-’em governor, Gavin Newsom, as “100 pounds of premium political horseflesh”, citing his readiness to pivot on any issue, from oil refineries to trans rights, if it meant being in contention for the next presidential race. The phrase isn’t about whether you like a politician, but rather describes how good they are at being one. It also got me thinking about who would fit the top-notch horseflesh bill in Britain. Tony Blair, still at it. George Osborne, a relentlessly devious chancellor. Nigel Farage is the stand-out example today. Among the colts, Wes Streeting is a decent portion, as is Robert Jenrick. Let me know who I have missed, as Ofcom would say, with due impartiality.\n\nAnne McElvoy is executive editor of “Politico” and co-host of the “Politics at Sam and Anne’s” podcast\n\n[Further reading: Abolish the monarchy]","summary":"Also this week: reflecting on Wilde, and American political lingo","url":"https://www.newstatesman.com/diary/2025/10/trailing-liz-truss-on-the-maga-speaking-circuit","image":"https://dl6pgk4f88hky.cloudfront.net/2025/10/29/gettyimages-2200872154-800x418.jpg?1761766512","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 19:34:43","author":"Andrew Harnik,Anne McElvoy","authors":["Andrew Harnik","Anne McElvoy"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.067},{"id":373837044,"title":"Daughter of Trump-hating comedian given 'scary' prison sentence","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTV host Kirsty Gallacher breaks down as she reveals she was physically assaulted by a stranger while walking on a busy central London street last night\n\nMoment migrant calmly strolled out of a bank after stabbing customer to death at random after asylum claim was rejected\n\nAfghan refugee is charged with murder of dog walker stabbed to death in Uxbridge\n\nHSTikkyTokky's final humiliation revealed and how he's now accused of glassing a man in the neck\n\nWilliam is now King!

'Prayers welcomed. #addictionawareness #love #family.'\nHer post comes after Chelsea's probation was revoked earlier this month, resulting in a prison sentence handed down on October 22, according to court documents obtained by Us Weekly.\nThe outlet reported that an official from the treatment drug court said Chelsea, who has been in custody since September 9, 'was in violation due to sexual assault allegations.' \nThe official added that 'Chelsea had not shown significant progress in the treatment drug program.' \n\nRosie O'Donnell is asking for compassion and support as her estranged daughter, Chelsea, continues to struggle with addiction and faces new legal consequences; seen in 2016 \n'The facts surrounding this request have been staffed with the Marinette County Treatment Drug Court Team and have been deemed sufficient grounds to warrant termination from the Marinette County Treatment Drug Court Program,' the filing read. \nAn officer told Us Weekly that Chelsea will be transferred to the a medium-security prison, Taycheedah Correctional Institution, in Wisconsin. \n\n EXCLUSIVE: 'I'm worried about what's going to happen to her.' Rosie O'Donnell's adopted daughter's birth mom tells of anguish after 17-year-old was found with heroin criminal, 25, she met on Tinder \nIn a statement to People, O'Donnell shared her continued empathy and sorrow: 'I have compassion for those struggling with addiction — Chelsea was born into addiction and it has been a painful journey for her and her four young children. We continue to love and support her through these horrible times. Prayers welcomed.'\nChelsea's struggles have been ongoing. \nShe was first arrested in Wisconsin in September 2024 on multiple felony charges, including child neglect and possession of methamphetamine.\nAfter posting bail, she was arrested again a month later on additional felony counts, including bail jumping and resisting or obstructing an officer. \nA third arrest followed that November for possession of methamphetamine, bail jumping, and possession of narcotic drugs.\nIn March 2025, Chelsea pled guilty to three felony counts, resisting or obstructing an officer, felony bail jumping, and possession of methamphetamine, and was sentenced to six years of probation, two years for each count. \nHer misdemeanor charges for drug paraphernalia and narcotic possession were dismissed at the time.\nUnder the conditions of her probation, Chelsea was required to maintain absolute sobriety, avoid known drug users or sellers and refrain from possessing alcohol, firearms, or any controlled substances without a prescription.\n\nOn Wednesday, the A League of Their Own star, 62, shared a heartbreaking Instagram post featuring a much younger photo of her daughter, Chelsea, now 28 (pictured in 2006)\n\nHer post comes after Chelsea's probation was revoked earlier this month, resulting in a prison sentence handed down on October 22 \n\nDespite those terms, court documents confirm her probation has since been revoked. \nChelsea is a mother of four young children: daughters Skylar Rose, 6, Riley, 4, and Avery Lynn, 3, and son Atlas, who turned one this month.\nO'Donnell previously confirmed Chelsea's legal troubles in a 2024 Instagram post, writing: 'So yes, this is true — after being bailed out by her birth mother — Chelsea was arrested again. She is facing many charges related to her drug addiction. We all hope she is able to get the help she needs to turn her life around.'\nLast year, Chelsea spoke to DailyMail.com from jail, saying her mother had taken a tough love approach and refused to bail her out.\n'When I called Rosie to ask her to bail me out, she told me flat out, 'You belong in there,' Chelsea said. 'I really can't help you get out of there; I don't want you to kill yourself. I don't want to be responsible for you killing yourself.'\nAt the time, Chelsea also expressed frustration that her mother appeared more focused on supporting the Menendez brothers' bid for freedom than helping her own daughter. 'My mother is more interested in getting the Menendez brothers released from prison than getting me out,' she said. 'I have a drug problem. I need to go to rehab, but I never killed anyone like the Menendez brothers.'\nA representative for O'Donnell told Us Weekly in 2024, 'The family hopes that she gets the help she needs.'\nWisconsinRosie O'DonnellInstagram\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nDaughter of Trump-hating comedian given 'scary' prison sentence\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 46\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email: jordana.seal@dailymail.co.uk\nBy KATIE HIND, CONSULTANT EDITOR SHOWBUSINESS and GRANT TUCKER, ENTERTAINMENT EDITOR \n Published:18:39 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:19:10 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nTelevision presenter Kirsty Gallacher has told how she was physically assaulted by a masked attacker in Central London on Tuesday night as she walked back to her car in the dark after she finished work.\nThe former Sky Sports host revealed she was 'kicked like a football' during the unprovoked incident at 7pm which left her shocked and terrified – and added that she has the bruises to 'prove' what happened.\nRevealing the attack on Instagram, she said: 'Last night I was physically assaulted in the streets of central London walking from work to my car, the walk I do most nights. The streets are well lit. There were people around.\n'I was walking on the pavement, and I noticed this guy, all in black, covered up, actually, just walking at me. And I'm always vigilant. And he was just walking towards me, and so I moved out of the way, and then he brushed past me.\n'He turned around, and he kicked me like he was kicking a football. He kicked me in the middle of a street at about seven o'clock last night, in front of people, and I turned around and he scarpered.\n'I'm still shocked now, and I have the bruises to prove I'm afraid. I can't quite believe what happened. I was not being provocative in any way. I was just going about my business as you do. I was just walking to my car to go back home to my family.'\nKirsty, also said she found it 'hugely disappointing' as a nearby security guard was 'absolutely useless' and 'didn't do anything.'\nHowever, she did thank a woman who came forward to help her.\n\nTelevision presenter Kirsty Gallacher has told how she was physically assaulted by a masked attacker in Central London on Tuesday night\n\nThe former Sky Sports host revealed she was 'kicked like a football' during the unprovoked incident at 7pm\n\nKirsty, has two sons named Oscar, 18, and Jude, 15, from her marriage to former rugby star Paul Sampson\n'I luckily had some witnesses, some lovely girls saw it and came to my aid. There was a security guard on a door nearby who was absolutely useless and didn't do anything, which was hugely disappointing, and I just there, and I couldn't actually believe that someone, a stranger, has just decided, for whatever reason, whether he's a got a problem with women, whether he's just an opportunist.\n'He decided he did not like me, and he just thought, Now, give you the boot. And that is not okay. It's not okay, it's not okay.'\nKirsty said she decided to speak out about the attack because she believes such violence is becoming common place in London.\nLondon is the 15th most dangerous city for crime in Europe as concerns continue to mount over a growing epidemic of violence, theft and robbery, according to Numbeo's Crime Index.\nThe capital, which is also the 100th worst out of 385 locations around the world, is less safe than rival European cities from Athens to Brussels and Milan to Barcelona.\nLondon is also worse than major US cities such as New York, Los Angeles and Dallas as well as other global destinations from Cancun to Cairo and Bali to Bangalore.\nThe city is however only the fifth worst UK location for crime - behind Bradford, Coventry, Birmingham and Manchester.\nThe data, which is compiled from global survey responses and has been updated regularly since 2012, ranks London particularly badly for four categories out of 15.\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nKirsty said she decided to speak out about the attack because she believes such violence is becoming common place in London\n\n Knife crime in capital nearly doubles in a decade as report shows West End becoming hotspot \nThese are the capital's 'level of crime'; 'crime increasing in the past five years'; 'problem people using or dealing drugs'; and 'safety walking alone during night'.\nFormer GB News host Kirsty said: 'It's really sad that that is what's going on on the streets of London, and that is very real. And we all hear about it, don't we all hear like, Oh yeah, you know, be careful. Don't have your phone out.\n'And people being sadly, you know, mugged or worse, you know, awful, awful things going on, and you always think it's not going to happen to me.\n'And that was me. I thought, I'm very vigilant. I'm very careful. I'm very careful of where, how I'm walking, and, you know, make sure that I don't have my phone in my hand, that I have, like, a cross body bag, and I'm not holding anything out, but actually, I couldn't have done more to protect myself. And still that happened to me.\n'Someone decided to just give me a good kicking in the street, and I really wanted to share it with you, because this is happening all the time, and it's not good, and it's not all right, and I want you to really be careful and vigilant and look after yourselves and look after those around you.\n'And I'm very grateful to those lovely girls. Hopefully they'll see this, they might see this, but thank you, because you're amazing.\n'Because I didn't know what to do in that moment, I was shocked. I've never experienced anything like it, and I just wanted to share it, and I really just wanted to say, stay safe. You might not think it's going to happen to you, but it could be you.'\nYour browser does not support iframes.\n\nRevealing the attack on Instagram, she said: 'Last night I was physically assaulted in the streets of central London walking from work to my car.'\n\n Gabby Logan and Kirsty Gallacher show off their youthful looks as they pose during Greek holiday \nKirsty, who has two sons named Oscar, 18, and Jude, 15, from her marriage to former rugby star Paul Sampson, was arrested for drink driving in Eton, Berkshire back in 2017. She was subsequently banned from driving for two years. She was found to be over three times the legal alcohol limit, with a reading of 106 micrograms per 100ml of breath.\nMatt Goodwin, senior visiting professor of politics at the University of Buckingham, wrote in the Daily Mail in June that 'London is over. It's so over.'\nHe cited data showing that more than 70,000 phones were stolen in London last year, and there were 90,000 shoplifting offences in the capital, up 54 per cent.\nProfessor Goodwin added that there is now an alleged rape every hour in London – and reported sexual offences against women and girls has risen 14 per cent in five years, while homelessness and rough sleeping increased 26 per cent in one year.\nMeanwhile a policing expert told the Mail that London 'crime-ridden cesspit'.\nEx-New Scotland Yard detective Peter Bleksley said the force was now so stretched in the West End that private security companies were being deployed to help.\nHe condemned the 'epidemic of crime' in London from pickpocketing to violence and fare evasion to robbery, adding that it was 'driving people away' from the capital.\nKirsty Gallacher\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nTV host Kirsty Gallacher breaks down as she reveals she was physically assaulted by a stranger while walking on a busy central London street last night\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 339\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Bernie Sanders (I-VT) sees what voters are thinking and is trying to get out in front of the more damaging issues for Democrats. In a recent podcast, Sanders tried to claw back trust for Democrats on the border issue. “Trump did a better job,” Sanders said, speaking of President Donald Trump, former President Joe Biden, and the border. “I don’t like Trump, but we should have a secure border. It ain’t that hard to do. Biden didn’t do it.” He even added, “If you don’t have any borders, you don’t have a nation.”\n\nThe problem for Sanders and Democrats is that no one believes that Democrats believe this. Sanders himself has a long history of supporting amnesty for illegal immigrants already in the country and supporting decriminalizing border crossings. Sanders opposes detaining the vast majority of illegal immigrants. The immigration policy from his 2020 presidential campaign was centered on disbanding immigration enforcement agencies and integrating illegal immigrants into communities across the country.\n\nPut it this way: Does anyone really believe that a Sanders presidency would have secured the border and deported criminal illegal immigrants the way Trump has? Or would it just be the same de facto open borders policy of the Biden administration, which Sanders didn’t mind until it cost Democrats an election?\n\nARE THE DAYS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY’S EXISTENCE NUMBERED?\n\nDemocrats have become far more radically left-wing in the past decade. Democrats are lining up to endorse the terrorist sympathizing socialist in the New York City mayoral race. They prioritize protecting illegal immigrants and giving them handouts over making life easier for everyday Americans. They want lesser sentences for violent criminals, men to be able to use girls’ locker rooms, and to eliminate border enforcement agencies.\n\nVoters see that, and politicians such as Sanders paying lip service to voters’ concerns is not going to be enough to win them back. Those voters just witnessed four years of Biden pretending to be some kind of centrist while overseeing the most left-wing presidency of their lifetime, and they rejected Kamala Harris’s attempts to distance herself from her left-wing positions of 2019. Voters are smarter than Democrats think they are, and Democrats aren’t going to get away with faking their moderation while supporting wildly left-wing policies as they are now.","summary":"Some Democratic politicians and groups have come to the conclusion that Democrats should simply pretend to be more moderate than they are to win back voters.

What’s more, Gruters said that Republicans actually having a leader in President Donald Trump — as compared with Democrats who are essentially leaderless and visionless as radical leftists seize power in their party — bodes well for the chances of GOP candidates up and down the ticket.\n\n“We’re two and 39 in off cycle elections — that’s the incumbent party in charge of the White House. But the difference is we have a president that’s as committed to winning as they get,” Gruters told Breitbart News. “All the guy does is win. He’s a winner across the board, and I think that the candidates are going to be able to ride on his back all the way through the midterms. We have a solid strategy from using his positions that he’s championed with the Big, Beautiful Bill. If you look at what he’s been able to accomplish over the first 250 days — no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, additional child tax credit, all the small business advantages we got in terms of depreciation, expensing and helping these businesses across the country. Then you look at the fact that we have the president of peace with peace deals. Now you have the fact of his efforts to go in and clean up the cities, from a law and order perspective. If you go in and look at what he’s done across the board on all fronts. But from a strategy standpoint it’s very simple. From a party standpoint, we’re going to focus on the fundamentals, and that’s registering voters, turning voters out, and protecting the vote. Election integrity is by far what the president talks to me most about, and trying to make sure that we get everything right. We have 92 active lawsuits across the country. We used to play more of a reactive game, but now we’ve been a lot more active and going after some of the cases where we think we win and where we have to defend. That’s red states, blue states, purple states, and that’s dealing with cleaning up voter lists, making sure we have equal access for poll watchers and workers, making sure we don’t allow illegal aliens to vote, whether it’s any type of ballot integrity issue itself, on and on and on. We’re not facing the DNC in these lawsuits. We’re facing these third party groups, these left-wing organizations — and it’s the Republican Party, the Republican National Committee, that’s going out there and doing all that work on behalf of the overall umbrella.”\n\nHolding the U.S. House majority will be the most difficult task for Republicans next year, as an already-slim majority faces the historical trends of a midterm election usually seeing the pendulum swing back the other way. But, Gruters made it clear he thinks this is doable for the GOP in 2026. As he sat with Breitbart News, he held up a list of what he said were 46 competitive House races nationwide. Most of the districts on that list are seats currently held by Democrats. Before even discussing the mid-decade redistricting battles playing out right now, if Republicans can hold some of their tough-fought seats and flip some Democrat-held seats, they could be in a position to pull off mission impossible in Congress. Throw in the redistricting fights playing out right now coast-to-coast and the Republicans can grind this out and beat the Democrats.\n\n“We have on the House side, you could say, we have the Trump 13,” Gruters said. “There’s 13 seats that the president won where we have Democrat members of Congress. It’s a matter of fact, what this list is, is that we have 46 competitive races. But we have a lot of races that Trump won, 13, and we have all these other competitive races. There’s only three, the Kamala-won [districts] that we have Republican congressmen. So those 16 are probably the most competitive races in the country. For us, it’s all about candidate recruitment, making sure we find the right candidates in the right races. We’re actively involved with that. Then you can see everything that’s happening with redistricting. You know, [a top RNC staffer] was out there in Indiana with the Vice President, working on some stuff on behalf of the party. But we’re making sure that we leave no stone unturned… and we’re working every single angle to make sure that we put ourselves in the best possible position to win.”\n\nAs for the U.S. Senate, Republicans have a 53-seat majority right now meaning Democrats would need to net at least four seats to retake it — a monumental task. Republicans are aiming to hold seats in Maine with Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) and in North Carolina where incumbent Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) is retiring, giving way to former RNC chairman Michael Whatley running for the Senate. If those seats hold, Republicans have pickup opportunities in Georgia against Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-GA) along with the retirements of Sens. Gary Peters (D-MI) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH) in Michigan and New Hampshire respectively.\n\n“On the Senate side, we have a couple of must-holds with Collins, Whatley — I think they’re all relatively safe,” Gruters told Breitbart News. “I can go into those individual races, if you want. But then I think we got three great pickup opportunities in Georgia, which the primary obviously isn’t decided, in New Hampshire, and then [Mike] Rogers in Michigan. And so we have great opportunities on the Senate side. We have a lot of great opportunities on the House side as a result of some of our candidate recruitment. The big thing that’s a big difference between the first administration and this administration is everybody is working in conjunction with each other. We take all of our orders from the White House. I say I’m the chairman of the party, but the President’s leading this party. Everything that we do is in conjunction with him and that goes to say the same with the RGA and NRCC and NRSC — we all work together on a daily basis and so we’re not going to have a duplication of services or campaigning. We are going to make sure we’re firing on all cylinders. We maximize the dollars that the President has raised and that we’ve raised, and I think that although I’m cautiously optimistic about the midterms, we obviously have to do everything right. We have to continue to raise money. We have to make sure we do the fundamentals right in terms of getting our voters out and protecting the vote. And if we do everything right, we could buck the trends and end up winning.”\n\nAs of when Breitbart News sat down with Gruters last week in DC, Republicans have also been blowing away Democrats in the fundraising space and Gruters credited Vice President JD Vance who’s serving as Finance Chairman of the RNC as playing a big role in making that happen.\n\n“On top of that, we’re raising a ton of money. We have JD Vance as our Finance Chairman — the first time a vice president has ever done that. He’s out there at least a couple of times a month on our behalf,” Gruters said. “And as a result, we are sitting on $86 million I think — maybe it’s $89 million — right now in cash on hand versus Democrats’ $14 or $15 million. They could equalize that, but we’re out there every day working it.”\n\nGruters’ history before Trump asked him to lead the RNC was firmly in the grassroots, and particularly in ground game politics. He told Breitbart News he got his start years ago as a volunteer door walker when he was in high school, then moved up the grassroots ladder going so far as to even label himself “the grassroots chairman.”\n\n“You got to look at — where are we going to best spend our resources? I’d say it’s about the matter of winning,” Gruters said. “It’s about holding the majority and making sure the President has four full years. We have a national grassroots call later today that we’re going to have, and it’s with the focus of doing exactly that. We have a lot of friends and allies out there that do similar things, and we welcome them all because anybody who advances our cause to victory and helps us be successful we’re all for. So, yes, we’re going to be very aggressive. I would say I’m the grassroots chairman. I came from the grassroots. I literally started as a volunteer door walker in high school. became the grassroots walking chair from my county, then the Young Republican chair, then the county chair, then the state chair, and now the RNC chair. It’s crazy. I’ve been trained to do exactly this, and this midterm is going to be all about turnout — making sure we get the Trump voters, the people who came out for the president three consecutive presidential cycles, to make sure they come out for these midterms and to make sure that they understand how important it is in these down ballot races and what it means to the President. What we’ve seen from the shutdown — now we’re in day 20 of the shutdown — the Democrats, they’re not looking to do a Kumbayah moment with the President. They want to obstruct him. They want to impeach him, and they want to do everything that that they can to make the President feel pain. It’s not for the greater good because now you have these Democrats — they’re going against law and order type policies in terms of cleaning up the cities. It’s going against the peace deals. It’s going against the economic policies which by the way have led to 69 percent lower egg prices and the biggest investment of resources back into the manufacturing sector and back into rural America that we’ve ever seen in decades. We’ve been net outsourcing all of our jobs, and all of a sudden we got somebody in the Democrats — what they’ve always said is this is for the American worker. But here you go. You have the president on the H-1B visa program making it much tougher which is going to protect mid-wage earners here in America and then the fact that he’s creating fair trade policies will lead ultimately to more blue collar type jobs across the country. I say all that because there’s nobody that’s done a better job of working on behalf of the average everyday American worker than President Trump. He genuinely cares about Americans, and I think it shows in all the policies that he pushes on an ongoing basis.”\n\nGruters also highlighted to Breitbart News that over the last several years Republicans have made major inroads with voter registration — beating Democrats in the past four years in all 30 states that track partisan registration. The biggest shifts have happened in Gruters’ Florida, and he is now seeking to emulate that aggressive trend nationally for the GOP.\n\n“If you look at the 30 states that track voter registration over the last four years, we’ve won all 30 of them. You don’t go 30 for 30 by chance,” Gruters said. ““It’s all because the President’s policies, because of his willingness to reach across the aisle and build this coalition of people who love America. That’s what it’s all about. It’s, do you love America? Do you want to defend America? Anybody that believes — faith, freedom, family, right? Any of those things, you’re welcome. Our overall coalition, we’re not like the Democrats where you have to be a purist on that side. You could have different views on the Republican side and be successful within our party. People are seeing the left go to these woke extremes that are completely out of the mainstream and as a result we’re going to continue to do well. Yes, I think that our job as a party goes back to one of those three fundamental issues we’re focused on, that’s voter turnout. We do that by working with our different coalition partners, but we do that internally. That’s what the party is — we have 50 state parties. We have a thousand county and club organizations that we can mobilize and get out the vote. I think the President’s fully committed. When he recruited me, when he called me up and asked me to do this job, he told me that he was one hundred percent committed to winning the midterms and doing whatever it took. That meant helping us raise money, helping us be successful, creating an environment that will allow us to be successful, and he understands what’s at risk; losing is not an option, because I go back to the 20 days and the shutdowns that we’re seeing right now, the Democrats, their whole goal is to be obstructionist and to try to stop the president from being successful at any level because every day he is allowed to be the president is better for the party overall. As a matter of fact, I think what the President is doing is he’s making America great again by creating a culture, in an environment that the Republican candidates will dominate for decades if the President continues on the path and the pace that he’s going.”\n\nOn the GOP chances going into the midterms overall, though, Gruters emphasized cautious optimism if Republicans continue to follow Trump’s playbook.\n\n“It all comes out of the President’s policies, and he’s given us the roadmap to victory,” Gruters said. “We just have to do our job as a party and make it happen, and that requires a lot of work. It requires a lot of money. It requires us to go get the right candidates. But I think that the President has given us that path because he’s been so successful in these policies. If you look at whether it’s the Big, Beautiful Bill or these major issues that he’s tackling, they’re all 80/20 type issues. So when you talk to the average, mainstream American, they’re with us. We just have to make sure we continue to give them that message and vision and get them out. I think we could do that by convincing them and by showing them exactly why. What’s happening right now with the shutdown is what will happen for two years if we allowed the Democrats to end up winning any of these. I’m as confident as could be but with the understanding that we can only get there with hard work. We have to get our voters out, and we only do that by focusing on a comprehensive strategy internally, with our state parties, with all of our coalition groups out there, to make sure we turn those voters out.”\n\nWhile Gruters says things are looking up for the Republicans, he argues that as evidenced by the rise of Zohran Mamdani in New York City and other radical leftists taking over the Democrat Party that things are going exactly the wrong way long term for Democrats.\n\n“TDS [Trump Derangement Syndrome] is real. I think the fact that they’re about to elect a semi-Communist in New York City shows you the direction of the party and the people that they want to support,” Gruters said when asked to assess the other side. “You look at all their candidates. Look at their gubernatorial candidates. Look at the Attorney General candidate in Jay Jones. They don’t normally have tough primaries but when they do they’re electing these far left, extreme, woke individuals that are not part of the mainstream and as a result I think that that’s why the American people, the 30 out 30 states over the last four years, have gone towards us. I think that we have the winning message but more than the winning message I think it’s created by the fact that we have a president that’s willing to not only talk about it, but put this message into and make it reality because everything like I said during the first 250 days has been nothing less than spectacular. We’re carrying the ball down the field, and I think it’s going to be very hard for the Democrats to stop the momentum that the President has been building.”\n\nAsked if Gavin Newsom, the governor of California, is the leader of the Democrat Party, Gruters said they have no leader — but that all the Democrats are vying to be their party’s leader.\n\n“They all want to be the leader. You got J.B. Pritzker out there,” Gruters said. “You got Mamdani, you got AOC, but look at who they have to choose from. They’re a cast of characters that they call their leaders. They’re all out there away from the mainstream. I think it’s going to be hard for them to build the coalition they need to be successful.”\n\nGruters also said the Democrats are becoming more and more extreme, as well as more and more coastal and cosmopolitan.\n\n“Look at the No Kings rallies. I don’t know if you saw those pictures,” Gruters said. “It’s white elitists out there that don’t have grandkids to go watch soccer games and so they’re out there spending their time. They’re not watching college football. They’re out there protesting nothing. There’s no kings here! They’re protesting just to protest. If you look at all those interviews from the people that they’ve interviewed during these protests, nobody knows what they’re protesting about because at the end of the day, how could they be against the eight peace deals that the President signed? How could they be against the economic policies the President’s bringing with real change for the first time in decades, whether it be the Republican or Democrat Party? He’s actually creating meaningful change that’s real, that will be lasting for a generation as a result of what he’s doing right now.”\n\nHe added that Democrats are becoming as extremist as they are becoming elitist.\n\n“An elitist, anti-Semitic [party] with a Communist bent,” he answered when asked if Democrats are becoming marginalized. “It’s a losing party. Their policies themselves are losing issues, and they’re going to continue to be marginalized and they’re going to continue to shrink as a result of the extremism that they’re willing to go to to appease their mob base. The mob base, if you look at it, my guess is only 10 percent but because they’re so loud these candidates have gone so far to the left you can’t even recognize them anymore. It’s like Mamdani. What world do we live in that we think that a guy would take a picture with a guy who celebrated the World Trade Center bombings — and he’s taken a picture of him and he’s about to be elected in New York City? The fact is he’s basically an open anti-Semite and a Communist. It’s crazy. Mamdani and these other guys like AOC, they’ll continue to be the leaders of the party because they’re the most outspoken. They’re the ones people listen to and they’re who people are gravitating to. As a result, their party will continue to go further and further to the left which gives us a chance and a pathway to win for decades if we do everything right.”\n\nGruters also thinks that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries are not secure in their positions.\n\n“I always hear that Jeffries is not really the leader of the party anyway, that it’s still [Nancy] Pelosi that’s calling the shots,” Gruters said. “I mean, I don’t know. I’m not over there every day so I don’t know what’s really going on but you have to imagine that Jeffries and Schumer both are feeling the pressure from their left flank base but they both are sitting in a system where they’ve helped these other members get elected so they can continue to run and be their leaders. It’s only a matter of time before they’re taken out, and that’s why their refusal to condemn people like Jay Jones — whose disgusting and disqualifying remarks should have been enough to have him resign from his nomination for Attorney General, top law enforcement official in the state. But you look at that, and you look at this disgusting rhetoric that you’re seeing all across the country from the left and their willingness — and the polls have said it — I know this is a stretch, but there’s so many things that are going bad for the Democrats that I don’t know if there’s any bright spots whatsoever. On our side, we have the deepest bench I think we’ve ever had, and if you look at Trump’s cabinet they could probably all be President of the United States because they’re all so successful and they’re all so good at their jobs and they’re all — it’s like a machine. It’s like these guys are going to bat for the President, which is going to bat for America. I think that, and I go back to all the time to say that, you know what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania? I think God saved President Trump that day. I think that He saved him not only to save the country, but save the world. I think we were on the brink of losing everything with the failed leadership of Biden and Kamala Harris and all these other Democrat leftist leaders. In the president, he is showing every day what it takes to be a winner and what it takes to be a leader. So I think we’re absolutely dominating every aspect of every issue that matters to the average American voter.”\n\nHe added, too, that the conventional wisdom in Washington a decade ago that Democrats would benefit from demographic changes in the nation proved to be entirely wrong — and that it’s actually the Republicans benefitting from it as Democrats become more elitist and geographically limited while Republicans become more working class.\n\n“I think if you look at it, just like 10 years ago they said with the changing demographics of the country that Democrats were going to be able to hold on to power for decades, but what you’ve seen is exactly the opposite,” Gruters said. “Now Republicans have taken control — and now Republicans have moved the needle on voter registration — and it’s because, I go back to the President’s policies, we’re winning with new demographics like Jewish voters, minority voters, women. We’re crushing everybody, I mean, but everything goes back to the President’s policies.”\n\nGruters said even political donors — who are clearly giving more to the Republicans than the Democrats right now — see the writing on the wall regarding the long-term prognosis of weakness for Democrats and are shifting their strategies toward backing more Republicans.\n\n“So regarding the donors, yeah, the donors see what’s happening and the donors believe in the President,” Gruters said. “Everybody is winning. The RNC is winning, the NRCC is winning, the NRSC is winning. They’re all winning because of the President. The President’s leading for years and years and years. Everybody always says they want somebody that’s actually going to take action, not just talk about everything. Most elected officials, once they get in office, they want everybody to like them. It’s about legacy. It’s about everything else. With the President, all he cares about is making sure that America is the best possible country that we could be. He’s moving policies to push us in that direction and he’s winning over and over and over again. People see that. People want to reward that. That’s why we’re going to buck the trends and potentially change the historical narratives on these off-cycle elections. It’s strictly as a result of the fact that we have somebody who’s going to bat for the average American every single day.”\n\nAt the end of the day, victory in November 2026, he said, will all come down to whether or not Trump and the Republicans can turn out the Trump voters from 2024 when the president’s name is not on the ballot, although his agenda and continued success are on the ballot.\n\n“I’m cautiously optimistic about our opportunities but it’s only if we — the President’s given us a gift,” Gruters said. “He’s given the American public a gift. We just have to take what he’s given us and be able to communicate that to the people. And turn our voters out.”","summary":"WASHINGTON — Republican National Committee (RNC) chairman Joe Gruters told Breitbart News exclusively that he is “cautiously optimistic” about Republican chances to hold their U.S. House and U.S. Senate majorities next November.\n\n\nThe post Exclusive — RNC Chairman Joe Gruters on GOP Midterm Chances: ‘Cautiously Optimistic’ on Holding Majorities appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/10/29/exclusive-rnc-chairman-joe-gruters-on-gop-midterm-chances-cautiously-optimistic-on-holding-majorities/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/10/GettyImages-2230642551-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 18:03:51","author":"Matthew Boyle","authors":["Matthew Boyle"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.036},{"id":373822148,"title":"Former Biden and Bush press officials join forces to back Democrat in key governor’s race","text":"FIRST ON FOX: A former Biden administration spokesman and a veteran GOP communicator who both advise affordability-focused policy group the Cost Coalition are backing New Jersey Democrat Mikie Sherrill’s run for governor, Fox News Digital has learned. \"After analyzing the plans of both candidates in the New Jersey governor's race, the difference between Mikie Sherrill and Jack Ciattarelli on this defining issue of affordability is enormous,\" Cost Coalition advisers Andrew Bates and Terry Holt wrote in their joint endorsement first obtained by Fox News Digital Wednesday. \"Mikie Sherrill has bold ideas to use the specific powers of the governorship to make a difference that families will feel.\" Bates served as the senior deputy press secretary of the White House under the Biden administration, and was a strong supporter of the former president amid his mounting health concerns during the 2024 election.

Gavin Newsom, California Democrats are charging toward a new congressional map that could flip as many as five U.S. House seats from Republican to Democratic control. But first, they need voters to sign off.\n\nCalifornia voters head to the polls on Tuesday with just one yes-or-no question on the ballot. Passing Proposition 50 would implement a new congressional map, which passed the state legislature in August, for the next three election cycles. After the 2030 U.S. Census, the state’s independent redistricting commission would resume drawing maps.\n\nPoliticians around the country are reshaping congressional voting districts — a task typically done just once a decade, after each census — in an effort to give their parties’ candidates an edge in next year’s elections. The national battle over partisan gerrymandering began in Texas, after a push from President Donald Trump. The Republican-controlled state adopted a new map in August that could flip five Democratic-leaning U.S. House seats. California was the second state to make moves. Between the California legislature passing the map and this election, Missouri and North Carolina both adopted new maps. Other states may soon follow.\n\nThe outcome of this ballot measure could help determine control of the U.S. House after the 2026 midterm elections, which will see Republicans try to buck a historical pattern of the president’s party losing seats in midterm elections. The GOP’s margin is slim: Heading into Tuesday’s election, Republicans control 219 seats to Democrats’ 213, with three vacancies.\n\nIf Prop 50 is approved, it’s possible the Democrats could control as many as 48 of California’s 52 congressional seats, up from the 43 seats the party now holds. In some cases, the recast districts would slice across California, with one uniting rural, conservative-leaning northern California with Marin County, a liberal coastal stronghold north of San Francisco. In others, district lines are left unchanged or have only minor adjustments.\n\nPartisans have lined up on both sides of the measure, which has seen well over $200 million in contributions.\n\nIf support for the ballot measure breaks along partisan lines — which is not a guarantee — the Democratic-backed “Yes” side would be favored to pass. The Democratic Party has a statewide voter registration advantage of more than 4.5 million voters, and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris won California by around 20 percentage points last fall.\n\nOpponents of the measure, which include major Republican figures from the state ranging from former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to potentially affected representatives, have reported raising more than $80 million. National Republicans are kicking in: The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC dedicated to electing Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives, has kicked in $5 million.\n\nThe “No” on 50 campaign also benefited from the high-profile involvement of former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, one of the last Republicans to win statewide office and a longtime opponent of gerrymandering. They’re framing the initiative as a scheme by Democrats to boost their own influence and circumvent the voter-approved independent redistricting commission.\n\nBut the “No” campaign is shorter on cash than its opponents. The “Yes” side has raised around $138 million, according to data from the California secretary of state’s office. And data from AdImpact, the nonpartisan advertising tracker, indicates the “No” side’s ad spending has slowed to a trickle in the lead-up to the election.\n\nNewsom and both national and statewide Democrats have been very involved in advocating for the measure. Newsom contributed $2.6 million of his own campaign funds, while the House Majority PAC, an independent expenditure group backing Democratic House candidates, put in almost $15 million.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nThere are no automatic recounts in California. Any registered California voter may request a recount, but the voter or campaign committee represented by the voter requesting the recount must pay for it. The AP may declare a winner in a race that is eligible for a recount if it determines the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect:\n\nElection Day\n\nCalifornia’s special election will be held Tuesday, though mail-in voting has been available for weeks. Polls close at 8 p.m. PT, or 11 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot?\n\nThe AP will provide vote results and declare the winner in the redistricting ballot measure.\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAny voter registered in California may participate in the special election.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nAs of Sept. 5, there were about 23.1 million registered voters in California. Of those, 45% were Democrats and 25% were Republicans. About 5.2 million voters were not registered with any party.\n\nTurnout in the 2021 gubernatorial recall, an off-year election in which that statewide vote was the only contest on the ballot, was about 58%.\n\nAs of Oct. 28, a total of 4.74 million ballots had been cast before Election Day. See the AP Early Vote Tracker for the latest update.\n\nHow long does vote counting usually take?\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, the AP first reported results in California at 11:12 p.m. ET, or 12 minutes after polls closed. The vote tabulation ended for the night at 7 a.m. ET with about 54% of total votes counted.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 364 days until the 2026 midterm elections and 1,099 days until the 2028 general election.","summary":"As of Tuesday, a total of 4.74 million ballots had been cast before Election Day.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/29/california-election-prop-50-preview/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Election_2025_California_Redistricting_56334_82cb9f-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 17:35:23","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.099},{"id":373807784,"title":"NY GOP Congresswoman Leads Incumbent Democrat for Governor, Poll Finds","text":"In a surprising showing, Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is leading incumbent Democrat New York Gov. Kathy Hochul in a recent independent poll pitting the two New Yorkers against one another in a hypothetical governor’s race.\n\nThe poll, conducted by the Manhattan Institute between Oct. 22 and Oct. 26, found Stefanik garnering 43% support among a sample of registered voters from around New York state. Hochul polled 42%. The option of someone else garnered 9% in the poll, while “not sure” drew 7%.\n\n“The margin of error is ±4% for the NYC sample, and ±3.3% for the full New York statewide sample,” according to the Manhattan Institute. Still, the statistical tie is stunning in a state that voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in last year’s presidential election by double digits.\n\nHochul has thrown her support behind self-described democratic socialist New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani over her former boss, Andrew Cuomo, the former Democratic governor now running for mayor as an independent.\n\nEven some Mamdani supporters appear less than enthused by the New York governor. Hochul was heckled during her recent appearance in Queens with the mayoral candidate with calls to “tax the rich.”\n\n“Kathy Hochul and single-party Democrat rule have failed New York, making it the most unaffordable state in the country, with the highest taxes, energy, utility, rent, and grocery bills, making it unaffordable to raise a family, work, and start a business,” Stefanik spokeswoman Bernadette Breslin said in a statement, adding:\n\nNew Yorkers of all political parties are hungry for new common sense leadership after decades of Hochul’s failed, single-party Democrat rule.\n\nStefanik is a New York state native who has served in the House of Representatives since 2015. She was chairwoman of the House Republican Conference from 2021 to 2025. A prominent defender of Israel, Stefanik earned national press coverage over her grilling of university presidents in the wake of rising antisemitism on college campuses following the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terrorist attacks against Israel. \n\nHochul took over the governor’s mansion in August 2021 following the resignation of her predecessor, Cuomo. She had previously served as lieutenant governor of New York from 2015 to 2021 and as a New York congresswoman from 2011 to 2013.\n\nA separate poll found that only 39% of New Yorkers approve of Hochul’s performance as governor, compared with 56% that disapprove. \n\nStefanik has yet to officially declare her candidacy to be the Republican nominee for the 2026 New York gubernatorial election, but is expected to do so after the off-year elections next Tuesday.","summary":"In a surprising showing, Rep.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy CAROLINE PEACOCK, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:16:51 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:17:09 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy has revealed she's been in a car crash after her friend took her new vehicle out for a drive.\nOn Wednesday, Kate, 26, shared a clip on Instagram where she revealed she had been involved in a car accident.\nThe clip began with the caption 'How it started,' as it showed her getting into her brand new Lamborghini Urus, worth upwards of £200k.\nIt then cut to footage of the car's front end badly damaged, accompanied by the caption 'How it ended.'\nAlongside the post, she wrote: 'Lesson learned don’t let your girlfriend drive your brand new car.'\n\nLiam Payne 's girlfriend Kate Cassidy revealed on Instagram on Wednesday she's been in a car crash after her friend took her new vehicle out for a drive\n\nKate shared the clip on Instagram, sharing a picture of herself in front of her new car before the accident occured \n\nThe American influencer, 26, recently came under fire after her late boyfriend's sister appeared to accuse her of 'using his death for fame'\nLast week, Kate appeared to hit back at her late boyfriend's sister for claiming that people are 'using his death for fame'.\nKate took to Instagram over the weekend to share images of her paid-for luxury hotel trip, which took place during his anniversary on October 16.\nDays before the trip, Liam's sister Ruth appeared to take a swipe at Kate, writing in a tribute: 'Everyone only seems interested in the public side of this. Some sadly seem more interested in the fame they can gain off this...\n'But on the human side people need to remember when they speak, there is a son without his Dad, parents without their child and I am lost without my brother.'\nAmong her carousel of images, Kate raised her middle finger to the camera with her tongue sticking out in what some took to be a response.\nKate defiantly insisted Liam would have wanted her to go on the trip - a collaboration with Grande Cosmetics - which was located 20 minutes from her apartment.\nRuth's heartbreaking post described her grief in excruciating detail, as she penned: 'I underestimated grief, woah, did I underestimate it. I am paralysed by it daily...\n'I thought I had felt it before but I know the losses before you were just intense sadness, you are the loss of my life...\n\nDays before the trip, Liam's sister Ruth appeared to take a swipe at Kate, writing in a tribute: 'Everyone only seems interested in the public side of this. Some sadly seem more interested in the fame they can gain off this' \n\n Kate appeared to hit back at her late boyfriend's sister in what some took to be a response\n\n'The one person who l will miss at every single occasion in my life. I'd taken for granted that my little brother would be there through life. You shouldn't have died.'\nIt comes as it was revealed that she is open to dating again a year after Liam's death.\nPreviously Kate has shared that she suffered from depression after the 31-year-old pop sensation known for being a member of boy band One Direction, plunged to his death from a hotel balcony in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on October 16, 2024.\nA subsequent toxicology report revealed alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in his system.\n\n Kate Cassidy shares another unseen Liam Payne video \nNow, a friend of Kate's told the Daily Mail that she is ready to move on with her life after plenty of days when she wouldn't even smile.\nThe source added that she is not paying attention to gossip and new reporting surrounding Liam's death, including allegations from his friends that she is tormenting his family.\n'She's hanging out with friends and she's open to dating again, although she's not quite there yet,' the source said. 'There was a point where she was definitely not okay, but she's getting better now.'\nThe friend detailed Kate's dark days after Liam's death, which made headlines around the world and sparked a period of mourning from his global legion of fans.\n'There were months where I literally didn't see her smile, and I was seeing her every day,' the friend told the Daily Mail. 'It was so concerning, she didn't even seem like herself. She cancelled a lot of hangouts and just was almost a recluse.'\nBut now, the source said Kate is doing much better - adding she is back to posting fun-loving pictures on Instagram and seeing her friends.\n'She's moving forward now,' the friend said. 'She knows it's what he would have wanted.'\nInstagramKate CassidyLiam Payne\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLiam Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy reveals she's been in a car crash after her friend took her new vehicle out for a drive\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 49\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Now his path to Mideast post faces GOP opposition","text":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. ambassador to Kuwait faces steep odds of confirmation with several Republican senators planning to oppose Amer Ghalib over past remarks they say are antisemitic.\n\nGhalib, the mayor of the Arab-majority city of Hamtramck, Michigan, told The Associated Press on Wednesday that he does not plan to withdraw his nomination unless Trump asks him to — which the Republican president so far has not done.\n\nRepublican Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Dave McCormick of Pennsylvania have publicly said they will vote against Ghalib, while others have privately signaled the same, according to a congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss private conversations. With all Democrats likely to vote against Ghalib, the Republican opposition would be enough to sink his bid.\n\nIt would be the latest in a string of Trump administration picks to falter in the Senate.\n\nFor Ghalib, it amounts to a sharp reversal in his standing within the Republican Party. Nearly a year ago, on Election Day, Trump embraced him onstage at a Michigan rally, calling him “one of the greatest men in your state.” Trump has credited Ghalib with helping deliver stronger-than-expected Arab American support in the swing state last year.\n\n“He’s a great man,” Trump told the crowd. “If we win this state you’re going to be very responsible.”\n\nBishara Bahbah, founder of Arab Americans for Trump and a key figure in the president’s outreach, said in a telephone interview Wednesday that failure to confirm Ghalib’s nomination would send a “very negative message” to Arab Americans.\n\n“As it is, many in the community feel that they have not been properly paid attention to after the elections. And so this would, this would compound the situation,” Bishara said.\n\nCriticism of Ghalib by senators of both parties\n\nDuring a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing last week, Republicans and Democrats pressed him over past quotes and social media posts they described as antisemitic. The most scrutinized remarks concerned Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack on Israel and former Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, whom he allegedly called a martyr.\n\nGhalib did not deny many of the past statements, saying some were made as a private citizen or were mistranslated from Arabic. When asked about his “liking” of a Facebook response comparing Jewish people to monkeys, Ghalib acknowledged having a “bad habit” of acknowledging every comment under his social media posts. He said he disagrees with the statement.\n\n“Your long standing views are directly contrary to the views and positions of President Trump and to the position of the United States,” Cruz said. “I for one, I’m not going to be able to support your confirmation.”\n\nJake Murphy, a spokesperson for McCormick, confirmed to AP that the senator planned to vote against Ghalib’s nomination. Utah Sen. John Curtis is also “ deeply concerned” about Ghalib’s nomination, according to a statement from his spokesperson, Adam Cloch.\n\nHighlighting Ghalib’s dwindling chances, GOP Sen. Rand Paul told The Associated Press he believed the nomination had already been withdrawn. But Sen. James Risch, chair of the Foreign Relations Committee, told the AP that as of Tuesday night a vote was still planned.\n\nAfter the contentious Oct. 23 hearing, Ghalib wrote on Facebook that Trump had called him and expressed support. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nGhalib told AP by text on Wednesday that Trump had asked him to send additional information that the committee had asked for and then “see what would happen.” The president has not asked him to withdraw, according to Ghalib.\n\nTrump’s 2024 appeal to Arab Americans in Michigan\n\nA native of Yemen, Ghalib made national headlines in September 2024 when, while serving as a Democratic mayor, he endorsed Trump. His backing reflected a segment of the Arab American community that, while traditionally Democratic, opposed Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in part because of the Biden administration’s role in the war in Gaza.\n\nIn Michigan, which holds the nation’s largest concentration of Arab American voters, Trump made significant inroads in Arab majority cities such as Hamtramck and Dearborn, where he visited in the days before the election. Trump would go on to became the first Republican presidential candidate since George W. Bush in 2000 to win Dearborn, where nearly half of the 110,000 residents are of Arab descent.\n\nSince the election, some Republicans have criticized Dearborn, arguing the city — sometimes called the Arab capital of the United States — has not assimilated into American culture.\n\n“Muslims have been fighting to wipe out Christians and Jews for centuries. But now the problem isn’t just confined to the far-away Middle East. It’s happening right here in our backyard,” Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville said during a Senate floor speech Tuesday.\n\n“We’re already seeing cities in Michigan, Minnesota being taken over by Sharia Law,” added Tuberville, later calling out Dearborn in his speech.\n\nBahbah rejected those claims, calling them “not acceptable” and emphasizing the community’s electoral importance.\n\n“Islamophobia is totally unacceptable. The president does not participate in this point of view,” Bahbah said. “And it is sad that these senators come out and and try to slight a very important and growing Muslim American community in the United States.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Matthew Lee contributed to this report.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump’s pick for U.S. ambassador to Kuwait faces steep odds of confirmation with several Republican senators planning to oppose Amer Ghalib over past remarks they say are antisemitic.","url":"https://www.thestar.com/news/world/united-states/he-helped-deliver-arab-american-support-for-trump-now-his-path-to-mideast-post-faces/article_d6aeca5c-5a43-5aeb-b90a-4d42bf07b92f.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/thestar.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/6/56/656adb15-ef7e-5bc5-b80e-e038dfb5cb58/69024b97f0049.image.jpg?crop=1620%2C851%2C0%2C114&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 17:04:45","author":"Joey Cappelletti The Associated Press","authors":["Joey Cappelletti The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.103},{"id":373810166,"title":"MSNBC's Nicolle Wallace, JB Pritzker ridiculed for claiming Dems never called Trump Hitler","text":"Fox News’ \"Gutfeld!\" panel criticized MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace and Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker on Tuesday after they claimed no Democrats had ever compared President Donald Trump to Adolf Hitler. Gutfeld opened the segment by airing a clip of Pritzker's appearance on Wallace's \"The Best People\" podcast on Monday, where the two agreed that no Democrat has ever called Trump Hitler and that Republicans make such claims as a smear tactic. \"Wow, if only we had this thing called the internet,\" Gutfeld ribbed before playing a compilation of Democrats comparing the president to Hitler. CROCKETT DISMISSES CRITICS WHO THINK 'HITLER' AND 'FASCIST' COMPARISONS CONTRIBUTE TO POLITICAL VIOLENCE Gutfeld then introduced a video compilation that included prominent Democrats such as former Vice President Kamala Harris and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, who in a clip from July 19, called Trump \"wannabe Hitler.\" Mocking Wallace's producers for failing to inform her about \"something called reality,\" he quipped that, via a quick search on the internet, these instances would be readily available to them. During his interview with Wallace on Monday, Pritzker articulated a distinct line between drawing historical parallels in policy and comparing Trump to Hitler directly. \"I'm not suggesting, I haven't suggested Donald Trump is Hitler,\" Pritzker said. \"I don't think any Democrat has,\" Wallace said. \"And I actually think it’s a smear that they project back onto critics. But JD Vance called Donald Trump ‘cultural heroin.’ He called him ‘America’s Hitler.’ I mean, the attacks on Donald Trump as a fascist came from three generals who worked for him.\" PRITZKER SWIFTLY FACT-CHECKED AFTER CLAIMING HE NEVER DERIDED GOP WITH DICTATORSHIP COMPARISON: ‘PATHOLOGICAL' However, the record shows that many prominent Democrats, and Wallace herself, have drawn parallels between Trump and Hitler. After Trump drew cheers from a crowd as he embraced the word \"nationalist\" during a 2018 event, she replied, \"I watch enough History Channel to know that they cheered at Hitler, too.\" Fox News' Kat Timpf chimed in with her thoughts on Pritzker's claim, noting that the governor claimed he never even \"suggested\" that Trump was Hitler and \"set the bar very low for himself.\" \"So, when you were saying that the way Trump's immigration policy is — is a precursor to the Holocaust, what were you suggesting that makes Trump in those circumstances?\" Timpf questioned. \"I would love to hear his answer.\" \"Because if he would have said I never directly called [Trump] Hitler, maybe that's true. But what did you mean when you mean by all the stuff — you certainly suggested it,\" she added.

Email lettice.bromovsky@dailymail.co.uk \nBy LETTICE BROMOVSKY, NEWS REPORTER \n Published:16:39 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:16:42 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nA mother whose two young sons were murdered by their father has finally fulfilled the heartbreaking promise she made to them as they lay dying - that no other child would ever suffer the same fate.\nClaire Throssell, from Penistone, South Yorkshire, has spent more than a decade fighting to change the law after her boys Jack, 12, and Paul, nine, were killed by their abusive father Darren Sykes during a court-approved visit in 2014.\nSykes had lured the children into the attic of their family home with the promise of a new train set. \nBut once they were inside, he barricaded the doors, spread petrol around the house and set it alight in 14 places. He died in the blaze alongside his sons.\n'When I held him [Jack] in my arms, just like I did Paul,' Claire recalled, 'I made him one last promise. I said, 'No more children are going to die like you.'\nLast week - exactly 11 years after the tragedy - Claire was invited to 10 Downing Street after the Government confirmed plans to scrap the presumption that both parents should have contact with their children, regardless of concerns about abuse.\nThe change, she said, meant her boys' deaths had not been in vain.\nBefore the murders, Claire had repeatedly warned family court officials that her ex-husband posed a serious threat to her and their sons. \nShe described years of psychological torment and controlling behaviour but her pleas for supervised access were ignored.\n\nClaire Throssell (middle), from Penistone, South Yorkshire, has spent more than a decade fighting to change the law after her boys Jack, 12, (right) and Paul, nine, (left) were killed by their abusive father Darren Sykes during a court-approved visit in 2014\n\nPrime Minister Sir Keir Starmer meets campaigner Claire Throssell, at 10 Downing Street, London, in advance of an announcement on child protection reform\n\nTheir father had lured the children into the attic with the promise of a new train set before barricading them in and setting the house on fire \nA family court judge ruled that Sykes should have unsupervised contact, guided by the legal principle that both parents should remain involved in a child's life after separation.\n'I told the courts that he’d kill them,' she said. 'I told them what would happen. I couldn’t predict how, but I knew he would do it.'\nClaire was at work when Sykes collected the boys for what should have been a five-hour visit. \n'I missed them by five minutes,' she said. 'I was late home, and I missed them for that last hug.' \nWhen she arrived at hospital, she saw medics battling to save her sons: 'His little body was bouncing off the bed' as they tried to resuscitate Paul, before doctors told her they could do no more. \nJack died five days later from his injuries.\nClaire later learned that Jack had gone back into the flames to try to save his younger brother. \nIn the months that followed, Claire lost almost everything. Her house was destroyed, her savings were gone, and her home insurance had been cancelled by Sykes before his death. \nBut she refused to give up, wanting both her sons to have a 'legacy'.\n\n'When I held him (Jack) in my arms, just like I did Paul,' Claire recalled, 'I made him one last promise. I said, 'No more children are going to die like you'\n\nA family court judge ruled that Sykes should have unsupervised contact, guided by the legal principle that both parents should remain involved in a child's life after separation\nClaire soon began working with the domestic abuse charity Women's Aid, discovering that her sons were the 18th and 19th children killed by a parent during court-ordered contact. \nTogether, they launched the Child First campaign to reform family courts and make child safety the top priority.\n'The system is so flawed, it protects bad practice. It protects misogyny, it protects oppression and it protects fear.'\nShe continued that despite the legislation being in place it 'doesn’t take away the sting of walking into an empty room' as she has to 'live with that silence every day'.\nA new report published this year, before the law was changed, revealed that another 19 children have died in similar circumstances since Jack and Paul's deaths - a figure that left Claire 'devastated'. \n'I sat on the floor and cried, curled up and cried, because I’ve still not kept that promise, not just to Jack and Paul, but to every child that’s at risk.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nMother keeps heartbreaking promise to her sons murdered by their father that no more children will die after decade of tireless campaigning\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

He Says Trump Is on a New Level.","text":"\"I have not seen ever before a direct infringement on the right to free speech like that,\" CNN's @jaketapper tells @nickgillespie on The Reason Interview podcast. pic.twitter.com/42LHYb2sPt\n— reason (@reason) October 29, 2025\n\nIt's only been a little more than a month since Brendan Carr, the head of Donald Trump's Federal Communications Commission (FCC), explicitly called for late-night host Jimmy Kimmel to be pink-slipped by ABC and its corporate parent Disney. The president also chimed in at the time, averring, \"I would think maybe their [ABC's] license should be taken away.\" \n\nTrump's language was characteristically imprecise—the FCC doesn't license networks but only individual broadcast stations—but the threat was crystal clear: Put the kibosh on Kimmel or else suffer the wrath of the government, even as a key merger of major ABC station owners is coming before the FCC.\n\nSo far, it hasn't worked out Trump's way. After a brief suspension, Kimmel came back on air, seeing \"a clear late-quarter boost\" in the wake of the president's jawboning.\n\nIn a new interview with Reason, Jake Tapper, the host of CNN's The Lead and a veteran of both ABC News and '90s alternative site Salon, tells me that the Trump administration's attacks on the press are unprecedented in his years of covering politics. \"I have not seen ever before a direct infringement on the right to free speech like that.\"\n\nTapper isn't romanticizing Trump's predecessors. \"I don't like what the Biden administration did with social media companies,\" he says, referring to the way officials pressured platforms like Twitter (now X) and Facebook to remove or suppress the reach of content critical of its COVID and other policies. \n\nAs Robby Soave reported for Reason in 2023, \"health advisers at the CDC had significant input on pandemic-era social media policies at Facebook….They were consulted frequently, at times daily. They were actively involved in the affairs of content moderators, providing constant and ever-evolving guidance. They requested frequent updates about which topics were trending on the platforms and they recommended what kinds of content should be deemed false or misleading.\"\n\nTapper also coauthored this year's Original Sin, about the Biden White House's largely successful attempt to cover up the president's lack of cognitive functioning before the June 2024 debate with Trump made that impossible. \"Joe Biden and his inner circle did the country dirty,\" by hiding his mental decline, says Tapper, who suggests that the Democratic Party hasn't even started to process how such a debacle unfolded.\n\nTapper notes that Barack Obama was also guilty of trying to corral the press, citing attempts in 2009 to block Fox News' access to White House officials. \"I stood up when the Obama administration was saying that Fox was not a legitimate news organization, when they were declaring that from the White House podium,\" he says, noting that he still gets \"shit\" from liberals and progressives for defending Fox's access. \"Why is it appropriate for a White House to label a credentialed news organization not legitimate?\"\n\nBut Trump is in a whole other league when it comes to threatening the press, says Tapper. Lawsuits against ABC News, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and The Des Moines Register, among other outlets, are clear attempts to bring the watchdog press to heel, says Tapper. \n\nCBS's owner Paramount settled a suit over trivial edits to a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, he notes, adding that Trump has stopped heckling the Tiffany Network since it was purchased by Skydance, which is owned by the son of billionaire Larry Ellison, a major Trump donor. \"He always excludes CBS now, ever since the Ellisons took over,\" says Tapper. \"And he says, 'Larry Ellison is a good friend of mine.

Email natasha.anderson@dailymail.com \nBy NATASHA ANDERSON, SENIOR US NEWS REPORTER\n Published:16:06 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:16:18 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nA hardworking farmer on the verge of losing his home to Canada's indigenous tribes has vowed to fight back and 'protect my property.'\nLifelong Richmond resident Kal Mattu appeared before city leaders Tuesday night, outraged after learning his home could soon fall under Cowichan title.\n'I have owned my land for more than enough years to know what's mine. I'm not giving it up without a fight,' Mattu told Juno News at a Richmond town hall.\nThe British Columbia Supreme Court in August awarded the Cowichan Tribes an Aboriginal title over roughly 800 acres of land in the Vancouver suburb of Richmond.\nThe ruling further declared that private ownership by the federal government and city of Richmond would be 'defective and invalid.'\nMattu, who has lived in Richmond for 51 years and lives on his $1.6 million ($1.15 millions USD) blueberry farm, alleged the bank has now refused to renew his mortgage in wake of the ruling.\n'I paid taxes. I bought my place –– and low and behold, I don't own my place. It's not fair,' he said, adding that he feels as if he has been paying taxes for 'no reason at all.'\nHe added that he just wants to 'keep what I paid for', is pursuing legal action and believes homeowners should have been better represented during the legal process.\n\nHardworking farmer and lifelong Richmond resident Kal Mattu appeared before city leaders Tuesday night, outraged after learning his home could soon fall under Cowichan title\n\nMattu, who has lived in Richmond for 51 years, owns a farm in the impacted Triangle Rd area of Richmond. His property was valued at $1.6 million in 2023, Redfin records show\nThe August 2025 ruling, which followed what was billed the 'longest trial in Canada's history', awarded the Cowichans ownership of an area the tribes call the Lands of Tl'uqtinus. \nThe Lands of Tl'uqtinus refers to the traditional village site located along the Fraser River shoreline that was historically used for trade and fishing.\nThe area is currently home to private residents, small farms, a golf course and several industrial operations. It consists of land and buildings valued at more than $1.3billion, property analysts said.\nThe aboriginal title declaration was suspended for 18 months so that the tribes, federal government and city would have the 'opportunity to make the necessary arrangements.' \nBut locals are frustrated by the ruling and believe the city, its lawyers and leadership left them in the dark throughout the legal process.\nAction on the aboriginal title case commenced in March 2014 and the trial began in September 2019. Residents allege they only received formal notice about the case after BC Justice Barbara Fisher issued her ruling in August 2025.\n'You guys knew what was going on. Why did you not reach out to us?' Mattu asked Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie at Tuesday night's heated town hall, The Globe & Mail reported.\n'You're the mayor. You're supposed to know everything that's going on in Richmond. I pay my taxes to you. Why did you not reach out to us?'\n\nThe British Columbia Supreme Court awarded the Cowichan Tribes an Aboriginal title over roughly 800 acres of land in the city of Richmond (pictured), a suburb of Vancouver, in August\n\nMuch of the fallout from the controversy has been aimed at BC Supreme Court Justice Barbara Fisher, (pictured) who reportedly declined to notify affected landowners of the ramifications as the case was being heard\nBrodie and city solicitor Anthony Capuccinello Iraci claimed officials asked the court to notify affected homeowners, but the request was rejected.\nCapuccinello Iraci argued landowners suffered a 'tremendous injustice' and 'denial of fair process,' which he said will be highlighted in the city's appeal.\nSteven Lai, a Richmond homeowner with a million-dollar mortgage, organized a protest outside the town hall.\nAlthough Lai's home is not included in the Cowichan title area, he said the ruling has left him fearful and confused.\n'Could you imagine if I have spent half of my life working hard to pay my mortgage off, not to mention paying for the property taxes, and then only to find out that the property doesn't belong to me anymore?' he told Richmond News. \n'Why should I have spent so much time and money paying off the loans? This would be incredibly unfair to me.'\nAlthough Lai's property not located in the 800 acres awarded to the tribes, nearly all of British Columbia is unceded tribal land.\nThe Cowichan tribes have already filed an appeal claiming ownership of further land in the region, meaning his home could potentially be included in a future handover.\n\nHAPPENING NOW: Tensions flare at the Richmond, BC town hall as one lifelong resident says he’s been paying taxes “for no reason at all” after learning his property could fall under Cowichan title.\n\n“I bought the place — now I don’t own it. I’m not giving it up.” pic.twitter.com/N4rTsr9r0H— Juno News (@junonewscom) October 29, 2025\n\nThe British Columbia Supreme Court in August awarded the Cowichan Tribes an Aboriginal title over roughly 800 acres of land in the Vancouver suburb of Richmond. The Cowichan tribes have already filed an appeal claiming ownership of further land in the region\nMuch of the fallout from the controversy has been aimed at Justice Fisher, who reportedly declined to notify affected landowners of the ramifications as the case was being heard.\nFisher acknowledged the impact on those affected, but justified it by saying: 'Sometimes the hardship will be borne by Indigenous peoples and First Nations and sometimes it will be borne by non-Indigenous Canadians.'\nBut the lawyer representing the Cowichan tribes said his clients are not targeting private property and is allegedly 'frustrated and disappointed' with the 'misinformation' surrounding the ruling.\nAttorney David Rosenberg said the Cowichan 'stands with the land owners' and are empathic to them, Construct Connect reported.\nHe alleged the tribes are frustrated by 'inactivity' from the British Columbia government and claims officials need to 'negotiate honorably' with the Cowichan on how to reconcile private land that they have now been granted ownership of.\nRosenberg added that if the province negotiates in good faith, the 'likely outcome' will be a treaty that recognizes the aboriginal title and also allows private owners to hold fee-simple title.\nChiefs from the First Nations on Vancouver Island also released a statement to the Vancouver Sun on Monday, alleging the response to the aboriginal title is 'provoking unnecessary fear.'\n'We do not wish to deepen division. We are here to build a just future based on truth and reconciliation. One where British Columbia upholds its constitutional obligations,' Lyackson First Nation Chief Shana Thomas said.\n\nThe BC Supreme Court ruled that issues surrounding titles would need to be resolved through negotiation, litigation or purchase, otherwise the properties would remain under Cowichan title lands. Pictured is a Richmond home that could be affected by the ruling\n\nThe Lands of Tl'uqtinus is currently home to private residents, small farms, a golf course and several industrial operations. Pictured is the International Buddhist Temple in Richmond, BC\nChief Pam Jack of the Penelakut Tribe, echoing Thomas's remark, suggested that private land owners should direct their frustrations at the provincial government.\n'We welcome and anticipate supporting individual landowners making any respectful claims they may have against British Columbia,' Jack added. \nThe Cowichan tribes were displaced from the so-called Lands of Tl'uqtinus in the mid-1800s when the British colonized the area.\nBritish Columbia ultimately became a Canadian province and land in the historical Cowichen territory was sold over the years. \nThe tribes wanted to have ownership of the land returned to them, but did not seek for titles of privately held properties to be declared invalid.\nThe BC Supreme Court, however, ruled in August 2025 decision that granting private property ownership rights would 'unjustifiably infringe' on Cowichan Aboriginal title.\nThe court further ruled that issues surrounding titles would need to be resolved through negotiation, litigation or purchase, otherwise the properties would remain under Cowichan title lands.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHardworking farmer on verge of losing $1.6m home and business of 51 years after woke judge gave land to native tribe\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 140\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

But the 2024 presidential election saw a major shift, with a much higher proportion of Gen Z voters backing Trump. \n\nAccording to AP VoteCast, voters aged between 18 to 29 supported Kamala Harris over Trump by 51 percent to 47 percent in 2024. This margin was significantly narrower than in 2020, when former President Joe Biden carried the same age group by 61 percent to Trump’s 36 percent.\n\nIf this trend continues, it could prove pivotal for Republicans’ success in future elections.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on board Air Force One on Monday. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nThe YouGov/The Economist poll showed that white and male voters were the most likely groups to approve of Trump. Trump’s net approval rating among white people was around zero; among men is was just below zero; and among women it was just below -25 percentage points. \n\nTrump’s worst net approval rating was among young people at just above -50 percentage points, and among Black Americans at around -75 percent. \n\nTrump’s overall approval rating was -18 percent, the lowest it has been since his inauguration in January, and 1.3 points down since last week. The poll surveyed 1,623 people, and had a margin of error of 3.4 percent.\n\nThe latest poll reflects a continued loss of Trump’s support among Gen Z voters. A previous YouGov/Economist poll, conducted between October 17 and 20, found that just 25 percent of Gen Z respondents approved of Trump’s performance, while 67 percent disapproved — a net approval of –42 points.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nJohn B. Holbein, an associate professor of public policy and politics at the University of Virginia, told Newsweek: “Trump’s drop in youth support likely reflects a widening generational divide. Gen Z voters care deeply about issues like abortion rights, climate change, and the health of democracy: areas where Trump’s message simply doesn’t connect. His campaign often looks backward, while young voters are looking forward. Trump’s campaign messaging has focused more on grievance and nostalgia than on forward-looking themes that typically resonate with young voters.\n\n“If this shift holds, it could mark a durable generational realignment. Political habits formed in early adulthood tend to stick, and today’s young voters are the most diverse and socially liberal generation in U.S. history. That said, the political impact depends heavily on turnout and registration; young Americans are the least likely to show up at the ballot box, even when they strongly favor one side.”\n\nOwen Winter, a political data journalist for The Economist, wrote on X: “Donald Trump’s approval rating in our tracker has fallen to -18, the lowest it has ever been (lower than any point in his first term).”\n\nPatrick Webb, co-founder of The Leading Report, wrote on X: “Gen Z males are turning away from Donald Trump but aren’t aligning with the Democratic Party either, expressing frustration with both sides, per Atrioc.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nTrump’s favorability among different demographics is likely to fluctuate as his presidency progresses. The main test of his support will come when voters head to the polls for the midterm elections in November 2026.","summary":"Support for Donald Trump has seen a continued fall in recent months among young people, who were key in his success in 2024.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-gen-z-young-people-support-poll-rock-bottom-approval-rating-10957911","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2243241383.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 15:25:14","author":"Marni Rose McFall","authors":["Marni Rose McFall"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.331},{"id":373776792,"title":"Republican Could Flip New York for First Time in Two Decades—Poll","text":"Republicans could win the New York gubernatorial office for the first time in decades, according to a new poll that found GOP Representative Elise Stefanik with a lead over Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul and Lieutenant Governor Anthony Delgado.\n\nNewsweek reached out to Hochul’s and Delgado’s campaigns for comment via email.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nNew York is viewed as a reliably Democratic state. The liberal bastion of New York City, as well as other areas like Albany, Buffalo and Rochester, have kept it in the blue column for decades in most federal races.\n\nBut Republicans have made some inroads with some Empire State voters recently. Former Vice President Kamala Harris received less than 56 percent of the vote in New York last year, the weakest performance for a Democrat in decades. Next year’s gubernatorial race will be a key test of whether that was a potential signal that the state could be shifting toward competitiveness over the long run.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nHochul, who won her election in 2022 by a smaller-than-expected margin, is running for reelection next November. She is facing a primary challenge from Delgado, though early polling suggests she has an advantage among Democratic voters.\n\nOn the Republican side, Stefanik, who represents a northern New York congressional district, is considered a potential candidate. She has staked out a more moderate position on some issues throughout her career, but has also remained a steadfast supporter of President Donald Trump. She would be viewed as a top recruit for Republicans hoping to make the race competitive.\n\nA new poll released Tuesday by the Manhattan Institute, a conservative think tank, found Stefanik leading Hochul by one point (43 percent to 42 percent) and Delgado by six points (43 percent to 37 percent). \n\nThe poll surveyed 600 New York City voters and 300 New York State voters, weighted to account for population, from October 22 to October 26, 2025. It had a margin of error of ±3.3 percentage points.\n\nRepresentative Elise Stefanik speaks at the Republican National Convention on July 16, 2024, in Milwaukee.\n\nOther polling has shown Hochul with a lead, but some surveys have suggested it could be a close race.\n\nA Siena College poll of 802 likely voters from September 8 to September 10, 2025, showed Hochul up by 25 points (52 percent to 27 percent), with 17 percent undecided. It had a margin of error of ±4.2 percentage points.\n\nA GrayHouse poll found Hochul leading Stefanik by five points on an initial ballot (48 percent to 43 percent), but Stefanik led on an informed ballot (46.4 percent to 45.9 percent). It surveyed 1,2550 New York likely voters from September 20 to September 26, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points.\n\nDemocrats have controlled the New York governorship for decades. Governor George Pataki was the last Republican to hold the office, serving from 1995 to 2006.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nBernadette Breslin, a spokesperson for Stefanik, wrote in a press release: “This marks the first time in decades that any potential Republican gubernatorial candidate (and in this case, the likely nominee) is polling ahead of a Democrat incumbent Governor, even before any official announcement. \n\n“In a decision that she will come to regret, Kathy Hochul lives up to her title as the Worst Governor in America when she chose to bend the knee and put New Yorkers LAST by desperately endorsing the Defund the Police, tax hiking, raging Antisemite Socialist Zohran Mamdani who will destroy New York.”\n\nJournalist Alex Gault wrote on X: “The Manhattan Institute, which crafted this poll, is a known conservative thinktank. Notable that while two Republican-linked orgs show Stefanik ahead, the really independent pollster SCRI shows a completely different reality.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nForecasters still give Hochul an advantage—both the Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball classify the race as Likely Democratic. Stefanik has not formally said she plans to run. WPTZ, an NBC affiliate servicing the Burlington, Vermont–Plattsburgh, New York area, reported that she will announce her plans after the November elections.","summary":"A new poll of New York&#039;s gubernatorial race showed GOP Representative Elise Stefanik with a lead over Governor Kathy Hochul.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/republican-could-flip-new-york-first-time-two-decades-poll-10958916","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2162329710.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 15:23:32","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.363},{"id":373765366,"title":"Katy Perry's friend reveals why star was 'drawn' to 'strong' Justin Trudeau after Orlando Bloom heartbreak","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMultimillionaire car boot king's cleaner who was left his £43million estate wins battle to keep it after High Court victory against his son\n\nKeir Starmer REFUSES to rule out breaking Labour's manifesto pledge on tax rises as PM fuels fears of huge Budget raid on workers\n\nMigrant murdered restaurant owner in random stabbing attack because his asylum application was rejected\n\nSARAH VINE: The Andrew snowball thunders on, flattening all in its path...

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy HEIDI PARKER, US DEPUTY SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:15:09 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:15:10 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nHe's slick, handsome and powerful.\nBut what really attracted Katy Perry to Justin Trudeau was far more cosmic, the Daily Mail can reveal.\n'She's very into astrology,' a source told the Mail. 'Katy said he is a solid guy and she loves that he is an earth sign, a Capricorn.'\nThe pal added: 'She is a Scorpio, like a total typical Scorpio, so she is very driven and headstrong. So she likes having an earth sign as a boyfriend because it grounds her.'\nPerry, 41, went public with her new relationship with the ex-Canadian Prime Minister, 53, at the weekend during a date in Paris.\nThe singer split from ex-fiance Orlando Bloom — who is also a Capricorn — earlier this year and 'Katy had been looking for a strong, older man to date who is also high profile,' the friend said.\n'Justin is just the man for her. He fits her needs. She is thrilled,' added the source, who also noted she is 'happy' he's a politician and not another actor or musician — an apparent dig at Bloom.\n\nKaty Perry, 41, fell for Canadian politician Justin Trudeau , 53, for a very surprising reason, a source has told Daily Mail. There was a connection on a deeper level as well that has made their relationship 'intense'; seen during her birthday in Paris last week\n'Orlando is also a Capricorn, that is why she was drawn to him initially, she loves a good Cap,' noted the pal \nCapricorns are born between December 22 and January 19. \nThey are ruled by Saturn and are often characterized as being determined, practical, disciplined and hard-working.\nScorpios — whose birthdays are between October 23 to November 21 — are known for being passionate, intense, and loyal. \nThe sign's ruling planet is Mars. Capricorns are earth signs, while Scorpios are water — complementary elements said to bring emotional depth and stability to each other.\nPerry is said to be big into horoscopes and the super natural.\n'It's like every day that girl is on Astrology Zone (a popular horoscope website), she has fun with it,' said the friend. \nThe insider also noted that Perry is also into 'psychics, numerology, angel numbers, past life healers and Tarot cards.'\n'Katy believes in past lives and she thinks she and Justin may have intersected in some way in a past life,' said the pal. 'Why not?'\n\n'Katy said he is a solid guy and she loves that he is a earth sign, a Capricorn, she is very into astrology,' the pal noted. 'It's like every day that girl is on Astrology Zone, she has fun with it.' Seen in March\n\nAnd the balance works for the ex-fiancée of Orlando Bloom, who is also a Capricorn; seen on October 8 in NYC\nWhile their romance might be new, the insider noted the relationship is already serious.\n'There is no way she would go public with him unless it was a mega big deal,' the friend said.\n'Yes, it is a mega big deal with Justin. Katy is very in love with Justin.'\nAnd the couple are already planning to see more of each other next month while she continues her Lifetimes Tour.\n'She wants him to meet her in Paris and Barcelona for her tour stops next month so they can have a romantic time when she's not on stage,' the same source said.\nPerry will also be in Japan and the United Arab Emirates in December. \n\nAnd there are plans to see even more of each other next month while she continues her Lifetimes Tour. 'She wants him to meet her in Paris and Barcelona,' a source told Daily Mail; seen on October 24 in Paris\nPerry first teased romance with Trudeau earlier this month at a concert at London's The O2.\nA fan jokingly proposed to her at the show, and she laughed and said: 'I wish you'd asked me 48 hours ago.'\nShe also joked about no longer falling for English men. Speaking to her fans, she said: 'London, England, you're like this on a Monday night after a whole day at work and a whole day at school?\n'No wonder I fall for Englishmen all the time... but not anymore.'\nPerry was famously married to Brit Russell Brand — a Gemini — and has also dated John Mayer, Diplo and Robert Ackroyd, as well as actor Johnny Lewis.\nTrudeau served as the 23rd Prime Minister of Canada from 2015 until 2025, when he was ousted from office after a decade in power.\nTrudeau led the Liberal Party from 2013 until stepping down following his election defeat in 2025.\nHe was married to 50-year-old Sophie Grégoire — a Pisces — for 18 years before the pair separated in 2023.\n\nKATY PERRY'S TOUR SCHEDULE \n\nOctober 28 Kraków, Poland, Tauron Arena\nOctober 30 Prague, Czech Republic, O2 Arena\nOctober 31 Munich, Germany, Olympiahalle\nNovember 2 Casalecchio di Reno, Italy, Unipol Arena\nNovember 4 Paris, France, Accor Arena\nNovember 5 Paris, France, Accor Arena\nNovember 7 Décines-Charpieu, France, LDLC Arena\nNovember 9 Barcelona, Spain, Palau Sant Jordi\nNovember 11 Madrid, Spain, Movistar Arena\nNovember 21 Hangzhou, China, Olympic Expo Center\nNovember 22 Hangzhou, China, Olympic Expo Center\nNovember 24 Shanghai, China, Mercedes-Benz Arena\nNovember 25 Shanghai, China, Mercedes-Benz Arena\nNovember 26 Shanghai, China, Mercedes-Benz Arena\nNovember 29 Haikou, China, Wuyuan River Stadium\nDecember 3 Saitama, Japan, Saitama Super Arena\nDecember 7 Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, Etihad Park\nParisOrlando BloomKaty PerryJustin Trudeau\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nKaty Perry's friend reveals why star was 'drawn' to 'strong' Justin Trudeau after Orlando Bloom heartbreak\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Check all quotes against the audio for accuracy.\n\nNick Gillespie: Jake Tapper, thanks for talking to Reason.\n\nJake Tapper: It's great to be here. Thank you.\n\nThe new book is Race Against Terror: Chasing an Al-Qaeda Killer at the Dawn of the Forever War. We're going to talk about that. We're going to talk about Trump's attitudes toward the press. We're going to talk a little bit about Joe Biden. And have we actually digested the debacle that was the final months of the Joe Biden presidency?\n\nBut let's talk about Race Against Terror: Chasing an Al-Qaeda Killer at the Dawn of the Forever War. This takes us back 25 years almost—to 9/11, Afghanistan, and the beginning of what was called the global war on terror, the global war on terrorism. What brought you back to this topic? Because you've already written about Afghanistan.\n\nSo this story is the story of the one and only foreign terrorist that was brought to the U.S. to be tried in a criminal court for killing service members abroad.\n\nI first got interested in the story because I heard about it just randomly at my son's birthday party. One of the prosecutors was a fellow—and he told me the story. He said something about The Outpost, and I said, \"That book was really difficult to write because the military keeps bad records and they don't share them.\"\n\nHe said, \"Tell me about it.\" And then he proceeds to tell the story about how he had to prove—he and his colleagues had to prove a case—a criminal case, that would be upheld in court against a terrorist for actions on the battlefield that took place in 2003. And an attempt to blow up the U.S. embassy in Nigeria not long after that. And like all of the sleuthing and the detective work that they all had to do.\n\nIt was just this incredible story about all the stuff I love from police procedurals like CSI or Cold Case or whatever. How do you prove a case?\n\nAnd yeah, it reads—I mean, it's incredible—because the Al-Qaeda killer, who is known…I can't pronounce his actual Nigerian name, but he's known as Spin Ghul. He showed up in Italy. He was arrested by Italian authorities and was bragging to them, basically that, \"I killed American soldiers.\"\n\nYeah. Very proud of it. Very proud.\n\nYeah. But then they had to prove it, because that was his assertion, right?\n\nThey had to prove it because it was the Obama years, and Obama had closed off Gitmo from any new terrorist suspects. Obama wanted to try terrorists in criminal court. And that was really controversial at the time. People might not remember, but—Trump is trying to do it now. Spin Ghul was the first terrorist tried like this. Trump is trying to do it with a guy named Jafar. Not controversial at all—no hue and outcry. The guy is sitting—this terrorist is sitting in a cell not far from where you and I are sitting, in Virginia, and nobody's acting afraid about it.\n\nBut at the time, people acted as though these terrorists had superhuman powers, and if you brought them to Manhattan or Brooklyn, they would escape and wreak havoc.\n\nBut in any case, the sleuthing—what was so interesting to me about it because it was just proving a case that was not just cold. I mean nobody…people are generally not brought to court for killing people in a war. It just generally doesn't happen. So the sleuthing was so interesting.\n\nAnd then the subtext also became the different ways—and this wasn't intentional in terms of like, I wasn't trying to give a history of the war on terror—but you had to tell it. You had to describe what was different about Bush, to Obama, to Trump, because it was part of the hurdles that these prosecutors and FBI agents had to jump over.\n\nCan you explain that a little bit? Again, this is history worth recovering. A couple of weeks ago, I talked to Dan Krauss, who came out with a new documentary about Afghanistan called Bodyguard of Lies, and it again—you know, it's amazing. This is recent history, but it feels like a million years ago, and we've forgotten all the nuances.\n\nThe Bush administration—what was their approach to the war on terror, and particularly to military combatants—or noncombatants, but just suspected terrorists? How did they deal with people like that?\n\nWell, they basically set up an entirely new system of law. Now, they would argue that it was rooted in previous systems. But the idea is, these are not criminals, they're enemy combatants. Which is not the same as a prisoner of war, by the way. Prisoners of war have different rights. These are enemy combatants. We're going to send them to Guantanamo Bay. We are going to engage in enhanced interrogation—or what the rest of the world calls torture. We are going to engage in extraordinary rendition—or what the rest of the world calls kidnapping.\n\nAnd to give them the benefit of the doubt, they were thrown into this situation where America and the world are terrified because 3,000 Americans, almost, had been killed in this attack. And they feel like they can't deal with it in the normal system of criminal laws and justice. And so they create this other system.\n\nNow, that system proved problematic in many, many ways, as your readers and viewers and listeners know very well. One of them is, it didn't exactly endear the rest of the world to the United States.\n\nSo when I'm talking about—when I write in this period of 2011, and we're dealing with the Italian government—has this Al-Qaeda terrorist who claims he has killed Americans and tried to blow up the U.S. Embassy. The Italians are not just eager to hand him over to the Americans. I mean, they don't want him. They don't want to hold him. But they will not turn him over if he's going to Gitmo. They will not turn him over if he is going to a military tribunal. And they will not turn him over if the death penalty is on the table.\n\nAnd the Italians at this point are, by the way, kind of fed up. They have just prosecuted, successfully, a number of CIA agents in absentia, and military officers—American military officers—for kidnapping, for extraordinary rendition of an Egyptian cleric from the streets of Italy.\n\nNow we're in the Obama era, and Obama has what you might want to call a very aspirational notion of how this should be done. He thinks that the criminal courts are good enough. He doesn't follow through on that entirely, because he creates this Gitmo commission to examine everybody in Guantanamo Bay. Some people, he says, can go abroad to other prisons or other countries. Some people can be tried in criminal courts here in the United States. And then there's this third group that is largely still in Gitmo: people that are too dangerous to let go, but the evidence against them is too tainted for even a military tribunal.\n\nSo that's where Spin Ghul drops in, in the middle of all of this.\n\nYeah, so remind us a little bit, where were you in terms of things like putting a suspected terrorist in Gitmo without any kind of due process or any kind of military tribunals that the Red Cross or other organizations would send. Because Reason—you know, it was an interesting book to read because it's a thriller even though you know the outcome. But it was also—it reminded me, like, it was very…I'm not saying it's heroic in any way shape or form, but it was very uncomfortable. \n\nYou know what, like, torture and just picking people up off the streets and dropping them in kind of black sites where who knows who is torturing them, etc. Like to speak out against that was considered kind of anti-American at the time.\n\nYeah, it sure was. Look, Nick, I mean, one of the things I admire about you and the work you guys do is that it's never a good time to be—it's never a comfortable time to be a libertarian. Right?\n\nThere were 15 minutes in 2014 when it was looking to be quite a lot.\n\nAnd you know, being right in your own time is often uncomfortable. That should be your motto.\n\nBut yeah. I mean, the thing about the torture, in addition to the questions about whether or not it was effective to begin with, is that it created a whole bunch of situations where terrorists—criminals—could not be successfully put away.\n\nAnd one of the things that was interesting about this case was, since it started in 2011 during the Obama years, there was this effort to do everything by the book. \n\nBut it hadn't always been done that way.\n\nThere's this one chapter that was fun to write and interesting to write—it takes place in 2002. It is the capture of a terrorist accomplice named Abu Zubaydah, who was in Pakistan. The FBI is part of this, and they go in there. They seize Abu Zubaydah's stuff. Then the CIA takes over—John Kiriakou and others—and nothing having to do with Abu Zubaydah, who's still at Gitmo today, is ever usable again because it's so tainted. But the FBI was still doing things by the book, and the stuff that they had—there was some evidence there that was part of the trial against Spin Ghul.\n\nSo what the book—and I didn't, it's not a polemic; you can read it and like it; a progressive can read it and like it. Hugh Hewitt read it and said he thought this proves why military tribunals and Gitmo are the way to go. I didn't write it to be a political statement. It's just a thriller with political facts.\n\nBut I personally do think that like that stuff having to do with tainting evidence because of enhanced interrogation or torture makes us less safe. And the reason I think that is because if Spin Ghul had been captured during the Bush era, 2008, he probably would have been thrown in Gitmo. There would not have been this exhaustive, fascinating search for evidence against him. And then ultimately, probably—just if you look at the history of detainees at Gitmo—probably after 10 years somebody would have said, \"This guy doesn't belong here. We don't have any evidence against him. He's just some crazy guy who claimed he did all this stuff. We can't prove it.\" And he probably would have been sent to Niger, or Saudi Arabia, or Oman, or wherever. And then he probably would have gone and tried to kill as many Americans as he could. Because that was his purpose in life. I mean, no one's claiming these are good people.\n\nNo, no, no. I mean, one of the ironies that comes out in the book is that Spin Ghul himself was like, \"No! Treat me like an enemy combatant. I'm not a criminal. I am a terrorist. I am like hellfire from Allah to kill Americans. That's what I exist for.\" \n\nHe wanted to go to the Hague.\n\nHe was demanding that he talk to Ban Ki-moon and President Obama. He had a very grandiose view of himself, as zealots and people who commit violence in the name of extremism often do.\n\nThe ideological point of the book, it strikes me—which I agree with completely—is that ultimately this is a vindication of an approach to terrorism to say, \"We are going, as Americans, are going to follow the rule of law and due process, because that is a defining attribute of us.\"\n\nAnd it's a rejection of Bush-era policies—many of which I'm sure are still going on but are just not acknowledged by the government—where we do just torture people to tell us what we want to hear. That we put them in black sites. We have other countries or other people murder people, etc.\n\nIs it your argument, ultimately, that torture turns out not to be very good at getting information? That putting people in places like Gitmo really doesn't make us safer? We don't gain the information or we lose sight of these people? That we are in a better place, not just morally but also materially, by doing this kind of criminal prosecution?\n\nWell, I'm not taking a position per se on that. I mean, I think that it is very difficult to make a case for torture just in terms of results. Forgetting the morality of it all or the American ideals of it all. But I think it's very difficult to make the case for it in terms of results. I just think its difficult to say.\n\nNow, does that mean…I don't know that I would have done anything differently than Obama when it comes to the 15 guys who are still at Gitmo: too dangerous to release, and yet the evidence against them is too tainted to prosecute. So what do you do? I don't know.\n\nI do think that it is effective. I think that on Earth Two, where Spin Ghul is picked up in the Bush years, he's free and killing people. It doesn't spoil the book to say that Spin Ghul right now is in a supermax in Colorado. And he's, you know—but that said…\n\nSo this is the first terrorist ever tried in the court, the U.S. criminal court, for killing service members abroad. Trump is trying to do the second. This guy Jafar, who is responsible for the Abbey Gate bombing—or is part of…very statement-based. It's based on what he has confessed to. Before the FBI got hold of Jafar and brought him to this country, and there was no hue and outcry the way there was when the Obama years.\n\nWhich either suggests that we as a society have evolved—or that only Nixon can go to China, in terms of Trump and terrorism, I guess. But before that, he was in the hands of the Pakistanis.\n\nI wonder about that evidence against Jafar. Because it has been in previous cases—that you learn about when you read the book—it has evidence against these confessed terrorists has been thrown out because of whatever happened to them while they were under the duration of either the CIA at a black site or the Rwandan government or whatever.\n\nI am worried about the Jafar prosecution because the Trump Justice Department is winnowing their department—and the Eastern District of Virginia—of experts. People who know what they're doing, who know how to prove a case against a guy like this. These are not easy cases.\n\nAnd we're replacing… There was a guy in charge of the Jafar case—Michael Ben'Ary—who was fired for this ridiculous reason. Some MAGA person speculated that because he'd worked under Lisa Monaco at the Deputy Attorney General department, that he was part of the deep state or whatever. He got fired. He wrote a letter saying this weakens the case against Jafar.\n\nHow do you feel about Trump more broadly, in terms of things like the war on terror or foreign policy? Because the one thing we know for sure is that Bush's foreign policy was disastrous. Obama's was nothing to write home about. Trump and Biden kind of are different—I'm not saying they're the same thing—but clearly different.\n\nHave we evolved out of…are we really done with the \"global war on terror\" kind of era of foreign policy?\n\nI don't think it's done with us, is the bottom line. I mean, I think as long as there are dozens, hundreds, thousands—whatever—of radicalized Islamists who are willing to kill Americans and target Westerners, the war is not done with us.\n\nThere was an attack, an ISIS-inspired attack, by an American in New Orleans at New Year's this year. So I don't think we're done with it.\n\nI think Trump…he's a complicated guy and I have a lot of complicated feelings about his foreign policy. I mean, I think you can look at…There's a ceasefire in Gaza right now. That's empirically a good thing. People might not like what happened with the strikes against Iran's nuclear infrastructure, but I think the fact that they don't have it is a good thing.\n\nRight. And that he didn't follow it up. I mean, he was saying, \"This is something we're gonna do but we're not gonna stick around.\"\n\nYeah. \"We're not.\" That's it. \"We're dropping the bombs on their facilities, and then we're out.\" I mean, I think there's…to be cautiously optimistic about.\n\nI also think he's exercising a mix of hard power and soft power. His hard power is the threat of tariffs, the threat of force.\n\nBlowing up Venezuelan boats.\n\nWell, that's another question. So that's a different part of the war on terror powers.\n\nAnd this is something that you guys at Reason always know, which is like: Once a president establishes for himself that he has a shiny toy, good luck getting that toy ever wrested away from whoever the president is.\n\nBush used drones. Obama multiplied it by 100. And now Trump is using the same arguments to:\n\nA) label Antifa a domestic terrorist group—which I'm not sure he even has the power to do. And then\nB) use these powers to strike terrorists abroad, like going after al-Awlaki or whoever in Yemen.\n\nUsing those same powers and saying, \"We're going to use them against what we're calling narco-terrorists,\" because they're killing 100,000 Americans a year through fentanyl.\n\nWhich is not really—I mean, it's tragic—but it's not really the same thing as terrorists blowing up Americans in embassies. To say, \"We're selling drugs and Americans are overdosing on it.\"\n\nI don't shed a tear for any narco-terrorist dying, but like I don't know that it's sane.\n\nAnd as Rand Paul points out, when it comes to those strikes on these boats from Venezuela or Colombia or whatever—even if you're wrong only 25 percent of the time—that's 25 percent of the time you're killing innocent people. And also, there's no judicial process for this.\n\nSo I would say, ultimately, as with all presidents, I think it's a mixed bag. I do think it's a positive development that President Trump is using the criminal court system to prosecute Jafar. I don't know that they even remember that it was really controversial to do this in the Obama years.\n\nI had Seb Gorka on specifically to ask him—\n\nDr. Gorka on this podcast\n\nI apologize.\n\nI had Dr. Gorka on to ask him about this. And now that I know so much about this from The Race Against Terror book, I'm very intrigued by it. I don't think he even had…I don't know that he knew that this had been controversial back in 2011 or 2012.\n\nBut either way, I take it as a positive development that President Trump thinks we can use the criminal courts to prosecute foreign terrorists captured abroad. I think that's a good thing.\n\nYeah. And it is strange that Trump talked a lot actually in 2016—and certainly in 2024—\"I'm not doing regime change,\" even as now he and J.D. Vance are explicitly talking about regime change in Venezuela. So it's like there's something rhyming here, but it seems slightly better. You know, it's not totalizing like it was 20 years ago.\n\nYeah. TBD when it comes to the South America thing. Because I don't know how much of that is chest-thumping and how much of that is like… I mean, are they really—I can't see them ever sending ground troops anywhere.\n\nYou know that the U.S. and Latin America—or South America—have a terrible history. And hopefully, I thought we were past the military version of it. But that remains to be seen.\n\nIf we can, let's talk about Trump domestically. It's only been about a month since Brendan Carr, Trump's FCC chair—as well as Trump himself—explicitly said that Jimmy Kimmel, basically, that Disney and ABC should fire Jimmy Kimmel because airing him is not in the public interest. A lot of things along those lines.\n\nAnd again, this is something else. I mean, that's a month ago, but it seems like it was a decade ago. Almost, right?\n\nAnd you were very forceful in saying that, in your mind, this was the most direct threat to a free press that you've seen in your lifetime. Do you stand by that? And how are you thinking about it now, a month on?\n\nI absolutely stand by it.\n\nLook, there have been a lot of egregious examples. I don't like what the Biden administration did with social media companies—a lot of it was confirmed years later. But in terms of… I mean, there's a difference between…They used a very slippery slope—which is always the argument—which is, if you say, \"Don't put this on the internet because it's going to hurt people,\" and the social media companies comply, we're in the middle of a once-in-a-century pandemic, etc., etc. Then the next thing they're gonna do is start removing stuff that is just politically untenable, like the lab leak theory, which to me is still insane.\n\nLook, I get that there's anti-Asian hate crime out there, and that's horrific and obviously should be condemned. But I think most Americans are capable of having a conversation about the Chinese government as a force for evil or ill—versus people of Asian descent, or even Chinese citizens.\n\nSo I found a lot of it really, really troubling.\n\nBut the argument that—I mean, I stood up when the Obama administration was saying that Fox was not a legitimate news organization, when they were declaring that from the White House podium. I said—and I got a lot of shit for it, and I still get shit for it to this day—\"Why is it appropriate for a White House to label a credentialed news organization not legitimate?\"\n\nThis having nothing to do with my feelings about Fox. My feelings about Fox are irrelevant, really. First of all, in 2009, that was a very different Fox than what we have now. And second of all, it's a question about why is it appropriate for the White House to do this. So I do have a history of this.\n\nI will say that this was the most direct. Brendan Carr goes on the podcast of a MAGA right-wing person and says, \"I don't like this speech, and Disney should act. And the local affiliates that air this quote-unquote garbage should stop airing it.\"\n\nWhich was followed by the largest owner of local TV stations, Nexstar—which needs Brendan Carr for some business transactions they want to do. Not just approval, but to lift a limit on how many households they can reach. They need Brendan Carr. And it was basically, \"Aye aye, sir, how high do you want us to jump?\" And they did that.\n\nAnd it was awful.\n\nI have not seen ever before a direct infringement on the right to free speech like that before ever.\n\nI think we both might be—thankfully, we're not very young anymore—but we're too young for LBJ and whatnot. But yeah, this is…\n\nI mean, I wrote a piece for The Free Press: \"Abolish the FCC,\" in the wake of this. Partly because there is no reason, I think, why the government or a group called the FCC should have the ability to license content in any way, shape, or form. I realize that is an outlier position, but…\n\nDo you feel like this threat—this most recent threat—plus the lawsuit that Trump is bringing against CBS, and he's done against other broadcasts or other news organizations… is it actually having a chilling effect? Or are people developing a backbone in the regulated media to push back?\n\nWell, both is the answer.\n\nI think the Trump assertions of… Look, anybody has the right to sue anybody in this country. And corporations don't have to acquiesce if they don't want to.\n\nOne of the things that's troubling is that this is coming at the same time that, for want of a better term, the oligarchs are out oligarching. And they are very susceptible to what one CBS News employee called \"legalized bribery,\" to me.\n\nAnd look, the lawsuit against CBS News was absolute nonsense. The idea that CBS, in making an edit like that, was defaming President Trump in any way… it was an edit to a Kamala Harris interview. And yeah, she spoke in word salads. They took one clip and used it, and they took another clip and used it.\n\nAnd as you showed on CNN, on your show, that Fox News had done the same thing for Donald Trump. None of this rises to the level of even notice, much less legal action.\n\nYeah. Look, I'm not crazy about taped interviews to begin with, because I think people get lazy in terms of the talkers—they're not concise. They're long.\n\nBut generally speaking, most of the time, no every time, that we're trying to edit an interview we're just trying to save time. \"Ok, here's this 20 minutes of whatever. Can we find like a minute that answers the question?\" Because that's the business here.\n\nAnd that's what 60 Minutes was doing. That lawsuit was nonsense. And the only reason, in my view, that it was settled was because Shari Redstone wanted this merger to go through. She wanted Brendan Carr….\n\nAnd in the middle of this, Colbert gets fired. And while you can make the argument that there is an economic issue when it comes to late night in general—including Colbert's show—announcing it then? There's no reason for it, other than to announce it so as to please Trump and Brendan Carr.\n\nThere's no other reason to announce it then just in terms of television. You would announce it on your own terms after the New Year or something like that. The only reason to do it during this merger week was to please Trump.\n\nThe Stephanopoulos interview is a different thing, because I also suspect there was a lot of discovery that nobody wants all their emails and text messages turned over.\n\nBut that said, now President Trump is using this stuff to argue that he's constantly defamed, that he's consistently attacked by the media unfairly. And it's not true. I mean, I see stuff about him that's not fair, of course. Yeah. So I think there is a chilling effect.\n\nWhat are you worried about? What comes next? What does the White House do next to turn the pressure up even higher?\n\nWell, I mean, they're already doing it to CBS News.\n\nThere's already… I mean, Bari Weiss—who I like and have only the highest hopes for, and I don't think is… Look, I think legacy media—Nick, you and I have been talking about this for a long time—I think the legacy media has work to do. Absolutely. In terms of credibility, in terms of inclusivity of voices. Not just from the right, by the way, but also libertarians, independents, and all the rest.\n\nBut I mean, the degree to which it feels as though President Trump feels very empowered… He only insults NBC and ABC when he talks about networks. He always excludes CBS now, ever since the Ellisons took over. And he says, \"Larry Ellison is a good friend of mine. He's a good guy, blah blah blah. They're gonna make it fair, da da da da.\"\n\nWhich, you know, that's not how presidents should be talking about people who cover them. Presidents in general should think we're all pains in the ass. Every president. About every news outlet.\n\nWell, we're also talking about a president who—and I'm jumping ahead now a little bit—but we're talking about a president who, in response to the No Kings rallies or marches, released an AI video where he is wearing a crown and literally dumped shit on protesters.\n\nSo we're talking about a different president. Now, what does the media do to push back against this in any kind of meaningful way?\n\nWell, I think, first of all, we have an obligation to point out that…\n\nYou know, when Hillary Clinton referred to half of Trump supporters in 2016 as fitting in a \"basket of deplorables,\" or when Joe Biden said what he said about Donald Trump's supporters being \"garbage\" or whatever he said—I know that's disputed. Those were considered gaffes.\n\nThose were, you know, as Michael Kinsley's famous saying that, \"a gaffe is when a politician accidentally tells the truth.\" But those were accidents. Those were mistakes. Them accidentally revealing what they really think about millions of Americans.\n\nBut here's Donald Trump, in a strategic way, showing himself dropping shit not on MS-13 gang members, not on Antifa rioters, but on Americans demonstrating peacefully. The No Kings rallies were peaceful—largely, as far as I know.\n\nThey were virtually completely peaceful, yeah.\n\nYeah. And certainly the ones in the AI were that. If you look closely, you can see he's dropping shit on a woman holding a baby. He's dropping shit on an American flag.\n\nSo I think it's incumbent upon us to cover the president—including when he does things like that. We don't have to use adjectives. Just use verbs.\n\nThis is the president…as a strategy, attacking millions of Americans and dividing the country. That is what he is doing.\n\nAnd then you ask people for their opinions on it. But I think we can't shy away from covering it.\n\nBut at the same time, it's not for us in the news media—unless you're an opinion journalist—to say how you feel about it. You just state the facts of it and let opinion people talk about it.\n\nAnd also, we have to cover everything else he's doing, whether you like it or not: tariffs, Mideast peace. There's a lot going on.\n\nDo you—David Ellison, who installed Barry Weiss—and I should say I'm friends with Barry; I write for The Free Press from time to time—installed her as the editor in chief at CBS News. He's also rumored to be talking about buying CNN. Puck and others have said that if he does that, he's going to extend her role to CNN.\n\nHow would you feel about Barry Weiss being the head of CNN's operation?\n\nI only know her personally. I don't know her professionally, so I can't really say.\n\nI read The Free Press. I subscribe to The Free Press, as you know—as one of many places I read. \n\nYeah, of course.\n\nI read Reason. I read you know, whatever. I read a lot. And I try to read as many perspectives that I don't think automatically or what I knee-jerk think.\n\nAnd you know, sometimes I like it, sometimes I don't. Just like every publication I read.\n\nI don't know. I mean, I suspect it would be fine. I mean I look at legacy media, and I see flaws. And I think there are flaws that need to be fixed.\n\nWhat are the biggest flaws—and you're considering CNN should be considered legacy media, even though it's the original cable show. Fox News is legacy media at this point. \n\nWhat's the big failing of legacy media right now, do you think?\n\nWell, look. I mean, Fox has its own issues, right?\n\nI don't think I'm spilling any secrets when I say they are commodifying preaching to the choir. That is a channel for Trump supporters—not for conservatives, not for Republicans. It is for Trump's supporters.\n\nVery seldom—although there is that one woman on Outnumbered—very seldom are there voices that are allowed to criticize Donald Trump or even question what he's doing. Period. Full stop.\n\nThere is another channel on cable that is the exact mirror image of that, and that is commodifying ideology. And that's fine. I think that's a fine supplement for a news diet. I don't think it's a news diet.\n\nIdeological media has been part of this country since it was founded.\n\nI think legacy media, as a general rule—and this is difficult to do in an era of cost-cutting, etc.—but I think we should be doing more stories outside the Delta Shuttle corridor and Los Angeles. I think we need to be covering the heartland more.\n\nLike, if I had unlimited funds and I were running any network—CNN, let's say—I would have a big office in Kansas City.\n\nCould you move—I mean, you film out of D.C.—would you move? Even to Philadelphia would be…I mean, it's in the Acela corridor, but that would be radically different, wouldn't it?\n\nI mean, yes. I think that you would want to go to—I don't know that I would.\n\nLook, I mean, it's such an interesting question because when CNN was founded, it was founded in Atlanta. And that was done purposely. And I don't know that that made CNN different ideologically than any other network.\n\nBut I think there should be more voices from all over the country included in coverage. And I do think that the biggest bias is often story selection. It's not necessarily in coverage. It's: Are we covering this? Are we covering that?\n\nAnd I just think ideologically, we need to expand our aperture in terms of what we think is news. And I don't only mean issues that conservatives are interested in or libertarians are interested in. But I'm also interested in: Are we covering the opioid crisis enough? Are we covering poverty in America enough?\n\nI just think there are all sorts of things we should…we could be doing better. And that's what I would do.\n\nBut the problem is—one of the problems is—this is happening at a time of media consolidation. It's happening at a time of oligarchs taking over news media. And it's also happening at a time where there is this commodification of rage-bait, of making people hate each other.\n\nAnd I don't just mean Fox or MS. I also mean social media driving people away from each other. Villainizing each other.\n\nHow does it hurt?\n\nCNN as a network has flat-to-falling ratings. The cable system writ large seems to be fading. I think most networks had peak years in 2020 for a variety of reasons that are probably not going to come back anytime soon.\n\nCable as a distribution mechanism is dying. I mean, C-SPAN, of all things, has to come up with a radically new business model because not enough people subscribe to cable anymore.\n\nHow much of it is that when industries are kind of sunsetting, they don't actually experiment, they don't do something new—they just kind of double and triple down on what has brought them to decline in the first place?\n\nWell, look—we are in…\n\nFirst of all, I think everyone's ratings are going down. Including Fox.\n\nYeah, yeah. Absolutely.\n\nThey're just losing viewers at a slower rate than others.\n\nOr they have a bigger audience, but it's down from where it was a year ago—and 4 or 5 years ago, for sure.\n\nCable is…the cord-cutting is a real thing. But it's not just the cord-cutting.\n\nThere is just a plate tectonic shift in how we are all, as individuals, consuming information.\n\nSo, I've written eight books now, and the difference between how much people factor in e-books and audiobooks today is light-years away from just 2 years ago. There is a recognition now that people are listening to books and reading them on their phones in a way that just a few years ago people did not recognize—they were only looking at hardcover.\n\nIt's everything. It's entertainment. It's news. It's movies. It's everything. And everybody's trying to figure out how to do it.\n\nI don't know what the future is. I know that Mark Thompson, who is our boss at CNN, he helped The New York Times get from a newspaper with a website to a website with a newspaper.\n\nOr a game company with a newspaper, right?\n\nA game and recipe company with a newsletter. Hey, I play those games every day.\n\nYou know, it's interesting because your—was your first book, or one of your first books, about Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura?\n\nThat was the first one, yeah.\n\nAnd this is going back—you started kind of in a big way… I mean, you were at Philadelphia magazine, if I'm remembering correctly, but at Salon, which is still soldiering on and things like that.\n\nIs the decline of the networks—legacy or otherwise—is that being supplanted by another kind of rush toward independent journalism or alternative journalism? Or is it just that credibility among media people everywhere is kind of fatal?\n\nI don't know where it's going to land.\n\nI mean, people can say, \"Compare the ratings for, let's say, CBS Evening News with Joe Rogan.\" Well, they're not doing the same thing, right?\n\nPeople might be getting information from both of them, but they're not doing the same thing. So I don't think that's a fair comparison. But I do think—and I'm not belittling Rogan—he's created this giant empire based on long-form, authentic conversations.\n\nBut he's not calling himself an expert on anything. And these aren't news reports.\n\nI just think we, as reporters, need to figure out how to get in that space where viewers are.\n\nPublishing has figured it out, in the sense of audiobooks and Kindle books. That's how…basically that's how I consume books now. I'm listening to them in my car and then I'm reading them on my phone.\n\nSo how do we get there? I don't know. CNN has been doing a lot more in terms of the vertical video space. And that's different, right?\n\nPeople don't want a highly produced news report in that space. They want—or they seem to want—a much more authentic, produced but Instagram or TikTok-friendly presentation of information in under three minutes.\n\nSo I don't know. We're all just trying to figure this out.\n\nYeah, I mean, and it's interesting to see the experimentation. I know even at Reason, we started our video site in late 2007, and our signature were long-form documentaries and interview programs.\n\nWe are now…our biggest successes with short-form, info-rich vertical videos. So there's actual information, reporting, and things like that.\n\nBut does it feel like—you know, you may be one of a dying breed, right? Where you are an old-style newsman. You have a politics, but it's subsidiary to the journalism that you're doing.\n\nDo you think your days as a kind of, you know, Wolf Blitzer–type voice of authority—are those days numbered?\n\nI don't think so. Because I think there will always be a need for somebody who is not a Democrat, not a Republican, who is able to moderate debates. Who is able to perform—or provide, rather—a news service and accounting of the day.\n\nWho can have on Speaker Johnson, who can have on Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader. I think there's always going to be a need for that.\n\nI don't know the format for that in 5 years, 10 years.\n\nWhile you and I are both having success in these short vertical videos—CNN and Reason—there is also simultaneously—and this is fascinating—this explosion of these incredibly long-form podcasts or YouTube podcasts. Hour-long conversations. Three-hour-long conversations, in the case of Joe Rogan, sometimes. Right?\n\nSo, I don't know where this lands. I just know that I think we, as you note, need to experiment, need to get out there, need to try stuff. Hue closely to the brand of nonpartisan, nonideological, trying to get information.\n\nYeah, you stand up for facts. And yeah, you stand up for democracy. But as a general note, I'm not saying that like this politician is better than that politician. I just think we're all trying to figure out how to get there.\n\nI don't see any news organizations, by the way—in terms of legacy media—knocking the cover off the ball in terms of getting to that place.\n\nSo I think there is an opening.\n\nCNN is gonna launch a streaming service. I hope that we are able to get in that space. And I hope people, you know…\n\nWhat happened to CNN+? Because you guys—you took a swing at this, right? That lasted, what, a week or something?\n\nYeah, that didn't really…\n\nSo what happened was—that was an attempt by the previous regime—Jeff Zucker and his team—to get into the streaming space. And there were other shows that were non-normal, like me having a book club, or Anderson having a parenting show.\n\nBut my book club was honestly just for CNN. No one's covered it this way, but that was us trying to get into the book space. Like, right now—although it's changing a little bit—but right now, the book space is 60 Minutes and CBS Sunday Morning, and then you go on Colbert, and maybe you do Today Show or whatever.\n\nAnd it was us trying to get into the book space by offering a half hour to 45 minutes with the author. It was a way for us to try to get in early on that stuff.\n\nBut in any case, what happened was that happened right around the time Discovery took over. That it became Warner Bros. Discovery. And they came in, and they had a lot of debt, and they had this huge expense that three weeks into it, or whatever it was, had not caught fire. And most things take years to build. \n\nAnd it was killed.\n\nIt's interesting because Fox also—I mean, Fox has Fox Nation—but it does not seem to be particularly robust. What, in the new CNN streaming service, are the types of things you'll be doing for that?\n\nWell, I think my show is going to be on it. And then I have a bunch of ideas of stuff I want to do for them once it's off the ground.\n\nBut right now, I've been told that since The Lead is going to be one of the shows on the streaming, just to focus on The Lead. And I'm talking to them right now about other stuff I could do that would be value-added.\n\nAnd in terms of the long-form interview space—where there is this ability, whether it's on streaming or podcasts or whatever—to do a long interview with somebody who's a newsmaker that they might find appealing.\n\nIf you're canoeing with Nick Gillespie—I mean, maybe somebody would watch that. I don't know.\n\nYeah, I don't think anybody wants to see that. And I don't blame them for that.\n\nBut it is true. I mean, one of the great things about long-form possibilities, which are easier to do now that we're freed from, you know, network kind of patterns or templates or whatever—is that people run out of bullshit to say. Right?\n\nWhat I mean is, if you're talking to somebody like Mike Johnson, and he's got to do a second take at a topic, it's probably going to be less hype and more, hopefully, thoughtful or thoughtless in a way.\n\nWell, you tell me, because you do this. Do you think…? I mean, most libertarian politicians are pretty candid, so I don't know. I don't know what it would be like. It would be interesting.\n\nI would be interested to see—like, if I go, I'm just making this all up, Ok? But if I got oyster fishing with Mike Johnson in Louisiana, right? Is he less inclined to talk like a speaker on TV if he's, you know, knee-deep in a bayou? I mean, like, I don't know.\n\nOne of the things I think everybody wants out there—or it seems to be, at least, based on viewing patterns in the new media is authenticity. \"This is actually what this person thinks.\" Now, they might be nuts and they might be wrong, but they're getting millions of viewers.\n\nI think… The way I think about it is…it's interesting that his career seems to be mostly over now—but Howard Stern, going back to the '80s… his genius was that people—celebrities or other public figures—were coming on, and they would have three or four talking points. And he would have them hurry through those, and then ask, \"Keep talking,\" and they would say something unguarded.\n\nAnd that was authentic. It was interesting. It was often embarrassing or humiliating or illuminating. And I mean, I think that's the hope. Like, I don't want to see Mike Johnson for 30 seconds, because I can figure out what he's going to say. But maybe in the second or the last 10 minutes of an hour-long interview, he might actually get around to saying what he really thinks. And that matters.\n\nHoward is such an interesting character or case study. Because he also makes it look easy because he's done a lot of research. He knows a lot about the people and he's asking them about obscure…\n\nLike, there's this famous fight that took place in the early days of SNL, when Chevy Chase and Bill Murray got into a fight. I forget who broke it up—it was like Billy Joel. It was this very unlikely group that broke it up.\n\nThere's a video going around of each one of those individuals, at a different point in the last 20 years, being asked about it by Howard. And it's really just illuminating and interesting.\n\nHoward's ability to attract guests, and also to go long—which means you're likely going to start getting some good stuff at some point, unless the person's a complete dud. And also to have information and know what's interesting, is really unparalleled. There's no one else doing it.\n\nI mean, Charlie Rose was doing a version of it for a while before his troubles. But there really isn't anything that's replaced it. I mean, the guy from Inside the Acting Studio was doing it for a little while.\n\nRight. James Lipton. And Bill Maher sometimes does a version of it in his podcast before it devolves into kind of high, drunken chatter.\n\nBut I think it's also partly if you're a fan, you want to ask these people the questions that fans have, as opposed to, \"I am a very serious person. Let's talk about very serious things.\"\n\nYeah. Club Random—is Club Random still going on? \n\nI thought he said he was going to…maybe I misunderstood. I thought they weren't going to do it anymore or something. But like no, Club Random's really good.\n\nBut it also, you know, then you need somebody to curate it afterward. Because I don't have eight hours a day to listen to podcasts. I want somebody afterwards to clean it up.\n\nLet me ask you about—I guess it was earlier this year, right? You published a book about Biden…\n\nOriginal Sin, in May, with Alex Thompson.\n\nAnd what was stunning to me—it's a fascinating book—you took a huge amount of shit for it. Because it's like, \"Why weren't you doing this in real time?\" Can you explain that a little bit? Like, at what point did you think it became a kind of journalistic imperative to say, \"You know what? This guy, he's not there anymore.\"\n\nI mean, I, along with everybody else in the mainstream media—in the legacy media—knew that when he took office, he was older and showing signs of age.\n\nI didn't see huge evidence of acuity issues until…you know, 2023, maybe. And even then, you'd ask people what's going on and they'd insist—\n\nI mean, look. People in the White House were lying. Not just to not just journalists, but they were lying to Democrats.\n\nOh, they were lying to themselves, I'm sure, as well.\n\nI think that's right.\n\nAnd I would see weird moments, but it wasn't… Look, I had the same reaction to the debate that everybody else did. I just had a better view of it, which is this guy cannot form a coherent sentence.\n\nHe's there to show he's up to the task, and he's proving the exact opposite. He can't even articulate a vision for the country, or even argue why he should be entrusted with the most powerful job in the world.\n\nSo, I mean, I would say, look—I wish I had… I can look back and say I wish I'd done more reporting on it. But I will also say the people that were writing about it were doing good journalism.\n\nAnd I include my co-author Alex. You know, some other people wrote commentary pieces. That's a little different.\n\nBut in terms of journalism—from The Wall Street Journal, they did it in June. There wasn't a ton of investigative work being done about what was going on behind the scenes, because people were not talking.\n\nI mean, conservatives were making fun of Biden as old and slow and this and that. But there wasn't any investigative work that was like, \"And here's the smoking gun.\"\n\nDo you think we've processed it as a country?\n\nBecause the Trump presidency—like winning—I'm not saying he shouldn't have won or didn't win in 2016, but it was such a weird thing that nobody saw coming. That's a lot to process.\n\nAnd then he governed kind of as a centrist Republican, really, that first term around. You could—there are issues—but he wasn't the way he is now.\n\nBut then Biden—that is another giant thing to digest. The idea that you're like, \"Oh my God, this guy is out of it. When did this start? It's unmistakable. It's unavoidable.\"\n\nAnd now we don't talk about it anymore.\n\n The other thing that's a huge wrinkle in the whole thing about when we look back on it—is that, I think it was February or March or April, I forget the exact date. But his last State of the Union address—Biden's—it was good. It was fine.\n\nAnd he actually had moments of playing off the crowd and whatever. I think that did a lot to shut people up. Because remember, that came after the Hur report. The Hur report came out in which Hur accurately described Biden as seeming like a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory. And got an untold amount of shit for it.\n\nAnd then he did the State of the Union, Biden, and he seemed fine. Old, but fine.\n\nAnd then came the debate.\n\nI don't know about the American people. I think that the Democratic Party has yet to reckon with this. I think that the progressives—no, it's not the progressives—it's the Democrats, the Democratic base. It's not the progressive base. The progressive base saw what happened because they never loved Joe Biden to begin with.\n\nAnd they recognize it as an opportunity for them to kind of move into a more powerful position within the party, I think.\n\nThat's probably true. Although, Joe Biden was probably the most progressive president.\n\n Absolutely. The Washington Post called him the most liberal candidate the Democrats have ever run for the presidency, and I think that was accurate going in, but—\n\nThat's true in 2024—not in 2020.\n\nIn 2020, he was kind of like \"Centrist Joe,\" which is who he was his entire career. But then, to unite the party, they agreed to take on all this stuff. And then, because I think he wasn't really paying attention—because he didn't have the wherewithal—he just outsourced the border to the activist wing of his party.\n\nI think that the degree to which Democrat voters have yet to reckon with the fact that they were lied to by Democratic officials. and the reluctance of Democratic officials to reckon with the fact that Joe Biden and his inner circle did the country dirty and did the Democratic Party dirty. \n\nI think that's still a problem.\n\nAnd I think it's one of the reasons why Democratic approval ratings are still so low. Who knows what's going to happen in the midterms? But I don't think they're doing themselves any favors.\n\nAnd I see it online all the time, still. Just this reaction like, there's this obliviousness. It's not just online; it's on MSNBC and elsewhere. This idea that there was nothing wrong. Everything was fine with Joe Biden. Everything was great with him.\n\nAnd it's like, what planet are you on? Go watch a video of him from the fall of 2024.\n\nKamala Harris writes in her book that it was reckless to make that decision without more input. And that he was not up to the task of running for president in 2024. I'm paraphrasing, but she says something like that.\n\nShe's talking about how she had to go and do a lot of the campaigning he was not capable of doing. That's a real problem.\n\nAnd I have yet to see anyone other than Kamala Harris even reckon with it—just a little bit—in terms of the 2028ers, the potential candidates.\n\nWith Trump—because Trump is now what 79—he, of course, has a clean bill of health, and he is the strongest president of all time. And he's doing math quicker than he did when he was a teenager, and all of that…\n\nI go back to that AI video. If that was my father or grandfather, I would be like, \"Dad, you know you can't drive the car anymore. Like, what the fuck is wrong with you?\"\n\nShould we be looking at Donald Trump for the same kind of senility that seemed to overtake Biden? Or are we kind of captive to that \"This is just Donald Trump\"? There's nothing he can do or say that isn't just the character he was in 1990 or 2000 or 2016.\n\n The truth is: I don't know.\n\nI mean obviously he's always been a pugilist. And obviously, he has not exactly run on uniting the country. He likes to attack people. He likes to attack the media and Democrats. And, as we saw by the AI video, millions of Americans.\n\nI'm really going to have a difficult time taking seriously the next time some Democrat says something that's vaguely insulting to Republican voters. I'm really going to have a tough time taking seriously anybody just, like, clutching their pearls.\n\nBecause this is Trump literally dropping shit on people peacefully demonstrating in this AI video. I'm not offended by it. But don't pretend you're offended by \"deplorables\" if you're not offended by that.\n\nBut beyond that, like sure. We should be keeping an eye out.\n\nWe cover this stuff all the time. I mean, the question is, when Donald Trump says that he warned the country about bin Laden a year before 9/11 and it's in his book—he can't even remember the title of the book—is that something to do with acuity? Or is that just him, as he always does, lying? Saying things that aren't true?\n\nI don't know. I'm not a doctor. I mean he was doing that sort of thing before, when he was in his 60s.\n\nRemember, he had the whole thing about Muslims dancing in the streets of New Jersey after 9/11? Never happened. Never happened. No evidence it ever happened.\n\nWhat are the things that the Trump administration is doing now that you don't think are getting enough attention, either good or bad?\n\nSo I think the way they're hollowing out experts from the Justice Department and the FBI is bad.\n\nOne of the things I've learned from writing this book is how important it is—if you want to put terrorists away forever—how important it is to have really good prosecutors who know what they're doing. And really good supervision of those prosecutors.\n\nAnd they're firing them for nakedly political reasons.\n\nThere's a guy in the book named George Toscas—one of the toughest guys in the National Security Division of the Justice Department. There since '93. Just an incredible… You had to get everything through him before you could get it to the attorney general or the president—indictments, extraditions. And he's been sidelined because he approved the Mar-a-Lago classified documents warrant.\n\nThe guy in charge of the Jafar case in the Eastern District of Virginia—fired because some MAGA person hypothesized that he was against the Comey indictments, which he wasn't.\n\nWe're getting rid of really good people who are there to protect us.\n\nThat concerns me a lot in the national security space.\n\nI was covering it a lot—like, every day—and we're not doing it as much. And I want to get back to it.\n\nThe effect of tariffs on small businesses is really important. I think we are covering the Mideast peace achievements—such as it is right now. We're covering it plenty, but I think that's important and significant.\n\nAnother thing that I think is important, that we're not covering enough, is and, we'll see what the effects will be—but the cuts to Medicaid. Is it reform? That's what Speaker Johnson says: \"It's reform to Medicaid. We're just making able-bodied men have to work,\" etc., etc.\n\nOr is it going to actually hurt people?\n\nThat's to be determined because it's just starting to happen now.\n\nBut all of that, I think, is important.\n\nWhat about you? What do you think?\n\nI don't—this is… I'm running. I own this microphone, Jake Tapper.\n\nWell, I'll say one other thing that I want to know more about—and people are doing investigative journalism about it. The Times has done it, we've covered it on my show, but it's really tough.\n\nAll the money that the Trump boys are making with this crypto venture makes Hunter Biden look like a Boy Scout. Right? I mean, this is some real—\n\nWhich is an achievement, right? To make people think like, \"You know, Hunter Biden was not really corrupt or a horrible human being. Kind of a good artist, really, when you think about it\" compared to the various scams that are going on.\n\nThe naked shakedowns that are happening—both in the Trump family industries, but also out of the Trump White House in the name of the government. I mean that's something that concerns me a huge amount.\n\nLike, the idea that Intel or Nvidia or other companies have to cough up a certain amount of revenue in order to do business, to get golden shares in companies and things like that.\n\nThis is deeply disturbing, because the MAGA state capitalism and a kind of progressive industrial policy—it's not a horseshoe anymore. It is forming a kind of solid ring now. \n\nAnd that troubles me.\n\nI would also say that when our Founding Fathers set up this system of checks and balances—that I think you and I agree, Nick, is like no other, and is a beautiful thing, and one of the geniuses of America. I don't know if they thought that the Congress, as opposed to the Continental Congress, was going to be populated by the Madisons and Jeffersons and…\n\nI was going to say Adams, but I hate Adams.\n\nBut by that type of people. And then you look at the Congress, and you look at who's in there, and you think, like, I mean this makes Harrisburg look like the Algonquin.\n\nYeah, it's amazing. Like ancient Greece or something like that.\n\nWith very few exceptions—and I'm not only talking about Republicans, because Democrats did not bathe themselves in glory during the Biden years when it came to standing up and saying, \"What the hell is going on here?\"\n\nBut with very few exceptions, they seem entirely concerned about their own reelection possibilities and nothing else. Nothing else.\n\nThere are a few here and there that get away with whatever, but… I mean, Rand Paul praises the hell out of Trump but also criticizes the extrajudicial killings. And I get it. You have to make compromises. But this is very, very distressing.\n\nI think they thought we were going to keep evolving as a country. They didn't think we were going to go the other way.\n\nYeah. That we had peaked in 1800.\n\nFinal question: You are Gen X, right?\n\nYes. Solidly so.\n\nOk. So do you see—and obviously Gen X and boomers spent most of the '80s and '90s fighting with each other because they're mortal enemies—now it's becoming clear boomers and Xers are kind of on one side of a generational divide, and Millennials and Gen Z are kind of on the other side.\n\nDo you see anything coming out of younger Americans—say, people under 45 or under 40—that will radically alter the politics of the country? Or the energy? Or the optimism level?\n\nMy impression of Millennials and Gen Z is that there's actually going to be quite a division between them.\n\nI think Millennials—and this is just anecdotal, do not hold me to this, and do not reply in the comments. My impression of Millennials is that they are fairly. Obviously there are exceptions, but they're fairly progressive.\n\nAnd I think Gen Z is going to be a lot more conservative. I think that—just my experience knowing Gen Z kids—my kids and their friends and whatever—I sense much more skepticism.\n\nAnd I think it's a reaction to Gen Xers and Millennials forcing on them progressive views on them in school. And I think there are going to be some conservatives. This just my general impression.\n\nThat was an early read of Gen Z and kind of a beta—but it may be what ends up happening, right?\n\nTrump did not win young voters, as he constantly says he did. But he did do better with them than other previous Republicans.\n\nAnd I just think that it's not just that he is reshaping and remaking politics and normalizing things that weren't normal 10 years ago.\n\nI also think it is a reaction to the failures of progressive movements to achieve what they wanted to achieve. Whether it's Bernie Sanders, whether it's Black Lives Matter, whether it's Me Too.\n\nI think it's COVID. I think it's a lot of progressive politics being forced down their throats in school.\n\nI think there's a lot of stuff going on.\n\n All right, we're going to leave it there. The person is Jake Tapper. And the new book is Race Against Terror.\n\nJake, thanks so much for talking.\n\nAlways great being here. Thanks so much, Nick.\n\nProducer: Paul AlexanderAudio Mixer: Ian Keyser","summary":"Jake Tapper examines the growing pressure on the news media to serve political interests, Donald Trump’s attacks on the press and peaceful protesters, as well as the lasting damage Joe Biden may have done to the Democratic Party.","url":"https://reason.com/podcast/2025/10/29/jake-tapper-on-censorship-media-failings-and-presidential-power/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/10/10-27-25-V9-A-2.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 15:00:23","author":"Nick Gillespie","authors":["Nick Gillespie"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":373769356,"title":"Joe Concha says Ciattarelli has a ‘very excellent shot’ to win election","text":"“[Sherrill] cannot explain how she made $7 million in the stock market while sitting on the Armed Services Committee in Congress — and she was trading defense stocks — nobody likes that: left or right,” Concha said.\n\n“Jack Ciattarelli, again, he wasn’t even supposed to be competitive against Phil Murphy four years ago, and he nearly won that race.

But Seoul has said it will invest $US350 billion in the US over many years and that the US will cut some tariffs to 15 per cent. \n\nCopied URL to clipboard\n\nTrump becomes first US president to receive South Korea’s highest honor\n\nPresident Trump was given a massive gold crown Wednesday by South...\n\nThe White House has confirmed that Mr Trump will meet Xi Jinping on Thursday in South Koreas. The high stakes one-on-one – which aims to lower economic tensions between Washington and Beijing – could last as long as four hours, Mr Trump said. \nThe US president continues to muse about the possibility of an unconstitutional third term in office. \nAfter saying he could run, he has now conceded that according to the US Constitution he’s “not allowed to run”. But it’s still not a full throttled dismissal that, somehow, it couldn’t happen which is what some of his biggest supporters have suggested. \nThe Pentagon has said around 1000 US troops will be removed from Romania, on Europe’s eastern flank. While it represents a small number of America’s overall troops in Europe it will concern NATO that it’s merely the first reduction as worries about Russia only increase. \nRead on for more updates. \n\n18 minutes ago\n\n HIGHLIGHT \n\n'Pretty clear': Donald Trump's third term admission\n\nBenedict Brook\n\nEver since Trump spruiker Steve Bannon said plans were afoot to find a way for Donald Trump to serve a third term – which is barred by the US Constitution – the US president has been peppered with questions about the prospect.\n\nIn just the last few days, he has said there might be a way to do so and he “would love to do it”.

She said she was in “shock” that Americans had chosen Trump again.\n\n“I was in a complete state of shock, and so much so that the only words I could speak, over and over again, were: ‘My God, my God, my God’,” she said, comparing her emotions to the grief she felt when her mother died.\n\n“It wasn’t about winning or losing. It was an altogether other thing that was about what will happen.”\n\nBut as Harris attempted to steer the interview into her regular anti-Trump talking points, Ferguson quickly moved to her time as Vice President and the responsibility she bared in the loss.\n\n Much of the interview focused on President Joe Biden’s decision to run for re-election, a move Harris now calls “reckless” not to have opposed.\n\nA bombshell report released this week revealed the former president’s actions were “not all his own” after the Democratic machine hid details of his health from the public.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee staff document — based on more than a dozen interviews with Biden aides — laid out how the Democrat’s “inner circle” took steps to “meticulously stage-manage” his public appearances, lighten his private workload, and even block politicians from talking to him.\n\nIt was all part of why Americans grew to distrust the Democrats leading into the 2024 election year. The party recklessly pressed ahead with the “everything is fine” narrative and assumed it would stick with 100 million voters.\n\n“I reflect on not talking him out of running and why I didn’t. And I ask myself was it grace or was it recklessness … and I think it was reckless,” Harris said.\n\n‘Not the question I asked you’\n\nThe most awkward moment came when Ferguson challenged Harris for pivoting away from tough questions over Biden. After Harris deflected criticism of him by pointing to Trump’s “misrepresentation of his intentions,” Ferguson cut in.\n\n“That is a world-class pivot but it is not the question I asked you,” she said.\n\nHarris bit back asking the ABC host to “be more specific”.\n\nBut then her curated answer sheet started to fall apart. When asked on Biden’s age and frailties, Harris repeatedly defended him.\n\n“I did not question Joe Biden’s capacity to be president at all … I never doubted that he had the capacity to be president of the United States,” she said.\n\nFerguson interrupted, pointing to Biden’s disastrous debate performance and a highlight reel of uncomfortable public slip-ups.\n\n Harris shrugged it off and blamed Biden’s travel schedule and exhaustion.\n\nHarris also described the immense challenge of facing Trump on short notice. Because the Democratic Party insisted Biden was fit to run until the very last minute, Kamala was forced into a rushed campaign.\n\nThe broader critique of her campaign was its narrow focus. Democrats placed heavy emphasis on women’s health and reproductive rights and assumed frustration with Trump would be enough to carry them over the line.\n\nThat calculation backfired horribly. \n\nInflation, immigration, and distrust of Washington were top concerns for many Americans, .\n\n Ferguson put it to Harris that she and the Democrats had to face the fact that they had “misjudged the scene.”\n\nHarris admitted things could have been done differently, but largely blamed the loss on short notice.\n\n“There was an impact … had we more time, perhaps the outcome would have been different. That is a fact,” she said.\n\nKamala’s reluctant praise for Trump\n\nHarris began the interview repeating the party line, that Trump was a disaster for America. But she couldn’t dig herself out of a question about the current president’s work in the recent Gaza ceasefire and hostage exchange.\n\n“First of all, I give credit where credit is due. I applaud that the hostages are out. I applaud that there is a ceasefire. I … It may be temporary. We will see. Each day, we’re seeing different levels of activity come out of that region. I give credit to the Egyptians, the Qataris and President Trump for arriving at the agreement,” she said.\n\nShe quickly added that “more work needs to be done” and stressed the uncertainty of “enduring peace”.\n\n It marked one of the few instances in the interview where Harris openly credited Trump’s actions.\n\nFerguson then pressed her on whether Trump should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize he has long coveted. Harris declined to entertain that idea, instead saying that the long-term questions of governance, security, and rebuilding in Gaza remained unresolved.","summary":"Kamala Harris has stumbled through an uncomfortable ABC interview where she was pulled up on a series of conflicting statements.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/kamala-harris-pulled-up-on-glaring-contradiction-over-joe-biden-in-awkward-abc-730-interview/news-story/21ff363aa8e927fb7adb893cffe0ed7a?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/c3bacc20a7583bb622bc3f2fc55719c4","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 14:58:38","author":"Alex Blair","authors":["Alex Blair"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.509},{"id":373867908,"title":"CNN's Cornish: Why Did Kamala Media Strategy Fail Despite  'Wave of Intense Support?'","text":"CNN This Morning\n\n6:28 am EDT\n\nAUDIE CORNISH: That mayoral candidate, Zohran Mamdani, is of course a viral sensation.

But Mamdani tells Wired he's expecting a different outcome. \n\nNow Wired calls him the internet's mayor, crediting his, quote, really, really good social strategy in making him a media machine. Joining me now to discuss, Katie Drummond, global editorial director at Wired. Katie, thanks for being with us this morning and bringing us that tape. You spoke with Mamdani. Can you talk, he is a community organizer. He has come up in organizing, so he understands retail politics. How has he turned the internet and social media into its own kind of retail politics? \n\nKATIE DRUMMOND: Well, first of all, thank you for having me. And you know, that's exactly right. I think what Mamdani has done from the beginning is\nhe has used these social platforms where he is able to amass enormous scale to connect directly with an electorate, right? To connect directly with different populations, to do it in a way that feels authentic to them, and to galvanize them from digital platforms into physical spaces. \n\nSo we see that, you know, with several initiatives that his campaign has undertaken. For example, they announced, you know, a scavenger hunt through New York on TikTok. They had 5,000 people turn up in the streets of New York to participate. \n\nSo he has really effectively been able to take his online reach and influence and translate that into physical, sort of feet on the ground New Yorkers, showing up for his campaign. \n\nCORNISH: How does work for campaigns, though? When I look at Kamala Harris, and we think about brat/coconut summer, there was this sense of like a wave \nintense support, right? And attention. Why do you think that that didn't quite translate the same way? \n\nDRUMMOND: Well, you know, it's hard to tell. We were talking in that federal election about a vastly different context. But I think that one differentiator for Mamdani, and what he has online, is that, you know, he's not just talking about coconuts, right? These are not just like memes and jokes. He is using the platform, sometimes in a lighthearted way, but always to articulate his campaign priorities and to do that with very simple, clear language. And I think that that sort of differentiator gives substance to his approach to social media.","summary":"Remember that \"wave of intense support\" for Kamala Harris in the summer of 2024, stemming from her social media campaign using terms like \"brat\" and \"coconut?\" Me neither.\n\nBut Audie Cornish does!

To get it delivered straight to your inbox (and to check out The Independent’s full range of other newsletters) click here.\n\nLast week, I had a private chat with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nI was taking my daughter, who’s 13 – and her friend – to see Vice President Harris “in conversation” with the fantastic feminist writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie at the Southbank Centre. When we arrived, security was sky-high, as you might expect – not least because there was a group of pro-Palestine protesters outside, calling for justice for Gaza and angry that the Biden administration hadn’t done enough to stop the bloodshed.\n\nI have enormous sympathy for anyone who stands up against (and calls out) the deaths of more than 68,000 Palestinians – and I was interested to see whether the disruption would be addressed by Harris when the event began. But what I wasn’t prepared for was that there would be three additional protesters planted in the audience, listening to her speak – and that two of them would be sitting in the seats right next to us. When Harris started talking, they stood up and shouted out, waving homemade placards on white cloth. Security acted immediately, telling us to move out of the way as, first one, then the other, were removed from the auditorium.\n\nI’m glad that the teenagers I was responsible for saw politics in action – it enables them to place their heroes in context, to realise that in the murky world of power, no one is blameless. But it was also disruptive and a little frightening – not least when several burly security guards forced their way past our seats to drag the interrupters out, accidentally sitting in our laps as they did so.\n\nMoments later, noticing the girls were a little shaken and upset, Harris’s team approached us to apologise – and to offer us a backstage meet-and-greet.\n\nI know. Without even realising what was happening, we were ushered down the steps while the talk continued, into the green room to wait for Kamala Harris – a world leader, a figure of history, an icon – to come and meet us. And then she did.\n\nWhat I saw made me wistful and nostalgic for a future that we didn’t get to experience. How different life would be now if Harris were in the White House. What a greatly improved, diverse and tolerant society America would be. What a role model she would be for our children and for women – rather than the sexist, egotistical, divisive disgrace that is Donald Trump. I only hope Harris will do as she’s hinted and stand again in 2028. \n\nIn person, she was warm, considerate and softly spoken. She also spent a good five minutes talking to me and the girls, without giving any sense that she needed to rush off. When my daughter opened with a shocked, “We love you!”, she smiled, held their hands, and told them she was so thankful that they’d come to listen – and she seemed to mean it. When my daughter’s friend informed her that they’d done a school project about her, but had been told off for “being too political”, she laughed wryly.\n\n“Well, you know what I have to say about that,” she said. “Use your voice, always. Never let anybody silence you – your thoughts or your opinions, right? I think sometimes when people do it, certain people do it to women, right? But you heard what I said out there. And you’ll have moments like that, but just know that we’re always cheering you on. It’s good to have feelings. This is your future. Give it 30 years – this is where being ‘too political’ gets you. Right here.” \n\nShe was so gracious and so inspiring, I just know it is a moment the girls will remember forever. And if Harris does run for office again – and wins – then they’ll know that they heard that inspirational message straight from the mouth of the President of the United States of America (here’s hoping). \n\nWhat do you think of Harris’s chances? I'm sure you, like me, are just waiting for the day a woman runs the White House – and finally stands up for women. It can’t come a moment too soon. \n\nLke what you read?

According to political pundits and lawmakers who spoke to Fox News Digital, their presence on the campaign trail likely would not generate warm welcomes following the fallout of the 2024 race. \"The one thing you could probably get progressives and moderates inside the Democratic Party to agree on is that the Biden/Harris administration did not score very high marks,\" former chief counsel to House Judiciary Committee Democrats Julian Epstein told Fox Digital Monday. \"I'm not sure why any candidate would want to go to either of them who voters rejected in one way or another and to who are widely seen that leading the party into the wilderness.\" The nation is facing only a handful of big-ticket races in 2025, with four most notably garnering national attention: the Virginia gubernatorial race, the New Jersey gubernatorial race, the New York City mayoral race, and California's special election to vote on a ballot measure that would redistrict the state's congressional lines. THE ONLY GOP GUBERNATORIAL CANDIDATES RUNNING IN 2025 ELECTIONS LEAN INTO TRUMP'S MAGA CAMPAIGN TACTICS The trio of elections in New Jersey, New York City and Virginia have especially attracted a handful of high-profile Democrats offering official endorsements of the candidates or traveling to those jurisdictions to help rally support among locals. Former President Barack Obama, for example, offered official video endorsements of New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial candidate Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Virginia Democratic candidate Abigail Spanberger earlier in October, and is scheduled to attend two separate rallies for the individual candidates Saturday. Former Secretary of Transportation under the Biden administration, Pete Buttigieg, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and others also have joined the gubernatorial candidates at various campaign fundraisers and events. Biden and Harris have meanwhile been largely absent from the 2025 campaign fray. \"Of course Democrats are running away from the disasters they created with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris,\" Republican Rep. Andy Barr, who is running for U.S. Senate in Kentucky, told Fox News Digital. \"It will take years to undo the damage they inflicted on our economy, our border, and our national security. Every Democrat on the ballot owns that record. Kentuckians will reject it and stand with us to fully advance President Trump’s America First agenda.\" Biden has not joined campaign events, with Fox News Digital also unable to find any public endorsements of 2025 political candidates as of Tuesday. Biden, notably, revealed in May that he was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had metastasized to his bones. Biden has taken a step back from the public spotlight since his administration ended, but he did attend an event Sunday, when he received a lifetime achievement award for inspired leadership from the Edward M. Kennedy Institute. TRUMP'S SHADOW LOOMS LARGE OVER HEATED RACES ONE MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY \"Friends, I can't sugarcoat any of this. These are dark days,\" Biden said during the event, adding that \"our very democracy is at stake in my view.\" Biden received the most votes in U.S. history during the 2020 race, at 81,283,501 votes, beating Obama's 2008 record of about 69,498,516 votes, and Trump's 2024 election that delivered him 77,302,580 votes. Harris, meanwhile, is in the midst of an ongoing book tour to promote her new memoir, \"107 Days,\" which recounts her experiences on the 2024 campaign trail, including when Biden decided to drop out of the race July 21, 2024, and the party's mad dash to rally around Harris as his replacement with just more than 100 days until Election Day. In New York City, Socialist mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani is building endorsements and support from Democrats and left-wing members of the party, including New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Harris did offer support for Mamdani's nomination to lead New York City while on her book tour, but has not offered endorsement campaign videos, joined rallies or taken part in other official campaign events like her party colleagues, Fox Digital found. \"Look, as far as I’m concerned, he’s the Democratic nominee, and he should be supported,\" Harris told MSNBC of Mamdani's candidacy in a September interview, before offering stronger support days later while recounting a phone conversation she shared with the candidate. OBAMA, PELOSI, OTHER TOP DEMS RESISTED INSTANT HARRIS ENDORSEMENT CITING NEED TO 'EARN IT,' 'HIKING' EXCUSE When asked about Harris not having officially endorsed candidates in the three major 2025 elections, a spokesperson contended, \"This isn't true at all. I would do more research and come back to me when you've got the facts sorted out.\" When it was noted that Harris has made some favorable comments about Mamdani but has yet to offer him a more formal endorsement or appear with him, Spanberger or Sherrill, Harris' team was similarly dismissive, pointing to fundraising emails and \"events for senate candidates,\" although there are no candidates for U.S. Senate in the 2025 race. Harris did take part in a roughly two-minute prerecorded video message to youth voters in July, as reported by the New York Post, rallying young voters to get involved in politics and stay committed to the \"fight,\" but did not cite specific campaigns. \"Keep building your political power, keep building community, keep building coalitions, keep challenging the status quo,\" Harris told the summit in the prerecorded video. \"And born out of our love for our country, keep fighting to build a country and a nation,\" she said. \"That works for everyone. And I look forward to continuing in the fight alongside you. You take care.\" Gen Z conservative podcast host and political commentator Brilyn Hollyhand told Fox News Digital, when asked about Biden's and Harris' absences from 2025 races, that \"the Democrat party is a sinking ship of a party and they’ll be the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean come the midterms.\" \"They have no leader and no bench and their loudest voices are Jasmine Crocket and Zohran Mamdani,\" he said. \"They spent millions studying why Gen Z men fled their party? I’ll give them the answer for free: look in the mirror. They went so far to the Left they fell off a cliff. Anybody running wants to stay as far away from claiming to be a Democrat as possible — it’s kryptonite,\" he said. The Democrat Party has been trying to find its footing since Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race amid mounting concerns over his mental acuity that had simmered for years before reaching a roiling boil following his disastrous debate against then-former President Donald Trump in June 2024. Party members began suggesting, before outright encouraging, Biden drop out of the race and pass the torch to a younger generation. He ultimately dropped out and endorsed Harris. The departure from the race threw the Democratic Party into a tailspin as it worked to build a presidential campaign with a new top-ticket candidate with just a few weeks before the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Former Trump official and Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate in Alabama, Morgan Murphy, told Fox News Digital that Biden and Harris \"were never more than 2D media props, employed to disguise how radical Democrats have become.\" \"This Halloween, soft socialists in places like New Jersey and Virginia are dressing up as moderates. Even they know that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are too toxic for voters in states they both won in 2020 and 2024,\" he said. \"At this point, Democrats are suffering from a bad hangover. Four failed years of high inflation, open borders, and foreign policy disasters is something democrats are trying to forget.\" Murphy argued that the Democrat Party has gone \"full Marxist\" and the \"only endorsements that matter to their increasingly leftist base are from socialists like Bernie Sanders, AOC, and Zohran Mandani.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Biden's office inquiring about the lack of official endorsements for candidates in 2025, considering he was president less than a year ago and garnered the most votes in U.S. history, but did not receive a reply. DEMOCRATS FRET RETURN OF JOE BIDEN, KAMALA HARRIS TO SPOTLIGHT AS PARTY TRIES TO 'TURN THE PAGE': REPORT The trio of high-stakes gubernatorial and mayoral elections has set the various jurisdictions on edge in the final week of the election cycle. New Jersey has been eyed as a potential deep blue state to flip red following Trump's inroads with voters during the 2024 cycle, with Republican candidate Jack Ciattarelli criss-crossing the Garden State's liberal strongholds to conservative farmlands to rally a Republican outpouring at the ballot boxes. The Virginia gubernatorial election pits a former Democratic lawmaker and CIA employee, Spanberger, against Marine veteran and current lieutenant governor Winsome Earle-Sears in a state considered purple and currently led by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin. The New York City mayoral race has gained widespread popularity as it pits a self-described socialist currently in the lead, according to polls, against the state's former Democratic governor and a longtime Republican candidate and fixture of the city. Mamdani, a self-described Democratic socialist, is accused by conservatives and moderates of actually holding communist ideologies, and is facing off against former Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo — who remained in the race as an Independent after Mamdani defeated him in the Democratic primary — as well as Republican challenger and founder of the Guardian Angels, Curtis Sliwa. The trio of Democratic campaigns in New Jersey, Virginia and New York City did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on Biden's and Harris' lack of involvement this cycle.

The lack of clarity didn’t exactly impress the long-term host of the show.\n\n“That’s not comforting,” he joked. “That’s like your Airbnb host saying, ‘You’ll sleep great in these bedrooms. We had the snake guy come three times last week, and he never found a snake. So there must not be one. Good night, sleep tight, don’t let the bed snake bite.'”\n\nStephen Colbert Hits Trump With Scathing ‘Quick Reminder’ About His Health https://t.co/14sM43fYQd\n— #TuckFrump (@realTuckFrumper) October 29, 2025\n\nAccording to Huffpost, Stephen Colbert reminded viewers, the test is not an IQ or aptitude test, but rather a basic screening tool for early signs of cognitive decline or dementia. While nothing has been confirmed about this stance by the administration, this is Trump’s second test; the first one was taken in April, where he was also declared “healthy.”\n\nFor context, a basic cognitive test is a tool used by medical professionals, researchers, and employers to measure mental functions like memory, language, reasoning, and problem-solving. On the other hand, real intelligence tests are often from an individualistic perspective and are not defined by a singular definition.\n\nColbert also said, “As a reminder, the cognitive test Trump took isn’t meant to measure intelligence, and not knowing the difference between those two things is exactly why they make you take one.”\n\nDespite repeated claims of dementia, narcissistic tendencies followed by physical issues, Trump was adamant that what he underwent was an intelligence test and even mocked Texas Rep Jasmine Crockett, calling her a “low IQ” while challenging others to take it themselves.\n\nPresident Trump WRECKS lame late night hosts🤣\n“Colbert has no talent. I mean, I could take anybody here, I could go outside on the beautiful streets and pick up a couple of people that’d do just as well or better. They’d get higher ratings… Fallen has no talent. Kimmel has no… pic.twitter.com/KpuGereXy1\n— Trump War Room (@TrumpWarRoom) August 6, 2025\n\nCrockett hit back with a fiery response and said she could “guarantee” Trump’s IQ qualifies as low, if he’s even taken such a test recently, and added that she’s waiting for a reporter to ask him his actual IQ score, given how often he boasts about it.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has already had longstanding issues with all three hosts of the iconic “Late Show.” Previously, POTUS took to his Truth Social and said, “Everybody is saying that I was solely responsible for the firing of Stephen Colbert from CBS’s Late Night.” This rant came a few weeks after Stephen Colbert’s contract was canceled. \n\n“That is not true!” Trump asserted while adding, “The reason he was fired was a pure lack of TALENT, and the fact that this deficiency was costing CBS $50 million a year in losses, and it was only going to get WORSE!”\n\nWhen Trump was questioned about the same at a press briefing, he said, “Colbert has no talent, and I could take anybody here; I could go outside in the beautiful streets and pick up a couple of people that do just as well or better. They get higher ratings than he did. He has got no talent.”\n\nIn addition, Trump has had a lawsuit with Paramount Global, CBS’s parent company, since July 2025. Paramount has reportedly agreed to pay $16 million to settle a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Donald Trump, who accused CBS News’ 60 Minutes of deceptively editing an interview with former vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nAs of August 2025, the IMDb rating of The Late Night Show with Stephen Colbert is 7.1, and Jimmy Fallon’s The Tonight Show boasts a 7/10 rating, while Jimmy Kimmel Live has a 6.4 rating on IMDb.","summary":"Stephen Colbert's hilarious take on Trump's recent health results sparks controversy amidst a long-standing feud with him and CBS.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/stephen-colbert-points-out-one-cue-about-donald-trumps-health-with-scathing-reminder","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Donald-Trump-and-Stephen-Colbert-.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 13:24:19","author":"Sweta Choudhury","authors":["Sweta Choudhury"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.176},{"id":373758166,"title":"Paramount Skydance to cut more than 1,000 employees","text":"Paramount began a sweeping round of layoffs Wednesday, according to a memo from CEO David Ellison, just months after the Trump administration greenlit its controversial $8 billion merger with Skydance, an entertainment group looking to shake up the entire media ecosystem. The layoffs will initially impact more than 1,000 employees, according to a source familiar with the company who spoke on the condition of anonymity. In the memo, Ellison wrote that the company is \"phasing out roles that are no longer aligned with our evolving priorities and the new structure designed to strengthen our focus on growth.\" More layoffs are reportedly expected to happen at a later date. In August 2025, Variety reported that layoffs are estimated to total up to 3,000 workers (NBC News has not confirmed that reporting). All cuts were expected to be announced ahead of Paramount’s third-quarter earnings call Nov. 10. Paramount, now officially known as Paramount Skydance, owns CBS and its news division’s longtime trophy property, “60 Minutes,” as well as BET, MTV and Nickelodeon, plus Paramount’s film properties such as the “The Smurfs” and “Sonic the Hedgehog” franchises. Investors have thus far been pleased with Paramount’s performance since its shares were reorganized in August, sending its stock price up more than 50%. The company is worth about $18 billion. The Paramount layoffs announcement comes amid Ellison’s aggressive pursuit of Warner Bros. Discovery. In September, NBC News confirmed reports that Paramount was preparing a bid for the parent company of CNN, a move that confirmed speculation that Ellison may be interested in creating a news and entertainment juggernaut that would reshape the U.S. media and political landscape. Warner Bros. ultimately rejected that bid, but announced earlier this month that it was officially putting itself up for sale. Trump administration regulators would also have to approve any deal for Warner Bros. But Ellison, the son of Oracle co-founder and close Donald Trump ally Larry Ellison, has already proven adept at currying favor with the president by extinguishing what critics have called Paramount’s liberal bent. He appointed Bari Weiss, an outspoken critic of progressivism, as the new editor-in-chief of CBS News. Shortly after Skydance officially took over Paramount, the company announced it would be ending the tenure of Stephen Colbert, long seen as a liberal commentator, as host of “The Late Show.” In the run-up to the Paramount approval, Skydance signaled the newly formed company would commit to focusing on “American storytelling” while touting a new, “unbiased” editorial direction for CBS News. In July, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit brought by Trump that had accused CBS News’ “60 Minutes” of airing an edited clip of an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that Trump said unduly affected the 2024 election. As of 2024, Paramount Global had approximately 18,600 employees worldwide, according to company filings.","summary":"Paramount began a sweeping round of layoffs Wednesday, according to a memo from CEO David Ellison, just months after the Trump administration greenlit its controversial $8 billion merger with Skydance, an entertainment group looking to shake up the entire media ecosystem.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/paramount-skydance-layoffs-rcna240067","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-10/251028-paramount-pictures-lr-cf7dad.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 12:15:12","author":"Chloe Melas,Rebecca Keegan,Rob Wile","authors":["Chloe Melas","Rebecca Keegan","Rob Wile"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":373703742,"title":"Care home nurse who slapped elderly resident when they bit her finger is struck off","text":"Home and Garden\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nThe Crime Desk\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeft behind by her cruise ship on a deserted island: Questions grow over 'forgotten' woman, 80, who died on first stop of $80,000 dream cruise\n\nSex assault migrant released from prison by mistake was PAID £500 in taxpayers' cash to leave Britain\n\nRoyal biographer claims there is 'a good chance' Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson 'could go to prison'\n\nSARAH VINE: The Andrew snowball thunders on, flattening all in its path...

Email lettice.bromovsky@dailymail.co.uk \nBy LETTICE BROMOVSKY, NEWS REPORTER \n Published:12:07 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:12:12 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nA senior care home nurse has been struck off after she slapped a vulnerable resident who bit her finger, before lying to cover up what she had done.\nJulie McKinney lashed out at the resident while attempting to administer medication, a tribunal heard. \nBut she later falsified records to conceal the assault, according to findings by the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC).\nThe hearing was also told that foul-mouthed Ms McKinney swore at residents, calling one a 'fat b*****d' and another a 'lazy f*****g bitch'.\nThe NMC has now permanently erased Ms McKinney's name from the nursing register after finding her guilty of misconduct.\nMcKinney began working at the unnamed Edinburgh care home in 2020 and was promoted to senior staff nurse in 2023. \nHowever, she came under investigation by the Care Inspectorate in April 2024 following an anonymous complaint about alleged abuse of residents.\nAt a disciplinary hearing, McKinney denied slapping the resident or using offensive language towards those in her care - though she did admit falsifying the incident report and using inappropriate language during staff handovers.\nShe claimed her comments about slapping the resident were meant as a joke, insisting she 'would never ever do this.'\nBut the tribunal rejected her explanation.\n\nA senior care home nurse has been struck off after she slapped a vulnerable resident who bit her finger, before lying to cover up what she had done (stock image)\nA care assistant gave evidence stating: 'I half stopped and I heard Ms McKinney say words to the effect of 'A resident bit my f***ing finger, I had to slap her to let go.'\nIn her written report of the incident, McKinney falsely claimed that two other staff members had opened the resident's mouth to free her fingers, rather than her slapping the resident herself. \nThe tribunal concluded that this was a deliberate lie.\nTribunal chair George Duff said: 'The panel determined that it was not credible that Miss McKinney would be able to recall not slapping the resident, yet not recall how she removed her fingers from their mouth.\n'The panel further considered the question of Miss McKinney's credibility. It noted that she has admitted to dishonestly completing an incident form.\n'The panel was concerned about why Miss McKinney would falsify the incident form, stating that two other members of staff were present when they were not.\n'The panel determined Miss McKinney would have no reason to falsify the records unless she was covering something up.\n'The panel was not satisfied of the veracity of Miss McKinney's denial of slapping the resident. It found her account of the incident to be inconsistent and not credible, and noted she has admitted to dishonesty.\n'On the balance of probabilities, the panel determined it was more likely than not that Miss McKinney did slap the resident across the face.'\nThe tribunal also found McKinney guilty of repeatedly using obscene language toward both residents and staff.\nAs a result, the NMC ruled that her behaviour was 'wholly incompatible' with professional nursing standards, striking her off the register with immediate effect.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nCare home nurse who slapped elderly resident when they bit her finger is struck off\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy CHARLOTTE DEAN, ASSOCIATE SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:11:55 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:12:19 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nBirds Of A Feather has gone down as one of the most popular shows in sitcom history after running for 12 series over a span of 30 years - with the cast having just as interesting lives off-camera as they did on-screen.\nThe stars of the show became instantly recognisable to fans and the show's theme tune is just as memorable as the characters, which included leading ladies Linda Robson and Pauline Quirke - sisters who come together over their jailed husbands.\nThe Cockney sisters - Tracey Stubbs and Sharon Theodopolopodous - are left to fend for themselves when their other halves are sentenced for armed robbery and despite not getting on initially, they band together to get through it.\nDown and out Sharon [Pauline] moves from her Edmonton council flat to live with her sister Tracey [Linda] in her upmarket Chigwell home, which becomes the backdrop to the classic nineties sitcom.\nThe two women befriend their flirty neighbour Dorien Green [Lesley Joseph], who viewers discover is unhappily married and continually having affairs with younger men with disastrous results.\nThe much loved programme originally ran from 1989 until 1998, before it was revived in 2014 for a further three series. The last episode of the show was a Christmas special aired in 2020 - but without one of the key characters.\n\nBirds Of A Feather has gone down as one of the most popular shows in sitcom history after running for 12 series over a span of 30 years (David Cardy, Pauline Quirke, Lesley Joseph, Linda Robson and Alun Lewis) \nPauline's character Tracey did not appear in the final episode when the show came to an emotional end, with Linda later citing that she was focusing on her drama school when the long-term friends were hit by feud speculation.\nThe actress' husband has since confirmed that Pauline has been diagnosed with dementia and has retired from acting to spend time with her family.\nMost recently, Lesley gave a devastating health update on her best friend's dementia battle.\nPauline, 65, was diagnosed with the disease in 2021, but the illness only became public knowledge when her husband Steve Sheen made an announcement in January this year.\nThis week, Lesley, 80, admitted the actress is 'not okay' as she gave an update while chatting to Bella magazine at the Variety Club Showbusiness Awards last week. \nShe admitted: 'Pauline is not too well after being diagnosed with dementia a while ago. She's not okay now. I haven't had time, but I'm going to go up and see her next week.'\nFollowing the sad news of Pauline's deteriorating health, MailOnline takes a look at the colourful lives of the cast and their tragic and triumphant legacies.\n\nWhile Alun is known best for playing Tracey's ill-fated husband Darryl, there are some facts about him that may come as a surprise to viewers.\nThe actor has a very famous daughter and has also called not one, but two A-lister actors, his 'son-in-law' after they tied the knot with her. \nAlun appeared as a recurring character during the nineties run of series, before later being replaced by Douglas McFerran.\nDarryl's repeated brushes with the law put strain on his marriage to Tracey, with the series beginning with him being sent to prison for armed robbery.\nThe character, which had been taken over by Douglas at the time, met a sticky end when he was killed off during a robbery which went wrong.\nAlun is equally well known for his part in Emmerdale as Vic Windsor, but he took a step back from the spotlight after the two major roles.\nOutside of acting, Alun was a member of rock trio, The Woolpackers, with his soap co-stars Steve Halliwell and Billy Hartman. \n\nAlun is equally well known for his part in Emmerdale as Vic Windsor (pictured), where he starred from 1993 to 1998 but he took a step back from the spotlight after the two major roles\n\nWhile Alun is known best for playing Tracey's ill-fated husband Darryl, there are some facts about him that may come as a surprise to viewers \n\nThe actor has a very famous daughter and has called not one but two A-lister actors he has called his 'son-in-law' after they tied the knot with her\n\nAmelia Warner has followed in her father's musical footsteps and pursued a career as a musician, under the stage name Slow Moving Millie\nWhat may come as a shock is Alun's daughter Amelia Warner's relationship history and the two actors he has welcomed into his family.\nAmelia has followed in her father's musical footsteps and pursued a career as a musician, under the stage name Slow Moving Millie.\nShe started an acting career as a member of the Royal Court's youth theatre group, and in 2000 she featured in a BBC adaptation of Lorna Doone. \nHowever, she moved into music and hit the UK charts in 2011 with a cover of The Smiths' Please, Please, Please, Let Me Get What I Want - reaching number 31. \nBy 2015, Amelia was self-releasing original music with her first EP called Arms. \nAs for her love life, Amelia was married to Colin Farrell for a brief period of time.\nHer two worlds collided in the next years when she started producing music for films.\nIn 2018, Amelia won Breakthrough Composer of the Year at the International Film Music Critics Association Awards for for her debut mainstream score, on the film Mary Shelley.\n\nShe also had a whirlwind 'marriage' to Colin Farrell back in 2001. Just four months after they met, they married on the island of Tahiti, although it was never legalised (pictured together)\n\nAlthough their wedding was a joke, the couple were also engaged to be married for real and Amelia was devastated when they split\nAmelia had a whirlwind 'marriage' to Colin back in 2001. Just four months after they met, they married on the island of Tahiti, although it was never legalised.\nAs a symbol of his love, Colin had Amelia's name tattooed onto his ring finger, but they split just four months later.\nShe said afterwards of the wedding: 'It was just a thing we did on holiday.\n'We went shark feeding and then we did that. We booked them both on the activities desk at the hotel - it really wasn't this secret wedding that no one was invited to.\n'It was lovely, it was silly, it was sweet but by no means was it a serious thing and I think my mum thought it was quite funny.' \nAlthough their wedding was a joke, the couple were also engaged to be married for real and Amelia was devastated when they split.\nShe told The Sun: 'Maybe if we had lasted longer as a couple, we would have legalised it.\n'I still look back at that time with him with such fondness, I adored Colin, and I always will — but we're just good friends now.'\nFollowing their 'divorce' she met Fifty Shades actor Jamie Dornan, with whom she shares three children with after they first began dating in 2010.\nDuring an appearance on Face to Face, Jamie previously gushed over Amelia and said: 'I had this weird thing where I always felt that if I met her that we would just get on. It was just a strange thing. Something about her eyes. I just thought that we would work.'\nRevealing how they met on the The Late Late Show with James Corden, he explained: 'She'd been an actor so I knew who she was, and we were doing karaoke and a friend of ours said, 'Listen, Amelia Warner's at a house party up by Los Feliz and she's single.' I literally dropped the mic and was like, you know, ran for the hills.'\nIn January 2024, Jamie broke down during a Desert Island Discs appearance, as he revealed the thing he would need to get him through would be the thought of his wife.\nJamie appeared on Lauren Laverne's BBC Radio 4 show - where he said the song he would fight through the waves to retrieve would be Forever by The Beach Boys.\nIn an touching tribute, Jamie admitted the song would be top of the list as it reminds him of his wife, musician Amelia, who he shares three daughters with.\nAt the end of the interview, Lauren asked: 'Which one track of the eight you have shared with us today would you rush to save from the waves?'\n'Forever by the Beach Boys,' Jamie replied, before his voice cracked and he got choked up, adding: 'The one thing I would really need to get me through is the thought of my wife and everything that she has given me and our family.'\nThe couple married in 2013, before going on to welcome three daughters: Dulcie, who was born in the same year, Elva, who arrived in 2016, and Alberta, who the couple welcomed in 2019.\nPeter Polycarpou\nPeter played Pauline's husband Chris for five series, but he has a very interesting life away from the small screen - including a foray into politics.\nOn the show, Peter was caught up in one of Darryl's hairbrained schemes and is sent back to prison despite being innocent after trying to start afresh.\nFollowing his time on Birds Of A Feather, Peter appeared in several hit series including BBC show Hustle and thriller Cleanskin with Sean Bean. \nSince his time on the show, Peter has appeared in a number of hit series, including BBC's Hustle and thriller Cleanskin alongside Sean Bean.\n\nPeter played Pauline's husband Chris for five series before he was also replaced alongside Alun when they were released from prison (pictured second right)\n\nPeter played Pauline's husband Chris for five series before he was also replaced alongside Alun when they were released from prison (pictured second right)\n\nMost of Peter's acting career has taken place on the stage, including a 2019 appearance as Sancho in Man of La Mancha for English National Opera alongside Kelsey Grammar \n\nIn 2017, he also starred in a production of Oslo at the Royal Nayional Theatre\nWhen it comes to the big screen, English-Cypriot Peter starred in Evita alongside Madonna, as well as Oklahoma! an De-Lovely.\nMost of Peter's acting career has taken place on the stage, including a 2019 appearance as Sancho in Man of La Mancha for English National Opera alongside Kelsey Grammar and Nicholas Lyndhurst.\nPeter has also enjoyed a foray into politics when he became a green party politician and stood for local election in Muswell Hill.\nHe campaigned for the return of the elgin marbles to their native home in Greece. \nThey were removed from the Parthenon in Athens by Lord Elgin in the early 1800's and are currently on display at the British Museum.\nPeter said: 'Imagine that 200 years ago parts of Stonehenge were taken secretly to France and then turned up in the Louvre as part of an exhibition. \n'The British public would be would be outraged.

Obviously I couldn't see her during lockdown but I've seen her since. \n'She just doesn't want to act anymore. She's had enough - it's long hours. She's concentrating on her drama academies. She's very hands on, going to classes and all that.'\nPauline's drama academy was caught up in the shocking murder of three little girls in Southport because the murderer - Axel Rudakubana - attended Pauline's school, Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts.\nRudakubana pleaded guilty on Monday at Liverpool Crown Court to 16 offences, including three counts of murder after killing Bebe King, six, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, nine.\nBut before this, Rudakubana grew up as a budding child star actor - attending a branch of a drama school founded by Pauline before featuring in a BBC Children In Need video.\nThe teenager who this week admitted killing three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class was previously a pupil at the Southport branch of the Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts.\nThe PQA was set up by the Birds Of A Feather actress in 2007 and now has a network of about 250 academies as well as more than 15,000 students across Britain.\nRudakubana was pictured in 2017 receiving his drama branch's 'performer of the week' award, in an image shared on Facebook.\nAt the same time, Rudakubana was also part of a local youth drama group through which he performed on a West End show at central London's Shaftesbury Theatre.\nThe drama group also created 'their own movie' which was reportedly shown at a Vue cinema where the children were walked down a red carpet.\nAnd in 2018, as exclusively revealed by MailOnline, he was filmed emerging from the Tardis in Doctor Who actor David Tennant's trademark trenchcoat and tie - before urging the nation to help children by getting involved in fundraising.\nThat came in a BBC Children in Need clip after he was billed as a 'superstar' by a talent agency run by a former Premier League footballer's wife.\n\nAxel Rudakubana, who this week pleaded guilty to murdering three girls at a dance class last year, was pictured in 2017 with an award at his drama academy branch in Southport\n\nHe featured in 2018 in a Doctor Who-themed video for BBC's Children In Need\nIn another tragic update, it was revealed this week that Pauline has been living with dementia for four years after learning of her diagnosis aged 61.\nHer husband Steve Sheen announced in a statement on Monday that the the Birds Of A Feather star, 65, is set to 'step away from all commercial and professional duties'.\nAccording to Steve, the award-winning actress succumbed to the degenerative disease in 2021.\nIn a statement revealing Pauline's diagnosis for the first time, Steve said: 'It is with a heavy heart that I announce my wife Pauline's decision to step back from all professional and commercial duties due to her diagnosis of Dementia in 2021.\n'Pauline has been an inspiration through her work in the film and TV industry, her charity endeavours and as the founder of the very successful Pauline Quirke Academy of Performing Arts (PQA).\n'Her talent, dedication, and vision have touched countless lives and will continue to do so through the legacy of her work and through PQA where her vision and guidance has facilitated many young peoples' progression and interest in the Arts and enhanced their self-confidence.'\nIn February, Linda revealed Pauline 'no longer recognises me or her children'.\nShe admitted she has known about the Birds Of A Feather star's diagnosis for three years as she shared an update on her close friend.\nIn an upsetting admission, Linda also said she would 'rather get cancer' over dementia 'because at least then you’ve got a chance'.\nLinda told The Sun at the V Choice Awards: 'It’s very sad. We’ve been best friends since we were ten. I’ve known [about the diagnosis] for three years and we've managed to keep it quiet.\n'She doesn’t know who anybody is. She doesn’t know who I am or who her kids are. Dementia is terrible - I’d rather get cancer, because at least then you’ve got a chance.'\nLinda also revealed to MailOnline she had been privately supporting Pauline by phoning her.\nShe said she had spoken to Pauline on FaceTime but there was 'not much conversation'.\nExplaining that seeing her face is more than enough, she said: 'I've been FaceTiming. There's not much conversation but it's just nice to see her face really.'\nLinda also discussed the warm reaction she has had from people who speak to her about Pauline, saying: 'Yeah people do say, sorry to hear about your friend.'\nRevealing her plans to see her soon, she said: 'She's in the best place and she's got family looking after her.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk\nBy MILLY VEITCH, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:11:55 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:12:02 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nVictoria Beckham has explained how she has been able to stay calm during 'intense situations' as she admitted that she learned through being the mum to four kids.\nThe fashion designer, 51, recently opened up her life to fans with her eponymous Netflix docuseries earlier this month, documenting the highs and lows of her career and personal life.\nThe three-part series followed the former Spice Girl in the run up to her Paris Fashion Week show in September 2024 – the biggest catwalk occasion she had ever thrown.\nAnd after being praised her for the way she was able to compartmentalize in stressful situations and remain even within the chaos, Victoria opened up on how she was able to stay so outwardly calm.\nTaking to Krista Smith on the Skip Intro podcast, she explained how she worked to 'internalize' her feelings, so as not to effect those around her, but admitted that 'there's a lot going on on the inside'.\nShe said: 'I think I've always been quite a disciplined person. You know, that's just who I am. That's how I lead my life. But I do, I cope quite well in those intense situations. \n\nVictoria Beckham has explained how she has been able to stay calm during 'intense situations' as she admitted that she learned through being the mum to four kids\n\nAfter being praised her for the way she was able to compartmentalize in stressful situations and remain even within the chaos, Victoria opened up on how she was able to stay so outwardly calm\n\nTaking to Krista Smith on the Skip Intro podcast , she explained how she worked to 'internalize' her feelings, so as not to effect those around her, but admitted that 'there's a lot going on on the inside' \n'And this is how I choose to lead my team. I have to internalize those things, because if not, it has like a domino effect, and that is not productive. \n'And I surround myself with great people. We all work very, very closely and very well together. And I'm just mindful of that. Is one of my, might you call it leadership skills, if you like.\n'I'm glass half full. I'm very, very positive. I believe in positive energy. But there's a lot going on on the inside.'\nVictoria went on to explain being the mum of four children with husband David - Brooklyn, 26, Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 14 - had forced her to learn how to be disciplined, confessing she was 'a control freak'.\nShe said: 'Well, listen, let's be honest, I've got four children as well. Okay, so I think that as a mum you learn to, you know? \n'The truth is I am a control freak. Well, I say I went into the documentary process a control freak and I've come out the other end a reformed control freak, because I haven't had that control. \n'I mean, I've seen little bits of the documentary along the way, but I hadn't seen the final edit until the premiere.'\nHer comments come amid her and David's ongoing rift with eldest child, Brooklyn and his heiress wife Nicola Peltz, 30, with the family not talking in months.\n\nVictoria went on to explain being the mum of four children with husband David - Brooklyn, 26, Romeo, 23, Cruz, 20, and Harper, 14 (seen in 2023) - had forced her to learn how to be disciplined, confessing she was 'a control freak' \n\nHer comments come amid her and David's ongoing rift with eldest child, Brooklyn and his heiress wife Nicola Peltz, 30, (seen) with the family not talking in months\nThere have been suggestions that Nicola is at the centre of the dispute, with reports that she encouraged Brooklyn to distance himself from his parents. \nThe couple appear to have washed their hands of the entire Beckham clan after failing to attend any of his father David's 50th birthday celebrations in May and growing closer with Nicola's family. \nLast week, Victoria spoke about the 'changing dynamic' in her family in a thinly-veiled remark about the ongoing feud with her Brooklyn and Nicola.\nAppearing on the Call Her Daddy podcast with Alex Cooper she spoke about her 'close family', but did not reference Brooklyn directly.\nVictoria shared how she tries to create a 'safe forum' where her children are able to come and talk to her about any issues they may have and 'allows them make their own decisions'.\nShe said: 'I mean, we're such a close family and, you know, communication is key and we always let them know that anything that they want to talk about, you know, this is a safe forum. You know, that's really important.'\nPressed on how she and David deal with the changing dynamics in their family, she insisted: 'Again, it's just about communicating.\n'We've always been that way with the kids. And I'm excited for them, they're all very different. They all like to do different things.'\n\nLast week, Victoria spoke about the 'changing dynamic' in her family in a thinly-veiled remark about the ongoing feud with her Brooklyn and Nicola \n\nIn what appeared to be an olive branch to her son and his wife, Victoria included footage of Brooklyn and Nicola in her docuseries, despite their estrangement \nThe family haven't been pictured together since Boxing Day last year, with Brooklyn missing both David and Victoria's birthdays and failing to support his mother's documentary release.\nFurthermore none of the Beckham clan were present at Brooklyn and Nicola's vow renewals in August. \nThe young couple, who first wed in 2022, failed to invite any members of Brooklyn's family, with reports David and Victoria heartbreakingly found out about their big day after reading about it on a US website.\nIt's a stark contrast to Nicola's family, who had key roles at the second wedding, with her father Nelson, 83, officiating, wearing her mother Claudia's, 70, vintage wedding gown and letting her parents take centre stage once again at the after party. \nIn what appeared to be an olive branch to her son and his wife, Victoria included footage of Brooklyn and Nicola in her docuseries, despite their estrangement. \nIn scenes filmed at Victoria's September 2024 Paris Fashion Week show, the designer launched into an emotional monologue about her desire to make her family and colleagues proud.\nThe montage cut between images of Victoria's collaborators, with Brooklyn and Nicola seen mingling with guests in the background.\n\nVictoria BeckhamParis Fashion WeekNetflix\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nVictoria Beckham admits she internalises her feelings amid feud with son Brooklyn as she reveals how her four children turned her into a 'control freak'\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 28\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Here's how I finally cured my chronic pain with an ancient medicine and got my life back\n\nDo you have a story? Email carina.stathis@dailymail.com.au \nBy CARINA STATHIS, SENIOR FEATURES WRITER, AUSTRALIA \n Published:11:55 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:11:55 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nWhen Lee Holmes awoke one morning in 2008, a deep, unshakable ache gripped her body and a wave of exhaustion pinned her to the bed. She hadn’t exercised, partied or touched a drop of alcohol – yet she felt as though she'd been hit by a truck.\nFor the single mother from Sydney, even standing up felt impossible, but she pushed through, determined to get her daughter to school and herself to work.\n'I felt really achy all over my body all of the time. I eventually started noticing my hair was falling out and ending up on my pillow,' Lee, now a nutritionist, told the Daily Mail.\nThe pain and fatigue only worsened over time. Worried, Lee went to her doctor for tests – only to be told nothing was wrong. \nWhat followed was a cycle of doctor appointments, blood tests and scans, with no answers in sight and symptoms that baffled even experienced specialists.\n'I felt like I was in a pinball machine. I was constantly in and out of St Vincent's Hospital, bouncing from one specialist to another,' the 58–year–old said. \n'I felt gaslit by the medical system. While I do believe in Western medicine, this felt unfair. I just wanted answers but no one could tell me what was wrong. \n'I was like, \"Is it in my head?\"'\n\nIt took four years for nutritionist Lee Holmes, a single mother from Sydney, to be diagnosed with fibromyalgia\n\nWhen her symptoms worsened, Lee had to quit her job in 2010. It wasn't until two years later that she discovered a solution \nEventually, after four frustrating years of searching, Lee would be diagnosed with fibromyalgia, a chronic condition that causes widespread pain, exhaustion and mental fog.\nIt's often misunderstood, even by medical professionals, due to symptoms that can mimic other illnesses and look invisible from the outside. \nSufferers can experience body pain, fatigue, sleep problems and brain fog – with no clear cause and often no swift diagnosis. \nBut before her diagnosis, all Lee got were prescriptions for the various symptoms – nothing to address the underlying cause. Pregabalin for nerve pain, antidepressants for mood as well as pain relief, muscle relaxants and steroids.\n'While these medications masked the symptoms, they also came with challenging side effects like persistent fatigue, dizziness and digestive discomfort, which sometimes felt almost as debilitating as the fibromyalgia and inflammatory dysregulation itself,' she said.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Could this radical treatment for depression be the solution for high-achieving women? \nThe steroids were the worst: they made her face swell and eventually triggered drug-induced psychosis after several months.\nBy 2010, the relentless toll of chronic pain and the punishing side effects of her medication forced Lee to walk away from her beloved job at the Australian Broadcasting Corporation – a loss that left her heartbroken.\nWith no end in sight, her doctor appointments were becoming soul-crushing, too. A low point was when a specialist bluntly told her: 'You have the cells of an Aids patient and I don't know why.'\nWhen she finally got an answer – fibromyalgia – Lee admits she was a nervous wreck.\nShe felt guilty for how the illness had impacted her family life – especially how much she needed to sleep. At the time, her daughter was 13 and needed an attentive and present mother in her life.\nOnce Lee finally had a name for her debilitating symptoms, she began to look at her diet and daily habits for answers in search of relief, having felt let down in the past by conventional medicine.\nShe started by simplifying the food she ate – turning away from processed products and big, heavy meals and focusing on simple dishes like bone broths, slow-cooked stews and root vegetables that were gentle on her stomach.\n'I cooked really simple foods that were gentle on my tummy and started noticing a difference,' she recalled. \nShe paid close attention to ingredients, experimenting to learn what helped her feel better and what made her symptoms worse.\nLee also embraced lifestyle changes such as yoga, outdoor walks and meditation – all of which helped soothe her mind and body, easing both pain and fatigue.\n'I learnt about the ingredients I was using and discovering what I could cook with to detox my body,' she added.\nThrough new meal and movement routines, Lee was finally able to manage the pain, brain fog and tiredness that had ruled her life for so long.\nShe found that choosing warming foods, cooking with vegetables and healthy fats, and getting plenty of rest were especially helpful. \n\n Lee, pictured in India, found Ayurveda to be more effective than any of the drugs she was prescribed\n\nWhat is Ayurveda? \n\nAyurveda is a holistic Indian healing system that helps you to achieve balance through dietary changes, herbal remedies, yoga, meditation, massage and detoxification therapies. \nCentral to Ayurvedic philosophy are the three doshas – Vata, Pitta and Kapha – which represent different combinations of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air and space). Each person has a unique constitution, or prakriti, determined by the balance of these doshas.\nWhile widely practised in India, Ayurveda is increasingly used as a complementary approach to health and chronic conditions in the West \n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile searching for answers, Lee also came across Ayurveda – an ancient system of Indian medicine focused on diet, lifestyle and balance.\nInterested in its practical advice, she travelled to Kerala, India, for a course.\nThere she learned how nutrition and daily habits could support the body and reduce symptoms.\n'The course started with yoga and meditation, before explaining how Ayurveda focuses on prevention by addressing the root cause of the problem – something I believe was ignored by doctors back home,' she said.\nShe learned about different energy types – or 'doshas' – and found eating warming foods such as soups and stews, cooked vegetables, and healthy fats helped her manage pain and fatigue.\n'Balancing my own dosha through tailored dietary choices allowed me to fuel my body correctly and prevent inflammation from recurring,' Lee said.\nLee explained she had come to understand fibromyalgia through the lens of Ayurveda, which classifies it as a Vata imbalance – a disruption of the dosha associated with movement, the nervous system and the elements of air and space.\nThose with a Vata constitution are encouraged to stay warm, steer clear of frozen foods, prioritise rest, spend time walking outdoors, nurture creativity, and begin the day with gentle yoga movements like cat-cow stretches. \nBy adopting these practical principles, Lee gradually experienced relief and saw significant, lasting changes in her health.\n'I'm not bedbound anymore. I'm not debilitated. And now I'm aware when I'm getting overwhelmed and can stop and re-implement strategies like yoga, breathing or meditation.\n'I think it's a really good tool to have for life.'\nWhile her symptoms do flare up from time to time, Lee now has proven methods to keep things under control.\nHer journey is a reminder when Western medicine falls short, small shifts in diet and routine can make a real difference for people living with fibromyalgia.\n\nFIBROMYALGIA AND AYURVEDA \n\nIn 2009, researchers in Norway explored the effects of Maharishi Ayurveda on women diagnosed with fibromyalgia.\nThirty-one women with diagnosed fibromyalgia underwent a personalised Ayurvedic program at the Maharishi Ayurveda Health Centre in Norway.\nThe treatment included Maharishi Vedic physiological purification therapy, along with tailored dietary guidance based on Ayurvedic principles, including food intolerance management and daily routines.\nAfter six months, the research found that 28 subjects (90 per cent) completed the follow-up and their symptoms were reduced by 24 to 46 per cent.\nIn this pilot study, the fibromyalgia patients showed significant improvements six months post treatment.\nSince fibromyalgia is considered a treatment–resistant condition, these encouraging results warrant further research.\nSource: National Library of Medicine \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nFibromyalgia was slowly killing me and doctors were useless.

The tense interview with host Jake Tapper quickly escalated, forcing him to cut to a commercial mid-discussion.\n\nMiller, married to Trump aide Stephen Miller, bluntly said Jean-Pierre “is quite incompetent to do the job.” She argued that the former press secretary’s career progress proved that “DEI doesn’t work.” \n\nMiller went on, “She is just another evidence that DEI doesn’t work, whether that’s, you know, an air traffic controller, an air pilot, whether that’s your doctor. You know, you want to hire the best for the role, not just based on skin color.”\n\nHer comments drew immediate pushback from former Hillary Clinton spokesperson Karen Finney, who asked why Karine Jean-Pierre’s identity qualified her as a DEI hire, but Karoline Leavitt, the current White House Press Secretary, was not labeled the same. “You know, a gay woman is DEI, but a white woman behind the podium right now—which DEI initially started as affirmative action, about affirmatively hiring women and minorities—why is one DEI and the other is not?” Finney asked.\n\nMiller shot back without hesitation. “Why did she get the job over John Kirby? Because as everyone has said this week, she is woefully incompetent,” she said. “Why is she trained every four sentences to say she is a Black, queer, LGBTQ woman? Because that’s how she’s been promoted her entire career.” At that point, Tapper awkwardly ended the segment and shifted to a commercial.\n\nThis confrontation is especially significant as it comes after Jean-Pierre’s widely mocked interview with The New Yorker. The conversation with Isaac Chotiner, which was intended to promote Jean-Pierre’s new book, quickly turned into a rather strange exchange. Critics later described her responses as rambling and incoherent.\n\nNEW: Jake Tapper quickly wraps up segment after Stephen Miller’s wife, Katie Miller, says Karine Jean-Pierre is only relevant because she has been promoted as a “black queer LGBTQ woman.”\nMiller: “Why has she trained every four sentences to say she is a black queer LGBTQ woman?… pic.twitter.com/b9OPV4Wnyw\n— Collin Rugg (@CollinRugg) October 28, 2025\n\nChotiner repeatedly asked Jean-Pierre to clarify her long, circular answers. When asked why she felt Democrats had “betrayed” President Joe Biden, she reportedly circled back to discussing her identity instead. During the Q&A, Jean-Pierre referenced being a Black woman ten times and her LGBTQ status twice.\n\nAt one point, she told Chotiner, “I wish you could walk in my body and live my life,” after being asked about Vice President Kamala Harris’ chances of becoming president. She suggested both Biden and Harris had faced prejudice “from voters and within their own parties.”\n\nChotiner pressed further, saying, “I’m not trying to discount what you’re saying about Harris, but Biden is not an LGBTQ Black woman, and you have the same feelings about how he was treated.” He added, “Sometimes I worry about losing sight of the fact that we’re dealing with a Presidential election here, and the feelings of Joe Biden are less important than the fate of the country.”\n\nJean-Pierre also criticized Democratic leadership, claiming the party has not protected “vulnerable people in the way that it should.” She said, “You also have to think about how I’m thinking about this as a Black woman who is part of the LGBTQ community, and living in this time where I also don’t think Democrats right now are protecting vulnerable people.”\n\nWhen Chotiner challenged her on how that related to Democrats’ concerns that Biden could lose to Donald Trump, she appeared evasive. Her answers included an odd claim that the subtitle of her book, A Look Inside a Broken White House, actually referred to the Trump administration rather than Biden’s.\n\nAsked about Biden’s fitness for a second term, Jean-Pierre insisted she had “never witnessed anything from him” that raised doubts. When Chotiner pointed out that “you watched TV like the rest of us, right?” she conceded that Biden “was aging” but described him as “engaged, on top of policy, and challenging his staff.”\n\n“‘Absolute Train Wreck!’ Political World Unites to Roast Karine Jean-Pierre’s ‘Embarrassing’ New Yorker Interview” – Mediaite #SmartNews https://t.co/KubyqjDPcH\n— BJ Rodrigue (@rodrigue_bj) October 28, 2025\n\nPressed again on whether “it was wise” to believe Biden could serve through 2029, Jean-Pierre said, “It’s not my place to say.” When Chotiner asked what she meant, she replied, “No, no, no. Wait, I’m answering the question. I did not see anything that would cause me concern. That is my answer.”\n\nThe interview drew immediate reactions across the political spectrum. Semafor reporter David Weigel quipped on X, “Turns out you can do a career-ending interview even after your career is over.” Former congressional investigator Paul D. Thacker added, “When even the New Yorker isn’t buying your bulls**t, where else is a Democrat to go?” Others piled on, calling her “completely unemployable” after the piece.\n\nEven journalists such as Chris Cillizza and Washington Post columnist David French expressed confusion. “I honestly don’t know what she was trying to accomplish here,” French remarked.\n\nAs America is seeing more and more intolerance to the LGBTQ+ community under the Trump administration, the confrontation between Katie Miller and Karen Finney following Jean-Pierre’s incomprehensible word salad interview highlights the complexity of the issue from both sides. \n\nWhile one was too focused on making her gender identity the key point of her personality and career, the other was quick to discard her capabilities based on the way she identified herself. It would be interesting to see if there comes any new update regarding the same from other LGBTQ+ members across the political spectrum.","summary":"Katie Miller slams Karine Jean-Pierre’s alleged DEI-driven White House rise.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/ex-white-house-press-secretary-accused-of-using-her-lgbtq-status-and-race-to-boost-career","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Katie-Miller-recently-criticized-Karine-Jean-Pierre.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-29 11:41:03","author":"Pramila Tripathi","authors":["Pramila Tripathi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.409},{"id":373697482,"title":"Lily Allen says ex David Harbour might be the last celebrity she is ever with as she is not looking for 'another famous person' after their divorce","text":"Home and Garden\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Oct 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeft behind by her cruise ship on a deserted island: Questions grow over 'forgotten' woman, 80, who died on first stop of $80,000 dream cruise\n\nAfghan asylum seeker sexually assaulted two women as he delivered takeaways to their homes despite ruling he had overstayed in UK\n\nRoyal biographer claims there is 'a good chance' Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson 'could go to prison'\n\nThe toxic new twist in the Andrew Royal Lodge saga: The real reason royals will do anything to evict Prince has been missed, says AN WILSON... the fate of the monarchy's at stake\n\nThe lump sum conundrum: How one pension mistake has ruined our retirements\n\nKeira Knightley defiantly declares 'I'm a nepo baby' as she proudly credits her famous parents for giving her the 'connections' to become an actress\n\nThe Celebrity Traitors meltdown you DIDN'T see: How star branded Jonathan Ross a 'f***ing snake' and lashed out at BBC cast members in EXPLOSIVE behind-the-scenes rant\n\nHere are the REAL danger signs you're drinking too much.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy SEAN O'GRADY, SENIOR SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:11:15 GMT, 29 October 2025 |Updated:11:30 GMT, 29 October 2025 \n\nLily Allen has said her ex-husband David Harbour may be the last famous person she is with because she doesn't want to date another celebrity again. \nThe singer, 40, who dropped her fifth studio album West End Girl last week, has revealed she's back on the dating scene.\nBut after splitting from the Stranger Things actor after four years of marriage, it seems Lily wants to go in a different direction for her next relationship.\nSpeaking to Interview magazine, Lily was asked if being famous presents a difficulty when trying to use dating apps. \n'It does, because I’m not really looking to go out with another famous person,' she said.\nLily, who did the interview in Los Angeles, also feels it's something of a 'novelty' for British men to date her because she is so well known in the UK. \n\nLily Allen has said her ex-husband David Harbour may be the last famous person she is with because she doesn't want to date another celebrity again\n\nAfter splitting from the Stranger Things actor after four years of marriage, it seems Lily wants to go in a different direction for her next relationship (pictured in 2023) \n'Also, when I go on dates with other people, there’s a bit of a barrier in terms of—not so much here, but in England it’s a bit of a novelty to be on a date with me,' she said. \nLily dropped a hint that she has mended her relationship with David as she insisted she doesn't want 'revenge' on him. \nThe singer, whose new album is about her ex-husband's affair and their split, insisted that her new music isn't meant to be 'cruel' and said she didn't feel like she was being 'mean' by sharing an insight into their break-up publicly.\nDuring a chat with Interview magazine, Lily claimed she now feels 'differently' about their marriage breakdown, after first penning the record in 10 days last December. \nLily's new insight into her former relationship came as her former partner was spotted with her children, Ethel, 13, and Marnie, 12, at Epic Universe in Orlando, Florida, leading to speculation that there had been peace talks between the former couple.\nWhen asked whether the new album is a 'revenge tour', Lily said: 'It isn't. I mean, I wrote this record in 10 days in December, and I feel very differently about the whole situation now. We all go through breakups, and it's always f***ing brutal.\n'But I don't think it's that often that you feel inclined to write about it while you're in it.'\n'That's what's fun about this record; it's viscerally like going through the motions. At the time, I was really trying to process things, and that's great in terms of the album, but I don't feel confused or angry now. I don't need revenge.\n\nWhen asked if she was currently seeing anyone, Lily laughed before teasing Interview Magazine: 'Maybe' (pictured last month)\n\nShe also opened up about navigating online dating while healing from heartbreak, admitting: 'They're awful, especially if you're going through heartbreak'\n'It's not a cruel album. I don't feel like I'm being mean. It was just the feelings I was processing at the time.'\nLily's interview comes as David was said to have been seen with her daughters in a video believed to have been taken on Sunday.\nIt was an astonishing turn of events considering the same weekend he's looking after her children, Lily released her fifth studio album, West End Girl, which publicly humiliates David and brands him a cheating 'sex addict'.\nBut this marked the first public sign of easing tension between the former couple, as it appeared David is still a part of her children's lives despite their bitter break-up.\nLily, who claimed the album is a mix of both fact and fiction, was previously asked by Vogue if David was planning on continuing his stepfather role to her kids. \nLily replied 'You'll have to ask him', but the outing suggested that David still has an active role in her daughter's lives.\nLily has caused a huge stir with her no-holds-barred record West End Girl, which details the breakdown of her marriage to the Stranger Things star.\nThe fallout from their split is revealed in explicit and brutally honest lyrics, where Lily recalls discovering he had cheated on her by finding messages on his phone.\n\nLily's marriage broke down last December after she accused David of having multiple affairs including a three-year affair with a younger costume designer (pictured in 2023)\n\n Lily Allen hints she has mended her relationship with ex David Harbour as she defends 'cruel' album and denies seeking revenge with explicit lyrics \nLily references a mistress called Madeline, who is apparently a construct of several people and seemingly lies at the heart of the issue between her and David.\nCommenting on reports of David being seen out with the children while Lily promotes her new music, some shared their confusion underneath the TikTok post.\nOne person wrote: 'So while she's out there humiliating him, Harbour is on vacation with her kids? I can't cope with this.'\nAnother said: 'So he's there with Lily's children while she promotes an album.'\nAlready at the top of the UK iTunes album charts, the songs have been streamed more than eight million times worldwide on Spotify since their release on Friday. \nTheir troubling relationship started as a dream come true for the unlucky-in-love singer.\nA year after they met, the pair wed in Las Vegas, joined only by Ethel and Marnie, and Lily shared pictures of her daughters celebrating by eating hamburgers outside the chapel with their new step-father.\nBut, as she alleges in the 'tell-all' album, her landing a role in 2:22 A Ghost Story on the West End in 2021 cemented the beginning of the end, as he was unsupportive and asked for an open marriage, but eventually 'broke the rules' and cheated on her.\nNow public enemy number one, the internet is awash with calls for David's whereabouts, imagining him hauled up in his Brooklyn apartment, ordering take-out to the Brooklyn townhouse they once shared [but are now selling] and cowering with shame.\nDavid, who has no children of his own but grew close to Allen's daughters over their four-year marriage, was reportedly not keeping a low profile and chatting to fans at the theme park as he accompanied the girls and a group of their friends.\nMeanwhile, Lily has been celebrating the release of the album, recorded in Los Angeles, by giving various interviews across the Atlantic, discussing David and her daughters.\nDavid HarbourLily AllenStranger Things\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLily Allen says ex David Harbour might be the last celebrity she is ever with as she is not looking for 'another famous person' after their divorce\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 10\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

So what happened? I was fined on the spot, £100 for a poo she didn't do.'\nShe added that she knew it was a legal requirement to clean up mess after dogs, but not any rule about carrying bags.\n'I honestly thought that I would be giving words of advice, told off, told what the law was so that I knew for next time, but there was no movement,' she said.\nThe baffling fine comes after a woman was slapped with a £150 penalty by council officers in Richmond, west London, after pouring the remnants of her coffee down the drain.\n\nPaula (pictured) said she was stopped by a council officer in Northampton town centre and fined for not carrying a waste bag\n\nPaula, who asked not to share her surname, described the enforcement officer as 'polite, but very firm,' and felt she 'was an easy target'.\nA West Northamptonshire Council spokesperson said: 'It's really important that if people walk their dogs in a Public Spaces Protection Order (PSPO) area they have the means to pick up after them in case they foul in a public area.'\nEstablished in 2014, PSPOs allow councils to set local rules to tackle community issues. \nThe council spokesperson said officers will fine dog owners who do not have a means of cleaning up, as part of PSPO requirements.\nPaula was one of hundreds of people who shared their story through Your Voice, Your BBC after a woman in west London was fined £150 for pouring coffee down a road gully. \nBurcu Yesilyurt, from Kew, west London, said she tipped a small amount of the drink from her reusable cup down the road gully because she didn't want to spill it on the bus.\nBut moments later, she was 'shocked' to see three male enforcement officers 'chasing' her down the street as she stood at the bus stop near Richmond station.\nThe officers fined her £150 under Section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, reduced to £100 if she paid within 14 days. \n\nBurcu Yesilyurt (pictured) was slapped with a £150 fine by council officers after pouring the remnants of her coffee down the drain\n\n Council vows not to hand out fines for pouring coffee down the drain after woman's £150 penalty \nRichmond-upon-Thames Council insisted its officers 'acted professionally and objectively' and were 'justified' in issuing the fine. \nThe council later said it had cancelled the fine and is 'reviewing our advice on the disposal of liquids in a public place'.\nAlso in west London, a woman said she was fined for fly-tipping after an unopened envelope with her name on was found in an alley near her home.\nAfter receiving the council letter, Victoria said she was 'shaking' and that she 'burst into tears'.\nShe responded to the council letter to say she had never seen the envelope, but she still the £400 to avoid the sum rising to £600.\nHowever, she later had the fine cancelled and refunded after contacting her local councillor. \nAn Ealing Council spokesperson said they had followed the 'usual process' of locating the parcel in a fly tip which contained the resident's details.\nHowever, they added that the fine was incorrect and issued an apology to Ms Wells.\nIn Birmingham, a man said he was given a £100 fine for dropping a strawberry stalk down a roadside drain during the city's bin strike.\n\nBe the first to commentBe one of the first to commentComments\n\nWas the £100 fine fair?Comment now\n\nKleo Papas, 58, who was on a work trip in Birmingham, said he was given a £100 fine for dropping a strawberry stalk down a roadside drain during the city's bin strike\nKleo Papas, 58, who was on a work trip, could not find a bin when finishing a strawberry, so he decided to drop it down a drain.\nAn enforcement officer from the council then approached him, saying he 'got all that on camera'.\nHe believed that because it was organic material it was fine to go down the drain, adding that if he had 'thought that constituted littering, [he] would have just put it in [his] pocket'.\nMr Papas appealed the fine but was unsuccessful and said he paid the £100 fine, which he felt was excessive.\nA Birmingham City Council spokesperson said: 'We cannot find any record of Mr Papas receiving a FPN for disposing of a strawberry stalk.'\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nThe dog owner fined £100 for daring to venture out the house without a plastic bag\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 723\n\n Share what you
