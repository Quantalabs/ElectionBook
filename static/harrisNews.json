Harris supported legislation imposing a ban in the Senate but walked back that position after announcing her run for president. “Contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive,” she said on Friday. Harris has not backed away from the Biden administration’s effort to transition the economy to electric vehicles. In fact, she painted Trump as negligent for not investing in their development as president. “I will make sure America, not China, wins the competition for the 21st century,” she said. Still, Harris’s remark suggests a defensive posture on one of the most politically fraught topics for Michigan voters. Flint, the birthplace of General Motors, has lost much of its auto manufacturing over the decades, and Trump argues the phasing out of gasoline cars will accelerate that trend. He appeared in Saginaw, Michigan, on Thursday with a tough-on-China message and the promise of a “manufacturing renaissance” if elected to a second term. Harris’s answer to Trump was to focus on his record as president. She accused him of letting down the working class while noting that auto plants in Warren, Detroit, and elsewhere closed under his administration. In total, the number of auto jobs under Trump grew slightly before the pandemic, while there has been a larger expansion under Biden. “Thousands of Michigan auto workers lost their jobs, and when it came to building the cars of the future, Donald Trump sat on the sidelines and let China dominate,” Harris said. Harris promised investments in union jobs if she is elected and made a show of labor support. Before she appeared onstage, she was introduced by Eric Price, a local United Auto Workers leader, plus Shawn Fain, the UAW president. Meanwhile, she sought to shore up support among young black men with an appearance by basketball legend Magic Johnson. “Our black men, we gotta get them out to vote. Kamala’s opponent promised a lot of things to the black community that he did not deliver on. And we gotta help black men understand that,” Johnson said at the event. In September, Trump made an appearance at the same Flint convention center where Harris rallied supporters on Friday and has used unconventional media this cycle to reach out to the black community. On Friday, the Trump campaign accused Biden of “upstaging” Harris with a surprise press conference held as she campaigned in Detroit. Biden told reporters that he and Harris are “singing from the same song sheet,” a comment Republicans quickly used to tie her to the Biden agenda.","summary":"FLINT, Michigan — Vice President Kamala Harris promised not to ban gas-powered vehicles if elected as president, one day after former President Donald Trump told Michigan voters she would decimate the car industry.

This two-year period was intended to enable individuals to seek humanitarian relief or other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and to work and contribute to the United States,” a DHS spokesperson wrote in an email. The announcement comes a month before the 2024 presidential election when immigration is a top concern for voters and Vice President Kamala Harris has taken hits from former President Donald Trump for her stewardship of the border with President Joe Biden. Under the Biden-Harris administration illegal border crossings reached their highest levels in history, contributing to a majority of the public wanting to see a reduction in overall immigration. The Biden administration announced in late 2022 that immigrants seeking admission from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela would not be released into the U.S. if they crossed the border illegally. Instead, immigrants from those four countries would have the ability to apply from outside the U.S. to be paroled on a two-year basis, which allows the individual to reside in the U.S. without having to make an asylum claim. The government made no promise that the two-year parole status would be continued and Friday’s announcement revealed that immigrants will now be on their own and must leave the country when their parole status expires or find another legal protection that will allow them to remain here. “Those who do not have pending immigration benefits or who have not been granted an immigration benefit during their two-year parole period will need to depart the United States prior to the expiration of their authorized parole period or may be placed in removal proceedings after the period of parole expires,” the DHS spokesperson said. Immigrants were admitted on parole primarily through the CBP One app, a phone application administered by the federal U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency. The Biden administration has allowed 30,000 people to be admitted per month. Immigrants in the U.S. may be able to eligible to apply for temporary protected status, which gives the recipient protection from deportation for 18 months, as well as legal permission to work in the country.

DHS suspended the CHNV program in July following a report by the immigration restrictionist group, Federation for American Immigration Reform, which found that an internal government audit documented a large number of fraudulent applications as the U.S. admitted nearly half a million migrants from four countries.","summary":"The Biden administration will not continue the temporary parole status that allowed immigrants from four countries to be admitted into the United States through the CBP One app, according to the Department of Homeland Security.

The violence escalated early on Tuesday, as Israel launched “limited ground incursions” into southern Lebanon, targeting infrastructure belonging to the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. This followed a week of air strikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrullah and displaced an estimated 1 million of Lebanon’s 5.8 million population. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s bellicose rhetoric has added further fuel to the fire, suggesting in a video message on Monday potential military action against Iran – which leads the anti-Israel “Axis of Resistance” – and even regime change in Tehran. His statements were applauded by Jared Kushner, Donald Trump’s son-in-law and former Middle East policy architect, who exhorted Israel in a lengthy social media post to “finish the job”. Iran wasted no time in responding to the threats, launching a barrage of 181 ballistic missiles at Israeli military targets within 24 hours. The Iranian mission to the United Nations said that any further Israeli aggression would be met with a “devastating response”. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian later addressed Netanyahu directly, warning on X: “This is only a corner of our power. Do not enter into a conflict with Iran.” Netanyahu promptly retorted, claiming Iran had “made a big mistake” and would “have to pay for it”. ‘Escalation dominance’ This hot-tempered back-and-forth exposes a conflict caught in a relentless cycle of escalation. Each time international pressure mounts for a ceasefire in Gaza, Israel ramps up its military activities against Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, shifting diplomatic efforts towards preventing a broader regional war. “Several times during this war, Israel has tried to provoke, essentially, a war between the US and Iran,” said Michael Young, senior editor at the Carnegie Middle East Centre in Beirut. The involved parties find themselves “locked in” to a pattern whereby each seeks to gain “escalation dominance”, he said – aiming to “escalate to levels that the other side cannot”. The current cycle of violence can be traced back to early April when Israel, under pressure from Washington to avoid mass civilian casualties in Rafah, targeted Iran’s embassy complex in Damascus, killing two Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps generals. After intense negotiations via Arab nations aimed at avoiding a widening conflict, Iran launched a largely performative response against Israel in the form of waves of slow-moving drones and cruise missiles, most of which were easily intercepted. Then in late July, as diplomatic momentum again built for a phased resolution to the Gaza conflict, Israel escalated further by assassinating both Fuad Shukr, Hezbollah’s military chief, and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh on successive days. Haniyeh’s killing was particularly provocative, occurring mere hours after Iran’s new president was sworn in and under the noses of Iranian security services. Rather than pursuing a back room de-escalation deal with Tehran, the US reinforced its military presence in the region, deploying additional air, land, and sea forces. This show of strength served as a warning to Iran, which opted to hold back rather than retaliate. The most recent escalation began last month with the detonation of devices used by Hezbollah operatives, culminating in the assassination of Nasrullah in a targeted bombing that destroyed an entire residential block in southern Beirut on September 27. Analysts who spoke to This Week in Asia said they had predicted Iran’s increased involvement, despite its reluctance, given the rising threat of Israeli air strikes. “A significant portion of the US political establishment loathes Iran” and wants Israel to attack it, said Monica Marks, a professor of Middle Eastern politics at New York University Abu Dhabi. US President Joe Biden “is saying he wants regional de-escalation whilst delivering a seemingly endless stream of weapons and political cover to Israel”, she said. “So there is a real likelihood that Israel could escalate this into not only a ground invasion of Lebanon, but a series of more direct military attacks on Iran.” Netanyahu was “seizing the opportunity” to act before November’s presidential election in the US, Marks added. Jonathan Panikoff, a former US deputy national intelligence officer for the Near East, said that Tehran would prefer to stay out of the Hezbollah-Israel conflict unless directly attacked. It would appear Tuesday’s missile strikes against Israel were designed to convey a different message than those in April. This time, Iran offered no advanced warnings through Arab intermediaries, with US officials only receiving alerts hours before the missile launches. In contrast to the slower drones and subsonic missiles used earlier, Iran unleashed supersonic ballistic missiles against military targets in Israel, reducing the window for interception by both Israeli and US forces. Although Iran aimed at specific military installations to avoid civilian casualties, its missile salvo was clearly a retaliation for the recent assassinations of key figures, including Nasrullah, Haniyeh, and Iranian commanders. Threat of all-out war Regardless of what happens next between Israel and Iran, the Netanyahu administration is expected to intensify its military campaign against Hezbollah. The primary objective is to pressure the militant group into withdrawing its forces from the border, allowing the 70,000 or so Israeli citizens who were evacuated from the surrounding area a year ago to return home. Failure to comply could lead Israel to reinstate the buffer zone in southern Lebanon that it previously occupied from 1985 to 2000. However, Israel’s ambitions extend beyond merely securing its northern border – officials aim to “fundamentally alter the threat” posed by Hezbollah, Panikoff said, as many “view this as the right time” to take advantage of the opportunity. Should the conflict escalate, Hezbollah will likely attempt to inflict “as much damage on Israel as possible”, he said. So far, the group has strategically targeted military installations deep within Israel, with its drones and missiles reaching as far south as Haifa, Tel Aviv, and Jerusalem, while mostly avoiding civilian population zones. Both Israel and Hezbollah “are to a certain extent trying to avoid the worst”, Carnegie’s Young said. “The Israeli calculation is that Hezbollah would be willing to absorb its attacks, and not force Israel to embark on a ground war,” he said. But if tensions continue to rise, “a full-scale war leading to significant destruction and loss of life in both Israel and Lebanon is likely,” Panikoff warned. However, he said “a full-scale war could probably be averted” if Hezbollah relocated its Radwan special forces units away from the border, so they were no longer threatening Israeli towns with missile launches. Panikoff said that Hezbollah’s insistence on tying its withdrawal to the cessation of Israeli military operations in Gaza was “disconnected from any strategic reality”. The group’s leadership likely prefers to avoid a full-blown war with Israel, he said. No American president today wants to enter into a war with Iran Michael Young, Carnegie Middle East Centre All the analysts interviewed by This Week in Asia agreed that both US presidential candidates would be keen to sidestep such a conflict. “No American president today wants to enter into a war with Iran,” Young said. “Certainly, the American public would not back such a war.” Similarly, Iran cannot afford to allow “Lebanon to be destroyed and Hezbollah to be greatly weakened” as this would equate to the loss of another regional asset after seeing Hamas “severely weakened in Gaza”. The Palestinian death toll in Gaza has surpassed 41,600 since the conflict began, according to the enclave’s Hamas-run health ministry. Tehran’s strategic calculus will also be influenced by its recent overtures to diplomatically re-engage with the West. In a speech to the UN General Assembly on September 24, President Pezeshkian expressed Iran’s readiness to negotiate with the remaining participants of the 2015 nuclear deal, which aimed to limit Tehran’s nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. The Trump administration’s withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in 2018 as part of a strategy of “maximum pressure” prompted Iran to expand its uranium enrichment and amass near-weapons-grade material. Israel, staunchly opposed to the JCPOA, is determined to prevent any new agreement that might allow the US to refocus its geopolitical priorities on countering China and Russia. “To a certain extent”, both Iran and Israel “are playing the US”, Young said – as renewed Iranian dialogue with Washington could lead to a revival of the nuclear deal, particularly if Kamala Harris were to win the presidency. Even Trump, much preferred by Netanyahu, surprised many by suggesting on September 26 that the US has “to make a deal” with Iran to avoid dire consequences. This is a scenario that Israel “at all costs wants to prevent”, as it aims to maintain its “hegemonic power” in the Middle East, Young said. Estimates from Western think tanks suggest Israel has around 90 nuclear warheads, though it routinely denies possessing any. Analysts say the escalating conflict in the Middle East is compounded by a lack of a coherent strategic vision among the combatants. “Israel does not have a strategy. It has the tactical goal of neutralising its enemies, but not a wider strategy involving a strategic and diplomatic vision,” said Shaiel Ben-Ephraim, an Israeli analyst specialising in the Middle East peace process. Meanwhile, Hamas, under its new leader Yahya Sinwar, is pushing for escalation “so it will remove the Israel Defence Forces’ chokehold” on Gaza, he said. Unless Israel’s tactical military victories are paired with a longer-term political strategy that involves creating a Palestinian state, “you can rest assured that violent resistance against Israel, likely including terrorism, will continue”, said Marks, the politics professor. This could manifest through revitalised factions of Hamas and Hezbollah or new groups yet to emerge, she said. Young agreed, predicting that the conflict in Gaza will endure as “the Israelis are going to try to maintain a presence”. He foresees a future where “the Palestinians will revolt” again, replicating past intifadas.","summary":"As US ally Israel lashes out at Iranian proxies, a perpetual multi-front conflict that threatens to set the whole region ablaze takes shape.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3281139/israel-vs-iran-new-middle-east-forever-war-looms-1-year-gaza-conflict-began","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/04/6a7cd267-7587-46bf-a011-38a2925d05e2_7e886448.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-05 00:00:10","author":"Tom Hussain","authors":["Tom Hussain"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":258527900,"title":"Biden unsure if Netanyahu holding up Gaza deal to influence US election","text":"United States President Joe Biden has said he does not know if Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been dragging his feet on a ceasefire deal in Gaza in order to influence the US election in November. Biden was asked the question directly during a news conference at the White House on Friday, just days ahead of the one-year anniversary of the war, in which at least 41,802 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed. “No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None. None. None. And I think Bibi should remember that,” Biden said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname. “And whether he’s trying to influence the election, I don’t know, but I’m not counting on that.” The Biden administration has for months downplayed the prospect that Israel could be intentionally holding up such a deal, instead regularly laying the blame for breakdowns in talks on Hamas. It has done so despite repeated reports indicating that Netanyahu’s position had shifted throughout the talks, precluding any breakthroughs. Still, some top Democrats have increasingly questioned whether Netanyahu could have an eye on the US election – and the possible victory of former President Donald Trump – in his military calculation. Trump has long been Netanyahu’s preferred occupant of the White House. On the campaign trail, the Republican has attacked the Democratic nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris, over the Biden administration’s inability to reach a deal. “I don’t think you have to be a hopeless cynic to read some of Israel’s actions, some of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s actions, as connected to the American election,” Senator Chris Murphy, a close ally of Biden, told CNN earlier this week. US officials also told The Wall Street Journal in September they did not believe a deal would be reached during Biden’s presidency, which ends in January of 2025. Continued military aid Biden had initially said that Israel supported a ceasefire plan he introduced in May, despite Netanyahu appearing to swiftly contradict the claim. In September, the Israeli prime minister pushed back on a claim from a Biden administration official that 90 percent of the deal had been completed. Later that month, Israel surged its attacks on Lebanon shortly after meeting with US officials pushing for de-escalation. Since then, Netanyahu’s government has ignored appeals from US officials for a pause in fighting as it has upped its operations – including limited ground incursions – in Lebanon. Biden has also opposed Israel striking Iran’s nuclear facilities following an Iranian attack earlier this week. On Friday, he indicated he also opposed any strikes on Iran’s oil facilities, saying: “If I were in their shoes, I would be thinking about other alternatives than striking Iranian oil fields.” Despite Israel continuing to flaunt Washington’s public appeals, the Biden administration has for months avoided leveraging the military aid it provides to its “ironclad” ally. Transfer of power may not be ‘peaceful’ Speaking during the news conference on Friday, Biden also warned that Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, could refuse to accept the outcome of the election on November 5. Trump had spread false claims the 2020 vote was marred by election malfeasance. The statements culminated in his supporters storming the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn Biden’s victory. Trump has continued to cast unfounded doubt that the upcoming election would be fair. Biden said it was notable that Trump’s running mate, Vance, would not confirm during this week’s vice presidential debate that he would accept the outcome of the vote next month. “I’m confident it will be free and fair. I don’t know whether it will be peaceful. The things that Trump has said, and the things that he said last time out when he didn’t like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous,” Biden said.","summary":"White House has for months said Israel is not the main stumbling block in elusive ceasefire talks.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/4/biden-unsure-if-netanyahu-holding-up-gaza-deal-to-influence-us-election?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/AP24278688098512-1728079706.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:57:39","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":-0.367},{"id":258528100,"title":"Ben Horowitz says he’ll donate to Kamala Harris after all","text":"After the podcast where Ben Horowitz repeatedly congratulated himself for being brave enough to support Donald Trump in public, it turns out Horowitz will also be donating to Kamala Harris. Or so he says. “As I mentioned before, Felicia and I have known Vice President Harris for over 10 years and she has been a great friend to both of us during that time,” Horowitz wrote in an email to his venture capital firm obtained by Axios. “As a result of our friendship, Felicia and I will be making a significant donation to entities who support the Harris Walz campaign.” \"“Like, how do you walk that back?”\" I... listen. Two things. First, one of the most striking things about the podcast Horowitz made with his a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen was how focused both men were on who’d take their meetings. Their political commitments in many respects boiled down to who would spend face time with them. Near the end of the podcast, Horowitz told what was (I think?) supposed to be a heartwarming story about hanging out with Trump’s grandkids — and how his reaction to hearing about the assassination attempt on Trump was “Oh my god, Grandpa just got shot.” So you know, the whole thing where Harris has been “a great friend” to both Horowitz and his wife checks out as a political position for him. In some respects, I get it. I too want to see my friends succeed! But second, that crucial Trump endorsement was made before Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race in favor of Harris, and before the enormous outpouring of support for the new Democratic candidate. That meant a16z had already sacrificed any leverage it might have with a Harris administration — and a candidate who made Trump look like less of a sure winner. In the case of a Harris win, these boys were looking at an entire four years without important meetings, and we already know they view that as a dreadful tragedy for the entire nation. In order to regain any possibility of leverage in a potentially Democrat-led government, someone was going to have to eat humble pie, and it sure as shit wasn’t going to be Andreessen. Horowitz, whose support for Trump was termed a “Maga U-turn” by The San Francisco Standard, has a history of donating to progressive causes; Harris, then a senator, was even a guest at a Horowitz backyard barbecue in 2018. “I’m just wondering what they’re gonna do when Kamala wins,” one founder told The San Francisco Standard of the a16z Trump endorsement. “Like, how do you walk that back?” Well, I guess we know now. Horowitz’s email says that he’s had several conversations with Harris and her team — crucial to note here that he got to the candidate herself, given that access is apparently one of Horowtiz’s main political concerns. And so while Horowitz still thinks President Joe Biden is no-good and very bad, he is “encouraged by my belief” in Harris to do good for tech, despite the fact that she has not yet staked out any policy positions. Harris has sort of made overtures on what Horowitz termed “probably the most emotional topic” in the election: crypto. One of her campaign aides has said, “She’s going to support policies that ensure that emerging technologies and that sort of industry can continue to grow,” in response to a question about crypto.

Jodi Ernst introduced this week. By expanding the definition of “aggravated felony” to include sexual assault and aggravated sexual violence, it would make migrant sex offenders eligible for deportation. And that’d be just the start: Per data that Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently coughed up after months of delay to Rep. Tony Gonzales, a jaw-dropping 662,566 migrants with known criminal backgrounds are wandering around the country. That includes 13,099 murderers, another 1,845 accused murderers and some 15,000 convicted of sexual assault, either in the United States or in their home countries. And these are just the criminals that ICE knows about. With more than 1.7 million “gotaways” — illegal border-crossers spotted by Border Patrol but not caught — in the Biden years, plus the unknowable amount who avoided even getting spotted, the actual number is bound to be far higher. It’s not clear how many of these violent lawbreakers entered the country under the Harris-Biden administration (the data has been collected over decades), but it is plain that progresives’ “sanctuary” laws have been protecting them. When local cops aren’t allowed to communicate with the feds, known degenerates are allowed to commit crime after crime and still remain in the United States, terrorizing Americans and fellow migrants alike. In July, an illegal migrant who was accused of raping a pre-teen child in Massachusetts was set free on bail by local authorities, who didn’t even alert the feds about his arrest. He was finally re-arrested in September after ICE tracked him down. All this argues for Ernst’s “don’t let known threats in” approach; we expect she’d be fine with adding the good bits from the “bipartisan” bill, including more resources for the Border Patrol and ICE. And any answer needs to tighten the rules for winning “asylum seeker” status (whereas the bill Harris wants would loosen them. We need to stop the mass movement to get a handle on who’s getting let in. As the number of incoming illegal migrants has reached record highs under the Harris-Biden administration, the number of criminal migrants arrested has dropped 57% drop, the the number of criminals deported, 67%, per former ICE Chief of Staff Jon Feere’s comparison of Biden’s first three years vs. Trump’s. Harris, Biden and Tim Walz claim it’s cruel to enforce on-the-books immigration laws, but unleashing rapists and murderers into American communities is somehow “compassionate.” At least some Democrats in Congress have to know better: Line them up for a new bipartisan bill that will actually ensure we admit only legal migrants who can contribute to the nation from the day they arrive.","summary":"There are a jaw-dropping 662,566 migrants with known criminal backgrounds wandering around the United States, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement data recently released to Rep.

But FEMA faces a multibillion-dollar deficit, even after imposing new spending restrictions last month. The agency is forgoing some ongoing rebuilding projects related to disaster repair to be better financially equipped to face immediate needs related to natural disasters.How FEMA Funding Compares to Ukraine AidSince the war between Russia and Ukraine began in 2022, the U.S. has provided Ukraine with almost $60 billion for weapons and security, according to the Associated Press. However, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an independent, nonpartisan agency, claims that U.S. aid to Ukraine is even higher.\"Congress responded to Russia's invasion of Ukraine with funding of about $176 billion for U.S. agencies to provide arms to Ukraine, aid civilians, impose sanctions, and more,\" the website said.President Joe Biden recently announced an additional $2.4 billion assistance package for Ukraine on September 26.In comparison, in 2022, Congress appropriated $18.8 billion in annual funding for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund, which is the primary funding for domestic disaster relief programs and has appropriated roughly $20 billion each year thereafter. Additional appropriations measured in the billions of dollars were made in 2023 and 2024. Most recently, Congress approved a continuing resolution that provided FEMA with an additional $20 billion in disaster relief funds to be used through December 20.Newsweek reached out to the White House by email for comment.FEMA Funds for Hurricane Helene VictimsMeanwhile, Hurricane Helene ravaged several states last week, killing at least 200 people and leaving many others displaced and without necessary supplies. Some fear the death toll is much higher than what has been reported.On Wednesday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced that FEMA workers were going door-to-door in affected areas to provide residents with immediate relief money worth $750. The $750 is part of a larger effort to provide aid to those impacted by the hurricane.\"FEMA is also providing tens of thousands more dollars for folks to help them be able to deal with home repair, to be able to cover a deductible when and if they have insurance, and also hotel costs,\" Harris said at the time.Despite FEMA's ongoing efforts, several Americans took to social media to express that the aid for hurricane victims wasn't high enough when compared to the funding U.S. has approved for Ukraine since the war with Russia began in 2022.\"Let's check in on our government: Biden announced a new $2.4B aid package to Ukraine last week while Kamala announced today that victims of Hurricane Helene will get a mere $750,\" one post said. \"Oh, and FEMA doesn't have enough money to make it through hurricane season yet spent $640M on illegal aliens.\"\"$2.4B to Ukraine. $750 to the victims of Hurricane Helen $1B+ of FEMA money to illegal aliens No FEMA funds for hurricane survivors,\" another said.\"How is the US GOVERNMENT running out of money for Hurricane Helene victims?!\" one post said. \"They were able to find $63.1 BILLION and counting for Ukraine. FEMA spent over a BILLION on illegal immigrants. But the Americans in Appalachia? $750 bucks. THIS IS AN INSULT.\"Many of the accounts criticizing the government only highlighted the immediate aid money of $750, despite the longer-term efforts by FEMA to help Americans with larger costs, such as housing.FEMA ScrutinyScrutiny about FEMA spending has increased in recent weeks after FEMA  spent money on assisting communities across the country dealing with an influx of migrants through its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). The program had a budget of $640 million for the 2024 Fiscal Year, which ended on September 30.Former President Donald Trump has criticized the SSP, which helps local governments and nonprofits support migrants. However, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security have denied that any FEMA disaster relief funds have gone to the program.\"The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA's disaster-related authorities or funding streams,\" a DHS spokesperson previously told Newsweek.However, claims are now surfacing that FEMA doesn't have enough money to assist those in need after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across several states, including North Carolina.FEMA Director of Public Affairs Jaclyn Rothenberg previously told Newsweek that FEMA has enough funding to support the Hurricane Helene response and any subsequent disasters through December 20.","summary":"FEMA has recently come under scrutiny after Congress approved a continuing resolution that extends agency funding.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/how-fema-disaster-funding-compares-ukraine-aid-1964240","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488176/how-fema-funding-compares-ukraine-aid.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:48:38","author":"Anna Skinner","authors":["Anna Skinner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":258527348,"title":"Biden sees lowest year of illegal immigrant arrests","text":"The drop in unlawful border crossings also means Biden will close out fiscal 2024 with the least amount of illegal immigration of any 12-month period of his presidency. The feat is a turnaround for the Biden administration after sustaining the highest number of illegal immigrant arrests under any president. The decline in border crossings could put Vice President Kamala Harris in a better position politically on the issue of immigration which has been of high concern to U.S. voters ahead of the November election. Just under 56,000 immigrants were apprehended by the Border Patrol attempting to enter the country nationwide last month, bringing the year-long total of arrests to roughly 1.56 million between October 2023 and September 2024, according to an administration official who requested permission to discuss preliminary border data figures Friday evening. The administration official said the September figure at the southern border made it the lowest month since August 2020 and lower than the monthly average in 2019. All but roughly 1,000 of the nearly 56,000 immigrants arrested nationwide occurred at the U.S.-Mexico border. The remaining 1,000 were largely encountered at the Canadian border. In total over the past year, Border Patrol agents encountered 1,557,358 immigrants at the northern, southern, and coastal borders. That figure is down from 2.06 million in 2023, 2.2 million in 2022, and 1.66 million in 2021, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection statistics available online. Immigration has topped voters’ concerns this election cycle and Harris has had to make a case to voters that she can manage the border if elected president despite criticism that she did little in her “border czar” stint to address the root causes of migration. Last week, Harris visited the Arizona border for the first time as the Democratic nominee. She stopped in Douglas to see border fence installed during the Obama administration and the port of entry. The precipitous drop in illegal immigration since last December is a notable change of course for Biden, who oversaw the historic border crisis. The monthly number of arrests has slowly decreased over the past six months, dropping from 250,000 last December to 83,000 in June and falling since then after Biden implemented an executive order this summer that curbed crossings. CBP has attributed several actions to the drop, as well as bilateral talks with Mexican government officials last December that have led to improved cooperation between countries in dealing with illegal immigration. “We have executed the largest surge of removals and disruptive activities against human smuggling networks in the past decade,” said Troy A. Miller, a senior official performing the duties of the commissioner, in a statement in July. “We have redoubled our efforts, in coordination with partners throughout the hemisphere and around the world, to disrupt the criminal organizations and transportation networks who are putting vulnerable migrants in danger while peddling lies and profiting from them.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER In June, Biden took executive action and implemented a new rule to turn away people at the border rather than release thousands who were crossing daily into the interior of the country to await court dates years down the road. Official figures for September border data are set to be released in mid-October. Border Patrol arrests do not include immigrants encountered at the ports of entry.","summary":"EXCLUSIVE —&#160;Arrests of illegal immigrants at the nation&#8217;s&#160;borders&#160;plunged in September to their lowest level under President Joe Biden, according to data reviewed by the Washington Examiner.

Campaigns, political parties, super PACs and the like have poured hundreds of millions of dollars into these swing states and been rewarded with a sky-high stack of polls suggesting the races there are too close to call. But have they ignored other possible battlegrounds in the fight for 88 electoral votes up for grabs? One of polling guru Nate Silver’s lieutenants, Eli McKown-Dawson, argues that’s potentially the case, saying their “model thinks Florida is the 7th-likeliest tipping point state — ahead of states like Nevada where the race is much more even but the number of electoral votes up for grabs is smaller.” Indeed, Florida has 30 electoral votes — five times as many as Nevada and more than any single state conventional wisdom regards as a battleground. And there are structural indications both Republicans and Democrats recognize the battle for the Sunshine State may be a dogfight, despite Republicans having over a million more active registered voters than Democrats after the pandemic led to party switches and an influx of COVID refugees. For starters, Friday former President Barack Obama, who carried the state in 2008 and 2012, endorsed Senate candidate Debbie Mucarsel-Powell in her race against former governor Sen. Rick Scott. The RealClearPolitics polling average shows a 4.3 point spread in favor of the incumbent. The endorsement from Obama, who is stumping for the Kamala Harris campaign down the stretch, is a sign national Democrats, historically reluctant to engage in one of the few states where 2022’s “red wave” manifested as advertised, may play in Florida after all. Of course, the Senate race isn’t the main event, and it’s still an open question whether Harris or Tim Walz campaigns in the state given that they’ve only sent surrogates thus far — especially with Trump up 6 in the RealClearPolitics average of polls. The McKown-Dawson analysis recognizes the long-shot nature of the state, noting Trump has won it twice already and the “once quintessential swing state just isn’t anymore.” But when he poses the seemingly rhetorical question of whether Florida is a “lost cause for Harris that isn’t worth an investment of her campaign’s limited resources,” he says the answer “isn’t that simple,” even though their model gives Harris a 21% chance to win. First, the Silver model sees Harris/Trump as a 3.3-point race — which would put it roughly on par with the Biden/Trump result in 2020. The analysis also notes some individual polls, though not “particularly high-quality” ones, frame the race as being as close as 1 or 2 points. The political professionals diverge on partisan lines on how close Florida actually is. While the Democratic Party didn’t weigh in when asked, GOP Chair Evan Power dismissed the idea the state is a battleground as “fool’s gold” during a recent interview, and he expanded on those points to The Post. “Florida is a safe R state,” he said, contending that polls from the Florida Chamber and Associated Industries of Florida, which are favorable to GOP candidates, are “a lot more reliable than some of these public polls that have always underestimated Trump and Scott.” “The fact is we have registered more Republicans, and when we turn them out it will lead to victories in Florida up and down the ballot,” Power added. A source familiar with the Mucarsel-Powell campaign’s thinking believes voters may split their tickets between Trump and the Democratic Senate candidate, particularly Latino voters. They feel Scott didn’t take them seriously, as evidenced by running fewer ads this cycle than he did in 2018 against Bill Nelson. And they think the race is as close as the closest public polling, which is believed to be more reflective of the 2020-presidential-cycle turnout model than that of the 2022 wave election. Scott’s campaign takes a different tack, asserting the race isn’t particularly close and they’ve heard this line from the opposition party before. “Every election, Florida Democrats say Rick Scott is in trouble, and every election they lose. But national Democrats are free to waste their money if they want. Given their lack of investment this late in the cycle, it seems like they don’t have much confidence in Debbie Mucarsel-Powell’s floundering campaign. We have taken this race seriously since the beginning,” a spokesman told The Post. Partisan framings notwithstanding, the reality is this: The national campaigns may want to ignore Florida and continue to pump money into chasing a dwindling number of undecided voters in the battlegrounds. But that could be at their peril. Democrats likely need to compete again, if only to show they can. And if Republicans somehow lose the Senate seat or the state’s 30 electoral votes, it will be a lesson in how to squander a political advantage that once seemed impregnable.","summary":"Throughout this election, operating assumptions have been that there are seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

The former one-term president and his running mate, a senator from Ohio, cast accuracy as the real looming threat to democracy in America last month and again after Tuesday's vice presidential debate. Their opponents, Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota, by contrast, seem almost agnostic about fact-checking but bemused by the other side's erratic eruptions when debate moderators weigh in. Which raises the question: What does all that tell you about who is more likely to speak the truth as they compete for control of the White House? I've never seen a debate winner complain about fact-checking by moderators. Harris clearly defeated Trump during their lone debate last month. And Trump has wailed since then about the two ABC News moderators who had the audacity to bring clarity to that conversation. Now it's Vance's turn to play victim, even though his debate with Walz on Tuesday evening was widely – and I'd say accurately – judged a draw between the two candidates. How a slight fact-check on the Haitian immigrant lie went poorly The CBS News debate was moderated by Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, who opened by explaining that they would \"enforce the rules and provide the candidates with the opportunity to fact-check claims made by each other.\" While there had been plenty of chatter about not fact-checking the candidates, as the moderators of the ABC News debate did with Trump last month, the rules published by CBS News before the debate did not rule out moderators offering clarifying comments. Still, that became an issue when Brennan asked about immigration issues. Walz knocked Vance for previously saying that \"if I have to create stories\" to get media attention \"then that's what I'm going to do\" ‒ in justifying the senator's debunked claims about legal Haitian immigrants who were drawn to Springfield, Ohio, by open jobs. Walz said those claims \"dehumanize and villainize other human beings.\" Opinion:Who won the vice president debate? Vance and Walz spar on abortion, immigration. Republicans in Ohio, from the governor on down, have said that the claims Vance made and Trump amplified in his debate with Harris – \"They're eating the dogs. ... They're eating the cats.\" – are not true. Vance turned defensive, blaming \"millions of illegal immigrants\" for problems with housing availability and \"overwhelmed\" public schools and hospitals in Springfield and across the country. Brennan attempted to conclude the back-and-forth with this: \"And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status.\" And that's when things went from bad to worse for Vance, who clearly had trouble hearing what was meant to be the final word on the subject come from a mouth that was not his That debate moment made clear what's in store for the rest of this election Vance, openly irritated, tried to keep talking about the topic as O'Donnell attempted to head him off while turning to a question about the economy. That prompted the sound bite from Vance that you'll probably hear plenty of times in the next five weeks: \"The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check.\" It was a moment of open weakness in what had otherwise been a strong, if not always factual, performance by Vance. CBS News then muted Vance's microphone as he delved into a detailed description of how migrants seek legal status in this country. Walz's microphone was also muted as he reacted to what Vance was saying. Opinion:I was wrong about Vance. VP debate shows Republicans can win because of him. That came as an abrupt moment of political parity in a debate where Vance, up to that point, had seemed far more polished and adept than Walz. It was also a signal, as it was last month in the presidential debate, for Trump-Vance ticket allies to start barking at the refs when the game stopped going their way. Time to blame the moderators. 'The moderators were obnoxious' Trump's campaign sent the message as the debate continued, posting video of Vance's exchange with the moderators on social media while claiming, \"They got so annoyed that they cut off his mic.\" U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who long ago tried to fact-check Trump before completely surrendering to his party's titular leader, got the message and posted this complaint about fact-checking two minutes later: \"Once again another major media outlet embarrasses themselves on a debate stage.\" Fox News, of course, chimed in. Political analyst Brit Hume offered this on the channel after the debate was over: \"The moderators were obnoxious – and made it feel like three-on-one on Vance – and Vance was just fine.\" Trump's camp quickly circulated a video of that, too, on social media. If Hume's phrasing – \"three on one\" – rings familiar, it's because that's the same line Trump and his allies have been muttering over and over again since his ABC News debate last month with Harris. Here is how Trump's campaign expressed that sentiment in a news release the day after last month's debate: \"Last night's debate was an indisputable victory for President Donald J. Trump — despite a disgraceful three-on-one format.\" Republicans see fact-checking as unfair Trump has used for nearly a decade a political tactic of playing the victor and victim – always claiming triumph while insisting he had to overcome a rigged system to get there. Vance, not long ago seen as an engaging and interesting intellectual (who detested Trump), has abandoned all that to be Trump's victor-victim disciple. Vance fancies himself as an advocate for free speech. But Trump suggested that ABC News should lose its broadcast license for what he deemed \"unfair\" treatment during his debate. If none of that adds up for you, that's because it's not supposed to. You can't oppose accuracy and make sense. You have to pick. Trump and Vance have clearly chosen, given their aversion to fact-checking.

Vance, the junior Republican senator from Ohio, and Walz, Democratic governor of Minnesota, debated each other in what is likely to be the last match-off before election day. Poll watchers declared the event essentially a tie. According to a CBS News poll, 42 percent of debate watchers said Vance won the debate, while 41 percent thought Walz emerged as the winner. Overall, debate watchers thought the tone of the debate was positive. Seventeen percent called the debate a tie. Speaking on the Ruthless Podcast, Vance said he wasn’t sure how he did during the event until it was over. “You don’t really know when you’re doing this, your adrenaline is going, you’re trying not to say anything stupid. You don’t actually know how it’s going really,” Former President Donald Trump’s running mate said. “But my wife comes out at the very end, just sort of like this one final, you know, segment for the TV cameras. Gwen Walz comes up, my wife comes up, and I look at Usha’s face and I just knew. “Usha doesn’t lie to me and her face especially doesn’t lie to me and I knew that minute that we had had a very good debate.” Vance addressed a snapshot of him from the event that’s now gone viral. In one moment, he’s seen looking into the TV cameras in what social media has called a Jim Halpert from The Office look. The candidate said he was trying to pay attention to the timer right next to the camera so he would be ready for his turn to speak. “The timer is right by the camera,” Vance said. “So I was just, you know, I was trying to pay attention to what [Walz] is saying. But then you have to be ready for when his time is up, because then it’s your turn to speak.” Vance said he could tell Walz was struggling as the CBS News moderators questioned him about whether he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests. The governor said he “misspoke” and was not in fact in Hong Kong at the time, but was there at one point that summer. “It’s like the old Sun Tzu quote, right?” Vance said, referring to the Chinese military general and philosopher. “When your enemy is making a mistake, don’t interrupt him. I was just like, shut up. Do not say a damn thing, JD. Silence.” The quote is often attributed to another famous military strategist, Napoleon Bonaparte. Vance said his ultimate strategy during the debate was to use it as an opportunity to inform voters about Vice President Kamala Harris’s record. “Ultimately, that was the right strategy,” he said. However, Vance himself was perceived to have had rocky moments during the debate, particularly when questioned about Trump’s efforts to change the result of the 2020 election, and when Vance claimed that Trump had “saved” Obamacare, despite his repeated vows and efforts to overturn it.","summary":"‘When your enemy is making a mistake, don’t interrupt him,’ Vance said of his debate performance","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-the-office-meme-b2624208.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/04/23/SEI224105841.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/i57jcVrQ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-04 23:10:05","author":"Michelle Del Rey","authors":["Michelle Del Rey"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":258527930,"title":"Dimon denies Trump endorsement after Truth Social post","text":"JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon is denying claims that he endorsed former President Donald Trump in the upcoming election. Dimon's denial, through reps, came after Trump shared a screenshot of unknown provenance on Truth Social with the claim that his campaign had the backing of the banking bigwig. A rep for Dimon quickly corrected the record, telling CNBC that “Jamie Dimon has not endorsed anyone. He has not endorsed a candidate.” The move was a blow to Trump, who was once rumored to be considering Dimon to lead his Treasury Department. It’s unclear where the post originated. It is still live as of this writing, hours after Dimon’s team denied the endorsement. Trump told NBC News he was not the one to post the endorsement, implying he may not have sole control over his account. “I don’t know anything about it,” Trump said. “Somebody put it up.” Friday’s post wasn’t the first time this cycle that Trump lied about receiving a major endorsement: in August, the ex-president posted AI-generated images touting an endorsement from Taylor Swift to Truth Social. Swift later cited that false endorsement as one of her reasons for speaking out against Trump. The pop star endorsed Kamala Harris on the night of her debate against Trump. Swift shared that the AI-generated pics “really conjured up my fears around...the dangers of spreading misinformation.” Though an endorsement seems unlikely, Dimon has celebrated Trump’s economic and foreign policy record. “Trump was kind of right about NATO,\" Dimon told CNBC in January, adding that the ex-president was \"kind of right about immigration.

Numerous polls show she is closing the gap between herself and former President Donald Trump over who is better equipped to handle the economy—particularly after a report dropped Friday showing job growth exceeding expectations. “This is a great weekend for Harris … because of the dock strike, which could have exacerbated supply and inflation problems, and the big growth in jobs. So, you know, I think the Harris campaign has good reason to celebrate,” Democratic strategist Brad Bannon told the Washington Examiner. The strike, now delayed until Jan. 15, takes a potentially disastrous campaign problem off the table for Harris, particularly as she struggles to reach swing voters on top 2024 matters, such as immigration and the war in the Middle East. Peter Loge, political scientist and director of the School of Media and Public Affairs at George Washington University, told the Washington Examiner the ending of the strike is good for Harris because it’s “one less thing to talk about,” and it would “create an opening for Trump.” “The Trump campaign is saying, in the face of chaos and uncertainty, you need a firm, resolute leader,” Loge said. “The less chaos, the less uncertainty, the better for Harris-Walz. Avoiding a strike takes a bit of chaos and uncertainty off of the table.” Biden administration navigates deal ahead of 2024 election Biden made his first briefing room appearance Friday since taking office, praising the negotiations and tentative agreement made by the International Longshoremen’s Association and United States Maritime Alliance the day prior. “We averted what could have become a major crisis for the country,” Biden said. “I especially want to thank the carriers, the port operators, and the longshoremen union for reaching this agreement at a time when the nation has experienced such terrible devastation from Hurricane Helene,” he added. “It was truly a service to the American people for all these parties to come together and respond to our request to keep the ports open.” Sources close to the president told the Washington Examiner that White House officials began taking a direct interest in the negotiating process in early September, suggesting that Biden himself was personally involved in the administration’s efforts from Sept. 26 to Oct. 3. Those sources gave the Washington Examiner a detailed, day-by-day recounting of the administration’s efforts to avoid, and eventually end, the ILA strike, including five specific meetings between the president’s Cabinet and senior representatives of the carriers, during which the administration pressured USMX to meet ILA’s wage increase demands. The month opened with chief of staff Jeff Zients holding weekly meetings with National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard, acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to understand the “lay of the land” and strategize how to bring both parties to the table. Those convenings progressed into daily outreach to USMX and ILA by the president’s Cabinet in hopes of avoiding major work stoppages. As it became clear that neither USMX nor ILA planned on being the first to broach negotiations, Biden himself met with that team on Sept. 26 and directed them to reach out to both parties on his behalf to speed the process along. The following day, Brainard, Su, and Buttigieg hosted USMX officials at the White House’s Eisenhower Executive Office Building to pressure the carrier to extend a new contract offer, a major roadblock in bringing ILA back into negotiations. USMX had not put forth a new offer since 2023. During that meeting, the Biden administration urged USMX to end the stalemate. “Whether you chose to use your power, that’s your decision,” Brainard left it to USMX, according to a person in the room. That day, Biden also put forward his first public comments about a strike, where he reiterated his belief in collective bargaining and said he would not invoke the Taft-Hartley Act to end a strike. Still, Biden also began directing top administration officials over the weekend to prepare for supply chain disruptions in the event of a strike the following week. Any work stoppages could have caused prices to increase ahead of the holidays or delayed greatly needed aid from reaching people in the Southeast recovering from the recent damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Monday provided another opportunity for Zients, Brainard, Buttigieg, and Su to meet virtually with the USMX CEOs, where USMX proposed its first new offer since last year, which still fell short of ILA’s demands. On Tuesday, the first day of the strike, Biden issued another statement pressuring USMX to put forward a “fair offer,” while Zients looped in Biden’s inner circle of personal, White House advisers, Ben LaBolt, Mike Donilon, and Steve Ricchetti, into the Cabinet-level working group. Wednesday proved a major breakthrough for the Biden team after Brainard successfully got global ships to increase the offer, though sources say it still fell short of ILA demands. Public pressure from the Biden administration, coupled with a 5:30 a.m. call between Zients, his working group, and USMX, finally led to a tentative agreement Thursday. ILA leadership and USMX leadership agreed to a 62% increase in workers’ wages over six years, a significant bump from the 50% wage increase offered earlier in the week. The tentative agreement will boost the hourly wage to $63 per hour, up from $39 per hour under the expired contract. Strategists split on strike’s impact on Harris campaign The delayed strike likely won’t do much for the Harris campaign in the long run in the eyes of Dan Bowling, a visiting professor at Georgia State University’s law school. If the strike had continued, it might have increased inflation and had a severe affect on the supply chain. With the delay, the Harris campaign no longer has to worry about it directly affecting her. “They probably weren’t really hanging it around Kamala’s neck,” Bowling said. “Now, if we had shortages in a couple of weeks, which we might have very well … that would have had a negative impact, definitely on Harris.” Bowling “doubt if it impacts” Harris in the long run as he believes the average voter was not paying attention to the port strike. “I suppose if she had flown in, we had seen her at the bargaining table and coming out, making statements to the press on how things were going, what she was doing … it would have helped her. I don’t think it’s going to make a big difference,” Bowling said. Both Harris and Trump blamed foreign shipping companies for the port strike, releasing similar statements supporting workers demanding a fair share of wages. Trump had worked to try and use the port strike to his campaign’s advantage, arguing that Republicans are the “party of the American worker.” He said at a rally in Michigan on Thursday that “under my leadership, Americans won’t have to go on strike for a better wage or a better life.” He also blamed the strike on “massive inflation” caused by the “Harris-Biden regime.” Loge agreed with Bowling that the average voter, particularly in swing states, likely did not pay attention to the port strike as much as the topics “dominating national and global headlines” — the Israel-Hamas war, damage from Hurricane Helene, and fires in California, to name a few. However, he thinks the tentative agreement is “the best possible result” for the Harris campaign as it shows the economy is moving in a positive direction. “The extent that we’re not having a strike, to the extent that inflation continues to come down, that the economy continues to be settling, helps Harris in general,” Loge said. Loge and Bannon said the delay of the port strike gives Harris a chance to move her economic agenda forward. “The fact that the owners and the workers on the docks were able to come to an agreement, the economy’s on the upswing, and that feelings are better illustrates the fact that there is a possibility to the end of political polarization in American politics if she wins and Trumps loses,” Bannon suggested. “So I think she should say, ‘Good economic times are on the horizon,’ and the hopes of the economy will keep climbing if she’s president and not Trump.’”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris dodged a significant problem this week after the Biden administration helped negotiate a deal that delayed the historic United States port strike until after the 2024 election.

It will end immediately,\" Trump said.

No, maybe not. But the point is, he wants to get to as close to that as humanly possible, which is a remarkable thing for a modern American presidency,\" he said. Suebsaeng then claimed that in late 2020, Trump \"toyed with the idea of pulling federal funding from different states and cities that were not sufficiently ‘pro-cop’ enough for his liking, or didn’t let the police get away with enough degrees of abusive behavior or even alleged racial bias.

Last year, Mahomes and Taylor Swift struck up a bond as they cheered on their respective Kansas City Chiefs beaus Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce. Yet whispers of tension surfaced at the season's start when they were seen seated separately at Arrowhead Stadium. Speculation intensified when Brittany liked an Instagram post from Donald Trump's presidential campaign. Contrastingly, Swift has demonstrated Democratic leanings and recently backed Kamala Harris for the upcoming November election. However, both have made efforts to quash speculation about a bitter WAG dispute, showing unity at Patrick Mahomes' 29th birthday celebration and jointly appearing at the U. S. Open in Flushing Meadows. The Daily Mail reports that a peace accord was reached between Swift and Mrs. Mahomes last August, agreeing to avoid political chat. Nevertheless, Brittany took to Instagram on Thursday with a thought-provoking phrase: \"Be the reason why people believe in beautiful souls, kind hearts, and good energy. Never stop being a good person.\" Former GOP candidate Trump hasn't shied away from commenting on the rumoured rift. After Swift's public backing of Harris, Trump stated on his Truth social platform: \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT! \". During an interview on \"Fox and Friends\", Trump expressed his preference for Brittany Mahomes, stating: \"Well, I actually like Mrs. Mahomes much better, if you want to know the truth,\" and noting that she is a strong supporter of his. However, Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris could have a significant impact on the closely contested election. Her Instagram post backing Harris garnered over 11 million likes and sparked a surge in online voter registration. Following the September 11 debate between Trump and Harris, Swift announced: \"I will be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in the 2024 Presidential Election. I'm voting for Kamala Harris because she fights for the rights and causes that I believe need a warrior to champion them.\" \"I think she is a steady-handed, gifted leader and I believe we can accomplish so much more in this country if we are led by calm and not chaos.

Trump appeared next to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp near Augusta for the first time since the former president attacked him for refusing to help him overturn the 2020 election results in the battleground state. The two recently made up privately, and on Friday afternoon stood before piles of supplies that included Huggies baby diapers, other paper products and water in front and behind a table and podium. Trump on Friday afternoon said Kemp was doing a ‘fantastic job’ on recovery efforts. Kemp returned the praise. Former President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump (left) shares a moment with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp (right) after addressing the media during a news conference in the wake of damage and recovery from Hurricane Helene in Evans, Georgia (Picture: EPA) ‘I want to thank President Trump for coming back to our state a second time… and keeping the national focus on our state as we recover,’ he said. The governor left the pavilion where the press conference was held just as Trump answered questions from the media, and in the process attacked President Joe Biden. Trump lost Georgia to Biden by fewer than 12,000 votes in the last election cycle. Trump’s efforts to subvert the election results there led to his indictment and an ongoing legal case. On Friday, Trump seemed to make a rare confession that he had lost in the Peach State. ‘I won easily in 2016,’ Trump said. ‘We actually were very close last time.’ Former President and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said Georgia Governor Brian Kemp did a ‘fantastic job’ with Hurricane Helene relief efforts (Picture: EPA) After Trump left, National Guard service members started taking away the toilet paper, diapers and supplies. Trump earlier visited the Columbia County Performing Arts Center in Evans, which was badly bettered by Helene after the Category 4 storm landfall in Florida on September 26. It is not the first time Trump has been surrounded by somewhat comical products to make a point. In August, Trump in New Jersey pitched his economic plan and blamed his 2024 opponent Kamala Harris for rising prices while surrounded by pastries, pie, sweet cereals and other sugary breakfast foods.

It’s a triumph of modern innovation: The devices connect to low-orbiting satellites, allowing first responders to communicate and providing 30 days of free internet access to residents of storm-ravaged areas who’d otherwise be completely cut off. Of course, as Musk himself pointed out, Starlink likely would’ve already been up and running in some of these areas if the Harris-Biden Federal Communications Commission hadn’t slammed the breaks on a $885 million grant to SpaceX to provide broadband to rural communities back in 2022. That Musk needs to step in at all is another indictment of Harris-Biden bungling. The 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law set aside $42 billion-with-a-B to build broadband infrastructure in rural and underserved communities; so far, Harris-Biden haven’t connected anyone. Their “Broadband Equity Access and Deployment” program just reached it’s “year of execution” this year; now comes its four-year timeline for “implementation” — a level of inefficiency that only government can get away with. Sorry, Helene victims. Kam and Joe will have you covered in 2028 . . . maybe. It’s hardly the first time Musk has come to the rescue: See the use of SpaceX’s Crew Dragon to retrieve astronauts Suni Williams and Butch Wilmore, whose “one week” visit to the International Space Station has stretched to months thanks to poor decision-making by NASA and a faulty Boeing craft. Elon also sent thousands of Starlink kits to Ukraine in the early of the Russia invasion — a huge boon to Kyiv’s defense, as it enabled communication and drone warfare in areas where both would have otherwise been impossible. Musk is reviled by the left because of his commitment to protecting free speech, even the speech of (gasp!) conservatives. But when the feds biff it, he has repeatedly jumped in to pick up the slack. Donald Trump’s already embraced Musk’s call for a government efficiency commission; Elon might even head it.

His disdain for the sanctity of our Constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power should disqualify him from the office of president ever again. He doesn’t understand the meaning of this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American.” Springsteen said that Kamala Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, “are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone, regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity, and they want to grow the economy in a way that benefits all, not just a few like me. On top, that’s the vision of America I’ve been consistently writing about for 55 years.” He concluded: “Now, everybody sees things different, and I respect your choice as a fellow citizen. But like you, I’ve only got one vote, and it’s one of the most precious possessions that I have. That’s why come Nov. 5 I’ll be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. Thanks for listening.” The news of his endorsement is hardly surprising, as Springsteen was a vocal supporter of Barack Obama and Joe Biden, and endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016 when she went up against Trump. Springsteen joins the likes of Taylor Swift, Oprah, Sigourney Weaver, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, George Clooney, Beyoncé, Charli XCX, Billie Eilish and Chappell Roan, who have all thrown their support behind Harris.","summary":"Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Kamala Harris and labelled Donald Trump as &#8220;the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.&#8221; ADVERTISEMENT Legendary &#8216;Born in the USA&#8217; singer Bruce Springsteen has endorsed Kamala Harris for president, adding his name to a long list of celebrities backing the Democratic nominee.

Gavin Newsom generally appears eager to expound on ways to fix California’s housing crisis. Not to mention the importance of managing the state’s fiscal responsibilities in the face of uncertain budget projections. Yet when it comes to three November ballot measures that could have massive impacts on the state’s housing market and future spending, he’s had little to say. Asked on Friday whether he supports two bond measures that would allow the state to borrow $20 billion in total for school infrastructure upgrades and climate projects, he declined to offer a position. “To be candid with you, I haven’t even had a chance to review in detail everything that’s in front of the voters,” Newsom said at a virtual news conference announcing state grants to help cities and counties clear homeless encampments. At an earlier news conference last month, Newsom had the same explanation in response to a question about his stance on a measure that would allow local governments to significantly expand rent control. It followed a separate question about whether he would raise money to campaign against another high-profile ballot measure to increase penalties for retail theft and drug crimes that he and his allies have vocally opposed. “Do I have to raise money for (the rent control measure), too?” he responded in jest. So far, Newsom has only taken a position on two ballot items: the crime measure, and a complicated proposition he also opposes that would extend a tax on health care plans, which could end up costing the state between $1 billion and $2 billion a year in the short-term, according to the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office. Other measures on the ballot include proposals to raise the state minimum wage to $18, enshrine in the state constitution the right to marry, regardless of sex or race, and lower the margin needed to pass local infrastructure and affordable housing bonds to 55%. On Friday, Newsom said he plans to “be presenting at least my point of view” on the November ballot “at an appropriate time and place,” but didn’t offer more details. Ballots are expected to begin arriving in mailboxes around the state next week. Why might Newsom not have had the time to review the measures going before voters? “It’s hard when you’re running for president,” quipped David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University. McCuan said the conventional wisdom among politicos is that Newsom is angling for a future presidential run whether or not Vice President Kamala Harris wins in November. He’s worked hard to raise his national profile over the past year — whether through international trips or a CNN debate with Florida Gov. Ron Desantis — and his goal is to appear “less like the poster child of left-coast liberalism,” McCuan said. That means being careful not to align himself with expensive or potentially controversial ballot measures, which also may end up losing on Election Day. “If you take a position on ballot measures, most of which fail, you also run the risk of attaching yourself to the coin-flip of a campaign,” McCuan said. Newsom may have learned that lesson in March when Proposition 1, his $6.4 billion mental health bond, underperformed expectations and barely won voters’ approval. “The egg on your face that partially happened in the primary, you don’t want to be repeated in the general,” McCuan said.","summary":"He hasn't had the chance to review them, he says.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/04/newsom-ballot-measures-prop-36-housing/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/California-AI-Regulation-Deepfakes_71926.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:47:05","author":"Ethan Varian","authors":["Ethan Varian"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":258524224,"title":"Pro-Trump Mayor Rips 'Counterproductive' FEMA Accusations","text":"Knox County, Tennessee, Mayor Glenn \"Kane\" Jacobs said that false claims about the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) response to Hurricane Helene are \"counterproductive\" to officials' recovery efforts in states hit by the storm last week.\"To my knowledge, FEMA, TEMA [Tennessee Emergency Management Agency], nor anyone else is confiscating supplies,\" Jacobs, a WWE Hall of Famer and GOP Tennessee delegate wrote on X (formerly Twitter) early Friday morning. \"Please quit spreading those rumors as they are counterproductive to response efforts.\"The statement comes as former President Donald Trump continues to push unsubstantiated claims that FEMA funding was given to undocumented migrants, leaving the agency with \"no money.\" The White House has said that such claims are \"absolutely false.\"Trump repeated the accusations during a rally in Georgia on Friday, claiming that \"a billion dollars was stolen from FEMA to use it for illegal migrants, many of whom are criminals, to come into our country, and FEMA is now busted.\"Reached for comment on Friday, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt doubled down on the former president's accusations.\"Kamala Harris stole $1 billion from FEMA to pay for illegal [immigrant] housing, and now there's nothing left for struggling American citizens,\" Leavitt told Newsweek. \"President Trump is leading during this tragic moment while, once again, Kamala leaves Americans behind.\"The claims have also been pushed by allies of Trump, including his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., and Texas GOP Governor Greg Abbott. However, while FEMA distributes money to support government agencies and nonprofits that assist migrants in the United States, that money does not come out of FEMA's budget.FEMA has also denied claims spreading online that the agency is asking for cash donations and turning away volunteers on the ground. The agency wrote on its webpage dedicated to fact-checking such rumors, \"FEMA does not and will not ever take donations from survivors and rumors of FEMA armed guards stopping vehicles with donations or taking donations from organizations are absolutely false.\"Jacobs, a supporter of Trump, said in his X post on Friday, \"If everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great.\"North Carolina state Senator Kevin Corbin released a statement Thursday denying the \"conspiracy theory junk that is floating all over Facebook\" about emergency response efforts to Helene, including that \"FEMA is stealing money from donations, body bags ordered but government has denied, bodies not being buried\" or that the \"government is controlling the weather from Antarctica.\"\"PLEASE help stop this junk,\" added Corbin, a Republican. \"It is just a distraction to people trying to do their job.\"\"Folks, this is a catastrophic event of which this country has never known,\" his statement said. \"It is the largest crisis event in the history of [North Carolina].

Five of those workers have been rescued as of Wednesday. Two of them were confirmed dead.FEMA had asked for $33.1 billion in the 2025 fiscal year budget that began on October 1, although Congress approved $20 billion in relief funding as part of a stopgap measure passed last week as lawmakers continue to work on next year's funding. Several Republican lawmakers voted against extending FEMA's funding as part of the stopgap bill's vote on September 25.Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said on Wednesday that FEMA has enough funding to meet the \"immediate needs\" of communities hit by Helene but that the agency \"does not have the funds to make it through the season.\"","summary":"The former president has continued to push claims that FEMA is out of funding because it redirected money to help migrants.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/pro-trump-mayor-rips-counterproductive-fema-accusations-1964228","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488161/pro-trump-mayor-rips-counterproductive-fema-accusations.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:44:25","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.612},{"id":258525088,"title":"Revealed: The real reason why people are leaving Donald Trump’s rallies as he is still on stage","text":"One of Donald Trump’s favorite and most frequent boasts is about his rallies, and the size of the crowds he pulls in to see him speak. Over the past months the former president has seemingly become more and more obsessed with attendance, as well as his ratings and other optics – so much so that it has become a target of jabs and jokes by the Democratic party. However despite his claim that “nobody” leaves his rallies, made at a recent town hall event in Flint, Michigan, it seems that that is not quite true. In fact, scores of punters have been known, and seen on live broadcasts, to be leaving the events early. Trump has appeared to become more frustrated and fixated with crowd size ever since Kamala Harris needled him over it during their presidential debate, when she suggested people leave early out of “exhaustion and boredom.” “She said people start leaving, people don’t go to her rallies there’s no reason to go,” Trump shot back, while Harris laughed silently. “People don’t leave my rallies, we have the biggest rallies, the most incredible rallies in the history of politics.” However, interviews conducted by the Washington Post of various supporters leaving the rallies, found that among the things affecting their decision were Trump’s tardiness, the length of his speeches, and his rhetoric. At a recent rally in Las Vegas, a Post reporter standing by the door counted more than 200 people leaving in the first 20 minutes. According to the outlet one attendee said they were still pro-Trump, but that he would have said “You’re fired” if anyone else had been as late as he was. The ex-president was reportedly an hour late taking the stage. Anastasia Bennett, 22, told the outlet that she had become tired of the former president’s constant insults – she now intends to vote for Harris. “It was the insults and just being an hour late,” she said. At a rally in Tucson, Arizona Carlos Chaboya, 65, said that he had arrived for the rally at 8.30am and was still one of the last to be let in. He had to leave early because he had to fix the internet for his daughter at home. “I gotta get it back up for her, so I’m gonna go do that,” Chaboya, who is retired, told the Post. Other guests have expressed frustration that even after driving long distances to see Trump speak and waiting for hours, they are still denied entry. The former president has seemed undeterred by concerns of his length, and has reportedly ignored advice to cut down on time by advisors. “They want a show. They want two hours,” he previously told an ally, who spoke to the Post on condition of anonymity. However, some within the Trump campaign are still onboard with the president’s rhetoric around his speeches. “The fake news media never wants to report the truth about President Trump’s rallies: they are the biggest political events in history,” Karoline Leavitt, a Trump campaign spokeswoman, said in a statement. “Everywhere President Trump goes, thousands of supporters show up to see him, waiting in line for hours to hear him deliver his uplifting message to make America strong, safe, and wealthy again.”","summary":"Over the past months the former president has seemingly become more and more obsessed with attendance – amid claims that his fans are leaving early ‘out of frustration and boredom’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-people-leaving-rally-reason-b2624212.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/04/16/SEI222951488.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/sltzmnoN-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:42:55","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.106},{"id":258524738,"title":"Skins star April Pearson 'reveals she is \"still dealing\" with effects of filming nude scenes' at seventeen on the raunchy E4 drama - after admitting to not feeling protected on set","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Friday, Oct 4th 2024 1AM 7°C 4AM 7°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement It's a year since Hamas took away my beautiful girl... my heart is breaking a little more every day, says mother of the only British hostage still in Gaza as she pens moving letter that she hopes will reach her alive Burglar breaks into woman's home, hangs up her washing, puts away her shopping and empties bin - before leaving note telling her to 'be happy' Bezos's billion-dollar secret: Amazon founder reveals how a one-hour ritual led to his success BORIS JOHNSON: I fear for the Falklands now Starmer has been exposed as a spineless Leftie surrenderist fraud Why I ghosted best friend who helped me through toughest times of my life Woke exam chiefs ban 'problematic' words including 'immigration' and 'homosexuality' from papers... as they tell history teachers not to use 'medieval' RICHARD EDEN: Another loss for Emma Raducanu as Porsche take back freebie... three years after stunning US Open win 'I did nothing wrong': Sven-Goran Eriksson's defiant blast from beyond the grave on Ulrika Jonsson, Faria Alam and his red-hot love life in an exclusive extract from his memoir 'Amanda went too far': The very curious backstory to Abbington's extraordinary Newsnight interview.

Read More The dark side of Skins: How the controversial teen drama which glamourised drugs and partying left its young cast feeling 'unprotected' April previously spoke bout her time on the show on her podcast Are You Michelle From Skins? saying: 'At the time you're young and you don't know any better'. 'You don't really know what to say, to speak out, is this okay… And as with a lot of victims of trauma, you look back at it and think: 'Yeah, that was f***ed up.'' She went on: 'There's a difference between being officially old enough and mentally old enough. I was having this conversation with my husband and I was saying I do feel like I was too young, I feel like I wasn't protected.' April was joined for the chat by Laya Lewis, who played Liv Malone in seasons five and six, and had similar experiences. Laya was 18 when she first starred in the show, and claimed this meant she had more sex scenes than her other cast members. She reflected: 'I do think fair enough, we are actors and we are acting, but I think if you want to pluck children out of the street, which is essentially what they were doing to have this authentic onscreen thing going on, there needs to be a bit more help. But now according to reports April said she was still coming to terms with certain scenes filmed describing that time in her life as 'weird' and 'not all the time pleasant' April previously spoke bout her time on the show on her podcast Are You Michelle From Skins? saying: 'At the time you're young and you don't know any better' (pictured April and Mike Bailey) Meanwhile Laya Lewis (R) was 18 when she first starred in the show, and claimed this meant she had more sex scenes than her other cast members 'Talk through things, it was just a bit much to be bang, day one, here you are.' The two actresses continued to claim that other cast members have 'felt the same' following the show ending and said that things have changed since Skins aired. April told her fellow Skins alum: 'Laya, you're not the first person to have said you've carried some negativity from that experience 'We're talking seven series of the same show and everyone feeling the same, certainly the women and some of the men I have spoken to feel the same. 'Nowadays you have an intimacy co-ordinator as a standard for nude, intimate scenes and that just simply wasn't a thing.' Most recently, Kaya Scodelario, who played Effy Stonem, claimed there was no safeguarding for her as teen while filming Skins and there was nobody to 'check they [the cast] were okay'. Speaking on the Dish podcast with Nick Grimshaw and Angela Harnett, Kaya said: 'Back then there wasn't the same amount of safeguarding with young actors, there wasn't anyone checking if we were okay.' Sex scenes were filmed without intimacy coordinators and there was no such thing as aftercare. Most recently, Kaya Scodelario, who played Effy Stonem, claimed there was no safeguarding for her as teen while filming Skins and there was nobody to 'check they [the cast] were okay' (pictured on the show) Last year, series one and two star Nicholas (pictured) admitted he's never an episode of his cult hit show Skins, and he doesn't plan to anytime soon Meanwhile Last year, series one and two star Nicholas admitted he's never seen an episode of his cult hit show Skins, and he doesn't plan to anytime soon. The actor played Tony Stonem, the central character to series one and two, and he claimed that he believes it would be 'too painful' for him to watch the show. Speaking on Hits Radio Breakfast, told Tom Green: 'I've never watched it. Maybe at some point, I think it would be too painful for me to watch. 'I don't enjoy watching myself. I feel like, I don't know, I shrink away from this. Maybe when I'm like 80? If I make it to 80...' Since cast members have spoken out, the writers issued a statement, which read: 'We're deeply and unambiguously sorry that any cast member was made to feel uncomfortable or inadequately respected in their work during their time on Skins. We're committed to continually evolving safe, trustworthy and enjoyable working conditions for everyone who works in the TV industry.'

The actress, 35, played Michelle in the E4 series, which followed the hedonistic lives of a group of Bristol-based sixth formers, for two series between 2007 and 2008, alongside the likes of Nicholas Hoult and Dev Patel. April, who was 17 at the time of filming, has previously been candid about experiences behind the scenes and admitted to 'not feeling protected' on the set. But now according to The Sun April said she was still coming to terms with certain scenes filmed describing that time in her life as 'weird' and 'not all the time pleasant'. The publication reports that during a TikTok Q&A with fans one asked: 'Did you guys actually have to get naked in Skins? If so, weren't you uncomfortable'.

Read More The dark side of Skins: How the controversial teen drama which glamourised drugs and partying left its young cast feeling 'unprotected' April previously spoke bout her time on the show on her podcast Are You Michelle From Skins? saying: 'At the time you're young and you don't know any better'. 'You don't really know what to say, to speak out, is this okay… And as with a lot of victims of trauma, you look back at it and think: 'Yeah, that was f***ed up.'' She went on: 'There's a difference between being officially old enough and mentally old enough. I was having this conversation with my husband and I was saying I do feel like I was too young, I feel like I wasn't protected.' April was joined for the chat by Laya Lewis, who played Liv Malone in seasons five and six, and had similar experiences. Laya was 18 when she first starred in the show, and claimed this meant she had more sex scenes than her other cast members. She reflected: 'I do think fair enough, we are actors and we are acting, but I think if you want to pluck children out of the street, which is essentially what they were doing to have this authentic onscreen thing going on, there needs to be a bit more help. But now according to reports April said she was still coming to terms with certain scenes filmed describing that time in her life as 'weird' and 'not all the time pleasant' April previously spoke bout her time on the show on her podcast Are You Michelle From Skins? saying: 'At the time you're young and you don't know any better' (pictured April and Mike Bailey) Meanwhile Laya Lewis (R) was 18 when she first starred in the show, and claimed this meant she had more sex scenes than her other cast members 'Talk through things, it was just a bit much to be bang, day one, here you are.' The two actresses continued to claim that other cast members have 'felt the same' following the show ending and said that things have changed since Skins aired. April told her fellow Skins alum: 'Laya, you're not the first person to have said you've carried some negativity from that experience 'We're talking seven series of the same show and everyone feeling the same, certainly the women and some of the men I have spoken to feel the same. 'Nowadays you have an intimacy co-ordinator as a standard for nude, intimate scenes and that just simply wasn't a thing.' Most recently, Kaya Scodelario, who played Effy Stonem, claimed there was no safeguarding for her as teen while filming Skins and there was nobody to 'check they [the cast] were okay'. Speaking on the Dish podcast with Nick Grimshaw and Angela Harnett, Kaya said: 'Back then there wasn't the same amount of safeguarding with young actors, there wasn't anyone checking if we were okay.' Sex scenes were filmed without intimacy coordinators and there was no such thing as aftercare. Most recently, Kaya Scodelario, who played Effy Stonem, claimed there was no safeguarding for her as teen while filming Skins and there was nobody to 'check they [the cast] were okay' (pictured on the show) Last year, series one and two star Nicholas (pictured) admitted he's never an episode of his cult hit show Skins, and he doesn't plan to anytime soon Meanwhile Last year, series one and two star Nicholas admitted he's never seen an episode of his cult hit show Skins, and he doesn't plan to anytime soon. The actor played Tony Stonem, the central character to series one and two, and he claimed that he believes it would be 'too painful' for him to watch the show. Speaking on Hits Radio Breakfast, told Tom Green: 'I've never watched it. Maybe at some point, I think it would be too painful for me to watch. 'I don't enjoy watching myself. I feel like, I don't know, I shrink away from this. Maybe when I'm like 80? If I make it to 80...' Since cast members have spoken out, the writers issued a statement, which read: 'We're deeply and unambiguously sorry that any cast member was made to feel uncomfortable or inadequately respected in their work during their time on Skins. We're committed to continually evolving safe, trustworthy and enjoyable working conditions for everyone who works in the TV industry.'

With then-Vice President Joe Biden by his side, Obama signed 'Obamacare' into law on March 23, 2010. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Obama is headed first to Pittsburgh on Oct. 10, according to Hannah Hankins, a communication director at the Office of President Barack Obama—full details on the Pennsylvania trip and the rest of Obama’s trips have not yet been revealed, but he will continue to hold rallies in battleground states through Election Day, Hankins said. By joining Harris on the trail, Obama may be resurrecting the “yes, we can” ethos of 2008, when the campaign enlisted supporters “to do the difficult and often socially risky work of having real conversations with friends and neighbors about the election,” Liz McKenna, an assistant professor at Harvard University and political sociologist, told Forbes. A critical and often overlooked strategy from the Obama campaign was to organize local teams of supporters, rather than paid canvassers or out-of-state volunteers, to do the majority of in-person “get out the vote” McKenna said. Sophisticated targeting and digital tactics, now standard practice, were another pioneering strategy in the 2008 Obama campaign, Steve Caplan, an advertising expert and adjunct instructor at the University of Southern California, told Forbes. The coming Obama rallies may also become a source of content for future Harris advertising that can be amplified by digital media, a tactic used during the Obama campaigns, Caplan said. How Is Harris’ Campaign Similar To Obama’s? Harris’ campaign has hired key Obama pollsters, speechwriters, aides, strategists and advisers like David Plouffe, Obama’s 2008 campaign manager; Stephanie Cutter, a former deputy campaign manager and strategist; and Mitch Stewart, an organizing operative, among others. The two politicians differ, but the buzz around Harris’ campaign compares to Obama’s 2008 campaign by promoting a positive outlook, Jamal Simmons, a former Harris adviser, told Reuters. Simmons is pointing to Harris’ campaign promotion of “a new way forward” with joy and positivity, while Obama’s campaign became associated with hope and change, a winning message considering the sweeping victory it brought. “This is already a sharp contrast to the Clinton 2016 and Biden 2020 campaigns, which did not have the same authentic groundswell of enthusiasm,” McKenna said. Other similarities exist in the campaigns through the mass training events called “Camp Kamala,” reminiscent of “Camp Obama” programs from 2007. But the Harris campaign has operated for far less time, so “Camp Kamala” is focused on last-minute mobilization tactics such as phone calls and door knocking, while the “Camp Obama” events were dayslong sessions held a year before the election to teach about grassroots organizing and leadership, McKenna said. The Harris campaign’s efforts on TikTok and with online jokes reaching younger audiences (even if the memes have often been user-generated and Trump has a substantially larger social media command) garnered significant attention after she launched her campaign in July. Key Background After endorsing Harris in July and calling her the successor of his movement and coalition (“Now the torch has been passed,” he said in his Democratic National Convention speech), Obama’s support in fundraising events and content has raised more than $76 million for Harris’ campaign. Obama, in some ways a mentor to Harris, will expand his involvement in campaign efforts in the coming days, according to adviser Eric Schultz, who said the former president plans to “do everything he can” to help Harris win. Even before joining the trail, Obama played a role in Harris’ campaign by offering campaigning advice (occasionally unsolicited), according to reporting by Reuters. Surprising Fact Harris and Obama met two decades ago, and Harris went on to support Obama’s 2008 campaign by knocking on doors and helping fundraise before the Iowa caucuses, the BBC reported. Obama later supported Harris during her campaign to be California’s attorney general in 2010 and her Senate bid in 2016. Send me a secure tip.

It was the first time the president has shown up in the briefing room. CNN took note of the dueling appearances as it happened. ‘We were actually about to go live to Vice President Kamala Harris who’s speaking right now in Detroit, Michigan,’ anchor Boris Sanchez said on air. ‘And apparently she’s talking about this port strike ending, she’s trying to appeal to union workers, and yet you have the President of the United States come out, clearly overshadowing her, answering significant questions,’ he continued. Sanchez questioned if it was a ‘communications mistake? Is the left hand not talking to the right hand in this situation?’ Political strategist Frank Luntz who was a guest on CNN responded that had the two sides been coordinating ‘this would not have happened.’ Harris was in Redford Township, Michigan on Friday afternoon where she spoke of the importance of organized labor and offered praise for first responders while speaking to a room of firefighters and union members. Her appearance standing next to a firetruck in the Redford Township Fire Department North Station comes as the firefighters union declined to endorse Harris or Trump in the 2024. The non-endorsement is seen as a blow to the vice president after the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), represents over 350,000 firefighters, emergency responders and other medical workers was the first union to endorse President Biden in 2020. ‘Yours is a profession that is more than a profession, it really is about a calling,’ Harris told the crowd after receiving a warm welcome. She noted that her brother-in-law is a retired firefighter in California. ‘I know what you guys do, and I know your character,’ Harris said. ‘I know your families. I know what it means for the whole community for you all to take on the lives that you have decided to live, and I am so thankful to you.’ She praised them for working ‘long shifts with unpredictable hours’ under ‘some of the most dangerous conditions.’ Harris said she’s grateful for the union that supports them and their rights to ‘all they deserve in terms of wages and benefits.’ She was introduced by the president of the Michigan Professional Firefighters Union. The IAFF is the latest major union to withhold an endorsement in the 2024 presidential race. Last month, the Teamsters union declined to endorse a presidential candidate, though multiple local chapters threw their support behind the Democratic nominee. During her appearance, Harris also addressed the International Longshoremen’s Association agreeing to suspend a strike that closed down major ports just weeks before the election. Harris this week signaled support for the union workers after the strike began Tuesday. On Friday, the vice president praised the agreement stating ‘they did good.’ ‘I say everywhere I go, look collective bargaining benefits everybody,’ Harris said. Later in her speech, Harris blasted Donald Trump as an ‘unserious – human,’ pausing before she said the word human as if she would like to have said something else as she went after him over health care and treatment of American workers.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris was set to make an appearance in the&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: CNN criticizes Biden for &#8216;dominating&#8217; attention as Kamala Harris appears on stage in crucial swing state first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/cnn-criticizes-biden-for-dominating-attention-as-kamala-harris-appears-on-stage-in-crucial-swing-state/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/04/20/90472061-13926161-President_Biden_giving_remarks_in_the_White_House_press_briefing-m-63_1728069989485.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:32:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":258523566,"title":"The Biden administration isn't extending a two-year program for migrants from 4 nations","text":"The Biden administration will not extend a two-year program that allows migrants from certain nations into the U.S. if they came by plane with sponsorship.

However, FEMA faces a multibillion-dollar deficit, even after  imposing new spending restrictions last month. The agency is forgoing some ongoing rebuilding projects related to disaster repair to be better financially equipped to face immediate needs related to natural disasters.Vance's Stance Against FEMAFormer President Donald Trump, Vance's running mate, has criticized FEMA for spending money to help undocumented migrants, claiming it's the reason that the agency doesn't have more money to help Hurricane Helene victims. When asked about the president's stance on FEMA funding, Vance echoed Trump's sentiments and said FEMA should prioritize Americans over migrants.\"First of all, the idea that FEMA is running out of money is something that the leadership of the Harris administration has said,\" Vance said at a campaign event in Lindale, Geogia, on Friday.\"Especially if there's another disaster, they've said they might have to go back to the well, and I think a lot of Americans are saying, 'well, how can we afford to give billions of dollars to illegal immigrants in this country, but we've got to go back to the well to provide disaster relief for our own citizens?' That's a disgrace.\"FEMA has denied that disaster relief money has been used to support international efforts or border-related issues in a government webpage addressing Hurricane Helene rumors.\"This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,\" the website said.However, Vance said the federal government was sending \"billions of dollars to illegal aliens.\"\"I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that our own government is sending billions of dollars to illegal aliens when there are hardworking Americans,\" he said. \"We've got to focus on them. Focus on our American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by these terrible storms, that's what Kamala Harris ought to be doing, and it's a damn shame that she's not doing her job.\"FEMA ScrutinyScrutiny about FEMA spending has increased in recent weeks after FEMA  spent money on assisting communities across the country dealing with an influx of migrants through its Shelter and Services Program (SSP). The program had a budget of $640 million for the 2024 Fiscal Year, which ended on September 30.Trump has criticized the SSP, which helps local governments and nonprofits support migrants. However, FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security have denied that any FEMA disaster relief funds have gone to the program.\"The Shelter and Services Program (SSP) is a completely separate, appropriated grant program that was authorized and funded by  Congress and is not associated in any way with FEMA's disaster-related authorities or funding streams,\" a DHS spokesperson previously told Newsweek.FEMA was separately given $20 billion for the disaster relief fund as part of the short-term spending bill passed at the end of September.However, claims are now surfacing that FEMA doesn't have enough money to assist those in need after Hurricane Helene caused catastrophic damage across several states, including North Carolina.FEMA Director of Public Affairs Jaclyn Rothenberg told Newsweek that FEMA has enough funding to support the Hurricane Helene response and any subsequent disasters through December 20.Why Didn't Vance Vote?Many Republicans voted against the continuing resolution, but Vance was not among them. He didn't attend the September 25 vote, instead attending a campaign rally in Michigan. The Washington Post reported last week that Vance has missed 38 votes over the past few months due to his busy campaigning schedule with Trump.Vance isn't the only politician to miss votes while campaigning for office.In 2020, Harris, a senator at the time and campaigning with President Joe Biden, didn't vote for the continuing resolution passed in September and included a similar funding structure for FEMA. She also didn't vote for a continuing appropriations act in November 2019, when she was running for the Democratic presidential nomination.Even if Vance had voted, his vote wouldn't have been a deciding factor in the continuing resolution.Several Congress members have since called for Congress to reconvene to reconsider aid regarding Hurricane Helene's impacts, including Republican Senator Rick Scott, who voted against the continuing resolution that included aid for FEMA. Vance has also spoken in favor of Congress reconvening to approve funding for hurricane relief, according to a report from Virginia news outlet Cardinal News.","summary":"JD Vance has echoed former President Donald Trump's sentiments about prioritizing money for Americans over migrants.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vance-fema-funding-hurricane-disgrace-1964231","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2488163/jd-vance-calls-out-amount-hurricane-funding.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:23:28","author":"Anna Skinner","authors":["Anna Skinner"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.581},{"id":258524736,"title":"Pamela Anderson, 57, looks incredible in baby pink midi dress as she picks up prestigious award at the 20th Zurich Film Festival","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Friday, Oct 4th 2024 1AM 7°C 4AM 7°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement It's a year since Hamas took away my beautiful girl... my heart is breaking a little more every day, says mother of the only British hostage still in Gaza as she pens moving letter that she hopes will reach her alive Burglar breaks into woman's home, hangs up her washing, puts away her shopping and empties bin - before leaving note telling her to 'be happy' Bezos's billion-dollar secret: Amazon founder reveals how a one-hour ritual led to his success BORIS JOHNSON: I fear for the Falklands now Starmer has been exposed as a spineless Leftie surrenderist fraud Why I ghosted best friend who helped me through toughest times of my life Woke exam chiefs ban 'problematic' words including 'immigration' and 'homosexuality' from papers... as they tell history teachers not to use 'medieval' RICHARD EDEN: Another loss for Emma Raducanu as Porsche take back freebie... three years after stunning US Open win 'I did nothing wrong': Sven-Goran Eriksson's defiant blast from beyond the grave on Ulrika Jonsson, Faria Alam and his red-hot love life in an exclusive extract from his memoir 'Amanda went too far': The very curious backstory to Abbington's extraordinary Newsnight interview.

On Thursday, Oct. 3, The E Street Band leader posted an Instagram Reel where he voiced his support for the Democratic candidate in a video recorded at a diner. \"Friends, fans, and the press have asked me who I'm supporting in the most important of elections,\" Springsteen, 75, said. \"And with full knowledge of my opinions [being] no more or less important than any of my fellow citizens, here's my answer: I'm supporting Kamala Harris for president and Tim Walz for vice president.\" The Boss called the upcoming election \"the most consequential\" and says the United States has not felt as \"politically, spiritually, and emotionally divided\" since the Civil War. \"At this moment, it doesn't have to be this way,\" he insisted. The \"Born to Run\" singer went onto call Donald Trump \"the most dangerous candidate for president in my lifetime.\" \"He doesn't understand the meaning of this country, its history, or what it means to be deeply American,\" Springsteen said, citing Trump's \"disdain\" for the \"sanctity\" of the Constitution, democracy and the peaceful transfer of power — the latter referring to Trump's refusal to accept Joe Biden's presidential win in 2020. He added that Harris and Walz are \"committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone, regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity.\" \"They want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all,\" Springsteen said. \"Not just for a few like me on top. That's the vision of America I've been consistently writing about for 55 years now.\" Springsteen joins Taylor Swift and Jennifer Lawrence as a high-profile Harris supporter. Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. He continued: \"Everybody sees things different, and I respect your choice as a fellow citizen. But like you, I've only got one vote and it's one of the most precious possessions I have.\" Springsteen has remained politically active throughout his career. He appeared at several of Barack Obama's rallies during his election campaigns and also showed support for Vice President Joe Biden — even appearing at his inauguration, per Rolling Stone. In October 2020 on his SiriusXM show, Bruce Springsteen: From My Home to Yours, the New Jersey rocker celebrated Halloween and the upcoming election with an episode titled \"Farewell to The Thief,\" where he recited an Elayne Griffin Baker poem that emphasized what he felt Trump lacked. \"There's no art in this White House. There's no literature, no poetry, no music. There are no pets in this White House, no loyal man's best friend, no Socks the family cat, no kids' science fairs,\" Baker wrote in the first verse.","summary":"The New Jersey icon called the upcoming 2024 election &#34;consequential&#34;","url":"https://people.com/bruce-springsteen-endorses-kamala-harris-2024-presidential-election-8723568","image":"https://people.com/thmb/yGwBVifxggblTf_ehDnf34_2FGc=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(653x193:655x195)/bruce-springsteen-053123-7ea2eba3d9c040b1a8bec662d3ea5980.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:20:23","author":"Jade Gomez","authors":["Jade Gomez"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.431},{"id":258528818,"title":"Leonardo DiCaprio, 49, cuddles up to girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, 26, in Rome where they are joined by his mother","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Saturday, Oct 5th 2024 1AM 7°C 4AM 7°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement 'Do they want to see me dead?': Tears of TV menopause Dr over BBC Panorama documentary that has left her reputation close to being in tatters Shock leaked tape reveals Donald Trump cracking a JOKE about widow of firefighter killed by rally assassin Bezos's billion-dollar secret: Amazon founder reveals how a one-hour ritual led to his success Why drawing British man paid less than £1,000 for could sell for £2MILLION BORIS JOHNSON: I fear for the Falklands now Starmer has been exposed as a spineless Leftie surrenderist fraud Why I ghosted best friend who helped me through toughest times of my life Burglar breaks into woman's home, hangs up her washing, puts away her shopping and empties bin - before leaving note telling her to 'be happy' Ulrika Jonsson, 57, reveals she used alcohol to 'remember the good times' and would often 'black out' after binge drinking alone as she celebrates being 121 days sober Mystery of missing Victoria: Distraught fiancé reveals the bride-to-be just wanted to give their daughter the childhood she never had as he sobs: 'I just hope she comes back' 'I did nothing wrong': Sven-Goran Eriksson's defiant blast from beyond the grave on Ulrika Jonsson, Faria Alam and his red-hot love life in an exclusive extract from his memoir 'Amanda went too far': The very curious backstory to Abbington's extraordinary Newsnight interview.

The 49-year-old Titanic star enjoyed a cup of coffee as he wrapped his arm around his 26-year-old flame, who originally hails from Italy. They were accompanied by Leo's mother Irmelin Indenbirken, who was seen emerging onto the balcony as Vittoria headed back indoors. He cut a boho chic figure in a white t-shirt, casual khaki trousers and a black Dodgers cap, bringing the outfit together with monochrome sneakers. Vittoria sweetly matched his look in a boyfriend fit white t-shirt and a set of sleek black jeans that matched her ballet flats.

While they were up on the balcony, Leo was spotted snapping pictures of Vittoria, and the pair were also seen wrapping their arms around each other. Leonardo and Vittoria were seen enjoying a sightseeing double date that day, strolling around the city with Irmelin and her husband David Ward. Vittoria and Leonardo were repeatedly spotted over the summer enjoying a glamorous yachting trip around the Mediterranean. During a stop-off in Sardinia, Vittoria was spotted sporting a ring on her engagement ring, unleashing an avalanche of rumors about the true state of their relationship.

A: The government must provide medical care to prisoners and immigrant detainees. Vice President Kamala Harris expressed support in a 2019 questionnaire for “medically necessary” gender-affirming care, including surgical care, for federal prisoners and detainees. She has not detailed her position in the current campaign. FULL QUESTIONS Does Kamala Harris support government paid transgender surgery for prison inmates and illegal immigrants? TV shows an ad in which Kamala Harris says all transgender inmates should have access to medical care. Did she really say this? Does that mean treatment and/or surgery ? FULL ANSWER Este artículo estará disponible en español en El Tiempo Latino. We’ve recently received a number of reader questions about Vice President Kamala Harris’ stance on providing gender-affirming surgeries for transgender prisoners and immigrants, often sparked by a campaign advertisement from her opponent, former President Donald Trump. A transgender person’s gender identity does not match their sex assigned at birth. The U.S. Constitution requires that the government provide needed medical care for prisoners, according to a 1976 Supreme Court ruling. Transgender inmates in federal and state prisons have argued in court that this includes providing medically necessary gender-affirming care. Some federal and state prisoners have received gender-affirming surgeries following legal victories. So far, this has included two federal prisoners in the custody of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, according to an email from an agency spokesperson. There are also government policies supporting necessary gender-affirming care for immigrant detainees, including hormone therapy, although we were unable to find any policy specifically recommending gender-affirming surgery or any records of such surgeries having occurred. When she was running to be the Democratic presidential nominee in 2019, Harris went on record in an American Civil Liberties Union candidate questionnaire as supporting medically necessary gender-affirming care for federal prisoners and immigrant detainees, including surgical care. She also expressed support for gender-affirming surgery for California state inmates on other occasions during her 2019 presidential run, taking some credit for working “behind the scenes” to get access to these surgeries for prisoners. However, Harris has not clarified her exact position on gender-affirming care for prisoners and detainees during her current campaign, and Trump and his campaign have sometimes left out information on when and in what context Harris spoke about these topics. Trump’s statements also lack context on the small number of gender-affirming surgeries that prisoners have received and the legal basis for providing such care. Attempts by a presidential administration to roll back access to gender-affirming care for prisoners would likely meet legal challenges. “It’s hard to believe, but it’s true. Even the liberal media was shocked Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens,” a narrator says in the Trump campaign advertisement. “Kamala’s for they/them. President Trump is for you.” The ad stitches together two different sections of a 2019 interview to show Harris saying: “Surgery for prisoners … every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access.” In that interview, Harris was specifically referring to her past efforts in California to secure access to gender-affirming surgery for inmates in state prison, although, as we’ve said, she did express support for access to medically necessary gender-affirming care for federal prisoners in her ACLU questionnaire response. The Trump campaign has spent more than $11 million to run the ad on broadcast television in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., according to AdImpact, an advertising tracking service, as well as around $361,000 to run it on digital platforms. Trump also alluded to Harris’ questionnaire response during the presidential debate on Sept. 10, a day after CNN published a story about her 2019 answers. “Now she wants to do transgender operations on illegal aliens that are in prison,” Trump said. “This is a radical left liberal that would do this.” He has since referenced the topic repeatedly. “Why does Kamala want to give transgender operations to convicted illegal migrants coming in and staying in detention cells?” Trump asked during a Sept. 27 campaign event in Walker, Michigan. “She said we will give them sex change operations. Now somebody would look at me and say that’s crazy. I’m sure that’s not true. No, no it’s 100% true. She wants to, wanted to, wants to give them.” “She even endorsed free sex changes … and this was recently, she endorsed free sex changes for illegal aliens in detention centers all over our country at taxpayer expense,” Trump said at a Sept. 23 rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania. In both of these two recent appearances, Trump also cited inflated costs for gender-affirming surgery, which we will discuss later. But as we said previously, Harris has not expressed her current views, and her comments on gender-affirming care for detainees are five years old. In the Sept. 9 CNN article that brought the ACLU questionnaire back into the news, a Harris campaign spokesperson declined to specify what her current position is on the issue. The next day, when responding to a question about the ACLU questionnaire on Fox News the morning of the debate, the Harris campaign’s communications director, Michael Tyler, said, “That questionnaire — this is not what she is proposing, it’s not what she’s running on.” The campaign did not provide further comment in response to our questions. Harris’ History on Gender-Affirming Surgery for Prisoners in California As a former California attorney general, Harris has been involved in legal cases on gender-affirming surgery for state prisoners. Her office represented the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation as it attempted to block gender-affirming surgery for a state inmate in 2015. The department ultimately came to an agreement to revise its policy on providing medically necessary gender-affirming surgery to prison inmates that same year, following a legal loss. In 2017, a transgender inmate in California became the first prisoner in the U.S. to be provided gender-affirming surgery. As of December 2022, 20 California inmates had received gender-affirming surgery, according to the nonprofit news organization CalMatters. Inmates in state prisons seeking gender-affirming surgeries have since succeeded in court cases in other states, leading to some gender-affirming surgeries. During a January 2019 news conference at the outset of Harris’ first presidential run, the Washington Blade asked Harris about her record of “seeking to deny surgery for trans inmates” in California. Harris responded that as attorney general, “there are unfortunately situations that occurred where my clients took positions that were contrary to my beliefs.” However, she took “full responsibility” for her office’s actions, before further indicating her support for gender-affirming care for inmates. “But on that issue I will tell you I vehemently disagree and in fact worked behind the scenes to ensure that the Department of Corrections would allow transitioning inmates to receive the medical attention that they required, they needed and deserved,” Harris said. Harris or her representatives during the 2019 campaign continued to reiterate her work “behind the scenes” on the eventual California policy to provide gender-affirming surgery to some inmates. This included an interview posted in October 2019 between Harris and Mara Kiesling, then executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality Action Fund. Snippets of the interview are quoted in the Trump advertisement that is currently airing. In the interview, Kiesling asked why transgender people should vote for Harris. As part of a much longer answer, Harris recalled learning that the California Department of Corrections was “standing in the way of surgery for prisoners.” After learning about the case, Harris said, “I worked behind the scenes to not only make sure that that transgender woman got the services she was deserving. So it wasn’t only about that case. I made sure that they changed the policy in the state of California so that every transgender inmate in the prison system would have access to the medical care that they desired and need.” Harris’ Record on Gender-Affirming Care for Federal Prisoners Although Trump’s advertisement takes Harris’ 2019 comments on transgender inmates out of context, she did give broader support for gender-affirming care for prisoners in response to the 2019 ACLU questionnaire. The ACLU questionnaire asked, “As President will you use your executive authority to ensure that transgender and nonbinary people who rely on the state for medical care — including those in prison and immigration detention — will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care? If yes, how will you do so?” Harris checked a box answering “Yes,” before elaborating: Harris, 2019 ACLU questionnaire: It is important that transgender individuals who rely on the state for care receive the treatment they need, which includes access to treatment associated with gender transition. That’s why, as Attorney General, I pushed the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide gender transition surgery to state inmates. I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained. Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment. At the time, no federal prisoner had received gender-affirming surgery. The first gender-affirming surgery was provided to a U.S. federal prisoner in 2022, after a federal court ruling stated that the government was required to provide this care. A second surgery took place in 2023. Actions taken during the Biden-Harris administration have indicated some support for necessary medical care for transgender inmates. The Department of Justice has provided statements of interest in cases in which state prisoners have sought gender-affirming care. These statements note that, among other legal bases, the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment requires adequate care for prisoners, including those with gender dysphoria. Gender dysphoria is a diagnosis that some but not all transgender people have, and refers to intense distress over the mismatch between a person’s sex assigned at birth and their gender identity. In 2022, the BOP brought back a Transgender Offender Manual for how to treat federal prisoners, following a Trump-era hiatus for the document. In response to questions about gender-affirming care, a BOP spokesperson sent us a link to this document. Among other policies, the document now addresses gender-affirming surgery. “For transgender inmates in Bureau custody, surgery may be the final stage in the transition process and is generally considered only after one year of clear conduct and compliance with mental health, medical, and programming services at the gender affirming facility,” the document reads, while acknowledging that not all transgender inmates even want these surgeries. Nor is asking for gender-affirming surgery a guarantee that a federal prisoner will get it. The manual simply says that the requests will be considered. The BOP spokesperson confirmed to us that two federal inmates have gotten these surgeries to date. There are 1,461 transgender female prisoners and 770 transgender male prisoners currently in the custody of BOP, according to the agency. Context on Gender-Affirming Care for Immigrant Detainees In his recent comments on free “sex change” surgeries, Trump has often focused on the idea that Harris wants to give these surgeries to immigrant detainees. However, as we’ve said, we weren’t able to find a record of immigrant detainees having gotten these surgeries. Immigrants who are detained while trying to enter the U.S. may be held by Customs and Border Patrol. These detainees should “generally not be held for longer than 72 hours in CBP hold rooms or holding facilities,” according to the agency. A report found that people were in custody for an average of 62 to 74 hours between October 2022 and June 2023, depending on the type of CBP facility. People may be in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody for longer, but stays are still supposed to be relatively short. The average length of stay for a person detained by ICE in 2024 so far is 47 days. As of Sept. 8, there have been 231 transgender detainees booked into ICE custody in 2024, and there are currently 47 transgender people in custody, according to ICE statistics, although groups that advocate for transgender people in detention have said the ICE statistics are probably an undercount. In a statement to FactCheck.org, an ICE spokesperson mentioned emergent care needs, a phrase typically used to refer to health care that is needed immediately to stave off significant harm. “The agency recognizes that detained transgender noncitizens have unique needs while in ICE custody,” the spokesperson said in an email. “In response to those needs, we have developed structures within our operation to safeguard their rights and ensure their emergent care needs are met from the moment they arrive and throughout the entirety of their stay.” Gender-affirming surgery is not usually a quick process. As we’ve said, there is a waiting period of one year before federal inmates can even seek gender-affirming surgery. Experts also told The 19th, a nonprofit news site that writes about gender issues, that a waiting period for gender-affirming surgery is common whether someone is in a prison or not. A 2015 ICE memorandum outlines policies for transgender detainees, including some recommendations on gender-affirming care, Dr. Elizabeth Kvach, a Colorado family physician with experience providing medical care to transgender individuals in immigration detention, told us. This includes recommendations that detainees be given access to “mental health care and other transgender-related health care and medication (such as hormone therapy) based on medical need.” Kvach said that in her experience in Colorado, transgender detainees are given access, if desired, to “evaluation for initiation and/or continuation of hormone therapy for affirmation of their gender identity while detained.” However, she was not aware of instances of care extending to gender-affirming surgery. “To the best of my knowledge, in the decade I have been doing this work in Colorado there have been no transgender detainees who have sought or received gender affirming surgeries while in immigration detention,” Kvach said, while acknowledging that she “cannot speak to practices in other detention facilities or states.” Elana Redfield, federal policy director at the Williams Institute at the UCLA School of Law, also shared a recent report indicating that some transgender and other detainees had trouble getting hormone therapy or other medical care, “let alone surgical treatments,” she said, although she noted that only a small number of people were interviewed. For the report, representatives of nonprofit organizations interviewed 41 LGBTQ+ and HIV-positive immigrants pursuing asylum and held by CBP and ICE, including 14 people identifying as transgender. Four transgender detainees reported trouble getting hormone therapy, while a transgender woman who had previously gotten breast implants told a story of receiving delayed and inadequate medical care after one of her implants burst while in ICE custody. “What we’re seeing there is an enormous unmet need for even basic health care,” Kellan Baker, a health services researcher with expertise in cost-related issues and transgender health, told us of the experience of immigrants in detention. Baker is executive director of Whitman-Walker Institute, a research and policy institute affiliated with a Washington, D.C., community health center. The institute’s mission is “advancing the health and wellbeing of LGBTQ+ people, people living with HIV, and other groups facing barriers to quality care.” “No one is taking advantage of being in a prison system or in immigration detention to try to get care that they don’t need,” he said. Trump Exaggerates Cost of Gender-Affirming Surgery In recent appearances, Trump has mentioned the cost of providing “sex change” surgery. But Baker said that his estimates are too high. “They’re in a detention cell and a man wants to transition into womanhood, and [Harris] is willing to do that and give very expensive operations, by the way, hundreds of thousands of dollars,” Trump said during his Sept. 27 appearance in Walker, Michigan. Trump was even more specific in his Sept. 23 Indiana, Pennsylvania, speech. “You’re being held in a detention center, and you say, ‘I want to change. I want to become a woman.’ And they have to give you the operation. Which is an immensely expensive operation on top of everything else — $250,000 at least, and then all the drugs involved and everything else,” Trump said. As we’ve said, we didn’t find reports of anyone getting gender-affirming surgery in CBP or ICE detention, although a limited number of these surgeries have been done in state and federal prisons. Baker said that there is “very little data” on prices paid for medical care within prison systems. But his own research on amounts paid by private insurers for these surgeries found that the average cost for vaginoplasty in the U.S. is around $50,000. Given that private insurance “tends to reimburse better” than a public program would, $50,000 “is probably significantly above what the cost of a similar procedure in the prison system would be,” Baker said. Baker also pointed out that there aren’t that many transgender people in prison to begin with and that not every person is going to need gender-affirming surgery. “Typically what folks need in incarceration settings are just basic supplies and supports, like the right kind of clothing … and medications – so hormone therapy, for example, as well as mental health support, if they need it,” he said. Further, especially compared with some other drugs a prisoner might need for medical care in general, he said, hormone therapy is “unbelievably cheap.” Editor’s note: FactCheck.org does not accept advertising.

Bob Casey refuses to say if Biden or Harris is better for Pa. in heated debate against Dave McCormick","text":"HARRISBURG, Pa. — Sen. Bob Casey raised eyebrows debating GOP challenger Dave McCormick Thursday night when the Scranton native refused to say which Democrat would be better for Pennsylvania — Vice President Kamala Harris or former candidate President Biden. Casey initially dodged ABC27 moderator Dennis Owens’ question, then visibly bit his lip before responding when pressed. “Oh, I don’t know, Dennis. We’ll never know the answer to that,” the Democrat said. “The voters are going to make a decision.” Of course, the decision of the nearly 14.5 million Americans who voted for Biden — another Scranton native — in this year’s Democratic primaries was thrown out the window. The Casey-McCormick face-off in Harrisburg was the first of three planned debates; they’ve agreed to meet again in Philadelphia Oct. 15 and Pittsburgh on an unspecified date. McCormick attempted to paint Casey as “weak” and “liberal” in their first matchup, tying the senator’s voting record to Biden and Harris while repeatedly touting his campaign’s opposition website about the incumbent, CaseyLies.com. “You should ask yourself: Why is a senator with an 18-year track record who should be able to run on his record running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?” McCormick said. Casey largely focused his attacks on McCormick’s past residence in Connecticut while CEO of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates. When Casey cited an August 2023 AP article alleging McCormick lied about his Pennsylvania residency, the businessman fired back fiercely. “The fact that he got some reporter at the Associated Press to validate his lies or reinforce his lies does not mean it’s true,” the Republican replied. McCormick moved back to Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood in 2022 to run for Senate but grew up in Bloomsburg. Both men accused each other of not standing up to their party’s more “extreme” factions, particularly on border security. McCormick — who has visited the US-Mexico border twice — slammed Casey for neglecting to go at all. “Senator, you speak a lot about the border. I suggest you go,” McCormick said. “I’ve been to the border more times than the senator and the border czar.” “I guess Mr. McCormick knows more about border security than the Border Patrol. I don’t think so,” Casey retorted. Casey also went after McCormick for not standing up to former President Donald Trump when he persuaded Senate Republicans to kill a bipartisan border bill. “Leadership would be taking on the leader of your own party and supporting the bill,” Casey said. McCormick was not serving in government when GOP senators killed the bill earlier this year. At an Americans for Prosperity Action watch party down the road, attendees praised McCormick’s performance. Bill Gramlich, a 60-year-old self-employed home-improvement contractor, has volunteered with AFP Action in Pennsylvania for the past eight years and canvassed on McCormick’s behalf this year. Gramlich told The Post this election feels different: McCormick, he said, is a “more viable candidate.” (The controversial Dr. Mehmet Oz lost to Democratic Sen. John Fetterman in 2022.) “He’s energized, and people are very enthusiastic about him running for this election against Bob Casey,” he said. “His credentials are really, really good, he’s a top-notch leader,” he added, citing the West Point graduate’s business accomplishments and service as a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne Division. AFP PA Senior Adviser Emily Greene said her team of more than 230 canvassers aims to knock on 1 million doors before Election Day — and has already hit more than 750,000 since April. She said that “no one is feeling prosperity under this current economy,” so they’re looking for change. “They want something different,” she said. “They want to actually find prosperity, and they’re not doing it through Sen. Bob Casey’s leadership.”","summary":"HARRISBURG, Pa. — Sen.

'Yesterday, my wife and I saw Coldplay perform live on QVC and our jaws are still on the floor. What’s happened to artistic integrity?' one X user asked. One passionate Coldplay fan came to their defense as they replied: 'Relax, it was a joke. Except for the new album, all the items were a joke. Because it's a silly concept to sell Coldplay on QVC, it was funny!' Still, numerous tweets described Coldplay selling their album live on QVC in America as 'utterly bizarre' and 'unserious.' QVC is a free-to-air television network, where hosts typically encourage viewers to buy apparel, accessories, and jewelry. Overall, viewers were left shocked when Coldplay appeared on QVC on Thursday. The world-famous band consists of Chris Martin, Jonny Buckland, Guy Berryman and Will Champion and they have sold more than 100 million records around the world.

'Because we're older now, we're moving into crockery and Tupperware. The music is really just serving our kitchen line now.' As part of their appearance on the teleshopping network, the singers took calls from viewers at home. Candy from Florida told the band how she had had to miss one of their concerts in 2008 because of the death of her father. In reply, Chris sang: 'I'm sorry we missed you back in 2008, but some things are better when you're forced to wait.' Host Jennifer Coffey claimed that more than 30,000 people were waiting to buy the band's album just 10 minutes after they arrived on air.

During an appearance on BBC Radio 2's Jo Whiley, he said: 'Our last proper record will come out in 2025 and after that I think we will only tour. 'Maybe we'll do some collaborative things but the Coldplay catalogue, as it were, finishes then.' Despite this, he then retracted that comment and claimed that the band will continue on for another two records. Chris recently mentioned that he believes that Moon Music is one of the band's strongest albums He told Zane Lowe on Apple Music: 'It's really important that we have that limit. There's only 12 and a half Beatles albums. There's about the same Bob Marley, so all of our heroes. 'And also having that limit means that the quality control is so high right now, and for a song to make it, it's almost impossible, which is great. And so where we could be kind of coasting, we're trying to improve. Chris believes Moon Music is one of the band's strongest albums. He previously noted: 'If you've ever liked Coldplay, your favourite Coldplay song's probably on this album,' he says. So, is there another Viva La Vida or Fix You? That's a high bar, and such things are usually only apparent once the songs have been done live, but I see two contenders.

This small fashion choice sparked curiosity and excitement among viewers. The colorful beaded bracelets were spotted when Walz gestured with his hands, and for many, they brought to mind pop star Taylor Swift, who showed her support for Vice President Kamala Harris only a few weeks before. Swifties often make and trade similar bracelets in a nod to her 2022 song You're on Your Own, Kid. Naturally, people wondered about the meaning behind Walz's bracelets after the debate. Walz explained their origin on social media the next day. He wrote, \"Nothing is more important in my life than being a dad. Grateful to Hope for the lucky charm before the debate last night.\" Hope is Walz's daughter, who gave him the bracelets as a good luck gift. The Harris-Walz campaign later shared more details with People, revealing that one bracelet said 'Joyful Warrior' and the other said 'Coach.' Both phrases have special meaning for Walz's campaign. 'Joyful Warrior' comes from Doug Emhoff, Harris' husband, who started using it to describe Harris and Walz after some criticized their upbeat campaign style. 'Coach' refers to Walz's past as a high school football coach when led his team to their first state championship. The bracelets definitely fit well with Swift's recent endorsement on September 10. She wrote, \"I'm voting for @kamalaharris because she fights for the rights and causes I believe need a warrior to champion them.\" She praised Walz and said he 'has been standing up for LGBTQ+ rights, IVF, and a woman's right to her own body for decades.' Walz also acknowledged Swift's support in his closing statement: \"I'm as surprised as anybody of this coalition that Kamala Harris has built. From Bernie Sanders to Dick Cheney to Taylor Swift, and a whole bunch of folks in between there.\" Interestingly, the Harris-Walz campaign quickly made their own friendship bracelets to sell after Swift's endorsement earlier in September. These $20 bracelets had the candidates' names spelled out in beads. They sold out quickly, which showed just how popular the idea was. But it's also worth noting that the friendship bracelets weren't Walz's only accessories. He also wore a watch, a dark suit, a blue tie, and an American flag pin. His opponent, Ohio Senator JD Vance, wore a navy suit with a bright pink tie. Walz's bracelets caught the attention of Swift fans online. People on social media also expressed their glee over the bracelets. One X (formerly Twitter) user wrote, \"WALZ IS WEARING FRIENDSHIP BRACELETS AWEEE. He's the best.\" Another said, \"OMG, it's friendship bracelet time?!?! YES.\" Besides, the bracelets show a personal side of Walz, and this one small detail made a big impression during an important political event.","summary":"Walz wore a dark suit, a blue tie, and an American flag pin, whereas his opponent, Ohio Senator JD Vance, wore a navy suit with a bright pink tie.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/tim-walz-wore-one-unexpected-accessory-at-the-vp-debate-that-left-everyone-buzzing-with-excitement","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/718635/uploads/dfaf58b0-822b-11ef-bd5d-fb45b196909b_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:15:01","author":"INQUISITR,Shraddha","authors":["INQUISITR","Shraddha"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.462},{"id":258522688,"title":"“Obamacare Controversy Resurfaces on the Campaign Trail: Analysis from the Politics Desk”","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill. In today’s edition, senior national political reporter Sahil Kapur examines how the political fight over Obamacare was reignited this week. Plus, “Meet the Press” moderator Kristen Welker breaks down why Pennsylvania is shaping up to be so critical to the battle for the White House and the Senate. Sign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here. The Obamacare wars return to the campaign trail By Sahil Kapur Obamacare has re-entered the chat. Nearly 15 years after then-President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, the political fight over the health care overhaul is flaring up again in the final stretch of the 2024 presidential race. Vice President Kamala Harris has begun to lean in heavily on the issue, launching multiple ads this week vowing to protect the law, weaponizing former President Donald Trump’s ongoing calls to replace the ACA by arguing that he’d rip away subsidies to afford coverage and undo insurance regulations that protect pre-existing conditions. Trump won the 2016 election while campaigning on repealing Obamacare — which had long been used as a punching bag on the right — but the law gained popularity among the public after he tried to repeal it. Nevertheless, he has continued to criticize the law and says he still wants to replace it, but only if he devises a better program. He said in the Sept. 10 debate with Harris that he has “concepts of a plan,” but his campaign isn’t saying when he will release that proposal. Harris’ latest ad features a farmer with a brain tumor crediting Obamacare for saving her life and her farm. “Trump is coming for our health care. That’s pretty damn scary,” the woman says to the camera. Also this week, Trump’s running mate, Sen. JD Vance, raised eyebrows by rewriting the history of Trump’s attempts to repeal Obamacare when he was president. “Donald Trump could’ve destroyed the program. Instead he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care,” Vance said in Tuesday’s VP debate. Vance was wrong. As president, Trump fought to destroy the ACA through repeal legislation (which failed) that was projected to result in millions losing their coverage, through executive actions to weaken its insurance regulations and by asking the Supreme Court to wipe out the law entirely in 2020. Obamacare survived despite Trump’s efforts. Now, Harris wants to capitalize on the issue, as Democrats were able to do in the 2018 and 2020 elections. On Capitol Hill, many Republicans have sought to turn the page, seeing the Obamacare fight as a losing issue. But others are prepared to reopen it next year if they win the election. That includes Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who is running to be the new No. 3 Senate GOP leader. Cotton told NBC News that he supports including a health care overhaul in major tax legislation that Congress is poised to consider next year, with much of the Trump tax cuts expiring at the end of 2025. Also expiring at the end of 2025: enhanced subsidies for Obamacare that limit premiums for many Americans to 8.5% of income, costing about $25 billion per year. Extending those subsidies is a priority for Harris and Democrats. The winners of the 2024 election will decide whether it happens. Strategy shift: In addition to the newly launched health care-focused ads, Monica Alba, Jonathan Allen, Peter Nicholas and Yamiche Alcindor report that Harris’ campaign is planning to more aggressively attack Trump in the remaining weeks of the race as part of an attempt to win over the small number of remaining undecided voters, according to five Harris campaign officials. Meanwhile, some Democratic strategists and activists are expressing concern that by largely eschewing town hall-style events with voters and media interviews, Harris has failed to fully capitalize on the excitement surrounding her initial entry into the race, Peter Nicholas, Natasha Korecki, Monica Alba and Matt Dixon report. How the Keystone State remains key to 2024 By Kristen Welker With a month to go until Election Day, there is no state — right now — that’s more important than Pennsylvania. It’s key to both Kamala Harris’ and Donald Trump’s paths to 270 electoral votes, and public polls suggest the race in Pennsylvania is incredibly close. Trump, in fact, is set to campaign Saturday in Butler, Pa., the site of the attempt on his life nearly three months ago. Meanwhile, Barack Obama will make his first appearance on the campaign trail this fall next week in Pittsburgh at an event for Harris. What’s more, the Keystone State is home to an important Senate contest between Democratic incumbent Bob Casey and GOP challenger Dave McCormick. The two debated Thursday night for the first time, with Casey criticizing McCormick’s past residency in Connecticut, and with McCormick hitting Casey for standing behind President Joe Biden before he exited the 2024 race. For his part, Biden is scheduled to travel to Philadelphia next Tuesday for a Casey campaign event. And Pennsylvania features as many as five competitive House contests that could determine which party controls the chamber next year. A month from now, it’s possible another state dominates the political discussion on Election Night. After all, Wisconsin was the tipping-point state in 2016 and 2020 that pushed the winning presidential candidate across the Electoral College threshold. But for 2024, my money is on Pennsylvania being that must-watch state on Nov. 5 — and possibly beyond. That’s all from the Politics Desk for now.

That is unacceptable, and the next American president must change this dynamic. In one framing, the past 12 months have witnessed a remarkable display of America’s might and resolve in the Middle East—especially relative to our principal adversary in the region, Iran. Since October of last year, Israel has severely degraded Iran’s two most important affiliates in the area, Hezbollah and Hamas. Iran has lashed out directly only twice, with one ballistic-missile assault in April and another this month—both largely neutralized by U.S., Israeli, and allied air and missile defenses. The United States, in contrast with Iran, has backed its principal affiliate in the region, Israel, to the fullest extent. It has shipped billions of dollars of military equipment and munitions to Israel over the past 12 months, on top of the roughly $3.8 billion it already provides annually; shared sensitive intelligence to allow Israel to target Hamas’s senior leaders and recover its hostages; and repeatedly deployed its own troops to defend Israel from assault. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s assertions that Israel stands alone are at once laughable and insulting. Yet few people in the Middle East, or at home, would view the United States as particularly strong at the moment in the region. The reason is that the Biden administration has made abundantly clear over the past year that it has chosen not to dictate the terms of its own Middle East policy. It has repeatedly allowed Netanyahu and the rest of Israel’s leadership to do so instead. In April, Israel conducted an air strike in Damascus on a facility adjacent to the Iranian embassy. The United States received no warning about the strike; Biden and his advisers were caught unaware. The strike killed seven Iranian officers. Then Iran and its affiliates in the region launched a barrage of missiles at Israel. But the United States and several of its partners—most notably Jordan, France, the United Kingdom—helped blunt the attack with a coordinated display of air and missile defenses. With that, a Rubicon had been quietly crossed. Israel had always boasted that a generous supply of U.S. arms allowed Israel to fight its own fights, and that no American soldier had ever been asked to fight Israel’s battles for it. But America has tens of thousands of troops semipermanently garrisoned in the region, in part to respond to contingencies involving Israel, and by interceding to thwart the missile attack, American troops were fighting directly on Israel’s behalf. The situation in April repeated itself this past week, when Israel dramatically escalated its military offensive in Lebanon. No one should mourn the late Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah. But Israeli aerial and ground assaults have displaced more than 1 million Lebanese, and America was once again forced to commit its troops, including two Navy destroyers in the eastern Mediterranean, to repelling an Iranian ballistic-missile attack. This is now a pattern: Israel escalates the conflict, Biden and his team do nothing to stop it, and America follows Israel into war. Reasonable people can and will argue that the killing of Nasrallah and the destruction of Hezbollah are in America’s interest. But America’s leaders should be the ones making the decisions here, not Israel’s. Instead, and at each step of the conflict over the past 12 months, Biden and his advisers have ceded questions of strategy to Israel, in part by giving Israeli decision makers the benefit of the doubt at every major juncture. Previously established boundaries, such as the demand that Israel not march into Rafah this past summer, have been ignored as soon as Israel crosses them. Neither the Trump administration nor the Obama administration behaved this way. As different as they were, each administration owned its Middle East policy and dictated policy to Israel, not vice versa. The Trump administration killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani (which surely delighted Israel) and also unilaterally announced a withdrawal from Syria (which surely did not delight Israel). The Obama administration, meanwhile, negotiated the nuclear deal with Iran over strenuous Israeli objections, because it assessed the deal to be in U.S. interest. This is the way things are supposed to happen. A superpower does what it understands to be in its interest, and its partners in the region adjust. The Biden administration, by contrast, is acting like a dog that has decided that its own tail should wag it. Franklin Foer’s account of the Biden administration during this crisis makes for maddening and essential reading. Biden and his advisers are consistently confused as to why a strategy regarding Israel made up of all carrots and no sticks isn’t affecting Israeli decision making. The president is surprised and upset by an Israeli prime minister who is ungrateful for American support and consistently does what is in his own interest without regard for his patron in Washington, D.C. Biden, alone among major Democratic politicians, has a strong and warm relationship with Netanyahu. He seems to think that this rapport, along with the U.S. president’s powers of political persuasion, will somehow trump Netanyahu’s well-established and well-documented pathologies, which have frustrated American policy makers since James A. Baker. President Clinton famously asked, after meeting Netanyahu in 1996, “Who is the fucking superpower here?” Netanyahu doesn’t care about his friendship with Biden, or even about Israel’s dependence on the United States. He cares only about his near-term political interests. Everyone but Biden can see this. Many Arab American voters are fed up, and understandably so. Some of them see Donald Trump as a stronger leader than Biden because, let’s be honest, when it comes to the Middle East, he appears to be a stronger leader, or at least more assertive about U.S. interests. And the average voter can reasonably doubt that Biden’s vice president will be much different from him as president. This war could thus cost the Democrats a Senate seat in Michigan, which has a large Arab population, as well as the presidency itself given how narrow Kamala Harris’s lead in the state remains. Just yesterday, an American citizen from Michigan was killed in Lebanon. Yet when Palestinian Americans in Gaza or Lebanese Americans in Lebanon are killed, the response from their president is little more than a shrug, as if to say, What else can we do? That was, in fact, the conclusion that Biden’s team reached last month, according to Foer’s reporting: Over the course of two hours, the group batted ideas back and forth. In the end, they threw up their hands. There was no magical act of diplomacy, no brilliant flourish of creative statecraft that they could suddenly deploy. With this president, they may be right. Biden has made clear that his Middle East policy will be decided in Jerusalem, not Washington. But Israel is not going to stop. As Thomas L. Friedman once observed, Israel’s mentality has always been: If I am weak, how can I compromise? Yet if I am strong, why should I compromise? An American president has to be the one to say “enough.” But it will probably not be this American president.","summary":"Washington should be dictating policy to Jerusalem, not the other way around.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2024/10/israel-war-biden-iran/680155/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/c9M_GNSM9gX17ALdPuTy3vSV3_s=/0x57:2696x1461/1200x625/media/img/mt/2024/10/GettyImages_2162796079-1/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:05:34","author":"Andrew Exum","authors":["Andrew Exum"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.196},{"id":258522190,"title":"Democratic VP nominee Tim Walz to visit Los Angeles as part of fundraising blitz","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will be in Southern California starting Sunday as part of a three-day fundraising blitz through California and Washington, according to the Harris-Walz campaign. Walz, who is Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’ running mate, is scheduled to arrive in Los Angeles Sunday night, after speaking at an afternoon campaign reception in San Diego on behalf of the Harris Victory Fund, followed by another campaign reception in Montecito in Santa Barbara County that evening. The Harris-Walz campaign has yet to provide details about Walz’s visit to Los Angeles, though his schedule shows him arriving in L.A. around 8:45 p.m. Sunday, then landing at King County International Airport in Seattle, Monday night. Walz is scheduled to speak at a campaign reception in Seattle on Tuesday morning before flying back to California to deliver remarks at a reception in Sacramento on Tuesday afternoon. Walz’s visit to the West Coast comes days after he took part in the first and only vice presidential debate against Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who is former President Donald Trump’s running mate. In recent weeks, candidates for both campaigns have spent time in Southern California, a cash cow for politicians. Since February, there have been more than a dozen campaign fundraisers in L.A. and Orange counties headlined by some of the biggest names in presidential politics, including President Joe Biden, first lady Jill Biden and second gentleman Doug Emhoff – in addition to visits by Trump, Harris, Vance and Walz.","summary":"Walz is to arrive in L.A.

This meeting is part of a broader effort to reconnect with Muslim and Arab voters who previously backed Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election but may now withhold their votes from Harris.Harris is expected to engage with representatives from Emgage, the American Task Force on Lebanon, and Hala Hijazi, a long-time friend who has suffered personal losses in Gaza, as reported by Reuters news agency. Sources familiar with the plans, who requested anonymity, indicated that leaders from the Uncommitted National Movement protest campaign were not invited to the meeting, while Jim Zogby, founder of the Arab American Institute, declined the invitation.On Wednesday, Harris' national security adviser, Phil Gordon, held a virtual meeting with community leaders to reaffirm the administration's commitment to a ceasefire in Gaza, diplomatic efforts in Lebanon, and stability in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Additionally, during a Zoom call with Muslim voters, Minnesota governor Tim Walz, Harris’ vice-presidential pick, assured that Muslims would play an equal role in a Harris administration.Some Arab Americans express concern that Kamala's alignment with President Biden's Middle East policies could negatively impact her support. Ali Dagher, a Lebanese American attorney, said, “Harris is going to lose Michigan. I will not be voting for Kamala Harris. No one I know will vote for her.”Polls suggest that Harris and Trump hold nearly equal levels of support among Arab Americans. Harris has been focusing on labour issues, recently celebrating a union deal in Redford Township, Michigan, and planning to vow support for the state's auto industry alongside United Auto Workers Union President Shawn Fain.Harris, a Democrat, is gearing up for a challenging presidential race against Republican former President Donald Trump on November 5.","summary":"US vice president Kamala Harris is scheduled to meet with Arab American and Muslim leaders in Flint, Michigan, in a bid to regain voter support amidst disappointment over US backing of Israel's actions in Gaza and Lebanon ahead of the 2024 presidential race.","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-one-will-vote-for-her-kamala-harris-faces-challenges-in-gaining-back-arab-american-and-muslim-support/articleshow/113950582.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-113950640/113950640.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-04 22:05:21","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.114}]}
