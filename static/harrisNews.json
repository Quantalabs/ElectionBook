Local police arrested a suspect after the incident, and there were no reported injuries. The Vances were not there at the time of the incident.\n\n“I appreciate everyone's well wishes about the attack at our home. As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows. I'm grateful to the secret service and the Cincinnati police for responding quickly,” Vance said in a statement on X. “We weren't even home as we had returned already to DC.”\n\nThe U.S. Secret Service confirmed the incident in a statement to ABC News, saying, “An adult male was taken into custody by the Cincinnati Police Department after being detained by U.S. Secret Service personnel for causing property damage, including breaking windows on the exterior of a personal residence associated with the Vice President.”\n\nThe suspect was later identified as 24-year-old William DeFoor. And in a twist that should surprise no one, he is a male who “identifies” as a woman, with wealthy doctor parents who are also Democrat donors.\n\nA Facebook page created just last month suggests the suspect had already begun reshaping his public identity before the alleged home invasion. On the page, he calls himself Julia DeFoor, with the first profile photo appearing on December 15. Other than that, the details are limited.\n\nBREAKING: JD Vance home attacker William DeFoor confirmed to be transgender and goes by the name “Julia”Both parents are registered as Democrats, donating over $11,000 to Kamala Harris in 2024.They also donated to Joe Biden.There it is. pic.twitter.com/DSZjzgJvsy— Benny Johnson (@bennyjohnson) January 5, 2026\n\nBeyond that rebranding effort, the account reads like a record of drifting commitments. DeFoor claims to have graduated from Summit Country Day in 2018 before enrolling at the University of Cincinnati’s College-Conservatory of Music that fall. By 2020, he had left the program, and the profile lists no degree.\n\nThe profile highlights DeFoor's graduation from Summit Country Day in 2018 and attendance at the University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music beginning in August that year.According to the profile, DeFoor left the music conservatory in 2020, suggesting that a degree was never completed. His 19-year-old brother Alex, an aspiring musician who shares his songs on social media, currently studies at that very conservatory.DeFoor then enrolled at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College last year. It is unclear what he was studying.The Facebook profile also highlighted his liked pages, including the Heartland Trans Wellness center, which aims to provide resources for transgender patients in the Greater Cincinnati area.\n\nFederal Election Commission records reviewed by the Daily Mail show that his father, William, has been a reliable donor to Democratic causes. In the lead-up to the 2024 election, William contributed more than $11,600 to Kamala Harris’s campaign and to the Democratic Party fundraising platform ActBlue. He also donated to Joe Biden’s 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nICYMI: Democrats Demanded Maduro’s Ouster… Before Trump Delivered. And We Got the Receipts!\n\nDeFoor himself is a registered voter in Ohio. His party affiliation is not publicly listed, and voting records indicate he last cast a ballot in the 2020 election.\n\nThis is literally the most non-shocking thing about this vandalism story.

(EPA Images pic)\nWASHINGTON: Former US vice-presidential candidate Tim Walz announced Monday he was ending his bid for a third term as Minnesota governor, bowing out amid mounting political headwinds and renewed scrutiny over fraud in state programs.\nWalz, a Democrat who rose to national prominence as Kamala Harris's running mate in 2024, made the call just months after launching his reelection campaign.\nIn a statement, Walz said the storm over fraud allegations - and the partisan fights they have fueled - made it impossible to campaign effectively while governing.\n\"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can't spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,\" he said.\n\"So I've decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.\"\nThe governor has faced intensified Republican attacks tied to probes into a scandal around the misuse of pandemic-era aid programs, including a sprawling federal case involving the nonprofit Feeding Our Future.\nAs of late December, 92 people were charged in connection with the scandal, out of which 62 have been convicted.\nMany defendants in those ongoing cases are of Somali descent - a detail that President Donald Trump seized upon to launch verbal attacks against Minnesota's Somali community.\nTrump accused Walz of being \"corrupt\" and alleged baselessly that he had stolen billions of dollars of public funds, in a Truth Social post on Monday that grossly mischaracterized the facts of the case.\n\"I feel certain the facts will come out, and they will reveal a seriously unscrupulous, and rich, group of 'SLIMEBALLS,'\" he said.\nState officials say many claims have been exaggerated or debunked, but the controversy has weighed on Walz's approval ratings and rattled Democrats heading into the 2026 midterm elections.\nMinnesota has not elected a Republican to statewide office since 2006, and party leaders remain bullish about holding the governorship.\nStill, Walz's vulnerabilities had drawn a growing field of potential Republican challengers and prompted quiet calls among Democrats for a reset.\nHis exit clears the way for a crowded Democratic contest. US Senator Amy Klobuchar is widely viewed as a possible contender, alongside state Attorney General Keith Ellison and Minnesota's Secretary of State Steve Simon, though none has formally declared.\nFor Walz, a former teacher, National Guard veteran and union ally, the decision caps a meteoric rise from state politics to the national stage - and leaves Minnesota Democrats to chart their next chapter without one of their most recognizable figures.","summary":"The Democrat said a storm over fraud allegations made it impossible to campaign effectively while governing.","url":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/world/2026/01/06/ex-us-vp-nominee-tim-walz-ends-minnesota-reelection-run","image":"https://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/cdn-cgi/image/quality=75,format=auto,fit=scale-down,dpr=1,width=1600,height=1000/https://media.freemalaysiatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/13623107-Tim-Walz.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 22:47:28","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"my","sentiment":-0.08},{"id":391519716,"title":"Tim Walz jumps ship — and leaves fraud-scarred Minnesota Dems in big trouble","text":"Tim Walz is going away, but the Democratic Party’s Tim Walz crisis isn’t. \n\nThe Minnesota governor gave up his quest for a third term Monday: Staying out of jail will be challenging enough for him over the next few months, never mind prolonging his stay in office.\n\nFederal prosecutors estimate the Somali daycare scam and other frauds perpetrated under his watch cost taxpayers up to $9 billion.\n\nA constituency with that kind of money can be a big “help” to a state politician — or a national one, for that matter.\n\nOver the years Walz and his party have received plenty of campaign cash from the Somali community, a loyal — and influential — bloc in Minnesota Democratic politics.\n\nThe fraud was no well-kept secret; an independent journalist, Nick Shirley, easily exposed it.\n\nBut whistleblowers who’d tried to raise the alarm earlier were ignored and even allegedly harassed — it wasn’t convenient for Walz and friends to notice what a key constituency was up to.\n\nJust 14 months ago Walz was Kamala Harris’ running mate; he could have been a heartbeat away from the White House.\n\nHe was meant to be the answer to the national Democratic Party’s branding problems — countering its reputation for cultural weirdness and its difficulty courting white, male and rural voters.\n\nWalz was supposed to be a reassuringly “normal” Democrat, but it turns out what passes for normal in the party today is deep incompetence, corruption and worse.\n\nHe is indeed a symbol of his party, in all the worst ways.\n\nMinnesota was the upper Midwest’s only holdout in the Trump wave of 2024, the last blue redoubt in a region painted red by Trump’s populist rebranding of the Republican Party.\n\nDoes Walz’s disgrace put the state in play for 2028? \n\nThat would be catastrophic for the Democrats’ electoral map, throwing another 10 electoral votes to the GOP. \n\nThe last time the state voted for a Republican president was more than 50 years ago, when it backed Richard Nixon in 1972. \n\nIt’s been 20 years since a Republican won any statewide election in Minnesota: Tim Pawlenty, re-elected governor in 2006, was the last to do so.\n\nBut Walz and his scandals may have given Republicans two fresh chances this year and next. \n\nEven with Walz out of the way, his scandals will taint whoever gets the Democratic nomination for governor. \n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar wants the nod — but if she gets it and then wins in November, her vacated Senate seat will present another opportunity for the GOP in a special election next year.\n\nMinnesota’s other senator, Tina Smith, has already opted not to run for re-election this cycle, and her seat’s up in November.\n\nThat leaves Walz’s Democrats — technically the “Democratic-Farmer-Labor” party in Minnesota — facing a tough series of tests at the ballot box in the next few months, with the jaw-dropping scale of the Somali scandal threatening to overshadow everything.\n\nAnd ironically, even Somali-American voters in Minnesota have started souring on the Democrats: The Harris-Walz ticket actually lost ground with voters of Somali descent in 2024.\n\n“In the Somali American hub of Cedar-Riverside, support for Harris dropped 14 percentage points” compared to Joe Biden’s 2020 tally, according to a post-election report in the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\n“Votes for Harris also dropped in precincts in the Seward neighborhood and along West Lake Street by 9 and 12 percentage points,” the newspaper noted.\n\nBiden-Harris policies toward Israel and Gaza were one consideration; another was that Somali Muslims aren’t entirely comfortable with the modern Democratic Party’s progressive social stances.\n\nThe Harris-Walz ticket still wound up garnering the support of about 80% of the Somali community, however. \n\nIf the Democrats’ grip on Minnesota is slipping, it’ll be more traditional constituencies who bring about the break — perhaps those who question how well the “farmer” and “labor” legs of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor coalition have been served by a Democratic Party defined nowadays by its manias for mass immigration and extreme identity politics.\n\nWalz never was a middle-American Democrat, though.\n\nHe was just a bland-looking white guy whose politics were as far-out as those of anyone else in his party.\n\nAnother Walz won’t win Democrats white, male or rural voters, even if he’s scandal-free.\n\nThe Democrats’ problem isn’t with the way their candidates look or sound — it’s what they believe and do. \n\nAnd there won’t be a Democrat who can match the appeal of Republican populism until there’s one who dares take the populist side on immigration and cultural norms.\n\nThat kind of Democrat, if he or she exists at all today, would be the opposite of Tim Walz.\n\nDaniel McCarthy is the editor of Modern Age: A Conservative Review.","summary":"Walz’s departure has his party facing a tough series of tests at the ballot box, with the jaw-dropping scale of the Somali scandal threatening to overshadow everything.","url":"https://nypost.com/2026/01/05/opinion/tim-walz-jumps-ship-and-leaves-fraud-scarred-minnesota-dems-in-big-trouble/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-holds-118333807-e1767651212895.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 22:38:24","author":"Daniel McCarthy","authors":["Daniel McCarthy"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":391519730,"title":"Dems against Trump’s Maduro capture: Letters to the Editor — Jan. 6, 2026","text":"The Issue: Democrats criticizing the United States’ capture of Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro.\n\nThose saying President Trump capturing Nicolás Maduro was unconstitutional are either being disingenuous or don’t know what is in the Constitution, nor do they understand the Monroe Doctrine and other historical precedents giving the president authority to do exactly what Trump did (“Don disses doubters,” Jan. 4).\n\nThe people who were chanting “no kings” are now defending a ruthless dictator who’s killed thousands of Americans by sending drugs into our country.\n\nDemocrats don’t like anything Trump does, no matter if it’s in our best interest or not.\n\nCharles Sitero\n\nOrmond Beach, Fla.\n\nMany Democrats are vehemently criticizing Maduro’s capture, a move authorized by Trump.\n\nI have this hypothetical question: If Trump were president during the early 1940s and authorized and carried out a successful capture of Adolf Hitler, would the Democrats have been opposed to that as well?\n\nJonathan Dzik\n\nAny person with common sense who’s not afflicted with Trump Derangement Syndrome will agree with removing the notorious narco-criminal from Venezuela and bringing him to America to answer in a court of law for his deliberate dumping of illegal drugs that harmed many young people in our country.\n\nProof of the president’s wise decision can be seen in the joyful reaction among the citizens of Venezuela now that Maduro has been removed from what was illicit power.\n\nFrank Olivieri\n\nNorth Ft.

You know what I mean? He got out. \n\n“Like, you’re on the Jets, you go to the Steelers after 20 years and then you go, ‘Hey, I want to send in some plays on the Jets.’ They’re like, ‘Not anymore. No, you’re over there,’” the comedian posited. \n\n“I think he’ll probably lower his footprint and lower the temperature because he just wants to be, he wants to raise his family now,” Carvey added. \n\nSpade also expressed surprise that Clooney set his sights on France at all: “I would think if he’s bailing, he would go to Italy because he was in Italy for the last 20 years.”\n\nClooney has been among the most vocal A-list Hollywood figures to speak out against President Donald Trump and additionally set in motion widespread concerns over President Joe Biden’s cognitive abilities after writing a now-infamous New York Times op-ed. \n\nClooney and the president traded barbs as recently as last week after Trump on Wednesday evening praised Clooney’s decision to get French citizenship as “Good News!” before attacking him for his support of Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election. \n\n“Good News! George and Amal Clooney, two of the worst political prognosticators of all time, have officially become citizens of France which is, sadly, in the midst of a major crime problem because of their absolutely horrendous handling of immigration, much like we had under Sleepy Joe Biden,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Remember when Clooney, after the now infamous debate, dumped Joe during a fundraiser, only to go onto the side of another stellar candidate, Jamala(K!), who is now fighting it out with the worst governor in the Country, including Tim Waltz [sic], Gavin Newscum, for who is going to lead the Democrats to their future defeat.”\n\n“Clooney got more publicity for politics than he did for his very few, and totally mediocre, movies,” Trump continued. “He wasn’t a movie star at all, he was just an average guy who complained, constantly, about common sense in politics. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nIn a statement responding to Trump’s post, Clooney said: “I totally agree with the current president. We have to make America great again.

After all, for months already, we have watched as the narrative has been that drug boats being targeted are “only” moving cocaine into the U.S., not fentanyl. \n\nSo, in the environment of Democrats siding with drug cartels, and members of Congress encouraging our military members to disregard official orders, there was exactly zero surprise to hear the same mewling voices come out against the action taken in Venezuela. What has been revealing is exactly who is doing the complaining. Namely, in the helpless desire of many to take the downside on any 80/20 issue involving President Trump, this time they were acting in opposition to themselves.\n\nWe will start with the impacted minds at The Lincoln Project. Yes, we are well aware they are hardly considered the most sober of thinkers, but they do typify much of the thinking on the Left, and in this case, set the hypocritical stage for this discussion. If Trump does anything, the TLP braintrust will react accordingly – even if it means defying their own past positions. And as expected, with ringleader Rick Wilson, as they say, “There is always a tweet.”\n\nThen, with a sense of buildup, we turn to former Biden administration official Pete Buttigieg. Not to suggest he was ever a voice worth listening to with any degree of seriousness, but he is emblematic of what has been heard from his party the past few days. What is remarkable to witness is how these strident voices of opposition can arrive without a dose of reflection taking place. How does one take a firm stance on an issue and have abject amnesia on where they stood and have spoken about previously?\n\nNext, to take things to a more current position, we turn to Congress, where we have Senator Chris Murphy (D-CT) caterwauling consistently about the forced acquisition of the Venezuelan leader. However, his earnest-sounding words on the arrest are again belied by his previous earnest-sounding words on the matter. His about-face on the case of restoring democracy to that country was so obvious that even reliable Democratic Party sycophant Dana Bash had to dredge up his past words and have him try to explain his change of — well, we’ll say “heart,” despite a lack of evidence.\n\nContinuing our climb up the ladder of importance, we next have Murphy’s boss, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who also could not refrain from shuffling in front of the cameras to voice his displeasure that President Trump…had enforced the very action that Schumer had called for. \n\nREAD MORE: Whoops: Schumer's 'Open Mouth, Insert Foot' Moment as Dems' Hypocrisy Hits Hyper Drive on Venezuela\n\nThat Schumer is out there spilling the contents of classified intelligence conversations is but the start. (How DARE they not share details of a secret mission with the codger who is willing to belch out sensitive intel?!) He is bawling about the dangerous mission that was just completed — with no loss of life on the side of our military — and demanding that a longer process of seeking permission from Congress should have been followed. This would have not only extended the mission timeframe but also alerted Maduro of our intent, giving him ample time to flee, shore up his defenses, and make a mission far more risk-intensive.\n\nBut beyond this impacted thinking, Schumer crying about the move to oust Maduro is, once again, words in defiance of his own words. There was Chuck, during the first Trump term in the White House, lambasting the president for not taking any action to remove the authoritarian and deliver democracy to the Venezuelan people.\n\nAnd now, let us move to the very top of the Hypocritical Party. The Biden administration was certainly big on the concept of having Maduro removed from office, with a stress on the word “concept.” It was all words.\n\nOnce again, we have criticisms hurled about Trump not taking proper action then, as he is now being scorched for doing the very things they were demanding to take place. Basically, Joe Biden’s stance was that, rather than giving Venezuelans their country back to the citizens, he planned to open our doors and allow all Venezuelans into our country, including the violent gangs. \n\nAnd speaking of words, the verbal Salad Shooter herself, former Vice President Kamala Harris, came out with her blathering on the mission, suggesting that we went into Venezuela for empire building. Or for oil. She is not too solid on the cause, but she is certain it was not to stem the drug trade that Maduro was operating. You know, even though it was the very thing he had been charged with and brought to the U.S. to face in court. \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio noted this very reality. And it completely blasts any manufactured talking points from the Democrats into confetti.\n\nREAD MORE: Rubio Destroys the Dem Narrative on Venezuela, Mocks Kamala Harris in the Process\n\nAll of this illustrates what the Democratic Party is about: They want to take the upper hand on talking points, without ever having to actually take action.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy RedState’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Amy Klobuchar considers running","text":"ST PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Democrats’ 2024 candidate for vice president, is ending his bid for a third term amid President Donald Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into the state’s child care programs and its Somali community.\n\nLess than four months after announcing his reelection campaign, Walz said Monday that negative attention and Republican attacks have contributed to an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state,” making it impossible for him to serve full time as governor while also being a candidate to keep his job.\n\n“Every minute that I spend defending my own political interest would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who want to prey on our differences,” Walz said at the state capitol. “So I’ve decided to step out of this race, and I’ll let others worry about the election while I focus on the work that’s in front of me for the next year.”\n\nWalz did not take questions from reporters after speaking for about seven minutes, much of which involved repeating his earlier written statement announcing his decision.\n\n“Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said, referring to the Trump administration withholding funds for the programs and the Republican president’s attacks on Somali immigrants in Minnesota.\n\nWalz did not explicitly acknowledge the impact of a viral video from a right-wing influencer who claimed he’d found rampant fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. But the Trump administration has cited the video in its decision to cut off certain federal funding streams, and the video’s creator, Nick Shirley, was happy to take credit for the governor’s decision.\n\n“I ENDED TIM WALZ,” Shirley posted Monday on social media.\n\nTrump wrote on social media that Walz was not running “because he was caught, REDHANDED” with “stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars,” an accusation against the governor that lacked evidence despite widely acknowledged fraud problems. The president said Walz “has destroyed the State of Minnesota.”\n\nThe candidates to replace Walz\n\nWalz’s exit scrambles the contest in a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans have insisted they can win. Democrats hold 24 of 50 governor’s seats nationwide, with 36 seats, including Minnesota’s, on the ballot this year.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is considering entering the Minnesota race, according to a person close to her. The person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator, who ran for president in 2020, has not made a final decision.\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running. They include MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, an election denier who is close to Trump. They also include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator from Chaska who was the party’s 2022 candidate; state Rep. Kristin Robbins, of Maple Grove; defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor Chris Madel; former executive Kendall Qualls; and former Minnesota GOP Chair David Hann.\n\nA military veteran, union supporter and former high school educator and coach, Walz helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nKamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election after his attack line against Trump and his running mate, then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance — “These guys are just weird” — spread widely.\n\nWalz continued building his national profile since his and Harris’ defeat in November. He was a sharp critic of Trump as he toured early caucus and primary states. In May, he called on Democrats in South Carolina to stand up to the Republican president, saying, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner.”\n\nThere were partisan reactions to Walz’s announcement\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, who led Minnesota Democrats when Walz was first elected governor in 2018, said Walz “entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.” Walz’s guiding principle, Martin added, “has always been showing up and doing the work that actually makes their lives better.”\n\nKlobuchar, posting on X, praised Walz as “a true public servant” who made a “difficult decision” but said nothing about her own pending choice.\n\nAnother Minnesotan, Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, was more succinct, issuing a statement that said only: “Good riddance.”\n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokeswoman Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for “failed leadership” and said the state’s next Democratic candidate “will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.”\n\nWalz stood by his stewardship, saying “a single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud should be intolerable” and insisting that his administration has been working diligently to address the problem.\n\nA look at Walz’s time as governor\n\nDuring his two terms, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nHe used the office’s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and schools, prompting Republican pushback.\n\nRepublicans also were critical of Walz over what they saw as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Walz pleaded for calm after Floyd’s death but stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence.\n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. Minnesota eliminated nearly all the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youths and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Walz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nThat record, combined with Walz’s rural background and experience representing southern Minnesota in Congress, landed him on Harris’ radar after she replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. After a whirlwind search, she opted for Walz over other candidates including North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters but drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.\n\nMore recently, Walz has been frustrated in his efforts to enact new gun control measures following a mass shooting last August at Annunciation School in Minneapolis, which left two children dead and injured dozens. He had hoped to call a special session to consider a list of gun safety proposals.\n\nBarrow reported from Atlanta.","url":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/2026/01/05/tim-walz-drops-bid-minnesota-governor/","image":"https://www.chicagotribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/APTOPIX_Election_2026_Minnesota_Governor_10331-1.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 21:38:39","author":"Bill Barrow,Steve Karnowski","authors":["Bill Barrow","Steve Karnowski"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":391516270,"title":"Minnesota Gov.

In two weeks, Donald Trump will have wrapped up year one of his second four-year stint as president of the United States, and after the events of this past weekend alone, the only thing that's lame is the alliance of elected Democrats, their allies in Resistance Media, and Stage Four Never Trumpers who think every day that Donald Trump wakes up is a bad day. I'd like to think I had a fairly productive weekend. I took down all the Christmas lights and decorations (parts of two days), saw Avatar 3, the Stranger Things 5 finale, and reorganized the garage. By comparison, Donald Trump removed an international drug trafficker holding his country hostage through illegitimate rule, served a 6-year-old arrest warrant in person backed by the might of U.S. Special Forces, and locked him and his wife up in New York City awaiting trial. He also has economically squeezed the mullahcracy in Tehran so tight that protests have entered their ninth consecutive night. And as of last night, the protesters are approaching near parity with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in weapons and overwhelming them in numbers. The people have armed themselves, are fighting for their country, and Trump is giving them rhetorical cover. In short, the President didn't reorganize the garage. He took great steps to reorganize the world to ensure this will once again be the American century. On March 26th, 2020, Donald Trump's Justice Department indicted Nicolas Maduro, the Venezuelan strongman, on multiple charges of narco‑terrorism conspiracy, cocaine importation conspiracy, and possession of machine guns and destructive devices. Four-plus years later into the Joe Biden regency, Maduro rigged the presidential election in Venezuela and claimed he would never leave power. The Biden regency called the election fraudulent, and by January of 2025, when Biden was out to lunch and out the door, the regency behind him called Maduro's rule illegitimate and refused to recognize it. So did the rest of the international community, with the exception of China, Russia, and Cuba. But that's as far as Biden was willing to go. All mumble, no rumble.The difference between Trump's administration and Biden's? Biden claimed to be respected in the world once again, specifically because we wouldn't do anything to enforce our will on the world stage. Trump showed yet again he is a man of action. The final week of Never Trump, Inc.'s 2025 began with full-throated defense for Somali fraud all over the country, scorn at the journalism exposing the fraud, and defense for drug runners getting blown up by land and by sea. The first weekend of 2026 brought a virtual hydra of responses to the Maduro raid and capture. 'It was an act of war' (it wasn't), 'Trump didn't get prior Congressional approval' (he didn't have to), 'the arrest was illegal' (he was Mirandized), 'he was poorly treated while transferred to U.S. soil' (he was treated better than the Americans he took hostage late last week), 'the additional hit on the Hugo Chavez mausoleum was just gratuitous' (I wonder if his remains smelled like sulfure afterwards?), 'it's all just about oil (I'd rather have it than China and Russia), and my favorite - 'okay, well, why you were there, why didn't you arrest every terrorist drug runner working for Maduro?' Let's work our way through how the media covered the surprise raid and arrest of Maduro, because honestly, the story and related clips are just fun for the whole family. On Meet the Press with Kristen Welker, the MVP of the first year of the Trump administration by far, Secretary of State/National Security Advisor/National Archivist/USAID director Marco Rubio easily countered the charge the raid was a naked theft of another country's oil reserves. \n\n🚨 HOLY SMOKES. In an incredible moment, Sec. Marco Rubio declares the Western Hemisphere is OURS, Russia, China and Iran must GET OUTWELKER: Why does the US need Venezuelan oil?!RUBIO: \"Why does CHINA need their oil? Russia? Iran? This is the West, THIS IS WHERE WE LIVE.\"🔥… pic.twitter.com/ZJU6L2BkNo— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 4, 2026\n\nKeep in mind that in the afternoon, before U.S. forces pulled off an operation that literally no other country in the world could pull off, a handful of Communist Chinese Party diplomats met with Maduro to negotiate future oil shipments. I'm not entirely certain they had left the country to return to Beijing before discovering that the paper they had in their hands was now null and void, thanks to Donald Trump and U.S. Armed Forces. This one operation alone accomplished: \n\nNarco-trafficking, which had been constant for the last decade, essentially ends.CCP Secretary-General Xi Jinping loses a foothold in the Western Hemisphere, with roughly $110 billion dollars in loans to Venezuela that were secured by oil as collateral. Those loans are now worthless. The United States, for all intents and purposes, now has a seat in OPEC with the regime change ultimately leading to a more U.S.-friendly government.This raid serves as a double blow to Vladimir Putin in Russia. Venezuela had recently signed an extension to develop and deliver oil to Russia through 2041. That, in all likelihood, is over. In addition, the billion-plus dollars Russia committed to Cuba for infrastructure is heavily dependent upon Venezuelan oil powering it. That's also gone. \n\nWe'll get to what comes next for Venezuela in a bit, because that's very fluid. But back to the media's Trump treatment, we next go to Margaret Brennan on Face the Nation, who must have had Bari Weiss banging her head against a wall after this exchange with Sec. Rubio.\n\n.@SecRubio: \"It is not easy to land a helicopter in the middle of the largest military base... kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, put him in a helicopter... and you're asking me why we didn't do that in five other places at the same time!?\" pic.twitter.com/Pm9Jy1AKp3— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) January 4, 2026\n\nMargaret is a lefty. No doubt about it. And honestly, she's not an idiot. She was openly hyper-partisan in the pre-Weiss era at CBS, and then suddenly began to relearn her journalism chops at times once the new boss moved in. But this exchange? I've got no defense. I don't seem to recall Brennan asking Obama officials why they didn't just kill off all the other jihadi terrorists, including Ayman al-Zawahiri, when Navy SEALs dispatched Osama bin Laden. As I said on X, this is the journalistic equivalent of Clark Griswold's father-in-law coming out in the cold Chicago winter to see the Christmas lights finally work in National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, and noting, disgustedly, that the little lights aren't twinkling. Filling the willfully obtuse lane on the Sunday shows was George Stephanopoulos on ABC's This Week. Rubio explained to him three times what we did and why we did it, and poor George just couldn't summon the brain cells to rub together and understand it all. \n\nABC’s George Stephanopoulos attempted to trip up Secretary of State Marco Rubio by asking the same question about Venezuela three different times.“What is the legal authority for the United States to be running Venezuela?”And three times, Rubio shut him down.RUBIO: “I… pic.twitter.com/HaXJH2AyOv— Overton (@overton_news) January 4, 2026\n\nGeorge Stephanopoulos was a special assistant to President William Jefferson Blythe Clinton when the U.S. fought the Battle of Mogadishu during the Somalia crisis. You'll be surprised to learn that A) Clinton did not seek, nor was he granted, Congressional approval to do so, and B) no one had to explain the 'why' to George. About a year later, after another election that was rigged, Clinton intervened in Haiti to do regime change. Again, on staff, Stephanopoulos didn't seem to have a problem with Clinton's actions, but can't comprehend Trump's actions. He's not that dumb. He's just a partisan hack doing partisan hackery masked as journalism. One way to ascertain how much of a lame duck the current President is, is to investigate what was said about this past weekend by the even lamer duck, the one that Trump beat a year ago. Ten days before Trump took the oath of office, the Biden-Harris administration put out a $25 million dollar bounty on the head of Nicolas Maduro. Nearly a year later, after he was arrested, Harris has had a change of heart.\n\nDonald Trump’s actions in Venezuela do not make America safer, stronger, or more affordable.That Maduro is a brutal, illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise. We’ve seen this movie before. Wars for regime change or oil that…— Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) January 4, 2026\n\nNot exactly a big stick, she's carrying. About the toughest thing Harris has to negotiate these days is how to pierce the top of a box of Sauvignon Blanc with a straw. Chuck Schumer, presumably the leader of the Democratic Party in the United States Senate, was a fierce critic of Donald Trump in 2020 because Trump had failed to act to remove Maduro from power. \n\n2020.

The same media and political left in this country that has been wrong about Donald Trump with Swiss precision accuracy will undoubtedly get it wrong again. International hearts are for Maria Corina Machado, the Nobel Prize winner from 2025 (beating out Donald Trump). She probably did win the 2024 Venezuelan elections, but was cheated out of it by the fraudulant Maduro. Donald Trump and the U.S. military went in and rescued her weeks ago. She would otherwise be the sentimental favorite, except the reality on the ground in Caracas is that the military never respected her, and probably wouldn't respect her now. If she can't control the military, she's not going to control the country, and Trump, Rubio et al. know it. So the plan seems to be to force the next in line to fall in line. That's Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodriguez. Rodriguez is every bit the Marxist whackjob Maduro is, but has shown in the last 48 hours to be as pliable as a paper clip. After the spectacular raid and capture of Maduro and his wife, leaving Russian surface-to-air-defense systems in smoldering piles of scrap metal just like they were in Iran when we took out the nuclear program at four sensitive sites, Rodriguez' initial reaction, from Russia where she was previously dispatched for meetings, was defiance. \n\n“We will never be the colony of any empire,” said Delcy Rodríguez. “What is being done to Venezuela is barbaric.” She is the vice-president whom Donald Trump described as “essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again” https://t.co/tv71fEhUKo— The Economist (@TheEconomist) January 4, 2026\n\nShe also continued in the antisemitic traditions of her ideological grandfather, Hugo Chavez. It's the Joos' fault this happened. \n\nIt took only a few hours for Delcy Rodríguez—Venezuela's vice president—to fabricate an antisemitic conspiracy linking Zionists to the U.S. operation that captured Nicolás Maduro. Antisemites do have a wild imagination! pic.twitter.com/SYntTTanwb— GnasherJew®גנאשר (@GnasherJew) January 4, 2026\n\nYou could almost feel the left begin to seize and pounce. Yes, they do that, too. Seizing and pouncing is not just a Republican skill set. 'Trump's adventurism isn't going to result in any meaningful change,' you could sense would be the line of attack. And that may have been the case with any other president not named Donald John Trump. Instead, it took one telephone interview with the Atlantic to make its way around the world. \n\nIn a telephone interview this morning with The Atlantic, President Donald J. Trump issued a threat against Venezuela’s Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, saying that, “if she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro,” adding that… pic.twitter.com/2xR8kE38ey— OSINTdefender (@sentdefender) January 4, 2026\n\nA price higher than the one Maduro is paying? He's alive, awaiting trial. Trump just showed that America can strike anywhere they want, when they want, on their terms. They had an arrest warrant for Maduro and acted on it, destroying Venezuelan defenses in the meantime. There will be no warrant this time for Rodriguez, and weaker defenses. She'll just get killed, and there's really not anything she can do to stop it if she doesn't play ball. Less than a day after that threat went public, Marco Rubio was suddenly on the phone with a very compliant Rodriguez, pledging total cooperation. \n\nBREAKING: Interim Venezuelan leader Delcy Rodríguez on Sunday night invited U.S. President Donald Trump “to collaborate” and said she seeks “respectful relations” in a newly conciliatory message. https://t.co/kPq8vZ3dwF— The Associated Press (@AP) January 5, 2026\n\nMind you, the Trump administration is not endorsing Rodriguez for any long-term assignment running the country. She's a stopgap for stability, preventing the need for American forces to go in and become peacekeepers. But she's on a short leash and knows it. One of the jerks on her new collar is going to be calling for a new election shortly, and let Venezuelans decide freely and fairly who will govern them next. If it's Machado, so be it. Regardless, the days of the Marxists running the country seem to be limited. It's worth reminding what signal this sends to adversaries of the United States, large and small, around the globe. How soundly do you think despots and dictators are sleeping these days, knowing Trump has three years left and a very cold heart when it comes to those internationally who mean to do Americans harm?Kim Jung Un in North Korea had begun to make noise in late 2024. Heard him rattling any sabers lately? How does Miguel Diaz-Canel in Cuba feel? What about Khamenei? There's a school of thought that believes Trump's action this weekend all but green-lights Xi's desire to go in and take Taiwan. It's a wrong school of thought, but it's certainly a take. Xi has been knocked back in the Middle East. He's just been defeated in South America. And even he does not know if his military and navy, albeit with a quantity advantage, are ready to match up with a resurgent American Armed Forces. The bottom line is this. If you're a bad guy, Trump is out there at the other end of the equation, and thus far, after only a year in, bad guys have gotten the short end every single time. And when Trump does engage kinetically, the new Axis of Evil – Russia, China, North Korea, Iran – is not there to lend a hand. Thus far, whether in Nigeria, Syria, Iran, the Houthis in Yemen, or now Venezuela, being an adversary of the U.S. is a very lonely business. The friends you think you have aren't going to be there when you need them. This is the very heart of America First. The United States is the world's big dog once again after four years of self-doubt caused by a feeble nincompoop and his incompetent word salad of a number two at the helm, and we are safer for it. If that meets your definition of a lame duck, I'll take that six days a week and twice on Sunday. \n\nEditor's note: We now have the room to run outside commentary by some of our favorite and most provocative thinkers on the Right.

Tim Walz would not seek re-election as a sweeping fraud scandal rocks his state. \"Governor Walz has destroyed the State of Minnesota, but others, like Governor Gavin Newscum, JB Pritzker, and Kathy Hochul, have done, in my opinion, an even more dishonest and incompetent job. NO ONE IS ABOVE THE LAW!\" Trump posted to Truth Social Monday afternoon. The message followed Walz announcing Monday that he was withdrawing his re-election effort to continue serving as governor. Walz was first elected the state's top leader in 2018 in a political career that also included him campaigning coast-to-coast in 2024 as former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. \"As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,\" Walz wrote in a statement. \"Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.\" KEVIN MCCARTHY SAYS MINNESOTA'S 'ENTIRE DEMOCRAT ADMINISTRATION' WILL HAVE TO RESIGN OVER FRAUD SCANDAL Minnesota has come under fierce scrutiny in recent weeks as a sprawling fraud scandal that has led to dozens of arrests, mostly from the state's large Somali community, since 2022 comes to light. Minnesota was allegedly home to a massive COVID-era scheme that allegedly involved money laundering operations related to fraudulent meal and housing programs, daycare centers and Medicaid services, according to investigators. The Minnesota fraud is still being tabulated, with local officials speculating it could exceed $1 billion and rise to as high as $9 billion. NICK SHIRLEY GLOATS HE 'ENDED TIM WALZ’ AFTER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR SCRAPS RE-ELECTION BID AMID FRAUD SCANDAL Trump's use of the phrase \"no one is above the law\" follows years of Democrats employing the same rhetoric against him as he faced a barrage of charges and court cases in between his first and second administrations. \"No one is above the law,\" President Joe Biden said after Trump was found guilty on 34 counts of falsified business records in a Manhattan court in May 2024. Trump faced four criminal indictments, which resulted in accusations of \"lawfare\" on the national stage as Trump maintained his innocence and slammed the cases as efforts by the Democratic Party to hurt his political chances for re-election in 2024. DAVID MARCUS: TIM WALZ'S WHITE GUILT FINALLY ENDS HIS CAREER AS MINNESOTA’S FRAUD EXPLODES \"As I’ve said before, no one is above the law, including Donald Trump,\" then-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in 2023 after the Biden administration's Department of Justice announced Trump had been indicted on 37 counts related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. Even during Trump's first administration, Democrats championed the phrase as they combated MAGA Republicans and Trump policies. \"Everybody wants the president to be held accountable in the most serious way,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of Trump in 2019 amid a discussion at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco, underscoring that Democrats believe \"no one is above the law.\" \"And everybody believes, now I'm talking on the Democratic side, that no one is above the law, especially the president of the United States.\" \"We must be clear: no one, not even the president, is above the law,\" Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., said in a statement in 2019 when introducing articles of impeachment against Trump. COMER WARNS WALZ ABSENCE AT MINNESOTA FRAUD HEARING WOULD BE 'ADMISSION TO GUILT' BY GOVERNOR Upon his victory over the Harris–Walz presidential ticket in 2024, Trump has taken a victory lap for allegedly snuffing out the weaponization of government. \"We have ended weaponized government, where, as an example, a sitting president is allowed to viciously prosecute his political opponent, like me. How did that work out?\" he said during his joint address to Congress in 2025. \"Not too good. Not too good.\" Trump added in his Monday Truth Social post that \"Minnesota’s Corrupt Governor will possibly leave office before his Term is up,\" and that he's confident the fraud investigations \"will reveal a seriously unscrupulous, and rich, group of 'SLIMEBALLS.'\" White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson added in comment to Fox Digital on Monday afternoon when asked about the Truth Social post: \"It shouldn’t take an education from the Quality Learing Center for Democrats to understand this: Tim Walz and his Somali friends have been caught ripping off hardworking Minnesota taxpayers and now they will face the consequences. President Trump is right, no one is above the law.\" Walz has taken ownership of correcting the fraud. He said his administration had been taking action to stop some suspected fraudulent payments over the summer and that his office referred some for prosecution.

Tim Walz announced Monday that he is ending his re-election campaign for a third term.\n\nIn a statement, Walz, who ran with Kamala Harris as the Democratic vice-presidential nominee during her 2024 presidential bid against Donald Trump, cited allegations of fraud in the Minnesota government and “political gamesmanship” by Republicans, which he said intended to cause division among state residents, as his reasons for bowing out of the race.\n\nDespite announcing in September that he would run for a record-breaking third term, the state governor said he could no longer give his all to a political campaign.\n\n“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences,” he said.\n\n“So I’ve decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.”\n\nWalz claimed in his statement that scammers have acted deceitfully within the state government, a problem he said he and fellow lawmakers are working to address while fending off hostility from the federal government.\n\n“For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state’s generosity. And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis,” Walz said, before accusing President Trump of stoking the fire.\n\n“I won’t mince words here. Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbours,” he said, citing the federal government’s recent freezing of tax dollars allocated to fund child-care services following allegations of fraud and of demonizing immigrant communities, specifically Somali nationals residing in Minnesota.\n\nIn December, Trump called Somali immigrants “garbage,” claiming they were too reliant on U.S. social safety nets and gave nothing back to the country.\n\n“They contribute nothing. I don’t want them in our country,” Trump told reporters.\n\n“Their country is no good for a reason. Your country stinks and we don’t want them in our country,” he added.\n\nTrump ramped up his attacks on Somalis last month when Christopher Rufo, a conservative activist, published unsubstantiated allegations in a magazine called City Journal, citing unnamed sources that money stolen from Minnesota state programs had gone to al-Shabab, an al-Qaeda-linked militant group that controls parts of Somalia.\n\nMinnesota’s Department of Children, Youth, and Families said on Friday that investigators found child-care facilities accused of fraud were operating “as expected” and legally, NBC News reported.\n\nIn 2022, 47 suspects were indicted for defrauding a federally funded Minnesota-based child nutrition program of more than $250 million. Some of the criminal cases related to the alleged scheme are still open, according to the U.S. outlet, and several of the defendants are of Somali descent.\n\nWalz, who acknowledged that fraud within state government needs to be remedied, reiterated that many changes had been made to curb unlawful activity, including firing people who were not doing their jobs and jailing bad actors who stole from the state.\n\nHe called Trump’s targeting of Somali people “disgusting and dangerous,” and said he will not tolerate a single taxpayer dollar being lost to fraudulent activity.\n\n“We’ve cut off whole streams of funding, in partnership with the federal government, where we saw widespread criminal activity. We’ve put new locks on the doors of our remaining programs, and we’ve hired a new head of program integrity to make sure those locks can’t be broken.”\n\n“The buck stops with me,” he said. “My administration is taking fast, decisive action to solve this crisis. And we will win the fight against the fraudsters.”\n\nWalz’s unexpected resignation from the race sent a political shockwave through the state. The former vice-presidential nominee faced no serious primary threat to his tenure and was touted to secure a third term. It is unclear who will run in his place.\n\nWalz’s announcement bookends months of violent political tumult in the northern U.S. state, including the murders of former Minnesota state Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman, who were killed by gunfire inside their home in June. On the same night, John Hoffman, a Minnesota lawmaker, and his wife, Yvette Hoffman, were critically wounded after being shot 17 times between them. Both of them survived.\n\nWalz concluded on Monday by thanking Minnesota residents and reaffirming his commitment to his role as governor.\n\n“I want Minnesotans to know that I’m on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America’s best place to live and raise kids. No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the president. Not on my watch.”\n\n— With files from The Associated Press","summary":"Despite Tim Walz announcing he would run for a record-breaking third term as Minnesota governor, he says he can no longer give his all to a political campaign.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11599616/tim-walz-not-seeking-reelection-governor-race-minnesota/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/CP175576749.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 20:54:12","author":"Rachel Goodman","authors":["Rachel Goodman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":391510438,"title":"Minnesota Gov.

Tim Walz drops third-term bid","text":"ST PAUL, Minn. — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Democrats’ 2024 candidate for vice president, is ending his bid for a third term amid President Donald Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into the state’s child care programs and its Somali community.\n\nLess than four months after announcing his reelection campaign, Walz said Monday that negative attention and Republican attacks have contributed to an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state,” making it impossible for him to serve full time as governor while also being a candidate to keep his job.\n\n“Every minute that I spend defending my own political interest would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who want to prey on our differences,” Walz said at the state capitol. ”So I’ve decided to step out of this race, and I’ll let others worry about the election while I focus on the work that’s in front of me for the next year.”\n\nWalz did not take questions from reporters after speaking for about seven minutes, much of which involved repeating his earlier written statement announcing his decision.\n\n“Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said, referring to the Trump administration withholding funds for the programs and the Republican president’s attacks on Somali immigrants in Minnesota.\n\nWalz did not explicitly acknowledge the impact of a viral video from a right-wing influencer who claimed he’d found rampant fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. \n\nBut the Trump administration has cited the video in its decision to cut off certain federal funding streams, and the video’s creator, Nick Shirley, was happy to take credit for the governor’s decision.\n\n“I ENDED TIM WALZ,” Shirley posted Monday on social media.\n\nTrump wrote on social media that Walz was not running “because he was caught, REDHANDED” with “stealing Tens of Billions of Taxpayer Dollars,” an accusation against the governor that lacked evidence despite widely acknowledged fraud problems. The president said Walz “has destroyed the State of Minnesota.”\n\nThe candidates to replace Walz\n\nWalz’s exit scrambles the contest in a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans have insisted they can win. Democrats hold 24 of 50 governor’s seats nationwide, with 36 seats, including Minnesota’s, on the ballot this year.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is considering entering the Minnesota race, according to a person close to her. The person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator, who ran for president in 2020, has not made a final decision.\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running. They include MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, an election denier who is close to Trump. They also include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator from Chaska who was the party’s 2022 candidate; state Rep. Kristin Robbins, of Maple Grove; defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor Chris Madel; former executive Kendall Qualls; and former Minnesota GOP Chair David Hann.\n\nA military veteran, union supporter and former high school educator and coach, Walz helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nKamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election after his attack line against Trump and his running mate, then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance — “These guys are just weird” — spread widely.\n\nWalz continued building his national profile since his and Harris’ defeat in November. He was a sharp critic of Trump as he toured early caucus and primary states. In May, he called on Democrats in South Carolina to stand up to the Republican president, saying, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner.”\n\nThere were partisan reactions to Walz’s announcement\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, who led Minnesota Democrats when Walz was first elected governor in 2018, said Walz “entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.” Walz’s guiding principle, Martin added, “has always been showing up and doing the work that actually makes their lives better.”\n\nKlobuchar, posting on X, praised Walz as “a true public servant” who made a “difficult decision” but said nothing about her own pending choice.\n\nAnother Minnesotan, Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, was more succinct, issuing a statement that said only: “Good riddance.”\n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokeswoman Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for “failed leadership” and said the state’s next Democratic candidate “will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.”\n\nWalz stood by his stewardship, saying “a single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud should be intolerable” and insisting that his administration has been working diligently to address the problem.\n\nA look at Walz’s time as governor\n\nDuring his two terms, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nHe used the office’s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and schools, prompting Republican pushback.\n\nRepublicans also were critical of Walz over what they saw as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd, a Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Walz pleaded for calm after Floyd’s death but stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence.\n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. Minnesota eliminated nearly all the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youths and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. \n\nWalz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nThat record, combined with Walz’s rural background and experience representing southern Minnesota in Congress, landed him on Harris’ radar after she replaced Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. After a whirlwind search, she opted for Walz over other candidates including North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters but drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.\n\nMore recently, Walz has been frustrated in his efforts to enact new gun control measures following a mass shooting last August at Annunciation School in Minneapolis, which left two children dead and injured dozens. He had hoped to call a special session to consider a list of gun safety proposals.\n\nBy STEVE KARNOWSKI and BILL BARROW Associated Press.","url":"https://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/2026/01/05/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-drops-political-bombshell-bows-out-of-third-term-bid/","image":"https://dmn-dallas-news-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/7UQUXDSNU5A2JBHF5RQIPBE7KE.jpg?auth=0d0742762844eb94b86653f070eca38c83910ef0126b8a28a706a21fa41da18f&quality=80&width=1200&height=630&smart=true","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 20:41:39","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":391497484,"title":"Eric Adams torches Harris, Dems for blasting Maduro arrest as Mamdani fumes ‘act of war’","text":"Just two days after posting a social media video signaling his freedom from government office, former New York Mayor Eric Adams slammed fellow Democrats over their response to President Donald Trump’s operation to capture Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro. Adams previously posted a video of himself with a cigar and what appeared to be bourbon, smiling as he lambasted the government as \"slow as s---\" filled with people trying to throw \"sand in the gears\" and predicting an \"unforgettable, bada--, no bull---- 2026\" – before issuing a starkly different message on Maduro than his mayoral successor. By the weekend, Adams followed through, openly weighing in by thanking Trump for \"hit[ting] the cartels where it hurts\" through Maduro’s detention and sharply criticizing former Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Joe Biden’s approach to the Venezuelan strongman. \"I have seen firsthand how Nicolás Maduro destroyed Venezuela and turned it into a narco-state. Millions fled. Thousands landed in New York City,\" he said. GREGG JARRETT: NO, TRUMP'S ORDER TO SNATCH MADURO WAS NOT ILLEGAL OR UNCONSTITUTIONAL \"Now in U.S. custody, the man who helped flood our streets with fentanyl is finally being held accountable. American lives were destroyed because of him.\" Turning to those in his party, Adams said that days before Biden and Harris left office, they increased the bounty on Maduro to $25 million from an Obama-era $10 million. Harris had said that Trump’s detaining of Maduro \"do[es] not make America safer\" and that the despot being an \"illegitimate dictator does not change the fact that this action was both unlawful and unwise … The American people do not want this, and they are tired of being lied to.\" LAWMAKERS RIP BIDEN AFTER TRUMP-MADURO TAUNT RESURFACES – CALL IT BASELESS AND POLITICALLY CHARGED \"Public safety is not a political game,\" Adams replied to Harris. \"You do not label someone a narco-dictator one year and then pretend he is no longer a threat the next simply because a different president is in office – that is cynical and irresponsible,\" Adams said, citing Harris’ lengthier critique of the overnight operation. Adams went on to cite real-life cases of fentanyl deaths in New York as proof of Maduro’s dangerous reach, including a two-year-old Bronx boy named Nicholas Feliz-Dominici whom he said was poisoned while in daycare.

His wife Gwen seemed close to tears.\n\nPerhaps they were thinking of what might have been had Walz and Kamala Harris triumphed in 2024. Instead of sitting in the US Naval Observatory, the home of the Vice President, he now leaves public life after one of the most calamitous cameos of modern times.\n\nIndeed, it wasn't even immediately clear where the couple would live after Walz's final day in office as Minnesota governor next January. Walz sold his own house in July 2019 for $304,000 and moved into a state-funded home. There was still a $250,000 mortgage on it at the time. \n\nIn the end, Walz was a casualty of the Minnesota welfare scandal that has exploded onto the national stage in recent days, with much more of a bang than he himself did in the 2024 campaign.\n\nOn Monday, he ended his bid for a third term as governor, admitting that the fraud happened 'on my watch' and that the 'buck does stop with me.'\n\nWalz conceded: 'For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity.'\n\nHowever, when it came to his own downfall, he refused to take responsibility, instead blaming 'conspiracy theorist right-wing YouTubers' and the White House.\n\nHe accused President Trump of 'demonizing our Somali neighbors,' which was 'disgusting and dangerous,' he said.\n\nThe reaction from Republicans was mixed, with Walz's demise being regarded as long overdue. However, he was also seen as one of the easiest and most useful political punching bags on the Democratic side.\n\nAmid the ongoing scandal, Walz has been summoned to appear before a congressional committee on Wednesday, and the Trump administration called it 'one of the largest frauds in American history and probably the largest theft of public welfare dollars.'\n\nFederal charges have been filed against 98 people accused of embezzlement of public funds and, according to Attorney General Pam Bondi, 85 of the defendants are 'of Somali descent'. Minnesota has the largest Somali population in America.\n\nFifty-seven people, most of them Somali, have already been convicted in the scheme to divert $300 million in public grants intended to distribute free meals to children, according to prosecutors.\n\nThose involved are accused of faking invoices, attendance records and meal deliveries, and spending the money on items including Lamborghinis, Porsches, and property in the Maldives.\n\nRepublicans accused Democrats in Minnesota of turning a blind eye to numerous warnings because the scandal involved the state's Somali community, the largest in the country, with around 80,000 members.\n\nThe case first became public in 2022 but was injected into the national consciousness over the recent Christmas period after YouTuber Nick Shirley released a viral video focusing on day care centers in Minnesota.\n\nThat video was watched 127 million times on X and the Trump administration responded by surging fraud investigators to Minnesota and freezing federal child care payments to the state.\n\nWalz has found himself at the center of the storm, and it is far from the first time.\n\nFrom the moment Harris made the fateful decision to select him, the 61-year-old has been mired in gaffes and scandal. \n\nHarris's aim was to appeal to Midwestern voters, with Walz touting his status as a gun owner and hunter.\n\nHowever, when he invited the media to follow him on a pheasant hunt through long grass, it ended in farce.\n\nSocial media commentators accused Walz of 'staging' the event because other men with him had orange vests on but no guns.\n\nVideo showed him struggling to load his shotgun and he reportedly did not fire a single shot during the three-hour hunt.\n\nWhile most politicians on a presidential ticket have a major controversy to deal with, he had at least half a dozen.\n\nPerhaps the most damaging involved questions over why, as a national guardsman, he did not deploy to Iraq with his unit in 2006, having retired the year before.\n\nBut there were also accusations that he inflated his resume as a high school football coach.\n\nIn a huge embarrassment, Walz himself admitted 'misspeaking' after claiming to have been in Hong Kong when the Tiananmen Square massacre took place in Beijing in 1989.\n\nBut he had been to communist China dozens of times, and a congressional investigation was launched into his links to the communist country.\n\nIn a further humiliation, Republicans nicknamed him 'Tampon Tim' for signing a 2023 law requiring that Minnesota schools provide menstruation supplies in boys' restrooms.\n\nHis economic record in the state was quickly trashed, and his own financial competence was called into question.\n\nExperts had been surprised when Harris picked him over the frontrunner, Governor Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, and her aides indicated it was due to personal chemistry.\n\nBut Walz proceeded to engage awkwardly in public with Harris, and commentators described some of their early appearances together as stilted.\n\nIn one social media video he shared with Harris his recipe for 'white guy tacos.'\n\nThen, in his big moment, Walz was widely seen to have been outclassed by J.D. Vance, a younger man with much less political experience, in the vice presidential debate.\n\nOne influential pollster told the Daily Mail it was the moment Vance made his mark with the public, and Walz allowed him to do so.\n\nWalz licked his wounds and returned to Minnesota, any dreams of running for the White House himself in 2028 dashed.\n\nIn retrospect, his downfall had begun the moment Democrats appeared to inflate his football coaching resume at the party's Chicago convention in the summer of 2024.\n\nThe tale went that, in 1999, Walz had turned around Mankato West High School's football team from 0-27 into state champions in an underdog triumph for the ages.\n\nPlayers for the team were brought on stage and Amy Klobuchar, who ironically may now tun to replace him as governor, told the crowd: 'In Minnesota, we trust a coach who turned a team that was 0-27 into state champions.'\n\nIn fact, the head coach of the all-conquering side known as the 'Scarlets' was a man named Rick Sutton.\n\nWalz, a social studies teacher, had been one of several assistant coaches under Sutton, working primarily with the defensive players.\n\nScrutiny then fell on Walz's trips to China in the days when he was a teacher.\n\nOf particular note was his claim to have been in Hong Kong on June 4, 1989 – the day when the Chinese authorities massacred pro-democracy demonstrators in Tiananmen Square.\n\nSpeaking to a 2009 hearing of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China to mark the 20-year anniversary of the massacre, Walz recalled his trip.\n\nHe said: 'Twenty years ago today, I was in Hong Kong preparing to go to Foshan to teach. To watch what happened at the end of the day on June 4 was something that many of us will never forget, we pledge to never forget, and bearing witness and accurate telling of history is absolutely crucial for any nation to move forward.'\n\nWalz made this claim on more than one occasion, but newspaper reports of the time place him nowhere near Hong Kong or China.\n\nIn an excruciating moment during the vice-presidential debate, watched by millions of voters, Walz conceded that he had 'misspoken' and said: 'I'm a knucklehead at times.'\n\nBut perhaps more damaging to his reputation was the controversy over his military record.\n\nWalz served 24 years in the Nebraska and Minnesota Army National Guard.\n\nIn a 2018 video advocating for stricter gun-control laws, he said: 'We can make sure that those weapons of war, that I carried in war, is the only place where those weapons are at.'\n\nThe phrase 'that I carried in war' was taken by many to suggest that Walz had served in a combat zone.\n\nHowever, Walz was only ever deployed to Italy in 2003 to provide security at a U.S. military base that was involved in supporting the ongoing Afghanistan war effort.\n\nTo address the matter, the Harris-Walz campaign issued a statement to say that Walz 'misspoke' - again.\n\nBut Walz himself seemed reluctant to admit a mistake.\n\nIn a joint CNN interview with Harris, he was asked to confirm that he had misspoken, but his answer appeared evasive.\n\n'My wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar is not always correct,' he said.\n\nMeanwhile, he was lambasted by members of his own former unit for his decision to retire from the National Guard shortly before they were deployed to Iraq in 2005.\n\nVance, who served with the US Marines in Iraq, called that decision 'absolutely shameful.'\n\nIt also emerged that Walz, in campaign literature for a 2006 bid to represent Minnesota in the House of Representatives, was described as a 'retired command sergeant major.'\n\nThe same description was used on the Harris-Walz website in 2024.\n\nHowever, even though Walz did briefly serve as a command sergeant major, he did not keep that title after retirement.\n\nInstead, he retired as a lower-ranking 'master sergeant', having never completed the coursework required to retain the more senior title.\n\nThe mother of Kye Miller, a Minnesotan who was killed by a roadside bomb in Iraq on June 29, 2006, slammed Walz at the time.\n\nShe told the Daily Mail: 'To publicly present false prestige of his unearned rank, an inaccurate representation, is a falsehood of who he truly is.'\n\nThe Harris-Walz campaign was forced to edit its website to correct the mistake.\n\nIt was far from the first scandal Walz had been through.\n\nBefore his political career, when he was a teacher, he was stopped by police while driving at 96mph in a 55mph zone near Chadron, Nebraska.\n\nA blood test showed his alcohol level was above the state's legal limit, and his lawyer admitted in court that he had been drinking.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to a charge of reckless driving, lost his license for 90 days, and paid a fine of $200.\n\nA decade later, when he ran for Congress, the incident emerged and his team claimed that he had not been drinking.\n\n'The DUI charge was dropped for a reason: it wasn't true,' his team said.\n\nThey claimed that Walz had only failed a sobriety test because of hearing loss he incurred while serving in the National Guard – and that he had been allowed to drive himself to jail.\n\nThe full truth later emerged - that he had been drinking and was driven to the police station in the back of a police car.\n\nHaving survived such a litany of scandals, Walz came within reach of the office of vice president.\n\nOn Monday, as he announced he would not run for Minnesota governor again, he said he had 'zero sadness and zero regret.'\n\nLike some of his other statements, that one was a little hard to believe.","summary":"Walz could not survive the Minnesota welfare scandal that has exploded on to the national stage in recent days.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15436435/Tim-Walz-final-humiliation-excruciating-unraveling-Tampon-Tim-filled-gaffes-excuses-calamitous-VP-cameo.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/05/18/105250473-0-image-a-28_1767638348640.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/17/1967700321714749393/1024x576_MP4_1967700321714749393.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-05 20:24:48","author":"Editor,Nick Allen","authors":["Editor","Nick Allen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":391515440,"title":"Here’s How Trump Brought Accountability to MN – and Torched Tim Walz’s Political Career in the Process","text":"When Minnesota Governor Tim Walz (D) made the blockbuster announcement Monday that he would not be seeking reelection, he focused his ire squarely in one direction: at President Donald Trump. It was Trump, said Walz, who wanted to \"make our state a colder, meaner place\" by \"attacking our neighbors.\"\n\nBy \"neighbors,\" Kamala Harris's running mate, of course, means the Somali community to which the Democrat Party can't seem to pander enough. It's this very community that has brought the failures of Walz and his fellow Minnesota Democrats into sharp focus as the Trump administration takes action to uncover the extent of the fraud being committed in the Land of 10,000 Lakes.\n\nDEEP DIVE: It's Official – Tim Walz Won't Seek Reelection As His Political Career Goes Down in Flames\n\nThe Trump/Bondi DOJ Is Aggressively Pursuing Multiple Fraud Investigations in MN; Here Are the Details\n\nAnd, to Walz's point, the administration is taking decisive and comprehensive action to, in the words of the White House, \"crush Minnesota’s fraud epidemic.\" It all starts with the Department of Justice (DOJ), which is \"engaged in multiple active, ongoing, and extensive investigations into the fraudulent activity that has occurred in various Minnesota programs, including the state’s Feeding Our Future, Housing Stabilization Services, Early Intensive Developmental and Behavioral Intervention programs, and Evergreen Recovery.\"\n\nThere have been 98 defendants charged by the DOJ in fraud-related cases – the majority of those charged are from the Somali community – with 64 convictions already secured. Furthermore, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is currently investigating dozens of Minnesota's health care and home daycare providers who are accused of fraud, and who possibly have links to elected officials and terrorist financing.\n\nThese efforts by the DOJ and the FBI are just the beginning, with the Department of Homeland Security going door-to-door investigating suspected fraud sites and ramping up immigration enforcement operations in Minnesota. And the Department of Health and Human Services has frozen federal childcare payments to the state and is investigating its Head Start programs over allegations of fraud being committed by illegal aliens.\n\nIn addition, several other departments and agencies are taking action to ensure accountability:\n\nThe Small Business Administration has halted all annual grant program payments to Minnesota. The agency also suspended 6,900 borrowers in the state for approximately $400 million in suspected fraudulent activity — banning the individuals from all further loan programs, including disaster loans.The Department of Housing and Urban Development has dispatched a team to Minnesota to conduct a wide-ranging investigation into possible public housing assistance fraud.The Department of Labor is currently conducting a targeted review of Minnesota’s Unemployment Insurance program.The Department of Agriculture has demanded Minnesota conduct recertification for its SNAP recipients to ensure the program complies with eligibility requirements — a commonsense move inexplicably challenged in court by state officials.\n\nAll of the federal attention being paid to his state, it seems, was simply too much for Tim Walz, who said Monday, “Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St. Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.”\n\nDespite Tim Walz's efforts to frame this as a political hit on him and Minnesota, what's actually happening here is a Trump-sized dose of accountability, something that was long overdue. And Walz is bailing, hoping to quietly exit stage right instead of letting the voters decide his fate. It's clear the Trump administration has other plans.\n\nEditor’s Note: Help us continue to report the truth about corrupt politicians like Tim Walz.\n\nJoin RedState VIP and use promo code FIGHT to get 60% off your membership.","url":"https://redstate.com/terichristoph/2026/01/05/heres-what-the-trump-administration-is-doing-to-crush-minnesotas-fraud-epidemic-n2197780","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/351/14a3323c-2d28-4449-a33c-7af6ccb1a3e8.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 20:21:54","author":"Teri Christoph","authors":["Teri Christoph"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.109},{"id":391491776,"title":"Will Amy Klobuchar run for Minnesota governor? Buzz around senator’s future after Tim Walz’s shock decision to bow out of race","text":"Sen. Amy Klobuchar is said to be seriously considering a run for Minnesota governor now that incumbent Gov. Tim Walz has abruptly decided to bow out of the race. \n\nWhile it’s unclear when she will make a final decision on whether to run, the four-term senator is believed to have been getting some encouragement to jump into the race to succeed Walz (D), who dropped out amid a firestorm over a massive welfare fraud scandal that ensued under his watch.\n\n“Governor Walz made the difficult decision to focus on his job and the challenges facing our state rather than campaigning and running for reelection,” Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said in response to Walz’s announcement. \n\n“He has always dedicated his career to delivering for Minnesota — from providing school breakfast and lunches to our kids to passing gun safety legislation to maintaining our state’s AAA bond rating. He is a true public servant.”\n\nBefore publicly announcing his shocking decision, Walz had privately met with Klobuchar on Sunday, CNN reported. Details of their discussion aren’t clear. \n\nWalz had launched his reelection bid last September, seeking to become the first incumbent Minnesota governor to notch a third consecutive term since terms were expanded to four years in 1963.\n\nBut on Monday, Walz, former Vice President Kamala Harris’ veep pick in the 2024 race, abruptly withdrew.\n\n“As I reflected on this moment with my family and my team over the holidays, I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,” he said in a statement.\n\n“Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.”\n\nThe decision came as prosecutors have slapped charges against roughly 90 individuals for swindling Minnesota taxpayers. \n\nWhile estimates of the total theft vary, it is thought to be at least $1 billion, with First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson claiming late last year that the fraud could be $9 billion or more. \n\nThe swindling of taxpayer dollars was largely perpetrated by members of Minnesota’s Somali population, where people set up bogus nonprofits to get state funding to provide services to the homeless, hungry, and individuals in need of daycare for their children. \n\nThe Trump administration has stepped up scrutiny of Minnesota in response. More charges over the sweeping Minnesota fraud scandal are expected in the coming weeks.\n\nSeemingly clearing the way for a Klobuchar bid for governor, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan confirmed that she intends to remain in her race to succeed retiring Sen. Tina Smith (D-Minn.), rather than vie for governor.\n\n“Since his time as a teacher, Governor Walz has led with decency and compassion,” she said in a statement. “Today’s decision reflects who he has always been — someone who puts Minnesotans first.”\n\n“I am proud to call him a friend and proud of all the work that has been done to make Minnesota the best place to raise a family.”\n\nPrior to her ascension to the Senate in 2007, Klobuchar served as the County Attorney of Hennepin County. She also vied unsuccessfully for the Democratic nod for president in 2020. \n\nIf she were to enter the gubernatorial race, Klobuchar would join three of her Senate peers in running for governor: Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), and Michael Bennet (D-Col.)\n\nKlobuchar has won all of her Senate bids by double digits.","summary":"Sen.

This is in the best interest, clearly, of the United States.’ But they're in a position where they're so afraid of a Democrat primary that they will say anything to avoid having the extreme left attack them.\" GOP LAWMAKER SAYS DEMOCRATS HAVE ‘EGG ON THEIR FACE’ AFTER TRUMP’S CAPTURE OF VENEZUELA’S MADURO He pointed out that it was the previous Democratic commander-in-chief, President Joe Biden, who raised the federal government’s bounty for Maduro’s capture to $25 million. \"What did they expect was then going to happen? You think this guy was just going to voluntarily give up? He clearly was not. He was getting into bed with the Cubans, the Russians, the Chinese, the Iranians, even Hezbollah, as I understand.

Democrats and Republicans have been largely divided in their responses to the strikes in Venezuela. KAMALA HARRIS BLASTS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S CAPTURE OF VENEZUELA’S MADURO AS ‘UNLAWFUL AND UNWISE’ Lawmakers on the left have mostly criticized the president and his officials, accusing them of illegal actions that ran afoul of the U.S. Constitution. Some progressives have even said Trump could be guilty of impeachable offenses. The majority of GOP lawmakers praised Trump’s move as a necessary law enforcement action to get rid of a hostile actor threatening both the U.S. and the region writ large. Haridopolos is no different, pointing out that the operation was carried out with no U.S. fatalities and relatively few among Maduro supporters in Venezuela. He said his district is home to a number of Venezuelan refugees who were elated by President Donald Trump’s decision to strike Caracas and capture Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.

Although initially intended to be short-term, the closures were repeatedly extended through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, according to Ballotpedia. For the following school year, Walz gave districts some flexibility, but his guidance generally favored remote or hybrid learning. Minnesota schools remained in limited in-person instruction significantly longer than many Republican-led states.\n\nIn July 2020, Walz implemented a statewide mask mandate in another executive order, requiring face coverings in most indoor public spaces. The mandate, issued under his March 2020 declaration of a peacetime emergency, remained in effect for roughly ten months before being lifted in May 2021.\n\nIn August 2020, the Upper Midwest Law Center filed suit on behalf of 16 Minnesota residents, small businesses and churches, challenging Walz’s mask mandate as an overreach of his emergency powers. The lawsuit alleged conflicts with state law, constitutional violations, and unworkable enforcement burdens on businesses.\n\nThat same year, Walz issued Executive Orders 20-94 and 20-95, granting schools additional time to prepare for distance and hybrid learning, discouraging teachers from juggling in-person and remote instruction simultaneously, and extending remote learning options further into the school year.\n\nThe legal battle over Walz’s emergency powers dragged on for years. Lower courts initially dismissed the lawsuit or deemed it moot after the mandate expired, but in 2023, the Minnesota Supreme Court partially reversed the mootness ruling and remanded the case for review on whether the Emergency Management Act permitted peacetime emergencies for public health crises. The Court of Appeals ruled in July that Walz had acted lawfully, a decision the Minnesota Supreme Court affirmed in 2024 — upholding the state’s broad emergency powers while rendering challenges to the expired mandate moot.\n\n On Transgender Day of Visibility, we celebrate Minnesota’s transgender community and recommit to standing up for our neighbors in the face of hatred.

In March 2023, he signed Executive Order 23-03 to safeguard access to “gender-affirming” health care in Minnesota. The following month, he signed HF 146, positioning Minnesota as a “sanctuary” or “refuge” state for transgender individuals, including those fleeing states where such care faces restrictions or bans. (RELATED: ‘It’s All Bullsh*t’: Tim Walz Goes On Anti-Second Amendment Rant)\n\nIn May 2023, Walz signed HF 44 into law, requiring public and charter schools to provide free menstrual products to all “menstruating students” in grades 4-12. The gender-neutral statute mandates availability “in restrooms regularly used by students,” accommodating biologically female students regardless of which bathroom they use.\n\nOn the 2024 campaign trail, after being selected as former Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, Walz’s past statements about his military service, teaching career, and time in China resurfaced under renewed scrutiny.\n\nVice President JD Vance and other Republican critics accused Walz of “stolen valor,” claiming he exaggerated his service by implying combat experience and noting that he retired before his unit deployed to Iraq.\n\nThe Harris campaign had shared a video in which Walz, supporting a weapons ban after the 2018 Parkland shooting, said he wanted to ban the weapons he “carried in war.” Vance argued the statement overstated Walz’s combat role and alleged that Walz left the National Guard ahead of his unit’s Iraq deployment, implying he abandoned his fellow soldiers, NPR and PBS reported.\n\n Gov. @Tim_Walz: I spent 25 years in the Army and I hunt.

He later acknowledged in the vice presidential debate that he had “misspoke” about the timing.\n\nMost recently, Walz has been embroiled in a massive fraud scandal.

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has launched an investigation into what he describes as “widespread fraud” under Walz’s watch, questioning whether the state ignored early warnings.\n\nOther fraud cases have surfaced as well, including schemes in Minnesota’s Housing Stabilization Services and Medicaid-funded autism therapy programs, where providers allegedly billed for services never delivered, diverting millions in state and federal funds.\n\nSome Republican lawmakers in Minnesota have called for Walz to resign, arguing that his administration’s sluggish response allowed the fraud to metastasize before stronger audits and enforcement measures were implemented, according to The Washington Examiner.","summary":"Here's Everything Tim Walz Got Away With As Minnesota Governor","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2026/01/05/tim-walz-minnesota-governor-somali-fraud-covid-tampons-tiananmen-square-stolen-valor-fraud/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F01%2FGettyImages-2221809509-scaled-e1767642636777.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 20:05:34","author":"Ashley Brasfield","authors":["Ashley Brasfield"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.385},{"id":391486296,"title":"Tim Walz’s decision not to seek 3rd term may end lengthy MN political career","text":"Gov. Tim Walz ended his bid for a third term as Minnesota governor Monday — seeming to cap a political career that sent the former teacher and National Guard veteran all the way to national stage when he was named Kamala Harris’ running mate in 2024.\n\nThat year he joined Hubert Humphrey and Walter Mondale as Minnesotans to be on a national ticket.\n\nWalz, a Democrat, got involved in politics during the 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign. He was first elected to Congress in 2006, defeating incumbent U.S. Rep. Gil Gutknecht, a Republican, in Minnesota’s 1st District. The largely rural district covers much of the southern portion of the state and is seen as fairly conservative.\n\nWhile in Congress Walz was on the Agriculture, Armed Services and Veteran Affairs committees.\n\nIn 2017, Walz announced he was running for governor. He was elected the next year, defeating GOP candidate Jeff Johnson. He and running mate Peggy Flanagan at the time chalked up their victory to their theme of “One Minnesota,” a relatively centrist message that they would seek common ground across the state. Walz won re-election in 2022 defeating Dr. Scott Jensen.\n\nA hunter, Walz was something of a moderate and even had the endorsement of the NRA early in his career. However, after becoming governor he would sign a number of gun-control bills.\n\nPandemic, riots\n\nDuring the pandemic in 2020 Walz ordered all nonessential workers to stay at home and called for the closure of schools and banned large public gatherings. During the pandemic he directed hundreds of millions of dollars in state and federal relief funds to local governments, food shelves and food banks.\n\nAlso in 2020 George Floyd was killed by a Minneapolis police officer sparking riots in Minneapolis and St. Paul. Walz activated the National Guard in response though critics said it should have happened sooner.\n\nIn an interview with the Pioneer Press months afterward, he noted the challenges of that time.\n\n“I’m not going to make the case that every decision we made was correct, but I can assure people that we made it with the best data at the time, with the best interests of Minnesota at heart,” Walz said.\n\n2023 Legislature, 2024 campaign\n\nThe 2023 Legislature — under DFL control — passed a $72 billion budget that Walz and DFLers called the “One Minnesota” budget.\n\nIt included bills to create $1.5 billion in new child tax credits, boost funding for education by $2.2 billion and provide free public college tuition to people from families earning $80,000 or less each year. It also provided free meals to Minnesota students regardless of income.\n\nGOP critics point to billions in new taxes in the budget despite the state’s historic $17.5 billion budget surplus. And, they disputed Walz’s “One Minnesota” characterization, saying the bills had minimal input from the minority — which represents districts containing just under half of the state’s population.\n\nWalz was named as Harris’ running mate in 2024 after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. He didn’t hesitate to paint his political opponents in a negative light.\n\n“These are weird people on the other side. They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,” Walz said in a TV interview during the campaign.\n\nWhile Harris seemed to think Walz would help shore up her campaign in the Midwest, the ticket went on to lose to Donald Trump and JD Vance. Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania — once part of the so-called “Blue Wall” — went for the Republican ticket.\n\nNew fraud cases\n\nNews of fraud in state-run Medicaid programs has garnered significant attention in recent months, but before that came the $250 million Feeding Our Future scandal.\n\nIn that case, the now 78 defendants have been accused of claiming reimbursement from the state education department for meals they never served in a federal pandemic children’s food program. More than 50 have been convicted.\n\nAt a news conference last month announcing charges against six individuals who authorities say defrauded the state of millions in various schemes, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson said he believed “a significant amount” of the $18 billion paid out by 14 “high-risk” Medicaid-funded programs since 2018 was lost to fraud — possibly half or more.\n\nThe governor has made efforts to address the fraud. Last year, he directed the creation of a fraud investigation unit at the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.\n\nAnd, the Department of Human Services moved to shut down a Medicaid-funded housing stabilization program beset by fraud after news emerged in July of a federal investigation into several providers. Walz also recently named Tim O’Malley, former superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension under Gov. Tim Pawlenty, to serve as director of program integrity, essentially fraud-prevention czar.\n\nBut the moves haven’t stemmed the criticism, particularly from the GOP, that he reacted too late and hasn’t done enough on the issue.","summary":"Walz, a Democrat, got involved in politics during the 2004 John Kerry presidential campaign.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2026/01/05/tim-walzs-decision-not-to-seek-3rd-term-may-end-lengthy-mn-political-career/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/walz20170327.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 19:52:04","author":"Pioneer Press","authors":["Pioneer Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.333},{"id":391498108,"title":"Gov. Tim Walz drops reelection bid, Klobuchar may run instead","text":"ST. PAUL, Minn. >> Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota said today that he was abandoning his bid for reelection to a third term. And Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Democrat, is considering seeking the office, two people briefed on conversations between the two politicians said.\n\nWalz and Klobuchar met Sunday in Minnesota, where he informed her of his plans, and she confirmed her interest in running to succeed him. For Walz, the Democratic nominee for vice president in the 2024 election, the departure caps a brief rise in national politics.\n\nWalz said a widening scandal over fraud in social services programs in Minnesota had persuaded him to drop out of the race. He had been criticized for his administration’s oversight of the programs and its failure to prevent widespread fraud.\n\n“I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,” Walz said in a statement he read aloud during a news conference today. “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.”\n\nKlobuchar did not respond to requests for comment this morning.\n\nWalz’s decision jolts a race that had drawn an unusually large and strong slate of Republican candidates, including the speaker of the Minnesota House, Lisa Demuth, and Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow and an ally of President Donald Trump. Republicans have not won a statewide race in Minnesota since 2006, but they have expressed confidence that this year’s governor’s race would be different.\n\nDemocrats in the state had voiced concern in recent weeks that Walz’s presence on the ticket might hurt other Democrats in November.\n\nWalz’s exit comes amid national scrutiny of his handling of the welfare fraud scandal, which Trump and other top Republicans have assailed him for in recent weeks.\n\nA former public school teacher who served in Congress for 12 years before becoming governor, Walz, 61, had signaled ambivalence last year about seeking a third term. During the summer, shortly before announcing he would run again, the governor said in an interview that he had been trying to gauge whether Minnesotans wanted him to stay in office.\n\n“I think you need to think through: Well, do you have the ability to do the job? Have you done well?” Walz said, describing questions he was wrestling with.\n\nIn September, Walz announced that he did intend to run again. At the time, he said he was proud of a legacy that included passing numerous bills that pushed the state to the left in 2023, when Democrats had majorities in both chambers of the state Legislature.\n\nSoon after that announcement, the fraud scandal began dogging his candidacy.\n\nLater that month, federal prosecutors announced that an investigation into fraud in a COVID-19 program meant to feed children had broadened to include other safety net programs administered by Walz’s administration. Federal prosecutors have asserted that as much as $9 billion may have been stolen over a period of years when Walz’s administration was overseeing state programs.\n\nMore than 90 people have been charged with felonies in the federal fraud cases to date and at least 60 have been convicted. The vast majority of defendants are of Somali origin.\n\nRepublicans accused Walz and fellow Democrats of failing to respond forcefully to red flags about theft in state-run programs in part because Somali Americans are an influential voting bloc for Democrats.\n\nWalz has called that accusation baseless but has acknowledged that fraud had become a pervasive problem in the state, and he announced a series of measures to improve oversight.\n\nAs the scandal continued to make national headlines, providing Republicans a powerful line of attack, Democrats began expressing worry that the scandal would hobble Walz’s campaign.\n\nThe leading Republicans running for governor have made combating fraud their signature issue.\n\n“Even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis,” Walz said in the statement announcing he was dropping out.\n\nThe Trump administration has repeatedly focused on the fraud scandal and threatened to cut funding for Minnesota safety net programs, arguing that Democrats in the state could not be trusted to prevent taxpayer funds from being stolen.\n\nOver the weekend, the White House announced that the Department of Justice was sending additional personnel and resources to Minnesota to “crush Minnesota’s fraud epidemic.”\n\n“These complex criminal networks didn’t build themselves overnight on Tim Walz’s watch, and rooting them out completely requires thorough, methodical work to build cases that secure convictions and recover taxpayer dollars,” a statement from the White House said.\n\nInterest in the fraud scandal grew in the past week, following a viral video created by Nick Shirley, a conservative content creator. In the video, Shirley purported to have exposed rampant fraud in government-subsidized day care centers run by Somalis in the Minneapolis area.\n\nThe video — which did not conclusively prove malfeasance — drew praise from top officials in the Trump administration and Minnesota Republicans.\n\nRepublicans today in the state suggested that they would continue to focus on the fraud issue even with Walz out of the race.\n\n“Minnesota’s fraud epidemic extends well beyond any one individual,” said Harry Niska, a Republican state representative. “It is the result of nearly two decades of Democrat governors, backed by their legislative allies, creating a culture of complacency that has cost Minnesotans and their families billions of dollars.”\n\nKlobuchar, 65, a former state prosecutor, has long held ambitions beyond her Senate seat. She ran in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary and has not given up her desire to hold executive office.\n\nShe has won each of her four Senate terms by at least 16 percentage points in a state that Democrats have controlled for more than a decade but often has close statewide elections. Should Klobuchar become the governor, she would appoint her own replacement who would serve until a special election is held to complete the remainder of her term, which ends in 2030.\n\nShortly after Walz announced he was suspending his campaign, Klobuchar praised him in a statement that did not shed light on her own plans.\n\n“Governor Walz made the difficult decision to focus on his job and the challenges facing our state rather than campaigning and running for reelection,” Klobuchar said. “He has always dedicated his career to delivering for Minnesota.”\n\nFor Walz, the decision to forgo a third term puts a cap on a rapid rise from being a little-known Midwestern governor to his party’s vice-presidential nominee to someone mentioned as a potential top presidential candidate on his own.\n\nWalz spent years carefully building his profile behind the scenes before he emerged as a potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris before she chose him last summer. But his turn on the national stage quickly turned rocky.\n\nQuestions emerged about inconsistencies in his personal biography. Democrats panned his debate performance, and Harris wrote in her campaign memoir that he wasn’t her first choice.\n\nHis supporters today said the governor’s decision exemplified Walz’s dedication to the state. Ken Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said, “Today’s decision is entirely consistent with who Tim is.”\n\nMartin, who is from Minnesota and formerly served as the chair of the state party, added, “Tim has always believed that leadership isn’t about preserving your own power — it’s about using it to make a difference for as many people as possible.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2026 The New York Times Company","summary":"ST.

His wife is a general pediatrician at a St. Elizabeth Physicians primary care facility in Kentucky.\n\nThe DeFoor family appears close with both William and Catherine having just last year paid visits to their youngest children's universities, social media posts show.\n\nThe accused home attacker does not appear to have graduated from a traditional four-year university despite having excelled as a high schooler at The Summit Country Day School, a prestigious private school in Cincinnati.\n\nDeFoor, then known as Davis, graduated in 2018 after being named a National AP Scholar. He was also active in the school's drama department and even played the piano for a musical written, produced and directed by a friend.\n\nThe suspect appears to have created a Facebook page reflecting his new identity - transgender woman Julia DeFoor - just last month.\n\nDeFoor's first profile picture was posted on December 15, but overall the account offers few details about the alleged home invader. \n\nThe profile highlights DeFoor's graduation from Summit Country Day in 2018 and attendance at the University of Cincinnati's College-Conservatory of Music beginning in August that year.\n\nAccording to the profile, DeFoor left the music conservatory in 2020, suggesting that a degree was never completed. His 19-year-old brother Alex, an aspiring musician who shares his songs on social media, currently studies at that very conservatory.\n\nDeFoor then enrolled at Cincinnati State Technical and Community College last year. It is unclear what he was studying.\n\nThe Facebook profile also highlighted his liked pages, including the Heartland Trans Wellness center which aims to provide resources for transgender patients in the Greater Cincinnati area.\n\nHis father William has supported a slew of Democratic causes, including donating more than $11,600 to Kamala Harris's campaign and the Democratic Party political action committee ActBlue in the lead up to the 2024 election.\n\nHe also donated to Joe Biden's presidential campaign in 2020, according to Federal Election Commission records reviewed by the Daily Mail. \n\nDeFoor is a registered Ohio voter, although a party affiliation was not publicly available. He appears to have last voted in the 2020 election. \n\nIt is unclear how close DeFoor is with his parents, despite his last known address being the family home.\n\nWilliam has not recently posted photos with his eldest child.\n\nThe pediatric urologist and Harvard University alumnus shared snaps online of his visit to Alex's university last fall, a European vacation with his wife, and photos from artist Libby's graduation from the University of Iowa in May last year. \n\nBut noticeably absent from William's publicly accessible social media pages was his eldest child.\n\nDeFoor is accused of attacking Vance's home in Cincinnati's East Walnut Hills neighborhood, located roughly 3.5 miles from the DeFoor family home.\n\nSecret Service agents heard a loud noise at the home around midnight and spotted the suspect running from the home, which is the secondary residence for Vance, his wife Usha and their three young children.\n\nDeFoor was detained by agents shortly after, a Secret Service spokesman told the Daily Mail. He was then taken into custody by the Cincinnati Police Department. \n\nThe vice president and his family were out of town at the time of the attack.\n\nWhen an officer informed the suspect of his rights, DeFoor responded: 'I don't know,' according to the arrest report.\n\nHe had also allegedly vandalized a Secret Service vehicle on his way up the home's driveway. \n\nNo motive has been released.\n\nDeFoor has been accused of trashing property before.\n\nHe pleaded guilty in April to two counts of vandalism after causing more than $2,000 worth of damage to an interior design company, court records show.\n\nHe was sentenced to treatment at a mental health facility for two years and was required to pay $5,550 in damages.\n\nDeFoor is set to be arraigned at Hamilton County Municipal Court on Tuesday.\n\nThe Daily Mail's calls to the DeFoor family went unanswered. \n\nFollowing the break-in, footage was released showing large holes in the windows of Vance's home as cops patrolled the scene and recorded evidence of the damage.\n\nThe luxurious East Walnut Hills property overlooks the Ohio River and spans 2.3 acres. The Vance family purchased the home for $1.4 million.\n\nAfter taking the vice presidential oath of office in January 2025, Vance and his wife Usha have lived with their three children at the Naval Observatory in Washington, DC.\n\nThe couple also own a property on Capitol Hill.\n\nVance posted on X: 'I appreciate everyone's well wishes about the attack at our home. As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows.

Good Riddance.","text":"With dark clouds gathering over his previously sunny reelection bid, Tim Walz has had enough. Minnesota's Democratic governor announced Monday he would abandon his pursuit of a third term following widespread negative publicity due to his mishandling of welfare fraud allegations.\n\nWalz has not been accused of personal wrongdoing, but the buck stops here, as they say. Walz was the man in charge while fraudsters stole millions, or perhaps billions, of taxpayer dollars by setting up fake charities, ransacking the medical system, and operating dubious child care services. The sheer amount of plunder has attracted national media attention in recent weeks, with even The New York Times throwing Walz under the bus.\n\nThe governor's response has not reassured his critics that he is laser focused on restoring credibility to these programs and mercilessly prosecuting thieves. It is fine to insist, as Walz has, that the entire Somali diaspora not be smeared for the criminal behavior of some community members, but the governor has made a habit of trying to redirect blame to other groups, such as white men. This is unpersuasive, since the accusations against the Somalis are about proportionality, not absolute levels of crime. Moreover, saying that we must be color-blind with respect to the ethnicities of the fraudsters while also calling for more white men to be held accountable is totally incoherent.\n\nUnfortunately, this incoherence is broadly representative of the Walz persona. This is a man who was elevated to national prominence by Vice President Kamala Harris when she picked him to be her 2025 running mate. In Walz's own clumsily-worded telling, she picked him because he could \"code talk to white guys\" like himself. He saw his job as reassuring his own identity group that they could vote for a black woman for president. It's a reductive and extremely flawed notion of what makes for a relatable presidential ticket; Harris underperformed with men—particularly young men—of all racial backgrounds, not specifically white guys. Walz likes football and fixing trucks, so vote Harris/Walz 2024! This is identity politics at its most vacuous.\n\nBut it's not just that Walz's vibes are off. His governance in the state of Minnesota has been disastrous, even apart from the fraud scandal. Indeed, Walz has achieved a record as hostile to human liberty as virtually any other currently seated governor. He was, first and foremost, a COVID-19 tyrant who zealously enforced social distancing and mask requirements, including by setting up a coronavirus snitch hotline: Citizens were encouraged to report their neighbors to the government for failing to abide by COVID-19 rules. He also spent coronavirus relief money on pet projects and political kickbacks that were obviously outside the scope of what the money ought to have been used for: state workers' parking costs, teaching women and minority owned businesses how to apply for state contracts, and the Minneapolis zoo.\n\nFor supporters of individual liberty, Walz's various pronouncements on policy issues were like nails on a chalkboard. He said that misinformation was not protected by the First Amendment. (It is.) He said socialism was just \"neighborliness.\" (He should take that attitude to New York City, where it belongs, unfortunately.) He said it was \"not a mistake\" to send sick COVID-19 patients back to nursing homes. (Even former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has dropped that point.)\n\nA year ago, Walz was seen as a potential 2028 vice presidential candidate. His decision not to run for reelection—an explicit acknowledgement of the toll the fraud scandal has taken on his reputation—seems like the end for Walz's political career. At least he will have plenty of time for football and trucks.","summary":"Once a 2028 hopeful, the Minnesota Democrat is one of the most unlibertarian governors in the country.","url":"https://reason.com/2026/01/05/tim-walz-drops-out-of-minnesota-governor-race-good-riddance/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/1-5-26-v1-a-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 19:10:16","author":"Jacob Sullum,Robby Soave","authors":["Jacob Sullum","Robby Soave"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":391485784,"title":"Walz, Democrats’ 2024 VP pick, drops bid for third term as Minnesota governor; Klobuchar considers","text":"Around a dozen Republicans are already running.

As a critique of moral panic, this book is unsuccessful; as a symptom of moral panic, it is exemplary.\n\nThis is unfortunate, because Szetela’s subject warrants thoughtful consideration and criticism. \n\nThe left can engage in misguided moral panics and futile cultural warfare, degrading the potential of its political project. The tendency of some artists, writers, readers, critics and academics to participate in swarming social media condemnations of fellow progressives they believe to have morally transgressed can be unsettling and harmful. \n\nAnd the corporate hypocrisy of large publishers loudly proclaiming the value of representing diverse voices while prioritising profit over people, and publishing conservative authors who ridicule diversity initiatives, deserves attention.\n\nSzetela considers all these issues, but his claims are repeatedly undermined by his habits of argument, style and conjecture.\n\nLaying the groundwork for the unfurling of his various verdicts, Szetela admiringly quotes James Carville’s exclamation that, “Wokeness is a problem and we all know it.” (Carville, a former Bill Clinton advisor, has a patchy record when it comes to diagnosis, having written in October 2024 that “Ms. [Kamala] Harris will be elected the next president of the United States. Of this, I am certain.”)\n\nThat Book Is Dangerous! sits squarely within the recent tradition of literature anxious about cancel culture as a central social and political challenge.\n\nThose making this kind of argument often exaggerate the stakes of the crisis in order to justify their political urgency. Yet they fail to properly contextualise it against the usually more successful conservative campaigns to determine the battlefields where contemporary culture wars are fought. \n\nSzetela preempts this criticism, but unconvincingly, writing:\n\nAt a moment when people are focused on the right’s moral panic over literature, it might seem strange that this book focuses on the left’s moral panic over literature. After all, right-wing panic has had more influence at the legislative level. That is true. But left-wing panic has had significantly more influence inside publishers, agencies, and other corners of literary culture.\n\nSpeculative, outsized assertions\n\nThere are numerous problems with this defence. First, the campaigns of both sides are most usefully discussed in relation to one another, because each reacts to the other as an existential threat. A more worthwhile book would compare the duelling political forces, assessing the reality of the problems to which they are responding. \n\nSecond, as Szetela openly admits, the US publishing industry does indeed have a diversity problem and what he describes as a “left-wing panic” is often an authentic response to this problem.\n\nSzetela cites a Publishers Weekly study that found 84% of publishing professionals are white and concedes \n\njust 15 percent of books that made recent New York Times YA bestseller lists included main characters of colour. Even fewer books included LGBTQ+ characters and characters with disabilities.\n\nThis lack of representation is exacerbated by book-banning efforts led by Republican-governed states. In February, The Guardian noted that Florida, for instance, “has by far the highest number of book bans in the past year, with 4,561 instances of banned books across 33 school districts”. Banned titles include Toni Morrison’s Pulitzer prizewinning novel Beloved, an extraordinary story of the profound trauma inflicted by slavery and racist violence in 19th century America. \n\nTo substantiate his thesis, Szetela frequently draws conclusions that do not follow from the provided evidence. This pattern renders otherwise interesting observations inert.\n\nHe asks the reader to consider how disastrous it would have been if “Martin Luther King Jr. believed that literature written for young people was one of the best places to oppose racism in the United States.”\n\n“Fortunately,” he writes “civil rights leaders devoted their time, money, and other resources to a political movement, rather than a popular culture crusade.”\n\nThis is an essentialising argument requiring us to accept that those advocating for more sensitive literary portrayals of marginalised communities imagine themselves to be fighting on the front line of the battle against racism. Some no doubt believe this, but Szetela provides no compelling evidence the delusion is general.\n\nHistrionic quoting\n\nHe does proffer the examples of Amélie Wen Zhao’s Blood Heir and Keira Drake’s The Continent – YA fantasy novels that were lambasted on social media for being racist. \n\nZhao’s novel received backlash on Twitter (now X) and Goodreads regarding the book’s depiction of slavery, with critics claiming it appropriated and erased African American history. Drake’s novel was criticised for using racist tropes in her depiction of the story’s fictitious, warring tribes. Both books were withdrawn, edited, and republished, the new editions failing to acknowledge the rewriting. \n\nAgain, this is a controversy worth examining, but its significance is undercut by Szetela’s histrionic quoting of Orwell:\n\nWhat Orwell said of Oceania [in 1984] is just as true of the Sensitivity Era: ‘Books, also, were recalled and rewritten again and again, and were invariably reissued without any admission that any alteration had been made’. \n\nSzetela has not provided an example of government-ordered political censorship kept secret from citizens, but a widely analysed phenomenon, frequently remarked upon by all involved.\n\nYet to make his point seem more powerful, Szetela invokes cliché with the tone of a teenager telling horror stories in a walk-in closet, his face lit with a torch to amplify the spookiness. This kind of speculative, out-sized assertion is typical of the book. Its most frequent touch points are, uncreatively, George Orwell’s 1984, the Salem witch trials, and Ray Bradbury’s Fahrenheit 451, a 1953 dystopian novel with a fireman protagonist tasked with burning banned books.\n\nFollowing in the footsteps of anti-woke campaigners such as Jonathan Haidt, author of The Anxious Generation, and linguist John McWhorter, author of Woke Racism (both of whom Szetela quotes extensively), Szetela suggests college campuses have provided the blueprint for the Sensitivity Era. \n\nAgain, there are practical questions to be asked about the value of trigger warnings and how universities should diversify reading lists while continuing to teach the classics, but Szetela does not ask them.\n\nTypical of his obfuscation is the example of Bright Sheng, a University of Michigan professor who was “removed from his course after he screened an adaptation of William Shakespeare’s Othello.” Sheng apologised, and was “accused of further insensitivities”.\n\nSzetela compares the students who complained about Sheng to adherents to a genocidal dictatorship:\n\nWhen students are revered for reporting their professors, it is hard not to be reminded of China as well as the Soviet Union. Under Stalin, ‘every schoolchild had to learn the story of the boy Pavlik Morozov, who was celebrated for turning in his parents for holding anti-Soviet attitudes.’\n\nWhat Szetela fails to mention is that Sheng was removed from his course because he showed a version of Othello starring Laurence Olivier in blackface, about which Sheng had failed to warn his students. \n\nSzetela also doesn’t mention that Sheng continues to work at the University of Michigan. One could debate whether Sheng’s transgression deserved dismissal, but to omit such crucial details is reason enough to question Szetela’s credibility as a reliable source of examples.\n\nThe triumph of rhetoric\n\nWhile Szetela’s background is in literary studies, his arguments are shaped by the disciplines of social psychology and sociology. A habit of these fields is dividing our behaviour into narrow explanatory categories. The mind is thus comprehended as essentially robotic in nature, with actions attributable to common group dynamics rather than sophisticated inner lives.\n\nA danger of this habit is that instead of using analysis as a jumping off point from which to consider the distinct nuances of specific experience, it writes off individuals as unknowingly irrational agents, vulnerable to the whims of their social conditioning. The method makes for excellent rhetoric but impoverished philosophy.\n\nSzetela deploys many such categories including “virtue hoarding” and “moral entrepreneurs” (those who undertake a moral crusade purely to increase their status). He even coins his own: “militant fragility” – to condemn the conduct of his subjects. \n\nThis is not to say that, for example, moral entrepreneurs do not exist. Rather, that the application of this label, instead of provoking questions about the potential complexity of a person’s motivations, dispenses with the need for further inquiry. This kind of argument is especially effective if a scholar’s goal is to render their subject’s position absurd.\n\nSzetela gives the game away when he describes social scientists and psychologists as “more serious researchers” than literary critics. \n\nHe cites a Princeton psychologist and political scientist who evaluated nearly 1,000 studies aiming to identify how prejudice is reduced, pointing out that “no intervention examined ‘the effect of literature on prejudice among general audiences.’”\n\nTherefore, he concludes, we should spend our time “addressing the economic conditions” proven to increase prejudice.\n\nBut why must the pursuit of economic justice come at the cost of advocating for diversity in literature? And why dismiss the obvious social and cultural significance of literature simply because it resists being encapsulated by the extremely limited conceptual tools of empirical studies in the social sciences?\n\nThe accusation that literary studies is unserious seems to depend on its failure to rely on quantitative data from which conclusions can be drawn. Yet the quantitative data Szetela does use often has no bearing on his conclusions whatsoever. \n\nFor example, Szetela crows over the fact that Quillette, a vocally anti-woke online publication, has more Twitter followers (the book never acknowledges Elon Musk’s role in transforming or renaming the platform) than left-wing outlets such as The New Republic or The Baffler, as if this alone signals greater influence or quality. \n\nElsewhere, he derides two books on race and American literature as being irrelevant due to their lack of Amazon reviews. (At the time of writing, Szetela’s book had only 13, which, by his own metric, is hardly a sign of excellence.)\n\nEspecially outrageous is his use of data to criticise sensitivity reader’s pay rates. Sensitivity readers – specialist editors who read manuscripts to evaluate the representation of a particular marginalised group – are perhaps this book’s most frequent target. Szetela takes issue with this relatively new profession for having “eroded the idea that expertise is something a person attains, rather than something a person self-declares.”\n\n Read more:\n Friday essay: I work as a sensitivity reader – and racism is harder to spot than you'd think\n\nBut a potentially productive critique is once again ruined by feeble analysis. Extrapolating from data he proffers showing sensitivity readers charge between half a cent to one cent per word, he calculates that a sensitivity reader reading 250 words an hour for 40 hours a week would earn between US$156,000 (A$233,250) and US$312,000 (A$464,493) per year. This is ridiculous and unscholarly. \n\nAs any freelancer proximate to the publishing industry knows, maintaining 40 hours a week of consistent work across a year (without taking a single holiday, per Szetela’s calculations) is unheard of. Additionally, Szetela’s unjustly monied sensitivity reader only reads, having no time for selling their services, note-taking, or providing the actual feedback.\n\nLess than generous\n\nThis discrediting hyperbole is in keeping with Szetela’s authorial voice throughout, which is sometimes gleefully sneering, adopting the least generous reading of its subjects.\n\nDescribing staff at Penguin Random House trying to stop their employer from publishing Jordan Peterson’s Beyond Order: 12 More Rules For Life, Szetela reports that, “In a meeting, some of these adults cried.” In the acknowledgements section of his book, he takes another needless swipe at these people who became emotional in their workplace. \n\nAttributing his own resilience, oddly, to his history of wrestling injuries (including “wrestling with concussions”), he proudly pronounces he \n\ncan’t imagine a situation in which I would break down crying, like the employees at Penguin Random House, because somebody wrote a book that I’m not interested in reading.\n\nSzetela’s book is punctuated by telling, unnecessary snark. For instance, he needlessly describes a trans professor he admires as someone who “does not ‘police’ what people call him”, as if trans people who prefer to be known by their actual name are simply excessively precious victims of his Sensitivity Era.\n\nHe is right to point out that if we reduce literature to questions of representation we risk abandoning the irreducible moral and aesthetic complexity reading makes possible. \n\nHe is right to recognise that social media and the sometimes hysterical rhetoric it fosters can have an out-sized influence on decisions across the publishing industry. And he is right that identity politics should not be the exclusive frame through which to judge literary value.\n\nIt is also the case that in 2026, literary culture is threatened by, among other things, corporate monopolies, falling literacy rates, artificial intelligence, actual government censorship, the gutting of humanities departments, and austerity across the publishing sector. Szetela nods to many of these challenges, but does not satisfactorily account for them.\n\nArt cannot account for every individual response and sometimes it will hurt people. Yet we all expect art to be sensitive to its audience. We just struggle to reach consensus about what constitutes an acceptable level of sensitivity. By declaring that we inhabit the Sensitivity Era, Szetela raises the non-trivial question of how we should reach this consensus.\n\nA thoughtful examination of this issue would recognise the complexity and variety of what we want from literature. It would acknowledge, too, that our judgement depends on an intricate patchwork of aesthetic and ethical values differing from person to person. This book lacks the intellectual self-awareness and moral rigour to do so.","summary":"In That Book is Dangerous! author Adam Szetela argues we exist in a ‘Sensitivity Era’ and publishing is paying the price.

They are, naturally, both very, very happy.'\n\nThe couple met on Instagram in 2016, but despite their careers being heavily focused on social media, they have chosen to keep their romance largely out of the public eye.\n\nBy his own admission, Steven struggled to maintain a healthy relationship with Melanie in their early days while pursuing his business ambitions, a challenge he discussed during one of his live podcast shows in 2022. \n\nHe previously said: 'The way it is with me, between the hours of say seven in the morning and nine o' clock at night, I am in the zone, I've got total tunnel vision.\n\n'I honestly do not realise that there's anyone else outside of my business and rooms I sit in that exists in terms of my personal and private life.\n\n'So if my family or girlfriend text me, or message me during the day, the chances of me engaging in that meaningfully in that period is virtually impossible.\n\n'In the evenings I'm often consumed with the day and I find it hard to switch off and engage with other relationships and that also costs those relationships.'\n\nBut after learning to maintain a healthy work-life balance, Steven and Melanie rekindled their romance and have since travelled the world together, all while supporting each other's careers. \n\nSteven is best known as the host of The Diary of a CEO podcast, which regularly tops the UK charts and attracts millions of streams each month thanks to its engaging interviews and A-list guests.\n\nSince launching in 2017, Steven has interviewed a wide range of high-profile figures, from Kamala Harris to Louis Tomlinson, Davina McCall, Lewis Capaldi, and Simon Cowell.\n\nHe is also the youngest Dragon on BBC's Dragons' Den, appearing alongside Peter Jones and Deborah Meaden, and is regularly seen investing in new and emerging business ventures. \n\nSteven, who moved to the UK from Botswana at the age of two, dropped out of university at 18 to pursue his ambitions as a businessman.\n\nHe fell out with his parents, particularly his mother, who was 'heartbroken' after believing Steven had thrown away the education she never had growing up.\n\nHowever, Steven found success with his social media marketing agency, The Social Chain, which was valued at £300million when it first entered the stock market.\n\nHe is set for a busy year; alongside wedding planning, Steven will return to the upcoming series of Dragons' Den and continue recording his podcast, one of the most successful in the world.\n\nIn October last year, his company Steven.com, which houses his media ventures, including the firm Flight Story, was valued at £320million.\n\nSteven has said this will help him 'build the Disney of the creator economy,' referring to the multi-billion-pound industry of influencers who make a living through streaming and posting on TikTok, Instagram, Twitch, and YouTube.","summary":"Steven Bartlett is engaged to marry his long-term girlfriend Melanie Lopes, the Daily Mail can exclusively reveal.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15435483/steven-bartlett-engaged-diary-ceo-podcaster-dragons-den-star-marry-girlfriend-melanie-lopes.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/01/05/14/105243863-0-image-m-16_1767622866978.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2023/08/16/3952233012764127995/1024x576_MP4_3952233012764127995.mp4","publish_date":"2026-01-05 18:59:10","author":"Editor,Sarah Packer","authors":["Editor","Sarah Packer"],"language":"en","source_country":"GB","sentiment":0.43},{"id":391493178,"title":"Kamala Harris Called Trump’s Venezuelan Operation 'Unlawful and Unwise.'

He was viewed as a moderate Democrat who supported gun rights and was elected to the House of Representatives six times before leaving to run for governor in 2018. \n\nDuring that campaign, Walz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters due to his folksy charm, and his attack line against Trump and his running mate, JD Vance — \"These guys are just weird\" — spread widely. But he drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.\n\nDefends Somali community from Trump attacks\n\nThrough nearly two terms as governor, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nAfter the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020, Walz pleaded for calm but also stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence. \n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. \n\nMinnesota eliminated nearly all of the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youth and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Walz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nBut he has been plagued by a $300-million US pandemic food fraud scheme revolving around the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, for which 57 defendants in Minnesota have been convicted. \n\nMost of those defendants were Somali American, but Walz and other Democrats have criticized Trump and his allies for statements that appeared to blame the entire diaspora for actions committed by just dozens of people.\n\nThe Minneapolis-St. Paul area is home to about 84, 000 residents of Somali descent, and the Trump administration's efforts to deport unauthorized American residents have included operations in the state.\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin, another Minnesotan, said Monday that Walz \"entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.\" \n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokesperson Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for \"failed leadership\" and argued that the eventual Democratic nominee \"will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.\"\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running in the party's primary to determine a gubernatorial candidate.

Both Walz and Hortman's children condemned the post and urged him to take it down.\n\n\"Dangerous, depraved behaviour from the sitting president of the United States,\" Walz said in his own social media post in response. \"In covering for an actual serial killer, he is going to get more innocent people killed.\"\n\nFrom high school to politics\n\nHarris picked Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election, citing his history across a range of experiences in advocating for working families.\n\nWalz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Neb., was a social studies teacher and high school football coach before he got into politics. He also served in the U.S. national guard for 24 years.\n\nWalz flipped a Republican seat in rural Minnesota in 2006 to represent the state in U.S. Congress. He was viewed as a moderate Democrat who supported gun rights and was elected to the House of Representatives six times before leaving to run for governor in 2018. \n\nDuring that campaign, Walz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters due to his folksy charm, and his attack line against Trump and his running mate, JD Vance — \"These guys are just weird\" — spread widely. But he drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.\n\nDefends Somali community from Trump attacks\n\nThrough nearly two terms as governor, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nAfter the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020, Walz pleaded for calm but also stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence. \n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. \n\nMinnesota eliminated nearly all of the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youth and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Walz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nBut he has been plagued by a $300-million US pandemic food fraud scheme revolving around the nonprofit Feeding Our Future, for which 57 defendants in Minnesota have been convicted. \n\nMost of those defendants were Somali American, but Walz and other Democrats have criticized Trump and his allies for statements that appeared to blame the entire diaspora for actions committed by just dozens of people.\n\nThe Minneapolis-St. Paul area is home to about 84, 000 residents of Somali descent, and the Trump administration's efforts to deport unauthorized American residents have included operations in the state.\n\nDemocratic National Committee chairman Ken Martin, another Minnesotan, said Monday that Walz \"entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.\" \n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokesperson Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for \"failed leadership\" and argued that the eventual Democratic nominee \"will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.\"\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running in the party's primary to determine a gubernatorial candidate. The list includes a number of current and former state legislators, as well as MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, a 2020 election denier who is close to Trump. \n\nA total of 36 states hold gubernatorial elections in 2026, a midterm election year.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

Tim Walz’s decision to not pursue re-election but doubled down on demands for accountability. \"Governor Walz's decision to not seek re-election is the only acceptable outcome after the large-scale fraud that was permitted under his watch,\" Rep. Michelle Fischbach, R-Minn., said. Fischbach, a member of the powerful House Rules Committee, previously served as lieutenant governor of the North Star State in 2018. NICK SHIRLEY GLOATS HE 'ENDED TIM WALZ’ AFTER MINNESOTA GOVERNOR SCRAPS RE-ELECTION BID AMID FRAUD SCANDAL \"His career is ending because Walz and the Democrats allowed Minnesota to become a national playground for fraudsters, and his radical negligence has cost Minnesotans billions,\" Fischbach said. Minnesota first elected Walz as governor in 2018 and then re-elected him in 2022. Walz ran briefly for the White House as a part of Vice President Kamala Harris’ ticket in 2024, but, after he was unsuccessful, announced plans to pursue a third term as governor. His decision to drop out of that race comes as new revelations about fraud in Minnesota show the state could have lost as much as $9 billion under Walz’s leadership through abuse of its government assistance programs. DAVID MARCUS: TIM WALZ'S WHITE GUILT FINALLY ENDS HIS CAREER AS MINNESOTA’S FRAUD EXPLODES In recent months, investigators have discovered sweeping fraud schemes masquerading as daycare centers, medical providers, food assistance programs and more. By fabricating services or misrepresenting the number of people they claimed to serve, the schemes siphoned billions in government funds. Walz’s current term ends in January 2027. Rep. Pete Stauber, R-Minn., believes it should end sooner. \"Governor Walz's decision not to seek re-election doesn't let him off the hook,\" Stauber said. \"Minnesotans deserve to see full accountability. Under Tim Walz’s leadership, at least $9 billion was stolen from taxpayers by fraudsters, the state’s $18 billion surplus was squandered, taxes were increased by $10 billion and illegal immigrants were given free college, health care and driver’s licenses.\" \"If Walz is unfit to seek re-election, he is unfit to serve as governor. The news this morning should have been ‘Tim Walz resigns,’\" Stauber added. COMER WARNS WALZ ABSENCE AT MINNESOTA FRAUD HEARING WOULD BE 'ADMISSION TO GUILT' BY GOVERNOR With an eye toward the future, Rep. Brad Finstad, R-Minn., lamented that the fraud rings in Minnesota would take time to unwind and that the state would have a long road ahead toward healing. \"Unfortunately, it will take years to undo the damage he has done to the state of Minnesota. The next Governor of Minnesota will have a massive task ahead of them to root out systemic waste, fraud and abuse. I am committed to working with my fellow Minnesotans to ensure we elect a Republican governor who will restore trust in state government and the reputation of our great state,\" Finstad said in a post to X. Despite Walz’s announcement, Fischbach said that Republican efforts to investigate fraud and abuse in Minnesota would continue.

(RELATED: Jimmy Kimmel Credits Donald Trump In Acceptance Speech)\n\nIn contrast, 44% of Harris voters reported “never” attending church, with another 21% reporting “seldom” attendance at religious services.\n\n“For every Harris voter who attended church weekly in 2024, there were about four Harris voters who attended less than once a year,” Burge summarized. “If that’s not the God gap, I don’t know what is.”\n\nHowever, Democrats and Republicans are both more removed from religious services than ever, according to the data.\n\nSince 2008, the percentage of Republicans reporting at least yearly attendance at a religious service has dropped from 71% to 57%, with most of the difference attributed to an 11-point increase in those who “never” attend religious services and a 7-point decline in those who attend a religious service more than once a week.\n\n“The other thing worth noting is that the share of Republican voters who attend weekly hasn’t really changed much; it’s the more-than-once-a-week people who have started to disappear,” Burge said, pointing out that Republicans are twice as likely to not go to church at present than in 2008.\n\nAlthough GOP religiosity is at an all-time low, the “God gap” between the parties has never been greater.\n\nIn 2008, only 24% of Democrats “never” attended church, but that figure rose to 44% in 2024, with sharp declines in all other categories of religious service attendance.\n\n Here’s the God Gap in one graph. The share of Republicans who expressed an atheist/agnostic belief in God was 4% in 1988. It was 4% in 2024. For Democrats, that share went from 5% to 23% during the same time period. pic.twitter.com/z2IB5eTF9T — Ryan Burge 📊 (@ryanburge) January 3, 2026\n\nBurge also broke down the Cooperative Election Study’s reported religious makeup of the parties.\n\nSince 2008, the Republican Party has seen a slight drop in support from mainline Christians, white Catholics and Latter-day Saints. During the same time frame, the party has gained increased support from white and nonwhite evangelicals, Black Protestants, Orthodox Christians, Jews, atheists, agnostics and those identifying as “nothing in particular.”\n\nBurge found that 42% of Trump’s votes came from the evangelical community. There is no more important voting bloc in the country than evangelicals if you are Republican. It’s basically impossible to win any race without their support,” he wrote.\n\n“The only other group that really registers much at all are the ‘nothing in particular’ people,” Burge continued, citing that category’s growth in GOP representation from 8% to 12%.\n\nAtheists and agnostics now make up only 5% of all GOP voters, with approximately 80% of Trump voters being Christian.\n\n“To be even more specific, 70% came from white Christians,” Burge said. “The GOP is the party of white Christianity.”\n\nSince 2008, the Democratic Party has lost support from white evangelicals, mainline Christians and Catholics. The party has received a small increase in support from nonwhite evangelicals and Jews, with most of its growth coming from those who identify as religious “nones.” (RELATED: ‘Murder Masquerading As Medicine’: Senate Ignores Bill On CCP’s Christian Organ Harvesting)\n\nBurge concluded that the only reason Democrats are not getting “blown out in every election” is due to their support from atheists, agnostics and those who identify as “nones.”\n\n“The GOP vote is 80% Christian and 17% nonreligious. The Democratic vote is 48% Christian and 45% nonreligious,” Burge summarized the current “God Gap,” adding that future elections will go the way of whatever party can “build a slightly bigger coalition without alienating their base.”","summary":"'no more important voting bloc in the country'","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2026/01/05/democrats-republicans-ryan-burge-christians-atheists-trump-kamala-harris-study/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2026%2F01%2FGettyImages-583830018-scaled-e1767631024315.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 17:57:41","author":"Derek Vanbuskirk","authors":["Derek Vanbuskirk"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":391512314,"title":"Corrupt Amy Klobuchar Kickback: Possible Scheme to Appoint Tim Walz to Senate Exposed Early","text":"Flailing Minnesota Gov.

Responding to an Axios report on June 21, 2020, that Trump would consider meeting with Maduro after the despot ignored the disputed election versus opposition leader Juan Guaidó, Biden said, \"Trump talks tough on Venezuela, but admires thugs and dictators like Nicolás Maduro.\" \"As President, I will stand with the Venezuelan people and for democracy,\" Biden added. VENEZUELAN PRESIDENT NICOLAS MADURO’S NARCO CASE ECHOES US HISTORY OF TARGETING ALLEGED FOREIGN DRUG KINGPINS Soon after the weekend operation at Miraflores – the Venezuelan dictator’s official residence – conservatives and at least one left-leaning political activist highlighted how, in the words of several civilian respondents, the comment \"aged like milk.\" \"Whoops,\" remarked Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who is also running for the Yellowhammer State’s governorship this year. \"And now, every Democrat is denouncing an operation to execute a federal warrant while we slept,\" Tuberville said. RUBIO DEFENDS VENEZUELA OPERATION AFTER NBC QUESTIONS LACK OF CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL FOR MADURO CAPTURE The Auburn football legend went on to claim Biden’s comment showed \"Democrats have no principles [and] it’s about whatever way the left wind is blowing to gain power.\" \"Yesterday's margaritas with Kilmar Abrego Garcia is today's Maduro,\" he said. \"They'll support a drug-trafficking dictator because this was another Trump win. Guaranteed.\" The Trump campaign arm’s \"Rapid Response 47\" X account also re-upped Biden’s message, responding with a photograph of Maduro blindfolded on a U.S. government aircraft following his capture. MADURO'S CAPTURE IS 'BEGINNING OF THE END' FOR CUBA'S REGIME, HOUSE INTELLIGENCE CHAIR SAYS \"A tweet that did not age well,\" added Fox News host and former Trump press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. \"Has anyone called to see if Joe is still sleeping?\" remarked Pennsylvania state Rep. Aaron Bernstine, who represents Butler County, where Trump was nearly assassinated in 2024.

Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., added in a statement on social media that Trump \"doesn’t just talk tough, he is tough.\" \"Does Joe Biden have anything to say now?\" she asked, as other critics cited a second Biden comment from that timeframe wherein the Delaware Democrat called Maduro a dictator and criticized his \"human rights violations and extrajudicial killings.\" \"Wait. You mean ‘Don’t’ diplomacy didn’t get it done?\" remarked former NYPD inspector Paul Mauro, who is also a Fox News contributor. TRUMP ISSUES DIRECT WARNING TO VENEZUELA'S NEW LEADER DELCY RODRÍGUEZ FOLLOWING MADURO CAPTURE Mauro had referenced Biden’s widely circulated response to an inquiry about what his message to Iran would be to prevent them from intervening in Israel. \"Don’t,\" Biden replied before leaving the stage where he was speaking at MS-NOW host Al Sharpton’s National Action Network. In 2022, Biden climate envoy John Kerry – a former Massachusetts senator – was videotaped shaking hands and smiling in brief conversation with Maduro at the United Nations’ climate change summit that year in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt. KAMALA HARRIS BLASTS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S CAPTURE OF VENEZUELA’S MADURO AS ‘UNLAWFUL AND UNWISE’ When pressed on the surprisingly jovial greeting, Kerry spokesman Ned Price said the Venezuelan leader had \"interrupted what was an ongoing meeting at COP27\" and called the exchange \"very much an unplanned interaction.\" Other critics pointed out that former President Barack Obama established the first bounty on Maduro’s head in 2015 via executive order, which was increased by the Biden administration, then doubled to $50 million by Trump more recently. \"Joe Biden hated Maduro just as much. He just wasn’t bold enough to get him,\" said Ja’Mal Green, a former Chicago mayoral candidate and community activist who previously aligned with Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., but appeared to sour on some of the far-left’s policies under current Mayor Brandon Johnson and now identifies as \"politically independent.\" TRUMP VOWS US 'IN CHARGE' OF VENEZUELA AS HE REVEALS IF HE'S SPOKEN TO DELCY RODRÍGUEZ \"All [Biden] did was impose sanctions and never get the money owed. Democrats have to stop.\" \"Under Biden, he watched as Maduro slaughtered and oppressed the people of Venezuela. He watched as Maduro lost the election but still declared himself the winner. He then just allowed millions of Venezuelans to come to America to claim refuge, costing us hundreds of billions of dollars,\" said Green, who has also criticized Johnson over Chicago’s response to the illegal immigration crisis. \"Under Trump, Maduro FAFO. He swooped in and took him out of the country altogether,\" Green said. \"Regardless of our disagreements, sometimes diplomacy doesn’t work, and we must use aggression to free a nation.

Like many a petty and stupid man, he likes to puff up his resume, pretend to be more important than he is, and use decibels and large gestures to simulate passion and leadership abilities. \n\nHe is, literally, the assistant coach who tells everybody he coached his team to the big game, or the soldier who bails from deployment while claiming to be a war hero. \n\nYet the career of Tim Walz is, in fact, interesting. Very interesting, actually, since this petty and stupid man nearly rose to the top of the political heap despite having no talent, a dodgy background, and, under scrutiny, a story that stands up as well as a Potemkin village in a blizzard. \n\nAs everybody focuses on Walz's ignominious exit from politics, Americans should pay less attention to the specifics of Walz's career arc and more to the question of why the state and national Democratic Party looked to Walz as a model politician worthy of elevating to the Vice Presidency. \n\nThe scale and scope of the fraud being revealed in Minnesota are yet unknown. However, the former is likely \"tens of billions of dollars\" and the latter is being \"everything not nailed down,\" but one thing is clear. Everybody in Democratic Party circles had to know what was going on, at least at some level. \n\nAfter all, the prosecutions were ongoing for years. Keith Ellison, who was Deputy Chairman of the Democratic National Committee while a Congressman and is now Minnesota Attorney General, was an active player in the Feeding Our Future scandal, and Biden's FBI, which presumably helped vet Walz for his position as Vice Presidential candidate, was the lead investigator on the fraud. \n\nAverage Americans may just be hearing about all this corruption, but among politicos here in Minnesota, the basics were common knowledge. American Experiment, a Minnesota think tank, has been on it for years; Sahel Journal and The Minnesota Reformer, two independent news outlets, have been reporting on the story. The local mainstream \"newspaper\", The Star Tribune (published by a Walz friend and former appointee, of course), has not, which explains why few Minnesotans knew. \n\nI don’t think we fully acknowledged how creepy Gwen Walz was. https://t.co/uGMguvUqmO pic.twitter.com/4amSETyGcu— Jon Gabriel (@exjon) December 31, 2024\n\nWhat makes Walz interesting, then, is that it was he, among all the candidates, that the Democratic Party and Kamala Harris in particular chose as the next Vice President of the United States. \n\nAnybody with half a brain and the wit to think about what this means knows that Tim Walz wasn't picked despite the corruption, but BECAUSE of the corruption. They knew that their pets in Pravda would smother the story with a pillow, as they have for years, and that no enterprising reporters at any of the major networks would do the deep dive to expose the rot. And none of them did, despite having a roadmap provided to them. \n\nInstead, they took this rather unpleasant and vapid man and tried to turn him into an everyman who could \"code talk\" to rural white men. \n\nWhy? It's obvious: fraud is what funds the Democratic Party and its entire political operation. Welfare fraud. Contracting fraud. Small business loan fraud. Insider trading. The big mistake the Democratic Party made was thinking that Walz was any good at it. He never was; he existed as a cipher in a state where the establishment all wanted the grift to go on, and he was enjoying the ride. \n\nIf you want to understand how bad the fraud was in Minnesota, here is a picture of Tim Walz giving an award to one of the convicted Feeding Our Future fraudsters for her fraudulent businesses. pic.twitter.com/J3BSGKDWVe— AG (@AGHamilton29) January 5, 2026\n\nHalf of all Medicaid spending in Minnesota is fraudulent.

Now, Walz has not been accused of any wrongdoing, but it has been a growing political headache.”“Over the holidays, it certainly did widen.” “There was a right wing influencer who posted a viral video on social media that quite literally went viral when the vice president of the United States and the FBI director leaned in on this.”“And it shined a spotlight on what had been some deep concerns among Minnesota Democrats, even about the wisdom of Governor Walz seeking a third term.”“They believe that this would hang over the entire reelection effort and perhaps even damage the Democratic Party.”\n\nBut Minnesota is not the big prize, and it's hard to see how, now that an \"Army of Davids\" has been unleashed to ferret out fraud, other scandals won't break out nationwide. Most will remain unprosecuted if for no other reason than that the sheer scale of so many difficult to prosecute white collar cases is beyond the capacity of even the federal government to follow through on. \n\nBut a lot of damage will be done, and the Trump administration may flood the zone in Blue states, and there may be some more scalps. \n\nKLOBUCHAR LIKELY TO RUN: A source close to Senator Amy Klobuchar tells me this morning “in the event Governor Walz decides not to run” she will likely run for governor, saying she is “getting outreach from people encouraging her to run, and is seriously considering it.\" @kstp pic.twitter.com/VI8t4V3zRw— Tom Hauser (@thauserkstp) January 5, 2026\n\nTim Walz has gone from hero to goat for the same reason: his corruption.

Tim Walz Will Not Seek Reelection Following Unsuccessful VP Run","text":"Tim Walz, who was the Democratic nominee for vice president in the 2024 presidential election, will not seek a third term as the governor of Minnesota.\n\nIn a lengthy statement released Monday, January 5, the 61-year-old said he “decided to step out of the race and let others worry about the election while I focus on the work.”\n\n“I won’t mince words here,” Walz said. “Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place. They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.”\n\nWalz, who ran alongside former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, tore into the Republican party and said that Minnesotans should be “concerned about fraud in our state government.”\n\n“We’ve got the President of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on,” he said. “It is disgusting. And it is dangerous. Republicans are playing politics with the future of our state. And it’s shameful.”\n\nWalz reflected on his decision to “run for a historic third term as Minnesota’s Governor” and admitted that he rethought his choice with his family and his team over the holidays.\n\n“I came to the conclusion that I can’t give a political campaign my all,” he said. “Every minute I spend defending my own political interests would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who prey on our differences.”\n\nDespite Walz’s decision to not seek reelection, he said that his work will continue.\n\n“I want Minnesotans to know that I’m on the job, 24/7, focused on making sure we stay America’s best place to live and raise kids,” he said. “No one will take that away from us. Not the fraudsters. And not the President. Not on my watch.”\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, Walz and Harris, 61, were defeated by Trump, 79, and Vice President JD Vance, 41.","url":"https://nationalenquirer.com/minnesota-gov-tim-walz-will-not-seek-reelection-following-unsuccessful-vp-run/","image":"https://nationalenquirer.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/MEGA1181407_040-scaled-e1767630507673.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 16:58:15","author":"Michael Gioia","authors":["Michael Gioia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.124},{"id":391456000,"title":"Now That's a Perp Walk: Watch Maduro Hauled to Court Under Heavy Guard","text":"Venezuelan dictator Nicolás Maduro entered the next phase of the \"find out\" drama on Monday.\n\nThe ousted Venezuelan president and his wife have now arrived at the Manhattan federal court where they'll go before a judge later today on narco-terrorism charges.The armored car carrying Nicolas Maduro and Cilia Flores reversed into a secured area at the courthouse just before 7:45 a.m.Scores of heavily armed DEA officers and NYPD cops swarmed the streets as the transfer took place.\n\nThey stashed him in an armored car to get him to court. \n\nNow this is one heck of a perp walk. \n\nMaduro faces four counts in the superseding indictment, as my colleague Susie Moore explained.\n\nCount I - Narco-Terrorism ConspiracyCount II - Cocaine Importation ConspiracyCount III - Possession of Machineguns and Destructive DevicesCount IV - Conspiracy to Possess Machineguns and Destructive Devices\n\nOthers are also charged.

All 435 districts of the U.S. House of Representatives, meanwhile, are holding elections.\n\nRepublicans presently control the White House and both chambers of Congress, but their majorities in both legislative chambers are narrow; Democrats need only a net gain of four seats to flip the Senate and a net of three districts to take control of the House.\n\nAs is often the case, many of the races are seen as foregone conclusions, with Republican and Democratic candidates in most states and districts comfortably assured of victory. Yet key toss-up races could end up shifting some control of the national government to Democrats.\n\nChief among them is the Senate race in Maine, where GOP Sen. Susan Collins is facing reelection in a state Trump lost by about 7 points in 2024.\n\nMaine has voted strongly in favor of Democratic presidential candidates for many years — the last time a Republican president took the state was 1988 — and while Collins has easily won election or reelection five times there since 1996, this year’s race could present a more significant challenge for the Republican, due in part to Trump’s declining favorability ratings.\n\nCollins, who identifies as Catholic, next year may find herself racing against state Gov. Janet Mills, who is currently vying for the state’s Democratic nomination. The University of Virginia’s Center for Politics switched Maine to a “toss-up” election in October, citing Collins’ middling approval numbers and Mills’ potential challenge.\n\nThe Center for Politics points to three other “toss-up” Senate elections in 2026, those of Georgia, North Carolina, and Michigan.\n\nIn North Carolina, Republican Sen. Thom Tillis will not seek reelection, presenting an opportunity for Democrats to pick up another seat. Former state Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has declared his candidacy there, as has former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley.\n\nA Democratic stronghold for years, the North Carolina state government has overall leaned more Republican since around 2010, though GOP presidential candidates have done well there for longer. Yet the state has overwhelmingly voted for Democratic governors for decades with few exceptions, and Trump’s vulnerability — polls show high levels of disapproval of the president there — could give Democrats a boost in a state they likely need to win to obtain control of the Senate.\n\nHouse considered a toss-up; some states consider life, religion proposals\n\nIn Georgia, Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff is expected to defend the seat he won in 2021, though he could be ousted in the primary election in May, when Republicans will also choose their candidate.\n\nIn Michigan, meanwhile, Democratic Sen. Gary Peters is retiring, leaving Democrats scrambling to elect a new candidate; no clear challenger has yet emerged in either party there, with a primary election set for Aug. 4.\n\nThough Michigan hasn’t elected a Republican senator in about 25 years, the state’s critical role in national elections will likely render it a competitive race into November. Trump beat Kamala Harris for the state’s electors by just over 1% in 2024; he lost that state to Joe Biden in 2020 by about 3%.\n\nAnalysts, meanwhile, say the U.S. House is a potential flip for Democrats. The Center for Politics projects a tentative 211-208 Democratic majority there.\n\nOutgoing Democratic Rep. Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, predicted last week that Democrats would “win the House back” in November, declaring that Republican control of Congress will be “over” in 2027.\n\nAmid the candidate elections, voters in some states will consider numerous ballot issues that could also offer referendums on Republican governance and Trump’s second term.\n\nSome states are considering ballot initiatives related to abortion. Missouri voters will decide whether or not to enact sweeping restrictions on abortion in the state, while Nevada voters may amend the state’s constitution to create a right to an abortion there.\n\nThe Missouri measure, if passed, would also prohibit doctors from performing “gender transition” procedures on underage children. Abortion-related proposals may also appear on the ballots in Virginia, Idaho, and Oregon.\n\nSome states may also consider religion-related ballot proposals. In West Virginia, voters in 2026 may consider a measure that would amend the state constitution to allow churches and religious denominations to incorporate under state law.\n\nA potential proposal in Wisconsin, meanwhile, would prohibit the government from closing churches in response to public health emergencies and other crises.\n\nAhead of the midterms, Milwaukee Archbishop Jeffrey Grob last week lamented that politics in the United States has become “so polarized” and warned Catholics not to “get caught in camps” that amplify political differences.\n\n“Bishops, priests, deacons, church leaders that are not Catholic, other leaders — it’s easy to get drawn into one camp or another camp, whatever the case may be,” the prelate told WISN-TV.\n\n“We have to remain true to ourselves,” he said, “and it’s not to a particular party, but it is to our Catholic faith.”","summary":"cna","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/cna/a-look-ahead-2026-u-s-midterms-hinge-on-key-races-in-maine-north-carolina","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20260105070136_6009997f91d462686342f1812def65e404ee1ca48ee51684d633fcaa104fd837.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 16:13:27","author":"Daniel Payne/cna","authors":["Daniel Payne/cna"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.295},{"id":391440252,"title":"In 2026, All Bets Are Off","text":"Predictions are often wrong. Nobody has a crystal ball they can look into to predict what will happen this year, but columnists always fall prey to temptation.\n\nAll we can be sure of is that President Trump will conduct domestic and world affairs at the same frenetic pace that he brought into play last year. With Mr. Trump, all bets are off. Or are they?\n\nIt’s an entirely safe bet that there will be no peace — far less a lasting peace — in Ukraine. Russian President Vladimir Putin doesn’t want peace and even if there is a cease-fire — which I doubt — he will continue the war at his own pace.\n\nRussia has already increased their attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure and the capital city of Kiev. Russian forces have a new tactic that sends handfuls of men into Ukraine to see how far they get and then following on with a major attack if the handful is successful.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni will continue to defy the EUnuchs and make Italy a stronger economy than France or Germany. President Trump has helped by cutting back tariffs on Italian spaghetti.\n\nChina will continue to press its aggression in the South China Sea and around Asia. They have reportedly developed an airborne drone carrier — an aircraft carrier that isn’t so big it can be spotted by satellites — which is a new threat we will have to deal with and possibly copy. Their attack on Taiwan isn’t supposed to come until 2027 but it could come earlier.\n\nIn Israel, the war that Hamas started on October 7, 2023 will heat up again with a major Israeli attack on the Gaza Strip, probably before April. Hamas isn’t going to disarm and the Israelis cannot allow it to regain control of Gaza which would mean more attacks on Israeli civilians. Instead, Israel will attack Hamas again and try to finish what Hamas started.\n\nThe rest of the Middle East will be relatively quiet except for the Houthis, Hizballah, and anyone else the Iranians can fund and supply to commit terrorist acts.\n\nThe Houthis will soon resume their bombings of Israeli targets. The Iranians, who are suffering a mini-revolt by their citizenry, will not suffer a revolution although it would be welcomed by the Iranian people. And, well, all the rest of the Middle East will continue its pattern of small wars that have a danger of exploding into big wars.\n\nMr. and Mrs. Nicholas Maduro, having been brought to New York City by U.S. forces will ask to be released on cashless bail, planning to voluntarily deport to parts unknown. They presumably won’t get away with that. Maduro’s minions are already departing Venezuela because they don’t want to end up like him. They fear what will happen to them if the Venezuelans regain democracy.\n\nWho is going to run Venezuela in Maduro’s absence and before an election can be held? Probably Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has three or four jobs already. He must be exhausted.\n\nThe 2028 presidential race will begin in earnest. California Gov. Gavin Nuisance is probably the Dems best bet at this point but he will be challenged by nonentities such as Kamala Harris, several Dem senators, and other idiots.\n\nIn Congress, there will be much to make fun of. Rep. Alexandria Cutie-Cortez (D-NY) will probably mount a primary challenge to Sen. Chuck Schumer, lose the primary and stay in Congress. Meanwhile, on the unfunny side, the Republicans will probably lose the House and possibly the Senate as well.\n\nUnfortunately, there will be no denaturalization and deportation of Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN), despite allegations of immigration fraud. A substantial portion of her constituency is apparently involved in the child welfare fraud. If enough can be deported, she could lose an election.\n\nThe outrageous fraud that is encompassing Minnesota, and Gov. “Tampon Tim” Walz, is just the beginning. There are certainly too many people involved in it to even bring to trial. They can’t self-deport (who wants to go to Somalia?) but ICE and the Justice Department may have the last laugh. (Timmy earned his nickname by requiring tampons in boys’ school bathrooms. Can you imagine what pre-teen and teenage boys did with them? How about running around with the tampons stuck in their ears and noses?)\n\nMassive welfare/child welfare/Medicaid/housing and other frauds are going on in California, Illinois, New York, and several other states. The Justice Department will try to bring several suits against the states and cities where it is going on, trying to reclaim the money lost which is impossible given the states’ and cities’ broken budgets.\n\nThe Dems have nothing to say except that they hate Trump and that may be enough for this year’s election. If they win the House, they’ll try — for the fourth time — to remove Trump after impeachment. It won’t work.\n\nThere will be a lot of other political nonsense. New York City’s new Mayor Zohran Mamdani won’t get the discriminatory taxation he wants thanks to Gov. Kathy Hochul and the state assembly, who don’t want to raise taxes if they don’t get more than their share. Mamdani can’t pay for all the socialist largesse he wants to provide without it because New York City can’t afford it. It’s just as Margaret Thatcher once said: the problem with socialism is that you eventually run out of other peoples’ money to spend.\n\nIn Africa, the Somalis will continue fighting against Somaliland while the Somali population of Minnesota continues its frauds against the federal government and the state.\n\nThe Indiana University football team will win the college football playoffs, an event that is unthinkable in Alabama, Florida, Texas, and several other states. IU winning the football championship is like the 1969 Mets winning the World Series. Good luck to them.\n\nAfter all is said and done, the year will proceed as preceding years have. There will be wars and suffering and plenty of political chicanery to go around. I will have to return to my usual year-end column to recount it all for you this time next year.\n\nREAD MORE from Jed Babbin:\n\nA Trump-Worthy Year for the Military\n\nISIS Isn’t Defeated — and Syria Proves It\n\nThe ‘Donroe’ Doctrine at Sea","summary":"Predictions are often wrong.

But after a meteoric fall from grace, Coach Tim announced on Monday that he has danced his last political waltz. Although he is not resigning from office — at least not yet — Gov. Tim Walz will not seek a third term leading the Gopher State. In the end, the massive scale of Somali fraud that went unchecked under his nose was just too much to recover from. Bad news on the Somali front snowballed fast for Walz, with reports that as much as $9 billion — with a \"b\" — was pilfered by members of the migrant community, while the governor appeared to do little but protect the thieves. Walz might have survived this embroglio had he taken it more seriously as the scandal broke, but the intrepid work of independent journalist Nick Shirley, whose shocking videos of empty day care centers receiving millions from taxpayers, were likely the final straw. ALEX BERENSON: MINNESOTA LEARNED THE HARD WAY THAT TRIBES DON'T VANISH AT THE BORDER In an interesting twist, Walz’s complete refusal to place any blame on the Somali community or its leaders may well have also played a key role in his political demise. Voters I spoke with in Minneapolis just three weeks ago — especially White voters — also were extremely reluctant to place responsibility for fraud on the migrant community. That left one set of shoulders to bear the entire weight of the scandal: Tim Walz’s. In his remarks Monday, Walz said that given the situation, he could not devote all his energy to a campaign. Of course, he blamed that on Republicans and racism — what else? TIM WALZ PUSHES BACK ON MINNESOTA FRAUD ALLEGATIONS FOLLOWING VIRAL DAYCARE VIDEO \"We’ve got the president of the United States demonizing our Somali neighbors and wrongly confiscating childcare funding that Minnesotans rely on. It is disgusting. And it is dangerous,\" Walz offered as an excuse for his own incredible failings. Ultimately, Walz decided to blow up his political career rather than be accused of racism by accurately addressing the broad, systemic fraud rampant in Minnesota’s Somali community. From day one, the selection of Walz as Harris’s running mate — which made him a leading face in the national Democratic Party — seemed a bizarre choice. In theory, Walz was supposed to appeal to everyday White guys and give them permission to vote for a Black woman. MINNESOTA GOP LAWMAKERS CITE CONSTITUTION IN CALL FOR WALZ TO RESIGN OVER FRAUD CRISIS There are two problems with this. The first is that \"everyday\" White guys like Walz approximately as much as they like watching their wives slowly pick out linens at Bed Bath & Beyond. The second is that \"everyday\" White guys would have no problem voting for a Black woman who was competent and didn’t cackle like a lunatic every three sentences. As someone who spends much of his time talking to \"everyday\" White guys across the country, it was clear that whoever thought Walz had this appeal to male voters was someone looking at too much polling and who has never been to the Rust Belt outside of airport lounges. In the end, it was this utter and complete lack of authenticity that also doomed the governor as the Somali fraud scandal swirled. Each of his piteous claims that critics were simply motivated by racism dug his political hole deeper and deeper. FORMER WALZ RIVAL SAYS FRAUD HAS MINNESOTANS ‘FED UP’ AND DEMANDING ACCOUNTABILITY Watching Walz struggle to wish away one of the biggest fraud scandals in American history was more awkward than watching him try to load a shotgun. In both cases, he seemed to be trying to sell something to voters that even he didn’t really believe. This is also a tragic day for the members of the liberal media who spent weeks defending Walz’s shambolic handling of the Somali scandal, telling us it was no big deal and that it happens everywhere. Really? If so, then why is he suddenly exiting public life in January 2027? CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Tim Walz will go down in history as little more than an avatar of White guilt — the weak, apologetic eunuch of a White guy that progressives would have all of our sons become. But today, our sons can clearly see that the real lesson is: \"Don’t be that guy.\" Reports indicate that Democrat Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a woman with her own presidential ambitions, may now run in Walz’s stead. This is telling, since Klobuchar, as a federal official, has none of the stench of the scandal on her that most, if not all, Minnesota state Democrat officials do. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The good news for Walz is that now he has more time to work on his pickup truck while knocking back a few brewskies and telling tales of high school football glory — or whatever it is he thinks White guys do all day.

Tim Walz, Democrats' 2024 candidate for vice president, is ending his bid for a third term as governor amid President Donald Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into child care programs in the state.\n\nLess than four months after announcing his reelection campaign, Walz said in a statement Monday that he could no longer devote the energy necessary to win another term, even as he expressed confidence that he could win. He cited ongoing attention on the fraud cases and described an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state,\" while also noting the accomplishments of his first seven years in office.\n\n“Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said, referring to the Trump administration withholding funds for the programs. “They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.”\n\nWalz's decision scrambles the contest in a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans have insisted they can win. Democrats currently hold 24 out of 50 governor's seats nationwide, with 36 seats, including Minnesota's, on the ballot in 2026.\n\nThe candidates to replace Walz\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is considering entering the Minnesota race, according to a person close to her. The person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator, who ran for president in 2020, has not made a final decision.\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running. They include MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, an election denier who is close to Trump. They also include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator from Chaska who was the party’s 2022 candidate; state Rep. Kristin Robbins, of Maple Grove; defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor Chris Madel; former executive Kendall Qualls; and former Minnesota GOP Chair David Hann.\n\nA military veteran, union supporter and former high school educator and coach, Walz helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nKamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election after his attack line against Trump and his running mate, then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance — “These guys are just weird” — spread widely.\n\nWalz continued building his national profile since his and Harris' defeat in November. He was a sharp critic of Trump as he toured early caucus and primary states. In May, he called on Democrats in South Carolina to stand up to the Republican president, saying, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner.”\n\nReactions to Walz's decision reflected the intense partisanship certain to spill into the campaign to serve as his successor.\n\nReactions to Walz's announcement\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, another Minnesotan, said Walz “entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.\" Walz's guiding principle, Martin added, “has always been showing up and doing the work that actually makes their lives better.”\n\nDemocratic Governors Association Chair Andy Beshear, the second-term Kentucky governor, praised Walz as a “a national leader in fighting for the middle class” and said his organization “remains very confident Minnesotans will elect another strong Democratic governor this November.”\n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokeswoman Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for “failed leadership” and argued that the eventual Democratic nominee “will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.”\n\nA look at Walz's 2 terms\n\nThrough nearly two terms as governor, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nHe used the office’s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and close schools, prompting Republican pushback.\n\nRepublicans also were critical of Walz over what they saw as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Walz pleaded for calm after Floyd's death but also stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence.\n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. Minnesota eliminated nearly all of the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youth and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Walz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nThat record, combined with Walz’s rural background and experience representing southern Minnesota in Congress, landed him on Harris’ radar as she considered potential running mates in 2024 after replacing Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. After a whirlwind search, she opted for Walz over other candidates including North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters but drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

Walz, a 61-year-old former teacher and coach, became governor of the Midwestern state in 2019, and gained national prominence in 2024 as the running mate of then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic candidate who lost to Trump. Recently, the Trump administration has singled out Walz and Minnesota, including its large population of Somali Americans and Somali immigrants, over allegations of fraud, dating back to 2020, by nonprofit groups that administer the state's childcare and other social services programs with support from federal funding. At least 56 people have pleaded guilty since federal prosecutors brought charges in 2022, under Trump's Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden. In his announcement, Walz referred to the fraud allegations as a crisis, and said he wanted to \"let others worry about the election while I focus on the work\". He also criticized Trump and other Republicans, who personally deride Walz, for what he called bad-faith attacks. The election is in November. U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat from Minnesota, is considering a run for governor, but has not made any announcement. \"For the last several years, an organized group of criminals have sought to take advantage of our state's generosity,\" Walz said in his statement. \"And even as we make progress in the fight against the fraudsters, we now see an organized group of political actors seeking to take advantage of the crisis.\" He said the state welcomed federal support to fight fraud, but said Trump and other Republicans \"want to make our state a colder, meaner place\" and called them \"opportunists who are willing to hurt our people to score a few cheap points.\" He appeared before reporters on Monday morning at his office in Saint Paul, the state capital, to read his statement aloud before leaving without taking questions. The Trump administration, which has vowed to deport more immigrants than any prior administration, has singled out Minnesota for investigations and in social media posts, alleging rampant fraud is being committed by nonprofit groups serving immigrants in the welfare system. In 2022, federal prosecutors brought charges against the nonprofit group Feeding Our Future, accusing it of fraud over COVID-19 pandemic relief funds intended to provide meals to children. Most of those who have pleaded guilty so far are Somali Americans, although the founder of the nonprofit is a white American woman, who was convicted last year of fraud charges. The prosecutions have continued under Trump, and he and other administration officials have frequently and sharply criticized the state's Somali communities, as well as Walz, and Representative Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American Democrat who represents a Minneapolis-based district in Congress. On Friday, the Trump administration released a statement describing what it called its \"relentless assault to dismantle the massive fraud empires built in Minnesota under the watch of incompetent Democrats like Tim Walz and his Radical Left enablers\". The same day, Walz signed an executive order that creates a new investigative unit focused on fraud. Although the scandal came to light more than three years ago, the Trump administration's attention has returned to it in recent days thanks in part to a 42-minute video posted on social media on Dec. 26 by Nick Shirley, a pro-Trump influencer who has met with the president at the White House's invitation. The video, which purports to expose extensive fraud at childcare centers in Minnesota's Somali community, has since received over 138 million views. On Monday, Shirley, 23, wrote on social media: \"I ENDED TIM WALZ.\" (Reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York; Additional reporting by Helen Coster in New York;Editing by Nick Zieminski) By Jonathan Allen","url":"https://www.marketscreener.com/news/minnesota-governor-walz-will-not-seek-third-term-to-focus-on-welfare-fraud-scandal-ce7e59dedd81f025","image":"https://cdn.zonebourse.com/static/resize/0/0//images/reuters/2026-01/2026-01-05T153422Z_1_LYNXMPEM040U6_RTROPTP_4_USA-ELECTION-MINNESOTA-WALZ.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-05 15:37:45","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"fr","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":391427050,"title":"Tim Walz, Democrats’ 2024 VP candidate, exits Minnesota governor race as Klobuchar weighs bid","text":"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Democrats’ 2024 candidate for vice-president, is ending his bid for a third term as governor amid President Donald Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into child care programmes in the state.\nLess than four months after announcing his re-election campaign, Walz said on Monday that he could no longer devote the energy necessary to win another term, even as he expressed confidence that he could win.\nWalz said in a statement on Monday that he “can’t give a political campaign my all” after what he described as an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state”.\n“Donald Trump and his allies – in Washington, in St Paul, and online – want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said, referring to the Trump administration withholding funds for the programmes. “They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbours.
