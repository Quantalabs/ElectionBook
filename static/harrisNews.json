Another said: 'And neither was cool. What a s*** thing to say. Fair-weather friend'.\n\nAnother fan said: 'got it…so you used TK and TS for your podcast views and enjoy him getting fully disrespected in a personal way on here'.\n\nAnd amid the outrage from Swifties, Tart added fuel to the fire by reposting a famous Dave Chappelle skit depicting American singer and songwriter Rick James slapping comedian Charlie Murphy.\n\nHe shared the skit - which sees Chappelle's fictional James character ask Murphy 'what did the five fingers say to the face?' before smacking him - along with two laughing emojis in a clear reference to his altercation with Kelce.\n\nMeanwhile, back in June, both Kelce and Swift posed for a picture alongside Lewan and his co-host for the 'Bussin' With The Boys' podcast, Will Compton, at Kelce's Tight End University events in Nashville.\n\nHowever, due to their affiliation with Donald Trump, Swift and Kelce came under fire for hanging with the duo, who shared the photo of the quartet on social media.\n\nFans of Kelce - and Taylor Swift - labelled Lewan a 'fair-weather friend' after his comment\n\nChiefs star Kelce has made multiple appearance on Lewan's podcast; Bussin' With The Boys\n\n'Confirmed: Taylor Swift is FOR THE BOYS,' they captioned the picture on social media. But the viral image has caused fury among Swifties, one of whom asked: 'Where the f*** is her self-respect?'\n\nA week after the photo was posted, Kelce featured on the 'Bussin' With The Boys' podcast for the second time, having made his debut on the show last year.\n\nDonald Trump appeared on 'Bussin With The Boys' ahead of last year's election and the ex-NFL stars were even given a shoutout during his victory celebrations.\n\nDana White namechecked the podcast for helping propel Trump to victory over Kamala Harris. Back in 2023, Compton and Lewan were also seen shaking hands with the president at a UFC event.\n\nLos Angeles ChargersTravis KelceBrazil\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTravis Kelce's friend sucks up to Chargers man who smacked the Chiefs star with cringe Instagram comment\n\nAdd comment","summary":"On Friday night, Kelce was smacked in the face by Los Angeles Chargers defender Teair Tart midway through the Chiefs' 27-21 season-opening defeat in Brazil.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-15073337/Travis-Kelce-Chargers-smack-Chiefs-Instagram-comment.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/07/01/101892801-0-Los_Angeles_Chargers_defender_Teair_Tart_has_poked_fun_at_his_vi-a-16_1757203708513.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 00:24:50","author":"Editor,James Cohen","authors":["Editor","James Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.276},{"id":358104292,"title":"2025 Creative Arts Emmys: See all the winners so far","text":"Ahead of the 2025 Primetime Emmys next week, a majority of this year's trophies are being given out during this weekend's Creative Arts Emmys.\n\n Winners in nearly 100 categories will be chosen on Saturday and Sunday during a two-night event at the Peacock Theater at L.A.

West Point canceled an award ceremony intended to honor two-time Oscar winner and veterans advocate Tom Hanks. He was scheduled to be honored on September 25 with the Sylvanus Thayer Award. Hanks, a longtime backer of Democratic candidates and causes, was also recently criticized for his portrayal of a President Trump supporter as a ‘racist.’“This decision allows the Academy to continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world’s most lethal force, the United States Army,” wrote Retired Army Col. Mark Bieger in an email to alumni on Friday, as reported by The Washington Post.Details on the Sylvanus Thayer AwardThe Sylvanus Thayer Award recognizes an “outstanding citizen” who did not attend West Point but exemplifies the academy’s ideals of “Duty, Honor, Country.” The ceremony was to include a parade attended by the entire Corps of Cadets and is considered the closest equivalent to an honorary degree from West Point. Colonel Sylvanus Thayer served as the academy’s superintendent from 1817 to 1833.The email from Bieger did not clarify whether Hanks’ award had been revoked or would be presented at a later date, as per the outlet.What west point and hanks said earlierLive EventsRobert McDonald, a former secretary of veterans affairs and the alumni association’s board chairman, announced it in June: “Tom Hanks has done more for the positive portrayal of the American service member, more for the caring of the American veteran, their caregivers and their family, and more for the American space program and all branches of government than many other Americans.”According to the release on West Point dated June 11, Hank replied, “To have my first ever visit to the Academy be to accept such an honor as the Thayer Award is simply astounding. West Point’s legacy of leadership, character, and service to the nation is a powerful example for all Americans. To be recognized by an institution whose graduates have shaped our country’s history through selfless service is both humbling and meaningful,” says Hanks.Hank’s Record of Veteran Support and Political InvolvementTom Hanks, 69, has a history of making anti-Trump comments and has donated to Democratic figures, including former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, as well as presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris. The June announcement by the alumni group recognized Hanks’ role in advocating for veterans and cited his portrayals of US service members in films such as Forrest Gump and Saving Private Ryan.Why did West Point cancel Tom Hanks’ award ceremony?According to The Washington Post, the decision may have been influenced by Trump-era politics. Hanks supported Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign and appeared in a 2022 video highlighting the Biden administration’s achievements.As reported by Forbes, President Trump introduced several changes at West Point, including rolling back programs promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Jen Easterly, who served as cybersecurity chief under the Biden administration, was dismissed in June after complaints from Trump loyalist Laura Loomer. Additionally, a 20-foot portrait of Gen. Robert E. Lee, a West Point graduate who fought in the Civil War to preserve slavery, was rehung in the academy’s library.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTom Hanks award ceremony cancellationWest Point Association of GraduatesWest Point alumni controversyTom Hanks veteran supportSylvanus Thayer Award Tom HanksTrump politics West PointWest Point diversity equity inclusionWest Point core missionUS Military AcademyTom Hanks Democratic advocate\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Mark Bieger, president and chief executive officer of the West Point Association of Graduates, per the outlet. He explained in his email why the decision was ultimately made.\n\n “This decision allows the Academy to continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world’s most lethal force, the United States Army,” he wrote.\n\n Bieger did not mention whether Hanks would still receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award at a later event or in a different format, according to The Washington Post.\n\n PEOPLE has reached out to the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and reps for Hanks for comment.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n The U.S. Military Academy at West Point announced in June that Hanks would receive the Thayer Award, which is given annually to an outstanding citizen of the U.S. “whose service and accomplishments in the national interest exemplify personal devotion to the ideals expressed in West Point’s motto: ‘Duty, Honor, Country.’ ”\n\n At the time of the announcement, the school’s board chairman, Robert A. McDonald, explained that Hanks would be given the award, in part, due to his portrayal of the life of a “service member” in several of his films, including Saving Private Ryan, Forrest Gump and Greyhound.\n\n “Tom Hanks has done more for the positive portrayal of the American service member, more for the caring of the American veteran, their caregivers and their family, and more for the American space program and all branches of government than many other Americans,” McDonald said in a statement.\n\n The academy also said that Hanks was being honored for his support of the military, after previously serving as national chairperson of the D-Day Museum Capital Campaign and joining former U.S. Senator Bob Dole as a national spokesperson for the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C. \n\n Reacting to the forthcoming honor at the time, Hanks — who noted at the time that the award ceremony would have been his first time visiting the academy — said in a statement, “To be recognized by an institution whose graduates have shaped our country’s history through selfless service is both humbling and meaningful.”\n\n The news of the canceled awards ceremony comes amid a period of transition at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, which has faced significant changes since Donald Trump’s presidency. Per The Washington Post, Trump’s directives led to the rollback of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the armed forces, as well as heightened scrutiny of leadership, curricula and faculty at all U.S. service academies.\n\n Hanks was a vocal supporter of the Biden administration, and also endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. In 2022, the actor narrated a video for Joe Biden's inauguration anniversary, touting his administration's accomplishments. Hanks also joined a group of prominent Greek-Americans in signing an open letter in support of Harris' presidential bid in October 2024, per The National Herald.","summary":"Hanks was slated to receive the 2025 Sylvanus Thayer Award at a Sept. 25 ceremony hosted by the U.S. Military Academy at West Point","url":"https://people.com/tom-hanks-dropped-from-west-point-awards-ceremony-11804948","image":"https://people.com/thmb/cqcxaMTA04Ut2guonxCS5nadWVQ=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(795x299:797x301)/Tom-Hanks-060425-0ba2a67c5a834ff49c499f6ff74634eb.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 20:49:41","author":"Kimberlee Speakman","authors":["Kimberlee Speakman"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":358068860,"title":"Anthony Kim takes a jibe at Kamala Harris' ex-running mate Tim Walz in his latest X post","text":"Despite his relegation from LIV Golf, Anthony Kim keeps his fans updated with clips from his practice sessions, where he flaunts his swing.

LAPD’s Metropolitan Division officers had been stationed outside Harris’ Brentwood home to support the California Highway Patrol (CHP) after President Trump revoked her Secret Service protection earlier this week. Sources told the Times the move was brief and meant to prevent a lapse in coverage, but it drew backlash from within the force. Officers had been pulled from crime suppression duties in the San Fernando Valley, sparking frustration inside the department. Why the Security Arrangement Became Contentious Mayor Karen Bass had directed the LAPD to assist the CHP temporarily, but the arrangement quickly came under fire. The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union representing rank-and-file officers, criticised the deployment as an unnecessary strain on city resources. “The department is assisting the CHP until an alternate plan is established,” LAPD spokesperson Jennifer Forkish said on Thursday, describing it as a stopgap measure, per the Los Angeles Times. The CHP has not clarified how LAPD’s withdrawal will alter its plans for protecting Harris, nor has Harris’ office commented on whether she will hire private security. Fox 11 earlier showed aerial images of LAPD officers posted outside Harris’ residence. Legal Entitlement and Trump’s Revocation Under federal law, former vice presidents receive six months of Secret Service protection after leaving office. President Biden extended Harris’ coverage, but Trump revoked that order last week, citing discretion afforded to the sitting president, Reuters reported. Without the federal detail, Harris’ security fell to local agencies until she arranges private coverage. This is not the first time discretionary extensions have been revoked; however, the rarity of a former vice president losing federally funded protection has raised questions about political motives. Analysts say the incident underscores the discretionary power presidents wield in extending or terminating protection for ex-officials.

As per a CNN investigation, all of Antoni’s posts came from the same Twitter account, and the posts from the anonymous aliases shared strikingly similar biographical details as Antoni.\nAntoni has been an outspoken critic of the non-partisan BLS, which calculates US job growth and unemployment figures. His appointment came after Trump fired the Biden-appointed BLS commissioner and accused the agency of corruption, without evidence, after a report showed job growth in May and June was weaker than previously estimated.\nHe works at the conservative think tank, Heritage Foundation, and has positioned himself as an advocate of government accountability through the organisation’s blog posts and media appearances. However, his digital presence is traced back to a pattern of offensive rhetoric that includes conspiracy theories and misogyny.\nAntoni’s Attacks On Top Democrats\nAntoni’s account was used to make degrading and sexist remarks about female Democratic politicians, including Kamala Harris, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar, as per the CNN report. It was also used to make unsubstantiated allegations against left-leaning public figures and bigoted attacks towards gay TV news anchors.\nIn 2019, the now-deleted account known as “ErwinJohnAntoni” changed its username to “phdofbombsaway”, and posted five sexually suggestive tweets implying that then-Senator Kamala Harris had advanced her career through sexual favours.\nHe also referred to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, as “Miss Piggy” and retweeted several misogynistic posts. The account was also used to propagate conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 pandemic and the 2020 presidential elections.\nHis remarks include calling Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez a “whack job” and a “space cadet”. In March 2020, Antoni tweeted about Democratic Representative Rashida Tlaib, a Trump critic, saying, “No one wants to have sex with that catfish.”\nIn one post, he dismissed the existence of LGBTQ people, saying, “There is only one sexual orientation — everything else is a disorientation.” He also argued against abortion even in cases of rape.\nConcerns over Antoni’s Appointment\nAntoni was nominated to be the next BLS commissioner after Trump ordered the dismissal of Erika McEntarfer, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, on August 1 after accusing her of publishing “phony” job creation numbers for July.\nThe White House defended Antoni and did not address the offensive tweets he made earlier. “President Trump has nominated Dr. EJ Antoni to fix the issues at the BLS and restore trust in the jobs reports. Dr. Antoni has the experience and credentials needed to restore solution-oriented leadership at the BLS — solutions that will prioritise increasing survey response rates and modernising data collection methods to improve the BLS’s accuracy,” CNN quoted White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers.\nHowever, Antoni has no experience working for the government, unlike McEntarfer. He earned a PhD in economics from Northern Illinois University in 2020 and took positions at the Texas Public Policy Foundation and the Heritage Foundation, which is believed to be the architect of Project 2025, a blueprint for Trump’s second term.\nAntoni’s work as an economist has also come under scrutiny after he co-published a report last year that claimed that the American economy had been in a recession since 2022, sparking backlash from economists across political circles.\nIn past media appearances, Antoni has echoed Trump’s dissatisfaction with labour statistics and the Federal Reserve. Earlier this year, he accused the central bank of “election interference” for cutting rates close to the 2024 presidential election, a claim Trump has also made.","summary":"EJ Antoni, who was nominated by Trump to lead the Bureau of Labour Statistics, allegedly operated a Twitter account that featured sexually degrading attacks against Democrats.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/trumps-pick-for-labour-stats-dept-linked-to-racist-offensive-remarks-against-democrats-ws-bkl-9554498.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/09/trump-antoni-2025-09-0f1ae1569e2c81b12c09915f84ca01a5.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 16:54:25","author":"Aveek Banerjee,News18","authors":["Aveek Banerjee","News18"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.356},{"id":358048102,"title":"LAPD ends protection of former Vice President Kamala Harris amid criticism over diverting cops, sources say","text":"The Los Angeles Police Department on Saturday discontinued its protection for former Vice President Kamala Harris after heavy criticism within its own ranks that officers were being diverted from crime suppression, sources told The Times. LAPD Metropolitan Division officers had been assisting the California Highway Patrol in protecting Harris and were visible until Saturday morning outside her Brentwood home. Both California police agencies scrambled this week to protect Harris after President Trump, her rival in November's election, revoked Harris’s Secret Service protection last week. Thursday. President Biden had extended that protection for Harris beyond the six months after leaving office that vice presidents traditionally get. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass had directed the LAPD to provide the security team to assist the CHP in the short term. According to sources, those Metro officers had to be drawn away from crime suppression work in the San Fernando Valley this week. The department is \"assisting the California Highway Patrol in providing protective services for former Vice President Kamala Harris until an alternate plan is established,\" said Jennifer Forkish, L.A. police communications director, on Thursday. \"This temporary coordinated effort is in place to ensure that there is no lapse in security.\" The CHP has not indicated how the LAPD's move would alter its arrangement with the former vice president nor said how long it will continue. A dozen or more LAPD officers began working a detail to protect Harris after Trump revoked her Secret Service protection as of Monday. Sources not authorized to discuss the details of the plan said the city would fund the security but that the arrangement was expected to be brief, with Harris hiring her own security in the near future. A security detail was seen outside Harris' Brentwood home by a Fox 11 helicopter as the station broke the story of the use of L.A. police earlier this week. The Los Angeles Police Protective League, the union that represents rank-and-file LAPD officers, criticized the move. \"Pulling police officers from protecting everyday Angelenos to protect a failed presidential candidate who also happens to be a multi-millionaire... and who can easily afford to pay for her own security, is nuts,\" its board of directors said. The statement continued, \"Mayor Karen Bass should tell Governor Newsom that if he wants to curry favor with Ms. Harris and her donor base, then he should open up his own wallet because LA taxpayers should not be footing the bill for this ridiculousness.\" Newsom, who was required to sign off on CHP protection, has not confirmed the arrangement to The Times, but a spokesperson for Newsom added: \"The safety of our public officials should never be subject to erratic, vindictive political impulse.\" Bass, in a statement last week, commented on Trump scrapping the security detail for Harris, saying: \"This is another act of revenge following a long list of political retaliation in the form of firings, the revoking of security clearances, and more. This puts the former Vice President in danger and I look forward to working with the governor to make sure Vice President Harris is safe in Los Angeles.\" Deploying LAPD officers to protect Harris was a source of controversy within the department in years past. During L.A. Police Chief Charlie Beck's tenure, when Harris was a U.S. senator, plainclothes officers served as security and traveled with her from January 2017 to July 2018. Beck said at the time through a spokesman that the protection was granted based on a threat assessment. Beck's successor, Michel Moore, ended the protection in July 2018 after he said a new evaluation determined it was no longer needed. The decision came as The Times filed a lawsuit seeking records from then-Mayor Eric Garcetti detailing the costs of security related to his own extensive travel. Garcetti said he was unaware of the police protection until Moore ended it. Former vice presidents usually get Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office, while former presidents are given protection for life. But before his term ended, then-President Biden signed an order to extend Harris' protection to July 2026. Aides to Harris had asked Biden for the extension. Without it, her security detail would have ended last month, according to sources. The curtailing of Secret Service protection comes as Harris is going to begin a book tour next month for her memoir, titled “107 Days.” The tour has 15 stops, which include visits to London and Toronto. The book title references the short length of her presidential campaign. Harris, the first Black woman to serve as vice president, was the subject of an elevated threat level — particularly when she became the Democratic presidential contender last year. The Associated Press reports, however, a recent threat intelligence assessment by the Secret Service conducted on those it protects, such as Harris, found no red flags or credible evidence of a threat to the former vice president.","summary":"California officials scrambled this week to protect Harris after President Trump revoked her Secret Service protection.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-09-06/lapd-ends-protection-of-ex-vp-kamala-harris-after-criticism-of-diverting-cops-from-crime-suppression","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2c6621e/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2048x1365+0+0/resize/1486x990!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F90%2F61%2F0821d4294a8bb4a19cd2f399e666%2Fla-me-ln-kamala-harri","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 16:25:59","author":"Richard Winton","authors":["Richard Winton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":358028626,"title":"Trump Astride at 7 Months","text":"President Donald Trump’s greatest achievement within six months was simply ending illegal immigration as we had once known it—without “comprehensive immigration reform” or any other rhetorical trickery.\n\nIt remains difficult to find, much less deport, the 10 to 12 million illegal aliens who entered in the last four years.\n\nThose who helped break the law, by design or indifference, now believe it was moral to destroy federal immigration law but immoral to uphold it.\n\nAnd it is still unclear whether former President Joe Biden’s handlers deliberately sabotaged their own border for political and demographic purposes out of sheer orneriness or utter incompetence.\n\nMany of the Left’s cherished totems—massive Green New Deal subsidies, the diversity/equity/inclusion industry, biological males competing in women’s sports, and the U.S. Agency for International Development revolving door—are either comatose or in their death throes.\n\nThe historic drop-off in military recruitment reversed shortly after Trump took office.\n\nRepublican voter registration is up, and Democrat registration is down.\n\nAbroad, Trump finds remarkable successes.\n\nFor now, there are pauses in the fighting between India and Pakistan, Egypt and Somalia, Cambodia and Thailand, Rwanda and Congo, Serbia and Kosovo, and Armenia and Azerbaijan.\n\nMuch credit is due to Trump for brokering ceasefires.\n\nIran will not get a bomb in the next four years—as seemed likely when Biden left office.\n\nThe Middle East’s current most grotesque terrorist cadres and states—Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis—are far weaker than they were when Trump entered office in January.\n\nThere is at least some engagement in envisioning the outlines of a ceasefire in Trump’s inherited Ukraine War.\n\nThe rub is finding the degree of ordnance necessary to convince Putin that increasing Russia’s casualties to more than one million will endanger his own dictatorship sooner than destroy Ukraine.\n\nBreaking up the new three-billion-person China/India/Russia nexus hinges on ending the war.\n\nThe economy is still strong.

Fewer than one quarter of registered voters have a favorable view of the party, while 56 percent hold a negative view, according to a CNBC poll from a few weeks ago.\n\nIt turns out that Joe Biden’s ‘Weekend at Bernie’s” presidency and the Democratic coverup did considerable damage to the party’s brand. And instead of pushing forward with real solutions to the real problems voters face, Democrats have focused almost exclusively on opposing Trump, who is like a catnip to them.\n\nThe constant focus on attacking Trump with little solution-based messaging means they are constantly being defined by Trump, proving that simply being someone who is not someone else is not an inspiring strategy.\n\nMany Democrats have deluded themselves into thinking they lost to Trump twice because they didn’t fight or fight hard enough, especially since they have fought him constantly over the past decade.\n\nLiberal data guy Nate Silver wrote gleefully that the abhorrent national gerrymandering fight, which California Democrats are proudly diving into, signals the end of a decade-plus of a “when they go low, we go high” attitude among Democratic leaders.\n\n“Democrats are fighting mad about Trump-led Republican efforts to conduct mid-decade redistricting in Texas and other states in advance of next year’s midterms — and, perhaps for a change, they’re in a mood to fight back,” he wrote.\n\nSilver’s comments mirror those of many others, including Democratic voters and Gov. Gavin Newsom, who are all clearly misremembering the recent past. I’m not sure at what point Democrats went high in their interactions with Trump: They impeached him twice, prided themselves on how often Democratic states sued the Trump administration, passed laws to try to block his access to the ballot and pursued criminal charges against him, just to name a few things.\n\nThis is all on top of the late-night TV and social media posts mocking him, countless Democrats campaigning against him, and endless news and opinion articles calling him everything from a felon to a rapist to a threat to democracy to Hitler.\n\nIn other words, it’s absurd to think Democrats’ problem was they didn’t fight enough. They might not have fought effectively, but there wasn’t a lack of effort.\n\nWatching the campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination shape up suggests change is not coming soon for Democrats. Former Vice President Kamala Harris can’t decide what she wants to do but she apparently saddled the Democratic National Committee with millions of dollars of debt, which has left a large opening for Newsom, who is trying every gimmick to get attention except actually doing a good job governing.\n\nFor the past few months, Newsom tapped his social media team to impersonate Trump online, typing in all caps, making self-aggrandizing claims (more than normal, that is), and being generally combative. Apparently, it’s working a little.\n\nNewsom has enjoyed a 13-point bump year over year in the latest Emerson College poll, which shows him outperforming former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nNewsom has every incentive to keep the ruse going, but it’s going to be a lot of work to pretend to be someone else for the next few years, especially someone Newsom has called a grifter and compared to Hitler.\n\nNewsom and his catty social media team often boast about how well California performs compared to all other states. But the claims are only true in ways that have nothing to do with Newsom. Does anyone actually think California’s economic wealth has much to do with Newsom’s decision-making? Where Newsom is involved (or completely absent, as the case may be) the state is bad and getting worse.\n\nWorking against Newsom is the fact that he’ll have to keep coming up with gimmicks because his record in California is one of failure. This is the same Newsom who just a few years ago helped inspire progressive thought leader Ezra Klein to write damningly in the New York Times: “If progressivism can’t work there, why should the country believe it can work anywhere else?”\n\nThat was in 2021. Newsom has done nothing to change that perception, though he’ll tweet a bunch of lies and half truths that say otherwise.\n\nThis is also the same Newsom who a few months ago was pretending to be moderate, even somewhat conservative, pro-gun and manly. This was after years of decrying what he called toxic masculinity.\n\nIn fact, there have been so many Newsom’s over the past few years, so many desperate pleas for attention, that something had to work eventually.\n\nBut it probably won’t last. Newsom is having a moment now, but sooner or later impersonating Trump won’t be enough.\n\nIf Democratic leaders are interested in expanding their appeal, they should start by showing they can solve a problem. Any problem. Pick one. There are plenty of things voters need help with.\n\nAnd voters should hold them accountable. Don’t reward Newsom for being obnoxious; reward him for being effective – if he can figure out how.\n\nMatt Fleming is a columnist for the Southern California News Group.

Her interview had been taped in advance.Going forward, CBS said it would only broadcast live or live-to-tape interviews on the show, meaning guests' statements could not be edited, subject to legal or national security restrictions. CBS said the change was made “in response to audience feedback.”The network's news division is being watched closely for how it deals with the Trump administration following the FCC's recent approval of its parent company's takeover by Skydance Media. Shortly before Paramount Global's sale to Skydance was given the OK, Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit from Trump over a “60 Minutes” interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.CBS said it had edited four minutes out of its Noem interview for time. On social media, Noem focused on an excised clip where she made a series of unproven accusations about Abrego Garcia, which she said emphasized “the threat he poses to American public safety.”CBS News noted that the unedited interview was posted on its website and on YouTube, but that didn't stop the complaints.Like the “60 Minutes” settlement, the policy change opens CBS News to charges that it is capitulating to Trump. During an interview on Tuesday with the Daily Caller, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt called “Face the Nation” host Margaret Brennan “stupid.”The new policy also raises the possibility that “Face the Nation” would allow guests to spread unchecked falsehoods on the program. But Brennan will still be able to fact-check or challenge claims made by interview subjects, said a CBS News employee familiar with the change who spoke under condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss it.In its announcement, CBS News said the policy will allow for “greater transparency” in interviews.The case that provoked Trump's lawsuit also involved “Face the Nation.” The president accused the network of deception because different clips aired on “60 Minutes” and “Face the Nation” last fall showed Harris giving different answers to a question posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker.","summary":"CBS News will stop editing 'Face the Nation' interviews after Kristi Noem accused it of cutting her remarks, citing a push for more transparency.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/politics/cbs-forbids-editing-of-face-the-nation-interviews-after-complaints-from-noem","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c2c94f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3183x1671+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F16%2Fda%2F5b3085464e4eb91177a08266b54f%2Fap25238723522783.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 14:14:27","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.341},{"id":358020188,"title":"Nolte: CBS News Admits Defeat, Will Stop Editing On-Air Interviews After Misleading Kristi Noem Clip","text":"Disgraced, far-left CBS News announced a policy change after it was caught selectively editing an interview with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.\n\n“Face the Nation will now only broadcast live or live-to-tape interviews (subject to national security or legal restrictions),” CBS News said in a statement Friday. “This extra measure means the television audience will see the full, unedited interview on CBS and we will continue our practice of posting full transcripts and the unedited video online.”\n\nSo, no more selective editing broadcasts to deliberately damage the Republican and boost the Democrat.\n\nYeah, we’ll see.\n\nThis is the second time CBS has surrendered this year. Back in July, the corrupt outlet agreed to pay out $16 million to President Trump. He sued CBS for election interference after 60 Minutes got caught selectively editing Trump’s presidential opponent, Kamala Harris, to make her look better during her abysmal campaign (she’s a Democrat).\n\nLess than two months after that settlement, CBS was right back to its old regime tricks. In this case, Noem appeared on Face the Nation and laid out the allegations against Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a confirmed illegal alien and credibly accused wife beater/gang banger/human trafficker/child porn solicitor. CBS cut that crucial part of her interview. Its only explanation — and it’s a laughable one — is that out of the full hour broadcast, those 24 seconds put Face the Nation over the time limit.\n\nAt first CBS was defiant.\n\n“Secretary Noem’s Face The Nation interview was edited for time and met all CBS News standards,” the far-left network harrumphed in a statement. “The entire interview is publicly available on YouTube, and the full transcript was posted early Sunday morning at CBSNews.com.”\n\nTranslation: CBS News looked into the accusation against CBS News and found that CBS News did nothing wrong.\n\nThe arrogance in that statement is one thing. What struck me more is that CBS News believes it is still living in the past where it can get away with 1) selectively editing Noem to make the administration looks like it’s obsessively chasing an innocent Maryland Man, and 2) issuing smug statements that will make this all go away.\n\nIt’s not 2007 anymore, y’all.

The catalyst: reports from Puck and other outlets that Paramount Skydance is closing in on a deal to buy Weiss' news startup The Free Press and install her in a leadership role at CBS News. Paramount and The Free Press declined to comment.Shaking up CBS News has been a stated — if nebulous — goal of new Paramount chief David Ellison. When Ellison met the press in August after the merger of Paramount and Skydance, he said he wanted to reach as wide an audience as possible with CBS News and that there were areas where the newsroom could \"do better,\" without offering specifics.Weiss, who left The New York Times in 2020 with a public, anti-woke resignation letter, could inject a different sensibility into CBS News. She's known for bucking liberal and conservative orthodoxy and taking strong stances on particular topics like Israel and college-campus speech. If Weiss tried to push more commentary into the equation, she could face resistance at the network known for its iconic straight-news program \"60 Minutes.\" It also might not work for the audience and advertisers trying to reach them.\"Trying to broaden your audience by bringing in different points of view is rarely successful, particularly with network news,\" said Cathy Rasenberger, a TV industry consultant. \"The median age for network news is 65. They're very loyal to their particular source of news, and when they feel that the source is disloyal, they'll switch.\"TV insiders and analysts said Weiss' biggest potential value would be in helping CBS News improve its digital chops and reach a younger audience.Allie Kosterich, a communications professor at Fordham University, said there could be upside in expanding CBS News' streaming footprint, helped by The Free Press' personality-driven programming.The Free Press has amassed 1.5 million subscribers, including about 170,000 paying ones, and also reaches people through live events, podcasts, and video.Kosterich said she sees opinion-led content helmed by Weiss working well as livestreams and clips on platforms like YouTube. There's also an opening for long-form interviews, diverse debates, and culturally broad stories.It's unclear how much an editorial shake-up could move the needle for a broadcast news network, given the ongoing shift in TV viewer behavior. Broadcast hit a new low at 18.4% of TV viewership in July, according to Nielsen.Some see that as an opportunity for a more wide-ranging overhaul.\"Unlike entertainment and sports, network news audiences shift at a glacial pace,\" said Mitch Metcalf, a TV analyst and former NBC executive. \"CBS News has been stuck in third place for decades in most dayparts, a pale imitation of ABC and NBC News. A fundamental shift in both style and substance is exactly what CBS News needs. There is not much downside risk to a bold move — only upside.\"Terry Moran, a former ABC News anchor who was dropped by the network after he criticized President Donald Trump on social media, said Weiss could help CBS News transition to new platforms where journalism is flourishing. He thinks she could also bring \"healthy friction.\"\"Viewpoint diversity will make things better,\" Moran said. \"There's a monoculture and monothink in established media, and breaking that can only be good.\"If Weiss pulled CBS News to the right, it would come into competition with Fox News and Newsmax.\"The right-wing media landscape is already fairly crowded,\" said Victor Pickard, a media professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School for Communication.\"To move the needle, this deal would have to differentiate from Fox News and 'cable-shout,'\" Kosterich said.The main challenge for Weiss could be winning over the newsroom, which has been under tremendous political pressure.Before the merger, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle Trump's lawsuit over a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris that accused CBS of \"deceptive editing.\" Lawmakers questioned whether the settlement was politically motivated. CBS said it was purely a financial decision.In an extraordinary move, the FCC approved the merger on condition that the new company would present a diversity of political and ideological viewpoints and appoint an ombudsman to evaluate complaints of bias.Just this Friday, CBS News said it would cease editing taped interviews with newsmakers who appear on \"Face the Nation\" — a standard practice — after Trump appointee Kristi Noem complained about cuts to her appearance on the show. CBS News attributed the change to \"audience feedback.\"In this climate, any pulling of the newsroom away from its straight-news roots risks an internal uproar.","summary":"TV insiders and analysts say a Paramount Skydance deal to acquire Bari Weiss' The Free Press could expand its reach, but carries risks.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/bari-weiss-free-press-could-transform-cbs-news-2025-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/68bb170ef9db348adc0aee58?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 09:05:01","author":"Lucia Moses","authors":["Lucia Moses"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.001},{"id":357886818,"title":"Will Trump have to run from the economy?","text":"Last year, Donald Trump couldn't stop talking about the economy. As a presidential candidate, he assailed Democrats for inflation and rode the persistent malaise over the high cost of living right back to the White House, promising swift relief even though economists warned that his plans could actually drive prices higher. Friday's lackluster jobs numbers are a reminder of how quickly the issue could present him, and his party, with political peril as elections approach. The economy added only 22,000 jobs in August, which, New York Times reporter Lydia DePillis explained, is a sign that the labor market appears to be stalling. Looking backward, the news is even worse: A revision to June's figures shows the labor market actually lost 13,000 jobs that month, making it the first negative number since December 2020. There are other signs of trouble. A key measure of underlying inflation rose over the summer as Trump's tariffs put pressure on prices, driving up the costs of things like furniture, appliances and clothing. Manufacturing activity has been shrinking for six months.Live Events It's not clear right now just what will happen to the economy between now and next year's midterm elections. (And Friday's news might deliver an upside for Trump: The darkening labor market could mean that he gets his long-sought cut to the interest rate, as Times reporter Colby Smith pointed out.) But what is clear, right now at least, is that the president has a problem. A recent Gallup poll found that his approval rating on the economy fell to 37% in August, from 42% in February. That's a steep drop from his average approval rating on the economy during his first term, which was 52%. When you dig into specific issues, it doesn't look any better. A poll late last month by The Economist and YouGov found inflation to be the top ranked issue for voters -- and just 34% of them approved of his handling of the issue, according to the poll. And then there's the vibe -- the feeling of malaise that weighed down President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris last fall. Last month, 63% of Americans thought the economy is getting worse, Gallup found -- 1 point higher than the 62% who believed that in October 2024, right before the election. Democrats are seizing the moment as an inflection point, eager to hammer home to voters what Trump has done to make the economy his own as they attempt to wrest control of Congress from Republicans next year. Trump passed expansive tax cuts into law and implemented steep tariffs that have driven up prices of everyday goods and raw materials. He is also trying to exert more control over the historically independent Federal Reserve. \"The American people are feeling the impact of the Trump administration's dangerous one-man command policies in community after community,\" Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., the House minority leader, said in a statement Friday. He added that Trump and Republicans had promised to lower the cost of living, but failed. Democrats have been struggling to unify around how to hit back at Trump, but many have taken a key lesson from their walloping loss in the 2024 elections. They believe a laser focus on the economy can help them win in tough races next year. Voters rated the economy as their top issue in every one of The New York Times and Siena College's preelection polls last year, and exit polls showed that Trump outperformed Harris among those who believed the economy was in poor shape. Trump's White House defended its handling of the economy in a statement Friday. Republicans say the midterms are a lifetime away, and that Trump will be able to shape what voters care about no matter what happens. \"Will the economy always be top of voters' minds? Yes. But did voters care as much about trade, immigration or crime pre-Trump as they do now? No, and that's because Trump has made people care about things he thinks are important,\" said Bill Stepien, a Republican who managed the president's reelection campaign in 2020. \"So don't assume President Trump will be reacting to any issue next November, because he will be trying to drive the discussion in his direction,\" Stepien added. Indeed, Trump is already working hard to make sure the midterms are about anything other than the economy. He has openly said that he believes his crackdown on crime in Washington -- which he has said he intends to expand to cities like Chicago and perhaps New Orleans -- will play well for him next fall. \"I think it's going to be a big, big subject for the midterms,\" he said last week, referring to the issue of crime, \"and I think the Republicans are going to do really well.\"Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump economyinflationRepublican PartyTrump approval ratingDonald Trump\n\n(Catch all the Business News, Breaking News, Budget 2025 Events and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

McNeil was one of four university students from North Carolina who boldly challenged the racial segregation of Woolworth’s lunch counter in Greensboro, N.C. in 1960.\n\nMentioned as one of four freshmen at North Carolina A&T State University, McNeil and his peers took seats at a “whites only” counter on February 1, 1960. Despite being refused service and pressured to move by the store manager and police, the young Black men remained steadfast in their protest.\n\nStatements from North Carolina A&T and the family did not give his cause of death or where he died. McNeil had been living in New York.\n\nDespite recent health struggles, McNeil made an effort to attend this year’s 65th-anniversary event of the sit-in at the university. North Carolina A&T, a historically Black university, shared this information.\n\nMcNeil’s passing leaves Jibreel Khazan, formerly known as Ezell Blair Jr., as the only surviving participant of the original four. The other two participants, Franklin McCain and David Richmond, passed away in 2014 and 1990, respectively.\n\nReflecting on the impactful sit-in during a 2010 interview with the Associated Press, McNeil stated, “We were quite serious, and the issue that we rallied behind was a very serious issue because it represented years of suffering and disrespect and humiliation.” He emphasized the need to address the “evil” of segregation during the 50th anniversary and the International Civil Rights Center & Museum’s opening at the former Woolworth’s site.\n\nThe sit-in sparked a significant movement, with the initial group remaining until the store’s closing on the first day. Protesters rapidly increased in number, reaching at least 1,000 within five days, and prompted sit-ins in over 50 cities across nine states. The Greensboro Woolworth counter, approximately 75 miles west of Raleigh, ended segregation within six months.\n\nMcNeil and his classmates “inspired a nation with their courageous, peaceful protest, powerfully embodying the idea that young people could change the world. His leadership and the example of the A&T Four continue to inspire our students today,” school Chancellor James Martin said in a news release.

In November, Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against the network's parent company, Paramount, after Face the Nation aired an interview with his political opponent in the presidential election, Kamala Harris. Trump sought $10 billion and accused CBS News of editing the interview in order to \"tip the scales [of the election] in favor of the Democratic party.\"\n\n Paramount eventually opted to settle the case and agreed to pay Trump $16 million in July. Critics including Sen. Elizabeth Warren and the Writers Guild of America East viewed the decision as an attempt to appease Trump in the midst of the company's then-pending merger with Skydance, which required approval from the Trump administration. The deal was approved later that month, and closed on Aug. 7.\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n Paramount also came under fire for canceling The Late Show With Stephen Colbert three days after the show criticized the CBS News-Trump settlement. Warren suggested that the show was canceled for \"political reasons\" related to the settlement, though the network has consistently stated that pulling the plug on the show was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\"\n\n Additionally, in April, The New York Times reported that longtime 60 Minutes producer Bill Owens resigned from the show.","summary":"Noem criticized the network for editing four minutes out of a 16-minute interview.","url":"https://ew.com/kristi-noem-interview-cbs-news-changes-rules-face-the-nation-11804845","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/OQ318NBMDI4x6mbMnJBN4B5Iuyg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Kristi-Noem-face-the-nation-801-090525-a0ff496b60894020b0a09bf91c800050.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-06 00:49:41","author":"Wesley Stenzel","authors":["Wesley Stenzel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.025},{"id":357842286,"title":"Joseph McNeil, who helped spark a protest movement at a Greensboro lunch counter, dies at 83","text":"GREENSBORO, N.C. -- Joseph McNeil, one of four North Carolina college students whose occupation of a racially segregated Woolworth's lunch counter 65 years ago helped spark nonviolent civil rights sit-in protests across the South, died Thursday, his university said.

Any suggestion that I didn’t is ridiculous and false.”\n\nHowever, a draft memorandum circulated by Biden’s own White House Counsel’s office in February 2024 describing the “general pattern” for obtaining approval for clemency actions appears to contradict Biden’s assertion. The document shows that by the president’s last year in office, he was increasingly relying on Harris’s assessment, rather than his own, in the approval process.\n\n“Note: Given the President’s schedule, it can often take days or weeks for the President to review and approve the clemency package,” a Biden White Hosue lawyers’ memo reads. “The Chief of Staff’s office has been helpful in getting the paper in front of him for his review.”\n\n“He previously asked the White House Counsel to discuss the candidates with him, although in the last round the Vice President’s approval was sufficient to obtain his approval,” the lawyers noted.\n\nThe Trump White House concluded that this memo shows Biden was effectively “outsourcing” clemency decisions to Harris during that final year.\n\nFurther, the Trump Administration’s review found scant contemporaneous evidence that Biden had actually attended four key clemency meetings in the waning months of his term and turned up no record of Biden’s briefing books addressing pardons, commutations, or clemency at that time.\n\nThere were four meetings over December 2024 and January 2025 during which Biden was said to have given “verbal approval” for his wide-ranging clemency actions, including commutations for CARES Act home confinement recipients, federal death row inmates, and crack-powder sentencing disparities, as well as Biden family pardons.\n\nHowever, despite retroactive emails detailing Biden’s presence at the four meetings — which allegedly took place on Dec. 5, December 11, Jan. 11, and Jan. 19 — the National Archives possessed no contemporaneous staff notes from any meeting attendees that could confirm that Biden was present at those meetings or gave verbal approval to those clemency acts.\n\nSupport Free Press Foundation\n\n Report: Memos show Biden outsourced approval of pardons to Harris\n\nReport: Memos show Biden outsourced approval of pardons to Harris added by Editor One on September 5, 2025\n\nView all posts by Editor One →","summary":"by WorldTribune Staff, September 5, 2025 Real World News Joe Biden ignored the pleas of his aides to personally sign official presidential actions and would later outsource decisions on pardons to Kamala Harris, a report said.

The most recent data from 2020 says at least 20 planes make up the executive fleet. A newly constructed plane has not been added in nearly 27 years. Some of the ones currently in service are expected to stay flying for another 13 years. \"They're not building the plane fast enough. I mean, they're actually in default,\" Trump said about Boeing in a February interview with Sean Hannity. Air Force One is used to designate any Air Force aircraft carrying the commander in chief. There are currently two highly customized Boeing aircraft that were deployed in 1990 when George H.W. Bush was president. The planes have since carried Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Trump, Joe Biden and now Trump once again. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO: THE QATAR AIR FORCE ONE JET \"I miss Air Force One,\" Bush said at an event for Veterans in 2014. \"In eight years, they never lost my baggage.\" The two forthcoming Boeing planes have been plagued by delays due to the complex technology needed onboard Air Force One. \"They've got to debug it, make sure there's no signals intelligence risks. And I think just to make it secure against any potential military attacks. It was ironic for a long time. It was one of the Prince's planes, which I think they were trying to sell. And now they're giving it to the U.S., and it's costing quite a bit to update,\" staff writer for the Free Press Jay Solomon said. The Qatari jet is estimated to have a faster timeline than the two Boeing planes, but it still needs some of the same technology to make it Air Force One. \"If you look at it just through economics, maybe it makes sense, but I still think the fact that we're allowing a foreign country to gift something of that magnitude to a sitting president on top of all these other concerns,\" Soloman said. \"I think it's a risk, and it's not a good look.\" Air Force One is required to have four engines, unlike most of today’s passenger planes which have two. Onboard is the highest level of classified communications and external protections against foreign surveillance. The planes are equipped with air-to-air refueling capabilities so they can fly for as long as is needed. Air Force One is built for the worst possible scenarios, like nuclear war, so that the president can still command military forces from the sky. \"They're extremely complex, and I'm not going to go into it, but they're not like a normal plane. You know, it's not like building a 747 normal,\" Trump said during his Middle East Trip on \"Special Report\" in May. TRUMP ACCEPTS JET FROM QATAR, WILL REFIT TO SERVE AS AIR FORCE ONE, DOD SAYS Air Force officials say it is possible to add some of the security features to the Qatari jet, but it's unlikely to have the full suite of technology by Trump's February timeline. \"Initially it was supposed to be like, maybe he'll get it done by the end of his presidency,\" Solomon said. Four modified Boeing 757s or C-32As are the newest planes in the executive fleet. Those were added in 1998 and 1999. The Air Force is studying potential replacement options, but the current planes will continue to fly until 2038. The aircraft are primarily used by the vice president, Cabinet members, members of Congress and other officials. \"Even today and regardless of the airplane, we have to operate it differently based on the threat environment that even the current or any of the future aircraft will go into. Again, can't talk in detail about that, but that is always a consideration,\" Air Force Secretary Troy Meink said during a June Senate Hearing. Air Force One isn’t the only aging plane; much of the executive fleet is more than two decades old. The aircraft have undergone modernization modifications, but officials have questioned the timeline for major updates as several incidents have taken place over the years. INSIDE AMERICA’S 6TH-GEN ARSENAL: B-21, F-47, AND THE FUTURE OF AIR DOMINANCE In 2014, Obama was forced to switch planes during a campaign event in Philadelphia after a minor mechanical problem was reported on Air Force One. In 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris' plane requested an emergency return to Joint Base Andrews as she began her first foreign trip overseas to Guatemala and Mexico. Most recently, Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s plane was forced to turn around while en route to Munich in February, after a mechanical issue. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The newest aircraft among the executive fleet are the Marine One Helicopters. Biden first rode in the newly designed Marine One in 2024 during the Democratic National Convention. Updating those took nearly two decades and in some cases replaced helicopters flying since the 1970s. The Boeing 777X is expected to be the next new major commercial aircraft. It’s scheduled to enter service in 2026 after a nearly six-year delay with Lufthansa taking the first flight. The modernized plane is designed to have a folding wingtip, a touchscreen flight deck and wider cabin space.","summary":"Air Force One fleet faces aging aircraft issues as Boeing delays delivery of new presidential planes by years, prompting consideration of a Qatari jet alternative.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/closer-look-air-force-one-executive-fleet","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/09/donald-trump-air-force-one.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6378547597112","publish_date":"2025-09-05 23:11:42","author":"Amy Munneke,Bret Baier","authors":["Amy Munneke","Bret Baier"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":357839454,"title":"Joseph McNeil dies at 83; civil rights activist helped spark a protest movement at a North Carolina lunch counter","text":"By Gary D.

process that saw the news network sued by then-presidential candidate Donald Trump in late 2024. \n\nAt the time, Trump accused CBS News of “deceitful” editing of a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President and then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nThe network reached a $16 million settlement and issued no statement of apology or regret for the 60 Minutes interview with Harris.\n\nAdditionally, the network agreed to release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after the interviews have aired, with the ability to add redactions for legal or national security concerns.\n\nSettling the case was reportedly a top priority for former Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone, who sought to complete the long-anticipated sale to Skydance Media. \n\nHowever, the process of reaching that settlement came with the departures of two key 60 Minutes executives: Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS News and Stations, and CBS Media Ventures, and Bill Owens, the longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes.\n\nThe settlement, the departures of senior leadership, and the news that Skydance Media will install an ombudsman to review “complaints of bias or other concerns” and ensure “viewpoint diversity” at CBS News helped see through the merger.\n\nDespite Paramount CEO David Ellison’s public support of CBS News, this latest policy change to its Sunday public affairs program adds to the uncertainty around what the news organization looks like moving forward.","summary":"CBS News Face the Nation to Air Interviews

German authorities have characterized the deaths as coincidental—resulting from natural causes, pre-existing conditions, or not disclosed for privacy reasons—asserting no signs of foul play. However, the context of these occurrences, set in a political environment where the AfD is deemed an extremist threat by the establishment, makes them seem anything but coincidental. Skeptics highlight the statistical anomaly: Seven deaths among around 3,000 candidates, primarily focusing on one anti-establishment party ascending in the polls.\n\nThe AfD stands firm against globalist agendas: advocating for reinforced borders to curb unregulated migration, halting boundless aid to Ukraine’s ongoing conflict, restarting nuclear reactors closed due to environmental policies, and terminating wind energy projects that have disrupted industries and increased energy expenses. These are not fringe opinions; they challenge the EU-Brussels consensus that prioritizes open borders and interventionist policies over national concerns.\n\nAccording to BBC reports, which detail the deaths and logistical issues like reprinting ballots in affected districts, authorities emphasize the incidents are legitimate and above suspicion. The Hungarian Conservative examines one case, underscoring a prompt non-criminal verdict despite the suspect context. Yet, as the AfD attempts to triple its vote share in NRW—testing their strength post-federal elections—these occurrences disrupt operations and spark questions. This situation is reminiscent of cartel-driven assassinations in Mexico’s 2024 elections, where dissenting voices were silenced. Independent journalists raise serious concerns, pondering if voicing opposition carries lethal risks.\n\nDetails from Main Sources\n\nThe deaths transpired in NRW, where the AfD put forward over 3,000 candidates for the September 14 local elections. Authorities claim no links between the cases, citing natural or personal causes without external involvement. Here’s a factual summary sourced from available reports:\n\nRalph Lange, age 66 or 67, location unspecified in NRW: Sudden and unexpected death, ruled natural causes.\nWolfgang Seitz, age 59, location unspecified: Sudden death, official cause natural.\nWolfgang Klinger, age 71 or 72, location unspecified: Unexpected natural causes.\nStefan Berendes, age not detailed (likely mid-50s to 60s based on patterns), location unspecified: Sudden death, natural.\nRené Herford, age not specified, reserve candidate: Died of kidney failure following a pre-existing liver condition.\nPatrick Tietze, age not specified, reserve: Reported suicide.\nHans-Joachim Kind, age 80, from Kremenholl in southern Remscheid: Natural causes after a long illness.\n\nThese incidents occurred from late August to early September 2025, with the first four announced around September 1, followed by two alternates and the seventh shortly afterwards. While some involved older individuals or those with known health problems, critics note that several—such as Seitz, aged 59—weren’t elderly or previously sick, challenging easy rationalizations.\n\nThe BBC offers additional context: Police investigated the initial four deaths and found no foul play, mentioning similar fatalities in other parties (six involving the Greens and Social Democrats post-nomination). Though the AfD’s grouping is noteworthy, particularly as the party—labeled right-wing extremist by domestic intelligence—gains traction in western Germany. Polls predict a leap to 16-17% in NRW, a significant increase from 5.4% in the 2022 state elections. Skepticism in German media, including Welt, mirrors online discussions, with AfD co-leader Alice Weidel endorsing claims of statistical improbability. The outlet acknowledges no evidence connecting the deaths but recognizes the peculiarity.\n\nThe Hungarian Conservative focuses on Kind’s case, detailing how authorities quickly ruled it non-criminal, emphasizing his long illness as explanation. Deputy AfD chairman Kay Gottschalk urged probes but warned against conspiracy theories, respecting families. The piece notes the deaths exceed norms—seven among 250 key candidates in weeks—and highlights AfD’s surveillance by intelligence services, adding tension. No direct ties to threats, but the pattern benefits establishment parties like the ruling coalition, which could retain control amid disruptions.\n\nElection fallout is real: Ballots must be reprinted in impacted areas, postal votes recast, creating “immense chaos” per reports. This could suppress turnout or delay results, favoring incumbents in a state of 18 million where AfD’s anti-migration stance resonates. While officials downplay, the concentration raises questions about whether these “natural” ends conveniently sideline challengers.\n\nParallel to Mexico’s Elections\n\nThe AfD’s string of deaths draws stark parallels to Mexico’s 2024 elections, where a record 38 candidates were assassinated in the bloodiest campaign on record. Reuters detailed how violence, largely tied to drug cartels, targeted local politicians—often opposition figures—leading up to the June vote. The final tally included 37 murders, with the last, Jorge Huerta Cabrera in Puebla, shot at a rally. Government efforts to protect 560 candidates fell short amid 828 non-lethal aggressions, and officials often minimized patterns as isolated incidents.\n\nSimilarities abound: In both, anti-establishment voices face elimination before polls, with authorities downplaying systemic threats. Mexico’s killings served cartel interests intertwined with global drug networks and porous borders—much like how Germany’s open migration policies benefit elite agendas. Opposition platforms were hit hardest, echoing AfD’s border-sealing push against mass influxes. Official responses in Mexico echoed Germany’s: Blame coincidences or personal issues, not foul play. The facts imply a pattern: Neutralize dissent to preserve the system, whether via bullets in cartel-riddled Mexico or “sudden” ends in surveillance-heavy Germany.\n\nIndependent Analysis: Redacted’s Reporting\n\nOn Redacted, hosts Clayton and Natalie Morris dissected the AfD deaths with German journalist Naomi Seibt, offering a raw counter to mainstream gloss-overs. Clayton kicked off: “Seven members of the German right-wing AfD party suddenly dropped dead… German authorities say these are just coincidental non-criminal deaths.” He tied it to the party’s anti-globalist bent—sealing borders, ending Ukraine aid, restarting nuclear, ditching green schemes—right before elections.\n\nSeibt called the timing “very off,” rejecting legacy media’s “conspiracy theories” label: “Seven AfD candidates within the span of a few weeks. Something is very off here.” She dismissed pre-existing conditions excuses, noting even if some were 60-plus, the cluster doesn’t add up: “If I maybe eat one Big Mac today and then I drop dead tomorrow, that means I had a pre-existing condition?” Comparing to COVID stats abuse, she argued these deaths are “way more unexpected” than manipulated pandemic figures.\n\nOn AfD’s rise, Seibt said they were “definitely headed for a win,” though not superstar candidates. Leaders like Alice Weidel face death threats—canceling events over bomb fears—making the party a prime target: “Why didn’t nobody try to kill somebody like Kamala Harris? That’s because obviously she was not as much of a target.” Strategic hits on lesser-knowns avoid backlash while disrupting.\n\nSeibt dissected rumors, like a syringe incident causing illness: “That’s not normal, that’s not a natural cause.” She urged investigations, respectfully, as crucial: “At the very least investigate what’s actually going on.” As gaslighting example, she detailed 16-year-old Ukrainian Liana’s murder—pushed onto tracks by Iraqi migrants—but initially called an accident. Media smeared AfD probes as racist until truth emerged: “They tried to brainwash every single one of us.”\n\nSeibt revealed intelligence surveillance on AfD, wiretapping phones, raiding homes—including herself on watch lists: “It’s worse than what we’ve lived through in East Germany,” per survivors. Natalie questioned government credibility, citing the Navalny poisoning fabrication: “They made up this crazy circumstance… to vilify Putin.” Now, they’re “ignoring suspicious circumstances.” Seibt agreed: “I don’t care what the government says,” pushing for oversight like family access. She feared escalations: With raids on AfD’s Peter Bystron over baseless Russia claims and candidate bans, “maybe they will resort to different tools and potentially even consider killing them silently.”\n\nClayton probed locales’ strategic value: Pivotal for AfD majorities? Seibt noted early days but gains in key areas, warning more could follow if bans fail.\n\nWhat They’re Saying on X\n\nNaomi Seibt: “🚨🇩🇪 7 AfD MEMBERS JUST DlED – ALICE WEIDEL WARNED US‼️😳 AfD candidates are the targets of intelligence espionage, lawfare, hoax trials, election bans. Tyranny has kiIIed democracy. And now… AfD candidates too? Do you believe it was a coincidence?” Her post ties deaths to systemic attacks, urging scrutiny amid AfD threats. \nPunishable Press: “”Statistically Impossible” 7 AFD candidates die before local elections in Germany.” The account highlights improbability, with a video fueling discussions on patterns and media silence. \nDisclose.tv: “NEW – AfD party has recorded six deaths among its politicians within a short period of time in the run-up to the upcoming local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany — Welt” with update: “UPDATE – Number of deceased AfD candidates rises to seven — Welt.” Their neutral reporting sparks replies comparing to Mexico and accusing foul play.\n\nUnanswered questions linger: Why only AfD in this death wave? Why no deeper probes? Despite surveillance and smears, the party endures, embodying populist grit against elite pressures. Transparent investigations are vital—no lectures, just accountability.\n\nIn a time of globalist wars siphoning resources and borders erased for cheap labor, AfD’s push for sovereignty threatens the machine. That’s why they’re targeted: Real change gets crushed to sustain interventions and open societies. Ditch legacy media; track independents for unvarnished truth.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWeeks before local elections in North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany’s most populous state,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Unexplained Deaths of AfD Candidates Prior to Local Elections first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/unexplained-deaths-of-afd-candidates-prior-to-local-elections/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mysterious-Deaths-of-AfD-Candidates-Before-Local-Elections.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 21:11:06","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":357838324,"title":"Trump’s New Labor Stats Guy is a Jan 6 ‘Bystander’ Accused of Unhinged Posts","text":"President Trump recently fired Erika McEntarfer, the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusing her of having “rigged” job reports. In her place, Trump has selected E.J. Antoni, a former Heritage Foundation economist who was photographed at the January 6th debacle (but who claims he was just a “bystander” to the chaos) and who, according to reports from CNN and Wired, formerly ran a Twitter account that posted all sorts of gnarly stuff.\n\nEarlier this month, Wired reported that a since-deleted Twitter account with the same name as Antoni (it went by “Dr. Erwin J. Antoni III”) had posted a flurry of tweets that displayed a “seeming obsession with promoting election denial conspiracy theories while talking about violent threats to those who stood in Trump’s way.” Wired also noted that the account posted “violent religious rhetoric” and, before the Capitol riot, “shared content from The Donald, a virulently pro-Trump message board that was used to organize the events of Jan 6, 2021.” The account is characterized as having been “infused with a deeply hardline Catholic worldview, [and] at times displayed misogyny and a knowledge of Nazi military techniques.”\n\nSurveillance footage has definitively confirmed that Antoni was at the January 6th riots. The White House previously defended Antoni’s presence, claiming he was “a bystander to the events of January 6th, observing and then leaving the Capitol area.” The White House also previously noted: “EJ was in town for meetings, and it is wrong and defamatory to suggest EJ engaged in anything inappropriate or illegal.” There’s no evidence Antoni entered the Capitol, and the footage available shows him milling through the crowd and, eventually, leaving the grounds, NBC reports.\n\nCNN now has a new report out about Antoni’s alleged Twitter account that states he posted degrading sexual content about Kamala Harris, apparently implying that her political career was the result of blowjobs:\n\nIn 2019, the since-deleted account known as “ErwinJohnAntoni” changed its username to “phdofbombsaway.” The account posted at least five sexually suggestive tweets implying that then Sen. Kamala Harris had advanced her career through sexual favors. Shortly after Harris ended her 2020 presidential campaign, Antoni wrote, “You can’t run a race on your knees,” in response to a tweet of a doctored campaign poster that depicted a sexually explicit image of Harris. Antoni also referred to Christine Blasey Ford, the woman who accused Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexual assault, as “Miss Piggy.” In February 2020, he retweeted a post titled “Advice For Women: How To Land a Great Guy,” which instructed women to “be in shape,” “grow your hair long,” “be sweet,” “learn to cook,” and “don’t be annoying.” The post concluded: “Angry feminists and simps will try to sabotage you in the comments. Don’t listen to them. Listen to me.”\n\nSuch sweet advice from “ErwinJohn”—jeez any woman would be lucky to have a classy guy like that. The same account reportedly used the handle “Dr. Curtis LeMay,” in apparent reference to the U.S. Air Force’s notoriously psychotic general who oversaw the bombing of Japan in WWII.\n\nWhen reached for comment, the White House didn’t address the allegations about past social media posts, merely providing the following statement from spokeswoman Taylor Rogers:\n\n“The BLS was failing America’s businesses, policymakers, and families by publishing jobs reports with vastly inaccurate data. This has gone on for years without any real attempt at resolution while Wall Street and Main Street’s frustration with the BLS continued to grow. President Trump has nominated Dr. EJ Antoni to fix the issues at the BLS and restore trust in the jobs reports. Dr. Antoni has the experience and credentials needed to restore solution-oriented leadership at the BLS — solutions that will prioritize increasing survey response rates and modernizing data collection methods to improve the BLS’s accuracy.”\n\nGizmodo also reached out to the Labor Department and the Heritage Foundation for comment.\n\nIt’s no wonder that Trump wants someone with a different perspective to report on the economy right now. Many analysts see a slowly unraveling fiscal outlook with America’s jobs market in free fall. The Bureau of Labor Statistics report published on Friday showed that hiring in the U.S. had stalled, with just 22,000 jobs added in August. That’s significantly lower than what analysts had projected, which was some 80,000 jobs, the Associated Press notes. Some commentators feel that it is Trump’s policies—in particular, his tariffs—that have rattled companies and kept their hiring practices conservative.","summary":"Two different reports claim Trump's new labor statistics guru ran a social media account that routinely posted bigoted content.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/trumps-new-labor-stats-nominee-was-a-jan-6-bystander-accused-of-making-unhinged-posts-2000654659","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/Trump-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 21:05:16","author":"Lucas Ropek","authors":["Lucas Ropek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.248},{"id":357839628,"title":"Trump-Supporting Muslim Mayor Halts English/Arabic Police Department Patch","text":"The mayor of Dearborn Heights, Michigan, said the Detroit suburb’s police department jumped the gun on posting a mockup of an optional patch in English and Arabic three days ago, explaining it should never have been presented as official.\n\nThe Dearborn Heights Police Department announced in a Facebook post earlier this week it was going to be offering its officers the optional patch that had “Dearborn Heights” and “Police” written in both languages — believed to be the first of its kind in the country.\n\nBut that post has now been removed, with Dearborn Heights Mayor Bill Bazzi — nominated by President Trump to a North African ambassadorship — saying not so fast on the proposed alteration to the local police uniform.\n\nIt was not “put forth for consensus for further review,” Detroit’s Fox affiliate quotes the mayor as saying.\n\n“Should efforts like this be formally undertaken to make any changes to the Police uniform, it is our goal to include multiple PD stakeholders for a larger conversation, to ensure all are included in the discussion,” Bazzi said. “As we are one PD, each individual’s uniform represents the DHPD as a whole, and therefore merits the review and input of all.”\n\nThe police department wrote in its original statement on Facebook that the patch was designed by one of its officers, adding, “Our officers proudly serve all members of our community, and this new design is another way we continue to celebrate the rich cultures that make our city unique.”\n\nHowever, it should never have been offered as “an official prototype,” Bazzi, who was born in Lebanon and is the city’s first Muslim mayor, said.\n\nThe patch generated thousands of comments on Facebook, many of them in opposition, including one local man who posted, “we’ve lost the city.”\n\nDearborn Heights’ Middle Eastern and North African population was 39% as of 2023. In neighboring Dearborn that number is roughly 55%.\n\nPresident Donald Trump won both those cities in the 2024 election by eight and six-point margins over Vice President Kamala Harris. He actively sought out Arab and Muslim support while campaigning as a “peace candidate” in Michigan.\n\nOne of those who backed Trump was Mayor Bazzi, who the president earlier this year appointed as the United States ambassador to Tunisia, an Arab country with a population of some 12.3 million.\n\nBazzi just had his confirmation hearing in Washington Wednesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which now is expected to go to full Senate confirmation.\n\nBazzi, 62, is a classic American success story. He came to the U.S. at 12 from Lebanon with no formal education and went on to serve 21 years in the U.S. Marines, later earning aeronautical engineering degrees and working in positions for Boeing and Ford Motor Company.\n\nDespite the apparent mix-up over the patch, Bazzi told the local Fox affiliate he was proud of the police department’s efforts in the community.\n\nContributor Lowell Cauffiel is the best-selling author of Below the Line and nine other crime novels and nonfiction titles.

FACE THE NATION will now only broadcast live or live-to-tape interviews (subject to national security or legal restrictions). This extra measure means the television audience will see the full, unedited interview on CBS and we will continue our practice of posting full transcripts and the unedited video online,” CBS News said in a statement. (RELATED: CBS Quietly Edits Harris Word Salad Response In ’60 Minutes’ Interview)\n\nNoem accused CBS News on Sunday of having “shamefully edited” her interview to “whitewash the truth” about Garcia, an individual whom many Democrats and members of the media have staunchly defended. The DHS secretary referred to Garcia as a “known human smuggler, an MS-13 gang member, an individual who was a wife beater, and someone who was so perverted that he solicited nude photos from minors.”\n\n This morning, I joined CBS to report the facts about Kilmar Abrego Garcia.

Garcia illegally entered the U.S. in 2011 from El Salvador and has since been at the center of a highly contentious deportation case.\n\nCBS News’ change followed their $36 million settlement with President Donald Trump after he accused them of deceptively editing a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to bolster her chances in the 2024 election. As part of the settlement, the network dedicated around $16 million to fund Trump’s future presidential library and agreed to release the written transcripts of future “60 Minutes” interviews with presidential candidates.\n\nThe administration facilitated Garcia’s return in June for him to face human smuggling charges. After being released and then immediately taken back into custody by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), an Obama-appointed federal judge in Maryland blocked the administration from deporting Garcia on Aug. 26.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Rick Scott: 'Socialism NEVER Works'","text":"“Socialism NEVER works,” Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL) said this week, standing up to the rise of socialism in areas such as New York City as it looks to elect a socialist mayor.\n\n“It’s destroyed countries, crushed economies and robbed millions of their basic human rights,” the Florida senator said on social media upon leading a resolution condemning this failed ideology.\n\nThe resolution formally centers around “denouncing the horrors of socialism” and lists several examples of these horrors, including but not limited to the ideology resulting in “a concentration of power that has, time and time again, collapsed into communist regimes, totalitarian rule, and brutal dictatorships.”\n\nThe resolution also highlights socialism leading to famine and mass murders, resulting in the death of millions upon millions of people.\n\n“Whereas many of the greatest crimes in history were committed by socialist ideologues, including Vladimir Lenin, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro, Pol Pot, Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un, Daniel Ortega, Hugo Chavez, and Nicolas Maduro; Whereas tens of millions died in the Bolshevik Revolution, at least 10,000,000 people were sent to the gulags in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and millions more starved in the Terror-Famine (Holodomor) in Ukraine,” it continues, also highlighting millions dying in North Korea because of this ideology.\n\nFurther, the resolution points to the Castro regime in Cuba and how it decimated Cuban farmers and the businesses of Cuban entrepreneurs, “stealing their possessions and their livelihoods, and exiling millions with nothing but the clothes on their backs.” It also points out that socialism turned Venezuela — “a once-prosperous country into a failed State with the highest rate of inflation in the world.”\n\nScott also cites the founding fathers, who warned against this ideology:\n\nWhereas President Thomas Jefferson, the author of the Declaration of Independence, wrote, ‘‘To take from one, because it is thought that his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who, or whose fathers have not exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to every one of a free exercise of his industry, and the fruits acquired by it’’;\nWhereas President James Madison, the ‘‘Father of the Constitution’’, wrote that it ‘‘is not a just government, nor is property secure under it, where the property which a man has in his personal safety and personal liberty, is violated by arbitrary seizures of one class of citizens for the service of the rest’’; and Whereas the United States was founded on the belief in the sanctity of the individual, to which the collectivistic system of socialism in all of its forms is fundamentally and necessarily opposed.\n\n“Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That Congress denounces socialism in all its forms, and opposes the implementation of socialist policies in the United States,” the resolution concludes.\n\nDespite some Democrats attempting to distance themselves from their socialist counterparts, Americans should remember that former Vice President Kamala Harris herself pushed socialism just days before the 2020 presidential election, making her leftist political ideology crystal clear.\n\nAs Breitbart News reported:\n\nOn November 1, 2020, Harris posted a video showing the difference between “equality” and “equity,” with the caption, “There’s a big difference between equality and equity.”\nHarris, seemingly narrating the video, begins, “So, there’s a big difference between equality and equity. Equality suggests, ‘Oh, everyone should get the same amount.’ The problem with that [is] not everybody’s starting out from the same place.” As she says that, the video shows an illustration of two individuals — one light-skinned and the other dark-skinned — about to climb a mountain. Each is given a rope, which the seemingly white man uses to begin climbing. The other man, who appears to be black, is unable to reach the rope, starting a few feet lower than the white man even though he is given the same amount of rope.\n“So, if we’re all getting the same amount but you started out back there and I started out over here, we could get the same amount, but you’re still gonna be that far back behind me,” Harris says as the illustration shows the white man climbing and the black man looking up at him, far behind.\n\n“Equitable treatment means we all end up at the same place,” Harris concluded.\n\nThis resolution comes as Scott has continued to publicly defend capitalism in the face of socialists like Zohran Mamdani, as Republicans — more broadly speaking — mock Democrats for taking their “wildly unpopular” proposals as a plan to reclaim a House majority.","summary":"\"Socialism NEVER works,\" Sen.

This memorandum provides a proposed update of prior Autopen guidelines that YOU approved during Transition.”\n\nThe document specifically lists “pardon letters” under the category of documents for which Biden should not use the autopen, “Documents for YOUR Consideration, Approval, and Original Hand Signature,” citing precedent set by former President Barack Obama.\n\nA second memo, circulated within the White House Counsel in February 2024, noted that by that point in Biden’s presidency, then-Vice President Kamala Harris and Counsel to the Vice President Erica Songer had become involved in the clemency approval process.\n\n“Before a decision memo is transmitted to the President, the Vice President has previously requested to review the petitioners individually and has raised detailed questions with the WHCO clemency team. This has also introduced significant, unexpected delays. Therefore, planning for the Vice President’s individual review of candidates would likely help expedite the process,” the memo reads. “Given the President’s schedule, it can often take days or weeks for the President to review and approve the clemency package. The Chief of Staff’s Office has been helpful in getting the paper in front of him for his review. He has previously asked the White House Counsel to discuss the candidates with him, although in the last round the Vice President’s approval was sufficient to obtain his approval.”\n\nOver the summer, President Donald Trump ordered that the White House Counsel pursue a separate investigation into Biden’s use of an autopen to sign thousands of clemency actions during his final weeks in office, including preemptive pardons for members of his family and several political allies.\n\nThe White House Counsel investigation follows separate lines of investigation opened by the Department of Justice and the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Trump White House and Biden’s post-presidential office did not return requests for comment on the aforementioned memos.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY), who is leading House Republicans’ investigation into Biden’s autopen pardons, told the Washington Examiner that these memos “reveal President Biden neither approved — nor may have even been consulted on — thousands of pardons.”\n\nThe Oversight Committee has been moving quickly through an investigation into Biden’s inner circle and how it enabled his use of the autopen. The committee has conducted 12 interviews thus far, with two more on the books, as it looks into whether Biden’s inner circle hid his alleged mental decline from the public by exercising presidential power in his name without his full understanding or consent.\n\nThe committee has expanded the investigation since the release of Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson’s book, Original Sin. Comer has questioned the former president’s use of the autopen for pardons and executive orders and whether his aides covered up his cognitive decline.\n\n“This is a historic scandal with massive repercussions. As President Biden declined, his aides carried out executive actions without his approval, casting doubt on the legitimacy of thousands of pardons and other executive actions,” Comer said. “The House Oversight Committee is in the final stages of its investigation. There must be accountability for this scandal.”\n\nThe government investigations into Biden’s autopen use were launched following the publication of a report from the Oversight Project, a watchdog group formerly part of the Heritage Foundation, that detailed how widespread Biden’s use of the autopen was.\n\nOversight Project chief counsel Kyle Brosnan told the Washington Examiner that the memos obtained by the Trump White House “confirm our fundamental thesis that President Biden was not running the country during his tenure in the White House.”\n\n“The pardon power rests solely with the President, and these new records show that the President was not the person exercising that power,” he continued. “They’re not legal pardons and should be thrown out.”","summary":"Former President Joe Biden’s senior staff initially recommended that he personally approve and sign by hand presidential clemency actions, but near the end of his term, Biden broke from that guidance, according to documents reportedly unearthed by a Trump White House investigation.

The surprise announcement comes on the heels of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem accusing CBS News of editing her interview Sunday to \"whitewash the truth\" about an alleged MS-13 gang member. It also arrives months after the company settled President Donald Trump’s \"election interference\" lawsuit in July that accused CBS News of deceptive editing. \"In response to audience feedback over the past week, we have implemented a new policy for greater transparency in our interviews. ‘Face the Nation’ will now only broadcast live or live-to-tape interviews (subject to national security or legal restrictions). This extra measure means the television audience will see the full, unedited interview on CBS, and we will continue our practice of posting full transcripts and the unedited video online,\" a CBS News spokesperson told Fox News Digital. KRISTI NOEM ACCUSES CBS NEWS OF ‘SHAMEFULLY’ EDITING HER INTERVIEW ABOUT KILMAR ABREGO GARCIA On Sunday, Noem blasted CBS after her interview aired on \"Face the Nation.\" \"I joined CBS to report the facts about Kilmar Abrego Garcia. Instead, CBS shamefully edited the interview to whitewash the truth about this MS-13 gang member and the threat he poses to American public safety,\" Noem wrote alongside video clips to back up her point. In the clip that aired on television, Noem said, \"Prosecution decisions are always made by the Department of Justice and Pam Bondi’s department, so we will let them do that, although this individual does have criminal charges pending. He has charges pending against him civilly as well. And the one thing that we will continue to do is to make sure that he doesn’t walk free in the United States of America.\" The on-air portion edited out the rest of her answer and went to moderator Ed O’Keefe’s next question about whether the government would still seek to deport him to Uganda. Noem posted her \"uncut response\" online, noting it was excluded from the broadcast. The full interview, however, remained available on the show’s YouTube page. CBS NEWS INSIDERS BRACE FOR BARI WEISS AS PARAMOUNT CEO PUSHES DEAL WORTH UP TO $200M \"This individual was a known human smuggler, an MS-13 gang member, and an individual who is a wife beater, and someone who is so perverted that he solicited nude photos from minors and even his fellow human traffickers told him to knock it off. He was so sick in what he was doing and how he was treating small children. So, he needs to never be in the United States of America, and our administration is making sure we’re doing all that we can,\" Noem said. At the time, CBS insisted the process met the network's standards. \"Secretary Noem’s 'Face the Nation' interview was edited for time and met all CBS News standards,\" a CBS News spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Monday. PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP As for the Trump settlement, the president was seeking $20 billion in his lawsuit against CBS over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of election interference leading up to the 2024 contest. The lawsuit alleged CBS News edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on \"Face the Nation.\" However, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of editing Harris' answer to shield the Democratic nominee from backlash leading up to Election Day. Trump agreed to receive $16 million upfront to cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes. The president has said another allocation in the eight figures has been set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future.

And nowhere is that more visible than in the collapse of legacy media’s stranglehold on American journalism.\n\nThe gatekeepers are in retreat.\n\nGone are the days of an adversarial press dictating the narrative to the American people.\n\nTaking their place are a legion of new and emboldened media outlets, social media influencers, and just about anyone with a smartphone and internet connection.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, we’re witnessing a massive disruption in the media landscape.\n\nIt’s a beautiful thing to watch, and a hopeful sign that after years of playing defense, we’re now on offense—and winning.\n\nMany of the changes happening today were unthinkable prior to President Donald Trump’s return to the White House.\n\nThe Media Counterrevolution\n\nI liken it to what Victor Davis Hanson brilliantly describes as a counterrevolution—one in which President Trump is addressing the causes, not just the symptoms, of the progressive project.\n\nHanson calls this counterrevolution an effort to “erase the Left’s long march through our institutions.”\n\nThat long march went right through American newsrooms—just as it did in academia and Hollywood. Today’s legacy media is wholly owned and operated by the Left. They stifle conservative viewpoints—if they even give us any airtime.\n\nThis march began long ago, and it’s chronicled in detail by Batya Ungar-Sargon in her excellent book “Bad News: How Woke Media Is Undermining Democracy.”\n\nIt might be hard to believe now, but newsrooms were at one time staffed by blue-collar workers who lived among those they covered. They focused on stories of interest to their community, not to the affluent and elite.\n\nBut over the course of the 20th century, American journalism changed for the worse. It became an elite profession, one that catered primarily to liberals and advanced woke ideas.\n\nReporters and editors who might have in the past entered the workforce with a high school degree were replaced by esteemed journalists from elite Ivy League institutions.\n\nAs they rose through the ranks of newsrooms, they hired their friends and others just like them. Working-class journalists were weeded out in favor of people who had degrees from Columbia Journalism School or Medill.\n\nJournalism schools that at one time existed to teach students the trade became indoctrination factories for impressionable young minds.\n\nI know because I witnessed this firsthand as a journalism major in college. As a freshman, my Intro to Journalism professor began the very first class by advocating for an activist form of journalism—one that supported left-wing causes, of course.\n\nThis was a familiar pattern throughout my four years in journalism school. Even a course called Alternative Media focused on only one type of alternative—media catering to the far Left.\n\nThe message was clear: Think like one of us, and you’ll be rewarded with a successful career.\n\nGeneration after generation of students viewed media through this leftist lens. Today, these Gen Xers and Millennials populate newsrooms across America.\n\nSome are even leading the media companies that despise President Trump and seek to undermine the traditional American values we cherish.\n\nAnd yet despite this, I stand before you today with good news. Conservatives have successfully challenged the status quo—and we are succeeding.\n\nThe Collapse of Media Trust\n\nThe numbers tell a devastating story about legacy media’s credibility crisis. Here are just a few from Gallup:\n\nOnly 31% of Americans now trust the media “a great deal” or “a fair amount.”\n\nThirty-six percent have no trust at all—up from just 6% in 1972.\n\nAmong Republicans, a staggering 59% have zero trust in mass media.\n\nLegacy media have lost sight of their role of informing Americans in favor of lecturing them.\n\nAs a result, the gatekeepers have lost their gate and lost touch with the country, and at times, reality.\n\nFor years, a media monopoly of left-wing journalists occupied coveted spots in the White House, Pentagon, and on Capitol Hill—asking questions that advanced their agenda, often at the expense of the truth.\n\nTrump tried to disrupt things in his first term—but this time, he’s not backing down. And he’s doing so with committed warriors like press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr by his side.\n\nJust think about the remarkable changes we have witnessed this year.\n\nAfter years of hearing Republicans promise to defund PBS and NPR, it finally happened. The nearly 60-year-old Corporation for Public Broadcasting, funded with your tax dollars, announced it was shutting down.\n\nThe long-troubled U.S. Agency for Global Media, which is supposed to support freedom and democracy throughout the world but instead undermined American values, is a shell of its former self.\n\nWith those changes, the government finally exited the media business.\n\nIn the private sector, the counterrevolution is bringing changes unimaginable a year ago.\n\nStephen Colbert, the late-night host who spews nothing but hatred for President Trump, will be without a job after CBS canceled his show and permanently ended “The Late Show.”\n\nCBS’ new parent company, Skydance, made several eye-catching promises in its bid to acquire CBS’ parent company Paramount. These were outlined in letters sent to Chairman Carr in July. It would:\n\nUndertake a “comprehensive review of CBS.”\n\nEnsure that CBS’ reporting is “fair, unbiased, and fact-based.”\n\nRecognize the importance of “unbiased journalism.”\n\nEliminate diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives.\n\nCommit to a “diverse array of viewpoints.”\n\nFeature viewpoints from “across the political and ideological spectrum.”\n\nAnd have an ombudsman for two years.\n\nNow, it’ll be up to all of us to make sure those promises are fulfilled, but it’s still a remarkable admission to put in writing.\n\nAt MSNBC, Joy Reid lost her job and Rachel Maddow railed at her employer and then lost her staff to layoffs.\n\nLester Holt announced his retirement as anchor of NBC Nightly News.\n\nSenior National Correspondent Terry Moran went on a social media rant about White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller then found himself fired by ABC News. He then turned around and accused the network of “failing the American people” for not attacking President Trump more vigorously.\n\nWashington Post owner Jeff Bezos said the editorial page would focus on personal liberties and free markets, prompting editor David Shipley to quit on the spot. The Post lost 75,000 subscribers over that change alone.\n\nA few months later, notorious Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler left the paper, along with dozens of other longtime employees.\n\nThe Associated Press was barred from the Oval Office and Air Force One over its politicized stylebook and refusal to call the Gulf of America by its proper name.\n\nThe Pentagon replaced NBC News, The New York Times, NPR, and Politico in its press corridor with the New York Post, Breitbart News, One America News, and HuffPost.\n\nOn the flip side, Google’s YouTubeTV signed a multiyear deal to carry One America News.\n\nNewsmax started trading on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nFox News acquired Red Seat Ventures, which represents Tucker Carlson and other popular conservative hosts. A few months later, Fox struck a licensing deal with the popular conservative podcast Ruthless.\n\nI could certainly go on and on, but I’ll end my list with this—perhaps the most surprising news of all: ABC paid President Trump $15 million to settle a defamation case, CBS paid him $16 million to settle a lawsuit over Kamala Harris’ heavily edited “60 Minutes” interview, and Meta forked over $25 million after censoring the president’s social media accounts.\n\nYou’re hearing cries of self-censorship, complaints of a “fascist takeover,” and comparisons to “Kremlin suppression.” But the truth is simpler: They’re losing their power, and they can’t stand it.\n\nA Return to Common Sense\n\nSo how did this happen?\n\nFirst, we must give credit to our conservative forefathers. Without visionaries like William F. Buckley at National Review or M. Stanton Evans at the National Journalism Center, we wouldn’t have the infrastructure or the talent to challenge the Left.\n\nAnd without Rush Limbaugh starting his talk-radio show in the 1980s, Heritage Foundation President Ed Feulner helping to launch Townhall.com in the 1990s, or countless bloggers charting new frontiers in the 2000s, we wouldn’t be nearly as persuasive or influential as we are today.\n\nBut it took a fighter like Donald Trump to shake the establishment to its core.\n\nWhat Trump represents—and what we in conservative media represent—is a counterrevolution to restore normalcy and bring the country back from the far-left fringes. It’s a return to common sense.\n\nLet me rewind to the 2024 presidential campaign for a moment.\n\nDonald Trump set the tone for what you’re seeing now by skipping traditional stops at places like “60 Minutes.”\n\nInstead, he spent time golfing with pro golfer and YouTube influencer Bryson DeChambeau and hanging out with major YouTubers and podcasters Andrew Schulz, Theo Von, Logan Paul, and the guys from the “All-In Podcast.”\n\nAnd let’s not forget the granddaddy of them all, Joe Rogan, whose interview with Trump now sits at nearly 60 million views on YouTube alone.\n\nTrump did 14 of these podcast interviews, racking up a total of 124 million views by Election Day.\n\nMeanwhile, Kamala Harris did just five podcast interviews for a grand total of 4 million views.\n\nTrump bypassed the gatekeepers and spoke directly to the American people. They couldn’t distort his answers, splice his soundbites, or manipulate his words.\n\nAnd what happened? Americans saw a different side of Trump.\n\nConservative Media Rising\n\nToday, we’re living in a totally different world—and this is the moment conservative media has been waiting for.\n\nAn entire ecosystem of conservative outlets is challenging legacy media monopolies and shaping the narrative in Washington, D.C., and beyond.\n\nA few years ago, the White House Correspondents’ Association changed its membership rules to exclude outlets like The Daily Signal. Then Joe Biden’s White House revoked credentials for 442 reporters, including our correspondent.\n\nContrast that with the Trump White House. Karoline Leavitt upended the status quo when she added a “new media” seat that has featured a wide range of individuals who would have never found themselves in the White House briefing room under a different president.\n\nOn this very day, for example, my Daily Signal colleague Elizabeth Mitchell is serving as the White House new media pool reporter. Last week, she accompanied Vice President JD Vance on Air Force Two to Wisconsin and asked President Trump questions at his Cabinet meeting.\n\nWhite House Wire, an official government website and email newsletter from the Trump administration that curates news stories, featured in July alone articles from Breitbart, the Washington Times, Daily Wire, Daily Caller, Daily Signal, the Washington Examiner, and Blaze Media—all of which scored more links than the venerable New York Times, Associated Press, Bloomberg, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal.\n\nSeize This Moment\n\nThis democratization of news means Americans no longer depend on elites in Manhattan and Washington to set the agenda.\n\nToday, information flows rapidly on social media, unfiltered by traditional gatekeepers. Ordinary citizens equipped with smartphones capture and share newsworthy events, reaching their followers faster than traditional reporters.\n\nEach of you is part of the larger counterrevolution.\n\nAnd if we’re successful, this is an opportunity to build enduring media institutions that will rebuild trust in the role journalists play in a free society.\n\nWe won’t be gatekeepers. Instead, we will aim to give forgotten Americans a seat at the table in national debates about culture and policymaking.\n\nIt very much relates to the opportunity Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts spoke about at this National Conservatism Conference on Tuesday—it’s incumbent on us to build something better for future generations.\n\nAnd so, in conclusion, I want to suggest three practical steps:\n\nBecome citizen journalists yourselves. Use your social media platforms to share stories the legacy media won’t cover. Document what’s happening in your communities, your schools, your local government. You have the tools—now use them.\n\nSupport conservative media. Subscribe to our outlets. Share our content. Make small monthly donations. The Left has funded a media infrastructure for decades—we must do the same.\n\nTrain the next generation. Support programs that offer journalism internships or fellowships. Encourage young conservatives to pursue careers in media. We need a pipeline of talent to compete.\n\nAfter all, our counterrevolution needs warriors. We have the tools, the moment is right, and the stakes couldn’t be higher.\n\nThe question isn’t whether this transformation will continue—it’s whether we’ll seize this opportunity.\n\nAs one of my mentors, the late Ed Feulner would say—Onward!","summary":"Editor’s note: These are lightly edited remarks of a speech that Daily Signal President and Executive Editor Rob Bluey gave to the National Conservatism Conference...

The officers had originally been slated for crime-suppression work in the San Fernando Valley before their assignment changed, according to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n“Pulling police officers from protecting everyday Angelenos to protect a failed presidential candidate who also happens to be a multi-millionaire, with multiple homes and who can easily afford to pay for her own security, is nuts,” the board of directors of the Los Angeles Police Protective League — which represents over 8,700 LAPD officers — told the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe board added that Democrat Mayor Karen Bass “should tell Governor Newsom that if he wants to curry favor with Ms. Harris and her donor base, then he should open up his own wallet because LA taxpayers should not be footing the bill for this ridiculousness.” (RELATED: We Watched Kamala Harris On Colbert So You Don’t Have To. It Was A Trainwreck)\n\nFormer vice presidents traditionally receive Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office, but former President Joe Biden signed an executive order shortly before leaving office that extended Harris’s protection to July of 2026.

The news division said Friday that the Sunday show moderated by Margaret Brennan will present only interviews live or \"live to tape\" in which no edits are made. Exceptions will be made when classified national security information is inadvertently stated or language is used that violates Federal Communications Commission broadcast standards. \"In response to audience feedback over the past week, we have implemented a new policy for greater transparency in our interviews,\" a CBS News representative said in a statement. \"This extra measure means the television audience will see the full, unedited interview on CBS and we will continue our practice of posting full transcripts and the unedited video online.\" The representative declined to comment on the reason for the policy change beyond the statement. But the timing makes it clear that CBS News is reacting to Noem's complaints following her Sunday appearance in which she discussed the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Maryland man wrongly deported to his native El Salvador. He was returned to the U.S., where he faces deportation efforts. The complaints from Noem and the White House led George Cheeks, president and chief executive of CBS, and CBS News President Tom Cibrowski to come up with the new policy, according to a person familiar with the discussions who was not authorized to comment. Noem wrote on X that \"CBS shamefully edited the interview to whitewash the truth about this MS-13 gang member and the threat he poses to American public safety.” The Trump administration has accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of MS-13, which he has denied. A court has described the evidence of his connection as \"insufficient.\" Trump in April posed in the Oval Office with a digitally altered photo of Abrego Garcia's tattoos as purported evidence of affiliation with the gang. The policy change regarding live interviews will probably be seen as another capitulation to the Trump administration, which has shown a willingness to use legal measures to punish or attempt to silence critics in the media. It will also pose a challenge to \"Face the Nation\" producers who already operate in an environment where real-time fact-checking can't always keep up with the misinformation presented by guests on the program. \"It's a bad thing for the American public and a bad thing for journalism,\" said Mark Lukasiewicz, dean of the Lawrence Herbert School of Communication at Hofstra University. \"CBS News appears to be surrendering a significant editorial decision in the face of pressure of the administration. Editing an interview is a decision for the newsroom.\" The comments cut from the \"Face the Nation\" appearance were potentially defamatory. Noem said that Abrego Garcia was a member of MS-13 and that he solicited nude photos from minors. \"Even his fellow human traffickers told him to knock it off, he was so sick in what he was doing and how he was treating small children,\" Noem said in the unedited version of the interview she posted on X. The unsubstantiated claim that Abrego Garcia solicited nude photos from minors came from one of the alleged co-conspirators in a federal human smuggling case against him. Abrego Garcia denies the charge and has pleaded not guilty to the charges of illegally bringing people into the country, which stem from a 2022 traffic stop in Tennessee. \"Face the Nation,\" which has been on the air since 1954, became the focal point in a legal battle between CBS News and President Trump last year. Trump sued CBS News for $20 billion, claiming the program deceptively edited a \"60 Minutes\" interview with his 2024 opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. \"Face the Nation\" ran a clip from the interview that differed from what appeared in the \"60 Minutes\" broadcast, which led Trump to claim that her response to a question about Israel was edited to aid Harris and damage his election chances. \"60 Minutes\" aired a more concise and straightforward version of Harris' answer than did \"Face the Nation.\" Editing interviews for clarity and time restrictions of a broadcast is a common practice in TV news. While 1st Amendment experts said CBS News had done nothing wrong, parent company Paramount settled the case for $16 million to help clear the regulatory hurdles for its merger with David Ellison's Skydance Media. The merger was completed Aug. 7. \"Face the Nation\" is an hourlong program, with some CBS affiliates running only the first half-hour. One concern among media critics and journalists is that politicians will easily be able to run out the clock to avoid answers to tough questions if they know their responses won't be trimmed. Chuck Todd, the former moderator of NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" said setting the parameters for the length and editing of taped interviews was a constant subject of negotiation during his tenure. \"This comes up frequently with guests when you do it on tape instead of live,\" Todd said. \"None of this is a problem if they agree to come on live when your show is taping.\" Todd encouraged his guests to come on live, reasoning that \"it gives [subjects] as much control over the interview, as it does me.\" Sunday public affairs shows such as \"Face the Nation\" and \"Meet the Press\" have long been the most influential programs in network news divisions because they are closely watched by politicians and opinion leaders. But the no-editing policy also raises the risks that interview subjects will demand the same treatment on other programs. \"60 Minutes,\" which lands the biggest news makers and reaches a large audience, depends on taped interviews. CBS News is expecting additional changes as Skydance engages in talks to acquire the Free Press, the right-leaning web-based media company founded by former New York Times opinion writer Bari Weiss. The deal is said to be nearing completion, according to people familiar with the discussions, and would include a prominent role for Weiss at CBS News, even though she has no experience in running a TV news organization. Weiss and the New York-based Free Press are known for reporting and commentary that is staunchly pro-Israel and critical of progressive ideas that Trump and others deride as \"wokeness.\"","summary":"The policy change comes after Homeland Security chief Kristi Noem complained that her remarks on Aug. 31 program were shortened before airing.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-09-05/cbss-face-the-nation-will-no-longer-edit-interviews","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ff2a131/2147483647/strip/false/crop/7051x4702+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F15%2Fb3%2F66fec6804103aeaff7c6b78e874f%2Fgettyimages-192838979","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 17:33:52","author":"Stephen Battaglio","authors":["Stephen Battaglio"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.106},{"id":357762542,"title":"CBS News vows to air only uncut interviews on ‘Face the Nation’ after Kristi Noem uproar","text":"CBS News has overhauled its interview practices after a firestorm over claims from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem that her remarks were deceptively edited out of a “Face the Nation” appearance.\n\nThe network announced this week that its flagship Sunday show will now air only live or live-to-tape interviews, promising audiences they will see “the full, unedited interview” on television and online.\n\n“In response to audience feedback over the past week, we have implemented a new policy for greater transparency,” CBS said in a statement to The Post.\n\n“FACE THE NATION will now only broadcast live or live-to-tape interviews (subject to national security or legal restrictions).”\n\nCBS said its new transparency policy would prevent similar flare-ups.

Do not fall for his grand scheme. In other words, America’s descent into authoritarianism is a mere deflection.\n\nNo doubt, the president’s past friendship with the late financier and accused sex trafficker is a legitimate problem for the White House. Trump has repeatedly tried to dismiss the matter, calling it “a Democrat hoax that never ends” as recently as Wednesday. But it has proved to be a rare Trump controversy that has shaken his otherwise steadfast base. His supporters were adamant during the 2024 campaign that Trump should release the Epstein files, and candidate Trump assured that he would. In February, Attorney General Pam Bondi claimed that Epstein’s client list was “sitting on my desk right now to review.” In fact, there was no such list, the Justice Department later announced. A MAGA mutiny ensued.\n\nDemocrats saw an opportunity and began accusing the president of creating all manner of diversions to steal attention from his Epstein entanglements. They have not stopped since, no matter how extraneous the scandal might be to the topic at hand—everything from ICE raids down to Trump’s demand that the Washington Commanders change their name back to the Redskins and his threats to revoke Rosie O’Donnell’s citizenship. You name the recent escapade, and some adversary has tried to dub it a ploy to distract from Epstein.\n\nUpon learning that Trump had canceled former Vice President Kamala Harris’s Secret Service protection last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer retaliated by slapping Trump with a clever nickname, “Epstein Don” (take that, Mr. President!), and said that Trump was “ready to put everyone he can in danger to distract you from how he’s hiding the Epstein files.”\n\nAfter Trump said that “CROOKED” Senator Adam Schiff should “be brought to justice,” the California Democrat accused Trump of “political retribution” and “retaliation,” in addition to “trying to distract from his Epstein-files problem.”\n\nSenator Patty Murray, a Democrat of Washington State, recently called Trump “a pathetic wannabe dictator” for sending federal agents and the National Guard into the District of Columbia. Murray claimed that he was trying to turn D.C. “into his personal police state” with a mission to—get this—“distract you from his connection to the Epstein files.”\n\nThis is a curious strategy. Clearly, Trump’s opponents think they have a killer weapon with Epstein and believe that they should deploy it whenever possible; polls show that large majorities of Americans are not buying Trump’s assertion that the Epstein story is a “hoax.” But Trump’s strongman tactics are a far greater danger to America than his proclivity to “distract,” which is a fairly standard political-communications practice.\n\nThe distraction drumbeat not only dilutes the seriousness of Trump’s actions; it also exemplifies the Democrats’ own lame efforts to communicate a potent opposition message. It would seem beside the point for them to divert the public’s attention from the things this president does that are truly devious, un-American, and totalitarian. (See: Obama, Barack, fake AI-generated video of Oval Office arrest.) By constantly warning citizens not to lose focus on Epstein, Democrats imply that Trump’s day-to-day abuses in office are mere stunts and can thus be safely ignored.\n\n“It’s so stupid. It drives me insane,” Dan Pfeiffer, a Pod Save America co-host and former senior adviser to President Obama, told me. Democrats’ overeagerness to “shoehorn” everything Trump does into some alleged Epstein cover-up looks forced and inauthentic, Pfeiffer added. “If all you have to say is ‘Don’t pay attention to this; pay attention to this other thing that polls better,’ you’re not actually motivating people.” Other fervent anti-Trumpers have expressed similar frustration. “I want to congratulate leading Democrats for their insistence on saying the takeover of DC is a ‘stunt’ or a ‘distraction,’” Bill Kristol, the editor at large of the center-right publication The Bulwark, wrote on X. “It’s a rare trifecta of intellectual failure, political stupidity, and moral obtuseness.”\n\nAnd yet, Democrats continue to hurl the magic words in response to seemingly every brazen thing Trump does. Maryland Governor Wes Moore recently found himself in a social-media beef with Trump over the president’s threat to send the National Guard into “out of control” and “crime-ridden” Baltimore. Trump also suggested that he might “rethink” the federal government’s funding for the repair of Baltimore’s “demolished” Francis Scott Key Bridge, which was toppled by a cargo ship last year. After more back-and-forth, Moore trotted out his big torpedo. “Trump is doing everything in his power to distract from the Epstein files,” the governor wrote on X. “Really makes you wonder…”\n\nActually, what this makes me wonder is if Democrats’ continuous invocations of the Epstein-distraction theory might reveal their own lack of imagination—and underscore their inability to find a more effective line of attack against a president who seems to be providing them with endless material. In fact, Democrats’ eagerness to call everything a distraction from Epstein might even be distracting them from discussing much bigger and more far-reaching vulnerabilities for Trump (his failure to bring down prices, as he’d promised; the Republicans’ massive and wildly unpopular reconciliation bill passed in July).\n\nWith Congress back in Washington after its summer recess, the Epstein story flared anew Wednesday morning when a group of his accusers held an emotional press conference outside the Capitol. “There is no hoax,” one Epstein survivor said. “The abuse was real.” The same morning, Trump was hosting Polish President Karol Nawrocki for a White House visit that featured a rare flyover of F-16s. A White House spokesperson said that the display was meant to honor a Polish army pilot who had died in a crash last month. But the spectacle also produced a long, loud roar over a large area of downtown Washington, which interrupted the victims’ testimony for several seconds—an actual distraction, in contrast to some of the Democrats’ more tortured claims.\n\n*Sources: Joe Raedle / Getty; Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty; Bill Clark / CQ / Roll Call; Alex Wong / Getty; Ethan Miller / Getty","summary":"Democrats need a better line of attack against the president.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/democrats-trump-jeffrey-epstein/684115/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OU2BOivRodt5uYOXVN9t8r6oqrI=/0x0:4800x2700/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/09/2025_09_03_Trump_Epstein_Distraction/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 16:45:12","author":"Mark Leibovich","authors":["Mark Leibovich"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":357773024,"title":"New Docs Blow Open Biden Autopen Scandal, Put Spotlight On Kamala Harris","text":"Newly uncovered internal documents shed fresh light on former President Joe Biden’s use of the autopen and alleged outsourcing of decision-making during his final year in office.\n\nThe former president has insisted that he personally made all decisions regarding pardons, executive orders and proclamations, calling claims to the contrary “ridiculous and false.” However, internal memos and emails indicate that critical decisions — including clemencies — were quietly delegated to others, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, and it remains unclear whether Biden formally approved certain decisions, multiple outlets reported on Thursday.\n\nBiden aides initially insisted he personally sign by hand any official presidential actions. But by the end of his term, the standard had been abandoned, according to an internal memo obtained by Just the News.\n\n“Based on precedent from the Obama-Biden Administration regarding which documents generally are hand-signed by the President, our recommendation is that as a general rule, YOU personally approve and hand-sign all decisions that require Presidential action,” reads a February 2021 draft memo distributed to top White House officials. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Full Transcript: Daily Caller Interviews President Donald Trump)\n\nBy February 2024, authorization for clemency actions increasingly relied on Harris’ approval, according to a draft memo circulated by the White House Counsel’s office obtained by Just the News.\n\n“Given the President’s schedule, it can often take days or weeks for the President to review and approve the clemency package,” the lawyers’ memo reads. “The Chief of Staff’s office has been helpful in getting the paper in front of him for his review.”\n\n“He previously asked the White House Counsel to discuss the candidates with him, although in the last round the Vice President’s approval was sufficient to obtain his approval,” the lawyers noted.\n\nThe Trump White House concluded that this memo shows the former president was effectively “outsourcing” clemency decisions to Harris during his final year.\n\nDuring his four years in the White House, Biden granted 4,245 acts of clemency, more than any previous president on record, according to the Pew Research Center. All of Biden’s pardons from December to January — including those for family members, Dr. Anthony Fauci and Gen. Mark Milley — were reportedly signed by autopen, except for the preemptive pardon for his son Hunter.\n\nInternal emails cast further doubt on whether Biden approved the commutations of roughly 2,500 inmates jailed for crack cocaine offenses in January, the New York Post reported.\n\nOn Jan. 16, then-White House Staff Secretary Stef Feldman wrote to the West Wing lawyers requesting evidence that Biden had approved the commutations, according to emails obtained by the outlet. Then-Deputy White House Counsel Tyeesha Dixon forwarded the message to Michael Posada, chief of staff to the White House counsel’s office, for guidance.\n\n“Michael, thoughts on how to handle this?” Dixon asked, adding that the president “doesn’t review the warrants” in reference to the documents authorizing clemency.\n\nHowever, Posada’s response suggests that aides instead relied on then-Deputy Assistant to the President Rosa Po’s attestation of what the president “intended” to do, and it remains unclear whether Biden gave final authorization.\n\n“We will just need something from Rosa once the documents are ready confirming that the 21 people commuted to home confinement are who the president signed off on in the document titled X, and the # individuals listed in document titled Y are those with crack powder disparities who the president intended to commute,” Posada wrote.\n\n“Basically, something from Rosa making clear that the documents accurately reflect his decision. If you can give me a blurb whenever they are ready to suggest to Rosa, I can pass along,” Posada added.\n\nThe sentences of several individuals convicted of illegally possessing firearms, as well as two men whose actions resulted in the death of a police officer, were commuted as part of the sweeping action.\n\nThere were four meetings between December and January during which Biden was said to have given “verbal approval” for his wide-ranging clemency actions, according to Just the News. While retroactive emails indicate his presence, the National Archives had no staff notes confirming his attendance at the meetings or that he provided verbal approval.\n\nThe internal memos and emails were discovered as part of the Trump White House’s investigation into whether Biden aides “conspired to deceive the public about Biden’s mental state and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities and responsibilities of the President.”\n\nA former Biden White House staffer familiar with the pardon process denied that the president outsourced decision-making, according to the New York Post.\n\n“There is a concerted and willful blindness by Republicans when it comes to understanding how broad-based pardons work when they were issued by President Biden,” the source said, according to the outlet.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is installing a “Presidential Wall of Fame” in the Rose Garden and will be hanging a “Biden Autopen” portrait to mark the Biden presidency, he told the Daily Caller in an exclusive interview on Friday.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(RELATED: Trump Brings Peace To Yet Another Corner Of The World) \n\nMuch credit is due to Trump for brokering ceasefires.\n\nIran will not get a bomb in the next four years — as seemed likely when Biden left office.\n\nThe Middle East’s current most grotesque terrorist cadres and states — Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas, and the Houthis — are far weaker than they were when Trump entered office in January.\n\nThere is at least some engagement in envisioning the outlines of a ceasefire in Trump’s inherited Ukraine War.\n\nThe rub is finding the degree of ordnance necessary to convince Putin that increasing Russia’s casualties to more than one million will endanger his own dictatorship sooner than destroy Ukraine.\n\nBreaking up the new three-billion-person China/India/Russia nexus hinges on ending the war.\n\nThe economy is still strong. Gas prices are at historic lows. Increases in all types of energy production proceed full bore.\n\nCurrent GDP, inflation, unemployment, and the stock market — all at one time or another said to be in a crisis state — remain strong. Talk of an impending recession or hyperinflation is mostly muted.\n\nNo one quite knows either the full effects of Trump’s tariffs — especially given the injunctions issued by left-wing district justices — or of the promised over $10 trillion in foreign investments.\n\nMuch of Trump’s agenda will hinge on whether interest rates are lowered, Republicans survive the midterms, and the degree to which unelected left-wing lower-court justices can be stopped from hijacking the Constitution and de facto running the country.\n\nAs for the Democratic opposition, there is no counter agenda, no shadow government responsible leadership, and no willingness to craft bipartisan legislation.\n\nInstead, the left’s strategy is that of the kamikaze: to destroy Trump at the cost of destroying the Democratic Party.\n\nOtherwise, Democrats seek to prove so obnoxious in demonizing Trump that they create such mass hysteria that the weary electorate figuratively lies down, closes its eyes, covers its ears, and screams nonstop, “Make them all go away!”\n\nFormer foul-mouthed vice presidential candidate Tim Walz is now reduced to a ghoulish status. He recently boasted to an audience that rumors of Trump’s death — who survived two assassination attempts last summer — will thankfully one day prove true.

But Harris accepts that the more anyone hears her word salads, the more they will remember her 2024 train wreck.\n\nHead of the Democratic Party, Ken Martin, now screams that Trump is a fascist.\n\nBut by what standards does he judge? Did Trump try to take his rivals off state ballots?\n\nDoes he advocate for destroying the filibuster, the Electoral College, and the 156-year-old nine-justice Supreme Court, or packing the Senate by admitting two new states?\n\nAre local, state, and federal prosecutors — a la Bragg, James, Smith, and Willis — coordinating with the White House and DOJ to indict Trump’s current chief adversaries, such as Gavin Newsom, Kamala Harris, or Josh Shapiro?\n\nDid Trumpers hire a foreign spy to concoct a fake hit dossier on Democratic grandees?\n\nAre his subordinates now spreading it to the media?\n\nAre 51 conservative former CIA contractors and retired spooks swearing that Newsom or Harris is working with the Russians, Chinese, or any of our enemies?\n\nThe greatest Democrat fear?\n\nThat it has so institutionalized excessive executive orders, ad hominem lawfare, lower-court usurpation, state nullification of federal law, and federal intervention in higher education, the energy industry, and the nation’s open spaces that their own legacies empowered Trump and now will boomerang upon themselves — as the public applauds the karma.\n\nVictor Davis Hanson is a distinguished fellow of the Center for American Greatness.

The merger had been mired in regulatory limbo as the FCC, under chairman and Trump ally Brendan Carr, investigated claims that a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris amounted to news distortion.\n\nParamount settled Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit that claimed it illegally distorted the “60 Minutes” interview for $16 million.\n\nThe post CBS Changes ‘Face the Nation’ Editing Policy After Kristi Noem Interview appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/cbs-changes-face-nation-editing-160608149.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/VTcROyZPf7qP0JSk48qcRQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIwNDg7aD0xMTUyO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/thewrap.com/398550640c1a408de8727bb3857ff801","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-05 16:06:08","author":"Jd Knapp","authors":["Jd Knapp"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.094}]}
