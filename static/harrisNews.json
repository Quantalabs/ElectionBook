Senate seat – argues 79-year-old lawmaker is ‘too old’","text":"Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass) announced Wednesday that he will challenge Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass) for his Massachusetts Senate seat, arguing that the 79-year-old lawmaker, who has served in Congress since 1976, is “too old.”\n\n“Is he too old?” Moulton said in an interview with the Boston Globe. “Look, every political consultant will tell me not to say this, but the honest truth is, yes.” \n\n“Senator Markey is a very nice guy,” the congressman continued, “but he’s been in Congress for 50 years, and he’ll be 86 years old at the end of his next term as our junior senator.” \n\nMoulton, a 46-year old Iraq War veteran and six-term congressman, acknowledged that he and Markey see eye-to-eye on “the vast majority of issues,” but said, “it’s time for a new generation of leadership for Democrats and for America.”\n\nIn his campaign launch video, Moulton cited the lessons learned from the 2024 presidential election, which saw Kamala Harris get trounced by President Trump after she replaced Joe Biden on the Democratic ticket, amid mounting concerns about his age and mental acuity. \n\n“We’re in a crisis, and with everything we learned last election, I just don’t believe Sen. Markey should be running for another six-year-term at 80-years-old,” Moulton said in the clip. “Even more, I don’t think someone who has been in Congress for half-a-century is the right person to meet this moment and win the future.” \n\nMoulton called on Biden to drop out of the race last July in a Boston Globe op-ed, revealing that the then-president “didn’t seem to recognize me” in a small group setting at a D-Day anniversary event in Normandy earlier in the year. \n\nThe congressman also called out Democratic leadership, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). \n\n“Real people across Massachusetts are being hurt by Democratic leaders refusing to do everything they can to win,” he argued. “We’ve got to look in the mirror and be honest: it’s time for change.”\n\nMoulton told the Boston Globe that if elected he would “vote no on Senator Schumer for majority leader, because I believe our party needs new energy.”\n\nThe congressman said he’d champion “big, forward-looking, progressive solutions” if elected to the Senate. \n\nHe specifically cited “universal healthcare,” “high-speed rail,” “affordable housing,” “banning assault weapons” and “fighting climate change” as issues he’d take on. \n\nMarkey’s campaign did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"“Senator Markey is a very nice guy,” Moulton said, “but he’s been in Congress for 50 years, and he’ll be 86 years old at the end of his next term as our junior senator.” ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/15/us-news/democratic-rep-seth-moulton-launches-primary-challenge-for-ed-markeys-massachusetts-senate-seat-argues-longtime-lawmaker-is-too-old-to-serve-another-term/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/113535138.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Zbt1wxAP-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-15 23:55:36","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.169},{"id":369621446,"title":"MAUREEN CALLAHAN: Trump's depraved critics have committed their foulest act yet...","text":"How's this for a plot twist: An authoritarian, fascist dictator whose very existence is a threat to American democracy has not only brought peace to the Middle East but has saved the lone democracy in the region.\n\nNot that his enemies can even admit it.\n\nWe now have irrefutable evidence that Trump Derangement Syndrome is more intractable than long COVID. A historic week, a monumental achievement that saw the 20 remaining living hostages safely returned — thought never to happen just weeks ago — cannot be celebrated by the left.\n\nThey refuse. They simply cannot admit that President Trump achieved greatness here.\n\nIt's sick, truly.\n\nTake the staff at the otherwise dying, irrelevant Time magazine, deliberately choosing a terrible photo of Trump, taken from a universally unflattering angle, to memorialize his masterstroke.\n\n'Yes, it was on purpose,' a staffer told Daily Mail. 'We laughed about it.'\n\nAgain: legacy media wonders why it's dying. The Democrats wonder why they keep failing to win hearts and minds.\n\nWither Joaquin Phoenix, Javier Bardem and Mark Ruffalo – just a few of the 5,000 actors and filmmakers who signed an open letter pledging to boycott the Israeli movie industry?\n\nIt should be a matter of simple decency, of basic humanity, to cheer the release of hostages who spent 737 days being beaten, starved, raped and tortured in Gaza.\n\nEspecially on the left, whose woke progressives decried the 'genocide' taking place in Gaza. You would think they'd celebrate the American president who has finally brought peace to the region and ended said genocide.\n\nYou'd think that they'd speak up now as Hamas murder squads openly execute Palestinians – their own people – in the streets of Gaza, as the last remnants of the terror army grasp for control.\n\nNo, no and no.\n\nThe New York Times, in its physical Tuesday edition, had not one op-ed about the most consequential end to war in our lifetime.\n\nTheir headline, above the fold: 'Hostages and Prisoners Freed with Gaza's Path Unclear.'\n\nGaza's path unclear. Pay attention to this framing: It's not the end of war, the release of innocent hostages, and a moment the entire world exhaled. No: Gaza's path is unclear, so let's all perseverate on the only justifiable outcome when one side executes a terror attack, in scale and scope, that was Israel's 9/11.\n\nThe Times 'news analysis' inside the paper, by David E Sanger and Adam Ragson: 'The Lost Chances to Reach a Cease-Fire and a Hostage Deal.'\n\nIf that isn't the very definition of yesterday's news.\n\nAnother headline, same edition: 'Cheering Crowds Greet Freed Palestinians, Though Joy is Muted For Some.'\n\nMuted joy? Paging Kamala Harris!\n\nHarris, by the way, is out on her book tour and clearly testing the waters for a 2028 run. But she wouldn't even call Trump by his name in her statement about the peace deal.\n\nI'll spare you the unnecessary verbiage and get right to the relevant part of her statement on X: 'I commend the leaders and partners who made this agreement possible, including the president and his team.'\n\nImagine if Joe Biden had been the one to broker this. Of course that did not happen — in fact, it's extremely unlikely that Hamas would have ever gone through with the 10/7 attacks if Trump, rather than Biden, had been in office.\n\nAnd does anyone think for second that the feckless, weak, incomprehensible Kamala Harris, had she won 2024, would have gotten this done?\n\nYet here we have both former President Biden and his secretary of state, Antony Blinken, taking credit for this deal — which only goes to show how incredible they know it is.\n\nThey want what some of the Orange Hitler's got.\n\nChiming in from another galaxy, Biden wrote that 'the road to this deal was not easy. My administration worked relentlessly to bring hostages home, to get relief to Palestinian civilians, and end the war.'\n\nIf only he had done that when he had the chance.\n\nBlinken issued a similarly churlish, detached-from-reality statement on X, all but patting President Trump on the head for having 'adopted and built on the plan the Biden administration developed after months of discussion with Arab partners, Israel and the Palestinian authority.'\n\nIt's almost enough to make you forget that Biden was doddering around the White House, sleeping his days away, forgetting that dead colleagues were dead, and was so cognitively addled that his inner circle kept him from his own high-level military and war strategists.\n\nAnd where is Obama, the self-appointed arbiter of the moral universe?\n\nThe name Trump has yet to pass his lip — or his X feed.\n\nAs for the bulk of mainstream media — well, it doesn't surprise.\n\nNBC News took Andrea Mitchell out of the mothballs, where she thanked — on air! — Biden and Blinken for getting this done.\n\nShe went further in a reply to Blinken on X.\n\n'Thank you for spending two years working towards this moment,' she wrote.\n\nOver at CNN, a network in terminal decline, Christine Amanpour apologized — under duress from execs is my guess — for telling host Kaitlan Collins that the hostages, some of whom were forced to dig their own graves after being starved to skin and bones, 'were probably being treated better than the average Gazan, because they are the pawns and the chips that Hamas had.'\n\nThis is depraved. This is nothing less than institutional rot at the core of left-leaning media, which has learned nothing, nothing, from the rout of 2024.\n\nAt the very least, Amanpour should be suspended for that. At least two survivors of Oct 7 — survivors who escaped that day, not hostages — have committed suicide, unable to cope with their PTSD.\n\nRoei Shalev, who was shot that day and survived, killed himself on October 10th — just three days after the second anniversary of the attacks.\n\nHe was only 30 years old. He left a suicide note on social media.\n\n'Please don't be angry with me, please,' he wrote. 'No one will ever understand me, and that's OK because you can't understand. I just want this suffering to end. I'm alive, but inside everything is dead.'\n\nPresident Trump did what Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Antony Blinken could not. And it seemed he understood — far better than the ostensible party of caring and compassion — the very human costs of this war, and the costs to come.\n\nOnly one person here deserves credit. And as long as the Dems and their media enablers deny him, they can kiss any hope of 2028 goodbye.","summary":"How's this for a plot twist: An authoritarian, fascist dictator whose very existence is a threat to American democracy has brought peace to the Middle East.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-15195757/Trump-critics-gaza-peace-MAUREEN-CALLAHAN.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/15/20/103020027-0-image-m-14_1760554975361.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/13/7415006332347433772/1024x576_MP4_7415006332347433772.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-15 23:30:20","author":"Editor,Maureen Callahan","authors":["Editor","Maureen Callahan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":369625222,"title":"'The View' Co-Host Sunny Hostin Gets in Shouting Match With Cheryl Hines Over Her Husband RFK Jr.'s Qualifications on Live Show — 'May I Finish?'","text":"Tempers flared on The View when ultra-liberal Sunny Hostin began attacking guest Cheryl Hines over her husband, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F.

Her complaint points to a board-adopted rule that sets a minimum six-month timeline for contract bargaining, of which her original filing fell eight days short.\n\n“Teamsters union brass, increasingly unable to hold onto their rank and file, are choosing to silence worker voices by not allowing them the chance to have their wishes expressed via secret ballot elections,” said Foundation President Mark Mix. “This attempt to use any means to keep workers trapped in a union they oppose and never even voted for demonstrates why the NLRB should move to eliminate the various board-created hurdles that workers face when attempting to exercise their statutory right to hold decertification elections.”\n\nNLRB is the abbreviation for the National Labor Relations Board, which is responsible for overseeing local groups to ensure the enforcement of federal labor laws. Miller says the Pittsburgh regional director dismissed her first request, citing the timeline issue, which is not spelled out in statutes.\n\nIn July, a Coca-Cola driver in Houston, Pa., filed a federal lawsuit against Teamsters Local 585 violated his constitutional right to opt out of membership and avoid paying dues that can support political activities. However, the union contract stipulated that joining was mandatory.\n\nThe lawsuit points to what critics say is a slush fund for Democratic candidates bankrolled by automatic payroll deductions of union dues, many of whom rank-and-file members don’t support.\n\nThe Commonwealth Foundation, a conservative policy group based in Harrisburg, said government unions spent $33 million in 2023 and 2024 supporting political action committees and other causes, of which just 5.2% backed candidates from other parties.\n\nFoundation research shows that membership dues bankrolled more than half of the $227 million unions have spent on political endeavors since 2007. According to the report, the organizations spent the money on voting drives, lobbying, mailers, and PAC contributions to sidestep claims that the money doesn’t directly support political candidates.\n\nIn August, the Freedom Foundation filed an ethics complaint against the Pennsylvania State Education Association – which represents 177,000 current and retired educators – that says the union concealed a $1.5 million campaign contribution to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro by routing it through unauthorized political funds and the Democratic Governors Association, violating state and federal campaign finance law.\n\nIn a statement to The Center Square, the association spokesman Chris Lilienthal denied the allegations. Investigations remain ongoing.\n\n“PSEA, through its Fund for Student Success, made a lawful contribution to DGA, into an account that was permitted to accept union contributions,” he said. “None of those funds were used to make direct contributions to the Shapiro campaign.”\n\nAndrew Holman, a foundation policy analyst and author of the report, said that in a swing state like Pennsylvania, it’s “impossible” for 9 in 10 members to agree completely with their union bosses’ political priorities.\n\n“Government unions don’t even try to hide their blatant partisanship,” Holman said. “Unfortunately, it is union members who suffer when they learn how union bosses are spending their dues.”\n\nIn the 2024 election, for example, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined to endorse a presidential candidate – bucking a two-decade streak of Democratic support – because of its members’ differing views.\n\nA straw poll conducted that same year showed 60% of the union’s rank-and-file members supported Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. During the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Teamsters President Sean O’Brien reiterated the sea change.\n\n“The American people aren’t stupid,” he said. “They know the system is broken. We all know how Washington is run. Working people have no chance of winning this fight.”\n\nThe Teamsters represent 1.3 million workers – from newspaper reporters to zookeepers to police officers and everything in between – across the country. It was Republican congressional support guaranteeing sick leave for unionized rail workers, however, that inspired O’Brien to endorse Trump – even if he was called “traitor.”\n\n“I want to be clear: at the end of the day, the Teamsters are not interested if you have a D, R, or I next to your name,” he said. “We want to know one thing: what are you doing to help American workers?”\n\nHERE ARE THE GROUPS TRUMP HAS DESIGNATED AS TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS\n\nRegional chapters of the union stood behind Kamala Harris and other Democratic candidates. Holman’s research found that the same held true in Pennsylvania, where unions spent $2.1 million on state and local races that helped maintain the party’s one-seat majority in the state House of Representatives.\n\n“With a long-standing record of transparency issues within these unions, many members remain in the dark about what their dues are actually funding,” Holman said.","summary":"(The Center Square) – An emergency responder wants to disband Teamsters representation at her station in southwestern Pennsylvania.

Gina Hinojosa launches Democratic bid for governor","text":"One of the Texas Democrats who attempted to block Republican efforts to redraw the state's congressional maps mid-decade is looking to bring that fighting spirit to the governor’s mansion.\n\nAustin-area state Rep. Gina Hinojosa, a Democrat, on Tuesday launched a bid to unseat Republican Gov. Greg Abbott.\n\nHinojosa told ABC News she believes Texas voters desire a spirited, fresh candidate to take on Abbott, who is running for a fourth term.\n\n\"I think Americans are done with politics as usual and are interested in shaking off labels and just wanting to see something real,\" she said. \"I'm as real as you get -- a mom who got mad [who] ran for office.\"\n\nA former Austin ISD school board president, Hinojosa will center education, and campaigning on behalf of Texas public schools, in her bid. Hinojosa was elected to the statehouse in 2016.\n\n\"After 10 years, I now understand where our money is going and our money is going to vendor contracts and to enrich the billionaire class and not to the needs of Texans,\" she said.\n\nHinojosa was part of the first wave of legislators who, this summer, left the state to deny their Republican counterparts a quorum, which brought the Abbott-backed special session to implement new GOP-favored congressional maps to a screeching halt. \n\nThe quorum break kicked off a national redistricting saga; high-profile Democrats, like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Illinois. Gov. JB Pritzker, and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul hosted these lawmakers to protest the maps.\n\nPritzker took on an outsized role in the showdown, helping coordinate the travel and lodging of dozens of state lawmakers as they camped out in Illinois and ran out the clock. Former President Barack Obama even called into their Illinois’ encampment and offered support. \n\nTexas Republicans did eventually pass new congressional maps after establishing a second special session, though Texas Democrats, Hinojosa among them, heralded their collective action as a win. Newsom and California Democrats, in turn, launched their own effort to pass blue-leaning maps, bringing the issue to voters on a proposition this November.\n\nHinojosa said her involvement in the quorum break “opened my eyes” that voters are ready for a fight.\n\n\"I can run for governor because I have faith in Texans that they will have my back and that they are in this with me. That quorum break did expand my understanding of where Texans, where voters are today in 2025 when it comes to what they want to see their leaders doing,\" she said.\n\nBut Hinojosa, a self-described populist, has a lot of ground to gain. No Democrat has won a statewide office in Texas since 1994. And Texas’ Latino population has been slowly edging toward Trump over the last few elections. Trump led former President Joe Biden by 6 points in the state in 2020 -- and the gulf grew in 2024, when trounced former Vice President Kamala Harris by 14 points. \n\nShe must also edge out serious Democratic challengers in the primary. Andrew White, the son of former Texas Gov. Mark White, is also running. And she faces the potential of more well-known Democrats jumping into the fray. (Though Hinojosa says both Rep. Joaquin Castro and former congressman Beto O’Rourke have told her they’ve ruled out a gubernatorial run.)\n\nDespite it all, she feels she can navigate these challenges. And is making a bet that Texas voters feel the same.\n\n\"People want change. I'm the candidate of change. Greg Abbott is the candidate of status quo, of the insider club enriching themselves with our taxpayer dollars. So, I feel very good about being a candidate that represents the desires and what Texans want to see in a leader,\" Hinojosa said.","summary":"One of the Texas Democrats who attempted to block GOP efforts to redraw the state's congressional maps is looking to bring that fighting spirit to the governor’s mansion.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/texas-state-rep-gina-hinojosa-launches-democratic-bid/story?id=126546978","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/770934b6-840a-4705-a48e-15ac4eef57a6/gina-hinojosa-gty-jt-251015_1760549188272_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 19:35:35","author":"Brittany Shepherd","authors":["Brittany Shepherd"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.095},{"id":369603768,"title":"Jennifer Aniston's Gym Outfit Makes Fat Libs Faint, Sydney Sweeney's Trans Fix & Aikman HATES Caleb Williams","text":"Happy Hump Day! I woke up this morning and watched Topanga Lawrence on the TV, so it's apparently 1998 all over again. And buddy, I cannot think of a better way to start a Hump Day than by waking up to 1998 instead of 2025. The good news? Topanga is a smoke in both time periods! Who knew? What a heater. What a way to start my day. Let's keep the momentum rolling this afternoon. Welcome to a Hump Day Nightcaps – the one where Sydney Sweeney gives the Libs a lesson in being hot. Lord knows they need it. Bigly. What else? I've got another check-in on Kamala's ongoing book tour (it's going great!), Troy Aikman vs. Caleb Williams, and Jennifer Aniston kicking off the holiday season with a workout challenge for you SLACKERS out there. Myself included, of course. I'll gladly partake. Grab you a pumpkin lager to celebrate the halfway point of October (sad), and settle in for a Hump Day 'Cap! The Kamala book tour rolls on! Hate to start a Hump Day class with Kamala Harris – for obvious reasons – but I don't control the news. I've said for weeks now that this ongoing book tour is easily the best weekly #content on the internet. She's touting her insufferable book of lies, ‘107 Days,' and it's been a bloodbath everywhere she's gone. Just last week, the former VP phoned a friend to kick things off … and it was Hillary Clinton! Both morons proceeded to then talk about how they were a combined 4-0 against Donald Trump in debates. Seriously. Anyway, that's all peanuts compared to the #content we got out of Kamala's latest stop. When I say the left will, without a doubt, eat their own … this is what I mean: Did you know Mr. Feeny was still alive? Donald Trump has broken these people. Just broken them. Do you realize how far gone you have to be to accuse Kamala of being a righty? This is how nuts they are. LISTEN to this lunatic! She's just unhinged. Just yelling at Kamala the most batshit sentences ever strung together. \"You lost the election because you would rather be a Republican than a Democrat!\" \"We have four years of Trump because of your 107 days!\" \"You sold out the youth. You sold out the climate. Shame on you!\" The Dems may never win another election again. (Obviously they will, because they will cheat, but whatever). They don't have the young vote. They don't have the voters just behind the \"young vote.\" All they have are a certain section of boomers who are on their way out. That's it. Incredible. You know who did have the vote last night? Topanga Damn Lawrence! That's right. And Mr. Feeny! What a moment, especially for 90s kids like myself: Jennifer's Body, Sid schools the Libs & Troy vs. Caleb Incredible. I don't know who's more impressive 30 years later – Topanga still being a smoke at 44, or Mr. Feeny still being able to follow a script at 98. Both are true feats. We just spent four years under Joe Biden, and William Daniels is out here at 98 dancing his ass off with hot girls on network TV. OK, he didn't do much dancing, but he did enough. We can all agree Topanga's on the Mount Rushmore of 90s crushes, right? I know we just did this a few weeks ago, so I won't rehash it. But, I assume we're all on the same page. Also, take a look at this and tell me what you notice: How insufferable is Ben Savage? Cory Matthews has basically shunned the show that made him famous for DECADES now, and he doesn't even have the stones to show up to watch 98-year-old Mr. Feeny make what I assume will be his final ever TV appearance? Scumbag of the highest degree. He's a Lib, so this should shock no one, but still. It honestly ruins Boy Meets World for me. Well, that's not true. I still watch when it's randomly on at 1 a.m. on Cozi TV, but still. He's such a prick. Remember when he and his brother got into a fight in the final season because his brother played a handsy professor and was trying to bang Topanga? What a scene: You're just not getting that sort of TV nowadays. Not even close. Amazing. May have to start rewatching Boy Meets World now that I've seen Topanga again. Great show, even with the Lib playing the lead role. OK, let's rapid-fire this Hump Day class into a Hump Day night. First up? Speaking of 90s crushes, let's go ahead and check in with Rachel Green, who has a killer new workout for you fatties out there ahead of the holiday season. Again, myself included: What a CLASS! First Topanga fires an eight-inning shutdown with consistent 97 mph cheese, and now Jennifer Aniston closes the deal with 100 on the black. If Tiff Ann eats something naked again today, I might not make it. Next? No Tiff Ann, sadly, but … we do have Sid the Kid! Great work, Sydney! Look at that big, beautiful graph! Trans identification is in a freefall right now! This is what I voted for, boys and girls. So did you. Between this and the peace deal in the Middle East, I'm not sure Trump's had a better week in 2025. OK, two quickies on the way out. I know we haven't had a ton of sports today, but I'd like to quickly get a pulse check on the weird Troy Aikman vs. Caleb Williams battle going on right now. Bears fans in class today – what's the deal here? Did anyone notice Troy shitting on Caleb Williams the other night? Admittedly, I was far more locked into the Bills-Falcons game, so I didn't watch much of this one … but it's all over the internet right now. So much so that psycho Ben Johnson had to answer questions about it! Can someone send me clips of Troy shitting on Caleb? I've scoured the internet and can't really find anything. Regardless, I'm all in. LOVE a good announcer/player tussle. I'd imagine Troy isn't the biggest fan of Caleb's antics, from the finger painting to the one time he cried in the stands with his mom after losing at USC. Knowing Troy (and you know what I mean), I don't think that plays well with him. Just a hunch. OK, that's all for today. No hot girl to end class. You got Jen and Sid earlier. I have things to do and drinks to drink. So do you. Let's go have a big Hump Day night. OutKick Nightcaps is a daily column set to run Monday through Friday at 4 p.m. (roughly, we’re not robots). Was Troy out of line the other night?

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears are the only GOP gubernatorial candidates running in the off-season election, and both are increasingly adopting President Donald Trump's MAGA campaign tactics in the final throes of the 2025 cycle, Fox News Digital found. Election Day is three weeks away, on Nov. 4, with both gubernatorial candidates holding rallies across their respective states, joining debates against their Democratic opponents and championing platforms that align with Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" vision for the nation. Fox News Digital took a look at both candidates' recent public events as the race comes down to the wire, and found they have increasingly embraced the Trump agenda and the president's campaign tactics. FINAL FACEOFF: DEMOCRAT, REPUBLICAN NOMINEES IN KEY RACE FOR GOVERNOR BLAST EACH OTHER ON DEBATE STAGE Jack Ciattarelli Ciattarelli is making his third run for Garden State governor, buoyed by inroads Trump made with New Jersey voters during the 2024 federal election. New Jersey backed former Vice President Kamala Harris as president nearly one year ago, but post-election data shows Trump and the GOP gained ground — flipping five counties and cutting his 2020 loss from 16 points to six in 2024. The 2024 election reinvigorated Republicans in the state to flip it red come 2025. Trump endorsed Ciattarelli earlier in 2025, saying the self-described \"Jersey Guy\" has gone ALL IN\" on MAGA \"and is now 100% (PLUS!)\" TRUMP'S SHADOW LOOMS LARGE OVER HEATED RACES ONE MONTH BEFORE ELECTION DAY Ciattarelli, who criticized Trump during the 2016 election, has since aligned with Trump’s policies, including ending the state’s sanctuary protections for illegal immigrants, creating a voter ID system, and cutting spending and taxes in a state known for sky-high property costs. Ciattarelli is facing Democrat Rep. Mikie Sherrill at the polls, whom his campaign has compared to Trump election competitor Harris, characterizing Sherrill as a continuation of current New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy's administration. The Republican candidate held a Trump-styled rally in South Jersey's Wildwood beach town Oct. 10, returning to the town where Trump held a massive rally in 2024 and celebrated the state's growing support of conservatives. Dubbed the \"America First — Return to the Wildwoods Rally,\" the event drew attendance from MAGA influencers such as Jack Posobiec. Influencer and Trump ally Benny Johnson was slated to attend the rally before he received a letter threatening that he be \"exterminated.\" The Department of Justice has since charged an individual over the threats, and Johnson posted a video message expressing regret for missing the rally. Ciattarelli has taken a more confrontational tone in the campaign’s final stretch, including threatening a defamation lawsuit against Sherrill over claims he profited from the opioid crisis. Trump filed a defamation suit of his own during the 2024 cycle against ABC News anchor George Stephanopoulos for falsely claiming Trump was \"liable for rape\" in the E. Jean Carroll case. The defamation suit was dismissed after ABC agreed to a $15 million settlement. FIVE RACES TO WATCH WITH 5 WEEKS TO GO UNTIL ELECTION DAY 2025 Ciattarelli’s schedule mirrors Trump’s 2024 blitz, with seven scheduled events between Wednesday and Oct. 23 — including rallies, town halls and diner stops. Trump has \"been right about everything that he’s doing,\" Ciattarelli said while praising the president in remarks to the New York Post earlier in October. \"He’s secured the border, and the economy, inflation is much lower than it was when Joe Biden was in the White House,\" he said. \"But particularly because of what he’s done specific to New Jersey: putting a temporary hold on wind farms, beating up on New York Democrats for their congestion pricing plan, and quadrupling the SALT deduction.\" Winsome Earle-Sears The Republican lieutenant governor of Virginia is looking to ascend to the top leadership role of the state, as Gov. Glenn Youngkin is term-limited. The election pits the firebrand Republican against former Rep. Abigail Spanberger as Democrats look to flip the state blue. Unlike Ciattarelli, Trump has not yet endorsed Earle-Sears, but that hasn't stopped the GOP candidate from leaning into celebrating the president's policies and mannerisms. Earle-Sears joined a debate against Spanberger on Oct. 9, which was underscored by the Republican candidate repeatedly interrupting and staring down her opponent on stage — a political move that echos Trump's aggressive debate tactics in the 2016, 2020 and 2024 election cycles. Trump's mic during the 2024 debates against then-President Joe Biden — before Biden dropped out of the race — and Harris were muted to prevent interruptions and fighting on the debate stage. Earle-Sears repeatedly interrupted Spanberger during the debate and grilled her about condemning Jay Jones, a Democratic candidate for Virginia attorney general embroiled in a recently unearthed text scandal where he envisioned the murder of a top state Republican. TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT, BUT PRESIDENT FRONT AND CENTER IN 2025 ELECTIONS \"But really, what I want to ask this first question is: Abigail, when are you going to take Jay Jones and say to him, you must leave the race?\" Earle-Sears asked during the debate while looking at her opponent. Spanberger sidestepped answering whether she still endorsed Jones. Moderators repeatedly asked Earle-Sears to not speak over Spanberger in the debate, culminating in moderators cutting the candidates' mics in the final minutes of the debate. The Virginia candidate also has celebrated top MAGA policies, including ending sanctuary immigration policies in the state, an \"Axe of Tax\" plan that would end the state’s car tax and income taxes on tipped wages, and railing against socialism. Earle-Sears, originally from Jamaica, served in the Marine Corps. She jumped into politics in 2001, when she successfully ran to serve in the Virginia House of Delegates. She previously criticized Trump, including in 2022 when she suggested the Republican Party \"move on\" from him. EARLE-SEARS CHALLENGES SPANBERGER TO TELL KAINE, WARNER ‘DO YOUR JOB’ AND END SHUTDOWN Earle-Sears' campaign has said it would be \"honored\" to earn Trump's endorsement, celebrating his policies since his second inauguration. \"We would be honored to have President Trump’s endorsement,\" Earle-Sears' campaign told local Washington media in August. \"He is delivering real results for working Americans: lower taxes, a booming economy, secure borders, and a fearless defense of our freedoms. Winsome Earle-Sears shares that same fighting spirit. She’s a Marine, a conservative, and a proven leader ready to finish the job here in Virginia. With President Trump’s support, we’ll keep the Governor’s Mansion and stop the far-left cold.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to the White House for comment on a potential upcoming endorsement but did not immediately receive a reply.","summary":"New Jersey&apos;s Jack Ciattarelli and Virginia Lt.

Seth Moulton is challenging his fellow Massachusetts Democrat Sen. Ed Markey in next year’s Senate primary in a race that could shape up to be a bellwether over the direction of the Democratic Party. \n\n“Our party has clung to the status quo, insisted on using the same old playbook, and isn’t fighting hard enough. The next generation will keep paying the cost if we don’t change course,” Moulton said in his campaign announcement video. \n\nAt 46, Moulton is widely seen as a rising star in the Democratic Party, with broad appeal as both the holder of two master’s degrees from Harvard University and a former Marine Corps officer who served in the Iraq War. Moulton was awarded the Bronze Star for valor in combat, but avoided publicizing the honor—not even telling his parents—until the media began inquiring about his military record.\n\nMoulton has represented Massachusetts’ 6th Congressional District since 2015. \n\nMarkey, by contrast, is perhaps the definition of the longtime establishment of his party in Washington. He first served as a member of the House of Representatives from 1976 to 2013 before moving to the Senate. \n\nSen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., speaks at a press conference at the Capitol on May 5. (Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)\n\n“I don’t think someone who’s been in Congress for half a century is the right person to meet this moment and win the future,” the Massachusetts congressman contended in his campaign ad. \n\nMarkey turned back a primary challenge by then-Rep. Joe Kennedy III, D-Mass., in 2020, having portrayed himself as the more progressive candidate, with endorsements from Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass.\n\nBut that was five years and a presidential election ago, and at 79, it’s unclear whether Massachusetts voters will feel as comfortable handing the aging senator another six-year term in 2026. It’s not surprising, then, that Moulton is seeing an opening. He famously is not afraid to take aim at one of the Democratic Party’s most unpopular shibboleths with the general public: allowing males who “identify” as female to compete in women’s sports. \n\n“I have two little girls. I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat, I’m supposed to be afraid to say that,” Moulton said in comments to The New York Times after last November’s presidential election in which then-Vice President Kamala Harris lost both the popular and Electoral College votes.\n\nWhen Moulton faced blowback from the Left, the Massachusetts congressman doubled down, stating: “I stand firmly in my belief for the need for competitive women’s sports to put limits on the participation of those with the unfair physical advantages that come with being born male.” \n\n>>>See also: Democrats Still Don’t Get It on Transgenderism\n\nHowever, when it comes to his voting record on the issue, Moulton has toed the left-wing party line, voting for enshrining gender identity as a protected class in federal civil rights law.

Now a lawsuit alleges that Stride responded by mounting a coordinated attack on the district and its superintendent.\n\nIn 2020, Gallup-McKinley County Schools contracted with Stride (formerly known as K12 Inc) to operate its New Mexico Destinations Career Academy. But the district alleges that the for-profit organization repeatedly cut corners, violated staffing rules, and inflated enrollment numbers. In May 2025, the school board voted to end the contract.\n\n\"Our students deserve better,\" said School Board President Christopher Mortensen in a press release. \"This action is not sudden; it is the result of months of effort to address persistent issues with the contractor. We are taking this step to protect our students, uphold academic standards, and meet our obligations under state and federal law.\"\n\nWithin months, the district had filed a complaint against Stride, charging them with fraud, unfair trade practices, civil conspiracy, and seven other counts. That lawsuit outlines the issues between Stride and the district.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Stride had continuing issues with meeting requirements for student-teacher ratios, having been notified as early as September 2023 that it was out of compliance. Special education teachers were over their permitted caseloads, and IEP students were not receiving their due process. Further, Stride failed to employ certified teachers, complete background checks, or provide state-mandated occupational and professional trainings to their staff.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nThe district also alleges that Stride “retained nonexistent students on its rolls” and took school district funds for educating these ghost students. Stride failed to provide timely required communication with the district. Stride’s graduation rate, says the district, was “horrific,” with a graduation rate of 27.67% in 2024.\n\nThe district also claims that through it all, Stride has “ignored compliance requirements” and failed to produce a remediation plan.\n\nAccording to the suit filed by the district, a management representative of Stride came forward in May as a whistleblower, declaring that the increases in student-teacher ratios was “intentional… in order to increase profit margins.\" The whistleblower reported that he made multiple attempts to inform upper management that Stride was out of compliance with state law, and asked for authority to hire the roughly 80 teachers needed. The Vice President of Finance, says the whistleblower, refused to authorize those hires. Instead, in a later meeting, the whistleblower was allegedly told that his “projected profit margin was too low.” He was directed to cut staff for the next year to meet projected profit margin.\"\n\nAccording to the whistleblower, Stride’s plans to deal with their troubles were not focused on meeting their obligations to the district.\n\nInstead, the whistleblower says, at an April meeting Stride’s Senior Vice President of School Development “Peter Stewart said the company should attack first publicly and Stride Inc. should develop a strategy for that” and that Stride CEO “James Rhyu said [to the group] that the Superintendent [for the School District] was in over his skis on this issue.”\n\nAlleges the district’s suit, ”Stride’s management, including the individual Defendants, engaged in and agreed to a civil conspiracy to cover up its misconduct and illegal activities acting, by and through its employees, agents and attorneys, in planning and engaging in a systemic public attack on the School District and its Superintendent of Schools to distract from its illegal activities and its breach of the contract with the Board of Education.\"\n\nAnd counter-attack they did. On April 22, the district sent Stride a letter charging it had “materially breached” its contract. On April 28, the company filed an ethics complaint against GMCS Superintendent Michael Hyatt, alleging that he had tried to leverage Stride’s contract with the district in order to secure a “lucrative position” with Stride. Hyatt had applied for a management position with Stride in 2024; the company declined to hire him.\n\nThe list of complaints by the district against Stride is long, but the theme is simple enough.\n\nDefendant Stride purposely and willfully disregarded the contractual requirements and the statutory and regulatory requirements in order to defraud the School District to increase its profits…\n\nDefendant Stride, while obligated to provide a certain quality of education to students, disregarded its legal obligations with the sole intent to profit on the education of students that it was supposed to educate, and that profit was obtained illegally through the intentional 27 violations of State law, incomplete and false reporting of student data, withholding technical support and operating and manipulating student counts to include students who had been dropped, withdrawn or were excessively absent.\n\nAsked for comment on the suit, a Stride representative directed me to the company’s suit-related web site which argues that the company has been working on an improvement plan, that their student-to-staff ratios are better than those reported by the district, and that “explosive growth” of NMDCA makes it hard to stay caught up with staffing. A reply to the district’s Aprill 22 letter contests virtually every point that the district has made about Stride’s performance.\n\nSince being cut loose from GMCS, Stride has re-opened NMDCA as a cyber charter school partnered with Charna Valley Independent Schools and Santa Rosa Consolidated Schools; a fact sheet from Stride says 3,000 students are enrolled, including 2,300 returning families. Those families, they say, are largely satisfied with the school. They also point out that many students enter the school short of credits, and that the majority of students are closing that gap. The Stride representative also sent a fact sheet alleging that GMCS is facing other legal problems.\n\nBut Stride is no stranger to legal issues. It was founded in 2000 as K12 Inc by Ron Packard, former banker and Mckinsey consultant, and quickly became the leading national company for cyber schooling. One of its first big investors was Michal Milken. That investment came a decade after he pled guilty to six felonies in the “biggest fraud case in the securities industry” ending his reign as the “junk bond king.” Besides Milliken, Stride investors have included brothers Lowell and Larry Elison, and BlackRock, founded by Larry Fink, whose brother Steve sits on the Stride Board of Directors.\n\nIn 2011, the New York Times detailed how K12’s schools were failing miserably, but still making investors and officers a ton of money. Former teachers wrote tell-alls about their experiences. In 2012. Florida caught K12 using fake teachers. The NCAA put K12 schools on the list of cyber schools that were disqualified from sports eligibility. In 2014, Packard turned out to be one of the highest paid public workers in the country, \"despite the fact that only 28% of K12 schools met state standards in 2011-2012.\"\n\nIn 2013 K12 settled a class action lawsuit in Virginia for $6.75 million after stockholders accused the company of misleading them about “the company’s business practices and academic performance.” In 2014, Middlebury College faculty voted to end a partnership with K12 saying the company’s business practices “are at odds with the integrity, reputation and educational mission of the college.”\n\nIn 2016 K12 got in yet another round of trouble in California for lying about student enrollment, resulting in a $165 million settlement with then Attorney General Kamala Harris. K12 was repeatedly dropped in some states and cities for poor performance.\n\nIn 2020, they landed a big contract in Miami-Dade county (after a big lucrative contribution to an organization run by the superintendent); subsequently Wired magazine wrote a story about their \"epic series of tech errors.\" K12 successfully defended itself from a lawsuit in Virginia based on charges they had greatly overstated their technological capabilities by arguing that such claims were simply advertising “puffery.”\n\nThe district is seeking compensatory and punitive damages from Stride. Four Stride executives are named in the suit in addition to Stride Inc itself. The court will decide who’s blowing smoke here. In the meantime, school districts continue to learn about the price of teaming up with aggressively for-profit partners.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Stride, a giant in the cyber charter school industry, was accused by a New Mexico school district of violating rules and regulations.

Many of its 8,500 residents once lost internet service after squirrels chewed through a fiber-optic cable. Ranchers fear wolf attacks on cattle.\n\nRELATED: Will your congressional district change if Prop. 50 passes? Use these maps to find out\n\nTech-industry wealth, meanwhile, has transformed Marin from a bohemian refuge outside San Francisco into one of California’s richest communities. Traffic regularly jams the freeway into the city, and residents fight over efforts to build more homes.\n\nThe two counties represent utterly different Californias. But if Governor Gavin Newsom has his way, they’ll soon share a member of Congress.\n\nNewsom and his fellow Democrats want to redraw California’s congressional district maps – and change the balance of power in Washington, DC. They’ve asked voters to approve a ballot measure in November that would temporarily take control of the maps away from an independent commission and give it to the state legislature, dominated by Democrats. Proposed maps already released would combine sparsely populated Republican communities like Modoc with deep-blue cities and suburbs, such as Marin. Democrats could win as many as five additional seats.\n\nIt’s a direct response to redistricting in Texas, where President Donald Trump pushed officials to redraw the state’s maps in favor of Republicans. That playbook is being rapidly embraced by other states both red and blue. North Carolina GOP legislators on Monday announced plans to vote on new congressional maps, and Maryland, Missouri and Florida have discussed similar moves. Newsom casts the California measure – Proposition 50 – as nothing less than a fight to save American democracy, by giving his party a chance to retake Congress in next year’s midterm elections and stand up to Trump.\n\nRELATED: Do California redistricting ballot envelopes reveal your vote? Debunking social media rumors\n\nModoc voters, however, see it as a way to silence them. In far-northern California, the ballot measure has added to long-simmering resentment of distant Sacramento and the state’s wealthier cities. Some residents have even revived talk of seceding from California and forming their own state, dubbed Jefferson — an idea that dates back decades.\n\n“Prop 50 disenfranchises the rural voices of northeastern California,” said Ned Coe, chair of the Modoc County Board of Supervisors. “Allowing elected officials in Sacramento to draw maps to their advantage for a short-term gain is not good governance, regardless of what color shirt you wear.”\n\nMany Marin residents would agree, at least in theory. A strong majority of California voters created the state’s current system for drawing maps, passing a pair of ballot measures in 2008 and 2010 that handed the job to an independent, bipartisan commission. They’re loath to ditch that system, even temporarily, since Prop 50 would give redistricting power back to the commission after the 2030 census. But alarmed by Trump, some see little choice.\n\n“What I really support is a fair, nonpartisan system of determining districts,” said Teresa McGlashan, 62, from Mill Valley. “But I agree with Governor Newsom that we need to have a response to what Texas is doing.”\n\nSo big are the stakes that Democrats and Republicans nationwide are pouring money into the fight. The Prop 50 campaign has raked in more than $134 million, according to the Secretary of State’s office, while the opposition has raised $78 million. Billionaire investor and former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer last week pledged $12 million to support the measure.\n\nWhile many donors focus on the debate’s national implications, Coe and other Modoc residents worry about effects closer to home.\n\nCoe, a rancher, lives a few miles from the 111-year-old county courthouse in Alturas, where every seat in the court chamber has a rack for cowboy hats. Buying milk can turn into an hour-long activity for the easily recognizable Coe, with his white handlebar mustache, as constituents stop him in the grocery aisles to talk about local issues. If the maps proposed by California Democrats are approved, Modoc could soon be represented by Congressman Jared Huffman, who lives in the Marin County city of San Rafael — a six-hour drive in good traffic.\n\nRELATED: Election 2025: Everything Bay Area voters need to know before Nov. 4 election\n\nCoe, 68, notes the two counties have some things in common. Both struggle to keep roads paved and provide health care in rural areas. Residents in each root for the San Francisco 49ers. When dealing with government officials, however, distance can make a difference.\n\n“The farther away you get from home as an elected official, the less that you see the impact of your actions,” Coe said.\n\nThe Modoc County Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution in September opposing Prop 50 for its “detrimental impact on rural representation and community integrity.”\n\nThe county is currently represented by Republican Congressman Doug LaMalfa, who risks losing his seat if the redistricting plan is approved. “No state should be doing mid-decade redistricting,” he said, during a tour of the rice fields that have been in his family since 1931. A Trump ally, LaMalfa is a proud Christian who doesn’t shy away from evangelizing and whose wife home-schooled their kids. He says he’s one of only a handful of congresspeople who can operate an 18-wheeler.\n\nLaMalfa worries about the future of American farming and blames onerous regulations and trade policies for some of its woes. He’s critical of California’s environmental policies for driving up costs, as well as the state’s response to the devastating 2020 North Complex Fire that came close to his family’s ranch.\n\n“How much of that crap can we take from Sacramento?” LaMalfa asked.\n\nHe says Prop 50 could become the catalyst for a long-sought local dream — a new state of Jefferson, forged from counties in northern California and southern Oregon. Backers say the idea is fueled by political, economic, and cultural alienation that the ballot measure will only amplify. Indeed, the roads near LaMalfa’s ranch already sport both “No on 50” and “State of Jefferson” lawn signs.\n\n“We barely have a voice as it is, and Prop 50 would completely take that away from us,” said Carol Madison, executive director at a private social services non-profit in Modoc called TEACH Inc. “I think the State of Jefferson is a great idea.”\n\nThe daunting logistics of creating a new state make it unlikely, said Dan Schnur, former chairman of the California Fair Political Practices Commission. An oft-discussed alternative — seceding from California and joining a conservative “Greater Idaho” — seems equally doubtful. But politicians ignore the frustration behind those ideas at their peril, he said.\n\n“It’s indicative of how voters in that region are feeling alienated from the state government,” Schnur said.\n\nMake America Great Again banners give way to LGBTQ flags and anti-Elon Musk bumper stickers in Marin County, where opposition to Prop 50 is much harder to find. The county Board of Supervisors passed a resolution supporting the measure. “A couple of seats in Congress really change the dynamics, particularly when it comes to healthcare,” said Supervisor Mary Sackett.\n\nMill Valley Councilmember Urban Carmel said that while many residents initially opposed Prop 50, considering it out-of-step with local values, they now see it as necessary to counter Trump’s consolidation of power. “Desperate times call for desperate measures,” he said.\n\nBut in a warning to Newsom, not all Marin residents are convinced. Even though Kamala Harris carried 80% of the vote during the 2024 presidential election in this proudly blue community — a land of electric cars and curbside composting — many don’t want to tamper with California’s nonpartisan redistricting system.\n\n“I think Prop 50 is short-sighted, because having an independent commission is probably a better approach in the long-term,” said Libby Wood, 69, owner of Senior Settlers, a downsizing and relocation management company in San Rafael. “I fear that the move away from independent redistricting might be permanent.”\n\nResearch firm co/efficient polled nearly 1,000 likely voters between Sept. 29 and Oct. 1 and found 54% said they support the measure, while 36% opposed it and 10% said they were undecided.\n\n“Redistricting might be a pox on all our houses, but then again, we don’t have a choice,” said Jason Overman, co-founder of Progress Public Affairs, a Bay Area political consultancy firm. “Prop 50 could be the difference between having an election in 2028 or not.”\n\n–With assistance from Eliyahu Kamisher, Denise Lu, Elena Mejía and Anna Edgerton.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com\n\n©2025 Bloomberg L.P.","summary":"Golden State Democrats say they need more seats in Congress to counter Trump.

She even phoned a friend just last weekend in Hillary Clinton, and it was as unbearable as it sounds. With alllllll that being said, I've never, in my life, heard Kamala referred to as … a \"right-wing war criminal\" … like she was last night by some absolute LUNATIC from something called \"Climate Defiance.\" Rollllllllll tape! The Dems always eat their own Amazing. Look at the former vice president GO up there! She is PISSED. You can call Kamala Harris a lot of things, but don't you DARE call her a righty. That's where she draws the line, as you can see. What do I ALWAYS say about the Libs? They will, without a doubt, end up eating their own. Every single time. They're all so far left at this point, that Kamala Harris is now apparently considered a Republican. Do you understand how insane that is? That party may never win another election again. (Obviously they will, because they will cheat, but whatever) They don't have the young vote. They don't have the voters just behind the \"young vote.\" All they have are a certain section of boomers who are on their way out. That's it. Donald Trump has just broken these people. LISTEN to this lunatic! She's just unhinged. Just yelling at Kamala the most batshit sentences ever strung together. \"You lost the election because you would rather be a Republican than a Democrat!\" \"We have four years of Trump because of your 107 days!\" \"You sold out the youth. You sold out the climate. Shame on you!\" Amazing.

I am not. We see these videos with... lots of different people.'\n\n'Human beings have bad days,' Goldberg added.\n\nIt's yet to be seen whether Porter suffers with voters. The primary isn't until June, and the general election is in November 2026. But the unflattering videos are certain to encourage other potential candidates to give the wide-open, crowded race a look.\n\nDemocratic US Sen. Alex Padilla is among those who have not ruled out a run in the 2026 contest.\n\n'There are quite a few people looking at this field and saying, \"There has got to be somebody better,\"' said Democratic consultant Andrew Acosta. 'Potential candidates are watching, \"How far does Porter fall?\"\n\n'I think this whole thing is indicative of a race that is not catching fire,' he added.\n\nPorter - who became a social media celebrity by brandishing a white board at congressional hearings to dissect CEOs and break down complex figures into assaults on corporate greed - is probably the best-known candidate in a race that was bypassed by former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nPorter is known for her potent small-dollar fundraising across the country.\n\nThe crowded field to replace outgoing Gov. Newsom includes former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former Biden administration health secretary Xavier Becerra and former state controller Betty Yee, all Democrats, and Republicans Steve Hilton, a conservative commentator, and Chad Bianco, the Riverside County Sheriff, among others.","summary":"The Democrat was ahead in the race to succeed Gavin Newsom before she went viral for her rude treatment of a journalist and her own staff members.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15194345/California-Governor-Katie-Porter-admits-bully-impatience.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/15/13/103006771-0-image-m-11_1760530330529.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/08/3510054249005496384/1024x576_MP4_3510054249005496384.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-15 13:30:29","author":"Editor,Germania Rodriguez Poleo","authors":["Editor","Germania Rodriguez Poleo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":369534862,"title":"Sherrill’s Campaign Receives Thousands from CCP-Connected Businessman","text":"A Chinese-born auto executive whose company has documented connections to the Chinese Communist Party has contributed at least $65,000 to Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s gubernatorial campaign in New Jersey, according to federal records, as the congresswoman faces growing scrutiny from her Republican opponent Jack Ciattarelli amid a tightening race.\n\nFederal Election Commission filings show that Pin Ni, president of Wanxiang America Corporation, donated $60,000 to One Giant Leap, a super PAC supporting Rep. Mikie Sherrill’s (D-NJ) bid for governor, and another $5,800 directly to her campaign in June — the maximum allowed under federal law.\n\nNi’s eligibility to donate remains uncertain. Records indicate he holds a U.S. Social Security number, though it is unclear whether he is a permanent resident or U.S. citizen, both of which are required for campaign donations.\n\nWanxiang America is the U.S. division of Wanxiang Group, China’s largest auto parts manufacturer. The conglomerate’s late founder, Lu Guanqiu, was described in Chinese state releases as an “outstanding Communist Party member.” Lu’s son, Lu Weiding, and son-in-law, Pin Ni, currently oversee company operations. U.S. Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) previously raised concerns about Wanxiang Group’s close ties to the CCP in a 2023 letter referencing its history of cooperation with Chinese government institutions and Party representation in official state bodies.\n\nNi has also contributed to other political campaigns, including $14,500 to Sherrill’s congressional efforts across recent cycles and donations to both Democratic and Republican committees nationwide. Federal records list a $6,000 contribution from Ni to the Republican National Committee in August.\n\nIn May 2024, Ni told Bloomberg that many U.S. business partners were reluctant to work with companies that have Chinese backgrounds, saying they feared “sooner or later they’re going to have a government issue.”\n\nThe news comes as the New Jersey governor’s race intensifies, following a series of controversies surrounding Rep. Sherrill’s remarks and record. During the final debate earlier this month, Sherrill accused Ciattarelli of “killing tens of thousands of people” through his former publishing company’s role in the opioid crisis. Ciattarelli’s campaign has since announced plans to sue for defamation, calling the accusation “a clearly defamatory attack.”\n\nSherrill’s campaign has also faced questions regarding her Naval Academy record after reports surfaced that she was barred from walking at her 1994 graduation due to her involvement in a cheating scandal. Additional scrutiny arose over the Naval Academy admissions of two of her children and her past comments criticizing U.S. military deployments.\n\nThe contest between Sherrill and Ciattarelli remains highly competitive, with polls showing the race within the margin of error. Former President Donald Trump has endorsed Ciattarelli, and recent surveys from Emerson College and The Hill show both candidates polling near 43 percent.\n\nThe revelations about the CCP-linked contributions follow broader national concerns over Chinese influence in American politics. Earlier Breitbart investigations have detailed cases involving Chinese government-affiliated figures contributing to Democratic candidates, including Vice President Kamala Harris and Boston Mayor Michelle Wu, as well as House Oversight Committee findings on CCP-linked outreach operations targeting state officials.","summary":"A Chinese-born auto executive whose company has documented connections to the Chinese Communist Party has contributed at least $65,000 to Rep.

Thank you darling.\"\n\nDozens have since slammed his response as 'patronising' and 'misogynistic'.\n\n\"This is not just dismissive,\" penned one on Twitter. \"It’s a strategic act of rhetorical control that reframes inquiry as entertainment, undermines professional legitimacy, and reinforces a gendered power dynamic in public discourse. It mirrors the entertainment industry.\"\n\nAnother added: \"No idea why every member of that press corp doesn't all just leave en masse when he comes out with patronising, misogynistic s*** like this.\"\n\nA third said it was plain 'sexual harassment on full display' and 'gross' while many more said it was 'creepy'.\n\nIt's also not the first time Trump has commented on a journalist's appearance.\n\nIn 2017, he paused a diplomatic call with the then Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to beckon RTE presenter Caitriona Perry over to his desk.\n\nHe then said to the Irish politician in the call: \"She has a nice smile on her face, so I bet she treats you well.\"\n\nIn this past week alone, Trump has also made yet another tongue-in-cheek comment about his own White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt.\n\nAfter signing off on a peace deal between Israel and Hamas earlier this week, the president randomly started talking about the 28-year-old's appearance, stating: \"That face... and those lips. They move like a machine gun, right?\"\n\nHe made the same comment about Leavitt's mouth back in August.\n\nOther members in the Trump administration that have been on the receiving end of his cringe-inducing attempts at flattery include Attorney General Pam Bondi and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, both of whom, on separate occasions, he said he was unable to call 'beautiful' as it would be 'the end of my political career.'\n\nMeanwhile, those beyond his circle seem to be the subject of sexist insults.\n\nFor instance, he said New York Times columnist Gail Collins had 'the face of a dog' when she wrote about his bankruptcy, declared Fox presenter Megyn Kelly a 'bimbo' and alluded to her menstruating when she grilled him on previous accusations of sexism in a US presidential campaign debate.\n\nAnd he said Arianna Huffington, editor of Huffington Post, was 'unattractive both inside and out' and jibed at her divorce.\n\nOn Twitter, he also claimed Clinton couldn't 'satisfy' her husband in a thinly veiled dig at Bill Clinton's affair, and later remarked how 'blowjobs impacted' Clinton and Harris' careers, accusing the politicians of rising through the ranks due to sexual favours.\n\nHe also called 1996 Miss Universe winner and Venezuelan actress Alicia Machado 'Miss Piggy' and 'Miss Housekeeping'.\n\nHe's also implied actress Anne Hathaway is a gold digger; singer Cher has had 'massive plastic surgeries that didn't work' and declared Angelia Jolie 'not' beautiful...","summary":"![CDATA[The POTUS has a lengthy track record of making similar comments]]","url":"https://www.unilad.com/news/politics/donald-trump-misogynistic-comment-to-female-reporter-431374-20251015","image":"https://images.ladbible.com/resize?type=webp&quality=70&width=1200&fit=contain&gravity=auto&url=https://images.ladbiblegroup.com/v3/assets/blt949ea8e16e463049/blt867c0e58b6bc8cbc/68ef97a1c85d0fa3844d2262/Screenshot_2025-10-15_at_11.42.41.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 13:20:15","author":"Liv Bridge","authors":["Liv Bridge"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":369475126,"title":"Katie Porter Can&#039;t Deny More Videos Could Come to Light","text":"Katie Porter has not denied that more videos of her rebuking staff members could come to light ahead of her gubernatorial run.\n\nSpeaking during an appearance on Nexstar’s Inside California Politics, the potential Democratic candidate for California governor reacted after an old video of her telling a staffer to “get out of my f****** shot” emerged last week.\n\nNewsweek has reached out the Porter campaign via email for comment.\n\nWhy It Matters\n\nCalifornia will elect its next governor in 2026 when Gavin Newsom, who has served in the role since 2019, will see his term end. Porter is running for the governorship after an unsuccessful Senate bid last year.\n\nThe state is reliably Democratic. It backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 20 points last November and hasn’t elected a Republican governor since Arnold Schwarzenegger served between 2003 and 2011. Anything Porter does that could dampen Democratic support in the state will worry the party.\n\nKatie Porter speaks to supporters at an election night party, March 5, 2024, in Long Beach, California.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nA video, obtained by Politico, which said it was dated July 2021, showed Porter talking to then-Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm in a video call about electric vehicles when a member of her staff moves into the background.\n\n“Get out of my f****** shot,” Porter told the unidentified female employee.\n\nCalifornia gubernatorial candidate Katie Porter (D) REFUSES to say that there are not more videos of her berating and humiliating staffers that are going to come out pic.twitter.com/1eRIllo4EL— Ryan Saavedra (@RealSaavedra) October 15, 2025\n\nWhen asked by host Nikki Laurenzo: “Can voters be confident that there won’t be another one of those videos that come to light,” referring to the incident with her staffer, Porter did not directly answer the question and said: “What I do know is that I could have done better in that situation.”\n\n“That’s not a no, so is there potentially another video that we are going to see?” Laurenzo asked.\n\nPorter said the video was several years old and that she had apologized to the staffer in the video. She said she promised “to do better.”\n\nAsked again if there could be more videos, Porter refused to rule the possibility out and said: “I am taking responsibility for this situation and I’m also not going to back down from fighting back for California.”\n\nFootage of Porter threatening to leave a CBS News interview held weeks ago also recently surfaced online. She clashed with host Julie Watts about whether Porter would need to win over President Donald Trump supporters to win the gubernatorial election.\n\nShe was hit with criticism about the interview and a fake AI-generated video of Porter slapping Watts went viral.\n\nMeanwhile, new polling has suggested that while Porter is leading among other Democrats ahead of the upcoming primary for the election, she is behind a Republican candidate, conservative commentator Steve Hilton, by 6 percentage points.\n\nHowever, previous polls have painted a more favorable picture for Porter. An Emerson College poll from August showed Porter leading the primary for California governor with 18 percent, followed by Hilton at 12 percent, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco at 7 percent, and former Democratic Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa at 5 percent.\n\nScott Lucas, who teaches international politics at University College Dublin, said people would forget the video by the time of the election. He said Porter was still leading in most polls.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nSpeaking to Newsweek, Scott Lucas said: “It’s a story for the moment, but the reality here is that Katie Porter in a widespread field is still leading.” He added that there was a “long road to go” until the election and people may not remember the videos by then. “This is not an eve of election video,” he said. “I don’t see this as being a game-changer.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nCalifornia’s primary is scheduled for June 2026.

She would later go on to anchor ABC News and host programs on PBS while primarily doing war reporting for CNN. \n\nTHE CLOSING OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MIND\n\nSo while the British-born star is decorated, she is anything but remotely close to being an objective, trustworthy reporter. For example, just a few months ago, she compared the United States to North Korea. \n\n“I must say I was afraid. I’m a foreigner. I don’t have a green card. I’m not an American citizen. I’m fairly prominent, and I literally prepared to go to America as if I was going to North Korea,” she claimed. “I took a burner phone. Imagine that … not my mobile phone, not my iPad, nothing, and I had nothing on the burner phone except a few numbers.”\n\nThis is the definition of unhinged hyperbole. She also led the charge against the now-former CNN president, Chris Licht, by publicly blasting him for hosting then-candidate Donald Trump for a town hall in 2023 when he was easily leading in the polls for the Republican nomination. \n\nAmanpour would later argue that CNN should have taped and edited the Trump town hall to craft the proper narrative. This is exactly what CBS News did with Kamala Harris’s infamous 60 Minutes interview last October. That stunt ended up costing the network $15 million after the network settled a lawsuit with Trump. \n\n“So maybe less is more,” she said. “Maybe live [television] is not always right.”\n\nYes, because God forbid Trump says something even a liberal audience like CNN agrees with. \n\nBut matters really came to a head after Amanpour made the disgusting claim that Israeli hostages were actually treated relatively well during their two years in captivity under Hamas. \n\n“It’s been a terrible, terrible two years for them because not only are they there — you know, they’re probably being treated better than the average Gazan because they are the pawns and the chips that Hamas had,” Amanpour said. “Now Hamas has given up all its leverage, by the way, by giving them all up. So that is a victory for the Israeli side.”\n\n“…treated better than the average Gazan.” Uh-huh. Was the average Gazan forced to dig their own graves in tunnels underground? Was the average Gazan starved, electrocuted, or held in chains? \n\nOn Monday night, after overwhelming backlash, Amanpour apologized on social media for her remarks. \n\n“It was insensitive and wrong. From speaking to many former hostages and their families, like everyone, I’ve been horrified at what Hamas has subjected them to over two long years,” she wrote. \n\nOne has to wonder about Amanpour’s future at CNN at this point because apparently, she doesn’t think she’s biased in any way, shape, or form. \n\n“To be honest, Oliver, I never hear myself being called ‘partisan,” she told the hopelessly biased Oliver Darcy in an interview. “I am not an American, I don’t cover U.S. elections or domestic politics. I tell the truth and the stories from around the world, including what everyone over here thinks of America at any given time.”\n\nShe doesn’t cover politics? That’s weird, because besides publicly rebuking her own network for hosting Trump in a town hall setting in 2023, she also once defended Hillary Clinton after collapsing at a 9/11 memorial event before the 2016 presidential election, as her just having an “off day.” \n\n“Surely this can’t be a case of a human being having an off day,” Amanpour said sarcastically. “No, like so many things, Hillary, the media are having a field day. Off to the races with another debilitating case of indignant outrage. This must be another typical Clinton conspiracy to fool them with a total transparency breakdown.”\n\nNope. No bias there whatsoever. And here’s Amanpour back in 2020 comparing the Trump administration to the Nazis. \n\n“This week, 82 years ago, Kristallnacht happened,” Amanpour said in a CNN monologue. “It was the Nazis’ warning shot across the bow of our human civilization that led to genocide against a whole identity, and in that tower of burning books, it led to an attack on fact, knowledge, history, and truth. After four years of a modern-day assault on those same values by Donald Trump, the Biden-Harris team pledges a return to norms, including the truth.”\n\nAgain, Amanpour said she didn’t cover U.S. elections, right? And similar to she did with the Israeli hostages, she apologized for these remarks. Sort of.\n\n“I should not have juxtaposed the two thoughts. Hitler and his evils stand alone, of course, in history,” she explained. “I regret any pain my statement may have caused.”\n\nBut she just couldn’t leave it there. Instead, she defended the thought process in the most pious way possible.\n\n“My point was to say how democracy can potentially slip away, and how we must always zealously guard our democratic values,” she warned.\n\nYes. Because nothing says saving democracy quite like the Democrats weaponizing the justice system or installing candidates at the 11th hour, as the party did with Kamala Harris, without one vote from the public \n\nFor CNN, cutting ties with Amanpour has little downside. The network is already hemorrhaging viewers at an alarming rate. In prime time, despite a dizzying news cycle largely thanks to President Donald Trump, CNN is only averaging 543,000 viewers, which is down 36% from one year ago. In contrast, Fox News averaged more than 3.3 million viewers in prime time, or more than six times the audience of CNN. Amanpour reportedly makes $5 million per year, and the return on investment is low ratings and constant PR headaches like the one she’s causing this week in again showing her anti-Israel bias.\n\nI’m often asked if CBS News can be turned around by hiring Bari Weiss, a true journalist who created The Free Press from scratch to one of the most respected and read news sites in business. My answer is that the network can only change if the faces seen on it change. And until that happens, until the culture and presentation look and sound different, one person alone can’t change its failing direction.\n\nThe same goes for CNN. It tried to return to the center two years ago, but the inmates with microphones revolted against its network president in Licht. He was shown the door for having the audacity to give Trump an hour-long town hall.\n\n“You have every right to be outraged and angry and never watch this network again,” alleged anchor Anderson Cooper told viewers the night after Trump’s appearance, which he also called “disturbing.”\n\nLicht was ousted a few weeks later. Cooper kept his job. \n\nDEMOCRATS WANT THE GOP TO DESTROY NORMS\n\nIf CNN truly wants to earn viewers and readers’ trust, it’s time to take out the trash. \n\nAnd dumping Christiane Amanpour would be a very good start.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

Seth Moulton, D-Mass., launched his U.S. Senate campaign with a video called \"Lesson,\" referencing what his party learned during the last election cycle with then-President Joe Biden. \"We're in a crisis, and with everything we learned last election, I just don't believe Senator Markey should be running for another six-year term at 80 years old. Even more, I don't think someone who's been in Congress for half a century is the right person to meet this moment and win the future,\" Moulton said in his campaign launch video.

The move was criticized by some constituents who claimed Moulton's actions were sexist and ageist, according to Politico. In 2020, Markey defeated Rep. Joe Kennedy III, who was 40 at the time. Politico noted that Markey took a swipe at Kennedy with a riff on his great uncle's famous line, \"Ask not what your country can do for you — ask what you can do for your country.\" Markey also mocked the idea that he was too old to keep his seat, saying, \"With 500 laws on the books, you think I'm gonna stop now?

Charlie always talked about how ‘desires of the flesh’ aren’t fulfilling or making people happy. Instead of pursuing those things, we should turn ourselves toward higher purposes like family, marriage and God, because those are what truly fulfill people’s lives.\" \"I actually think most people are searching for something,\" she said. \"I think that searching should be directed toward God. But I think most people recognize nowadays that what the Left has to offer is not going to lead to a fulfilling life.\" Americans' happiness has taken a nosedive in recent years, with the U.S. falling eight spots in the 2024 World Happiness Report, which ranks countries' life satisfaction, due to American young adults reporting they are not satisfied compared to their parents' and grandparents' generations. Americans older than the age of 60 ranked number 10 for overall happiness, according to the study, while young adults under the age of 30 ranked 62nd internationally for happiness, CNBC reported in 2024. Suicide and depression rates have meanwhile skyrocketed in recent years, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting that one-in-five high school students seriously considered attempting suicide in 2023, with suicide jumping by 62% among young adults when comparing 2007 data to 2021 data. 'SLEEPING GIANT' LIKELY WOKE UP FOR TURNING POINT USA AFTER CHARLIE KIRK'S ASSASSINATION Amid the increasing rates of unhappiness among youths, Kirk landed under the national spotlight as a youth, himself, rallying his peers to embrace conservative and Christian values to find peace. \"Marriage isn't just a life milestone- it's a calling. God didn't say ‘wait until you feel ready.’ He said ‘it is not good for man to be alone.’ Get married young. Be fruitful and multiply,\" Kirk posted to Facebook just months before his death. His comments were even praised by Trump, who celebrated his message to young adults to get married. \"We have so many bad philosophies, ideologies, politics,\" Trump said on Fox News following Kirk's death. \"His was basically just good. He talked about family, he talked about getting married, ‘go get married. It sounds old-fashioned when you think about it, but he’s right.\" Kirk was shot and killed Sept. 10 during an outdoor event at Utah Valley University, the first stop on TPUSA’s planned \"American Comeback Tour.\" After news of Kirk’s killing spread across the country and world, some college students are choosing to carry on his legacy by echoing the values he championed and encouraging political debate among Gen Z peers. Oliver is one of those Gen Zers, a college senior and president of the university’s Right to Life group, a pro-life advocacy group. She told Fox News Digital that she believes open dialogue can help renew focus on Christian conservative values. Kirk \"dedicated his life to talking with other people respectfully and listening to them,\" she said. \"We desperately need more of that dialogue now, more than ever. In a world that has abandoned God and moral values, we have even abandoned the basic respect for other human beings and we need to reclaim it.\" Kirk often spoke of marriage, children and the importance of family — with his widow continuing the promotion of those values from the stage of his memorial service in Arizona in September. \"We have an uplifting message for America, one that is hopeful, one of family formation, one off church attendance going up one of business ownership of entrepreneurship,\" Kirk said on \"The Will Cain Show\" on May 2. \"Trump voters, young men, they want family, children, and legacy,\" Kirk added on the Ingraham Angle Sept. 8, only two days before he was killed. \"Young women who voted for Kamala Harris, they want careerism, consumerism, and loneliness. That is a dramatic divide that is going to play out in our politics for the years to come.\" Americans' pessimism toward the institution of marriage and family, however, currently outweighs their optimism, according to a September 2023 Pew Research Center report called, \"Public Has Mixed Views on the Modern American Family.\" \"Americans most often point to job satisfaction and close friends, rather than being married or having children, when asked what contributes to a fulfilling life,\" the report found. \"Some 71% say having a job or career they enjoy is extremely or very important for people to live a fulfilling life, and 61% say the same about having close friends. Only about a quarter say having children (26%) or being married (23%) is equally important.\" CHARLIE KIRK ANSWERED 'HOW DO YOU WANT TO BE REMEMBERED' LESS THAN 3 MONTHS BEFORE KILLING However, young adults are picking up the mantle of Kirk's promotion of traditional values as support for TPUSA continues to grow following his death. Since Kirk’s assassination, Boston University College Republicans Vice President Philip Wohltorf, who also works as a legislative aide in the Massachusetts State Senate, said his group has seen a drastic increase in attendance. Democratic groups on campus, however, have not been open to debating, he said, allowing anti-conservative sentiment to spread across the student body. \"We were thinking, well, the left is open-minded and tolerant, they want to talk,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, they don’t, and it doesn’t really help. I think it would be great on campus if we would have a civil, calm, challenging debate. It would show the student body that people can disagree with one another but still shake hands and be friends afterward.\" He said, \"America was founded on the principle of freedom of speech and dialogue, and nobody did it better than Charlie Kirk,\" as the cultural divide continues to widen. In a statement to Fox News Digital, the Boston University College Democrats said the group sent a \"polite decline\" to a debate request, explaining that it is \"very difficult to make debates worthwhile.\" \"We feel it is very difficult to make debates worthwhile for participants and viewers, so we decline them with everyone, not just Republicans,\" the group said. \"Freedom of speech is something we value greatly but we believe that open bipartisan collaboration is the path forward at this time.\" The group condemned all political violence, adding, \"Charlie Kirk should not have died. We believe everyone should be able to share their ideas and beliefs without fear.\" ANTI-TRUMP VOICES PRAISE CHARLIE KIRK'S LEGACY AFTER ASSASSINATION, SAY HE WAS DOING POLITICS 'THE RIGHT WAY' TPUSA exploded with new interest after Kirk’s memorial service, receiving more than 120,000 campus chapter requests, according to the organization. Prior to the memorial service, TPUSA had around 60,000 requests, Andrew Kolvet, executive producer of \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" recently said. TPUSA operates 900 official college chapters and approximately 1,200 high school chapters across the country. Wohltorf said more young people are standing by their values, pointing to faith and family as the most important priorities to many in his generation. \"I like the saying that people were now posting in the past two weeks talking about how one Charlie Kirk is gone but one hundred thousand new Charlie Kirks were just created,\" Wohltorf said. \"The majority of the conservative movement feels obligated to continue Charlie Kirk’s legacy and to continue to preach those family values, faith, and Christianity … I think that the majority conservative movement is even more likely to fight now and to speak out,\" Wohltorf said. CHARLIE KIRK PAINTED AS 'CONTROVERSIAL,' 'PROVOCATIVE' IN MEDIA’S ASSASSINATION COVERAGE CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Oliver and Wohltorf believe these values will continue to be upheld for years to come after this political turning point. They say they’re inspired by Kirk’s legacy to share their beliefs and not be afraid. \"I think the majority is trying to continue his legacy, feeling obligated to fight, feeling obligated to foster dialogue, debate, and challenge one another with ideas,\" Wohltorf said. \"Ultimately, Charlie said he wants to be remembered for his courage, for his faith, and I think that message is resounding very strongly with my generation,\" Oliver said. Trump posthumously awarded Kirk the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, Tuesday at the White House.

Democrat","text":"Sen. Alex Padilla apparently dreams of becoming California’s next governor. He’s thinking hard about entering the race to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom. And Katie Porter may have just opened the starting gate for him.\n\nPorter has been regarded as the early front-runner. But she tripped and stumbled badly during a contentious, unprofessional and rude performance in a recent routine TV interview that went viral.\n\nWe don’t know the extent of her injury. But it was certainly enough to make Padilla’s decision a lot easier. If he really deep down covets the job of governor, the time seems ripe to apply for it.\n\nPadilla wouldn’t need to vacate the Senate merely to run. He’d have what’s called a “free ride”: He doesn’t face reelection next year because his Senate term runs through 2028.\n\nBut a Senate seat is gold plated. No term limits — a job often for life. It offers prestige and power, with sway over a global array of issues.\n\nToothless in Senate\n\nWhy would Padilla trade that to become the governor whose state is plagued by homelessness, wildfires and unaffordable living for millions?\n\nFor starters, it’s not much fun these days to be in the toothless Senate minority as a Democrat.\n\nThe California governor has immense power over spending and taxes, the appointment of positions ranging from local fair board members to state Supreme Court justices and the fate of hundreds of bills passed each year by the Legislature.\n\nYou lead the most populous state and the world’s fourth-largest economy.\n\nThe office provides an automatic launching pad for anyone with presidential aspirations, such as the termed-out present occupant.\n\nAnyway, Padilla, 52, is a proud native Californian, raised in the San Fernando Valley with strong ties to the state.\n\nAnd he’s immensely qualified to be governor, having served well in local, state and federal branches of government: Los Angeles City Council, state Senate, California secretary of State and the U.S. Senate.\n\nThere has been speculation for weeks about his entering the gubernatorial race. And in a recent New York Times interview, he acknowledged: “I am weighing it.”\n\n“Look, California is home,” he said. “I love California. I miss California when I’m in Washington. And there’s a lot of important work to do there. … I’m just trying to think through: Where can I be most impactful.”\n\nHow long will he think? “The race is not until next year,” he said. “So that decision will come.”\n\nIt should come much sooner than next year in order to be elected governor in this far-flung state with its vast socio-economic and geographic diversity.\n\nFormer Democratic Rep. Porter from Orange County has been beating him and every announced candidate in the polls — although not by enough to loudly boast about.\n\nIn a September poll by Emerson College, 36% of surveyed voters said they were undecided about whom to support. Of the rest, 16% favored Porter and just 7% Padilla.\n\nIn an August survey by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, 38% were undecided. Porter led with 17%. The nearest Democrat at 9% was Xavier Becerra, former secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services, state attorney general and 12-term congressman. Padilla wasn’t listed.\n\nName recognition\n\nWhy Porter? She gained renown during congressional hearings while grilling corporate executives and using a white board. But mainly, I suspect, voters got to know her when she ran statewide for the U.S. Senate last year. She didn’t survive the primary, but her name familiarity did.\n\nBy contrast, Padilla has never had a tough top-of-the-ticket statewide race. He was appointed by Newsom to the Senate in 2021 to fill the vacancy created by Kamala Harris’ election as vice president.\n\nDemocratic strategist Garry South says it would be “risky” for Padilla to announce his candidacy unless he immediately became the front-runner. That’s because he’d need that status to attract the hefty campaign donations required to introduce himself to voters.\n\n“Unlike the governor, a California senator is not really that well known,” the strategist says. “And he hasn’t been a senator that long. I don’t think voters have a sense of him. In order to improve his [poll] numbers, he’s going to have to spend a lot of money. If he were an instant frontrunner, the money would flow. But if he jumps in with only half the votes [of the frontrunner], there’s no reason for money to flow.\n\n“And the longer he waits, the less time he has to raise the money.”\n\nPorter may have eased the way for Padilla.\n\nThe UC Irvine law professor came unglued when CBS Sacramento reporter Julie Watts asked what she’d tell California’s 6 million Donald Trump voters in order to win their needed support for governor. Porter reacted like a normal irritated person rather than a seasoned politician.\n\nShe tersely dismissed the question’s premise and replied that the GOP votes wouldn’t be needed.\nWhen the interviewer persisted, Porter lost her cool. “I don’t want to keep doing this. I’m going to call it,” she said, threatening to walk out. But she didn’t.\n\nIt was raw meat for her campaign opponents and they immediately pounced.\n\nFormer state Controller Betty Yee called on Porter to “leave this race” because she’s “a weak, self-destructive candidate unfit to lead California.”\n\nVeteran Democratic consultant Gale Kaufman, who’s not involved in the contest, says the TV flub “hurts her a lot because it goes to likability.”\n\nIf Padilla really longs for the job, he can stop dreaming and take advantage of a golden opportunity.\n\nGeorge Skelton is a Los Angeles Times columnist. ©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Archie was so little and I had just gotten pregnant with Lili around that same time.\n\n'So we were nesting. Nesting and healing. And also, I don't know if I had the bandwidth at that time to think about what the 'big picture' dream was. There was no plan.\n\n'It was just 'let's just get through these next couple of years', create community, which was always so important to both of us in our new environment.'\n\nShe added that as the couple started to get into producing, through their deal with Netflix, they were 'creating projects that we felt were compelling'.\n\nThe Duchess continued: 'Then I said 'OK, I've always loved being able to share, I've always loved being able to cook and entertain... is there a business here?'\n\n'And I think it was probably most people's assumption that if I was going to go into business it would be fashion and beauty.\n\n'But those five years at home – I wasn't running around wearing beautiful outfits, I was probably in Birkenstocks and sweats like the rest of us, especially during Covid, or just barefoot at home, but I was making a lot of jam.\n\n'So it ended up becoming the thing that really was my passion project that I turned into a business.'\n\nAlso yesterday, Meghan refused to say whether her Netflix show will return for a third season.\n\nThe Duchess's show With Love, Meghan first ran on Netflix in March before its second season in August and a 'holiday special' on the way next month.\n\nMeghan gives hosting tips and cooks with her celebrity friends in the show, but it has been savaged by critics amid question marks over whether it will be renewed.\n\nAt the summit, she was asked whether With Love, Meghan will come back for season three. But she did not give a clear indication, saying: 'The holiday special is coming out in November and that's it's a really good one.\n\n'So we're able to say eight episodes for two seasons, it's a lot of work. I also recognise how much people want content in different sizes.\n\n'So part of what we're testing out now is: it's amazing to be able to sit and watch a show for 30 minutes, but how can I give you a recipe in two minutes, and where can I share that with you, and how that continues to grow As Ever.\n\n'So, exploring all the options of what it could look like.'\n\nMeghan then gave further detail about her show's upcoming holiday special, saying she does 'lots of gift wrapping techniques'.\n\n'You guys know I used to teach gift wrapping at Paper Source and advanced gift wrapping,' she said.\n\n'So you know, all of those things that you do as an auditioning actor. That's not the full circle I was expecting, but here we are.'\n\nMeghan also said she is 'grateful' for the partnership with Netflix, adding it has been 'incredible' for her As Ever brand which sells flower sprinkles, pre-prepared baking kits and jam.\n\n'What we've designed is being able to have so much robust support in year one, where you have the show complementing the brand or content and commerce or meeting, and then still enabling me to have autonomy, to build out my own team and scale it in the way that I envision,' she said.\n\nShe added the partnership means 'the business will, of course, go on longer than a series'.\n\nWhen asked whether her As Ever goods will soon be available in stores, the Duchess said she may look to strike a partnership with large retailers 'in the next couple of years'.\n\n'My intention with as ever is getting back to things that are tactile, how we connect with each other. And you can only convey so much of that, obviously, in videos or in e-commerce.\n\n'So I think my intention would be to have really bespoke, small retail collaborations, do some interesting ones as well in global territories, and then, of course, as you think about scaling, you know, it's a brand that's accessible, but it still has a quality that feels as though it's masstige.\n\n'And so when we think about larger retailers, I think in the next couple years, that would make sense.'\n\nMeghan also spoke about her plans to 'leverage her significant influence to build a successful, long-lasting business empire'.\n\nThe Duchess was wearing a Gabriela Hearst blouse, earrings by Polene, and a Dior ring she had made for her son Archie's christening.\n\nThe Sussexes previously described their latest deal with Netflix, which is also a partner in As Ever, as 'extending their creative partnership'.\n\nThe nature of the deal means Netflix can say yes or no to film or TV projects before anyone else.\n\nBut PR and crisis expert Mark Borkowski called it a 'downgrade,' and suggested Netflix had 'done a very neat job of pivoting away from two very expensive people who didn't deliver'.\n\nThe launch of series one of With Love, Meghan in March coincided with the unveiling of her As Ever brand, with her first products including her raspberry jam, and the flower sprinkles she repeatedly promotes throughout the show.\n\nBut the eight-part series, which sees the duchess give hosting tips and cooking with her celebrity friends, was savaged by critics.\n\nOne review in the Guardian described it as a 'gormless lifestyle filler' and 'so pointless it might be the Sussexes' last TV show', while the Telegraph gave it two stars and branded it 'insane' and an 'exercise in narcissism'.\n\nThe couple's other major media deal with Spotify ended in 2023 after one season of Meghan's podcast Archetypes, with one of the streaming giant's executives later branding them 'grifters'.\n\nYesterday's summit chat – titled Next Level Influence: A Conversation With Meghan, Duchess of Sussex – was hosted by Fortune's editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell.\n\nThe Duchess also told Ms Shontell that she flew home to California from Europe for just one day before heading to New York, because she needed to see her 'babies'.\n\nMeghan travelled solo to Paris for the Balenciaga show on October 4, ahead of a string of appearances last week with Harry in New York.\n\nIn Washington yesterday, Meghan said she made a 6,000-mile dash home for a brief reunion with Prince Archie, six, and Princess Lilibet, four, instead of heading straight to the Big Apple.\n\nMs Shontell said to the Duchess: 'You've been to Europe. You were just in New York, which, congratulations, you just won a humanitarian award for your work with online safety for parents and children, and you made it home for one day to see your kids.'\n\nMeghan laughed and replied: 'Because I had to. We were talking about that because everyone said 'Oh you must have gone from Paris straight to New York'.\n\n'I said 'No, I need to see my babies'. So I went back to California for a day and then continued on.'\n\nThis year's speakers at the annual event also included actress Selena Gomez, former US Vice-President Kamala Harris and Washington DC mayor Muriel Bowser.","summary":"The Duchess of Sussex stepped back as a senior working royal and started a new life in the US with her husband Prince Harry when their son Prince Archie was ten months old.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/royals/article-15193741/Meghan-Markle-Love-Netflix-season-three-Royal-Family.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/15/09/103000669-0-image-m-19_1760515262055.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/14/1599501315883121917/1024x576_MP4_1599501315883121917.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-15 09:55:00","author":"Editor,Mark Duell","authors":["Editor","Mark Duell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.208},{"id":369416312,"title":"Time for a Blue-State “Soft Secession”?","text":"The government shutdown isn’t hitting everywhere equally—infrastructure projects that rely on federal funding have been halted exclusively in states that voted for Kamala Harris.

I didn’t think it would happen—I thought Israel would fully ethnically cleanse the place, and then do the same thing to the West Bank, and Trump would not care. And one should not overstate the achievement here. There were two previous ceasefires negotiated under Joe Biden, under which many more hostages were released. The war may well start up again soon, just like it did after the other ceasefires.\n\nIndeed, as I was drafting this article, Israel was already violating the ceasefire terms by shooting several people and cutting the amount of aid let into Gaza in half, supposedly in retaliation for Hamas not producing hostage bodies fast enough. (Hamas claims it is working as fast as it can without digging equipment or electricity.)\n\nStill, at the time of writing at least, the ceasefire hasn’t broken, and it appears likely that the rest of the hostages, or their remains, will be released soon. If that happens, a key excuse for Israel’s prolongation of the war will be gone. Though there is no sign of a permanent settlement, much less any prospect of Palestinians getting civil rights, this is the best news we’ve had in the last two years.\n\nAnd it all happened because Trump got mad and leaned on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It proves beyond any doubt that President Joe Biden could have ended this conflict for good more than a year ago.\n\nNow, Biden almost certainly would have had a much more difficult time getting Israel, and particularly Netanyahu, to play ball than Trump did. Bibi is a paid-up member of the global network of right-wing authoritarians, and has the staggering corruption scandals to prove it. As we’ve seen with Trump and Jair Bolsonaro, or Trump and Javier Milei, or Elon Musk and Tommy Robinson, or Musk and Vladimir Putin, these people instinctively work together to protect each other and advance their mutual interests. They have a vision of the future, and it’s a boot stamping on a human face—forever.\n\nIndeed, Netanyahu is not just a friendly aspiring autocrat—he openly campaigns for Republican policies and politicians. In 2002 he told Congress there was “no question” Saddam Hussein was working on nuclear weapons; in 2012 he campaigned for Mitt Romney, and in 2015 he gave a speech to Congress attempting to derail President Obama’s nuclear deal with Iran. Netanyahu celebrated Trump’s victory in 2016—which indeed led to the nuclear deal being torn up, as well as the American embassy being moved to Jerusalem—and tried to help him in 2020 and 2024. It’s no surprise that Netanyahu would be more willing to listen to Trump than Biden.\n\nThat said, it appears that Trump did have to apply serious pressure to get this deal through. The New York Times reports that he had more or less let Netanyahu do whatever he wanted, spending weeks on his bewilderingly goofy idea that the U.S. could annex Gaza itself, until the Israeli military hit Qatar with a missile strike. This massive overreach infuriated Trump, who rounded up support from the Gulf states, hauled Netanyahu into the White House, and forced him to get on the phone and read an apology to the Qatari prime minister. (It’s not for nothing that Trump wants to maintain good relations with Qatar, the country that gifted him with a luxury jet to become the new Air Force One.)\n\nBut that is just to say Israel is a small country in a dangerous neighborhood, while America is the global hegemon providing it with vital money, weapons, and diplomatic cover. When the U.S. president chooses to apply pressure in such a situation, it tends to work. Trump didn’t have to do much, but he also barely touched the levers of diplomatic pressure available to him. And while Biden would have had to push hard, he should have assumed from the start of his presidency that Netanyahu would do all he could to undermine his policy and get him replaced with a Republican, because that’s what Netanyahu does to every Democrat.\n\nWhen the U.S. president chooses to apply pressure in such a situation, it tends to work.\n\nBiden didn’t do that. He, and the rest of his administration, carried out a criminally stupid “bear hug” strategy of enabling Netanyahu at every turn. When USAID and the State Department’s refugees bureau concluded that Israel was deliberately restricting food and water from entering Gaza, Secretary of State Antony Blinken buried the report and lied to Congress about what he knew, so weapons sales to Israel could continue—and in any case, it wasn’t some great mystery, as it was obvious people were starving. Even when Biden himself set a red line in public, saying Rafah should not be invaded, and the IDF proceeded to do just that, the only consequence was temporarily pausing the delivery of 2,000-pound MK-84 bombs that were totally useless except for maximizing civilian casualties and which Israel had already received in huge numbers in any case.\n\nTo anyone with a passing familiarity with the history of Israel-Palestine, it was obvious that the Israeli reaction to the October 7 attacks would be murderous collective punishment. Within a week, this was an undeniable fact. Biden would have been entirely justified in applying heavy and intensifying pressure to end the conflict by that point. Likely all that would have been necessary is credibly threatening to cut off supplies of weapons, which, in fact, is required by American law. (That’s why Blinken lied.)\n\nIt’s impossible to say with any certainty what Biden’s calamitous failure has cost America and the world. At the very least, tens of thousands of Gazans would be alive today. Ukraine might be in significantly better shape, as weapons that ended up blowing Gazan children to bits could have gone to fight Russian aggression instead. It’s not impossible that Kamala Harris would be president today; while there’s little evidence that people directly refusing to vote for her because of Gaza made up Trump’s margin of victory, the genocide did badly split the Democratic coalition, deflect attention from Biden’s very real domestic achievements, and badly demoralize the left.\n\nWhatever the case, this is Joe Biden’s legacy. Almost all his highly promising infrastructure and climate programs have gone in the trash. All he’ll be remembered for now is being beaten at humanitarian diplomacy by Donald Trump.","summary":"It’s America’s worst foreign policy disaster since the invasion of Iraq.","url":"https://prospect.org/world/2025-10-15-gaza-israel-joe-biden-peace-failure/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/23677/download/Biden%20cooper.jpg?cb=23190df010b33e73aadf1dba4de66fbe&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 09:00:00","author":"Ryan Cooper","authors":["Ryan Cooper"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.478},{"id":369417666,"title":"Salesforce CEO who backed National Guard deployment previously funded protest-industrial complex","text":"“We don’t have enough cops, so if they can be cops, I’m all for it,” Benioff said of the federal troops, adding that he “fully supports the president” and thinks Trump is “doing a great job.”\n\nTrump is turning to the National Guard as both a crime-fighting force and a riot response squadron for quelling the nationwide uprisings against Immigration and Customs Enforcement, namely in sanctuary cities. The anti-ICE unrest also reached San Francisco, which has its own sanctuary ordinance prohibiting local law enforcement from assisting federal immigration authorities.\n\nBenioff’s comments came ahead of his annual Dreamforce conference in downtown San Francisco, a large-scale event requiring expansive security services. In the interview, Benioff bemoaned that he has to pay out of pocket for hundreds of off-duty police officers to patrol the area around the convention.\n\n“You’ll see. When you walk through San Francisco next week, there will be cops on every corner,” Benioff said. “That’s how it used to be.”\n\nBenioff’s call to restore law and order signifies a political about-face for the left-leaning billionaire and his philanthropic work.\n\nUnder Benioff, Salesforce handed over the keys to its global funding vehicle to a dark money network bankrolling disruptive protest politics across America.\n\nIn 2014, Benioff co-pioneered Pledge 1%, a corporate philanthropy model in which companies that take the pledge commit at least one percent of profits to charitable causes, preferably with “equitable” aims.\n\nPledge 1%, seeded by Benioff, acts as a corporate giving pipeline directing the flow of funds to such social justice initiatives. Since its inception, Pledge 1% has generated more than $3 billion from over 19,000 participating companies around the world, with the goal of “embedding social impact into the DNA of all businesses.”\n\nSalesforce ultimately ceded control of Pledge 1%’s infrastructure to the Tides Foundation, one of the largest left-wing grantmaking operations in the U.S., responsible for funding agitation-style activism.\n\n“It’s now managed by Tides and they work with [companies] one-on-one and tell you exactly what to do,” Salesforce’s chief philanthropy officer, Ebony Beckwith, told TechCrunch in a 2019 interview.\n\nAccording to the Tides website, which describes its takeover of Pledge 1% as the venture’s fiscal sponsor and “thought partner,” Tides administers donor-advised funds, or charitable investment accounts, on behalf of these companies and offers financial guidance on “how/where to invest their philanthropic dollars.”\n\nTides, a pass-through funder of left-of-center organizations, has financed various activist activities connected to political upheaval, including giving grants to pro-Palestinian groups that stoked widespread chaos on major U.S. college campuses in 2023.\n\n“Salesforce’s funneling of funds through Tides is precisely how corporate philanthropy can feed the protest-industrial complex,” said Seamus Bruner, the director of research at the Government Accountability Institute.\n\nFrom 2022 to 2024, the Salesforce Foundation, the company’s 501(c)(3) offshoot, directly gave various Tides entities a total of $27.4 million in grant money, according to tax filings, though those donations were earmarked for a wide range of vaguely described causes, such as “employment opportunities,” “general support,” “youth development,” and “solving homelessness.”\n\nFollowing backlash from city officials over his commentary urging the National Guard’s deployment, Benioff announced that he is “doubling down on San Francisco” and that Salesforce is investing $15 billion over the next five years to “build a greater, safer city for everyone.” Through a private-public partnership with San Francisco, an additional $1 million will cover hiring bonuses for newly enlisted police officers, Benioff added.\n\nHowever, he backtracked on welcoming federal intervention in San Francisco, saying that public safety is “first and foremost, the responsibility of our city and state leaders.”\n\n“Whether Mr. Benioff intended it or not, his firm has helped bankroll the very networks now roiling cities,” Bruner told the Washington Examiner. “His recent call, which he has since softened, for President Trump to deploy the National Guard in San Francisco underscores how politically fraught this all has become.”\n\nIt is unclear why Benioff, who had donated hefty sums to the respective presidential runs of Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris, appears to have suddenly changed his heart on Trump and his administration’s agenda. Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn September, Benioff sat across from Trump during a state dinner at Windsor Castle hosted by King Charles. As the Salesforce head was quoted as saying in the New York Times, Benioff repeatedly told Trump, “How grateful [Benioff is] for everything he’s doing.”\n\nA number of Silicon Valley playmakers have lined up in a similar fashion to heap public praise upon the president, rubbing elbows with him at high-profile events. Apple CEO Tim Cook gifted Trump a 24-karat gold piece in an August trip to the Oval Office. OpenAI’s chief executive, Sam Altman, told Trump he was “a very refreshing change” at a White House gala for tech tycoons.","summary":"Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, a longtime Democratic mega donor, is backing President Donald Trump on sending in the National Guard to San Francisco, after helping to heavily fund what dark money watchdogs call the protest-industrial complex.

As a result, right-of-center voices have been drowned out in a region that was once a proud home to pragmatic Republican giants. But in New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District (NH-1), the 2026 midterms now offer a rare opening to send a Republican to Washington.\n\nThe decision of New Hampshire Democratic Senator Jeanne Shaheen to not run for reelection in 2026 has prompted Democratic Congressman Chris Pappas to pursue a Senate run, which will leave his current seat in the U.S. House representing NH-1 open. NH-1, a nearly 700,000-person mosaic of coastal progressivism and rural conservatism, is now a battleground district. As President Trump’s second term pushes bold reforms, a GOP victory in the region could fortify the House majority and signal a conservative resurgence in Yankee territory.\n\nNew Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District backed Joe Biden by 7 points in 2020 and Kamala Harris by a mere 3 in 2024, earning a Cook Partisan Voter Index of D+2 — hardly an insurmountable blue tilt, especially with independents making up 40% of the electorate in New Hampshire. Democrats have clung to the NH-1 seat in the House since 2013, but Pappas’s departure unleashes chaos: A fractious Democratic primary for his seat features Seacoast figures like former Rep. Maura Sullivan, state Sen. Stefany Shaheen, and activist Carleigh Beriont, risking an eventual nominee battered by internal leftist infighting.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, are building momentum. Early entrants include businesswoman Hollie Noveletsky and state legislators like Rep. Brian Cole. The field gained steam when Chris Bright withdrew to endorse Anthony DiLorenzo, a prominent and forceful Portsmouth businessman and noted UNH donor who is seriously considering a run. DiLorenzo, with his entrepreneurial track record in development and philanthropy, is likely to jump in soon and could excel by appealing to voters weary of Washington insiders, channeling a no-nonsense approach to economic growth.\n\nTo triumph in New Hampshire in November 2026, Republicans seeking the NH-1 seat must navigate the state’s unique GOP dynamics while advancing a robust conservative agenda. A core challenge lies in uniting the party’s pro-Trump loyalists, who demand strong stances on immigration and America First economics, with anti-Trump moderates, who prioritize moderation and bristle at MAGA rhetoric.\n\nThe divided landscape of right-of-center voters in NH-1 was highlighted during the 2024 election cycle, when Republican House candidate Russell Prescott captured 46% of the vote (185,936 ballots), trailing Democratic incumbent Chris Pappas’s 54% (218,577 ballots). Yet Donald Trump fared slightly better in the district, securing 48% to Kamala Harris’s 50%, suggesting roughly 8,200 Democratic-leaning voters split their tickets by backing the Democrat Pappas down-ballot while crossing over to Trump at the top of the ticket — a testament to the district’s independent-minded electorate.\n\nA Republican nominee can seek to flip NH-1 and consolidate the party base by taking a look at Governor Kelly Ayotte’s balanced conservatism: She is staunch on fiscal restraint and border security but collaborative on local issues and sensitive to Republican moderates. DiLorenzo, as a fresh-faced businessman untethered to factional wars, could thrive here, drawing Trump enthusiasts with his business credentials while reassuring Sununu-style moderate GOPers through his focus on job creation.\n\nIssue selection must highlight priorities tailored to Granite State realities. Skyrocketing housing costs, child care shortages, job security and growth, and energy price surges dominate concerns. Candidates should champion Trump-inspired deregulation, tax cuts, and energy independence to support small businesses and families. On immigration, tying lax border policies to NH-1’s opioid epidemic can mobilize conservatives in areas like Belknap and Carroll counties, where Republicans enjoy strong support. However, candidates must tread carefully, framing cultural issues as defenses against progressive overreach rather than leaning into divisive battles that risk alienating suburban voters. At the same time, linking Trump’s achievements — like trade deals that boost manufacturing — to NH-1’s key issues can rally Republicans while addressing local priorities.\n\nEffective voter outreach will be crucial to winning NH-1. To rally conservative strongholds where support is robust, candidates can build on the Republican-controlled state legislature’s voter access reforms — such as streamlined absentee ballot processes — to promote mail-in voting through targeted GOP outreach in these communities, alongside local events like town halls. National committees, defending their narrow House edge, should allocate $5 million – $10 million to ads contrasting hallmark Democrat disorder in the political and social spheres with GOP solutions that are pro-business, pro-family, pro-law and order. Targeted digital outreach on platforms like X can sway swing independents who leaned Republican in 2024. Unified, these efforts could clinch a 2 to 4-point win, replicating triumphs in similar districts.\n\nA NH-1 Republican victory would herald a conservative pushback in New England, a bastion of liberal excess where the GOP once flourished with principled leaders like New Hampshire’s James Cleveland in the mid-20th century. This flip would be the first GOP House gain in New England since 2018, affirming that economic populism and cultural conservatism can breach the blue wall. Nationally, it strengthens House Republicans to advance President Trump’s agenda on fiscal discipline and national security. Regionally, it inspires neighboring states. Massachusetts, mired in one-party Democratic rule that has fueled high taxes and regulatory burdens, could learn from New Hampshire’s model — fielding pragmatic conservatives who unite factions to challenge seats like Massachusetts’ 9th Congressional District.\n\nA savvy candidate who can flip this seat could ignite a conservative spark and nudge Massachusetts to rethink its one-party playbook of Democrat disarray.\n\nKristin Tate is a political columnist and author based in Massachusetts.

During her campaign, she avoided using the term “genocide,” though in October 2024 she agreed with a student protester at the University of Wisconsin who made that accusation. “What he’s talking about — it’s real,” Harris said at the time. “It’s not the issue I came to discuss today, but it’s real, and I respect his voice.” Pushback, protests, and a book tour Harris has faced significant protest throughout the launch of her new memoir, \"107 Days,\" which chronicles her brief presidential campaign following Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the race. Pro-Palestinian demonstrators disrupted multiple events, accusing her of being a “war criminal” and “complicit in genocide.” In one instance in Washington, she told protesters: “I’m not the president of the United States. If you want to protest, go to the White House.” In Chicago, when faced with chants of “Kamala is a killer,” she responded: “Then let’s talk about the legacy of mass deportations, of voter suppression, of Donald Trump.” Footage of these confrontations, widely circulated on X by pro-Palestinian groups in the U.S., showed protesters blaming Harris for supporting the war, referencing the $20 billion U.S. arms deal with Israel approved in August 2024. In one event, a woman wearing a hijab was filmed screaming, “Kamala, this is all your fault. You supported genocide,” before being escorted out by security. Criticism of Trump and Biden In a packed auditorium in New York’s Times Square, Harris turned her criticism to Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. “Donald Trump gave Netanyahu a blank check to do whatever he wanted,” she said, receiving applause from the crowd. She reminded the audience that, during her vice presidency, she was the first in the administration to speak publicly about hunger in Gaza — a speech that drew sharp rebuke from the White House five months after the October 7 Hamas attack. In interviews and in her book, Harris levels pointed criticism at Biden, alleging that Netanyahu “undermined the president” during the war in an effort to return Trump to office. “Biden’s loyalty to Israel was rejected by its prime minister,” she wrote. “He wanted Trump across the table, not Joe. Not me.” She recounted pleading with Biden to show empathy for Palestinians comparable to his support for Ukrainians, but said she “hit a wall.” 'Binary thinking' and political consequences In \"107 Days,\" Harris writes that she lost the swing state of Michigan due to opposition from Arab American voters and criticizes what she calls “binary thinking” around the conflict. “Few are willing to hold two tragic narratives in their minds — to mourn both Israeli and Palestinian suffering,” she wrote. She also described how, after a speech in Alabama warning of famine in Gaza, she “took heavy fire from the White House” for stepping outside the administration’s official line. In the same MSNBC interview, Harris was asked whether Trump deserved credit for brokering the ceasefire and hostage release. She replied: “I really do hope it becomes real and that the hostages are out, that Gaza is no longer being treated with such brutality of force, that aid goes in. And I commend the people who have been a part of this process. I commend the Qataris, the Egyptians and the president.” A day later, Harris issued an official statement: \"I am thankful and deeply encouraged that this ceasefire has brought long-awaited moments of joy and reunion — as 20 Israeli hostages are finally reunited with their loved ones and Palestinian families and the people of Gaza begin to receive desperately needed relief from unimaginable suffering.\" She added: \"There is still much more work to do to secure a lasting peace, ensure the safety and dignity of every innocent life, and build a future where Israelis and Palestinians can live side by side in freedom and security.\" Harris’ comments triggered mixed reactions within the Democratic Party, which has remained divided over support for Israel since the 2024 election loss. While Sen. Bernie Sanders previously described Israel’s actions as “genocide,” Harris is the most senior party figure so far to publicly raise the question in such direct terms.","summary":"Biden's vice president, who lost last year's election to Trump, addresses claim that Israel is committing genocide directly for first time: 'Look at the number of innocent children and civilians killed'; In new book describing her presidential run, she says Netanyahu 'undermined Biden' during the war to help Trump win and criticizes the president who replaced him for refusing her request to 'show empathy for the Palestinians'","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/article/sjih7a2pee","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2024/11/07/SJIsi89Zyl/SJIsi89Zyl_29_0_2961_2000_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 07:24:26","author":"Daniel Edelson, New York","authors":["Daniel Edelson, New York"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":0.123},{"id":369417578,"title":"‘America First’ is becoming ‘Trump First’ as the president eyes global power","text":"Donald Trump has his finger in an awful lot of global pies for a president who was supposed to put America first.\n\nTrump on Tuesday threatened to disarm Hamas if it didn’t give up its weapons in Gaza, raising speculation about a US military role, and crowed about obliterating another speedboat off Venezuela in his legally dubious war against drug cartels.\n\nIn the middle of a US government shutdown that he claims forced him to fire hundreds of federal workers for lack of funds, he dangled a $20 billion economic bailout for Argentina — but only if voters there shore up his scandal-hit populist pal President Javier Milei.\n\nTrump also publicly tossed around Ukraine’s desire for him to send Tomahawk cruise missiles that could strike deep inside Russia.

But his Middle East breakthrough mirrored the legacy of an ultra-traditionalist GOP Atlanticist, President George H.W. Bush.\n\nThe erratic Trump is impossible to pin down ideologically. And his imperious personality means his foreign policy is often no more complex than a feral desire to exert his own power over whoever is sitting opposite.\n\n“Our plan will put America first. Americanism, not globalism, will be our credo. As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America first, then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect,” Trump said at his 2016 Republican National Convention address in Cleveland.\n\nHe fleshed out his views in his first address to the UN General Assembly a year later, pledging the US would flex nation-state power rather than work through international institutions and traditional alliance structures. “As president of the United States, I will always put America first, just like you, as the leaders of your countries, will always, and should always, put your countries first,” he said.\n\nIn his second term, as he smashes constitutional and legal restraints at home, he’s added a new dimension to his foreign policy — seeking to secure personal prestige, his legacy, a Nobel Peace Prize and a place among the world’s most powerful strongmen.\n\nSometimes, it feels like “America First” has become Trump first.\n\nThe president also sees the world with a businessman’s eye, seeking deals and financial openings for the United States and sometimes for his family empire. His vision for Gaza is as much a development proposition as a humanitarian one. The driving force behind some of Trump’s over-hyped claims to have ended many wars — some that weren’t even raging — is economic advantage and access to key minerals and rare earth metals over which China currently has a stranglehold.\n\nAt the same time, Trump and his Vice President JD Vance strive to promote global populism, even at the cost of undermining centrist governments, like those in Britain, France and Germany, whose leaders he likes.\n\nHow Trump’s policies fit into his unique blueprint\n\nThe official explanation for Trump’s bailout offer to Argentina is that its reeling economy poses a risk of contagion that could rock South America and even spread to the United States. This might be true. But Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent made no attempt Tuesday to hide the real motivation: to give a leg up to a right-wing ally who wrote the blueprint for the conflagration the president ignited under the federal bureaucracy and who appeared on stage early this year with former DOGE chief Elon Musk and a chainsaw.\n\n“He’s MAGA all the way. It’s ‘Make Argentina Great Again’,” Trump as he hosted Milei at the White House. The Argentine leader is also a past Mar-a-Lago guest.\n\n“If he wins, we’re staying with him,” Trump said. “And if he doesn’t win, we’re gone.”\n\nIn normal times, Trump’s flaunting of billions of dollars in US taxpayer money to effectively try to bribe voters in Argentina’s midterm elections in blatant interference in a foreign country’s election would trigger a major scandal. It’s reminiscent of Trump’s threat to make military aid to Ukraine contingent on it opening an investigation into Biden, which got him impeached.\n\nBut when everything is an outrage, nothing is.\n\nTrump was forced to confront the apparent contradiction between the MAGA philosophy and bailing out a foreign nation when a reporter asked in the meeting with Milei, “How is this Argentina rescue package ‘America First’?” His waffling answer didn’t really identify any other reason than offering a political favor.\n\nBut the Argentina initiative does play into a broader Trump priority — a global great game for influence, economic primacy and power against China, which has been vying with the US to get access to Argentine lithium and copper and recently undercut US farmers by buying Argentinian soybeans.\n\nThat desire to reshape the politics of the Western Hemisphere — much as Trump is trying to transform the Middle East — is also partly behind unilateral US military attacks on alleged cartel targets off Venezuela.\n\nThe one-sided application of vast military force is faithful to one MAGA principle: the attempt to crack down on the trafficking of fentanyl, which has killed thousands of Americans, an issue that helped Trump bond with working-class voters. But the campaign — which US critics argue amounts to extra-judicial killings that flout the authority of Congress to declare war — looks increasingly like a hard-power geopolitical play to destabilize the government of President Nicolás Maduro. Venezuela’s economic crisis and repression sent huge migrant flows to the US.\n\nTrump’s triumph in returning the Israeli hostages and ending the fighting in Gaza is a more traditional US foreign policy win than most of his international ventures. After all, US presidents have been mediating the Israel-Palestinian conflict, mostly unsuccessfully, for decades.\n\nBut the venture could clash with MAGA principles if US troops get drawn into Gaza. Trump warned Tuesday that if Hamas didn’t lay down its arms “we will disarm them.” He didn’t say how. But until the establishment of an international security force for the strip promised in his 20-point peace plan, his comment will raise speculation about a deeper role than the coordination and logistical mission some US personnel are expected to conduct in Israel. US involvement would conjure concerns among Trump supporters over the possible Middle East quagmires that helped to nurture his political movement in the first place.\n\n“Everything is possible with (Trump),” said Andrew Miller, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Israeli Palestinian affairs in the Biden administration.\n\n“But one of the central planks that he’s run on since he emerged on the scene has been staying out of Middle East wars,” Miller said on “CNN News Central.” “If we do wind up in in a scenario with a major US military contingent in Gaza, of all places, I think that’s going to test his support from his base.”","summary":"Donald Trump has his finger in an awful lot of global pies for a president who was supposed to put America first.

Receiving the award on Kirk’s behalf was his widow, Erika. Her voice cracking and often falling to a whisper as she wiped away tears, Erika Kirk talked about her late husband’s life, political beliefs and legacy. “Thank you, Mr. President, for honoring my husband, in such a profound and meaningful way. And thank you for making this event a priority,” she said. “Your support of our family and the work that Charlie devoted his life to will be something I cherish forever.” The ceremony coincided with what would have been Kirk’s 32nd birthday. It came about a month after the Turning Point USA founder was fatally shot while speaking to a crowd at Utah Valley University. In a sign of Kirk’s close ties to the administration, he was the first recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in Trump’s second term. The president also spoke at Kirk’s funeral in September, calling him a “great American hero” and “martyr” for freedom, while Vice President JD Vance accompanied his body home to Arizona on Air Force Two along with Erika Kirk. “We’re here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, beloved leader who galvanized the next generation like nobody I’ve ever seen before, and an American patriot of the deepest conviction, the finest quality and the highest caliber,” Trump said during the medal ceremony. Of Kirk’s killing, the president said: “He was assassinated in the prime of his life for boldly speaking the truth, for living his faith and relentless fighting for a better and stronger America.” The Presidential Medal of Freedom was established by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 for individuals making exceptional contributions “to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.” Trump returned to the U.S. in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday after a whirlwind trip to Israel and Egypt to celebrate a ceasefire agreement in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza that his administration was instrumental in brokering. The president joked that he almost requested to reschedule the ceremony because of the trip. “I raced back halfway around the globe,” Trump said. “I was going to call Erika and say, ‘Erika, could you maybe move it to Friday?’ And I didn’t have the courage to call. But you know why I didn’t call? Because I heard today was Charlie’s birthday.” Argentine President Javier Milei, who had been visiting with the president at the White House earlier, stayed on to attend the ceremony. Trump has awarded a string of presidential medals going back to his first term, including to golf legend Tiger Woods, ex-football coach Lou Holtz and conservative economist Arthur Laffer as well as to Yankees Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, the latter of which came during the 2020 State of the Union. He awarded posthumous medals to Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley. This term, Trump has also announced his intentions to award the medals to Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and a close former adviser, and to Ben Carson, who served as Trump’s first-term secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Kirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 and Trump praised him as one of the key reasons he was reelected last year. But Kirk’s politics were also often divisive. He sharply criticized gay and transgender rights while inflaming racial tensions. Kirk also repeated Trump’s false claims that former Vice President Kamala Harris was responsible for policies that encouraged immigrants to come to the U.S. illegally and called George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a Minneapolis police officer sparked a national debate over racial injustice, a “scumbag.” As Tuesday’s ceremony was underway, the Trump administration said it had revoked the visas of six foreigners who U.S. officials deemed had made derisive or mocking comments about Kirk’s assassination. The six who had their visas revoked were from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa. The move comes as the Trump administration and its supporters have zeroed in on people who made critical comments about Kirk, leading to firings and other discipline. Trump wrote in a social media post hours before it started that he was moving the ceremony from the White House’s East Room to the Rose Garden to accommodate a crowd he said would be “so big and enthusiastic.” Trump paved over the grass there and put in a patio area, and talked happily about the medal ceremony being one of the first major events in the new space. He noted how the weather had cleared up after it was expected to be raining, saying: “I was telling Erika, God was watching. And he didn’t want that for Charlie.” Kirk’s widow said she asked their 3-year-old daughter what she might have given her father for his birthday, and she responded a stuffed animal and a cupcake while saying he hoped he’d get a birthday surprise.

'It's... Antony Blinken, who achieved nothing other than fueling, encouraging and justifying the Israeli war.' \n\nHe went on to call Mitchell and Blinken 'two lifelong DC denizens and Israel loyalists slobbering over each other.'\n\nFellow journalist Joe Concha also blasted Mitchell's response.\n\n'That time Andrea Mitchell thanks Blinken and Biden over [current Secretary of State Marco] Rubio and Trump for the peace deal in Gaza,' he wrote. 'Just incredible.'\n\nOther X users also chimed in, with one person lamenting that Mitchell's post demonstrates the 'sad, sad state of journalism.'\n\n'You're embarrassing yourself, Andrea,' he wrote. 'Go home.' \n\nTrump has otherwise been widely praised for the ceasefire deal, with Time Magazine hailing the agreement as the 'signature achievement' of his second term.\n\n'The living Israeli hostages held in Gaza have been freed under the first phase of Donald Trump's peace plan, alongside a Palestinian prisoner release,' Time wrote alongside a picture of its new cover. \n\nIt added that the deal 'could mark a strategic turning point for the Middle East.' \n\nBiden also applauded his successor for getting the deal across the finish line. \n\n'The road to this deal was not easy,' Biden wrote on X. \n\n'My Administration worked relentlessly to bring hostages home, get relief to Palestinian civilians, and end the war.\n\n'I commend President Trump and his team for their work to get a renewed ceasefire deal over the finish line.\n\n'I am deeply grateful and relieved that this day has come – for the last living 20 hostages who have been through unimaginable hell and are finally reunited with their families and loved ones.'\n\nBiden said he was also overjoyed 'for the civilians in Gaza who have experienced immeasurable loss and will finally get the chance to rebuild their lives.\n\n'Now, with the backing of the United States and the world, the Middle East is on a path to peace that I hope endures and a future for Israelis and Palestinians alike with equal measures of peace, dignity, and safety.'\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris also acknowledged 'the President and his team' for making the agreement possible, but refused to refer to Trump by name.\n\nDespite the landmark deal, the peace in Gaza remained tenuous on Tuesday as Israel refused to increase aid to the area in retaliation for Hamas releasing just eight hostages' bodies.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ruled out doubling the number of trucks to deliver much-needed supplies to the Gaza Strip amid mounting anger at what he sees as the terror group's violation of the peace plan.\n\nAs well as maintaining deliveries at 300 lorries per day, Israel also refused to reopen the Rafah Crossing into Egypt as planned to let Palestinians come and go from the Strip.\n\nHamas was supposed to return all 28 dead alongside the 20 living hostages by midday on Monday. But while the world rejoiced that all those alive came home, just four bodies were delivered, with a further four last night.\n\nIt provoked fury across Israel with calls for the government to react severely to the violation of the deal, as burying your dead is a sacred ritual in the Jewish religion.\n\nNetanyahu set a deadline for progress by the end of yesterday, prompting Hamas to announce it would hand back another quartet. And last night the Israeli military said four more 'coffins of deceased hostages' were collected by the Red Cross in Gaza.\n\nSome are now accusing Hamas of intentionally withholding dead hostages - putting the fragile peace under immense strain.\n\nLocal broadcaster Kan, for example, reported that the Israeli government believes Hamas is holding some back intentionally amid fears they are trying to extort more out of Israel.\n\n Mediators and aid agencies, though, have insisted the terror group is simply having trouble locating the bodies given the level of destruction across the territory.\n\nChristian Cardon, spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross, even warned some remains may never be found.\n\nHe said: 'I think there is clearly a risk that that will take much more time. What we are telling the parties is that should be their top priority.'\n\nEgyptian teams are inside Gaza assisting efforts to locate and extract the bodies in consultation with Israel, according to Qatari Al Araby news outlet.\n\nGal Hirsch, Israel's pointman on hostages, insisted 'the mission is not complete' and told families he will 'intensify pressure' on Hamas until all the hostages have been returned.","summary":"NBC News' Andrea Mitchell was slammed online for appearing to credit the Biden administration for the ceasefire in Gaza brokered by President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15192813/Andrea-Mitchell-Biden-Blinken-Gaza-peace.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/15/04/102996473-0-image-m-25_1760497400216.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 04:02:24","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":369479566,"title":"Former Hostage Says Hamas Terrorists Afraid of Trump, Wanted Kamala Harris to Win","text":"On Tuesday’s “Alex Marlow Show,” host and Breitbart Editor-in-Chief Alex Marlow responded to one former Hamas hostage saying the terror group didn’t want Donald Trump to win in 2024.\n\nMarlow said, “So, this is the peace through strength approach.

It has been just over a month since Charlie Kirk was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University during his \"America Comeback Tour.\" Trump called his death \"a horrible, heinous, demonic act of murder,\" adding that \"he was assassinated in the prime of his life for boldly speaking the truth.\" According to CNN, Vice President JD Vance, Second Lady Usha Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and FBI Director Kash Patel were among those attending the ceremony. JD Vance, described as a close friend of Kirk, sat in the front row, while Erika Kirk expressed her gratitude to the vice president and his wife for accompanying her husband's remains back to Washington on Air Force Two. During his remarks, Trump credited Kirk for energising young voters and said his efforts were instrumental in securing electoral support from younger Americans. Jokingly, the president said that without Kirk's help, \"former Vice President Kamala Harris might have been in the White House rather than him.\" CNN reported that Trump used the moment to denounce what he described as violence from \"far-left radicals,\" calling their ideology \"the devil's ideology.\" He declared, \"Especially in the wake of Charlie's assassination, our country must have absolutely no tolerance for this radical left, violence, extremism and terror.\" However, CNN noted that available data does not support Trump's claims that political violence is primarily perpetrated by left-wing groups. Trump's speech also touched on other issues, including his administration's efforts to tackle crime and his criticism of what he called \"local mismanagement\" of wildfires in Los Angeles. The Presidential Medal of Freedom, presented to individuals for \"an especially meritorious contribution to the security or national interests of the United States,\" or to world peace and other significant endeavours, has been awarded to 24 recipients during Trump's first term, including Babe Ruth, Justice Antonin Scalia, and Elvis Presley. As CNN reported, Trump has announced his intention to present future awards to former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former HUD Secretary Ben Carson. Accepting the award, Erika Kirk reflected on her husband's \"fearlessness,\" faith, and commitment to freedom, describing his \"servant's heart.\" She said, \"If the moment had come, he probably would have run for president, but not out of ambition. He would only have done it if that was something that he believed that his country needed from a servant's heart standpoint.\" She recalled that her husband often prayed for his opponents, prompting Trump to smile. At Kirk's funeral, Trump had remarked that, unlike Kirk, \"I hate my opponent, and I don't want the best for them.\" Fighting back tears, Erika shared a moment with their young daughter, who had said she wanted to celebrate her father's birthday: \"She said, 'Happy birthday, Daddy. I want to give you a stuffed animal. I want you to eat a cupcake with ice cream, and I want you to go have a birthday surprise.'\" Closing her remarks, Erika Kirk said, \"To live free is the greatest gift, but to die free is the greatest victory. Happy birthday, my Charlie.

Her voice cracking and often falling to a whisper as she wiped away tears, Erika Kirk talked about her late husband’s life, political beliefs and legacy.\n\n“Thank you, Mr. President, for honoring my husband, in such a profound and meaningful way. And thank you for making this event a priority,” she said. “Your support of our family and the work that Charlie devoted his life to will be something I cherish forever.”\n\nThe ceremony coincided with what would have been Kirk’s 32nd birthday. It came about a month after the Turning Point USA founder was fatally shot while speaking to a crowd at Utah Valley University.\n\nIn a sign of Kirk’s close ties to the administration, he was the first recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom in Trump’s second term. The president also spoke at Kirk’s funeral in September, calling him a “great American hero” and “martyr” for freedom, while Vice President JD Vance accompanied his body home to Arizona on Air Force Two along with Erika Kirk.\n\n“We’re here to honor and remember a fearless warrior for liberty, beloved leader who galvanized the next generation like nobody I’ve ever seen before, and an American patriot of the deepest conviction, the finest quality and the highest caliber,” Trump said during the medal ceremony.\n\nOf Kirk’s killing, the president said, “He was assassinated in the prime of his life for boldly speaking the truth, for living his faith and relentless fighting for a better and stronger America.”\n\nThe Presidential Medal of Freedom was established by President John F. Kennedy in 1963 for individuals making exceptional contributions “to the security or national interests of the United States, world peace, cultural or other significant public or private endeavors.”\n\nTrump returned to the U.S. in the pre-dawn hours Tuesday after a whirlwind trip to Israel and Egypt to celebrate a ceasefire agreement in Israel’s war with Hamas in Gaza that his administration was instrumental in brokering. The president joked that he almost requested to reschedule the ceremony because of the trip.\n\n“I raced back halfway around the globe,” Trump said. “I was going to call Erika and say, ‘Erika, could you maybe move it to Friday?’ And I didn’t have the courage to call. But you know why I didn’t call? Because I heard today was Charlie’s birthday.”\n\nArgentine President Javier Milei, who had been visiting with the president at the White House earlier, stayed on to attend the ceremony.\n\nTrump has awarded a string of presidential medals going back to his first term, including to golf legend Tiger Woods, ex-football coach Lou Holtz and conservative economist Arthur Laffer as well as to Yankees Hall of Fame closer Mariano Rivera and conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, the latter of which came during the 2020 State of the Union. He awarded posthumous medals to Babe Ruth and Elvis Presley.\n\nThis term, Trump has also announced his intentions to award the medals to Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor and a close former adviser, and to Ben Carson, who served as Trump’s first-term secretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n\nKirk founded Turning Point USA in 2012 and Trump praised him as one of the key reasons he was reelected last year.\n\nBut Kirk’s politics were also often divisive. He sharply criticized gay and transgender rights while inflaming racial tensions. Kirk also repeated Trump’s false claims that former Vice President Kamala Harris was responsible for policies that encouraged immigrants to come to the U.S. illegally and called George Floyd, a Black man whose killing by a Minneapolis police officer sparked a national debate over racial injustice, a “scumbag.”\n\nAs Tuesday’s ceremony was underway, the Trump administration said it had revoked the visas of six foreigners who U.S. officials deemed had made derisive or mocking comments about Kirk’s assassination. The six who had their visas revoked were from Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Mexico, Paraguay and South Africa.\n\nThe move comes as the Trump administration and its supporters have zeroed in on people who made critical comments about Kirk, leading to firings and other discipline.\n\nTrump wrote in a social media post hours before it started that he was moving the ceremony from the White House’s East Room to the Rose Garden to accommodate a crowd he said would be “so big and enthusiastic.”\n\nTrump paved over the grass there and put in a patio area, and talked happily about the medal ceremony being one of the first major events in the new space. He noted how the weather had cleared up after it was expected to be raining, saying: “I was telling Erika, God was watching. And he didn’t want that for Charlie.”\n\nKirk’s widow said she asked their 3-year-old daughter what she might have given her father for his birthday, and she responded a stuffed animal and a cupcake while saying he hoped he’d get a birthday surprise. Erika Kirk said her husband was sometimes hard to buy presents for, but the medal was the perfect gift.\n\nErika Kirk said her husband might one day have run for president “but not out of ambition. He would only have done it if that was something that he believed that his country needed from his servant’s heart.”\n\nShe said God began a “mighty work” through her husband, and she intends to see it through.

I've talked to so many people who say, people who voted for Trump who say, 'Well, we thought he was just going to go after what he said were criminals, but he's going after hardworking people.’ And they feel lied to,\" Harris told Lemon. Harris spoke to Lemon while on tour in Chicago promoting her memoir, \"107 Days,\" which recounts her failed 2024 election campaign. The title refers to the abbreviated amount of time she had after then-President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her as the replacement nominee. \"And you know, there are a lot of people that feel lied to because he has lied to a lot of people,\" she said, arguing that Americans voted for Trump because he vowed to bring down prices before accusing the president of lying again. KAMALA HARRIS' BOOK, MEDIA TOUR SLAMMED BY LIBERAL CRITICS AS 'EMBARRASSING' AND 'UNHELPFUL' Harris told Lemon she thought Americans needed a break and declared they were ready to \"activate,\" before touting a \"No Kings\" protest. \"I think people are going to come out in big numbers, multi-generational, coming out to say that we know that we deserve better, and we want more of our government than the weaponization of the rule of law. We want more than the corruption, the callousness, and frankly, the incompetence we're seeing come out of the White House,\" she said. Lemon praised the former vice president and said he was proud of her while also lauding the book.

The announcement is triggered when Trump's announcement that he is running for president for a third time creates a potential conflict of interest with the Justice Department.\n\nSmith previously served as the chief prosecutor for the special court in The Hague charged with investigating war crimes in Kosovo.\n\nNov. 22, 2022\n\nSmith issues subpoenas to officials from multiple states that were targeted by Trump and his allies in the failed attempt to reverse his loss to Joe Biden.\n\nAccording to a copy of a subpoena obtained by ABC News, the Justice Department seeks any and all records related to communications by state election officials with Trump or his advisers and allies, including Kenneth Chesebro, Justin Clark, Joe DiGenova, John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Boris Epshteyn, Bernard Kerik, Bruce Marks, Cleta Mitchell, Matthew Morgan, Kurt Olsen, William Olsen, Stefan Passantino, Sidney Powell, Bill Stepien, Victoria Toensing, James Troupis and Lin Wood, between June 1, 2020, and Jan. 20, 2021.\n\nDec. 2, 2022\n\nFormer White House counsel Pat Cipollone and his deputy Pat Philbin testify before the federal grand jury investigating the events surrounding the Jan. 6, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News.\n\nTheir appearances come after a judge rules against attorneys for Trump who had argued that testimony by Trump's former top White House aides was protected by executive privilege.\n\nDec. 13, 2022\n\nABC News reports that Smith has issued subpoenas to election officials in Georgia and New Mexico, including the secretary of state's offices in both states and officials in Georgia's Cobb County, for communications with or involving Trump, his 2020 campaign aides, and a list of Trump allies involved in his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nJan. 11, 2023\n\nABC News reports that multiple associates of Trump have received new, wide-ranging subpoenas from Smith, requesting documents and records far more expansive than the previous outreaches these individuals received from the Department of Justice before Smith's appointment.\n\nFeb. 22, 2023\n\nABC News reports that Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner, both former senior White House advisers, have been subpoenaed by the special counsel.\n\nThe special counsel seeks information from the couple specifically related to his probe of Jan. 6 and the activities leading up to that day by the former president and his allies, sources tell ABC News.\n\nMarch 6, 2023\n\nTrump is seeking to prevent the special counsel from using Cipollone and Philbin's testimony before the federal grand jury as evidence in his ongoing probe, sources tell ABC News.\n\nApril 20, 2023\n\nTop Trump adviser Boris Epshteyn meets with special counsel prosecutors, sources tell ABC News.\n\nSources say that Smith personally sits in on a portion of Epshteyn's interview, but does not participate in any of the questioning.\n\nApril 27, 2023\n\nA day after a federal appeals panel rejects an effort from Trump to prevent former Vice President Mike Pence from testifying in the special counsel's probe, Pence appears before the grand jury, sources tell ABC News.\n\nApril 28, 2023\n\nA firm contracted by Trump's presidential campaign in November 2020 to investigate claims of voter fraud has been subpoenaed by the special counsel investigating those claims, the founder of the firm tells ABC News.\n\nKen Block, the founder of Simpatico Software Systems, says he was subpoenaed to turn over documents related to his work with the Trump campaign. His firm was the second one hired by the campaign that reported it found no widespread evidence of voter fraud.\n\nJune 6, 2023\n\nABC News reports that Trump's last White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has testified before the grand jury.\n\nSources say that Meadows answered questions on both Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election and Trump's alleged mishandling of classified documents while he was out of office.\n\nJune 8, 2023\n\nTrump is indicted on federal charges related to the special counsel's parallel probe into the former president's handling of classified information after leaving office.\n\nFive days later, Trump pleads not guilty to the 37-count indictment, which accuses him of repeatedly refusing to return hundreds of documents containing classified information ranging from U.S. nuclear secrets to the nation's defense capabilities.\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nABC News reports that agents from the United States Secret Service have testified before the grand jury probing efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nSources say that agents provided testimony as part of the grand jury's probe into whether there were any crimes committed during the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nJune 27, 2023\n\nABC News reports that Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger is expected to sit for an interview with special counsel investigators.\n\nRaffensperger, the top election official in Georgia, was the recipient of Trump's infamous phone call in January 2021, during which the then-president asked Raffensperger to \"find\" the exact number of votes he needed to win the state.\n\nJuly 13, 2023\n\nABC News reports that among those who have testified before the grand jury are Trump's son-in-law and former White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, and former top Trump aide Hope Hicks.\n\nJuly 16, 2023\n\nSmith informs Trump by letter that he is a target in his investigation into efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\nThe letter, which sources say was transmitted to Trump's attorneys, indicates that an indictment of the former president could be imminent.\n\nJuly 18, 2023\n\nABC News reports that special counsel prosecutors have contacted officials in Nevada, Wisconsin and Arizona as part of 2020 election probe.\n\nThose contacted include Republican Doug Ducey, the former Arizona governor who Trump had pressured to overturn Arizona's results following the 2020 election, according to sources.\n\nA Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesperson tells ABC News that the state's chief elections official met with federal investigators in April regarding the probe.\n\nJuly 20, 2023\n\nABC News reports that at least one more witness, Trump aide Will Russell, is expected to appear before the grand jury.\n\nJuly 27, 2023\n\nTrump attorneys John Lauro and Todd Blanche meet with Smith's team as a potential indictment of the former president looms, sources tell ABC News.\n\nThe lawyers are there to make the case for why they believe Trump shouldn't be indicted. Smith is present for the meeting, sources say.\n\nAug. 1, 2023\n\nTrump is indicted on charges of undertaking a \"criminal scheme\" to overturn the results of the 2020 election by allegedly enlisting a slate of so-called \"fake electors\" targeting several states; using the Justice Department to conduct \"sham election crime investigations\"; trying to enlist the vice president to \"alter the election results\"; and doubling down on false claims of a stolen election as the Jan. 6 riot ensued -- all in an effort to subvert democracy and stay in power.\n\nThe sweeping indictment, which also includes six alleged unnamed co-conspirators, charges Trump with four felony counts: conspiracy to defraud the United States, conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding, obstruction of and attempt to obstruct an official proceeding, and conspiracy against rights.\n\nTrump, speaking to ABC News, describes the new charges as a \"pile-on\" and says \"it's election interference\" meant to keep him from winning back the presidency.\n\nAug. 3, 2023\n\nTrump, appearing in a Washington, D.C., courtroom, pleads not guilty to all counts in the special counsel's Jan. 6 indictment. A hearing before Judge Tanya Chutkan, the judge assigned to preside over the trial, is scheduled for Aug. 28 -- five days after the first GOP primary debate.\n\n\"This is a very sad day for America,\" Trump says following his court appearance. \"This is a persecution of a political opponent.\"\n\nAug. 4, 2023\n\nSmith asks the court for a protective order to prevent \"the improper dissemination or use of discovery materials\" so prosecutors can begin providing discovery to Trump's legal team in the case.\n\nThe filing cites a social media post by Trump in which the former president says, \"IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I'M COMING AFTER YOU!\" -- a message the Trump campaign says is aimed at political interest groups.\n\nAug. 9, 2023\n\nABC News reports that a newly revealed memo from Dec. 6, 2020, details a plan by Trump attorney Kenneth Chesebro to pursue slates of supposedly \"alternate\" electors in order to prevent Biden from amassing 270 electoral votes.\n\nProsecutors say Chesebro was working with the Trump legal team to find ways to challenge the outcome of the election in order to keep Trump in office.\n\nAug. 10, 2023\n\nSmith says in a court filing that he's seeking a start date of Jan. 2 for Trump's trial. He estimates it will take no longer than four to six weeks to present his case to a jury in Washington, D.C., according to the filing.\n\nJudge Chutkan is expected to set an initial date for the trial when the parties meet for a status conference on Aug. 28.\n\nAug. 11, 2023\n\nJudge Chutkan issues a protective order against Trump following a hearing in which she cautions him against making \"inflammatory statements\" about the case and says that his First Amendment rights are \"not absolute.\"\n\nSmith had sought the protective order to prevent \"the improper dissemination or use of discovery materials\" his team was preparing to turn over to Trump's attorneys for them to prepare Trump's defense. The judge's ruling, issued following the hearing, prohibits the disclosure of a range of \"sensitive\" materials, including all recordings, transcripts, interview reports and related exhibits shared by the special counsel.\n\nAug. 17, 2023\n\nTrump's legal team requests that Judge Chutkan schedule the trial for his federal 2020 election interference case for April of 2026 -- more than two and a half years away.\n\nThe attorneys cite the large amount of discovery provided to them by the government -- roughly 11.5 million pages of evidence -- and say in their filing that if they began reviewing the documents today, \"we would need to proceed at a pace of 99,762 pages per day to finish the government's initial production by its proposed date for jury selection.\"\n\nAug. 28, 2023\n\nJudge Chutkan, at the end of a hearing on the matter, orders the start of Trump's trial on March 4, 2024 -- two months after prosecutors had requested but more than two years before Trump's proposed start date.\n\nThe judge closes the hearing by again cautioning parties that she is \"watching carefully\" for any actions taken that might impact the jury pool in Washington, D.C.\n\nSept. 11, 2023\n\nTrump files a motion seeking to have Judge Chutkan recused and disqualified from the case, citing past cases she oversaw for individuals charged in connection with the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, which they argue shows she \"suggested that President Trump should be prosecuted and imprisoned.\"\n\nSept. 15, 2023\n\nABC News reports that the special counsel has requested that Judge Chutkan impose a \"narrowly tailored\" order restricting Trump from making public statements that they argue could \"present a serious and substantial danger of prejudicing\" the case.\n\nSept. 26, 2023\n\nAttorneys for Trump, in a court filing, oppose the special counsel's request for a gag order, calling it an affront to Trump's First Amendment rights as he campaigns for president.\n\nSept. 28, 2023\n\nTrump's legal team asks the judge overseeing his case for a two-month extension for the filing of pretrial motions, beyond the current deadline of Oct. 9.\n\nOct. 5, 2023\n\nTrump files a motion to dismiss his case, citing what his lawyers claim is his \"absolute immunity\" from prosecution for actions taken while serving in the nation's highest office.\n\nOct. 10, 2023\n\nThe special counsel's team urges Judge Chutkan to implement protections for potential jurors, citing Trump's conduct on social media regarding people involved in his various legal battles.\n\nOct. 16, 2023\n\nJudge Chutkan grants part of the government's request for a narrowly tailored gag order against Trump, prohibiting him from making or \"reposting\" statements \"publicly targeting\" the special counsel and his staff, as well as Chutkan's staff and the staff of other D.C. district court personnel.\n\nThe ruling also bars him from making statements about potential witnesses in the case and the substance of their potential testimony.\n\nOct. 20, 2023\n\nJudge Chutkan temporarily halts the limited gag order she had placed on Trump, following Trump's appeal of her order.\n\nOct. 24, 2023\n\nABC News reports that former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows has spoken with special counsel Jack Smith's team at least three times this year, including once before a federal grand jury, which came only after Smith granted Meadows immunity to testify under oath, according to sources familiar with the matter.\n\nThe sources say Meadows informed Smith's team that he repeatedly told Trump in the weeks after the 2020 presidential election that the allegations of significant voting fraud coming to them were baseless, and that Trump was being \"dishonest\" with the public when he first claimed to have won the election only hours after polls closed on Nov. 3, 2020, before final results were in.\n\nOct. 26, 2023\n\nIn court filing, the special counsel's team accuses Trump of threatening Mark Meadows in a social media post after ABC News reported that sources said Meadows received immunity to speak with investigators. Smith's team tells Judge Chutkan in the filing that the alleged threat is just one more example of why a limited gag order in the case is needed.\n\nOct. 30, 2023\n\nJudge Chutkan, responding to Trump's social media comments regarding Mark Meadows, reinstates the limited gag order she imposed on Trump after temporarily halting it earlier in the month. Trump then lashes out at the judge, calling her a \"TRUE TRUMP HATER\" and criticizing her ability to preside over a fair trial.\n\nNov. 2, 2023\n\nTrump asks the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to issue an emergency stay of Judge Chutkan's limited gag order.\n\nThe special counsel, in the meantime, opposes a request from Trump's attorneys to delay all proceedings in the case pending a resolution of their motion to dismiss the case on immunity grounds.\n\nNov. 6, 2023\n\nIn a lengthy filing in response to Trump's motions to dismiss the case, the special counsel disputes Trump's argument that he can't be criminally charged in the case given that he was acquitted by the Senate following his impeachment after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\n\nNov. 20, 2023\n\nA Washington, D.C., appeals court, in a hearing, presses prosecutors with the special counsel's office and attorneys for Donald Trump over the viability of Judge Chutkan's currently-paused limited gag order.\n\nThe judges do not immediately issue a decision on whether the limited gag order should be reinstated.\n\nNov. 27, 2023\n\nABC News reports that former Vice President Mike Pence, speaking with the special counsel's team earlier this year, told investigators how, in the wake of the 2020 presidential election, then-President Donald Trump surrounded himself with \"crank\" attorneys, espoused \"un-American\" legal theories, and almost pushed the country toward a \"constitutional crisis,\" according to sources.\n\nThe sources said Pence -- who could take the stand against Trump should Smith's election interference case go to trial as planned in March -- also told investigators he's \"sure\" that, in the days before the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, he informed Trump that he still hadn't seen evidence of significant election fraud, but that Trump was unmoved, continuing to claim the election was stolen.\n\nDec. 5, 2023\n\nWriting that the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol was \"exactly what the defendant intended,\" the special counsel, in a court filing, details additional evidence he plans to introduce at trial, including evidence of Trump's alleged state of mind as his supporters carried out the attack.\n\nDec. 8, 2023\n\nThe D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals largely upholds Judge Chutkan's limited gag order in the special counsel's case against Trump, which prohibits him from making public statements about potential witnesses in the case as well as attorneys and court personnel.\n\nDec. 10, 2023\n\nThe special counsel's team asks the court to deny Trump's request to halt all proceedings in the case pending their appeal of Judge Chutkan's presidential immunity order, urging the judge to do all she can to make sure the March 4 trial date isn't delayed.\n\nDec. 11, 2023\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith's team asks the Supreme Court to step in and decide the issue of presidential immunity regarding Trump's federal election interference charges, and hours later the court says it will consider the request on an expedited basis.\n\nThe move could represent an enormous risk for Smith, whose entire case against Trump could hinge on a landmark decision from the Supreme Court that could -- for the first time in American history -- determine whether a former U.S. president can be prosecuted for actions taken while in office.\n\nDec. 13, 2023\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan agrees to Trump's request to stay proceedings in the case while the appeals process plays out. Special counsel Jack Smith's team had opposed an all-out stay, saying they felt certain filings could still move forward to keep the case on track for its March 4 trial date.\n\nDec. 20, 2023\n\nAttorneys for Trump ask the Supreme Court to stay out of the legal debate over presidential immunity and reject the special counsel's request for expedited consideration of the issue, urging the justices to allow a federal appeals court to consider the matter first.\n\nDec. 21, 2023\n\nIn a court filing, the special counsel reiterates his view that the Supreme Court must immediately review the question of Trump's immunity, writing that \"The charges here are of the utmost gravity.\"\n\nDec. 22, 2023\n\nThe Supreme Court denies the special counsel's request to immediately take up Trump's claims of immunity from prosecution in the case, allowing a federal appeals court to hear the matter first.\n\nThe decision effectively keeps the Supreme Court out of the case for the time being and could potentially delay the case's March 4 trial date.\n\nDec. 27, 2023\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, in a filing, asks Judge Chutkan to bar Trump from raising at trial what Smith describes as \"irrelevant\" claims that President Biden ordered Trump to be prosecuted and that others are to blame for the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\nJan. 4, 2024\n\nLawyers for Trump ask Judge Chutkan to hold special counsel Jack Smith and members of his team in contempt of court for what they claim are \"violations\" of the current stay of the case as the appeals process plays out. The attorneys argue that Smith's belief that only \"deadlines\" in the case are currently stayed -- and not the filing of papers -- is false.\n\nJan. 7, 2024\n\nABC News reports that the special counsel's team has uncovered previously undisclosed details about Trump's refusal to help stop the Jan. 6 attack as he sat watching TV inside the White House, according to sources familiar with what Smith's team has learned during its probe.\n\nJan. 9, 2024\n\nA three-judge panel in the Washington, D.C., Court of Appeals hears arguments on Trump's efforts to have his case dismissed based on his claim of presidential immunity. With Trump in attendance, his attorney D. John Sauer argues that a president can only be criminally prosecuted if they were to be impeached and convicted first.\n\nSpecial counsel attorney James Pearce counters that, \"If, I understood my friend on the other side to say here, a president orders a SEAL team to assassinate a political rival and resigned, for example before an impeachment, it's not a criminal act. I think that is extraordinarily frightening future.\"\n\nJan. 16, 2024\n\nThe full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals rejects an effort by Twitter to appeal a ruling that allowed special counsel Jack Smith to access records from Trump's Twitter account as part of his federal election interference probe.\n\nJan. 18, 2024\n\nJudge Chutkan rejects an effort by Trump to have the special counsel held in contempt for making additional filings in the case after she had issued a stay of the proceedings -- however, she orders that all parties in the case are forbidden from making any further substantive filings without first seeking permission from her.\n\nJan. 23, 2024\n\nThe full D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals denies Trump's request to take up his appeal of the limited gag order placed on him in the case. The ruling clears the way for Trump to seek to appeal the issue to the Supreme Court if desired.\n\nFeb. 2, 2024\n\nJudge Chutkan postpones the March 4 start date for Trump's federal election interference trial, saying she will set a new trial date after the Court of Appeals resolves the question of Trump's presidential immunity.\n\nFeb. 6, 2024\n\nWriting that \"We reject all three potential bases for immunity both as a categorical defense to federal criminal prosecutions of former Presidents and as applied to this case in particular,\" a three-judge panel in the U.S. Court of Appeals rejects Trump's claim of presidential immunity as it pertains to his federal election interference case.\n\nFeb. 12, 2024\n\nTrump files an emergency application with the U.S. Supreme Court asking the justices to stay the appeals court decision in order to allow the appellate process to play out.\n\nFeb. 13, 2024\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court, responding to Trump's request that it stay the appeals court decision that rejected his claim of absolute immunity in this Jan. 6 case, sets a deadline of Feb. 20 for special counsel Jack Smith to file his response to Trump's request.\n\nFeb. 14, 2024\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, in a filing, urges the Supreme Court to deny Trump's request to stay his Jan. 6 case from moving forward as Trump appeals his claim that he should be immune from prosecution. Smith asks that if the court does intend to hear Trump's appeal, that they grant the review now and go into an expedited briefing schedule that would have them issue their ruling during this term.\n\nFeb. 28, 2024\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court says it will take up the question of whether Trump can claim sweeping presidential immunity in his Jan. 6 case, with oral arguments scheduled for the week of April 22. The move further delays Trump's prosecution, which was already paused while he was pressing his immunity appeal in the lower courts.\n\nMarch 19, 2024\n\nTrump files a brief with the Supreme Court making his formal argument for why he should be granted absolute presidential immunity from criminal prosecution in his Jan. 6 case, for which the court will hear oral arguments on April 25.\n\nApril 8, 2024\n\nThe special counsel, in a filing, urges the Supreme Court to reject Trump's appeal that claims he should be immune from prosecution in the Jan. 6 case, arguing that the former president has put forward a \"novel and sweeping\" theory of immunity that lacks any historical precedent and refutes the vision of the country that the founders intended.\n\nApril 16, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court hears arguments on whether the federal government properly charged hundreds of alleged Jan. 6 rioters with felony obstruction.\n\nApril 25, 2024\n\nThe Supreme Court hears historic arguments on whether former President Trump can be criminally prosecuted related to his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, with Trump's attorneys arguing that a president should have \"absolute immunity\" for any \"official acts\" while in office.\n\nJune 28, 2024\n\nIn a ruling, the Supreme Court limits the scope of a federal obstruction statute used by prosecutors to charge former President Trump as well as more than 300 defendants involved with the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack, a decision the DOJ says will affect about 52 cases.\n\nJuly 1, 2024\n\nIn a blockbuster decision, the U.S. Supreme Court rules that former President Trump is entitled to some immunity from criminal prosecution for actions taken to overturn the results of the 2020 election, and sends the case back to the trial court to sort out which charges against him can stand -- effectively delaying any potential trial until after the November election.\n\nAug. 3, 2024\n\nU.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, resuming control over Trump's election interference case following the Supreme Court's immunity decision, denies Trump's earlier motion to dismiss the case based on selective and vindictive prosecution, and schedules the next hearing in the case for Aug. 16.\n\nAug. 8, 2024\n\nThe special counsel's office requests a delay in responding to a scheduling order from Judge Chutkan, citing issues related to the Supreme Court's immunity decision.\n\nAug. 9, 2024\n\nJudge Chutkan grants the special counsel's request for a delay in responding to a scheduling order, pushing back a status report and subsequent status conference by three weeks.\n\nAug. 27, 2024\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith charges Trump in a superseding indictment that charges him with the same election interference offenses in the original indictment, but is pared down and adjusted to the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling.\n\nAug. 30, 2024\n\nIn a joint filing, special counsel Jack Smith asks Judge Chutkan to proceed with the case by addressing the Supreme Court's immunity decision, while attorneys for Trump ask her to immediately consider dismissing the case based on the legality of Smith's appointment.\n\nSept. 3, 2024\n\nTrump, in a court filing, waives his right to be present at his arraignment on the superseding election interference charges and authorizes his attorney to enter a plea of not guilty on his behalf.\n\nSept. 5, 2024\n\nAt a hearing in front of Judge Chutkan, Trump's lawyers enter a plea of not guilty to all charges in the superseding indictment against the former president. Chutkan, over the objection of defense lawyers, rules that special counsel Jack Smith can file a comprehensive brief containing grand jury testimony and evidence supporting his presidential immunity arguments by Sept. 26.\n\nSept. 24, 2024\n\nJudge Chutkan grants special counsel Jack Smith's request to file an oversized 180-page brief, exceeding the standard 45-page limit, when Smith submits his brief on how the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling applies to Trump's case.\n\nSept. 26, 2024\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith files his lengthy court brief arguing how his case against Trump conforms to the Supreme Court's ruling on presidential immunity. The brief is filed under seal, leaving Judge Chutkan to determine if any of it will be made public.\n\nSept. 27, 2024\n\nA day after filing a sealed brief seeking to justify his superseding indictment against Trump, special counsel Jack Smith, in a court filing, asks Judge Chutkan to allow him to file a public version of the brief that includes \"substantive\" summaries of what investigators learned from witnesses in the case.\n\nOct. 2, 2024\n\nIn a blockbuster court filing unsealed by Judge Chutkan, special counsel Jack Smith outlines new details of Trump and his allies' \"increasingly desperate\" efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss, as Smith seeks to defend his prosecution of Trump following the Supreme Court's July immunity ruling.\n\nOct. 3, 2024\n\nJudge Chutkan, granting a request from Trump's attorneys to push back the Oct. 17 deadline for their reply to the special counsel's new court filing defending his case, gives them until Nov. 7 to file their reply, and gives the special counsel until Nov. 21 to file his subsequent response.\n\nOct. 16, 2024\n\nSpecial counsel Jack Smith, in a court filing, urges Judge Chutkan to reject an effort by Trump's attorneys to throw out Jan. 6 obstruction-related charges brought against the former president following a recent Supreme Court ruling that narrowed the statute's use against Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nOct. 17, 2024\n\nJudge Chutkan denies a last-minute request from Trump's attorneys to block the release of the redacted appendix from the immunity motion filed by special counsel Jack Smith, which lists evidence gathered in the probe.\n\nOct. 18, 2024\n\nJudge Chutkan unseals the highly redacted appendix of evidence gathered by special counsel Jack Smith, offering a limited look at the evidence that could be seen by a jury should Trump's case goes to trial.\n\nNov. 5, 2024\n\nVoters heads to the polls to decide if Donald Trump will be reelected president over Kamala Harris -- an outcome that would likely end the election interference case against Trump due to a long-standing Justice Department policy that bars the prosecution of a sitting president.\n\nNov. 6, 2024\n\nTrump is reelected president of the United States, prompting special counsel Jack Smith to begin evaluating how to end his prosecution of Trump in both the election interference case and the classified documents case, sources tell ABC News.\n\nNov. 8, 2024\n\nJudge Chutkan pauses all upcoming deadlines in the election interference case, after special counsel Jack Smith says the government needs time to \"assess this unprecedented circumstance and determine the appropriate course going forward consistent with Department of Justice policy,\" which he says they will do by Dec. 2.\n\nNov. 25, 2024\n\nHours after special counsel Jack Smith asks her to toss Trump's election interference case due to the Justice Department's long-standing policy barring the prosecution of a sitting president, Judge Chutkan dismisses the case without prejudice -- closing the book on the case but leaving open the highly unlikely possibility of a future prosecution once Trump leaves office.\n\nJan. 7, 2025\n\nAs special counsel Jack Smith makes preparations to deliver the requisite final report on his election interference probe and classified documents investigation, the federal judge who dismissed Trump's classified documents case, Aileen Cannon, temporarily blocks the release of Smith's report at Trump's request, while the matter is considered by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nJan. 8, 2024\n\nThe U.S. attorney general's office asks the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals to vacate Judge Cannon's order blocking the release of special counsel Jack Smith's final report, and, in the meantime, to \"make clear that there is no impediment to the Attorney General allowing for ... the public release of Volume One\" of the report, which covers Smith's election interference probe.\n\nJan. 9, 2024\n\nThe Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denies the effort to block the release of special counsel Jack Smith's final report -- but declines to immediately overturn Judge Cannon's temporary injunction, instead ruling that the Justice Department can file a separate appeal if they want to release the report earlier than Sunday, when Cannon's injunction expires.\n\nJan. 10, 2024\n\nAttorneys for Trump's former co-defendants in his classified documents case, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, ask Judge Cannon to extend her three-day restraining order prohibiting the release of special counsel Jack Smith's final report so she can hold a hearing about Garland's proposed plan to release the portion of the report covering Smith's classified documents investigation to select members of Congress, and publicly release the portion of the report covering the election interference probe.\n\nJan. 11, 2024\n\nIn a court filing to Judge Cannon, the Justice Department argues that she has no further jurisdiction to continue to weigh in on the release of the Jan. 6. volume of special counsel Jack Smith's final report following the DOJ's successful appeal with the Eleventh Circuit. Cannon then asks the DOJ whether anything in the Jan. 6 volume has any bearing on the classified documents case as it pertains to former Trump co-defendants Nauta and De Oliveira.\n\nOn the same day, a separate DOJ court filing says that Jack Smith has formally resigned as special counsel after submitting his final report on his probes to Garland. His resignation was widely expected following Trump's reelection in November, which saw both his cases against the president-elect dismissed due to a longstanding Department of Justice policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president.\n\nJan. 12, 2024\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland, who is seeking to release the Jan. 6 volume of Jack Smith's final report to the public, tells Judge Cannon in a Justice Department court filing that the DOJ does not believe anything in the Jan. 6 volume has any bearing on the evidence or charges related to former Trump co-defendants Nauta and De Oliveira as laid out in the classified documents volume.\n\nJan. 13, 2024\n\nJudge Cannon clears the way for the Justice Department, when her injunction expires at midnight, to publicly release the volume of special counsel Jack Smith's report covering his election interference case against Trump, on the grounds that its contents have no bearing on the classified documents case against former Trump co-defendants Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira. As midnight approaches, Cannon then denies Trump's eleventh-hour effort to delay the release of the report.\n\nJan. 14, 2025\n\nThe Justice Department, shortly after midnight, releases the volume of special counsel Jack Smith's final report on his election interference case. Smith, in the report, lays out his case against Trump -- including the intimidation tactics he says Trump brought to bear -- and says his team amassed enough evidence to convict the former president on multiple felonies for his alleged efforts to unlawfully overturn the results of the 2020 election, had voters not decided to send him back to the White House in the 2024.\n\nJan. 20, 2025\n\nDonald Trump is sworn in as the nation's 47th president and vows to end what he calls the \"weaponization of the government\" by directing the incoming attorney general to review law enforcement activity and actions taken by the intelligence community over the course of Joe Biden's presidency. Later in the day he follows through on his pledge to pardon those charged with participating in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, granting a sweeping unconditional pardon to more than 1,500 rioters and commutations for more than a dozen others.\n\nJan. 31, 2025\n\nSources tell ABC News that the Justice Department, now under the direction of former Trump attorney Emil Bove, has asked for information about FBI agents and other bureau employees who were involved in the investigations stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack.\n\nFeb. 4, 2025\n\nA group of FBI agents who assisted in criminal investigations stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack files suit in an effort to block the Justice Department from assembling lists of agents for potential disciplinary actions or firings.\n\nFeb. 5, 2025\n\nFormer Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, just hours after being sworn in as U.S. attorney general, issues a directive establishing a \"Weaponization Working Group\" that she says will be tasked with reviewing \"politicized\" actions of officials who investigated Trump at both the state and federal levels.\n\nFeb. 7, 2025\n\nThe Justice Department and attorneys representing a group of FBI employees reach a temporary deal to ensure a list compiled by the DOJ of FBI personnel who worked on cases stemming from the Jan. 6 Capitol attack won't be released publicly pending further legal proceedings.\n\nFeb. 25, 2025\n\nTrump signs an executive action stripping former special counsel Jack Smith's personal attorney of his government security clearance.\n\nAug. 2, 2025\n\nThe U.S. Office of Special Counsel confirms it has opened an investigation into whether former special counsel Jack Smith's criminal prosecutions of Donald Trump were an attempt to impact Trump's 2024 presidential campaign in violation of the Hatch Act.\n\nAug. 26, 2025\n\nAttorneys representing former special counsel Jack Smith hit back at reports of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel's investigation of Smith, describing the reasoning for the probe as \"imaginary and unfounded.\"\n\nOct. 14, 2025\n\nRepublican House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan, in a letter, asks former special counsel Jack Smith to testify before the panel and provide documents and communications related to his probes, so the committee can \"understand the full extent to which the Biden-Harris Justice Department weaponized federal law enforcement.\"\n\nABC News' Soo Rin Kim, Laura Romero, Lucien Bruggeman, Olivia Rubin, Will Steakin and Aaron Katersky contributed to this report.","summary":"Here's a look at how special counsel Jack Smith's investigation into former President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election results has unfolded.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-special-counsels-probe-trumps-efforts-overturn-2020/story?id=101537003","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/57e9b209-9471-4db2-9e2c-b7d117f504be/trump-jan6-speech-file-gty-jef-230720_1689890937590_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-15 00:45:00","author":"Alexander Mallin,Katherine Faulders,Luke Barr,Peter Charalambous","authors":["Alexander Mallin","Katherine Faulders","Luke Barr","Peter Charalambous"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.073}]}
