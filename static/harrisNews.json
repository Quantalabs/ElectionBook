In a Friday post on X, Gabbard said she revoked the clearance per a Trump directive. \"Per @POTUS directive, I have revoked former President Joe Biden’s security clearance, and revoked clearances and access to classified information for Kamala Harris, Hillary Clinton, Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, Fiona Hill, and Alexander Vindman,\" she wrote. TRUMP REVOKES SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION FOR ADULT BIDEN CHILDREN HUNTER AND ASHLEY Cheney has been a staunch Trump critic following the events of Jan. 6, 2021, when many of the president's supporters rioted in the U.S. Capitol. Hill testified during the November 2019 House impeachment hearings against Trump, while Kinzinger, a Republican, became known for his vocal opposition to Trump while serving in the House. Vindman, an Army veteran, garnered national attention in October 2019 when he testified before Congress regarding the Trump–Ukraine scandal. His testimony was used to charge Trump with abuse of power in his first impeachment. TRUMP STRIPS SECURITY CLEARANCES FROM LAW FIRM TIED TO JACK SMITH CASES Last week, the White House released a memo that read: \"I have determined that it is no longer in the national interest for the following individuals to access classified information: Antony Blinken, Jacob Sullivan, Lisa Monaco, Mark Zaid, Norman Eisen, Letitia James, Alvin Bragg, Andrew Weissmann, Hillary Clinton, Elizabeth Cheney, Kamala Harris, Adam Kinzinger, Fiona Hill, Alexander Vindman, Joseph R. Biden Jr., and any other member of Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s family.\" Earlier this month, Gabbard announced that she had revoked the security clearances of several people listed in Trump's memo and blocked them from having access to classified information. She said \"the 51 signers of the Hunter Biden ‘disinformation’ letter\" also had their clearances rescinded.

How are we the public to trust you or CBS to report on Bezos’ gutting WaPo knowing he gave you a ride to space?”\n\n“Your very own Gayle King is supporting a man shutting down free speech and a free press,” said another person, while another yet another pointed out: “You know what he stands for. That you are willingly participating is mind boggling and deeply disappointing.”\n\nCritics say that Bezos is not some neutral, nonpartisan business leader offering cool rides into space. The billionaire owner of Amazon, the Washington Post and Blue Origin has very much inserted himself into the current political discourse and become a polarizing national public figure. He also needs to promote his Blue Origin space technology business.\n\nBezos first tried to influence public opinion by killing the Post’s ready-to-publish endorsement of Kamala Harris before the Nov. 5 election. Since then, he has initiated a rightward tilt of the newspaper’s once vaunted opinion section, in what departing Post columnist Ruth Marcus said is a bid “to cozy up to” and appease the new president by suppressing writers’ viewpoints.\n\nCritics also note that Bezos has been labeled by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, D-Vermont, and many others on the left as one of America’s new ruling class of oligarchs. In a speech on the Senate floor, Sanders talked about how Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and tech moguls view themselves as “modern-day kings” who have embraced Trump’s election and even his move toward “authoritarianism” because it benefits their ability to make more money and wield cultural influence. Sanders and others also excoriated Bezos and Sanchez’s participation in Trump’s inauguration, creating what Marcus called “a spectacle” of tycoons “arrayed like so many trophies behind the triumphant new president.”\n\nAmid all these concerns about Bezos, the “oligarchy” and his “gutting” of the Post, King has appeared in multiple segments on “CBS Mornings” to promote Bezos’s Blue Origin, most recently on Thursday, when she laughed and chit-chatted with 94-year-old “Star Trek” actor William Shatner about his 2021 ride on a Bezos rocket, People reported. \n\nKing also has posted multiple social media messages, including Friday, to promote her flight into space, which is scheduled to take place April 14. She’ll be riding with Sanchez, as well as with Sanchez’s good friend, singer Katy Perry, former NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe and several other women.\n\nIt’s not known whether Bezos is hosting King’s ride, with NBC reporting that tickets for the 11-minute Blue Origin journeys typically cost in the six figures. If CBS paid for King’s ticket, one still has to wonder about the news value of an event that is being criticized as a publicity stunt for a controversial public figure.\n\nIf Bezos is hosting King, former CNN media analyst Oliver Darcy wrote on his Status Substack that this “freebie” ride would appear to be “a conflict of interest.” Darcy noted that CBS News has strict policies against anchors accepting “bribes, gifts and freebies,” so as to avoid a potential or perceived conflict of interest.\n\nThe Society of Professional Journalists Code of Ethics also says that journalists should strive to act independently by “avoiding conflicts of interest, real or perceived,” and by refusing “gifts, favors, fees, free travel and special treatment.” They also should avoid “political and other outside activities that may compromise integrity or impartiality or may damage credibility.”\n\nDarcy asked who at CBS News gave a green light to King’s trip. Representatives at CBS News and CBS Mornings did not respond to an email request from this news organization seeking comment on King’s space voyage or the decision-making behind it.\n\nBut viewers of “CBS Mornings” and self-described King fans had plenty to say on Instagram in late February. They accused King of showing self-interest, lack of concern about press freedom and seeming complicity in Bezos and Sanchez’s efforts to garner positive publicity.\n\n“I always stuck with ‘CBS Mornings’ but ‘GMA’ here I come,” a now-former King fan said. “That you and the other participants can help this Trump supporter billionaire fulfill his dreams while he’s destroying the dreams of the working class is outrageous!”\n\n“This is beyond disappointing,” another person said. “As a journalist, you would think Gayle would be concerned with the decisions Bezos has made with the Washington Post.”\n\nThis commenter also said that King is in a position to make a difference and stand on principle but instead is “showing what matters most and it has nothing to do with those of us that have been supportive of her throughout her career. Another one bites the dust…bye Felicia.”\n\n“How tone-deaf are you?” asked another person. “Thanks for empowering billionaires and MAGA bull —- yet again. And no matter how you spin it, shame on you.”\n\nSomeone else said they were disappointed but not surprised by King’s actions: “This is who Gayle King is Just another celebrity journalist that can be bought. Nothing new to see here.”","summary":"King's journalistic ethics are under fire over her participation in a 'PR stunt' on behalf of Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, in the wake of his 'gutting' of the Washington Post and their friendliness with Trump.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/03/28/cbs-gayle-king-slammed-oligarch-jeff-bezos-rocket/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GayleKing1.jpeg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 22:41:56","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.184},{"id":305325040,"title":"Here’s How You Can Participate in Elon Musk’s $2 Million Giveaway","text":"The world’s richest man, and Donald Trump’s best friend, Elon Musk is offering millions of dollars to Wisconsin residents who champion his latest political cause. \n\n‘On Sunday night, I will give a talk in Wisconsin,’ Musk posted on his X app Friday.\n\n‘Entrance is limited to those who have signed the petition in opposition to activist judges,’ he noted, mentioning a petition from his political action committee, America PAC.\n\nThe ‘Petition in Opposition to Activist Judges’ advocates for judges to ‘interpret laws as written, not rewrite them to fit their personal or political agendas.’\n\n‘By signing below, I’m rejecting the actions of activist judges who impose their own views and demanding a judiciary that respects its role—interpreting, not legislating,’ the Musk-funded effort states. \n\nMusk’s bid to garner support for his PAC’s petition comes as a race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court heats up. The election, which will be held Tuesday, will sway the makeup of the court, which will soon be responsible for redistricting the states. \n\nWhatever party wins the state’s supreme court race will almost certainly get a more favorable congressional map in the midterms, so Musk is dishing out millions to Wisconsinites in hopes to keep the state red. \n\n‘I will also hand over checks for a million dollars to 2 people to be spokesmen for the petition,’ the Tesla CEO wrote. \n\nEarlier in the day, just after midnight on Friday, the X owner published a similar post saying the weekend event will be ‘limited to those who have voted in the Supreme Court election.’\n\nHowever, his late night post quickly garnered backlash as Democrats and legal analysts slammed the bid as buying votes. \n\nThe Wisconsin Democratic party Chair Ben Wikler released a statement calling Musk’s original post ‘a blatant felony by offering money for votes.’ \n\n‘Elon Musk should be brought to justice of his illegal attempt to buy votes,’ Wikler’s statement continued. \n\nMusk has already spent over $20 million to support Republican Supreme Court candidate Brad Schimel, the Wisconsin Democratic party claimed. A liberal judge on the bench is retiring. \n\n‘Musk: The Democrats are stealing the election! Also Musk: I’ll pay you a million bucks to vote for my candidate! The hypocrisy is wild,’ Mike Nellis, a Democratic strategist and former Kamala Harris advisor wrote on X. \n\nEven with Musk’s change of phrasing the billionaire’s offer for millions may still be illegal, some legal minds argue. \n\n‘Conditioning entry to this event and eligibility for the $1 million payout on whether someone has voted may violate Wisconsin law,’ Brendan Fischer, a campaign finance lawyer wrote of the giveaway on X.\n\n‘The law prohibits offering or giving anything of value to induce a person to vote,’ he continued. ‘Extending this offer now might unlawfully induce Wisconsinites who have not already voted to cast a ballot.’\n\nBut the Tesla CEO has already announced a winner in Wisconsin. \n\nEarlier this week, Musk announced a Green Bay man won $1 million for participating in America PAC’s efforts, though it was not clear who determined the winner. \n\nMusk’s multi-million dollar giveaway will not be his first. \n\nBefore the 2024 election, America PAC giveaway checks to individuals who signed a petition in support of the First Amendment. \n\nSince launching his PAC in spring 2024, Musk has poured hundreds of millions of his own cash into the group. \n\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court race is the most expensive judicial race in history, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. \n\nOver $81 million has been spent so far, the previous record was $51 million, which was the amount spent in the last Wisconsin Supreme Court election two years ago.","summary":"The world&#8217;s richest man, and Donald Trump&#8217;s best friend, Elon Musk is&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/heres-how-you-can-participate-in-elon-musks-2-million-giveaway/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 22:33:33","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.238},{"id":305324116,"title":"FCC Will Investigate Disney And ABC Over DEI Practices","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nThe chair of the Federal Communications Commission said on social media Friday he asked the enforcement bureau of the FCC to open an investigation into Disney and ABC over concerns that the company may have been “violating FCC equal employment opportunity” with its diversity equity and inclusion programs.\n\nFILE - Alan Bergman, co-chairman of Disney Entertainment, addresses the audience during the Walt ...

For decades, Disney focused on churning out box office and programming successes,” Carr wrote to Iger. “But then something changed. Disney now has been embroiled in rounds of controversy surrounding its DEI policies.”\n\nHas Trump Targeted Disney In The Past?\n\nTrump sued ABC News, which is owned by Disney, and George Stephanopoulos last year, arguing the network broadcast statements from Stephanopoulos that were “false, intentional, malicious and designed to cause harm.” In the suit, Trump took issue with Stephanopoulos saying Trump was found “liable for rape” at least 10 times, when he was actually found liable for sexual assault. In December, Disney settled the suit and agreed to pay $15 million as a contribution to a “presidential foundation and museum” to be established by or for Trump in the future, along with $1 million for Trump’s attorneys’ fees. The settlement led to accusations that Disney had caved to Trump and that it could “embolden” Trump to file similar suits, The New York Times reported.\n\nWhat Is The Fcc?\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission is a government agency designed to be an independent regulator of “interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable.” It currently has three commissioners, two Democrats and one Republican though one of the Democratic commissioners just announced his resignation. Carr—a Trump appointee who previously served as a commissioner—is the chair.While the agency is supposed to be independent, it recently broke precedent by calling for an investigation into CBS’s “60 Minutes” for its interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, the same story Trump himself filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS over. When talking about the complaint, Carr said Trump was “ahead of the curve” and “has been right on these media bias issues,” Variety reported.\n\nHas Carr Launched Similar Investigations?\n\nYes. In February, Carr ordered a similar investigation into DEI programs at Comcast, the parent company of NBC and Universal Studios. Though not DEI based, Carr also launched investigations into NPR and PBS for corporate sponsorships of programming.\n\nKey Background\n\nAlmost immediately after taking office for his second term, Trump zeroed in on ending all DEI initiatives in both the public and private sectors. DEI policies rose in the U.S. in 2020 after the killing of George Floyd, but have come under fire in recent years from Republicans for being “woke.” On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that called for the elimination of all DEI programs in the federal government and the end of agencies considering diversity in hiring, and it threatened to punish some private entities that use them. The order said the government had been infiltrated with DEI programs and referenced an executive order from former President Joe Biden that called on federal agencies to address racial inequities. To respond to Trump’s calls to banish DEI from hiring practices and workplaces, dozens of companies and organizations—including Paramount, Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and more—have been reframing or removing their policies in recent months. Most recently, the Major League Baseball association told the Associated Press it removed references to diversity from its website to comply with federal law, though it said the organization’s “values on diversity remain unchanged.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDisney Shifts Away From DEI To Return To Its Entertainment Business Mission (Forbes)\n\nMLB Removes References To Diversity From Careers Website: Here Are All The Companies Rolling Back DEI Programs (Forbes)\n\nABC News Pays $15 Million To Settle Donald Trump’s Defamation Suit (Forbes)\n\nFollow me on Twitter.

She was welcomed warmly, and attendees quickly leaked to the media that she \"looked great, very relaxed, almost like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\" Her party appearance was meant to be a prelude to her scheduled appearance at the Oscars, which would have been her most significant TV exposure since leaving Washington on January 20. After four years as vice president and an unprecedented 100-day presidential campaign that cost over a billion dollars and ended in a crushing defeat, Harris was set for a high-profile comeback. However, security concerns at the event led to the cancellation of her appearance. Instead, her husband, Doug Emhoff, posted a photo of her in a sweatshirt, preparing a bowl of Doritos to watch the ceremony from home. The Oscar weekend wasn’t a total loss. At the pre-Oscar party, Harris hinted at her next move, telling several people she would \"make a decision by the end of summer.\" What exactly that decision is remains unclear — even to her. \"She’s very slow to make decisions, sometimes excessively so,\" said a senior Democratic official. \"But if she wants to stay in politics, she’ll need to decide quickly because there’s a huge vacuum.\" On January 6, in her role as vice president, Harris officially certified Donald Trump’s victory in the presidential election. No mobs stormed the Capitol, no gallows were erected outside and no congressional offices were ransacked. Harris confirmed her defeat with the same composure she’s known for, never revealing what was happening beneath the surface. \"For president? I’m afraid she won’t be able to get there,\" said one Democratic strategist. \"But she got 75 million votes in a short, high-pressure campaign and earned a lot of goodwill by breathing life into Joe Biden’s dead race. We live in unprecedented times, so who knows?\" Afterward, she traveled to Hawaii to unwind with family and friends before returning to Washington for Trump’s inauguration. In the same Capitol where she certified Trump’s victory, she watched the new president deliver a speech devoid of magnanimity and filled with threats — threats he has since acted on. Between the time Harris and Emhoff left the vice president’s residence for the last time and the end of the inauguration, government workers efficiently scrubbed all traces of the previous tenants. Harris, sources said, left without sentimentality. She had always planned to leave that day, just under different circumstances — moving four kilometers (2.5 miles) from the Naval Observatory to the White House. Instead, she found herself living out the real-life version of the famous meme of John Travolta looking lost in an empty room. \"There was no Plan B,\" said a Democratic activist. \"Her campaign team genuinely believed she was winning — a close victory, but a victory.\" Can Harris bounce back from a defeat like that? \"For president? I doubt it. But she got 75 million votes in a tough race and built goodwill by energizing Biden’s campaign. She may think she has one more run left in her. One thing is clear: when Harris said she wouldn’t go quietly into the night, she meant it.\" Immediately after Trump’s inauguration, as he signed executive orders undoing much of the administration Harris was part of, she boarded her final taxpayer-funded flight. Nearly six hours from Washington to Los Angeles is a long time to sit with your thoughts. If Harris broke down after the November loss, only her husband saw it. Two months later, on that flight back to California, there was an odd sense of relief. \"I’m staying in the fight,\" she assured her disheartened allies. \"No one in American political history can truly understand what Harris went through,\" Democratic pollster Paul Maslin told Politico. \"And I don’t envy her. She deserves time to process it.\" Donna Brazile, a close ally who ran Al Gore’s campaign — the last vice president to run for president and lose — agreed. \"She needs time to process what happened because it’s deeply personal. Despite the loss, she gained significant political capital. You don’t waste that by making rash decisions.\" Harris and Emhoff returned to their $4.8 million home in Brentwood, Los Angeles. It will remain their primary residence but sources say they’re looking for a second home in New York. While many neighbors were happy to see them, not everyone welcomed them back. \"I’m ashamed she lives in my neighborhood,\" a Trump voter told the New York Post. \"She should be in the White House, not here,\" said a Harris supporter. Of the two, Emhoff seemed more relieved to be back in L.A. The first-ever \"Second Gentleman\" had struggled with being a political spouse. He spoke candidly about his search for purpose in Washington, which he found in fighting antisemitism and teaching at Georgetown Law. Shortly after returning home, he resumed his entertainment law career, a job he reluctantly left when Harris became Biden’s running mate. In the early months of Trump’s presidency, Harris was rarely seen in public, except for occasional grocery runs with Emhoff. In late February, she made her first televised appearance since leaving the White House, accepting an honorary award from the NAACP. The audience gave her a long ovation, with some in tears. \"This organization was born when our nation struggled against greed, bitterness and hate,\" Harris told Black community leaders. \"Now, we again feel the weight of history. People see flames on the horizon, shadows gathering over our democracy, and ask, ‘What do we do now?’ But we know exactly what to do — because we’ve done it before and we’ll do it again.\" That speech marked the beginning of her reemergence. Even before the NAACP event, she had attended two Broadway shows in one weekend, receiving applause similar to what Hillary Clinton experienced after losing to Trump in 2016. Broadway remains a safe haven for liberal politicians. For the first time in decades, Harris holds no public office, meaning she must build her own infrastructure for a comeback. To that end, she launched a company called Pioneer 49 to support her post-vice presidency career and potentially fuel her next political move. Pioneer was her Secret Service codename, and 49 reflects her status as the 49th vice president. She also signed with the top talent agency CAA for representation across various fields. Now, she just needs to decide what’s next. Harris has three main options: run for California governor in 2026, launch another presidential bid in 2028, or stay on the sidelines while leading the Democratic Party from the outside, making money in the private sector and writing cookbooks. The third option seems unlikely. \"She won’t stay quiet for long,\" said a former campaign aide. \"People will want to hear from her and she’ll be ready.\" Not by chance did Harris say she'd decide by summer what her next step would be. Summer is the time to enter the race for California governor, a race she's expected to win easily. “Can she run for governor? Yes,” Brian Brokaw, a former aide to Harris who remains close to her, told Politico. “Do I think she wants to run for governor? Probably not. Can she win? Absolutely. Does she want the job? I don’t know. Can she run for president again? Yes.” In conversations with associates, Harris has acknowledged how difficult it would be for her to win the presidential primaries in 2028 and has recalled that even as a young prosecutor, she expressed interest in becoming California’s governor. Now, she might find the idea especially tempting — leading the largest and most influential state in the U.S., she'd find herself clashing with Trump on nearly every issue. “Harris is disgusted by him,” said a Democratic activist. “Beyond the fact that he's a racist, she thinks — rightfully so — that his presence in the White House is a disgrace to the U.S. I wouldn’t rule out the possibility that she won’t be able to resist the temptation to battle him every day.” If this does happen, Harris will break another glass ceiling, becoming the first woman to serve as governor of California. As governor, she'd have plenty of opportunities to confront Trump. The main implication of entering the California race is that Harris would be giving up her presidential ambitions, at least for 2028. It’s impossible to both govern the world’s fifth-largest economy and run for president. The decision is harder than it seems. Those close to Harris believe that despite her election loss, she emerged from the experience stronger and won’t carry the toxic label that stuck to Hillary Clinton after her 2016 defeat. Just how toxic is that label? The only time Harris’s campaign used Clinton during the election was at a fundraiser in Florida — a state that wasn’t even competitive. Preliminary and largely irrelevant polls conducted in recent months have shown Harris with a significant lead over a long list of potential Democratic candidates, but there’s no reason to take them seriously just yet. “I don’t think she can win a presidential primary,” the Democratic activist said. “The party is so scared and weak right now that there's a better chance of the late Jimmy Carter becoming the nominee in 2028 than a Black woman. It’s unfair and depressing because no one in modern history has inherited a presidential candidacy just 100 days before an election and I don’t think any other candidate would have done better — but that’s where we are now. If she wants to stay in politics, the California governorship makes much more sense.” One thing Harris will definitely do is write a book, which has already generated enormous interest — even before she’s typed a single word. “Kamala is about to land the biggest book deal of any vice president in history,” Keith Urbahn, president and co-founder of the top literary agency Javelin, told NBC. “But the real question isn’t how much she’ll get upfront, but whether the book can redefine her ahead of the 2028 election. There’s one version of the book that’s full of clichés and plays it safe and there’s another that reinvents Harris to lead a party in need of rebuilding. She’ll get the same money either way but only the second version gives her another shot at the White House.” Biden may have publicly said that Harris had to do whatever it took to defeat Trump, but in private, he told her to ensure that “not even daylight could come between them” — in other words, not to distance herself from him. The desire among Harris’s supporters for her book to “burn it all down” also stems from post-election revelations about how Biden boxed her in. Harris is 60, still young enough, and Democrats are placing most of the blame for her loss on Biden, who entered the 2020 race as the party’s beloved savior and left office in January as a tragic figure. “It’s all on him,” the Democratic activist said angrily. “We could analyze Harris’s campaign mistakes until next year but she was thrown into an impossible situation created by Biden’s enormous ego. He should never have run again in the first place. We’re here because of Joe Biden and the small, insular circle around him. In fact, they’re even more to blame — they knew he shouldn’t run.” The question of how candid Harris can be in her upcoming book is tied to her decision about staying in politics and in what role. But her associates believe that at the very least, she must use the book to do what she didn’t in her campaign — sever all ties to Biden. “That was the biggest mistake of her life,” said the Democratic activist. “Every time I think about the chances she had to break away from him and present a completely new vision and she chose not to — my veins start popping.” Biden, it turns out, forbade Harris from creating any policy distance between them during the campaign. A new book by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes, “Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” provides several examples of how Harris knew she needed to appear as a change agent compared to her deeply unpopular boss. But Biden had appointed her as his VP, quickly endorsed her candidacy, and in doing so, shut down any chance of a rapid primary — at the cost of her continued loyalty. While Biden publicly said that Harris had to do everything to defeat Trump, in private, he reminded her once again: “Not even daylight, kid.” That was a message Biden’s aides reinforced with Harris at nearly every stop, according to the book’s authors. For example, when Harris was preparing for her first joint television interview with her running mate, Tim Walz, veteran Democratic communications strategist Stephanie Cutter gave her a list of achievements she could say she was proud to have shared with Biden. Harris’s loyal adviser, Sean Clegg, pushed back: “Let’s not turn this into a memoir.” He was absent from the next round of media prep sessions. During the interview with CNN, Harris found herself reciting a laundry list of Biden’s policies. Even worse, she sat in a lower chair than Walz. That may sound petty, but the visual only reinforced the perception that she was afraid to answer tough questions about the White House’s policies over the past four years and that she wasn’t built for leadership. On the day of the infamous debate against Trump, Biden called Harris to wish her luck and once again stress the loyalty he expected. It took him just a few words to make it clear how important it was to him: “Not even daylight, kid.” Later, in one of the campaign’s pivotal moments, Harris said on The View that “I can’t think of anything I would have done differently from Biden.” In hindsight, of all the many reasons for Harris’s defeat, that may have been the most critical. At least six million people who voted for Biden in 2020 did not vote for Harris in 2024. Polls conducted since then repeatedly show that the main reason was Harris’s refusal to distance herself from Biden’s policies, both at home and abroad. “We played it too safe,” Tim Walz said last week in a media blitz aimed at 2028. “We should have gone to places that don’t like us, met voters and heard them yell at us. But we were always on the defensive.

she's judged on her clothes.\n\nToo conservative, too boring, too expensive, too matronly, too flashy – all are accusations that have been leveled in recent weeks at Leavitt who is, by any measure, atypical of Generation Z.\n\nBoxy blazers, boucle skirt suits and jersey minidresses, this is a wardrobe that is a world away from the couture creations worn by the Trump family itself.\n\nOn a salary of $180,000 a year Leavitt could hardly hope to compete with the financial demands of First Lady Melania's Dior-filled wardrobe, but she could certainly afford more aspirational, youthful choices.\n\nInstead, the sixth woman to hold the position since 2017 seems to have willfully ignored the examples of her predecessors (both on the Right and Left).\n\nEschewing the model-like propensities of Kayleigh McEnany, Leavitt has maintained a cautious and controlled formality – even frumpiness.\n\nHer look is as far removed from her former boss (Leavitt worked as McEnany's assistant in the first Trump administration) as it is from the kaleidoscope of colors and striking silhouettes that were a constant in the reigns of her Democratic forbearers Jen Psaki and Karine Jean-Pierre.\n\nAnd it's all because Leavitt is a woman who has quickly recognized that the most powerful backdrop for a forceful message is an outfit that seems to say nothing at all.\n\nFinding her niche in styles which have ensured her words, rather than her wardrobe, do the talking point, Leavitt has – like Hillary Clinton, Kamala Harris, and current White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles – come to appreciate the value of a non-descript pantsuit.\n\nStepping up to the lectern for her very first press briefing, she chose a $109 purple blazer from Zara and coordinating $49.90 trousers that felt more schoolteacher than political powerhouse.\n\nHer black patent and rhinestone-studded Jimmy Choo pumps might have added a touch of youthful pizzaz to the conservative ensemble had it not been for the unusually large diamond cross that hung around her neck.\n\nIt was an unmissable and rather ostentatious reminder that Leavitt's star rose as a conservative firebrand at the Benedictine liberal arts college, Saint Anselm, in Goffstown, New Hampshire which she attended on a softball scholarship.\n\nHer passionate op-eds in the college newspaper defending the 2017 Trump travel ban paved the way for her political future and marked her out as curiously regressive amongst an overwhelmingly progressive majority.\n\nLeavitt has chosen to extend this winning formula through dress and has fully (and, I think, strategically) embraced a persona that is seemingly out of step with her generation and position.\n\nMarried to a man thirty-two years her senior and mother to an eight-month baby son, Leavitt is a full-on 'trad wife', except for the fact that she occupies one of the most powerful roles in American political life.\n\nResisting the urge to use the podium as a catwalk, Leavitt has astutely understood that her success lies in silhouettes that seem more appropriate to a woman approaching middle age than one on the verge of thirty.\n\nWhile opting in for full 'Republic glam' – glossy blond hair and skin smoother than her baby's bottom – and save for the occasional Louis Vuitton handbag or black leather dress (Super Bowl 2025), she has resisted the informality or unrestrained theatrics in which so many celebrities of her age indulge.\n\nIndeed, what might pass as her most fashion forward moments have been a series of shimmery boucle dresses from the British brand Self-Portrait.\n\nAt first glance depressingly bland, it's tempting see this choice of a brand once favored by the Princess of Wales as a courtly nod to the monarchical aspirations voiced by her presidential boss.\n\nBut however conservative Leavitt's dress sense she is, I believe, an enthusiastic innovator who has learned the lessons of her generation's social media moment.\n\nUnapologetic in her treatment of the traditional media outlets she dislikes, Leavitt has welcomed reporters from 'new media.'\n\nA catchall description for influencers and podcasters, this group have now been allocated front-row briefing room seats that were previously reserved for White House staff.\n\nLeavitt has used their presence just as powerfully as her microphone to champion a thus far winning political narrative - and largely because she has defied her critics to become one of the most effective exponents of the new administration.\n\nLeavitt has disguised her ingenuity in an unremarkable wardrobe, making her Trump's not-so-secret weapon who hides her power in plain sight.","summary":"Messaging for many of the men in Trump 2.0 has, at least in recent days, gone rather embarrassingly off the rails.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14547717/Karoline-Leavitts-frumpy-fashion-critics.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/15/96677357-0-image-m-49_1743175594005.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/03/19/8362160088159961604/1024x576_MP4_8362160088159961604.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-28 20:39:12","author":"Editor,Jane Marguerite Tippett","authors":["Editor","Jane Marguerite Tippett"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.07},{"id":305296300,"title":"Law firm Skadden cuts $100 million pro bono deal with Trump to avoid executive order","text":"Washington — President Trump announced Friday that the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom agreed to provide more than $100 million in pro bono work for initiatives backed by his administration.The agreement makes Skadden Arps the second major firm to reach a deal with Mr. Trump amid a recent blitz of executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents. The orders issued by the president have focused on the firms Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale.All three of those firms have filed federal lawsuits challenging the executive orders as a violation of the First Amendment. A federal judge in Washington blocked parts of Mr. Trump's executive order against Perkins Coie earlier this month.While Mr. Trump earlier in the month issued an order going after a fourth firm, Paul, Weiss, it was rescinded after the international firm agreed to provide $40 million in free legal services to support causes backed by the administration.The president said in a statement posted to Truth Social that in addition to providing $100 million in pro bono work, the firm will not engage in \"illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" and work with an outside counsel to advise it on employment practices.Mr. Trump also said Skadden Arps \"will not deny representation to clients, such as members of politically disenfranchised groups, who have not historically received legal representation from major National Law Firms, including in pro bono matters, and in support of non-profits, because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"The White House said Skadden Arps approached the administration \"and declared the Firm's strong commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession.\"Jeremy London, the firm's executive partner, said in a statement distributed by Mr. Trump that it is \"pleased to have achieved a successful agreement with President Trump and his Administration.

He revoked the security clearances of former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and other top Biden administration officials, as well as others who have been critical of him, last week. Mr. Trump also pulled the security details for Dr. Anthony Fauci and retired Gen. Mark Milley, who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Trump and Biden administrations.The law firm-related orders take issue with the work they have performed and the lawyers previously on their payrolls. In the directive targeting Perkins Coie, Mr. Trump attacked the firm for representing Clinton during her 2016 presidential campaign and hiring a research firm that retained a former British spy, Christopher Steele, who produced the infamous \"Steele Dossier.\"The president's order attacking Jenner & Block singles out the firm for hiring Andrew Weissmann, who worked with former special counsel Robert Mueller on his investigation into Russia's efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election. Weissmann left the firm in 2021. It also took issue with Jenner & Block's work on a challenge to Mr. Trump's executive order that seeks to strip federal funds from medical institutions that provide gender-affirming care to minors, among other lawsuits.","summary":"President Trump has issued executive orders targeting law firms that have employed his purported political opponents.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/law-firm-skadden-cuts-100-million-pro-bono-deal-trump-avoid-executive-order/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/03/28/132615dd-4ee9-4f3a-9630-f904e7e42e1d/thumbnail/1200x630/fa6ddae7dded7cb720d558d14f1f3a26/gettyimages-2207076290.jpg?v=95354023eeb6141c58c08d9a5716f291","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3640247_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-03-28 19:22:54","author":"Melissa Quinn","authors":["Melissa Quinn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":305281840,"title":"Democrats worry on ‘how f***** they are right now as a brand’ and their descent into the minority against Trump and MAGA","text":"Democrats are “f***** right now as a brand,” one strategist warned, as others said the party risks becoming a “permanent minority” against Donald Trump’s MAGA movement. \n\nAfter Kamala Harris’s devastating defeat against Trump in November, the Democratic Party is struggling to find its footing and is “deeply fractured, and rudderless,” strategists, elected officials and leaders told Politico in a scathing report. \n\n“I don’t know if Dems realize how f***** they are right now as a brand,” one anonymous party strategist told the outlet. \n\nWhile the Trump administration steams ahead at a breakneck speed, the Democrats have been distracted by party infighting over their lack of resistance to a short-term spending bill. \n\nSen. John Fetterman, who believes the party needs to change its approach when reacting to Trump’s aggressive agenda, said that if the party doesn’t get its “s*** together” soon, Democrats risk becoming “in a permanent minority.”\n\n“We really got our asses kicked in, and especially in the Senate, we could have been left a gigantic, smoking hole in the ground,” Fetterman told Politico. “We could have easily lost Michigan, Nevada and Wisconsin, and we could be staring down, 56-44.”\n\nOthers expressed frustration that no lessons appear to have been learned from the 2024 presidential election and the issues that appealed to voters. \n\n“In the wake of the election, I kept asking people what the campaign could have done better. And the answer was a whole lot of nothing,” Pennsylvania-based strategist Tommy McDonald told Politico. “I’m not sure folks are open to learning any lessons.”\n\nThere is a belief among some in the party that they will take back the House in the 2026 midterms, which Rep. Seth Moulton said was a “dangerous assumption.” Moulton publicly questioned allowing transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports following the 2024 election defeat. The Trump campaign repeatedly attacked Harris and the Democrats over the heated issue. \n\n“I think it would be a massive mistake not to come out of this election and make changes,” Moulton said. “Everyone said we would win the House this year. Now people are saying, ‘Oh, well, we’ll surely win the House in the midterms.’ That’s a very dangerous assumption when we lost across the board.”\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCathy recently said that Trump has broken the Democratic party. “It is a huge mess,” said the former speaker, The Hill reported. “If you think about it, they are leaderless. There’s no message, and their polling continues to drop. They are now fighting among themselves...It wasn’t just that President Trump won the election. He has now broken the Democratic Party.”\n\nThe former speaker warned that the two minority leaders — Hakeem Jeffries and Chuck Schumer — would not remain in their posts at the current rate. The two men, he argued, had little to no control over their own caucuses and were not making themselves known to the American people.\n\nMcCarthy insisted the real figures of leadership in the party were Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Bernie Sanders, who embarked on a nationwide tour last week to rally disaffected Democrats in the wake of Trump’s inauguration. The pair brought in crowds numbering in the tens of thousands in cities including Denver and Tuscon.\n\nAdditional reporting by John Bowden","summary":"While the Trump administration implements its aggressive agenda at a breakneck speed, the Democrats have been distracted by party infighting","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-minority-trump-maga-b2723529.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/14/19/55/GettyImages-2194398394.jpg?trim=0,0,1,0&width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/SBxqzvxj-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-28 19:12:08","author":"Rhian Lubin","authors":["Rhian Lubin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.684},{"id":305262466,"title":"Lefty shoplifters target Whole Foods claiming they are ‘liberating’ items from ‘Lex Luthor’ Jeff Bezos","text":"Remorseless lefty shoplifters are targeting Whole Foods supermarkets, claiming they aren’t doing anything wrong because they are simply “liberating’’ items from billionaire “Lex Luthor’’ company owner Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe uber-successful businessman’s incredible wealth, the marketplace dominance of Whole Foods’ parent company Amazon and Bezos’ controversial conservative shift as owner of the Washington Post are being used by the woke criminals to justify their petty, passive-aggressive snatching of items, Business Insider reported.\n\nJesse, one of nearly a dozen Whole Foods thieves interviewed by the outlet, said he would often steal entire bags of groceries, including expensive steaks, from the store with his roommates.\n\n“I never felt bad for the corporation as a whole because it was Amazon and, you know, it was Jeff Bezos,” said Jesse, a pseudonym used to conceal the identity of the 30-something tech worker. \n\n“He just profits so much taking advantage of the little people, so if we as little people can bite back a little bit, and that’s me taking $100 maybe out of revenue for him, that’s a little bit of a middle finger,” he added.\n\nAnother regular Whole Foods thief named Carson said he and his friends joke that they’re not stealing items from the store but “liberating” them.

While frustrated, he said he doesn’t blame the customers for taking advantage of Amazon’s liberal return policy.\n\n“I’m not saying I agree with it, but I fully understand the people that view that they’re giving it to ‘The Man,’ but the reality is that you are actually hurting small businesses,” he said.","summary":"Remorseless lefty shoplifters are targeting Whole Foods supermarkets, claiming they aren’t doing anything wrong because they are simply “liberating’’ items from billionaire “Lex Luthor’’ company owner Jeff Bezos.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/us-news/shoplifters-target-whole-foods-claiming-they-are-liberating-items-from-lex-luthor-jeff-bezos/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/101281243.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/G6ZAVR8n-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-28 18:10:30","author":"Patrick Reilly","authors":["Patrick Reilly"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.303},{"id":305252718,"title":"Speed Vs.

We may soon find out. In recent weeks, both public- and private-sector leaders have intensified efforts to accelerate U.S. AI development, spurred in part by a wave of comprehensive state-level regulations in places like California, Colorado, and Utah.\n\nAmong the key voices is OpenAI, which—just before the March 15 deadline—submitted a detailed proposal in response to the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy’s (OSTP) call for input on a national AI action plan, alongside many thousands of other public comments. In its submission, OpenAI urged the government to reduce regulatory burdens, arguing that a more flexible approach would better position the U.S. to lead the global AI race.\n\nPhoto of the United States Capitol overlayed with human and robot fingers meeting.\n\nAI innovation and regulation are colliding across borders—will the U.S. keep up?\n\nReferred to as part of OpenAI’s “freedom-focused policy proposal”, OpenAI’s proposal calls for lessening existing regulatory burden while increasing voluntary collaboration between the industry and the federal government. According to OpenAI, such an approach would strengthen the nation’s lead on AI, as it would enable it to develop faster. In addition, the proposal urges the government to create a framework for the said voluntary partnership, while providing the private sector relief from proposed AI-related bills introduced in various US states. Such relief, according to the document, would serve to advance innovation and would prevent other players in the global AI race, especially China, from benefiting from regulatory arbitrage being created by individual American states.\n\nOpen AI CEO Sam Altman speaks during a talk session (Photo by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe AI arms race is on—and so is the race to regulate it\n\nWhile the global AI race might be a relatively new thing, the tension between innovation and regulation is not. Scholars have been discussing for years this tension, exploring if and to what extent regulation stifles innovation. And while innovation-related concerns frequently accompany regulatory proposals, they appear to resonate most powerfully in the context of data management and information privacy—highly relevant aspects of AI governance—where the balance between progress and protection remains deeply contested.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nAutomatic Password Hacking Machine Confirmed—Stop Using Passwords Now\n\nMicrosoft Warns 1 Billion Windows Users—Do Not Use Password\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Friday, March 28th\n\nWhile it is essential to protect consumers, businesses, and institutions from the unintended—and at times even intentional—harms of emerging technologies, the mere possibility that regulation could slow innovation should not serve as a blanket excuse to reject reasonable safeguards. To be sure, overly burdensome regulation in fast-moving and evolving sectors like technology may hinder the pace of innovation—a dynamic often referred to as “RegLeg,” where regulation inevitably lags behind technological advancement. But that reality underscores the need for smarter, more adaptive governance and regulatory technology tools—not the absence of those.\n\nThe global AI race is something the administration has on its mind.\n\nCompared to other types of technologies, in AI the regulators’ balancing task is even more delicate. For one, the safety risks associated with AI have been described as more alarming than other innovations. From existential risks to humanity, with ‘Godfather of AI’ Geoffrey Hinton warning that there is an up to 20% chance of this happening within 30 Years; through risks of having humans develop irreversible dependency on AI that would erode human abilities and expose them to manipulation by AI; to transforming the job market in unprecedented manner; to causing breaches of privacy or enabling biased and unfair decisions made by AI that would affect individuals in a various ways – AI today challenges regulators around the world in ways never considered in the past.\n\nFrom Brussels to Beijing, global powers are rewriting the rules of the AI race\n\nDr. Karni Chagal-Feferkorn, an expert in comparative law and AI, explains that different jurisdictions are navigating the tension between protecting the public interest through regulation and maintaining a competitive edge in the global AI race. The European Union, she notes, is the first major power to implement comprehensive, binding AI regulations that apply to both European and non-European entities. This positions the EU as a global standard-setter and could give European companies an advantage, as their systems are already designed for compliance. However, the regulatory burden may also deter innovation within the EU and discourage foreign companies from engaging with the European market due to costly compliance obligations.\n\nBuilding on this perspective, Jan Czarnocki, co-founder at White Bison, a Swiss-based consultancy for AI and compliance cautions that the EU AI Act has introduced significant uncertainty and is likely contributing to delays in the rollout of downstream AI systems. He attributes this, in part, to the challenge of translating complex technical AI concepts into clear, actionable legal norms—and then effectively communicating those norms to the engineers and developers responsible for implementation. The disconnect between legal and technical teams, each operating with different incentives and priorities, adds another layer of complexity. As legal professionals gain increasing authority over AI deployment decisions, new internal stakeholders are introduced, making the organizational process of adopting AI systems more cumbersome.\n\nAn icon representing Artificial Intelligence is being displayed on a smartphone, with AI and EU ... More stars visible in the background, in this photo illustration. (Photo by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\nNurPhoto via Getty Images\n\nIn contrast to the EU’s binding regulatory approach, Israel—often dubbed the “start-up nation”—has opted for a lighter-touch, voluntary framework aimed at fostering innovation. According to Josef Gedalyahu, Director of the AI Policy & Regulation Center at Israel’s Ministry of Innovation, Science & Technology, regulators have been explicitly instructed to avoid mandatory rules whenever possible, with recent news reports announcing their decision to opt for tools like self-regulation and regulatory sandboxes. This approach, now echoed by proposals from OpenAI in the U.S., reflects Israel’s strategy to maintain its status as a global tech leader by positioning regulation as a facilitator rather than an obstacle to innovation.\n\nFinally, China, which is arguably United States’ primary rival in the global AI race, has taken a markedly different regulatory path. According to Tehila Levi, an attorney at Sullivan Worcester specializing in Asia, China’s approach combines elements seen in other jurisdictions. Since 2021, it has introduced several regulatory measures, most notably the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) and China’s algorithm filing framework, which requires AI companies to register in a national database. This filing requirement enhances government oversight and transparency but imposes few additional compliance burdens. While China does regulate AI—primarily to protect national security—its framework remains comparatively light-touch, helping to sustain its momentum in AI development.\n\nTOPSHOT - This photo illustration shows the DeepSeek app on a mobile phone in Beijing on January 28, ...

Meanwhile, several U.S. states continue to enforce—or plan to introduce—AI regulations, often targeting specific sectors such as insurance or consumer protection. Rolling back these state-level laws would not only reduce governmental oversight of AI systems but also remove key incentives for developers and users to adopt precautionary measures. This could be potentially troubling given the high-stakes risks associated with AI. At the same time, echoing OpenAI’s recent proposal and reducing regulatory burden—if paired with strong public-private collaboration and robust voluntary safeguards—could preserve innovation without sacrificing safety.\n\nWASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 30: U.S. President Joe Biden hands Vice President Kamala Harris the pen he ...

In reality, moderate Democrats largely declined to speak out about trans rights on the campaign trail. The Democratic National Convention, for instance, did not feature any trans speakers for the first time since 2012.\n\nIn an October 2024 interview, Fox News host Bret Baier asked Vice President Kamala Harris whether she would support gender-affirming care for people incarcerated in federal prisons if elected president — a central focus of one of the Trump campaign’s major attack ads.\n\n“I will follow the law,” Harris said. “And it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed.” Her response was emblematic of the Democrats’ preferred line: pivot to focus on the law, but avoid defending trans people specifically.\n\nThe right-wing attacks on trans people are so vicious and pervasive — and Democrats’ response so milquetoast — that it can be easy to forget recent history. Not that long ago, legislation targeting trans people was quite rare. And when it was implemented, it faced widespread pushback.\n\nNine years ago, North Carolina Republicans passed the state’s infamous “bathroom bill,” or HB 2. The first law of its kind in the country, HB 2 mandated that trans people use the bathroom matching the sex on their birth certificate and banned municipalities from passing local nondiscrimination ordinances. I was a senior in high school at the time, and I, like many other North Carolinians, remember the controversy well. It triggered a massive boycott, totaling as much as $3.8 billion in economic losses for the state, and likely cost Republican Gov. Pat McCrory reelection. North Carolina has had a Democratic governor ever since, despite swinging red for Trump in each of the presidential elections.\n\nLooking back from the vantage point of 2025, it’s pretty shocking to see how full-throated the opposition was to HB 2’s attack on trans people. The law’s passage incited the National Collegiate Athletic Association to pull nearly two dozen championships from North Carolina in 2016 — a massive blow to a state known for its love of college sports. The National Basketball Association also moved its all-star game from Charlotte, North Carolina, to New Orleans, Louisiana. Major corporations, from Coca-Cola to Apple to Ralph Lauren, called for a veto of the bill. PayPal announced it would cancel its multimillion-dollar expansion in Charlotte, and Google’s venture capital wing said it wouldn’t invest in any North Carolina start-ups until the law was repealed. Major television and film production studios, including Lionsgate and the A&E network, stopped filming in the state.\n\nPerhaps even more striking were the travel bans. Cities and states implemented policies prohibiting government employees from taking publicly funded trips to North Carolina. These included the states of Washington, Connecticut, New York, Vermont and Minnesota, as well as the cities of Santa Fe, Salt Lake City and San Francisco, among others.\n\n“As long as there is a law in North Carolina that creates the grounds for discrimination against LGBT people, I am barring non-essential state travel to that state,” said then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo in 2016.\n\nOf course, that was the era of peak corporate pride. The companies speaking out against HB 2 did so because defending LGBTQ rights was in vogue, and they wanted to help their bottom lines. This is abundantly obvious in 2025, as companies now rush to roll back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, proving rainbow capitalism’s critics were right all along. How far we have strayed from the days when public opinion at least leaned in the direction of “discrimination is bad.” Less than three months into this year, 40 anti-trans bills have already passed, and another 725 are currently under consideration.\n\nThis current blitz of anti-trans legislation, when held against the far-reaching, multisector boycott of HB 2 in 2016, shows how far right this country’s politics have swung. But this history also underscores the axiom that progress isn’t linear. We are in a reactionary moment, yes, but the average U.S. voter’s alleged antipathy toward trans people is far from a settled fact. In light of the unpopularity of abortion bans, Republicans have chosen trans people as their newest wedge issue, scapegoating the LGBTQ community through fearmongering and lies.\n\nNow is not the time for the left to cede any ground to a movement that wants to see trans people eradicated from public life. We must continue to defend the rights of the trans community, not because it is sometimes popular, but because it is always right.","summary":"Republicans are using trans rights as a wedge issue.

When the person sitting next to me raised US president Donald Trump’s tariffs and threats to annex Canada, we made some cynical jokes before she said, softly, “It’s starting to get scary.” I knew what she meant, and hearing it out loud felt validating. \n\nFor a long time, most people I spoke to treated Trump’s “fifty-first state” threat like a joke or brushed it off entirely. Two American friends assured me it would never happen, one saying it wouldn’t benefit the Republicans electorally since Canada would vote Democrat. I pointed out that a scenario in which the US illegally annexes Canada might not be one where normal voting practices apply. But my friend wasn’t really having it. Meanwhile, few Canadians seemed eager to discuss it seriously at the time. None of us, I think, wanted to entertain the possibility of the US turning its imperialist ambitions toward Canada. \n\nYou’ll sometimes hear the argument that talking about Trump’s threat helps normalize it. The approach echoes a broader ethos of how the media might approach Trump’s other imperialist threats, which he’s also levelled at Gaza, Panama, and Greenland. Recently, for instance, Jelani Cobb, dean of Columbia University’s journalism school, said in a Q&A with the Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism that the media should treat Trump’s threats to take over Gaza “the way we would treat a tantrum from a child. When your kids are little and they fall out on the floor, you just ignore it. You don’t want to reward that behaviour. Otherwise, you get more of it. The key thing is policy. So unless [Trump] shows up with a blueprint showing how they’re going to build condos in Gaza, then it’s just more talk from him.” \n\nI know covering Trump isn’t easy, and Cobb concedes there’s no simple approach. He also acknowledges his response is a “gut feeling” and by no means definitive. But if the media, and the public sphere more generally, treat Trump like a kid having a tantrum, doesn’t that give him a kind of tacit permission to act like one? And when it comes to Trump’s annexation threats against Canada, especially considering the immense power he wields, I wonder if a reluctance to engage isn’t just a strategic approach but also an aversion to the genuine fear and anxiety that come with recognizing its significance. \n\nBecause really, hasn’t Trump already normalized the threat by virtue of his position? How else should one interpret an authoritarian president of the United States posting two maps on Truth Social, his social media platform, with no Canada, just the US stretching across the provinces and territories? \n\nAnd don’t American politicians and mainstream media outlets normalize the threat by refusing to speak out against it, some even entertaining the idea? In this way, I see the approach not unlike how Democratic elites and presidential candidate Kamala Harris responded to Trump’s racist lies about Haitian immigrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, during the one and only US presidential debate: it was laughed off, seen as a joke, turned into a meme. Now, Trump has ended temporary protection status for half a million Haitians living in the US. \n\nGive Trump the Isolation He Craves\nWhy Won’t Trump Shut Up about Canada?\nHow Trump’s Tariffs Put Canada on a Collision Course\n\nAlthough Trump’s threats to annex Canada, or Gaza, or Panama, or Greenland—which he’s vowed to take “one way or the other”—might be shocking, they’re a particular culmination of the fascistic “Make America Great Again” project. The slogan that’s gone on to become a vitriolic ideology harkens back to a fictitious past where the US was strong and life for (white) Americans was good. I’ll be the first to admit that I thought Trump would stay focused on domestic issues. International allies and causes would suffer, and a diverse range of people all over the world would face harm, sure, but a new phase of old-fashioned American imperialism seemed far-fetched. \n\nI should’ve known better. If the goal is to go back to an unspecified time when America was “great,” US history is rife with examples of the country seizing sovereign territory to benefit its interests. First and foremost, the target was Indigenous lands, seized through violence or sometimes purchased from other foreign powers like Russia or France. The Mexican-American War from 1846 to 1848 added large parts of the west and southwest to American jurisdiction. Later, the US set its sights on overseas territories with a coup in Hawaii in 1893, the invasion of Puerto Rico, and the acquisition of the Philippines from Spain, to name a few. Even today, the American empire includes a massive collection of overseas military bases.\n\nAnd so, when Trump talks of wanting to annex a territory, it’s yet another chapter in this devastating tradition. The US was a colonial project from its inception; it remains one in 2025. The shock some of us might feel in Canada is, I think, the naive belief that American imperial sights wouldn’t turn here. \n\nAnd maybe they won’t. Who knows what Trump will actively pursue. Who knows how myriad historical contingencies will shape what happens in this unrecognizable world we now live in. \n\nStill, the fact that Trump has broadened his “America First” ideology to include explicitly imperialist ambitions means Canadians must confront a public discourse that still seems reluctant, at times, to take these threats seriously. It means confronting our “normalcy” or “status quo” bias, an idea recently deployed by epidemiologist Adam Kucharski, who defines it as “the tendency to prefer that the existing state of affairs continue rather than change.” \n\nComparing the democratic unravelling of the US to the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic in his Substack, “Understanding the Unseen,” Kucharski writes, “Both before and after the pandemic emerged, there was widespread reluctance to acknowledge the reality of such a crisis . . . it now feels like many journalists and public figures struggle to grasp that something new and disasterous [sic] is unfolding in the US. In many cases, I suspect this reluctance stems from an inability—or unwillingness—to face the reality of what’s happening.” In his mind, “COVID and the US situation both represent a crucial variant of this bias, where the status quo has already collapsed, but people still act as if it remains intact.”\n\nWhen the reality is scary and unimaginable, it’s easy to understand why so many cling to a vision of normal that precedes it. Kucharski notes there’s also a tendency to believe that acknowledging a crisis risks making it seem inevitable. But there’s danger in this, as Kucharski stresses. “Because individuals haven’t fully processed this shift, they default to inaction,” he writes, “clinging to the belief that things will return to ‘normal’ instead of recognizing that a fundamental change has already occurred.” \n\nMany have pointed out how such a “status quo” bias restricts action on the climate emergency. I fear this bias also paralyzes how some Canadians view an emerging national crisis. Although there’s more discussion of Trump’s threats nowadays, including what it would mean for Indigenous nations, the continuity of Canadian sovereignty is often taken for granted. (There’s also an argument that Canada has already lost part of its economic independence, thanks to the neoliberal obsession with free trade.) Politicians give us assurances that Canada will never be a part of the US, but with few concrete explanations of how they would ensure that. \n\nThis isn’t an argument for more military spending or waving the flag and singing the anthem. It goes beyond “Buying Canadian” and boycotting American products. It’s about coming to terms with Trump’s authoritarian takeover of the US and the inherent risk this poses to Canadian sovereignty and democratic values, notwithstanding all the back and forth on tariffs. \n\n“Whatever derangement currently occupies conservative American politics is, at least, something of very real consequence: the minority groups they want to legislate out of every facet of society, the books they want to ban, the mechanisms of democracy they want to subvert—none of it is hypothetical,” writes Omar El Akkad in his brilliant new book, One Day, Everyone Will Have Always Been Against This. I would add Trump’s threats to annex Canada to this list. After all, for a chronic liar, Trump can sometimes tell you exactly what he wants to do. His reasons might change—the scourge of fentanyl one day, American banks’ access to Canada another—but the threat stays the same. \n\nThis is the situation Canada faces with what was, until very recently, its closest ally and neighbour, arguably the most powerful country in the world. We’re now in a federal election dominated by Trump and his tariffs, but it’s one in which the scope of the dangers posed to Canada still don’t seem to have fully permeated. Leading candidates Mark Carney and Pierre Poilievre claim they’re the ones who can keep “Canada Strong” and put “Canada First.” But so far, many of the actions proposed by the candidates have focused on tax cuts and the economy, though Carney has recently acknowledged Canada’s traditional relationship with the US “is over.” \n\nPoliticians like to acknowledge it’s tough now, but they promise us that if we elect them, better days are ahead. However, focusing on Trump via the economy doesn’t change the fact that the US has turned authoritarian and its president now speaks of wanting to take over Canada. \n\nOther countries, like Sweden, Finland, Norway, and France, which have a history of invasion or threats of invasion from powerful neighbouring countries, have been bracing citizens for this unstable geopolitical moment by circulating emergency preparedness and survival manuals. These contain guidance on armed conflicts, security threats, climate disasters, and more. Yet here in Canada, the very idea of receiving such a manual seems unthinkable—an admission of weakness, perhaps, not a wise precaution. \n\nThere’s no question in my mind that Trump trying to forcibly annex Canada is, at the very least, a distinct possibility. It’s time to start considering the worst, not just hoping for the best.","summary":"We can’t cling to the belief things will return to normal\n\n\nThe post Is Canada Treating Trump’s Annexation Threat Seriously Enough? first appeared on The Walrus.","url":"https://thewalrus.ca/is-canada-treating-trumps-annexation-threat-seriously-enough/","image":"https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/Trump_Annexation-1800.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 17:00:05","author":"Melissa J.

However, it is time to renegotiate” the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\n“Stronger protection for American-made cars and trucks is long overdue,” Rep. Haley Stevens (D-MI) said in a statement. “I welcome that, but we need to fully understand the details.”\n\nRep. Gwen Moore (D-WI), a sharp Trump critic, told Politico that she views tariffs as “a tool, just like fire.”\n\n“You can barbecue with it, or you can burn your house down, depending on how you use it,” she said.\n\nRep. Marcy Kaptur (D-OH) declined to take a stance on the proposed tariffs, instead calling for broader measures to revitalize American manufacturing.\n\n“We must do more to address the U.S. manufacturing and technology job washout in the automotive and transportation industries,” Kaptur said in a statement. “This will require a lot more than a 25% tariff on automotive imports. We must reinvest in American manufacturing and the working-class communities across our country that have been hollowed out due to broken trade deals and the burden of outsourcing.”\n\nSome Rust Belt Democrats have stood firm in their opposition to Trump’s use of tariffs. Rep. Shri Thanedar (D-MI) said in a statement that he is supportive of “efforts to strengthen the manufacturing industry and the jobs they create” but that tariffs are “not the way to accomplish that.”\n\nMeanwhile, leaders of the United Auto Workers union, which tends to support Democratic politicians and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 general election, voiced their support for the auto tariffs.\n\n“We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working class communities for decades,” UAW President Shawn Fain said in a statement. “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES NEW 25% TARIFFS ON AUTO IMPORTS\n\n“The UAW has been clear: we will work with any politician, regardless of party, who is willing to reverse decades of working-class people going backwards in the most profitable times in our nation’s history,” Fain added. “These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country.”\n\nThe auto tariffs will go into effect Wednesday, and Trump said the federal government would start collecting fees Thursday.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s decision to place 25% tariffs on the auto industry has some Democrats in the upper Midwest walking a fine line between opposing the administration and welcoming its economic measures that could aid the region’s once-prosperous auto industry.

He’s gone from preparing to argue a case before the Supreme Court, making history in the process, to preparing for a second Donald Trump presidency, and now contending with the realities of the new era. \n\nAs a result, he’s had little time to dwell on being the first out trans person to argue a case before the Supreme Court, which he did in December 2024. “I have not really had time to reflect on the experience,” he tells PinkNews. “Overall, though, I felt very supported by my team, and I felt as ready as I could have.”\n\nA decision on the landmark case – LW v. Skrmetti/US v. Skrmetti – is not expected until June. \n\nChase Strangio, the co-director of the LGBTQ & HIV Project at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) argued on behalf of three families and a medical provider that Tennessee’s ban on gender-affirming hormonal therapies for trans youth violates sex discrimination laws.\n\nMeanwhile, Tennessee’s Attorney General, Jonathan Skrmetti, asked for the Court to use its 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Whole Women’s Health, which overturned abortion rights, to also ban gender-affirming care. \n\nThe state argued that its ban doesn’t discriminate on the basis of sex, despite the healthcare in question being allowed for one sex and not another. The expectation appears to be that the case is likely to go in favour of Skrmetti. Strangio, however, remains hopeful.\n\nStrangio’s journey to the Supreme Court is documented in Heightened Scrutiny, which is playing at the BFI Flare: London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival. The film, a powerful call to action against an oppressive wave of bigotry and injustice, candidly follows Strangio as he prepares for the case, his interactions with trans youth, and his reaction to the 2024 Presidential election. \n\n“While I was actually presenting arguments before the Court, I was only thinking about the best answers to the Justices’ questions,” Strangio shares as to whether he was mindful of the significance of his being there in the moment. “Obviously in the lead up to the argument there was a lot of focus on it being the first time an openly trans lawyer would be presenting argument before the Court, but I really tried to keep my head down and my focus on the task at hand.”\n\nBetween his work on the Skrmetti case and previously challenging anti-trans bathroom bans, and Trump’s first trans military ban, Strangio has positioned himself as a leading LGBTQ+ figure, attracting a level of attention he’s not entirely comfortable with and that is at odds with his “good-Scorpio commitment to privacy.”\n\nAt one point in the film Strangio admits what he is preparing for is in “some ways my nightmare.” It struck a note, that it’s almost inherent for queer people to confront the things in life that scare us and to push through. \n\n“I realised that my queerness and transness were things to celebrate”\n\nStrangio agrees. “I do think that being queer and [my] transness has helped me conquer fear in all aspects of my life. At a young age I looked at myself and at the world and thought there was something incompatible, that there was no place for me. \n\n“Over time, as I realised that my queerness and transness were things to celebrate and made the world more expansive not more constrained, I also was able to find possibility in many other places.”\n\nDuring the course of our interview, US District Judge Ana Reyes blocks Trump’s new trans military ban saying it is “soaked in animus” and flat out discriminatory. So, it would appear the legal system is working in delaying Trump’s actions. But in other interviews, Strangio has poured doubt on the legal system’s ability to fight him.\n\n“I think that there will never be a singular way forward and that overreliance on law and legal strategies ultimately just builds the power of the government,” he clarifies. And in terms of a way forward? “I hope that we can use law as a tool to delay harms so that people can build power and generate resources within communities.”\n\nHeightened Scrutiny also draws painstaking attention to the level of influence the media has when it comes to anti-trans legislation. It’s something Strangio doesn’t see improving anytime soon; in fact, he predicts an escalation of it. “It is going to take a concerted effort to shift the narrative away from one that persistently demonises trans people,” he adds. \n\nThe demonisation of trans people was certainly evident during the last election, with Republicans targeting Kamala Harris over her support for the community. Like many, Strangio was not surprised by the election result but admits, “I was devastated,” knowing what the administration had in store for the trans community.\n\nPerhaps more upsetting was in the aftermath of the election the turn by some Democrats, usually pro-LGBTQ+, who began blaming the party’s support for trans people for aiding in Trump’s victory. It’s a turn Strangio has spoken out about himself, his response now – a mixture of anger and resolve – snipes at both sides equally: “Any impulse to strip a group of people of dignity and legal protection will always backfire. I am dismayed but undeterred by all of the attacks on our community. We will find the people willing to fight with us and we will fight for a better world for everyone.”\n\nThere’s a lot of reasons why people generally, not just LGBTQ+ people, in America could feel a sense of hopelessness right now. Strangio understands why but offers a message of hope.\n\n“I just hope that people find the people and systems and support they need to sustain. Mariame Kaba, my favourite person to follow and seek inspiration from, posted a quote from Seamus Heaney today that was grounding for me. ‘Hope is not optimism, which expects things to turn out well, but something rooted in the conviction that there is a good worth working for.’ I believe in that good worth working for.”\n\nHeightened Scrutiny will screen at BFI Flare London LGBTQIA+ Film Festival on 29 March.

The man keeps his word. He did it during his first term, and he&apos;s doing it here in his second. And we&apos;re very happy for it,\" the Auto Workers for Trump founder Brian Pannebecker said on \"The Evening Edit\" Thursday. \"As a matter of fact, his support built every election and got stronger,\" he added. Trump on Wednesday announced new tariffs on auto imports during a press conference at the White House, saying he will impose a 25% tariff on all imported autos, up from 2.5% previously. He indicated the auto tariffs will take effect on April 2, when his reciprocal tariff plans are also expected to be announced. WHEN TO START CAR SHOPPING, DOING REPAIRS AS AUTO TARIFFS LOOM Trump, who views tariffs as a way to bring in tax revenue to finance his plans for tax cuts while spurring a revitalization of domestic manufacturing, previously suggested that he could impose auto tariffs that run \"in the neighborhood of 25%.\" Pannebecker argued the tariffs are a much better result than what Trump’s primary campaign opponent pitched for the auto industry. \"She [Kamala Harris] wanted to ban the internal combustion engine,\" he said. \"That means, basically, get rid of the auto industry and turn it over to China… now even Shawn Fain, the socialist president of the UAW, has gotten on board. So he&apos;s late to the game.

The tooling now is pretty much interchangeable,\" Pannebecker said. \"They change over to new models on the fly. So a lot of the technology allows them to do that very quickly, and they have the excess capacity to do it.\" \"When you hear people like [Ford’s] Jim Farley say, ‘Well, you know, we don&apos;t want to have to do that, and it would be really costly,’ those are just excuses and bluster,\" he further criticized. \"But the fact remains,\" Pannebecker continued, \"if they&apos;re going to be using robotics in the new technology and automation, we want it done on this side of the border, not south of the border in Mexico.

However, Trump has since revealed he's also extended a similar invitation to members of the 2019 Chiefs, who were denied a White House visit by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nIn a statement released this week, Boyle rejected Trump's distinction between that Super Bowl-champion Chiefs squad and the largely similar team that fell to the Eagles back in February. Furthermore, he accused Trump of\n\n'Donald Trump is inviting the Super Bowl losing team, Kansas City Chiefs, to the White House. It's pathetic — a full-blown White House participation trophy,' Boyle said in his statement. 'I thought Republicans didn't believe in participation trophies.\n\n'President Trump claims it's because the Chiefs won the Super Bowl four years ago,' Boyle continued. 'But let's be real: Trump backed the Chiefs this year, they lost badly to the Eagles, and now he's throwing a fake celebration to cope. The Eagles crushed the Chiefs. No stunt or staged photo op will change that. Fly Eagles Fly.'\n\nTrump recently revealed he will host Travis Kelce and the Chiefs at the White House after their 2020 visit was canceled due to the Covid pandemic.\n\nPresident Donald Trump shakes the hand of Chiefs DT Chris Jones before Super Bowl LIX\n\nPennsylvania Congressman and Philadelphia native Brendan Boyle is blasting President Donald Trump for inviting the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House as a sort of 'participation trophy' \n\nSpeaking to Outkick's Clay Travis on Air Force One on Saturday night, Trump said: 'I look forward to having the Eagles. And one other thing, we're going to have the Kansas City Chiefs after that because they missed their turn because of Covid.'\n\nThe Chiefs have yet to comment publicly on the president's statement, and no date has yet been set for their invite.\n\nThere had been some mystery over whether the Eagles would accept an invite, and if the White House had even extended an invitation, but Trump's press secretary Karoline Levitt finally cleared that up earlier this month.\n\n'I know there was a lot of fake news about an invitation that wasn't sent or was sent, we want to correct the record: we sent an invitation, they enthusiastically accepted, and you will see them here on April 28,' said Levitt.\n\nThe President attended the Eagles' victory over the Chiefs in New Orleans but left the game early to fly back to his home in Palm Beach, Florida at an estimated cost of somewhere between $8million and $20 million taxpayer dollars.\n\nTrump previously disinvited the Eagles from the customary Super Bowl-champion White House visit during his first term in 2018. Philadelphia was coming off its first Super Bowl victory, but when Trump learned several players planned on skipping the event, he cancelled it altogether.\n\nWhat's more, Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie has a record of supporting left-leaning politicians, such as Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, although he previously donated to Republicans George W.

They're so great and so loyal. I met Patrick's mother... at the game [the Super Bowl].\n\n'She came over. And Brittany, I've seen so much of Brittany that just, you know, being so loyal and great and beautiful.'\n\nThe Chiefs have twice been to the White House in recent years, although both under the Biden administration in 2023 and 2024.\n\nIn 2023, Kelce wore a bold red suit as he and Mahomes presented Biden with a personalized Chiefs jersey.\n\nA year later, he joked he was going to get 'tased' on stage if he tried to take control of the mic to give a speech.\n\nKansas City ChiefsDonald TrumpRepublicans\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nDonald Trump slammed for inviting Kansas City Chiefs to White House after heavy Super Bowl loss to Eagles\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Pennsylvania Congressman and Philadelphia native Brendan Boyle is blasting Donald Trump for inviting the Kansas City Chiefs to the White House as a sort of 'participation trophy.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14547539/Donald-Trump-Kansas-City-Chiefs-White-House-Super-Bowl-Eagles.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/14/96675525-0-image-a-9_1743171251369.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 14:17:22","author":"Alex Raskin,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.322},{"id":305195570,"title":"UAW Shifts Stance to Endorse Donald Trump’s Tariffs","text":"A well-structured auto tariff policy could bring thousands of jobs back to Michigan within months, according to the UAW.\nThe UAW’s updated position on Trump emphasizes bringing auto manufacturing jobs back to the U.S.\nTypically, the UAW endorses Democratic candidates but this situation is a rare support for Republican policy.\n\nIn a significant shift from past political battles with Donald Trump, which branded him a disruptor to labor, the UAW now fully supports his tariffs.\n\nUAW President Shawn Fain stated that the union commends the Trump administration for enacting a 25% tariff on imported vehicles and parts, declaring it a historic move to rectify the detrimental effects of free trade on traditional working communities.\n\nThis enthusiastic backing stands in stark contrast to the sentiments expressed only a few months ago, when Fain joined forces with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to assert that a Trump victory would likely result in plant closures nationwide.\n\nAlong with endorsing the tariff initiatives, the UAW urged U.S. automakers to bear the extra costs for the sake of their employees, stakeholders, and customers.\n\n“Once automakers adapt their supply chains and investments to the U.S., companies that have profited significantly for years should absorb the cost of these tariffs instead of passing it onto consumers. The UAW would support any legislative or regulatory measures that enforce this,” stated the union. “Workers should not bear the consequences during the reshoring process, especially with potential federal financial support.”\n\nWhile the political views within the union are mixed, Fain’s readiness to support Trump’s tariffs is not universally endorsed by all UAW officials.\n\nAt least three UAW leaders expressed concerns to the Free Press about the implications of Trump’s tariffs, fearing that they could increase costs for automakers to a level that necessitates production halts, thereby resulting in layoffs for their members.\n\nTrump Places Union in Difficult Position\n\nMarick Masters, an emeritus professor of business at the Mike Ilitch School of Business at Wayne State University, states that Trump’s approach aligns with his campaign promise to Make America Great Again, prioritizing American interests.\n\n“Trump has effectively placed the union in a challenging position where they must back his policies despite probably harboring resentment towards him for various reasons,” said Masters.\n\nFain had anticipated a Democrat’s victory in 2026 when renegotiations of the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement would occur among the three countries. However, the status of this free trade agreement is uncertain amidst Trump’s stringent tariffs.\n\n“We certainly don’t want Donald Trump to recommit to an agreement that compromises American jobs,” Fain remarked at an Oct. 1 rally in Detroit supporting Harris. “We need leaders like Kamala Harris who will advocate for deals beneficial to working-class citizens.”\n\nHowever, aligning too closely with Trump’s administration could foster confusion and discord within the union. Josh Pasek, a professor of communication and media at the University of Michigan, believes the UAW’s current stance is less dramatic compared to other industries yielding to Trump.\n\n“What risks do the UAW perceive currently, and what potential advantages might exist? One tactic is to project an image of alignment with the administration,” Pasek explained. “It’s evident that this administration may act with the intention of damaging anyone perceived as an adversary.”\n\nUAW: Thousands of U.S. Jobs Could Return Quickly\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt indicated that the president advised Detroit automakers to “begin investing and shifting production back here.”\n\nThe UAW received this news positively, considering the adverse effects that moving jobs across borders has inflicted on industry workers. The union’s newly revised position emphasizes a focus on achieving a specific policy goal: relocating auto jobs to the U.S.\n\nThey assert that the cost implications of the tariffs could mean thousands of jobs returning “within a matter of months, simply by implementing extra shifts or lines in several underutilized auto plants.” Currently, numerous autoworkers at Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis are facing layoffs after management decided to transfer jobs to Mexico.\n\nSpecifically addressing Stellantis, the UAW reports that over 1,000 autoworkers have been laid off while “Stellantis trucks valued at $100,000 are produced in Mexico for $3 an hour.”\n\n“Our counterparts in Mexico are not our adversaries. They are facing exploitation stemming from corporate greed, which we must work to dismantle,” Fain noted.\n\nStellantis has faced backlash for job cuts last year at its U.S. locations and has encountered a challenging 2024 with issues like declining sales and high inventory levels.\n\nThe recently announced layoffs “could be reversed.”\n\n“These jobs could be reinstated in Michigan immediately with effectively structured auto tariffs,” the UAW stressed.\n\nDiverse Perspectives\n\nCautious union leaders regard the tariff conflict as potentially destabilizing for supply chains and express concerns that it might slow vehicle sales. A decline in sales could precipitate a recession, leading to economic difficulties for union members.\n\nSome members have expressed a desire for Fain to frame the union’s support for tariffs as endorsing strategic measures to enhance American manufacturing, rather than celebrating broad tariffs against North American trade partners.\n\nHowever, expectations that automakers will absorb the tariff costs may be “unrealistic,” according to Harley Shaiken, a professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\n“You can understand the union’s frustration, but it presents a limited solution to the current industry challenges and potential future directions,” he pointed out.\n\nWhile Fain has demonstrated adeptness at the bargaining table and cultivated a sense of inclusion among UAW members, Shaiken believes that aligning with Trump on tariffs erodes that and conveys a mixed message.\n\n“This presents a confusing narrative. Many workers might ponder if he’s aligned with us now, why not support his successors or allies in upcoming elections?” Shaiken cautioned. “That’s the risk — it bestows legitimacy on Trump to formulate future policies that could be detrimental to workers.”\n\nTrump’s campaign appearances in Detroit were met with little enthusiasm from UAW leaders. In 2023, Fain declared that “every fiber of our union is directed towards combating the elite class and an economy that enriches individuals like Donald Trump at the expense of the working class.”\n\n“We cannot continue electing wealthy individuals who lack an understanding of the difficulties faced by those living paycheck to paycheck, expecting them to resolve working-class issues,” Fain remarked.\n\nThe UAW has consistently backed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since its establishment in 1935, according to Gavin Strassel, UAW Archivist at the Walter P. Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs at Wayne State University.\n\nLast October in Detroit, Trump expressed a desire to renegotiate the USMCA, which is an update to the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement that he signed in 2019.\n\n“They will not exploit, rob, or undermine our automotive industry,” Trump stated in a speech where he described Detroit as a developing, “once-great city.”\n\nAt that time, Fain maintained that Trump’s reelection would lead to significant automotive factory closures across the country.\n\nOn the Campaign Trail\n\nBefore securing his initial election, Trump claimed he would utilize regulation to retain jobs and wealth within America, stating that regulatory growth since 1980 has reduced the current economy by 25%. He criticized NAFTA, which is widely opposed by the UAW.\n\n“Hillary Clinton has endorsed trade agreements that have robbed this city and this nation of its jobs and wealth. She supported Bill Clinton’s NAFTA… and backs the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Trump proclaimed at the Detroit Economic Club.\n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, was intended to enhance free trade among 12 countries — the U.S., Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile, and Peru — under the Obama administration, aiming to strengthen economic ties among members, lower tariffs, and promote trade for growth.\n\nTrump gained political leverage by linking Hillary Clinton’s views to her husband’s decision to endorse NAFTA.\n\nPasek interprets Trump’s current rhetoric as a typical strongman tactic, where those in power boast of representing popular support against the elites.\n\n“The strategy involves dividing groups and positioning them to mitigate damage,” he noted. “Inconsistency in union messaging may undermine future anti-administration initiatives. Are unions overly focused on immediate concerns rather than long-term ones?”\n\nSolutions Moving Forward\n\nAnalysts and automakers have openly addressed the potential harm that such significant tariffs could inflict on the industry. However, short-term disruptions in supply and demand are trivial compared to the 30-year repercussions of free trade that the UAW perceives.\n\n“America is in a state of crisis,” Fain declared on Tuesday during an ABC interview, stating that NAFTA contributed to the breakdown of America’s trading system, resulting in millions of lost jobs.\n\n“Tariffs serve as an effort to stem the flow of jobs lost in America over the past 33 years,” he asserted. “NAFTA is detrimental.”\n\nBrian Rothenberg, the UAW’s spokesman between 2014 and 2022, highlighted that the union was the first to advocate for added incentives to purchase U.S.-produced vehicles and especially those made by union workers under President Joe Biden’s electric vehicle initiative. However, those amendments were not included in the final agreement.\n\n“The solution lies in ensuring equal labor costs. Until Mexican wages align with American production costs, among other foreign countries, a level playing field will remain unattainable,” he reflected to the Free Press. “Implementing tariffs based on fair wage standards would eliminate the incentive for companies to relocate operations abroad.”\n\nShaiken concurs, noting that while tariffs can be pivotal in trade discussions, especially regarding China, where no independent unions and suppressed wages lead to competitive advantages for U.S. automakers, caution is required.\n\n“Tariffs can also be destructively harmful especially with close allies in an integrated North American market, resulting in notable damage,” he cautioned, adding, “Nonetheless, it’s important to note the considerable harm caused by both NAFTA and the USMCA, albeit Trump is the one who devised the USMCA he is now fiercely criticizing.”\n\nRather than creating jobs in the U.S., increased expenses may prompt automakers to rely more on automation for production. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and Trump advisor, has long advocated for automation to achieve high production levels.\n\n“The most significant influence on the auto industry over the past decades is not solely attributable to NAFTA, but also to technological advancements,” Rothenberg noted. “A stamping facility that once needed 5,000 workers can now be operated by just 500.”\n\nFrom Fain’s perspective, the drawbacks of ending specific free trade agreements are outweighed by the benefits of supporting Trump’s tariffs.\n\n“The UAW is committed to collaborating with any politician, irrespective of their party affiliation, who is prepared to reverse decades of regressions experienced by the working class during the most profitable periods in our nation’s history,” Fain affirmed. “These tariffs represent a significant advancement for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country.”\n\nThis development may signify a significant turning point, although it has been unfolding for some time, as noted by Masters.\n\n“It has commonly been said that autoworkers are the backbone of the Democratic Party in Michigan,” Masters reflected. “I don’t think that statement holds as true today as it has in the past.”\n\nSenior auto industry writer Jamie L.

Four years later, he won the state, due in no small part to a surge of support from Michigan’s Arab community. \n\nThe president won Dearborn with 42% support during the 2024 presidential election, a significant increase from the 30% he garnered in 2020. He also carried the neighboring Dearborn Heights, where 39% of the residents hail from the Middle East. And in the majority-Muslim city of Hamtramck, Trump received 42.7% of the vote, a staggering increase from the 13.4% he received in 2020. \n\nMany in those communities hold to the Islamic faith, which leans more conservative on social issues. Last year, dissatisfaction with the Democratic Party’s stance on that issue, and other culture war topics, became part of the reason why they rejected the Democrats’ presidential nominee, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and instead moved toward Trump. \n\nTrump made it a point to appeal to those voters again during the Thursday dinner. \n\n“We’re stopping schools from indoctrinating children with transgender ideology, something which people of this room are not happy about,” Trump said at the Ramadan dinner. “I know that for a fact, and it’s a shame what’s happened, but we’re turning it around and turning it around at levels that nobody can even believe. I signed an order — and I think very importantly, also in particular for people in this room — we’re keeping men out of women’s sports.”\n\nThe president also reiterated his focus on bringing peace to the Middle East, an issue that was key to galvanizing support for himself in Michigan last November. Many Arab residents in Hamtramck, Dearborn Heights, and elsewhere in Michigan are immigrants hailing from areas such as Yemen and have relatives who have died in the war in Gaza. They came into Trump’s fold based on his call to end the war that had killed their family members after becoming disillusioned with the Harris campaign over its stance on the conflict. \n\n“When I was in Michigan, I met with so many leaders of faith, and I said, ‘What about your attitude here?’ … They said, ‘Sir, all we want is peace.’ Right, remember Mr. Mayor [Ghalib]? I said, ‘but I understand you don’t mind death.’ They said, ‘No, sir, we want to live. We want to live and we want to be happy.

It was absolutely incredible.”\n\nIn the days after he won the election, Trump dispatched Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, to Israel to convince all parties involved in the war in Gaza to reach a ceasefire deal by the time he took office on Jan. 20. \n\nWhen Israel announced a ceasefire agreement on Jan. 17, Trump credited his efforts in making the deal happen. That view was challenged by some Biden administration officials, while others concurred.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Tucker Carlson ​​Show earlier this month, Witkoff said the deal was sealed “because they [the Israelis, Hamas, Qatar] didn’t want to defy him [Trump].” \n\n“He’s a bad guy to defy. It was the President’s overarching personality. And letting everybody know that success was not an option. It had to be; it was a mandate.

Only a compromised politician who is receiving big bribes in offshore bank accounts. Only a politician getting filthy rich off the destruction of America.\n\n‘My gut says this isn’t just about insanity or radical communist beliefs. This is about bribery. Judges and politicians like this are “on the take.”‘\n\nI’ve also argued for years that Democrats were getting elected through illegal foreign campaign contributions at places like ActBlue.com — this was pure and simple, foreign money laundering.\n\nThis is how Kamala Harris (the worst and most unlikable candidate in history) raised the most money of all time — $1.3 billion.\n\nThis is how Democrat candidates for Congress and Senate were able to outspend GOP candidates with television ads by 4 to 1 (and higher).\n\nThe boatloads of money to run Democrat campaigns has been coming from China, the CCP and the Mexican drug cartels in small amounts (under $200) so there are no reporting requirements. It’s all tied to the open border.\n\nAnd now, word is out the FBI and Congress are about to indict top players at ActBlue.\n\nNow we come to Democrat-appointed federal judges. These are the “enforcers” for this dirty Democrat/deep state conspiracy to destroy America with open borders.\n\nFederal judges like James Boasberg, who is so desperate to keep violent illegal alien gangbangers in the USA at all costs that he even tried to force the Trump administration to turn around the planes in midair carrying these violent gangbangers back to El Salvador.\n\nHow could anyone be this desperate to help the worst scum of the earth?\n\nMy gut says this isn’t just about insanity or radical communist beliefs. This is about bribery. Judges and politicians like this are “on the take.” They are being bribed. They are getting filthy rich from keeping the border open and keeping bad guys in the USA.\n\nWe need to be asking publicly and loudly if Judge Boasberg is on the take from China, the CCP and the Mexican drug cartels.\n\nCould this judge be receiving millions of dollars from the groups who need the border open, the human trafficking, drugs and fentanyl to flow, and the violent gangs like MS-13 and Tren de Aragua to stay in the USA to carry out this vast criminal conspiracy?\n\nI believe many federal judges are on the take.\n\nThere are many ways to deal with these radical, out-of-control, communist judges.\n\nFirst, some want President Donald Trump to ignore the judges’ orders. After all, they have no authority over the president or his executive actions.\n\nSome want Trump and Congress to impeach these judges for acting in violation of our national security.\n\nSome want Trump and his DOJ to indict these judges for treason and have U.S. marshals perp walk them out of their courtrooms.\n\nAll these actions are possible, but I’ll leave the best choice up to brilliant legal minds.\n\nBut I have some additional ideas.\n\nMy gut instincts tell me that, just like Mexico, many American politicians, government bureaucrats and federal judges are bribed by the bad guys, who make billions of dollars from keeping the borders open and the drugs flowing.\n\nIf lie detector tests are given to U.S. Navy Seals, why not judges? If they’re good enough for Navy Seals, and the government makes decisions based on the results, why aren’t they good enough for politicians and judges?\n\nHere is how to stop it, in my opinion:\n\nFirst, forensic audits.\n\nHave Kash Patel and his FBI investigate the judges and politicians. Kash can deputize the thousands of IRS employees now out of a job — I’m sure many of them are talented at investigating financial crimes.\n\nWe need forensic audits of the communist judges trying to stop Trump’s agenda. Something is very wrong. I’m betting they’re on the take.\n\nAudit the judges’ bank accounts. Audit their lifestyles — can they afford their homes, spending, country club memberships, vacations and private schools? Does their income match their assets and lifestyle?\n\nHow about their family members? Do they have “nonprofits” or “NGOs” in the names of spouses or family members? Do they have offshore bank accounts?\n\nSecond, Cayman Islands investigations.\n\nDon’t just investigate and audit the judges and politicians. Go to the source itself — much of this bribery is now kept in Cayman Islands accounts. The U.S. government — thanks to my friend Brad Birkenfeld, who handled the names and bank accounts of thousands of U.S. tax evaders banking in Switzerland — already has broken the code for Swiss bank accounts.\n\nThat’s why the bad guys have switched to the Cayman Islands.\n\nNow it’s time to swarm the Cayman Islands and find out which accounts belong to U.S. judges and politicians.\n\nThird, lie detector tests.\n\nIt’s time — as I’ve argued for years — to demand lie detector tests for politicians, government bureaucrats and judges, and certainly, for the ones suspected of criminal conspiracy. If lie detector tests are given to U.S. Navy Seals, why not judges? If they’re good enough for Navy Seals, and the government makes decisions based on the results, why aren’t they good enough for politicians and judges?\n\nAsk them a few simple questions: Do you take bribes? Are you on the payroll of China and the CCP, or the Mexican drug cartels? Do you have offshore accounts? Are you benefiting financially from open borders or drug trafficking? Is your spouse or family benefiting? Are you being blackmailed?\n\nThis is how we finally stop the politicians, judges and government bureaucrats from selling out the USA.\n\nWayne Allyn Root recently published “The Great Patriot Protest and Boycott Book.” He is host of the nationally syndicated “Wayne Allyn Root: Raw & Unfiltered” on USA Radio Network, daily from 6 p.m. to 9 p.m. EST.\n\nI believe many federal judges are on the take; There, I said it added by Editor One on March 28, 2025\n\nView all posts by Editor One →","summary":"Special to WorldTribune.com Commentary by Wayne Allyn Root, March 27, 2025 I&#8217;ve argued for years that the open border was an intentional plan to destroy America by welcoming in millions of foreign invaders.

Open AI, the creators of ChatGPT, recently released another higher-quality image generator that people have realized allows images to be rendered in the Studio Ghibli house style. Note that this is contra Miyazaki's own wishes (\"I strongly feel this is an insult to life itself,\" the 84-year-old said of overly incorporating technology into art) and possibly a copyright violation, but that's sort of the least of our worries here. The main controversy now is that people have been putting all kinds of famous images into the meme generator—George W. Bush being told about 9/11, Tony Montana in Scarface, etc.—and that the White House has, uh, decided to throw some images of their recent deportations in there too.\n\nSo here's a Studio Ghibli version of the deportation of Dominican woman Virginia Basora-Gonzalez, a 36-year-old fentanyl trafficker who illegally reentered the country and was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers on March 12:\n\n https://t.co/PVdINmsHXs pic.twitter.com/Bw5YUCI2xL — The White House (@WhiteHouse) March 27, 2025\n\nLots of art is political, and lots of political messaging is tasteless, but this type of move by the White House is worth opposing on two fronts.\n\nThe first, less serious front: This is horrible art. It's lazy and just jumping on a sort of boring and already played-out meme format. It's cruel, and there's no discernible deeper meaning. She's fat and crying and engaged in the illegal drug trade—of a very serious drug that has claimed many victims—and thus easy to make fun of on all counts.\n\nThe second, more serious front: We're in the midst of a large-scale deportation effort by the federal government. If they want enduring public support for such a thing, they need to wholly change their demeanor as well as their practices. Deportation is not funny and light; it's using the power of the state to forcibly evict people from their homes, schools, workplaces, and communities. In some cases—like with Basora-Gonzalez or actual violent Tren de Aragua gang members—it is warranted, and the public supports it. In other cases, though it may be legally permissible, the wider public feels conflicted or opposes it: Think of those ICE raids at Mississippi chicken processing plants during Trump's first term and the havoc it wreaked on the industry and those communities—all for what? And regardless of the morality/public sentiment side, the way this is happening is contra what Vice President J.D. Vance explicitly said would happen: \"I think that if you deport a lot of violent criminals and frankly if you make it harder to hire illegal labor, which undercuts the wages of American workers, I think you go a lot of the way to solving the illegal immigration problem,\" he told an ABC News anchor last August. He said the administration would start with deporting 1 million, and prioritize those who are violent criminals.\n\nTell that to 24-year-old barber Francisco Javier García Casique or to 34-year-old Rasha Alawieh, a physician and Brown University professor from Lebanon on an H-1B visa, or to 30-year-old Tufts student Rumeysa Ozturk. Whether it's Salvadorans with tattoos getting swept up and assumed to be gang members or Middle Easterners being punished for their speech, the administration isn't just targeting violent criminals. Maybe you think that's fine or that this type of culling is welcome, but what is actually being done is very different than what the vice president claimed. And getting migration under control could have been kind of a layup for this administration: Toward the end of President Joe Biden's term, Pew Research Center found that about 80 percent of Americans (including a shocking 73 percent of Democrats!) believed the U.S. government was doing a poor job handling the migrant influx. It's possible that simply following Vance's stated plan would have resulted in decent public approval, unlike the inhumane, haphazard, unfocused scheme that has actually played out.\n\nDeportation is not Ghibli. Treating it as such is taking the easy way out. It is harder to carefully sift through evidence to determine who is actually a true threat. But it's important to be scrupulous and thorough because we're talking about the state upending people's lives—throwing them in holding facilities and, in some cases, sending them back to countries where they face punishment or danger, if they have a country to return to at all.\n\nScenes from New York: New York state's budget assumes it will be receiving some $90ish billion from the federal government. It's increasingly looking like this won't happen, sending Gov. Kathy Hochul and state lawmakers scrambling.\n\n\"In the fiscal year ending this month, New York received an estimated $96 billion from the federal government, with roughly $57 billion going to the state's Medicaid program,\" reports The New York Times. \"About $10 billion went to schools, about $4 billion to law enforcement and public safety and $2.5 billion to transportation programs.\"\n\nMy question, as a New York state taxpayer: How was the $54 billion in income taxes not enough? And the roughly $21 billion in sales tax? And the nearly $26 billion in business tax?\n\nNew York is the highest-taxing state and is the second-highest in spending (beat only by Alaska). \"New York State and its localities spent 50 percent more per capita than the national average,\" reports the Citizens Budget Commission (using 2021 data). \"Higher than California (7 percent), Massachusetts (24 percent), New Jersey (55 percent), Texas (71 percent), Connecticut (77 percent), and Florida (101 percent).\" The state collected, on average, $10,331 in taxes per resident—about $4,000 more than the national average. Where is all this money going, exactly? Cry me a river, Kathy Hochul!\n\n As promised yesterday, a thorough treatment of Trump's tariffs by us over at Just Asking Questions featuring special guest Phil Magness: \n\n \"Is it safe to travel with your phone right now?\" asks Gaby Del Valle at The Verge. \"Recent high-profile deportations began with phone searches at airports. What are your rights? The answer: it depends.\" \"When President [Donald] Trump convened CEOs of some of the country's top automakers for a call earlier this month, he issued a warning: They better not raise car prices because of tariffs,\" reports The Wall Street Journal. \"Trump told the executives that the White House would look unfavorably on such a move, leaving some of them rattled and worried they would face punishment if they increased prices, people with knowledge of the call said.\" (It seems like we were getting price controls whether it was Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. Dark.) Luigi Mangione thirst has reached new heights. And the headline means I can't get Nirvana out of my head. \"Top Democrats tell us their party is in its deepest hole in nearly 50 years—and they fear things could actually get worse,\" reports Axios. \"The party has its lowest favorability ever; No popular national leader to help improve it; Insufficient numbers to stop most legislation in Congress; A durable minority on the Supreme Court; Dwindling influence over the media ecosystem, with right-leaning podcasters and social media accounts ascendant; Young voters are growing dramatically more conservative; A bad 2026 map for Senate races; Democratic Senate retirements could make it harder for the party to flip the House, with members tempted by statewide races.\" Since it's Lent, I'm gonna suppress this feeling of schadenfreude.

They’re ignoring the crime rate because their objective … is to demonize the police department, make it seem like there’s not there’s not as much of a crime issue as there is, because their goal is to steal the police budget.”\n\nIn 2024, Chicago had 573 homicides, leading the nation in that category for the 13th year in a row. \n\nThe homicide rate per 100,000 residents in the city was five times higher than New York City’s 377 and three times higher than Los Angeles’s 280, according to an analysis by Wirepoints.\n\n“They want to take that police budget because it’s an extremely high budget and allocated to other resources or projects that they want to accomplish in their tenure in office,” said Napolitano. “It’s destroying our city. It’s evident what’s going on.”\n\nOne of those projects, INVEST South/West, was an “epic fail,” according to Napolitano. \n\nAccording to the city, $250 million in taxpayer funds were allocated for that project, which began in 2019, in an attempt to revitalize southwest Chicago in the hopes of luring businesses to the area. \n\n“INVESTSouth/West is one of the biggest epic fails that they’ve had,” Napolitano said. “Instead of investing in just one neighborhood, in one area, why don’t we make the entire city safe by investing in our police force and the safety of our city, so that investors on a larger scale want to come to all of Chicago, not just specific neighborhoods? They refuse to do that.”\n\nNapolitano also noted that the city’s leadership has used immense resources to support illegal migrants for political purposes, thinking they would get more aid from the federal government if former Vice President Kamala Harris had won the November election. \n\n“The federal government didn’t give us anything when [Democrats] were in office,” he said. “Now, when the administration changed, we’re getting absolutely nothing at all because we’re remaining a sanctuary city, which I was adamantly against in my 10 years in office. So this is just one failure after the next.”\n\nHe also said that his constituents are furious because in his ward, there is not a lot of violent criminal activity, meaning that police resources are directed away from the district to deal with violent crime elsewhere.\n\nThat means when a burglary or other minor crime takes place in the 41st Ward, residents have a more difficult time getting the help they need. \n\n“So it’s an evolution of just pure bull—- by these people,” he said. “The last two administrations are the worst this city has ever seen.”\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Mayor Brandon Johnson’s office.","summary":"A Chicago alderman said that city officials still want to divert funding away from the police department, even though the city was once again the nation's homicide capital in 2024. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/28/us-news/chicago-dubbed-americas-murder-capital-as-democrat-leaders-demonize-police-splurge-on-migrants/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/101274629.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/G6ZAVR8n-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-28 13:41:50","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.472},{"id":305174550,"title":"Why the Paramount-Skydance merger remains in FCC purgatory","text":"FCC Chairman Brendan Carr is unimpressed with CBS and it could be costly for the Tiffany Network, On The Money has learned.\n\nAt issue: A recent push by the woke TV network for the Federal Communications Commission and Carr to drop its investigation into alleged violations of the agency’s so-called “public interest rules” involving the controversial “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nThe inquiry is a lingering sore spot for the network. Not only is it casting doubt on its internal ethics, namely that it unfairly edited the interview with the gaffe-prone Democratic presidential candidate to make her look good in the heat of the 2024 election. It is also a key element holding up FCC approval for CBS parent Paramount’s long-sought sale to independent movie studio Skydance.\n\nIn a recent filing, CBS said its release of the full transcript of the interview shows it did nothing wrong in the editing process and the case should be dismissed. Carr summarily rejected the proposal, saying his investigation will continue.\n\nPrivately, On The Money has learned, he had harsher words for network brass.\n\nCarr believes CBS has done nothing to bring the commission’s investigation to an end, including a fix for the alleged pervasive bias in its programming, according to people with knowledge of the matter. \n\n“The case isn’t close to being settled right now,” is how one FCC official familiar with Carr’s thinking put it to On The Money. “Now CBS could come in and make a big offer for remedies tomorrow, but that doesn’t seem like it’s on the table.”\n\nAn FCC spokesman didn’t return a request for comment. A CBS rep declined to comment.\n\nWithout settlement discussions, the FCC’s inquiry could drag on for weeks, possibly months further delaying the Paramount-Skydance deal.\n\nAs reported by On The Money, Skydance — which has yet to get its hooks into Paramount and could be battling a rival bid for the media conglomerate — is weighing possible remedies to push the approval process along, including an ombudsman to monitor CBS news content and make sure it’s free of bias.\n\nAnother major headache for Paramount is President Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit against CBS over the Harris interview.\n\nWhy does any of this matter for the merger? The FCC is the primary regulator over the broadcast media business that airs programming over public airwaves, as opposed to cable. The agency can deny local broadcast licenses to companies and derail mergers when there is evidence that news content violates its public interest rules by containing obvious political bias.\n\nCBS News has come under fire from conservatives for years over an allegedly left-wing slant in its programming.\n\nMeanwhile, the “60 Minutes”-Harris interview has been steeped in controversy since it aired last Oct. 7. Conservative groups including the Center For American Rights, or CAR, soon discovered that CBS previously had aired a promo of the Harris interview where her answer to a question about the Middle East appeared markedly less coherent than what eventually ran on the program.\n\nCAR filed a complaint with the FCC that triggered the investigation that is now postponing the Skydance-Paramount deal.","summary":"FCC boss Brendan Carr rejected CBS's request to dismiss the complaint over the “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris.

No offense to JEJ, love his work, etc., but the reaction was: What? That guy was still alive?\nThere’s an extra layer of tragedy in learning something was still alive from its obituary. The collapse of the Hooters empire has been in the cards for years (Google “Hooters + private equity” for more on this.) And it’s not as if I’m going to rend my garments on a Sicilian beach for the boobs-and-beer establishment responsible for the worst portmanteau in the English language, namely “brestaurant\" (BREASTAURANT!), though I've always heard the wings were good. (See also: Playboy; “the articles.”) But let’s be real, have you, alive person in 2025, heard anyone mention Hooters once in conversation? Let alone know someone who’s eaten at one? The restaurant isn’t even a cultural punchline anymore, because it simply doesn’t feel like a part of modern culture. It’s a souvenir from a time when men got all hot in their pants for bikini car washes and Jennifer Love Hewitt. A joke in movies from the era when Katy Perry still sang about various things being “so gay.” It’s where George W. Bush went to get a sad cheeseburger after vainly declaring “Mission Accomplished.” (I don’t think this is true, but it feels true in my heart.) It's a symbol of feminist horror from the 90s, when the most offensive thing a man could do is burp like Homer Simpson and insist on ogling cleavage and NASCAR rallies in equal parts. Hooters still existing all this time is like realizing that Newt Gingrich is currently above ground and breathing. (He is—just Googled!) It’s all slightly unnerving.\nIf you told me this news a decade ago, I’m sure I’d have been ecstatic. I’m a card-carrying feminist. Okay, fine, they don’t give out cards, but trust I have Shulamith Firestone and Simone De Beauvoir taking up space on my bookshelf while I scroll TikTok. But strangely, I feel wistful about the restaurant’s demise. Don’t get me wrong—there are plenty of valid and somewhat obvious feminist critiques to be made about a place that makes the sexual objectification of women its selling point. And believe me, they have been made. (By me, in college, for longer than anyone at that party wanted to hear.) But despite those real liabilities, Hooters just seems…silly? A restaurant dedicated to boobs, the googly eyes of the torso! What an artifact of a more innocent time! Like a young man taking his first Victoria’s Secret catalog to the bathroom. Hooters cites flagging foot traffic as the source of its financial woes. Which tracks. No one needs to go to a restaurant to see people dressed like Kardashians. You can just come to Los Angeles. Or Cleveland…in the summer. Or my Pilates class, where there’s this lady who wears a way-too-loose sports bra and I’ve seen her left nipple against my will twice now.\nPlus there’s a healthy dose of camp involved here. I’m sure you’ve seen the crop tops where the owl’s eyes double as, ahem, another body part? I don’t want to give myself away too much, but I’ve come to miss camp in today’s sexual material. (Save for Sabrina Carpenter—thank you for your service, ma’am.) I know none of you fine people have visited Pornhub lately, so let me tell you: gone are the days of the cheesy “I have your sausage pizza right here, ma’am” type of content. Today’s porn purveyors are focused on the real, even if the “real” is fake. It’s all grainy college parties and Blair Witch-style phone-camera work that makes you feel like you ate a funnel cake too quickly after getting off a corkscrew rollercoaster. Artifice in pornography did us a favor. It said to impressionable viewers (i.e. teens with dialup AOL connections), Hello there! We are actors performing sex! Now the prevailing message of pornography seems to be that any of the women rushing past you on the sidewalk could be on their way to a very important gangbang.\nTherein lies the semi-redeeming quality of Hooters—there’s no mistaking it for anything other than it is. It’s sexism, plain and simple. It’s the difference between the guy in your office who says crap like, “Dayum, okay, miniskirt!” and the guy who comes to your office to cry about his loveless marriage for months and then ends up trying to grope your ass at the Christmas party. Yes, sure, they both need to go straight to HR without passing “go”—but at least the first guy is so overt about it that it's downright absurd. That’s the thing I miss. The overtness. Not the overtness of the bouncing breasts as Hooters waitresses sing “Happy Birthday”—yes, they’re told to jump—but of the sexism itself. Whether you want to set foot in a Hooters is a personal choice, but at least there’s no rationalizing it. No one’s ever said, “Actually, this restaurant is good for women because it highlights the evolutionary significance of the mammary gland.”\nIt may seem inane to pick the lesser of two evils when it comes to sexism, but hear me out: the more obvious, the easier to combat. The heyday of Hooters coincided with an era when Rush Limbaugh flat-out called Hillary Clinton a bitch—or “a witch with a capital B,” and Pat Robertson spouted that feminism encouraged women to kill their children and practice witchcraft. It was so ridiculous it really felt like it might be the death knell of patriarchy—these old men yelling at the clouds. People were turned off by it. It cost the GOP two presidential elections. It seemed like we might actually be on the path to gender equality, and it looked and talked like Tilda Swinton.\nBut instead bigotry disguised itself, wrapping itself in Orwellian doublespeak. No one said out loud, in 2024, “I’m not voting for Kamala Harris because she’s a woman.” It was always “She’s unqualified.” Or a grade-school reverse psychology trick—you’re actually sexist if you’re voting for her just because she’s a woman. Or the most horrifying: “I’m voting for Trump to protect women’s rights,” followed by some hazy logic about the dangers of women’s bathrooms. The GOP of today isn’t proudly opining that women should stay home and away from the ballot box—they’re burying a clause that requires one’s current name to match the name on one’s birth certificate inside a “voter security” bill—making voting, if not impossible, then at least a logistical nightmare for women who’ve taken their spouse’s last name. We may have weeded out “Dayum, okay, miniskirt” guys from the ranks of acceptable society, but now we’re faced with Crying Wife Guy, who’s way more manipulative, and frankly, annoying.\nHonestly, it makes me want to drink a few too many Bud Lights at Hooters.","summary":"The cheesy ‘90s sexism that the once-infamous “breastaurant” chain exemplified is a thing of the past—but, argues writer Lauren Bans, the more insidious misogyny that's replaced it is almost certainly worse.","url":"https://www.gq.com/story/bankruptcy-could-shutter-hooters","image":"https://media.gq.com/photos/67e42e3076790d03b43fd205/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/Hooters-%20A%20Requiem.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 12:00:00","author":"Lauren Bans","authors":["Lauren Bans"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.186},{"id":305131840,"title":"Republicans can't squander this opportunity to defund Big Abortion","text":"This week, members of Congress are getting a visit from hundreds of pro-life constituents from across the country, coming to Capitol Hill to urge them to defund Big Abortion. It’s been talked about for years and even included in Republican reconciliation bills in the past. Now is the time to get it done, and the way to do it is in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill. Reconciliation is a complicated process, but the key is, these bills can pass the Senate with a simple majority rather than the usual 60 votes needed to break a filibuster. With a complete GOP majority in Washington, this is a huge opportunity we cannot squander. Americans overwhelmingly support cutting back out-of-control federal spending, with 70% of voters saying government expenditures are rife with fraud and waste. The same percentage of Independents now disapprove of the Democratic Party, the most unpopular it’s been in years. Any anti-fraud-and-waste efforts should absolutely zero out funding to the corrupt abortion industry – especially the hundreds of millions to \"progressive groups like Planned Parenthood\" flagged by Elon Musk. ROE V. WADE IS GONE, BUT ABORTION IS STILL THE NUMBER ONE KILLER WORDWIDE But wait, someone might object, isn’t Planned Parenthood a nonpartisan healthcare provider? If only their slick propaganda resembled the truth. In reality, their priorities are abortion, profits and politics. Planned Parenthood has done more than any other group to make abortion the leading cause of death in America. They ended the lives of nearly 393,000 unborn children in a single year, according to their last annual report, or about 40% of abortions in the U.S. – a number that could fill Times Square to capacity ten times. 97% of the time a pregnant woman walks into Planned Parenthood, she’s sold an abortion rather than helped to keep her child or make an adoption plan. Many Planned Parenthood employees even straight-up admit their center doesn’t do prenatal care or offer ultrasounds apart from abortions: \"It’s called Planned Parenthood, I know it’s kind of deceiving.\" While Planned Parenthood provides fewer and fewer cancer screenings, abortions and income keep setting records. Some of their billions in assets comes from wealthy, elite funders. Some has come from the barbaric harvest and sale of baby body parts for \"research.\" More than a third of their income is from – guess who? – taxpayers. In 2023, their taxpayer funding amounted to almost $700 million or $2 million a day, with a significant chunk coming from Medicaid. And you didn’t even get a \"Thanks.\" A bombshell report in The New York Times, of all outlets, reveals the stark horrors and incompetence Americans are getting for their money: botched abortions that are lethal for babies and put women’s lives at risk. IUDs implanted in women who are already pregnant. Sewage leaking into a recovery room, causing people to vomit. Now they’re also accused of delaying emergency responders in the death of an 18-year-old with late-term abortion complications. The Times noted that, since the Dobbs Supreme Court decision, Planned Parenthood \"has enjoyed a fundraising boom\"…but instead of providing affordable health care, the national organization’s bylaws require most of the money to be funneled into never-ending lawfare and political activism. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Planned Parenthood’s political arm spends more on federal lobbying than any group on either side of the abortion issue. In the 2024 election cycle, they spent almost $70 million lying about pro-life Republicans and pushing to enshrine all-trimester abortion in state constitutions, not including the many millions spent by local affiliates or their PAC. They are political radicals, consistently backing far-Left Democrats like Kamala Harris – the first presidential candidate to campaign at a Planned Parenthood abortion center. In Florida, they allegedly gave the Harris-Walz campaign office space, potentially illegally. The majority of Americans nevertheless rejected Planned Parenthood’s no-limits abortion agenda – yet Big Abortion continues attacking President Trump and his administration. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In his first term, President Trump’s Protect Life Rule stopped $60 million in taxpayer dollars to Planned Parenthood, because their business is abortion, not health care or planning for parenthood. But around half a billion dollars a year comes to them from Medicaid, which must be addressed by Congress through legislation. The pro-life movement is united around defunding Big Abortion, with a coalition of more than 150 national and state pro-life leaders – representing all 50 states – encouraging members of Congress to act on their mandate to root out corruption. The Republican Congress shouldn’t miss this priceless opportunity to fulfill a promise and deliver a huge win for all Americans.","summary":"Republicans should take advantage of their Congressional majority and defund Big Abortion.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/republicans-cant-squander-opportunity-defund-big-abortion","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/1200/675/Planned-Parethood-Sign.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 11:00:53","author":"Marjorie Dannenfelser","authors":["Marjorie Dannenfelser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":305131842,"title":"Biden aides warned donors dropping out and running Kamala Harris would be a mistake: Book","text":"Aides to President Biden told Democratic donors that it would be a \"mistake\" for him to drop out of the race in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris, according to an upcoming book. The Guardian published excerpts on Thursday from \"Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,\" which detailed tensions between Biden and Harris ahead of him dropping out of the presidential race in July. The excerpts showed Biden’s team \"aggressively\" pushed back against donors who considered removing him from the race over concerns about his age. One of the ways allegedly included warning that Harris as the replacement Democratic nominee would be a \"mistake.\" \"One donor on the receiving end of an electronic message summed up the sentiments of Biden’s top aides: ‘They were aggressively saying that we would wind up with the vice-president and that would be a mistake,’\" the excerpt read. TENSIONS ALLEGEDLY RISE BETWEEN BIDEN WHITE HOUSE AND HARRIS CAMPAIGN: 'TOO MUCH IN THEIR FEELINGS' A source also told the book's authors, NBC News reporter Jonathan Allen and The Hill reporter Amie Parnes, that Biden aides emphatically felt \"no one wants\" Harris as a candidate even if Biden left. \"The last threat, the ace in the hole, was Kamala Harris. Even if Biden did drop out and you got your dreamed-up open convention, you would only succeed in nominating the vice-president,\" the source said. \"Is that what you want? You want her? Look at her polling. No one wants her. Forget it. It’s never gonna happen.\" Despite his aides’ defense, the book reported Biden wasn't doing well just two days after his infamous presidential debate against then-candidate Donald Trump in June. In a donors’ reception hosted by then-New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, Biden needed florescent tape as \"colorful bread crumbs [that] showed the leader of the free world where to walk.\" \"He knows to look for that,\" one aide told Parnes and Allen. Additional excerpts released by The Guardian on Wednesday showed Biden also reportedly needed an \"autocue\" to give \"unscripted\" remarks, with the authors writing that he \"didn't look well.\" Even with the Biden team pushing back against Harris, Democrats appeared largely resigned to Harris. ‘Well, at least she has a pulse,\" one veteran operative summarized. After Biden dropped out of the race in July, he endorsed Harris and she swiftly sewed up the nomination with no opposition. She went on to lose the general election to Trump. Fox News Digital reached out to representatives for Biden and Harris for a comment. BIDEN-HARRIS RELATIONSHIP, MEETINGS SINCE ELECTION HAVE BEEN 'FROSTY,' REPORT SAYS An excerpt of the book released by The Hill earlier this month also showed Biden had \"expected Harris to protect his legacy\" as she ran for president and wanted \"no daylight\" between them on her campaign. \"He would say publicly that Harris should do what she must to win.

At some point in the future, historians, political scientists, journalists and other experts will convene to discuss and debate the Age of Trump and how the “world’s greatest democracy” succumbed to autocracy and authoritarianism. The role of the mainstream news media is sure to be prominently featured in any political autopsy.\n\nDuring the 2024 election, the American mainstream news media continued to practice its obsolete norms of “fairness,” “balance,” “objectivity,” and “neutrality.” Coverage remained steadfastly focused on “bothsidesism,” an obsession with the polls and the “horserace,” and inside the Beltway gossip rather than critical coverage of Trump’s campaign and his MAGA authoritarian populist movement. As an institution, the news media did not treat Donald Trump’s chances of victory over the Democrats in the 2024 election with the seriousness and alarm it merited. The result was to normalize and minimize the existential harm that Trump’s return to power would cause the nation. \n\nIn this future political autopsy, media scholar Jay Rosen’s advice and warning to the American news media to emphasize “Not the odds, but the stakes” in its coverage of the Age of Trump will be written in bold or repeatedly underlined.\n\nAt The Guardian, Rebecca Solnit indicted the American news media for its failures during the 2024 election:\n\nThe first thing to say about the hate and scorn currently directed at the mainstream US media is that they worked hard to earn it. They’ve done so by failing, repeatedly, determinedly, spectacularly to do their job, which is to maintain their independence, inform the electorate, and speak truth to power. \n\nUltimately, as an institution, the American mainstream news media did not adopt the prime directive that, in a time of such extreme peril, it should be emphatically and explicitly pro-democracy, rather than just a referee, bystander, or stenographer of current events. This is a failure of principle, self-interestand survival. \n\nDonald Trump has now been president for two months. He is ruling as an autocrat and aspiring dictator who appears to have no intention of leaving office. The news media has, with some exceptions, not risen to the challenge. In his January essay “Why is Trump coverage so feeble?” journalist and media watchdog Dan Froomkin summarizes the news media’s choice to fail: \n\nIn some cases they have been explicitly muzzled — told by their bosses to “be forward-thinking and to avoid pre-judging Trump,” as CNN chief Mark Thompson told his staff, according to Oliver Darcy.\nIn some cases, it’s all internalized; they’re so into being “above the fray” that they’re unwilling to render judgments that might alienate Trump and his voters and subject them to accusations of having “taken sides.”\nBut for whatever reason, by failing to properly situate Trump’s individual acts, they effectively play down the significance of what he is doing. They normalize it.\nLet’s Be Clear\nMost of what Trump is doing is coming right out of the authoritarian playbook....\nHere’s the thing: I believe our top political journalists know full well what is going on, and would actually like to explain it properly to their readers and viewers. They just haven’t figured out a way to do it yet….[O]ur political. journalists need to find a way to get over the view that putting what Trump is doing in its full context is somehow “taking sides” in a partisan political battle. Yes, it’s “taking sides” – but it’s taking sides for the truth. It’s taking side for an informed electorate. It’s taking sides for journalism\n\nAs Robert Kuttner asks at The American Prospect, “where are the firebreaks?” that should be slowing down and stopping the Trump administration and its forces as they rampage against American democracy and society. The firebreak that is the American news media (the Fourth Estate) against Trump’s assaults on democracy, the rule of law and the Constitution has not been effective. \n\nLeading media outlets such as the Washington Post and LA Times are engaging in anticipatory obedience where they are self-censoring or otherwise modifying their coverage and tone to please Donald Trump, his MAGA movement and the larger right-wing. For example, as directed by ownership, the editorial board of the Times did not issue its customary endorsement of a presidential candidate in the 2024 election (Kamala Harris would have been endorsed). To great controversy, the Washington Post also made a similar move. The Post has now gone even further, with its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos issuing a guideline that the opinion section of the paper will focus on amplifying “personal liberties and free markets.\" Opposing views will not be given a platform in the newspaper. \n\nIn his newsletter, historian Timothy Snyder offered the following critique of the logic of “free market” orthodoxy and how Bezos’ decision is doing the work of authoritarianism and plutocracy:\n\nThe assumption that \"free markets\" and \"personal liberties\" work together as \"pillars\" is mistaken. These two concepts are not the same, and very often point in opposing directions. A \"free market,\" for example, would mean that companies can pollute as much as they like. But if the atmosphere poisons me and I die of cancer, I am not enjoying \"personal liberties\" of any sort…\n\nSnyder continues:\n\nThe language of \"free markets\" is authoritarian. Freedom belongs only to people. It does not belong to institutions or abstractions — and least of all to non-existent institutions or abstractions. The moment that we yield the word \"free\" to something besides a person, we are yielding our freedom. And we should be aware that others who abuse the word by taking it from us intend to oppress us. When we endorse the fiction of \"free markets,\" we are entering a story told by others than ourselves, in which we are the objects, the tools, the non-player characters. We are accepting that we people owe duties to those markets. By way of an unreal concept we pass into real submission. We are accepting that we have the duty to oppose \"government intervention,\" which is to say that we must oppose political actions that would help us to be more free: safety for workers, protection for consumers, insurance for banks, funding for schools, legality for unions, leave for parents, and all the rest. We must accept whatever the market brings us, to go wherever the billionaires take us, to surrender our words, our minds, ourselves.\n\nCNN and other television and media outlets are also adjusting their coverage to feature more “conservative” voices and perspectives in what appears to be an attempt to conform with the Trump administration’s desires (and also to avoid retribution). These decisions are justified as responses to a changing “market and declining ratings.\n\nThe acts of anticipatory obedience by the Washington Post and other leading news outlets will have a cooling effect across the entire news media. The many failures of the news media in the Age of Trump (and in the years and decades prior that birthed this era) to, for example, accurately and effectively describe America’s political and social reality and the country’s deep troubles and what to do about them have contributed to its lack of trust and respect among the American people. \n\nLast December, Semafor asked dozens of leading news and media figures what they were wrong about in 2024. The survey should have received much more attention when it was published. It was a rare moment of critical self-reflection and potential soul-searching for a news media that rarely admits its errors and failings because to do so would be a threat to its legitimacy and authority. Some of these failings, errors and oversights included downplaying Trump’s popularity, mistaking Kamala Harris’ “brat energy” and the enthusiasm of her base as compelling evidence that she would win the election and turning a blind eye to Biden’s apparent inabilities, due to age and energy, to effectively campaign against Trump. I have reread Semafor’s survey several times during the last three months. Trump’s shock and awe campaign against American democracy is escalating and the news media as an institution appears to be continuing with many of the same errors (or worse) it made in 2024 during one of the most critical elections in American history. \n\nI asked Brian Karem, who is Salon’s White House columnist, for his thoughts about the media’s failures in 2024 and what he would have done differently:\n\nWe fail in the press because more than 90 percent of what you see, read or hear is owned by six companies who are part of the billionaire ruling class.\nWe are owned by entertainment companies and are treated as cheap entertainment. We produce pap with snap for various news-information silos. More intent on going viral than informing, we are no longer capable, at least most of the time, to produce vetted factual information for the masses. We hire cheap, uninformed and under-experienced editors to bow to the owners, and hire uninspired and under-experienced reporters to produce stories. We neither grasp nor search for anything other than reactions to press releases and official pronouncements. We fail to understand and are proud to be along the ride to doom.\nWhat we got wrong in 2024?\nRather than point to individual stories we got wrong, I will simply say we got all of it wrong by not providing vetted factual information, for failure to communicate, for failure to investigate, understand or search for answers using the scientific method to communication and producing news we can all use.\n\nI also asked Matthew Sheffield, who is a progressive writer, commentator, and media critic for his reflections and insights:\n\nI think the biggest lesson that progressives should take from the 2024 election is that the mainstream news media will never adequately promote our ideas. This is a mistake that should have been realized a long time ago. Paradoxically, even though the mainstream media as always refused to comprehensively document and expose Republican politicians' fanaticism, Republicans still believed they needed to create their own media environment to promote their ideas to the public. And so they did. Democrats actually have more money at their disposal, but they need to start spending it on advocacy media, instead of worthless TV ads that are despised by voters as much as they hate email spam.\nIt's easy to blame voters for staying home or making a bad choice, and they do deserve moral accountability. But unless you have a plan to stop it, raging against the machine only gets you crushed by it.\nThe two things I got the most wrong in 2024 were 1) that I trusted that the Joe Biden White House was telling the truth when they said he was capable of running a full-scale presidential campaign. He very obviously was not, even before his disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump—who actually performed worse, but his aberrant behavior has been, regrettably, normalized for many people; and 2) I underestimated just how little engagement that the Kamala Harris campaign was attempting with younger voters. Trump won the election because of people who had never voted before. And he did it by appearing on countless podcasts, which Republican donors have spent millions creating while Democratic donors pleasured themselves to anti-Trump video ads.\nThe Democratic establishment has failed now twice against Donald Trump, a man who thinks that windmills cause cancer. We can point and laugh at Trump all we want, but since he's won twice now, which politicians are actually the fools?\n\nNathan J. Robinson, the co-founder and editor-in-chief of Current Affairs magazine, offered this call to action:\n\nWe need to build an alternative media infrastructure that is sharply critical of both Trump and the anemic Democratic opposition. That is what we have been trying to do for eight years at Current Affairs, despite having no corporate backing and working entirely off reader support. The people quoted in that Semafor article are right that they were wrong. They do not, however, realize that their wrongness discredits them and shows why people should stop listening to them. Some of us had much better records in 2024. If you go through the archives of our magazine, I think the commentary holds up pretty well. In fact we warned in 2020 that Biden’s presidency would be a failure and Trump would be back. I would encourage consumers of media to switch and follow independent publications that have a good track record of analysis (not just my publication but The Intercept, Lever, Jacobin) and stop paying attention to blowhard pundits who are confidently wrong about everything.\n\nAs an institution, the news media developed extremely poor habits during the Age of Trump. This was preceded by years and decades of bad habits that collectively have now brought the United States to such a low place. Moreover, these are now more than bad habits; they are the dominant culture of the American mainstream news media. \n\nDonald Trump and his MAGA movement are quickly consolidating their power. The American news media is almost out of time to learn new habits and norms by being brave defenders of democracy and freedom. The American news media is now facing an existential collective action problem, where to paraphrase Benjamin Franklin, they need to work together or be defeated alone. The future of America’s news media is clear: If they continue with their bad culture and acts of anticipatory obedience, they will become de facto ministries of state propaganda that are owned by the autocrat and his friends and allies, like in Orban’s Hungary or Putin’s Russia.","summary":"Why the press is ramping up its acts of anticipatory obedience to the Trump regime","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/03/28/the-media-learned-all-the-lessons-from-2024/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/01/donald_trump_2194586606.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 11:00:32","author":"Chauncey Devega","authors":["Chauncey Devega"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.121},{"id":305123378,"title":"Trump more popular than ever? US President takes U-turn on ‘fake news’ CNN, shares clip on 'reality check'","text":"US President Donald Trump has shared a clip from news channel CNN- a network he has time and again derided for disseminating so-called “fake news”. The clip shared by Trump touted his favourability ratings. According to new polling data, Trump's popularity is at a record high as the largest share of Americans in decades believe the country is on the right track.Last week, at the Oval Office, the President said both CNN and MSNBC may be turned off , calling their journalism “dishonest” and stating their ratings are doing “horribly.” But on Wednesday morning, the scenario was different.Trump took to Truth Social to share a video from the very outlet he attempted to discredit in the midst of the fallout over the Signal text leak.ALSO READ: 'I am almost done...': Elon Musk to step down from DOGE and quit Washington DC after $1 trillion in US govt cutsWhat ratings say about TrumpAlthough the president’s current net-favorable rating stands at -4 percent, he is steadily improving. This marks a significant rise from his -10 point rating in March 2017 and the -7 point rating recorded after the November election, according to aggregate polling compiled by CNN analyst Harry Enten. Enten gave the network’s lefty viewers a “reality check” this week with the new poll numbers, showing Trump has a higher favorability rating now than at any point in his first term.Trump's net favorability rating continues to be negative, but Enten suggested looking at the polling in a different way to account for Trump's numbers historically being underestimated. I think sometimes it’s important to do a little bit of a reality check and take a little different spin at the numbers, Enten said. Because all we talk about is how unpopular Donald Trump is, but in reality, he‘s basically more popular than he was at any point in term number one and more popular than he was when he won election back in November of 2024. ALSO READ: Myanmar earthquake: Emergency declared in Bangkok; Thailand's stock exchange suspends trading I think it‘s very important to compare him to himself, to understand he‘s actually more popular now than he was when he won, or certainly where he was at this point back in his first term, Enten said. According to his aggregate numbers, Trump has a net favorability rating of -4 now, compared to -7 when he won in November, and -10 towards the start of his first term in March 2017. So when you compare Trump against himself, he‘s actually closer to the apex than he is to the bottom of the trough. And of course, that‘s so important because Donald Trump, historically speaking, has had his numbers underestimated, he said.“I think it’s very important to compare [Trump] to himself, to understand that he’s actually more popular now than he was when he won, or certainly where he was at this point back in his first term.” How much popular is Trump?Enten broke out polls showing the percentage of Americans indicating that the country is on the right track to explain how popular the President is at the moment. He pointed to a recent Marist survey showing 45 percent of Americans indicate that the country is on the right track- the second highest percentage that the pollster has measured since 2009 – and a NBC News poll finding 44% of Americans thinking the same – the highest since 2004.ALSO READ: World War III soon? European Union tells 450 million people to stockpile food, supplies amid riskEnten emphasized, “The bottom line is that the percentage of Americans who believe the country is on the right track has skyrocketed.”He continued, “Historically, when presidents have been re-elected, the public’s sentiment has played a key role. While Trump is not eligible for re-election due to constitutional limits, this provides some context—42% of Americans say the country is on the right track when the incumbent party secures another term.”Enten also pointed out that just before former Vice President Kamala Harris lost to Trump and Democrats lost their Senate majority, “only about 27% to 28% of Americans felt the country was headed in the right direction.”“The bottom line is, right now, a much higher percentage of the country says we’re on the right track.” Trump's attack on traditional mediaSince returning to the White House, Trump has continued to attack traditional media outlets and the journalists they employ. In comments made to the Department of Justice earlier this month, Trump baselessly claimed that the media was producing stories designed to damage his reputation—calling it “totally illegal.”ALSO READ: Viral video: JD Vance flaunts firepower skills at Marine Corps base in Quantico, celebrates 'no more diversity trainings'“The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal and MSDNC, and the fake news, CNN and ABC, CBS and NBC, they’ll write whatever they say,” Trump said. “And what do you do to get rid of it? You convict Trump… It’s totally illegal what they do.”The President went on to claim that CNN and MSNBC write 97.6 percent negative stories about him and act as a mouthpiece for the Democrats. After criticizing most mainstream media outlets during the 2024 campaign, the president revoked long-standing office space at the Pentagon from CNN and The Washington Post, reallocating it to conservative-leaning organizations. Additionally, the president reduced the authority of the White House Correspondents’ Association and altered long-established protocols for selecting journalists to ask questions at daily briefings.On the same day Trump addressed the Department of Justice, he signed an executive order that effectively halted operations at the state-run media network, Voice of America.","summary":"Is US President Donald Trump more popular than ever?

The statement said Trump has made history “for stepping up to end the free-trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades.”\n\nThe rousing support is a marked change from previous sentiments expressed by union leaders, where only months ago Fain appeared with Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and argued that Trump’s reelection would instead lead to automotive factory closures “all over the United States.” \n\nIn addition to praising the tariff plans, the UAW called on U.S. automakers to swallow the additional costs on behalf of their shareholders, workers and customers. \n\n“After they shift their supply chains and investments to the U.S., auto companies that have enjoyed years of record profits should absorb the cost of these tariffs rather than passing them on to consumers, and the UAW would support legislative or regulatory action requiring them to do so,” the union said in the statement. “Workers must be held harmless during any disruption that accompanies the reshoring process, with financial support from the federal government if necessary.”\n\nWhile the union rank and file is politically divided, Fain’s eagerness to embrace Trump’s tariffs is not a sentiment shared by all UAW leaders.\n\nAt least three UAW leaders told the Free Press that they have concerns that Trump’s broad tariffs will cause the automakers’ costs to escalate to a point that production has to pause, which will lead to their members being laid off.\n\nTrump puts union in awkward spot\n\nMarick Masters, professor emeritus of business in the Department of Management at the Mike Ilitch School of Business at Wayne State University, said Trump’s position boils down to his campaign promise to Make America Great Again, with an emphasis on America.\n\n“Trump has succeeded at putting the union in an awkward position, where they have to support his policies but still probably detest him in other ways,” Masters said. \n\nFain had hoped to have a Democrat in the White House in 2026, when the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement was to come up for a joint review by its three member countries. The status of that free trade agreement is unclear in light of Trump's harsh tariffs.\n\n“We sure as hell don’t want Donald Trump to recommit to a deal that kills American jobs,” Fain said at an Oct. 1 rally in Detroit for Harris. “We need people like Kamala Harris at the helm who are allies with us that will demand deals that serve working-class people.”\n\nBut moving too closely to Trump's administration now may create confusion and dissent within the union. Josh Pasek, professor of communication and media and political science at the University of Michigan, said the UAW's new position isn’t nearly as dramatic as other examples of industries caving in to Trump’s administration.\n\n“What’s the real risk the UAW sees at the moment, and what are the possible benefits? One strategy is to make it look like they are on the administration’s side,” Pasek said, “It’s clear this administration will take actions with the apparent intent to harm whomever it sees as an enemy.”\n\nUAW: Thousands of U.S. workers can return quickly\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the president notified Detroit automakers to “start investing, start moving, shift production here.”\n\nThe UAW received that message optimistically, noting the devastating effects that moving jobs over the Northern and Southern borders have had on industry workers. The union’s revised stance is to focus not on politics but on the specific policy it wants to accomplish: onshoring auto jobs to the U.S.\n\nThe cost of tariffs mean thousands of jobs can return “within a matter of months, simply by adding additional shifts or lines in a number of underutilized auto plants,” the union asserted. “Right now, thousands of autoworkers are laid off at Ford, General Motors and Stellantis following recent decisions by auto executives to ship jobs to Mexico.”\n\nSingling out Stellantis, which owns the Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, Dodge and Fiat brands, the UAW said that more than 1,000 autoworkers are laid off while \"$100,000 Stellantis trucks are built in Mexico for $3 an hour.”\n\n“Our neighbors to the south — Mexican workers — aren't the enemy. They're being exploited and it's because of corporate greed, and that's what's got to stop,” Fain said.\n\nStellantis had faced criticism for rounds of job cuts last year at its U.S. facilities, and the automaker had a challenging 2024, dealing with issues ranging from lower sales to high inventories.\n\nThe layoffs, announced within the past six months, “could be undone.”\n\n“Those jobs could be brought back to Michigan immediately with well-designed auto tariffs,” the UAW said.\n\nDivided viewpoints\n\nWorried union leaders view the tariff war as a disruption to the supply chain and ultimately fear it could slow car sales. When sales drop, a recession could follow, they said, leading to economic hardship for members.\n\nSome have said they wish Fain would characterize the union’s support for tariffs as supporting strategic tariffs that create more U.S.-based manufacturing, rather than cheering for broad tariffs against North American trading partners.\n\nBut union expectations that automakers will eat tariff costs are “not particularly realistic,” according to Harley Shaiken, professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley. \n\n“You can see the anger from the union’s point of view, but it’s hardly a solution to where the industry is today and perhaps where it needs to go,” he said.\n\nFain has shown he is skilled at the bargaining table and has created a sense of inclusion among UAW members, Shaiken said, but embracing Trump on tariffs undermines that and sends a mixed message.\n\n“It sends a confused message. Many workers will say if he’s on our side here, why not vote for his successor or allies in the next election?\" Shaiken said. “That’s the danger — it gives legitimacy to Trump to create future policies that will harm workers in the future.”\n\nTrump’s Detroit stops on the campaign trail weren’t warmly welcomed by UAW leadership. Fain told the media in 2023 that “every fiber of our union is being poured into fighting the billionaire class and an economy that enriches people like Donald Trump at the expense of workers.\n\n“We can’t keep electing billionaires and millionaires that don’t have any understanding of what it is like to live paycheck to paycheck and struggle to get by and expecting them to solve the problems of the working class,” Fain said.\n\nThe UAW has formally endorsed the Democratic candidate in every presidential election since the union's formation in 1935, according to Gavin Strassel, UAW Archivist at the Walter P. Reuther Library, Archives of Labor and Urban Affairs at Wayne State University. \n\nLast October in Detroit, Trump said he wanted to renegotiate the USMCA, a renegotiation of the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement that Trump signed as president in 2019. \n\n“They are not going to plunder, rape and steal our car industry,” Trump said in the speech, where he also called Detroit a developing, “once-great city.”\n\nAt the time, Fain argued that Trump’s reelection would lead to more automotive factory closures “all over the United States.” \n\nOn the campaign trail\n\nBefore winning his first election, Trump said he planned to leverage regulation to keep jobs and wealth in America and made the claim that the surge of regulatory activity in the U.S. since 1980 shrank the present-day economy by 25%. He railed against NAFTA, which is deeply unpopular with the UAW.\n\n“Hillary Clinton has supported the trade deals stripping this city, and this country, of its jobs and wealth. She supported Bill Clinton’s NAFTA ... and she supports the Trans-Pacific Partnership,” Trump said at the Detroit Economic Club. \n\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership, or TPP, was an agreement for free trade across 12 countries — the U.S., Japan, Malaysia, Vietnam, Singapore, Brunei, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Mexico, Chile and Peru — proposed under President Barack Obama. The idea was to create stronger economic ties among the member nations, cut tariffs and foster trade to boost economic growth.\n\nTrump scored political points tying Hillary Clinton’s political views to her husband's decision to sign NAFTA. \n\nPasek's interpretation of Trump's current messaging is as a common strongman tactic, where those in leadership boast of having popular support and claim to represent the people \"against the elites.\"\n\n“The strategy is to divide different groups and put them in a position of trying to get out of harm’s way,” he said. “If unions seem inconsistent in their messaging, that sidelines any future anti-administration messaging. Are the unions focused too much on the short game or the long game?”\n\nHow to fix this\n\nAnalysts and automakers alike have been vocal about the damage tariffs of this magnitude would do to the industry. Yet short-term supply and demand constraints are nothing compared with the damage the UAW sees from 30 years of free trade.\n\n“We're in a crisis mode in this country,” Fain said Tuesday on ABC, adding the creation of NAFTA “broke” America's trade system and cost the country millions of jobs.\n\n“Tariffs are an attempt to stop the bleeding from the hemorrhaging of jobs in America for the last 33 years,” Fain said. “NAFTA sucks.”\n\nBrian Rothenberg, the UAW’s spokesman from 2014 through 2022, pointed out that the union was the first to propose added incentives to purchase U.S.-made cars, and even more incentives for union-made vehicles, under President Joe Biden’s electric vehicle program. Those proposed amendments were removed, however.\n\n“The only way to fix this is to make sure that the labor costs are equal. Until Mexican wages meet American production costs as well as other foreign countries, it will never level out,” he told the Free Press. “If you were to base the tariff on a fair level wage, there would be no incentive for those companies to go to other countries.”\n\nShaiken tends to agree, and said tariffs can be a useful tool in trade, for example, with China, where there aren't independent unions and wages are suppressed, leading to discounting abilities U.S. automakers can't match.\n\n“But tariffs as a tool can also be very destructive, and when you’re dealing with close allies in a highly integrated market across North America, you really can do a lot of damage,” he said, adding: “that isn’t to say there hasn't been considerable damage first with NAFTA and then USMCA, but Donald Trump is the one that wrote the USMCA that he’s so sharply attacking right now.”\n\nInstead of adding jobs to the U.S., added costs could push automakers to consider increasing their reliance on robots in manufacturing. Elon Musk, Tesla CEO and Trump adviser, has long espoused the benefits of adding automation to produce high volumes of vehicles.\n\n“The biggest impact on the auto industry in the past few decades is not just NAFTA but also technology,” Rothenberg said. “A stamping plant that needed 5,000 workers to operate, you can now run it with 500.”\n\nIn Fain’s view, dismantling certain areas of free trade are worth the cost of cheering Trump on.\n\n“The UAW has been clear: We will work with any politician, regardless of party, who is willing to reverse decades of working-class people going backwards in the most profitable times in our nation’s history,” Fain said. “These tariffs are a major step in the right direction for autoworkers and blue-collar communities across the country.”\n\nThis moment may mark a sea change, but one long in coming, according to Masters. \n\n“It’s been said the autoworkers are the Democratic Party in Michigan,” Masters said. “I don’t think that’s as true today as it has been.”\n\nSenior autos writer Jamie L.

During his \"Politics War Room\" podcast on Thursday, the Democratic strategist attacked Tesla CEO Elon Musk for what he believes is ruining his reputation as an innovator to work with Trump. This topic led to him calling out \"similarly situated\" billionaires like Bezos for willingly working with Trump. \"You have this tremendous economic power,\" Carville said. \"You have tremendous influence in public opinion. You own one of the legacy, important media operations, and you’re doing nothing f---ing with it.

Bezos, who also owns Amazon, has been criticized by progressives and members of his newspaper staff over the last few months for announcing changes to the Washington Post’s opinion pages. Most notably, he prevented the editorial page from endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. He also supported the Trump administration financially by donating $1 million to his inauguration fund and has even said he was optimistic about Trump’s second term.

Farmers who undertook infrastructure improvements with the guarantee of Agriculture Department reimbursement suddenly found the payments frozen. Green banks, nonprofits, local governments, and other groups who had been awarded Environmental Protection Agency grants for everything from clean energy financing to lead pipe remediation found these grants “terminated.” The administration has even accused the grantees of fraud—though so far without much evidence.This has startled people who thought you couldn’t legally cancel stuff that’s already been promised. Trump’s campaign pledge to rescind “unspent” IRA funds, it turns out, didn’t mean already committed funds were safe. Court rulings against the administration haven’t necessarily turned the taps back on. Nor, at the political level, has the IRA’s track record of benefiting red districts offered as much protection in these initial weeks as experts and advocates predicted it would; a congressional repeal effort is now underway, and while 21 House Republicans have said they oppose repealing the entirety of the act’s clean energy tax credits, their leaders show no sign of slowing their roll.But let’s say you’re not a green bank or a farmer. Let’s say you’re not one of the groups currently suing the administration for breach of contract while the administration not-so-subtly threatens to sic the FBI on you for having the audacity to apply for and receive a government grant. Let’s say you’re a homeowner whose boiler or water heater badly needs replacing, and you’re looking to defray some costs or even save on energy bills going forward. Let’s say your electrical panel is a growing fire hazard that you’ve ignored for way too long and the IRA’s provisions for panel upgrades could enable you to replace it. Do all those funds still exist? Or did you miss the window?The incentives still exist, said David Friedman, senior director for federal policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification. There are two main categories: tax credits, which get counted against your tax liability at tax time, and rebates, which can reduce up-front costs. The rebates, which the IRA stipulated had to be administered via state governments, “were a little more up in the air” for a bit, Friedman said. Only 10 states plus the District of Columbia had their programs up and running when Trump took office, and two of those paused them when the Energy Department suddenly froze the funds needed to reimburse states for the rebates. Now that the payment portal has reopened, The Washington Post recently reported, “some states, including California, New York, Maine and New Mexico, are continuing their rebate programs.” Even if you live outside one of those states, the federal tax credits never went away. “It’s going to take an act of Congress to change that,” Friedman said. And even if Congress were to repeal this particular part of the IRA, “it’s pretty rare and honestly would be pretty painful to take away a tax credit in the middle of the year.… Typically when changes are made to tax law, it’s going forward, not present or going back.” If Congress were to repeal these, they’d probably just end them ahead of schedule—maybe by a few years, he said, or maybe in 2026, rather than cutting them midyear.Tax credits don’t offer the instant affordability perks of rebates, of course. In the case of a new electrical panel or a heat pump water heater, the rebates could offer lower-income households $4,000 and $1,750, respectively, off the cost of the new devices, whereas the federal tax credit for a panel upgrade offers only 30 percent of the project cost, for a maximum of $600. Rebates “help people who can least afford the skyrocketing energy prices people are facing today,” Friedman explained. “They’re targeted at low-and moderate-income households. These are folks who are much more likely to put a Band-Aid, effectively, on their hot water heater or their heating and cooling system because they can’t afford to repair it, and that traps them in an expensive cycle. It sticks them with an outdated unit that costs more to operate and so they have higher utility bills.” In theory, the rebate programs are set to expand, because every state except for South Dakota applied to participate in the program, Friedman said. Even states that don’t yet have their programs up and running have “got contracts with the money that is legally obligated to them.”Contracts, of course, have not exactly deterred the Trump administration so far in its quest to freeze funds—despite a barrage of unfavorable judicial rulings. A growing number of advocates for these home energy incentives, though, are arguing that axing them would also be bad politics. “I think that one thing that’s become evident in the last year or so is that household energy costs—inflation, fossil fuel prices—those do seem to be more top of mind for Americans,” Energy Innovation senior director Robbie Orvis recently told Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin, in a piece about the “dollars-and-cents arguments” for keeping the IRA. Heatmap Pro’s own opinion modeling, Zeitlin noted, backed that up, showing that “lower utility bills is the number one perceived benefit of renewables in much of the country.”“A package of heat pump, water heater, heat pump heating-cooling system, and some good insulation and windows is going to save you nearly a thousand dollars a year,” Friedman said. Getting rid of the incentives that make that more affordable for people, he said, “would be a tax hike on the American public. And at a time when you’ve got a president who’s promised to cut people’s energy bills in half, it would cripple their ability to fight high energy prices.” That’s in addition to Trump’s tariff policies possibly raising utility bills all on their own.When analysts point out that IRA funds have particularly benefited red districts, they’re typically referring to money that has gone into manufacturing. But the home energy incentives could particularly benefit Republicans too. Homeowners are both more likely to lean GOP than Democrat and about twice as likely to self-identify as “strongly Republican” than renters are. Whether either the manufacturing benefits or the utility-bill benefits to their constituents convince the GOP to spare the IRA remains to be seen. After all, lots of groups lean much further right than homeowners do; that hasn’t stopped Trump from pursuing policies that wreak havoc on their bottom lines.\n\n Stat of the Week26 gigawattsThat’s how much power—“more than the total generation capacity of most U.S. states,” Inside Climate News reports—it would take to clean up the wastewater from oil operations in Texas’s Permian Basin.\n\n What I’m ReadingThe Washington Post’s Allyson Chiu profiles Palava City in India, a newish experimental community where one study found that “maximum temperature is consistently 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than in nearby cities, including Mumbai.” Low-energy cooling solutions are no small feat here, given that a lot of passive cooling strategies (like windcatchers) work better in drier climates. But buoyed by government support, high-income residents, and a more or less blank slate, developers are quickly throwing a lot of ideas on the table, Chiu reports. What they learn through trial and error, some hope, could help more traditional, cash-strapped cities:Early apartments were built with smaller windows to reduce the amount of heat that could enter, Abdullah said. But when residents complained about the window size, he said, the developers responded by constructing apartments with larger windows set farther back into the building. This design provides shade and cuts the amount of direct heat hitting the glass. More recently, Abdullah said, they’ve been experimenting with glass treatments such as films that can be applied to windows to keep heat out.On a sunny June day, the interior of a newly constructed unit with treated windows is noticeably cooler than the outdoors, even with the air conditioning shut off.But window design is just one way the community saves energy. Palava has cut residential energy use through a combination of approaches, including installing solar-powered water heaters on buildings and efficient air conditioners inside.Read Allyson Chiu’s full report at The Washington Post.This article first appeared in Life in a Warming World, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Heather Souvaine Horn.

One bemoaned America’s status as a net importer of lumber, ordering the secretary of commerce to investigate the “national security risks” of importing lumber and what would be needed for domestic production to fulfill all domestic demand. The other decried “onerous Federal policies” that have hampered the industry, directing the government to speed the approval of forestry projects on federal land and find ways to minimize the effect of the Endangered Species Act and National Environmental Policy Act.Boosting logging is controversial from several angles. But as with many industries Trump claims to champion, there’s also a second question here: Is the administration’s theory of the industry’s decline—and prescription for its revival—actually accurate?Trump’s tariffs and executive orders seem to assume that foreign competition and lack of lands to log are the primary things hampering U.S. timber production. But when I talked to experts familiar with the industry’s history, they painted a more complicated picture. There are some potential upsides to boosting domestic timber production—even on the environmental front. But the U.S. timber industry’s struggles aren’t as simple as the president seems to think, and some of his policies could even hurt the industry he claims to be helping.Access to prime logging land “[is] really not the main factor holding things back,” said Michael Snyder, the former commissioner of Vermont Forests, Parks, and Recreation, who now consults on forestry and forest policy with Greenfire Enterprises. “Sure, increased supply of raw material … would seem on the surface to be helpful, but [it’s] not if you don’t have a workforce—that includes loggers, truckers in particular; if you don’t have receiving primary processing facilities, basic sawmills, secondary manufacturing facilities, retailers, and all of those elements of any value chain in the forest economy, which are all in distress right now pretty much everywhere.” Sawmills closing has been a problem for decades, and might not be an easy trend to reverse. “In Vermont, we’ve lost 158 mills since 2000, and I think last year Oregon lost seven major mills,” said Snyder.*“There’s not one single factor that led to the decrease in both jobs as well as harvests,” said University of Oregon historian Steven Beda, who focuses on the history of the U.S. timber industry. Environmental backlash in the 1980s definitely had an effect in terms of limiting access to federal lands, he said. But also, the broader economic problems of the 1970s hit the industry hard, and over time traditional logging states like Oregon, Washington, and Idaho began to “pivot” from natural resource extraction “towards more of a high-tech economy,” said Beda, “so there’s less of an incentive for politicians to support the timber industry. Then you also have capital flight—a lot of the timber companies realizing that they can be more profitable operating in the South,” in part because of lower rates of unionization there. Both international competition and regional competition, he said, have played a role in reducing the size of the Northwest timber industry, which is the one Trump primarily seems to be targeting with his executive orders, since that’s where most of the federal forest land is located. If the goal is to resurrect the pre-1980s Northwest timber industry, Beda said, that might be tough, because “both the workforce and the sawmills kind of stabilized and readjusted to the harvest rates that took shape after the end of the spotted owl conflict,” referring to the environmental backlash and endangered species advocacy that closed off many federal lands to logging.Neither Beda nor Snyder see themselves as anti-timber. “I’m actually someone who believes that the Forest Service lands should be open to more logging,” said Beda. Snyder is a long-time advocate for people to value forestry more and take it seriously. “People realize they need plumbers and are willing to pay for it,” he said. “People don’t realize how much wood and wood products they use in their daily lives, from floors and cabinets to textiles and food additives and paper. They think we just need to leave forests alone. I don’t know where we’re going to get these materials. Plastics, concrete, and steel are far worse. So if not wood, what, and if not here, where?” But both pointed to a serious problem with the Trump administration’s approach. It “just doesn’t add up,” said Snyder, pointing to the administration’s massive cuts across the Forest Service. “We’re going to get more wood off federal land but get rid of thousands of federal employees who actually do that work? It’s absurd.”Beda agreed. “You can’t do both. You can’t cut Forest Service staff and say you want more logging on Forest Service lands. You need people to administer the contracts, put together the budgeting, all the zillion pieces that are part of public lands logging.… When you actually go back and look to the peak, the Forest Service harvests, at least in Oregon, peaked in the early 1980s, and that not coincidentally is also when the Forest Service had the largest budget and the largest staff.”Tariffs could also hurt the industry long before they help because of the cross-border nature of wood processing. As the tariffs on Canada took effect, Snyder said, he heard from loggers in Vermont that their exports to the sawmills on the Canadian border immediately cratered. “Everything from up to a 50 percent price drop to complete shutoffs of deliveries. This is coming when we’re about to head into mud season, which is a traditional time for loggers to stay out of the woods ’cause of the vulnerable soft ground,” he said.At the end of the day, “we should in my view be using more of our own wood, but these are not the buttons and levers to pull and push to get us there,” Snyder said. “It’s going to take an integrated, coherent, comprehensive approach.” He’d like to see the Endangered Species Act protected, serious money put into research on sustainable forestry, how to preserve habitats and water quality, and whether wood products could substitute for things like single-use plastics and carbon-intensive construction materials like concrete. “The way we invest in high-tech, medical, automotive—we need to have the same kind of approach to the forests of our country and the people who manage and make their living in them,” he said. But “it’s not going to happen with sweeping executive orders and tariffs like this. It’s just going to piss everybody off.”\n\n Stat of the Week66%That’s how many respondents support the U.S. transitioning to 100 percent clean energy by 2050, according to the Climate Opinion Maps that the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication recently published. (Also, 75 percent backed regulating carbon dioxide “as a pollutant” and 67 percent backed requiring fossil fuel companies to pay a carbon tax—striking numbers given that the Trump administration is moving in the exact opposite direction.)\n\n What I’m ReadingAyurella Horn-Muller and Naveena Sadasivam introduce readers to Mark Broyles, a 57-year-old living in Big Stone Gap, Virginia, where over 80 percent of residents voted for Donald Trump. Broyles’s “family of four, his mother, and her husband” have been using the food boxes provided by the nonprofit Appalachian Sustainable Development, which “helps small farmers sell fresh goods to public schools and grocery stores.” But now, due to Trump administration funding cuts, the food box program is gone. Programs benefiting both farmers and food-insecure households are folding across the country.For decades, the USDA has funded several programs that are meant to address the country’s rising food-insecurity crisis—a problem that has only worsened as climate change has advanced, the COVID-19 pandemic led to layoffs, and grocery prices have skyrocketed. A network of nonprofit food banks, pantries, and hubs around the country rely extensively on government funding, particularly through the USDA. The Appalachian Sustainable Development is but one of them. The first few months of the Trump administration have plunged the USDA and its network of funding recipients into chaos. The agency has abruptly canceled contracts with farmers and nonprofits, [frozen] funding for other long-running programs even as the courts have mandated that the Trump administration release funding, and fired thousands of employees, who were then temporarily reinstated as a result of a court order. Trump’s funding freeze and the USDA’s subsequent gutting of local food system programs has left them without a significant portion of their budgets, money they need to feed their communities. Experts say the administration’s move to axe these resources leaves the country’s first line of defense against the surging demand for hunger relief without enough supply.Read Ayurella Horn-Muller and Naveena Sadasivam’s full report at Grist.This article first appeared in Life in a Warming World, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Heather Souvaine Horn.

It’s gone from demonizing electric cars to advertising them on the White House lawn and characterizing Tesla protests as “domestic terrorism.” Most spectacularly, it’s gone from 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada and 10 percent tariffs on China to a one-month pause on tariffs on Mexico and Canada, to 25 percent tariffs on Mexico and Canada and 20 percent tariffs on China, to a one-month delay on auto tariffs, to a temporary pause on tariffs on Canada and Mexico specifically for items compliant with the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement, to a 50 percent tariff on Canadian steel and aluminum starting March 12 to … scratch that, never mind.Perhaps you find this chaotic. Perhaps you think this administration lacks ideological coherence. That’s an understandable conclusion to draw, but it’s not the whole picture.Several news stories this week suggest that the Trump administration not only has a few consistent positions but is starting to adopt a consistent communications strategy regarding those positions. One is that protest is illegal and protesters are terrorists. (These narratives have been on display both in the detention and attempted deportation of protest leader Mahmoud Khalil, and in Trump’s threat against Tesla protesters.) Another, which is now making its way into environmental and climate policy, is that extra-procedural cancellations of contractually or congressionally guaranteed payments are fine because they’re cracking down on fraud. And the common strategy in both these positions is to open with a bold assertion and, in lieu of producing evidence, escalate the assertions rapidly when challenged.Elon Musk, the “special government employee” heading the newly created, legally embattled Department of Government Efficiency, has been refining this strategy for weeks. The dominant message from DOGE, initially, was that it was cutting down on government waste and inefficiency. A few weeks into the administration, as people began to question whether Musk and some random acolytes below the age of prefrontal cortex maturity should really be getting access to sensitive data, the fraud assertions started escalating. A day after a judge challenged the fraud claims, Musk and Trump held their joint Oval Office presser, on February 11, alleging “massive amounts of fraud,” “billions of dollars of abuse, incompetence, and corruption,” “foreign fraud rings” in “entitlement programs,” 150-year-old people receiving Social Security benefits, and “tens of billions of dollars” of positively identified fraudulent payments. (You can read The Washington Post’s debunking of this, and of the White House press secretary’s subsequent effort to substantiate these claims, here.) Since then, these assertions have only grown in scale. On Monday, Musk told Fox Business’s Larry Kudlow that “entitlements” claims via fake or stolen Social Security numbers accounted for an estimated “10 percent of federal expenditures,” or “half a trillion dollars”—a staggering claim, which he then embroidered by claiming that the lure of this fast cash was a major contributor to undocumented immigration. (Half a trillion dollars, as Forbes reporter Alison Durkee pointed out, is about a third of total Social Security payments last year. Estimates from actual reports, with data, suggest less than 1 percent of Social Security claims are fraudulent. Musk’s claim that undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. to enrich themselves off Social Security is particularly bizarre, since undocumented immigrants are arguably the ones being scammed, paying into Social Security without getting anything back.)Lee Zeldin, the Trump loyalist appointed to head the Environmental Protection Agency, seems to be following Musk’s lead. On Tuesday, he announced the termination of $20 billion in grants that have already been promised to institutions via the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund program, which Congress established in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. He cited “substantial concerns regarding program integrity, objections to the award process, programmatic fraud, waste, and abuse, and misalignment with the agency’s priorities,” but provided no evidence to support such widespread fraud claims. The best he came up with was that “a group linked to Stacey Abrams received two billion dollars after reporting a mere 100 dollars in total revenue the year before” (a debunking of which you can read here) and that “the founding director of the EPA’s program dished out $5 billion to his former employer.” Pending clarity on the details, one could argue this last allegation is a conflict of interest—a weak one, given that the individual in question, Jahi Wise, doesn’t seem to have been rehired by that former employer—but not fraud, and not a conflict that can hold a candle to Musk, whose business has been built on an estimated $38 billion in government spending, being given the keys to the federal coffers and cutting subsidies to his flailing car company’s ascendant competitors. The press release also says the matter has been referred to the Office of the Inspector General and is being investigated by the Department of Justice and the FBI. In fact, a top DOJ prosecutor recently resigned after being asked to investigate EPA grants, reportedly declining to open a grand jury investigation due to insufficient evidence. The Greenhouse Gas Reduction fund has elements that conservatives should celebrate: It aimed to reduce energy bills in cash-strapped locations, and to do so while minimizing government spending (by essentially using it only as seed money for private capital). But Zeldin, implementing Musk’s narrative strategy, has now turned the program into an increasingly colorful heist story. The administration’s crusade against it can be traced to a December video by right-wing sting group Project Veritas, in which a twentysomething EPA employee in the lame-duck Biden administration said that they were trying to get grants awarded as quickly as possible: “It truly like feels we’re on the Titanic and we’re throwing gold bars off the edge.” This isn’t really evidence of anything aside from a single twentysomething having a big mouth (and the analogy falls apart as soon as you think about it for more than two seconds). But as legal challenges to its extra-procedural spending freezes mounted, the Trump administration has clung to this analogy ever more closely. In recent statements, Zeldin has even adjusted his language in a way that implies his team has “located BILLIONS of dollars’ worth” of literal gold bars that the Biden administration tried to hide at Citibank.Again: You may think this sounds chaotic. You may think that outlandish fantasies can’t be an actual comms strategy. But they are, and it’s not ineffective: The opposition can’t actually prove a negative, i.e., that fraud doesn’t exist, and if your team comes up with a wilder story each week, the press has to actually debunk it, which means they have to report that you said it, which means the claim itself is all that some people will hear or remember. Furthermore, the “fraud” story gives the Trump administration a victim to point to: you, the taxpayer. Any victim Democrats come up with therefore has to be more compelling to people than monetary self-interest.The White House may be filled with people dressed in clown costumes throwing spaghetti at a wall. But they have a story about why they’re throwing spaghetti at the wall, and they’re sticking to it—and right-wing news networks are dutifully transmitting it to voters. If Democrats want to get a different message to voters, they’re not going to get anywhere by standing next to the clowns hurling spaghetti with a sign reading, “This is not normal.” Their only option is to go find some people who’ve been smacked in the face by projectile pasta, stick those people in front of a camera, and start making the case that the Trump administration is, in fact, hurting people.\n\n Stat of the Week22%That’s how much the nation’s butterfly population has decreased in the last 20 years—a troubling indicator given insects’ foundational role in ecosystems.\n\n What I’m ReadingThe Trump administration’s broader thesis on climate change is becoming clear. Speaking at the annual oil and gas conference known as CERAWeek, Energy Secretary Chris Wright, who earned $5.6 million helming a fracking company in 2023, outlined it: Climate change is happening, but it’s the necessary price you pay for the wealth that fossil fuel companies create. (The fact that fossil fuels create more wealth specifically for Wright and the other fossil fuel executives he was speaking to than they do for many of the people poisoned by them does not seem to have been discussed.) The Guardian’s Dharna Noor reports:“The Trump administration will treat climate change for what it is, a global physical phenomenon that is a side-effect of building the modern world,” he added. “Everything in life involves trade-off.”Though he admitted fossil fuels’ greenhouse gas emissions were warming the planet, he said “there is no physical way” solar, wind and batteries could replace the “myriad” uses of gas—something top experts dispute. Further, a bigger and more immediate problem was energy poverty, Wright said.“Where is the Cop conference for this far more urgent global challenge,” he said, referring to the annual United Nations climate talks, known as the Conference of the Parties (Cop). “I look forward to working with all of you to better energize the world and fully unleash human potential.”Read Dharna Noor’s full report at The Guardian.This article first appeared in Life in a Warming World, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Heather Souvaine Horn.

Many are also hoping Trump might reopen commercial fishing in protected federal waters, as he did during his first administration. But if Trump continues on his current course, he could jeopardize some of these supporters’ livelihoods. After all, he just started a trade war with America’s two top seafood trade partners.The United States imports much more seafood than it exports—to the tune of a roughly $25 billion trade deficit, according to government data from 2022. But it does export quite a bit of its catch to Canada, serving as Canada’s top supplier for both salmon and lobster. And it exports even more to China. In fact, the Agriculture Department reported last year that seafood exports to China were actually increasing, unlike many other commodities. Both countries quickly retaliated against Trump’s tariffs on Tuesday. Canada’s two-phase tariff announcement included only a very limited list of seafood products in the first, immediate round of tariffs; almost all U.S. seafood seems to be in the firing line for a second round of tariffs scheduled for later this month. China, meanwhile, simply matched Trump’s extra 10 percent tariff increase with its own 10 percent increase, effectively immediately—seafood included.It’s possible that Trump, despite the support of New Bedford residents, may not be all that concerned about alienating voters in Maine and Massachusetts—states that account for 99 percent of Canada’s lobster imports. (He is, after all, unusually explicit in his punitive and vengeful attitude toward blue states.) But you’d think he’d be a little more concerned about Alaska, where he bested Kamala Harris by 13 points last year. Alaska is America’s top producer of Pacific salmon, and China is the top export destination for it. (China’s imports of U.S. salmon nearly tripled between 2020 and 2023, according to the USDA’s Foreign Agricultural Service.)China processes and reexports some of that salmon, which complicates things further. When Trump started a trade war with China in 2017, Alaska’s two senators and one congressman—all Republicans—lobbied the administration to exempt seafood harvested in Alaska and processed in China from the tariffs, since a lot of American seafood gets deboned in China and then returned to the U.S. These products were included anyway. The lawmakers wrote a letter expressing their displeasure. But the damage from China’s retaliation to Trump’s trade war persisted into the Biden administration, with Alaskan pollock affected as well.There are other ways Trump’s policies could wreak havoc on the industry. In theory, the tariffs could help some businesses by encouraging Americans to eat more domestic seafood, as it becomes more affordable relative to seafood impacted by the tariffs. On the other hand, it’s always a little tricky to predict how consumers are going to respond, and given the likelihood that tariffs will spike prices throughout the supply chain, it’s possible consumers will just decrease their seafood consumption. The tariffs on steel and aluminum are inevitably going to affect the cost of fishing equipment, for example. And Trump’s targeting of immigrant workers could also cause problems, given that a majority of the seafood-processing workforce is foreign-born.Then there are the cuts to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. While many in the seafood industry resent what they see as heavy-handed regulation—another fisherman told The New Bedford Light that NOAA Fisheries “is the first one that should be cut”—NOAA also provides a lot of direct and indirect support to the industry via training and grants, ecosystem restoration, and climate monitoring. This last one is a huge deal in an industry that is already being hit by climate change. (Read more in Audrey Gray’s report for TNR several years ago on global warming in the Gulf of Maine and The New York Times’ report this week on how climate change is affecting plankton and the entire oceanic ecosystem with it.) TNR’s Kate Aronoff also writes, this week, about NOAA’s monitoring program for toxic algal blooms, which is being jeopardized by DOGE cuts, potentially threatening both municipal water quality and fishing. It’s not hard to imagine that Trump’s and Elon Musk’s indiscriminate slashing of government programs will harm the fishing industry more than it helps.\n\n Stat of the Week$50 millionThat’s the estimated annual cost in the U.S. of toxic algal blooms, the monitoring and science of which is now threatened due to the Trump administration’s cuts to NOAA.\n\n What I’m ReadingThe U.S. maple syrup industry is already dealing with the upheaval of climate change, given that its business depends on “a single product harvested in a window of just a few weeks every spring,” with that window depending “on a freeze-thaw cycle.” Tariffs are now making the business harder. As a result, reports Callie Radke Stevens, some are now turning to Indigenous practices of tapping birch and other trees:A stiff tariff from the Trump administration on Canadian goods, including the equipment used to make syrup, has unsettled the industry and could drive up the price of U.S. syrup. This has coincided with a slow syrup run in February. Such short-term woes are combining with longer-term concerns, as a changing climate alters both production and the business model.So the Wheelers and other sugarmakers are expanding into other tree syrups, to fortify their businesses in the face of changing weather (political and actual) and in hopes of keeping forests healthy.

So why does he seem so hell-bent on screwing them over?Earlier this month, multiple outlets reported farmers’ complaints that promised funds—including reimbursements for improvements already paid for and installed—had been frozen, contrary to the administration’s assurances. Missouri cattle farmer Skylar Holden, in a viral video on TikTok, said that although he voted for Trump, his $240,000 contract with the Agriculture Department to improve infrastructure on his farm was now frozen, and he’d already spent $80,000 on materials and labor. The Washington Post last week “spoke with farmers and farm organizations in 10 states who had contacted their congressional delegations about the USDA funding freeze. Some farmers from conservative-leaning districts said they have received no reply. Others said they were told that their representatives supported the administration’s decision—and some representatives appeared to suggest that Trump’s funding freeze was not affecting farmers at all.” These kinds of stories are now proliferating in local news outlets in rural states, whose residents are also being hit by USDA firings.And this week, the Post revealed a new detail: After a federal judge blocked the freeze on January 28, middle managers at the Department of Agriculture asked superiors whether they could release these funds—and were told they could not. But supposedly, this is getting resolved: Newly confirmed Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins recently claimed to have “release[d] the first tranche of funding that was paused due to the review of funding in the Inflation Reduction Act” and promised that the department would “honor contracts that were already made directly to farmers.”You’ll notice some caveats in there: “already made” and “directly to farmers.” It’s unclear whether this money will be enough, or be disbursed soon enough, for some of the farms in question, NBC’s Suzy Khimm reported Saturday. First, the IRA funds aren’t the only funds that have been frozen. Second, small farms operating on tight profit margins “make up a large proportion of the farms participating in some of the federal grant programs” in question. And third, farming isn’t something that can be put on hold: As March draws near, many farms are heading into thawing, planting, and animal birthing season. This, on its own, would be cause for concern in an agricultural system that already operates with worryingly few redundancies—especially since American agriculture is also heavily dependent on immigrant workers, whom the Trump administration is also targeting. But it’s not the only crisis at USDA right now. Only days after Rollins was sworn in, the department accidentally fired people working on the government’s response to the H5N1 avian flu and had to set about trying to rehire them. While Trump said Friday that Rollins is “going to do something with the eggs” (by which he apparently meant lower egg prices), this is hardly a good start. NPR recently profiled two other workers fired at USDA, both of whom worked on securing the food system in the face of escalating threats from pests, pathogens, and climate shocks. This is consistent with recent New York Times reporting that some 400 people in the USDA’s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service have been fired, along with an estimated 800 agricultural scientists. The USDA apparently did not answer Times reporters’ questions about how many employees had been fired overall, but current estimates are that around 4,200 probationary USDA employees alone have been laid off. Many experts already consider U.S. agriculture to be underprepared for the pathogens, pesticide resistance, weather pattern shifts, and other threats that are predicted to become more common. On Monday, a coalition of environmental groups and the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York sued the USDA for “unlawfully removing department webpages focused on climate change,” which help farmers “make the best choices and access resources to mitigate harm to their livelihoods,” according to the press release. Whether Rollins is the best person to sort through this mess is another question. As Mike Lavender, policy director at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, told journalist Tom Philpott on a recent podcast, the USDA is a large department, which means a core component of the job is “managing a huge number of people.” But aside from growing up on a farm, Rollins’s primary qualification for this role seems to have been her time leading the America First Policy Institute, “which was a relatively small think-tank organization that didn’t focus a ton on agriculture,” Lavender said. “So when you start parsing through her record, looking for the substantive linkages to domestic agricultural policy, there’s not a ton there to go on, and there’s not a lot of record of experience in managing huge businesses, organizations with a lot of employees, which is a significant part of the USDA role.”One of the fired USDA employees NPR profiled was a veteran who’d served in the Air Force for 20 years and was training dogs to detect contraband agricultural products so that potential pathogens and pests can be kept out of the U.S. “I gave blood, sweat, and tears to this country for 20 years to continue service to the federal government,” he told NPR. “I kind of feel like I was just thrown out like a piece of trash.”\n\n Stat of the Week$5 billionThat’s how much BP now plans to cut from its low-carbon investment plan, instead increasing its oil and gas production targets by 60 percent.\n\n What I’m ReadingLast week, this newsletter mentioned some of the upward pressures on coffee prices right now, including the crop’s particular vulnerability to climate change and weather shocks. The Times recently published a wonderfully in-depth feature on this topic, covering not just the market quirks that make this industry particularly tricky but also farmers’ efforts to shift to new coffee varieties and farming techniques that may make them more resilient. Don’t miss the more hopeful story of one farmer in Corquín, Honduras:An agricultural engineer by training, Mr. Romero began studying how to shelter his own crop from the elements. He proposed adding a canopy of taller trees like pine and mahogany to cast shade over his coffee. That would keep moisture in the soil and preserve the health of the roots, allowing them to take up more water and nutrients. He made plans to intersperse fruit trees—mangoes, oranges, lemons and plantains—diversifying his harvest while adding additional roots to preserve soil.In 2009, Mr. Romero persuaded his wife, his parents and his brother to pool their land holdings, turning their 140 acres into a collective plantation that would pursue this new mode of operation, with sustainability as their lodestar.He organized two dozen other farms into a cooperative called Cafico. Members could share techniques and operate a nursery to produce suitable varieties of coffee plants and shade trees. They financed the construction of a mill to dry and process their harvest and sell the crop. They eschewed chemical fertilizers and pesticides, dedicating themselves to organic production.His pitch encountered initial resistance from potential members, given the arithmetic.… “Everyone said we were crazy,” said Mr. Romero, 45. “Now, they are copying the model.”Read Peter S.

Egg prices alone jumped 15.2 percent from December. But coffee and other items have also grown more expensive.As numerous pieces were quick to point out, this is not a great look for President Donald Trump, who campaigned on the promise of lowering costs for consumers on “day one,” and who has also promised lower interest rates, which the Fed is unlikely to deliver unless inflation is under control. Trump reacted to the inflation news by blaming his predecessor. “BIDEN INFLATION UP!” he posted on Truth Social. At least one survey already suggests consumers aren’t buying this line: The University of Michigan’s February survey of consumers found they expect inflation to increase, particularly in light of the tariffs Trump has slapped on top trading partners. Nor are economists overly impressed by Elon Musk’s proposal to tackle the problem: dramatically slashing government spending. Even if Musk could cut spending as much as he suggests (doubtful, reports The Economist, which finds much evidence of chaos but not much movement in actual numbers) experts say the result would crash the economy. But the whom-to-blame discourse threatens to obscure a broader truth about food prices in particular right now: These price increases aren’t random. While inflation overall is a complicated topic, to put it mildly, many of these individual price increases have clear causes and were accurately predicted not just months, but years in advance. And Team Trump, even without their sudden enthusiasm for tariffs, would be poorly suited to tackle these particular price hikes. That’s because the dominant conservative model for fighting high cost of living—removing regulations and cutting government spending—isn’t very well suited to the crises driving some of these increases.As Jan Dutkiewicz wrote at The New Republic last month, egg price increases are being driven partly by the H5N1 avian flu outbreak—which is being exacerbated by longstanding underregulation of animal agriculture. “Virtually all of the 100-or-so billion eggs produced annually in the United States come from factory farms,” and “cramming so many virtually genetically identical birds of the same breed into such tight quarters makes factory farms hotbeds of disease,” Jan wrote. “For decades, public health experts have feared that the next big pandemic would originate in poultry.… Reducing the risk of zoonotic outbreaks in the food system, mostly by reducing land clearing for crops and moving away from the factory farming of animals, is a lesson we should have learned from previous avian flu outbreaks and from the 2009 swine flu outbreak. And it should have been driven home by the scope and scale of the human and economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic.”Paradoxically, he continued, the historical cheapness of eggs has fed a national egg-eating habit that now gives egg prices disproportionate sway over our overall experience of inflation:[I]f consumers eat a lot of eggs, the price of eggs will be weighted heavily in calculating the [Consumer Price Index]. As the Brookings Institute put it, in an article written before the current outbreak of H5N1, “Americans spend more on chicken than tofu, so changes in the price of chicken have a greater impact on the CPI.” In the face of a supply shock like H5N1, egg prices rise much faster than those of other goods, which not only drives up CPI but makes the difference in prices very obviously visible to shoppers, even though most of them don’t connect the price hikes to a disease ravaging farms thousands of miles away from their supermarket.Cheap eggs might just be a bad long-term goal to aim for, Jan argued. And whether or not you agree with that conclusion, cheap eggs seem like a difficult outcome for the Trump team to deliver merely by slashing spending and regulations. They could, of course, simply stop doing anything about the avian flu: no more testing, and thus no more culling of diseased chicken flocks or federal compensation for those culls. This “let the world burn” strategy is not impossible to imagine of Trump—but it’s hard to see how this would accomplish the putative goal, given that sick birds typically stop laying eggs.The Trump administration’s economic approach also seems suboptimally calibrated for dealing with the kind of price volatility we’re starting to see with coffee. In January, Arabica coffee futures spiked to record levels amid tariff fears, The Wall Street Journal reported—but that wasn’t the only reason for the volatility. Severe drought in Brazil and wild swings in precipitation in Vietnam—the world’s two top coffee-producing countries—had already lowered yields. This is consistent with what researchers have long predicted might happen as climate change accelerates. In fact, last March, researchers with the European Central Bank calculated that “weather and climate shocks” alone may drive food price increases of 1.5–1.8 percentage points a year within a decade, and increases of 2.2–4.3 percentage points a year by 2060.Coffee has long been identified, along with chocolate, as a crop particularly sensitive to these weather changes. In fact, chocolate prices are also way up for weather reasons, leading to multiple stories last week (and a data-heavy report from Climate Central) explaining the context to Valentine’s Day shoppers.Deregulation and cutting all funds geared at addressing climate change isn’t going to help this problem. “Drill, baby, drill,” the slogan Trump adopted for his inauguration, has long been the Republican rallying cry for economic growth and low cost of living. But Democrats have tried this approach, too, and it’s not even very effective at lowering gas prices—much less the prices of things that get harder to produce the more fossil fuels you burn.There are, of course, efforts to diversify coffee strains and make the global coffee market more resilient to climate shocks. One of the bodies funding those efforts was the U.S. Agency for International Development, which the Trump administration is now dismantling.\n\n Stat of the Week$19 billionThat’s how much money—intended for states, municipalities, and nonprofits—remained frozen in EPA coffers as of the end of last week, despite court orders for the Trump administration to resume disbursements, according to Inside Climate News. \n\n What I’m ReadingLast spring, Liza Featherstone wrote at TNR about Vermont’s new law, following the federal “Superfund” model for chemical cleanups, that aims to make fossil fuel companies pay into a fund that can then be used to offset the costs of climate disasters. This model of climate policy, The Guardian’s Dharna Noor reports, is now spreading rapidly, although courtroom challenges from the fossil fuel industry are spreading almost as quickly:“I think Trump’s election has turbocharged the ‘make polluters pay’ movement,” said [Jamie] Henn, who has been a leader in the campaign for a decade.… The state of Vermont in May passed a first-of-its-kind law holding fossil fuel firms financially responsible for climate damages and New York passed a similar measure in December.… Similar bills are being considered in Maryland, New Jersey, Massachusetts and now Rhode Island, where a measure was introduced last week. A policy will also soon be introduced in California, where recent deadly wildfires have revived the call for the proposal after one was weighed last year.Minnesota and Oregon lawmakers are also considering introducing climate superfund acts. And since inauguration day, activists and officials in a dozen other states have expressed interest in doing the same, said Henn.“I think people are really latching on to this message and this approach right now,” Henn said. “It finally gives people a way to respond to climate disasters, and it’s something that we can do without the federal government.”Read Dharna Noor’s full report at The Guardian.This article first appeared in Life in a Warming World, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Heather Souvaine Horn.

The United to End Polluter Handouts coalition—which among its over 30 members includes the youth-focused Sunrise Movement, NextGen America, and Zero Hour; senior-focused Third Act; consumer rights nonprofit Public Citizen; and social justice grassroots organization Hip Hop Caucus—is embracing a particular strategy, organizers on the call explained: to target the budget reconciliation process in March with a demand to end fossil fuel subsidies. The goal, organizers say, is not just to strike a blow against the oil and gas industry. It’s also to hit oil executives in a way that undermines Trump’s entire platform.The reconciliation process needed to pass the tax bill, Pica argued, is where the rubber of the Trump administration meets the road. “They want to pass this tax cut bill so they have to cut other types of social spending. They want to increase defense at the cost of SNAP, increase oil and gas subsidies at the expense of Medicaid. This is their big plan,” he said. “It’s their plan because they don’t have the votes in the Senate to pass anything other than a tax bill.” So that’s where environmental and other progressive groups “can pick a fight,” he said. “And if we don’t win, we will use this moment to gum up the reconciliation package.” A significant part of the task, he and others on the call agreed, would be forcing Democrats to “hold the line.”That’s easier said than done. As several people on the call acknowledged, politicians typically look for deals in these sorts of negotiations. Democrats so far have not indicated much willingness to fight via all available means. And at the end of the day, the GOP does have the votes to push a reconciliation package through, with or without Democratic cooperation.But the groups on the call Monday aren’t the only ones unveiling new strategies in the coming weeks. The Center for Biological Diversity, for example, launched 266 lawsuits against environmental rollbacks under the last Trump administration alongside other environmental groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council—winning a striking majority of them. “Because [Trump and Elon Musk] have moved with such speed it has taken a little bit of time for us to catch up,” Center for Biological Diversity Government Affairs Director Brett Hartl told me by phone. “But I think we expect to have at least one or two more lawsuits against DOGE,” he said, in addition to those already filed by such groups as Democratic attorneys general, “and I think there’ll be other lawsuits challenging aspects of some of the executive orders in the next, I would say one to three weeks.”Despite the widely reported absence of “the resistance” this time around, these groups emphasize that they haven’t gone anywhere. And there’s another common theme: While the opposition is at a significant disadvantage given Democratic minorities in the House and Senate, the dizzying pace of the administration’s opening weeks, they argue, masks vulnerability—which Trump’s opponents can exploit.“President Trump and the Republicans are weak,” Pica said Monday, pointing to the thin GOP majority dictating a need to pass legislation via the budget reconciliation process. “This is an opportunity to lay out and expose Trump for who he really is,” Sunrise Movement Executive Director Aru Shiney-Ajay said. “The reason he has such a high approval rating is that he was able to fool people into thinking that he fought for everyday people.” Attacking his “oligarch” allies, she and others on the call argued, undermines his core appeal to certain voters.Environmental advocate Bill McKibben recently proposed a similar approach in his newsletter The Crucial Years. “Our job is not to stop what Trump is doing, because we can’t,” he wrote to fellow activists. “Our basic job is to make what he’s doing is deeply unpopular, because that will stiffen the backbone of the courts and any remaining moderate Republicans, and set us up for possible gains if and when we next have elections. So: witness, communicate, ridicule, amplify strong voices.”And if the would-be activists reading that newsletter are still sitting stunned on their sofas, uncertain what to do with the barrage of news over the last few weeks? When I asked Hartl what he would say to environmentally concerned readers who might be feeling more overwhelmed than empowered at present, he pointed to the need to distinguish substance from show.“Make sure that elected officials and your representatives and people know when [Trump’s] actions are causing real harm, as opposed to the noise and chaos that he is so good at generating all the time,” he said. “That is his one true superpower, is flooding the news with nonsensical chaos.” While many of the spectacular Week One executive orders on environmental matters were ultimately symbolic requests for agencies to produce reports, (which is part of why groups were slow to sue, Hartl explained) halting Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, disbursements is another matter. “People are going to lose their jobs, because the money’s not going to be there so they’re not going to be able to do the work they were promised to do,” he said. Like many in the past week, Hartl questioned whether Trump actually has the political support for these sorts of moves. “He promised to have the cleanest air and cleanest water in the world. He told everyone RFK Jr. was going to fix our broken food systems and get chemicals out of the environment. He didn’t run a campaign on utterly destroying the environment and killing people’s jobs,” Hartl said. “So folks need to bring all that to light, because they’re deeply unpopular. And his one vulnerability is that he is actually incredibly thin-skinned and sensitive to public opinion. The only thing that really makes him change his mind is when things are going bad—and then he’ll just change on a whim cause he doesn’t really have any principles.”\n\n Stat of the Week60% to 80% chanceThat’s how likely it is that the target set by the Paris climate agreement—limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial temperatures—has already been crossed, according to a new study.

Read CNN’s report on this study and two other grim ones here.The Washington Post paints a portrait of utter chaos following the president’s Day One order to halt disbursements from the IRA. While the White House “repeatedly said the freeze of agriculture funding and other federal financial assistance would not affect benefits that go directly to individuals, such as farmers,” the Post reports that farmers were still unable to access funds—including reimbursements for projects already completed—as of last weekend.[Last] Wednesday, National Farmers Union President Rob Larew testified before the Senate Agriculture Committee that the Trump administration’s sweeping decisions on federal funding were creating concern for farmers across the country.“No one knows what funding will be available or if key programs will have the staff needed to operate,” Larew said. “Freezing spending and making sweeping decisions without congressional oversight just adds more uncertainty to an already tough farm economy.”Skylar Holden, a cattle farmer in eastern Missouri, said he signed a $240,000 contract in December under the Environmental Quality Incentives Program to share costs on investments for his farm.With the funding, Holden erected new fencing and installed a well. He had planned further improvements to his farm’s water system and spent $80,000 on materials and labor contracts that he expected would be partly paid back by the government.This month, a USDA representative told him the funding was paused because of Trump’s executive order.Read the full report from Daniel Wu, Gaya Gupta, and Anumita Kaur here.This article first appeared in Life in a Warming World, a weekly TNR newsletter authored by deputy editor Heather Souvaine Horn.

Here’s a brief rundown of where things stand on the environmental front, two weeks into Donald Trump’s second term—and a few themes that might not be apparent from the daily headline deluge. (The typical Trump-era caveat applies: This list may be outdated by the time you read it, given the rapid pace of executive actions so far, and it’s not intended to be exhaustive.)Within hours of his inauguration, Trump signed an executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy,” a roughly 3,500-word document ordering all agencies to review, identify, and begin the suspension or reversal of any policies “that impose an undue burden on the identification, development, or use of domestic energy resources—with particular attention to oil, natural gas, coal, hydropower, biofuels, critical mineral, and nuclear energy resources,” or that somehow restrict “consumer choice of vehicles and appliances.” The order also revoked a number of Biden-era executive orders to do with clean energy, climate change adaptation, and the establishment of a national Climate Corps; ordered the agencies to take steps to expedite the federal permitting process; barred agencies from using “methodologies that are arbitrary or ideologically motivated” in their environmental analyses (specifically singling out the concept of the “social cost of carbon”); and ordered all agencies to “immediately pause the disbursement of funds appropriated through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 … or the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act,” with electric vehicle programs specifically put in the crosshairs. It also outlined protocol for fast-tracking the approval of liquefied natural gas ports and instructed agencies to remove any “undue burdens” on the mineral mining industry and prioritize actions to facilitate mineral extraction.In the same flurry of week one orders, Trump declared a “national energy emergency,” ordering agencies to use emergency authorities to speed oil and gas production (but not solar and wind power). A separate order singled out Alaska’s reserves in particular for exploitation. Trump withdrew the country from the Paris climate accord and Joe Biden’s U.S. International Climate Finance Plan, ordered agencies to rethink water distribution in Southern California (which the federal government doesn’t really control), and ordered a performance review for the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA. He also ordered a blanket pause on federal grant money, which would affect a number of environmental and clean energy programs—although this order was then rescinded and also paused by multiple federal judges.On January 29, the Senate confirmed Trump’s nominee for the Environmental Protection Agency head, Lee Zeldin—a noted Trump loyalist. Trump also appointed David Fotouhi (another Trump EPA veteran, who recently as a litigator challenged the EPA’s asbestos ban) as second in command, tapped chemical industry insiders Nancy Beck and Lynn Dekleva to lead the EPA’s chemical regulation, and named two former oil lobbyists—Alex Dominguez and Aaron Szabo—to manage auto emissions and air pollution for the agency. Meanwhile, newly confirmed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy instructed the Department of Transportation to preferentially fund projects serving areas with higher marriage and birth rates, and began the process of reversing Biden policies on fuel efficiency standards.This week opened with the administration reminding all recently hired EPA workers via email that “as a probationary/trial period employee,” they could be fired immediately—an EPA-specific escalation from the prior week’s general threats and buyouts offered to all federal workers via the extrajudicial powers of Elon Musk. The White House also announced the nomination of Neil Jacobs, known for altering a map of the projected path of Hurricane Dorian with a Sharpie during Trump’s first administration, in an attempt to corroborate the president’s misleading tweet, to head the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The Senate confirmed Trump’s nominee, the fracking executive Chris Wright, to lead the Department of Energy. On Tuesday, The New York Times reported that the EPA would also be “demoting career employees who oversee scientific research, the enforcement of pollution laws, hazardous waste cleanup and the agency’s human resources department and will replace them with political appointees.” So what does this add up to? And how does it fit into the much larger flurry of executive actions on foreign aid, immigration, public health, LGBTQ rights, and more in the past two weeks?First, while some aspects of Trump’s first two weeks (such as the speed and scale of some of the assaults on the federal workforce, the attacks on USAID in particular, handing over the federal payment system to Musk and his teenage staff) have surprised even watc","summary":"The Trump administration has disrupted quite a few money flows in its first two months, reserving special effort and scorn for those authorized by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.

And that journalist, Atlantic editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, has found himself facing blistering attacks from Trump's orbit, including from the president himself, over his past reporting and accusations he's a partisan actor in a strange media story that's nevertheless unfolded on familiar lines. Goldberg set off a firestorm on Monday when he first published a story about being inadvertently included on a Signal chat by National Security Advisor Michael Waltz about plans to attack the Houthis. The chat included Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, CIA Director John Ratcliffe and several other high-ranking figures. Publishing his story and accusing the Trump administration of an embarrassing security breach did not win him friends in high places. Goldberg has been a high-profile media figure for decades, and he was a go-to interviewer for President Barack Obama during his administration to discuss foreign policy. TRUMP ADMIN DECLARES THE ATLANTIC'S SIGNAL ARTICLE A 'HOAX' AFTER IT DROPS 'WAR PLANS' RHETORIC Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt said this week there was \"arguably no one in the media who loves manufacturing and pushing hoaxes more than Jeffrey Goldberg,\" called him an \"anti-Trump hater,\" and accused him of pushing a fake story about President Donald Trump disparaging military members as \"losers and suckers,\" among other rejoinders. Trump has hotly contested The Atlantic's claim that he disparaged deceased veterans in that fashion in a story released in the heat of the 2020 election. \"I happen to know the guy is a total sleazebag,\" Trump said this week of Goldberg. \"The Atlantic is a failed magazine, does very, very poorly. Nobody gives a damn about it.\" In another interview this week, Trump said, \"He’s a sleazebag at the highest level. His magazine is failing. It’s going to be out of business soon, in my opinion.\" Under Goldberg's leadership, The Atlantic endorsed Hillary Clinton for president in 2016, Joe Biden in 2020, and Kamala Harris in 2024, only the third, fourth, and fifth presidential endorsements in the magazine's history. The magazine has printed heterodox views on a number of topics over the years, but its official position toward Trump is hostile, calling him \"one of the most personally malignant and politically dangerous\" candidates in history. VETERAN DEM SENATOR DEMANDS HEGSETH RESIGN OVER SIGNAL CHAT LEAK Top Trump officials involved in the story have also gone after Goldberg. Waltz called Goldberg a \"loser\" at one point while discussing the leak, for which he said he's taken full responsibility. Hegseth said Goldberg was \"a deceitful and highly discredited so-called journalist who’s made a profession of peddling hoaxes time and time again\" who also \"peddles in garbage.\" He also said no war plans or classified information was disseminated on the chat. Goldberg, after initially withholding some of what he characterized as overly sensitive material shared in the thread, published the rest of what he called the Trump team's \"attack plans\" for Yemen on Wednesday. Vice President JD Vance said Goldberg \"oversold\" his material. \"There is a clear public interest in disclosing the sort of information that Trump advisers included in nonsecure communications channels, especially because senior administration figures are attempting to downplay the significance of the messages that were shared,\" wrote Goldberg and reporter Shane Harris. The Trump team's harsh words for Goldberg is certainly no surprise given the mutual antagonism between the administration and much of the media, but whether the familiar playbook has been effective in neutralizing the story is another matter. ATLANTIC REPORTER PUBLISHES MORE TEXTS ABOUT ATTACK ON HOUTHI TARGETS \"It's outrageous that anyone would attack him,\" one former Atlantic employee told Fox News Digital. \"I think to the public, to leading Dems and Republicans, the evasions, the ‘lies’ about what this group was [doing] and what was being sent are obvious – and the impulse to kick Goldberg just looks nasty, and unbecoming of leaders. It seems petty and small.\" Another media writer said Trump has proven attacking the media is an effective strategy, although they added that Trump's treatment of journalists \"goes far beyond typical hostility towards the press.\" \"The overzealous response from many in the media to his presidency ended up fueling the public’s worst suspicions about the media and its biases,\" they told Fox News Digital. \"For those reasons, I don’t think this is a losing strategy from the White House. The combination of Trump’s attacks on the press and the decentralization of information means that Americans no longer share a common reality.\" \"All Americans should want a media that isn’t scared to challenge the U.S. government. We’re in dangerous territory when a free press feels pressure to avoid treating the most powerful political body in the world with scrutiny,\" they added. The White House has said The Atlantic backpedaled off its initial claim that the Trump team had shared \"war plans,\" and officials have consistently touted that regardless of the chat fiasco, the operation against the Houthi terrorists was a huge success. That hasn't stopped Democrats and Trump administration critics from calling for Waltz and Hegseth to resign and investigations into what they call an illegal security breach that could have endangered American service members. The Atlantic released a sharp statement on Wednesday in response to the war of words from Trump. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Attempts to disparage and discredit The Atlantic, our editor, and our reporting follows an obvious playbook by elected officials and others in power who are hostile to journalists and the First Amendment rights of all Americans,\" a spokesperson said. Reached for additional comment, a spokesperson told Fox News Digital, \"The Trump administration is trying to move attention away from what its officials did by focusing on semantics and attacks on The Atlantic. We reported what happened. We have now published the Signal messages for everyone to read. This national-security breach is what the Trump administration needs to answer for.\"","summary":"President Donald Trump and top officials have been fiercely critical of The Atlantic&apos;s Jeffrey Goldberg after his reporting on a Signal chat he was inadvertently included on.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/atlantic-journalist-center-leak-story-faces-fury-from-trump-top-officials","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/03/931/523/trump-goldberg.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 09:00:54","author":"David Rutz","authors":["David Rutz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":305084180,"title":"STEVE HILTON: Gavin Newsom leaves an unexpected legacy in California","text":"Everywhere I go in America, when I tell people I’m from California I get one of two reactions: \"You need to get out of there -- move to somewhere less crazy!\" Or: \"Why do they keep voting for that (fill in your curse word of choice…)?\" MASSIVE RV PARKING LOT IN CALIFORNIA CITY TAKEN OVER BY HOMELESS SQUATTERS Well, here’s the good news: the answers to those two questions are now coming together in a beautiful and positive prospect: real political change in the Golden State. My answer to the first question is typically: \"Why should we leave? This is my home! I’m raising my family here; I started a business here. Yes, our terrible government has turned everything into a disaster right now, but I love California. It’s not us who should leave, but the people who did this to our state!

They pulled it off, taking control 4-3 in the midterm elections in 2022. They went on to implement common-sense conservative policies on crime, homelessness, and what’s taught in schools. They even introduced and passed a local ballot initiative on voter ID. Guess what? In last November’s elections, they pulled off a stunning clean sweep. The \"MAGAnificent Seven\", as they called themselves, won every seat. Huntington Beach went from 6-1 Democrat control to 7-0 Republican. There were other signs in 2024 that a political revolution may be brewing. Nearly a fifth of California’s counties (10 out of 58) flipped from blue to red in 2024 including Fresno, the state’s fifth largest city. BELOVED LA RESTAURANT HIT WITH SOCIAL MEDIA BACKLASH AFTER OWNERS SPOKE POSITIVELY ABOUT TESLA Proposition 36 (which reversed some of the worst parts of former Vice President and California Attorney General Kamala Harris’ disastrous pro-crime Prop 47 from a few years earlier) passed with over 70% support. Soros-backed DAs like George Gascon in L.A. were kicked out. Ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage, impose rent control and raise taxes were defeated. And of course, President Donald Trump did better in California than any Republican presidential candidate for decades. Republican voter registration has also been increasing while Democrat registration has been falling. And all of this was happening before the catastrophic Los Angeles wildfires, which showed so many people the terrible consequences of what I call the new DEI: Democrat Extremism and Incompetence. It is Gov. Gavin Newsom who has presided over all this. He’s the one that enabled years of far-left insanity that gave California the highest poverty rate in America, the most expensive housing, gas, electricity and water, the highest unemployment, lowest income growth and worst business climate. The public schools are a disaster, homelessness continues to spiral out of control, the California Dream is out of reach and the fire hydrants are out of water. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION On Newsom’s watch, California has gone from being America’s crown jewel to its worst-run state. No fair-minded person could come to any other conclusion. It’s all laid out in my new book Califailure, along with the accompanying Fox Nation special. You should read the book: it’s a warning not to let this happen in your state. It shows exactly how the Democrats did it -- and how to stop it. But the second part of my book is called Califuture. In it, I lay out a positive, practical plan for turning things around. Commonsense policies that will stop the insane government bloat and nanny state bossiness that is making life a misery for every small business and every family. Of course, it will only happen if we actually end the Democrats’ disastrous one-party rule and elect Republicans to statewide office, like we used to before government unions and far left activists got their stranglehold on power.

The exact number of affected employees in that round of cuts is unknown but at least 17 were reporters.\n\nAnd as TheWrap exclusively reported, this included 23-year veteran senior writer Jeffrey Fleishman, staff writer Tracy Wilkinson and national and foreign editor Alan Zarembo, who were the first confirmed staffers to take the buyout.\n\nAt the time of those buyouts, an employee who was still at the the Times told TheWrap that six veteran copyeditors were also among those taking a buyout. This employee had particularly harsh criticism of Soon-Shiong, saying in part, “that’s a tremendous amount of institutional knowledge lost. Perhaps we should put out a missing flyer in search of the man who bought our paper and made promises about its future.”\n\nIn January 2024, following the resignation of executive editor Kevin Merida, the Times laid off 115 journalists, with more editors resigning in the following months.\n\nBut the latest cuts also follow what critics charge is Soon-Shiong imposing a decidedly right wing tilt on the paper that began when he axed the paper’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris for president. \n\nEditorial Editor Mariel Garza resigned in protest over that decision, and as TheWrap reported at that time, editorial writer Karin Klein and Pulitzer Prize winner Robert Greene both quit the day after.","summary":"The latest cuts come a month after at least 40 newsroom employees accepted buyouts\n\n\nThe post LA Times Hit by More Layoffs as Dozens Cut From Operations, Communications Divisions | Report appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/la-times-dozens-of-layoffs-business-divisions/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/LATimes.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 05:54:24","author":"Ross A.

And it creates a better politics","text":"The budget lock-up is sacred political territory. Journalists sweat over hundreds of pages in an internet-free chamber, carefully crafting the stories that will set the nation’s agenda for months to come. But this year, something was different: 13 influencers walked through the doors and sent metaphorical papers flying through the corridors of Parliament House. \n\nIf you’re over 40 you might be alarmed, shocked and horrified at these non-journalist types being granted access to the government’s day of days. If you’re under 40, it’s safe to assume your heart rate is under control and you understand exactly why the Albanese government is changing its approach to the media ahead of the May 3 federal election. Things aren’t just changing, they’ve already changed — but many of us are still catching up. \n\nThere’s a Black Mirror feeling to the news of late, in large part thanks to the publicity machine of President Donald Trump. His AI-generated vision of Gaza as Vegas-meets-Monaco is just one in a slew of announcements shared on social media from the most online president in history. In the two and a half months following his reelection, Trump was mentioned approximately 236 million times on social media platforms, averaging 3.3 million mentions per day.\n\nRegardless of your feelings towards Trump — and this column could not fit mine — you can’t dispute the efficacy of his digital domination. The special ingredient? Engaging with new media. Throughout his election campaign, Trump homed in on young men by collaborating with content creators, streaming on Twitch and Kick, and making podcast appearances, including on three of the top five Spotify podcasts. \n\nThe podcast strategy alone proved to be a major win, with research showing it boosted his support by between 1-2.6%. His chat on Joe Rogan’s vodcast was the driving factor in this, receiving 57 million views on YouTube. Oh, and he won men under 30 by a 14-point margin — young men being the largest cohort of Rogan’s listeners. \n\nFar from old school, Kamala Harris enlisted a “digital rapid response” unit of gen Z-ers, a far-reaching creator program, a strong podcasting strategy and an ever bigger digital media spend — but to lesser effect. Trump’s collaboration with new media was more widespread and, teamed with targeted messaging and digital advertising spend, proved to be a winning combination. \n\nWith these results, it’s no wonder the White House has opened up press briefings to new media representatives. \n\nThis is no anomaly — a number of far-right parties have seen success with the strategy. In 2024, France’s National Rally secured 28% of votes from under-35s thanks in part to creators who mixed fashion and music with anti-immigration policies, while Germany’s AfD doubled their vote share to 20.8% with the help of TikTok and AI-generated influencer “Larissa”. \n\nThe same playbook has been alive and well for a while now: NZ-born agency Topham Guerin leveraged video and creators for Christopher Luxon in New Zealand, Boris Johnson in the UK and Scott Morrison in his prime. It’s just that in 2025, it’s so much more powerful — and Australia is starting to catch on.\n\nDuring the Voice to Parliament referendum, the No-pushing Fair Australia account (owned by Advance Australia) received nearly 2.6 million likes on TikTok, more than eight times the Uluru Statement and Yes23 accounts combined. That wasn’t just thanks to the platform or the algorithm; Advance Australia used a swathe of real voices, and played the strategy on repeat. That combination of diverse but interconnected narratives, volume, real voices and influencers blew the Yes campaign out of the water.\n\nIn the past few months, we’ve seen the leaders of both major parties frequent podcasts of all different flavours. From Mark Bouris’ Straight Talk and The Squiz’s News Club to Abbie Chatfield’s It’s A Lot, Hannah Ferguson’s Big Small Talk and Olympian Sam Fricker’s Diving Deep, it appears they’ve cottoned on to the power of finding voters where they actually are. This week in Parliament, Albo even used the sentence “they’re delulu with no solulu” after he learned the slang on Happy Hour with Lucy and Nikki. \n\nAnd with gen Z and millennials making up 70% of podcast listeners — the same cohort that will overtake baby boomers as the dominant voting bloc this election — politicians need to tune in. \n\nThe Greens and independents are wise to it, too — and have been since the 2022 election. During the last federal race, a combination of meme culture, community engagement and creator outreach saw massive organic impact, mobilising young, disengaged voters with campaigns like It Takes 3 (Climate 200). The strategy is one that will only ramp up this campaign season. \n\nYet despite all of this, inviting 13 creators to the holiest day on the political calendar really seemed to ruffle the feathers of traditional media and the political elite. Coalition Senator Andrew Bragg described Tuesday’s influencer inclusion as “cash for comment”, while the AFR boldly labelled the content creators as “self-obsessed and self-promoting gen Z and millennial influencers” who will “regurgitate the government’s messages directly into the phone screens of hundreds of thousands of young people”. I’d quickly point out that gen Z and millennials themselves feel exactly the same way about traditional media — that it’s self obsessed, cash for comment, and regurgitating the messages of the interests it serves. \n\nWhile the old guard might scoff at courting for content, YouTubers, TikTokers, SubStackers, Podcasters and Instagrammers have something that institutions do not — they’re people. Not representatives of a party, a platform or a conglomerate, but people who have built a one-to-many relationship that still feels deeply connected, relatable and real to their audiences. \n\nI promise you, they are not seeking to become the media, nor do many of them consider themselves “journalists”. It will remain the media’s job to reimagine itself to (rightly) re-engage younger audiences. Political campaigns and the news itself are foot soldiers in an information war that is coming at people from all angles, 24/7 and on repeat. It’s not ideal, but it’s reality. \n\nMedia and politics alike are numbers games. You have to go where your audience is going, otherwise you’ll go nowhere. The numbers point to a new future for political coverage and perhaps politics itself — one that is less centralised, more personalised and more real. \n\nCreators have something most legacy institutions no longer possess: trust. And in an age of fractured attention spans, that’s the ultimate currency. TLDR: Entertain or die.\n\nHave something to say about this article? Write to us at letters@crikey.com.au.

In the days after the summit, the downtown reverted back to a filthy equilibrium. In the previous five years, the state of California squandered $24 billion on failed attempts to address the homeless crisis. Yet, Xi’s visit laid bare the true nature of California’s political machinery — an insular, dynastic system dominated by ultrawealthy progressives whose priorities shift when the right people are watching.\n\nIn Fool’s Gold: The Radicals, Con Artists, and Traitors Who Killed the California Dream and Now Threaten Us All, investigative journalists Susan Crabtree and Jedd McFatter deliver a gripping expose of California’s entrenched political machine and uncover many of its secrets for the first time. They argue that California, and especially San Francisco, has become the Democratic Party’s center of gravity, aggressively exporting its brand of progressive politics to the rest of the country. “It’s time to stop the contagion from spreading,” they warn.\n\nCalifornia, despite its vast resources, is in steep decline after decades of progressive rule. The state faces a $68 billion budget deficit. It has the nation’s highest poverty rate at 18.9% and 28% of America’s homeless population. A potent symbol of its decay is the Bay Area’s thriving drug market, aided by sanctuary laws, which has triggered a real estate boom in Honduras where successful fentanyl dealers have returned to build gaudy mansions emblazoned with the logos of the Golden State Warriors and the San Francisco 49ers. \n\nFool’s Gold is a sharp, meticulously researched, and timely analysis of California’s decline and the political forces sustaining its one-party rule. California, once the state of Reagan and Nixon, began swinging left in the 1980’s. The Democratic takeover was accelerated by “military base closings after the end of the Cold War, the flight of tech, aviation, and other businesses to states with lower taxes; amnesty and sanctuary policies that opened the floodgates to illegal immigration; and San Francisco’s liberal contagion spreading south.”\n\nThis was, in many ways, the triumph of a tight-knit social network that began to form in the first half of the 20th century. In 1942, current Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D-CA) grandfather, William Newsom, steered Pat Brown’s campaign for district attorney. When Brown later ran for governor, he again tapped William Newsom to run his campaign. It was a relationship mirrored many decades later when Brown’s son Jerry Brown served as governor, with Gavin Newsom as his lieutenant. Woven into this fascinating saga are the Pelosis and the billionaire Getty clan, whose money has sustained the power of the Bay Area aristocracy in city and state politics for decades. \n\nIn Fool’s Gold, Crabtree and McFatter ruthlessly shed light on California’s “failed progressive vision.” Across nine gripping chapters, the book dissects California’s murky entanglements with the Chinese Communist Party, its scourge of devastating wildfires caused by a combination of natural dryness and manmade forestry mismanagement, and the looting of the state treasury by an impossible array of progressive causes, while offering incisive portraits of the powerful figures — Gavin Newsom, Adam Schiff, Kamala Harris, and Willie Brown — who have shaped and benefited from the state’s trajectory.\n\nThe book is, in many respects, a takedown of Gavin Newsom, a formidable and clever politician who, the authors say, in a lurch into psychiatric diagnostics that may extend beyond their own expertise, “exhibits the ‘dark triad’ personality traits that ought to disqualify a person from achieving power of any kind.” But the question remains: does he carry enough personal baggage to doom his future presidential ambitions? \n\nThe authors allege that he secretly paid for the $91,000 bronze statue of himself that sits in San Francisco’s monumental Beaux-Arts City Hall and that it was his mentor Jerry Brown, not the baseball scholarship which he often alleges, that gained him admission into Santa Clara University back in 1985. They also say that in the wake of the 2018 Camp Fire, he bailed out utility giant PG&E and diverted blame to oil and gas companies after the provider made significant donations benefiting him and his wife. Gavin Newsom has proven resilient to personal scandals in the past, even his infamous lockdown-breaching dinner at the French Laundry in 2020. In 2021, he easily survived the statewide recall effort driven by his own highly unpopular pandemic response. But confronting some of the questions raised in Fool’s Gold will be a challenge for the governor. \n\nPerhaps the most damning claims concern Gavin Newsom’s ties to China, which began during his mayoral tenure. Using a nonprofit organization called ChinaSF, launched by the city in 2008, the then-mayor sought to attract Chinese businesses to San Francisco and beyond through a variety of clever incentives that promised to remove bureaucratic obstacles. Among the businesses that came in through this scheme were solar companies that flooded the U.S. market with cheaper alternatives and were a factor in the 2011 collapse of Solyndra. Unbothered by the optics, he later appointed Yu Ben Meng as chief investment officer of the California state pension system, whose funds were then invested into various Chinese defense companies. (Meng, who resigned in the wake of scandal in 2020, now serves as deputy CIO at China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange in Beijing.)\n\nWHY THE RED TIDE IS RISING IN CALIFORNIA \n\nFor now, California progressivism seems to be on its heels. The 2024 election dealt a devastating blow to California progressives from Harris to Los Angeles District Attorney George Gascon and San Francisco Mayor London Breed. California voters further reversed progressive policies by passing Proposition 36, which enhances penalties for theft and drug offenses. Yet don’t count out Gavin Newsom. Crabtree and McFatter’s critique of the “California way” and its charismatic governor is well-timed. This month, Gavin Newsom launched a podcast, which some have viewed as a launchpad for his 2028 presidential ambitions. It features the governor sparring with right-wingers such as Steve Bannon and Charlie Kirk and conceding ground on tactical matters such as transgender athletes. Gavin Newsom seems to be attempting to rebrand as a moderate. \n\n“More than any current politician, Newsom has executed the progressive vision across his city and state with swiftness and precision,” Fool’s Gold demonstrates. But this is a portrait of a highly effective politician who will survive and triangulate however he must, not of an ideologue who will die for the cause. For anybody seeking to understand the past, present, and future of the Democratic Party and the inner workings of its California stronghold, Fool’s Gold is an essential and exhilarating read.\n\nCarson Becker is an American writer.","summary":"In November 2023, downtown San Francisco underwent a sudden transformation.

Of those aged over 70, 76.32 per cent cast their vote for the Opposition Leader in the survey, as did 69.52 per cent of those aged 60-69, and 66 per cent of people aged 50-59.\n\nThat preference drops slightly to 59.75 per cent for the 40-49 age group and again to 54.42 per cent for the 30-39 demographic.\n\nThis federal election will be the first where Gen Z and Millennial voters will outnumber Baby Boomers, and there have already been clear signs that both sides are trying to grab the attention of younger voters.\n\nBoth Mr Albanese and Mr Dutton have appeared on popular podcasts in recent months, a tactic we saw used throughout the US election, with Donald Trump appearing on The Joe Rogan Experience and Kamala Harris speaking with Alex Cooper on the Call Her Daddy podcast.\n\nAmong Mr Albanese’s most notable appearance was when he sat down with Australian media personality Abbie Chatfield for a long-form chat on her It’s A Lot podcast.\n\nFor Mr Dutton, his most talked about foray into the podcast world was his 90-minute conversation with entrepreneur and self-made millionaire Mark Bouris on his podcast Straight Talk.\n\nThrough these interviews, it has been clear the politicians are trying to target very different parts of the youth voter demographic.\n\nThe majority of Ms Chatfield’s listeners are women and her social media content is skewed toward a younger female audience.\n\nIn the interview, Mr Albanese also spoke about Labor’s support for women’s health, including policies relating to endometriosis care, contraceptives and menopause.\n\nIn Mr Dutton’s interview with Mr Bouris, he clearly targeted a different audience.\n\nHe said that young men are fed up with being painted as “ogres” and are feeling “disenfranchised and ostracised” as a result.\n\nWhen we split the results from The Great Aussie Debate survey by gender, it is clear that Mr Dutton is more popular with men than with women.\n\nOf those surveyed, 68.17 per cent of men said they would vote for Mr Dutton.\n\nWhile the majority of women still favoured the Opposition Leader, the gap was significantly smaller, with 53.61 per cent compared to 46.39 per cent preferring Mr Albanese.\n\nThe only group where Mr Albanese was the preferred candidate was among non-binary respondents, with 59.47 per cent preferring the current PM and just 40.53 per cent wanting Mr Dutton to take the reins.\n\nThis is far from the first time the first time the gender divide between supporters for the two candidates has been highlighted.\n\nPreviously speaking to news.com.au, Dr Intifar Chowdhury, lecturer in Government at Flinders University, noted men, particularly between the ages of 18 and 34, were showing an increased preference towards Mr Dutton compared to women in the same age range.\n\nShe said this difference in opinion could result from a series of factors, including economic standing, education, whether they are from inner-city or remote areas, or whether they work a blue-collar or white-collar job.\n\nThese factors can push people toward what Dr Chowdhury labelled “anti-government rhetorics” and small pockets of “online battlegrounds where younger voters are relating to authoritarian and anti-feminist messaging where we’re seeing a starker rift between men and women”.\n\nShe said that while Gen Z and Millennials may seem to hold more progressive views than their older counterparts, there is still a sense of “political unpredictability”, which could see them end up being “powerbrokers or wildcards” of the next election.\n\n“Although young people do have a progressive-leaning, they do not necessarily neatly align with either of the major parties,” Dr Chowdhury said.\n\n“Younger people are more volatile voters compared to older people and this means that the way they vote might be quite sensitive to the election campaign.”\n\nNews.com.au also dug deeper into how Australian’s make their decision when it comes time to head to the polling booth, gaining key insight into the issues they care about.\n\nThe majority of respondents, 52 per cent, said they would vote for “whichever party offers the best policies for me and my family”.\n\nThe second most common response indicated that many Aussies they have already made up their mind well before an election, with almost 13 per cent always voting for the same party.\n\nThis was followed by 12.2 per cent of people who said a party focused on “rebuilding Australian values” was important to them, while 11.2 per cent placed the most importance on relief from the cost of living. \n\nOne of the factors least likely to decide a person’s vote related to a party’s international affairs policy, with just 0.83 per cent choosing this option, indicating Aussies are more concerned about domestic issues heading into the election.\n\nJust four per cent of respondents said they would be voting for the “leader I like the most”, showing that, while preference for a leader may be a consideration, it has far less of an impact than policy or economic concerns.\n\nThe full results of news.com.au’s Great Aussie Debate survey will be published in the coming weeks, after the federal election.","summary":"A new survey has revealed what Australians are really thinking just weeks out from the election - and there is a very clear favourite to

Opportunity Democrats Do Not","text":"A man who was an aide to former President Joe Biden said Thursday on Fox News that there’s a contrast between how Democrats handle press interactions versus how President Donald Trump handles them.\n\nThat man, Michael LaRosa, appeared on “The Ingraham Angle” to say that Trump understands something about the media that Democrats do not.\n\nHost Laura Ingraham asked about the strategy behind Biden’s nomination. She said that the Biden campaign controlled media coverage tightly and restricted journalists at events and even limited phone usage at small gatherings where Biden relied heavily on a teleprompter. Former White House press secretary Ari Fleischer criticized Democrats for expecting the press to align with them and for not tolerating media scrutiny. LaRosa said he agreed and also said Democrats should emulate the way Trump engages with the press.\n\n“Yeah, and the one event that Joe Biden has done since he left the White House, they also told people that they’re not allowed to record it. They didn’t want anybody to see it. There was no press allowed,” Fleischer said. “Here’s the problem that Democrats have with the press. They expect the press to work for them. They know that the press is ideologically aligned with them. They know that the press doesn’t like Donald Trump, and so they expect the press to fall in line.”\n\nFleischer said Republicans expect tough media coverage and do not expect loyalty from the press, which contrasts with Democrats, who expect media compliance.\n\n“Now, therefore, if there ever is an aberration to that pattern, they’d berate the press in a way like Republicans do not do. Republicans understand we’re gonna get a hard time from the press no matter what. That bar is low,” Fleischer said. “If we ever have a good day in the press, it’s because there was a low bar, and we jumped over it. And so we don’t have to worry about the press betraying us [the way] that Democrats do. And on those rare occasions when the press actually holds an account, they can’t stand it because they think the press is their employee.”\n\nThe former Biden aide agreed and said Democrats need to change the way they approach media relations. (RELATED: Black Voter In Swing State Says The One Thing Democrats Don’t Want To Hear)\n\n“I would just somewhat agree with him because I think what President Trump does is sort of what I would advise every Democrat to do, but it reflects a problem in our party. This culture of treating the press as a hazard instead of an opportunity,” Larosa said. “Trump doesn’t miss the opportunity to speak to a microphone. He engages, and he’s proactive. It’s the opposite with Democrats. And we have to get over that because voters crave authenticity. You can’t be authentic, or you can’t be perceived as authentic if you are never in unscripted environments.”\n\nBiden avoided interacting with the media and did not hold the traditional press conference in 2023.

It’s far better than the -10 point rating he had in March 2017 and the -7 point rating Americans gave him after the November election, according to aggregate polling compiled by CNN analyst Harry Enten. \n\nEnten gave the network’s lefty viewers a “reality check” this week with the new poll numbers, showing Trump has a high favorability rating now than at any point in his first term.\n\n“All we talk about is how unpopular Donald Trump is,” Enten began. “But in reality, he’s basically more popular than he was at any point in term number one and more popular than he was when he won the election back in November of 2024.” \n\n“So when you compare Trump against himself, he’s actually closer to the apex than he is to the bottom of the trough,” the CNN analyst explained. “And of course, that’s so important because Donald Trump, historically speaking, has had his numbers underestimated.” \n\n“I think it’s very important to compare [Trump] to himself, to understand that he’s actually more popular now than he was when he won, or certainly where he was at this point back in his first term.” \n\nTo further help viewers understand how popular Trump is at the moment, Enten broke out polls showing the percentage of Americans indicating that the country is on the right track. \n\nThe CNN analyst pointed to a recent Marist survey showing 45% of Americans indicating that America is on the right track – the second highest percentage that the pollster has measured since 2009 – and a NBC News poll finding 44% of Americans thinking the same – the highest since 2004. \n\n“The bottom line is, the percentage of Americans who say we’re on the right track is through the roof,” Enten asserted. \n\n“And if you were to compare it to when presidents have historically been re-elected, of course, Trump is not constitutionally eligible to run for re-election, but I think it sort of puts it in perspective, 42% of the country says the country is on the right track when the incumbent party is re-elected,” he added. \n\nEnten noted that just before former Vice President Kamala Harris lost to Trump, and Democrats lost their Senate majority, “only about 27% to 28% of the country said the country was on the right track.”\n\n“The bottom line is, right now, a much higher percentage of the country says we’re on the right track.” \n\nAll this bodes well for congressional Republicans in the 2026 midterm elections, according to Enten, who said “the generic congressional ballot” in 2026 polls thus far “looks a heck of a lot more like when Republicans win than when Democrats win.”","summary":"“I think it's very important to compare [Trump] to himself, to understand that he's actually more popular now than he was when he won, or certainly where he was at this point back in

Museums","text":"US President Donald Trump signed an executive order Thursday to remove \"improper ideology\" from the famed Smithsonian Museums -- and the National Zoo -- expanding his conservative clampdown on cultural institutions.Trump, who has sought to root out what he called \"woke\" culture since returning to power in January, accused the Smithsonian of trying to rewrite American history on issues of race and gender.His order puts hardline Vice President JD Vance in charge of efforts to carry out the order at the Smithsonian's museums, educations and research centers.Trump said this should include a drive to \"remove improper ideology from such properties.\"The Smithsonian operates 21 internationally renowned museums and galleries, mainly in and around Washington, dedicated to art, science, space and American history.They include the National Zoo in the US capital, which recently welcomed two giant pandas from China, debuting them to the public just days after Trump's inauguration for a second term.The presidential order -- titled \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History\" -- targeted a number of examples of what it also called \"corrosive ideology.\"It said the National Museum of African American History and Culture, one of the newest Smithsonian additions, had described hard work and the nuclear family as \"aspects of 'White Culture.'\"Trump also targeted what he said was a plan by the as-yet-unopened American Women's history museum for \"celebrating the exploits of male athletes participating in women's sports.\"There was no immediate reaction from the Smithsonian.The Smithsonian Institute was founded in the mid-19th century with a donation from a deceased and childless British chemist, James Smithson, who asked in his will for his wealth to be used to create an educational institution in the then-young United States -- a country he had never set foot in.Trump's wide-ranging 21st century effort to reshape the US government has increasingly extended to cultural issues, where he is seeking to stamp his conservative mark.The 78-year-old Republican recently took over the chairmanship of the Kennedy Center in Washington, a famed arts venue, after complaining that it was too liberal.The president has also eyed reforms in governance of the US capital city, which he has repeatedly complained of having high crime and unsightly nuisances such as graffiti.In a separate order on Thursday titled \"Making the District of Columbia Safe and Beautiful,\" Trump directed the creation of an inter-agency task force to increase immigration enforcement and other law enforcement priorities.It also calls for the development of a \"coordinated beautification plan\" for the city.\"We will take over our horribly run Washington,

Bush ahead of the 2008 election when he ran with Obama. \n\nIn the end, Allen and Parnes suggested whether Harris won or lost in her race against Trump 'she would only harm him by publicly distancing herself from him' as Biden staffers remained with her campaign.\n\nAt one point, the authors claim, Sean Clegg - a Harris advisor who was not trusted by the Biden staffers - was helping the vice president prepare for a joint appearance with her running mate Tim Walz, when she started listing things that she and Biden accomplished.\n\nClegg quickly stopped her, according to the book. \n\n'Wait, wait, wait! Let’s not do this. Let’s not go down memory lane,' Clegg said, according to an excerpt previously published by The Hill.\n\nFor the remark, Clegg was reportedly disinvited from future media prep sessions by longtime Dem communications staffer Stephanie Cutter. \n\nHarris aides have also claimed that the Biden team was deliberately not working with them as a result of the president being forced to drop out.\n\nPreviously, Biden was blamed by senior Harris advisor David Plouffe for her loss because he refused to drop out of the race sooner.\n\nHe had claimed no Democratic candidate could have won without a proper primary process—what he called 'the cardinal sin' of this race.\n\nAnd he said he was shocked by the internal polling numbers when he finally joined the team after Biden dropped out with less than four months to go, a situation he described as 'catastrophic.'\n\n'When I got in, it was the first time I saw the actual numbers under the hood. They were pretty gruesome,' he told The Atlantic. \n\nIn the end, Harris and Walz lost every single swing state to Trump, leading to an electoral college blowout.\n\nIt marked the first Democrat ticket to lose the popular vote since 2004 and just the second since 1988.","summary":"Democrats had been secretly planning for former President Joe Biden to either drop out of the presidential race or even 'die in office' as far back as 2023, a damning new book claims.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14545359/Democrats-secretly-planning-Biden-withdraw-die-office.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/28/00/96655227-0-image-m-21_1743122087627.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-28 00:44:06","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.375}]}
