Described as a $20 million effort to “study the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality” in male-dominated spaces online (such as video games), the “SAM” fundraising pitch was roasted by everyone from left-wing podcasters, to Kamala Harris 2024 operatives, to Joe Biden’s former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who discussed the proposal with The Bulwark. \n\n After days of watching derisive comments pile up on online and on TV (including on Fox News), and joking among ourselves about starting a competing “Speaking to Dudes” plan for only $19 million (codename: “STD”), Rolling Stone decided to get to the bottom of questions that until now remained publicly unanswered, including: Who or what is “SAM,” and who is actually running this thing? \n\n Our reporting soon led us to the names of two Democratic Party heavy-hitters running the “SAM Project,” as well as to some of the national party’s stalwarts who offered preemptive, hefty derision toward the new effort. \n\n Certain details of this project had been circulating in Democratic circles for weeks. One Democrat who received the fundraising prospectus says that they saw it, skimmed it, then closed it immediately because what they had seen seemed so “fucking stupid.” \n\n Still, we wanted to see for ourselves, so we reached out to the two key figures behind the SAM Project to learn more about it and review its much-discussed fundraising prospectus (embedded below). The group also shared with us its 31-page presentation titled, “How to Stop Losing the Culture Wars — and Win Back Men.”\n\n “Speaking with American Men” is being led by Ilyse Hogue, the former president of the abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America, and John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Kennedy School’s Institute of Politics and an adviser to Biden’s 2020 campaign. The project’s fundraising pitch lists former Rep. Colin Allred (D-Texas), a one-time NFL player who lost a Senate race to Ted Cruz last year, as part of the SAM Project team.\n\n In a joint interview with Rolling Stone on Wednesday, Della Volpe and Hogue wanted to clarify a few things. (Yes, they have seen the mean social media posts.) \n\n For one thing, they stress that the $20 million they set out to raise is for a two-year budget, which would be dedicated to not just research, but also for outreach, organizing efforts, and communications. The group intends to study and engage niche communities popular with young men of different races and backgrounds, including in forums and spaces focused on video games, cryptocurrencies, fitness, and DIY videos. \n\n The point of the project, they explain, is to listen to “a cohort of young people who don’t feel like the Democratic Party hears them or cares about them,” as Della Volpe puts it. He says Democrats’ failure in 2024 was about “over relying on analytics and not listening to people,” and that the Harris campaign did “something that no other [Democratic] campaign this century has done, which is to not optimize young people.”\n\n Hogue and Della Volpe both sought to warn Democrats last year about their growing problems with men, particularly younger men. Hogue wrote several pieces for The Bulwark last year about Trump’s appeals to young men and Democrats’ “male voter problem.” Della Volpe wrote an op-ed for the Times about how Trump was successfully “exploiting the fears and insecurities of young men.” \n\n Their SAM Project is not just a fundraising pitch — it’s happening. Without saying how much money they’ve raised, Hogue confirms they’ve received “initial investment in the work that we’re doing and a lot of interest, honestly, in the research that is coming out of it.” Over the past two months, Della Volpe’s research firm conducted 30 focus groups among men aged 18-29. \n\n “This level of listening is something that these young men have expressed explicitly that they have been waiting for for a long time,” says Hogue, adding that “$20 million seems like actually a drop in the bucket when you think about what is being spent over … a two-year cycle on speaking to voters. It actually feels pretty modest when you think about by how much we lost this group and how much we have to make up ground.” \n\n The SAM Project says it is being fiscally sponsored by Democracy Matters, a Washington-based nonprofit with ties to David Brock’s liberal American Bridge network. \n\n While some of the planks in the SAM Project documents risk coming off as ham-fisted (“Develop, disseminate, and test high-quality, meme-friendly content”), the group aspires to engage with real problems, such as how the right radicalizes men via online platforms — “utilizing the algorithms to cycle them into a right-wing funnel.” \n\n It also highlights key financial concerns that young men face in today’s society: “job security, home ownership, wage growth, and affordable education/trade programs.” The prospectus seeks to “highlight the ways in which billionaire-backed culture war distractions serve as a smokescreen to divert attention from economic inequality, stagnating wages, and corporate exploitation.”\n\n The SAM Project’s presentation notes that young men recognize that “institutions have failed them.” They feel “let down by politics, education, law enforcement, and labor systems.” They “don’t believe Democrats fight for them, but many don’t think Republicans care either.” And they have “learned to expect neglect, not support.”\n\n The presentation says that “economic insecurity cuts across income and identity,” and young men are “overwhelmed by the cost of living, the instability of work, and the distance between what was promised and what’s real.”\n\n On the other hand, the SAM Project’s financial solutions, as described in the fundraising prospectus, seem fairly small-ball: “expanded child tax credits, homebuyer incentives, and workforce training.” Democrats’ 2024 platform, which failed to drive necessary support among young men, already contained references to such items. (The SAM Project team advises developing “specific language” to frame these policies “as a path to economic empowerment rather than government dependency,” which almost sounds like a conservative talking point.)\n\n Asked about the fact that Democrats had already pitched similar ideas during the Harris campaign, Hogue says it’s impossible for the party to “build trust” around their economic policies “if you’re not in the spaces [where] people are debating them far in advance of the election, and the Democrats were completely absent from those spaces.”\n\n Hogue says there are areas where many young men agree with Democrats, such as on social issues, as well as on economic policies, but the latter are “not being emphasized.” She explains that “unless the Democrats are saying these are top priorities because they affect young men, which they really were not, then that’s not going to resonate as much as it could.”\n\n The SAM Project presentation indicates that many young men view Democrats as weak — and “want leadership that signals strength, clarity, and follow-through — especially in a world that feels unstable and demanding.” The document says there appears to be some level of “generational tolerance for authoritarian tendencies,” relating in part to institutions that aren’t working for them. \n\n Hogue says that, in their research so far, what they’ve been hearing from people is that “‘Democrats don’t care about us, [and] even if they did care about us, they’re weak. They can’t get anything done.’ And that is an issue — that is a gap, a chasm, that needs to be addressed.”\n\n The presentation quotes a Hispanic man from a rural background saying of Trump: “I think he has that strong man, you know, vibe that definitely a lot of guys, you know, like or relate to. I think people view him as, you know, kinda tearing down the structures that maybe they feel haven’t helped them.”\n\n The duo fronting SAM are acutely aware that they have, even at this early stage, their fair share of intra-party critics who appear far from being won over. Several of these SAM Project skeptics are not mincing words, either.\n\n “I think both Ilyse and John are smart, talented operatives who have very good intentions. I think broadly, writ large — and this is hardly unique to Ilyse and John — it is beyond embarrassing that in the year 2025, the Democratic Party wants to spend tens of millions of dollars to figure out how to talk to half of the population. It really isn’t that hard,” says Ammar Moussa, formerly the rapid response director for Harris’ 2024 campaign. “This really isn’t rocket science. We’re treating young men and working class voters like they’re foreign aliens who just visited earth who are speaking a different language. And to some degree, we are [speaking a different language], for a multitude of reasons — mostly because the Democratic Party is staffed with operatives who no longer reflect what the electorate looks like anymore. And that’s a problem.”\n\n But, Moussa adds: “This isn’t a zoo!”\n\n The Democrat who received the SAM Project’s prospectus, and who requested anonymity, says: “What pissed me off is that we’re doing all this research trying to find out the right combination of words to try to get them to like us, rather than understanding what their struggles and dreams are, and what they want out of life, and meeting them there.” This person also argues that multi-million dollar fundraising efforts such as this run the risk of siphoning “money from organizations actually doing the work.”\n\n One other Democratic recipient of the fundraising document says the pitch — particularly things like the use of word “syntax” — made the project read as broadly “condescending” to young American men. The price-tag of $20 million also seemed “way too expensive,” this source says, referring to the idea of conducting a “safari-type study” of young male voters “as if they are a different species” as “insulting … why do this?”\n\n But Hogue and Della Volpe contend that the issue is that there simply aren’t enough effective messengers or committed Democrats actually doing the work in these spaces, and that any liberal consultants or Democratic officials saying otherwise are fooling themselves.\n\n In Hogue’s view: “‘Syntax’ is obviously sort of an academic word, but the way that breaks down for me is, when I, in the summer of 2024, was saying, ‘Hey guys, we have a problem. Trump just did a town hall on Kick with Adin Ross,’ and Democratic operatives were saying to me, ‘I don’t understand a single word you’re saying,’ that is a problem. When I wrote a piece earlier that year about the intentionality of RFK Jr. doing his failed presidential launch, bench pressing shirtless in jeans, which was a direct line to the red-pill fitness channels, online Democratic operatives looked at me and said, ‘I’ve never heard of red-pill fitness.’ So they are free to suggest that the focus on language is a problem, but they don’t understand the language that people are speaking in the spaces where they are absent.”\n\n “The solution is not word-smithing our way to better slogans,” says Della Volpe, arguing that he and critics of the SAM Project likely “feel the same way around understanding values and experiences. There’s a misrepresentation, I think, of what the project is about.”\n\n Here’s the SAM prospectus.

No more insistence that he was sharp when you met him,” Phillips wrote at The Free Press. \n\n“The whole truth will come out, and they would be wise to get ahead of it.”\n\nThen he twisted the knife.\n\n“If a relatively little-known congressman like me knew that Biden was incapable of leading the country in a second term, what does that say about the complicity of the real party bosses whose names we all know?” Phillips asked.\n\nThe two Dems’ rhetoric makes for an engrossing preview of a stark new dividing line within their party — one that’s sure to play a role in not just upcoming governors’ and Senate elections, but the 2028 contest to succeed Trump.\n\nIt’s between those who would paper over the Biden scandal or even deny it entirely, and those who believe it should politically disqualify all those complicit in it. \n\nAnd it won’t fade anytime soon: Early surveys of the 2028 Democratic primary field find Harris consistently on top, with former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg finishing in the top three.\n\nBoth will be plagued by the lies they told in service of their old boss should they throw their hats in the ring.\n\nHarris famously smeared Special Counsel Robert Hur for informing the American people that their commander-in-chief had wondered aloud if he was “still” vice president in 2009 — the very year he assumed the office for the first time.\n\nAnd Buttigieg vouched for the president’s brain function by claiming he’d had to call in an Amtrak “expert” to handle Biden’s “detailed” questions about trains.\n\nThey’ll have a lot to answer for on the primary debate stage when their rivals ask why they misled the American people — not to mention what else they might be willing to lie about.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, too, might face such questions should Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez choose to challenge him come 2028.\n\nThe Democrats’ internal reckoning over the Biden coverup is bound to be especially painful because it largely overlaps with existing cracks between the establishment and activist wings of the party.\n\nProgressives in favor of adopting an even more unabashedly leftist agenda have long accused party elites of selling out their voters and their values in pursuit of power.\n\nIn turn, those elites have charged progressives with prioritizing ideological purity and factional goals over winning elections.\n\nFor the former group, the coverup reinforces the first narrative.\n\nFor the latter, continued recriminations against Biden and his team reinforce the second.\n\nIt’s said that time heals all wounds — but progressives in particular have an interest in keeping this one open and bleeding.\n\nCold, hard proof that party insiders were lying about the condition of the man with the nuclear codes is a visceral demonstration of the rot that leftists have long described.\n\nIt’s the kind of disgrace that can destroy presidential campaigns — and compel the sweeping, party-wide transformation they seek.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"Every major administration official who served under Joe Biden helped hide the president’s decline — and some Dems are using the public's outrage to their political advantage.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/28/opinion/joe-bidens-scandal-lit-the-fuse-on-a-democratic-civil-war/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/djeldmd.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 22:33:40","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":325917474,"title":"Witness female Secret Service agents in a brawl near Obama’s residence, with one threatening to ‘beat her up’","text":"This is the incident where two female Secret Service agents engaged in a brawl outside Barack Obama’s residence in Washington DC, with one heard over the radio threatening to “whoop this girl’s a**.”\n\nShocking footage shows the uniformed officers swinging punches and shoving each other in the dead of night, just two miles from the White House.\n\nIn the jaw-dropping clip, one agent can be seen grabbing her radio and calling for help.\n\nShe yelled: “I need a supervisor out here… immediately before I whoop this girl’s a**.” \n\nThe bust-up reportedly erupted around 2.30am local time on May 21 outside the ex-president’s upscale Kalorama residence.\n\nThe video was shared on X by RealClearPolitics reporter Susan Crabtree on Tuesday.\n\nIt was reported: “#BREAKING AND EXCLUSIVE: @RCPolitics has secured footage of the altercation between two female Secret Service Uniformed Division Officers outside former President Obama’s home last week, after one officer requested a supervisor’s presence before ‘I whoop this girl’s a**.’”\n\nThe Secret Service confirmed the fight to The New York Post, saying the agents involved have been suspended.\n\nA representative stated: “The U.S. Secret Service acknowledges an on-duty confrontation that took place between two Uniformed Division officers at roughly 2:30 a.m. on May 21.”\n\n“The individuals involved were suspended from duty and this matter is the subject of an internal investigation. \n\n“The Secret Service has a very strict code of conduct for all employees and any behavior that violates that code is unacceptable.\n\n“Given this is a personnel matter, we are not in a position to comment further.”\n\nThe agency has yet to confirm whether the brawling agents outside Obama’s home are still on the job.\n\nThe brawl is just the latest embarrassment for the Secret Service — which has spent the past year lurching from one scandal to another.\n\nLast April, Michelle Herczeg – assigned to then-Vice President Kamala Harris – allegedly attacked a supervisor after being pulled from duty for throwing sanitary pads and screaming at colleagues, according to reports.\n\nIn September, the agency was rocked by bombshell claims that one of its agents sexually assaulted a Kamala Harris staffer during a night out in Wisconsin. \n\nThe alleged assault reportedly took place in a hotel room after the agent and several staffers had been out drinking. \n\nWitnesses said the agent was so drunk they were thrown out and passed out in the hallway, where colleagues snapped photos of them.\n\nThe agent was placed on administrative leave and the Office of Professional Responsibility launched a misconduct probe.\n\nAt the time, a Harris campaign spokesperson said: “The Office of the Vice President takes the safety of staff seriously.

Trump utilized the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a wartime law that grants the commander in chief authority to detain or deport non-citizens. The implementation was originally blocked in federal court and has since sparked a contentious legal back-and-forth.The Supreme Court originally upheld Trump's implementation of the act, but it ruled that deportees have the right to challenge their removal in a proper venue before being removed.What To KnowOcasio-Cortez has revived her opposition to ICE, calling it a \"rogue agency that should not exist,\" Fox News reported, citing a fundraising email obtained by the outlet.The White House called out the lawmaker on Wednesday saying in part, \"While President Donald J. Trump, his administration, and the heroes of ICE work overtime to rid our country of criminal illegal immigrant killers, rapists, and gangbangers, top Democrats are doubling down on their call to eliminate the agency responsible for getting these animals off our streets.\"The statement went on to reference the reported fundraising email, quoting Ocasio-Cortez saying, \"I believe that ICE, an agency that was just formed in 2003 during the Patriot Act era, is a rogue agency that should not exist.\"It then refers to her as \"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the leader of the Democrat Party.\"\"Where is the congresswoman's concern for her fellow New Yorkers who have been brutally killed, maimed, and raped by criminal illegal immigrants allowed to roam free due to New York's so-called 'sanctuary' policies?\" the White House said, listing recent ICE arrests in New York.Democrats have seemingly been in disarray since losing the White House, Senate and Congress after the election. Uncertainty about which figureheads to support within the party has also eroded internal cohesion.It is unclear whom the party will rally behind in 2028, as the field is wide open. Early polling, however, suggests that Ocasio-Cortez, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, California Governor Gavin Newsom, and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker are all potential front-runners.What People Are SayingWhite House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in the statement on Wednesday: \"AOC, Democrat Party leader, calls for abolishing ICE. Meanwhile, the brave men and women of ICE get dangerous criminal illegal immigrants off our streets and protect American citizens. Why does AOC want to stop that?\"House Speaker Mike Johnson, Wednesday on X, formerly Twitter: \"Democrats still want to CLOSE DOWN ICE and OPEN UP our borders. It's not going to happen. Under President Trump, our border is SECURE once again and with the One Big Beautiful Bill, we'll provide ICE with additional funding for 10,000 new ICE officers and more detention space.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, last week on X: \"TPS [Temporary Protected Status] allowed thousands of Venezuelan families who fled to the U.S. to live and work here legally.

With her 13-point, 15-rebound performance in the Chicago Sky's 89-94 loss to the Phoenix Mercury, Reese surpassed Tina Charles, the 2012 MVP who spent most of her career with the Connecticut Sun and New York Liberty.Some fans took the opportunity to criticize Reese, given that she averages the most field goal attempts per game from within five feet (9.0) but is just 33.3% from that distance, a percentage worse than the next 48 players below her in field goal attempts per game from within five feet.In defense of Reese, Michael Jordan's former teammate, Etan Thomas, took to X to congratulate her. Along with his congratulatory message, he shared a quote from his podcast, \"The Collision: Sports and Politics,\" alleging that those who criticize the Sky forward are the same people who criticized former U.S. presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\"It's interesting how a lot of the same demographic of Black Men who go out of their way to bash Angel Reese even as she sets WNBA records, are same group of Black Men who were bashing Kamala Harris,\" Thomas said.Angel Reese takes accountability for the defense on Alyssa Thomas in Tuesday's lossIn Tuesday's Chicago Sky loss to the Phoenix Mercury, five-time All-Star Alyssa Thomas logged a 10-point, 15-assist double-double.

Alongside Georgia, other key swing states like Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin turned blue in 2020 but switched back to red by 2024.\n\nFor politicians and presidential hopefuls, Georgia’s new status as a battleground state underscored its importance in securing a path to the White House. Biden secured Georgia’s 16 electoral votes in the 2020 election, but Trump reclaimed them in 2024, highlighting the state’s evolving political landscape. \n\nFormer gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, who lost to Governor Brian Kemp twice, played a pivotal role in flipping both of Georgia’s U.S. Senate seats blue. However, she was unsuccessful running for governor, losing to Kemp in 2022 and 2018. Governor Kemp is term limited in the next election cycle. \n\nThe gubernatorial race in Georgia is already heating up with State Senator Jason Esteves and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms throwing their hats into the ring. Bottoms says she plans to expand Medicaid and tap federal dollars to help uninsured and underinsured Georgians get healthcare coverage. \n\nOn the Republican side, Attorney General Chris Carr is the sole candidate at the moment, but there’s speculation that Lieutenant Governor Burt Jones may enter that race or the U.S. Senate Race. Political experts say that current Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger could also be a strong contender on the Republican side. Insurance Commissioner John King has also said he will run for the U.S. Senate race against Sen. Jon Ossoff in 2026.\n\nWith a slew of candidates, the gubernatorial and senate races in 2026 face a potential run off race if a candidate does not secure one more than 50% of the votes.\n\nAs for the Democrats, while no potential contenders for president are expected from Georgia, there is widespread speculation that former Vice President Kamala Harrs may run again. Harris may also run for the Governor of California. Other potential Democratic candidates include California Governor Gavin Newsom, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. \n\nGeorgia is also a crucial state for Republicans to maintain their current three seat majority in the U.S. Senate. While political analysts say Kemp had a strong shot to defeat Ossoff, they are now keeping a close watch on the peach state to try to secure another seat in the Senate if Georgia flips red for the Senate race.\n\nIn the meantime, Georgia voters will likely see more political ads, texts and campaign stops in the months ahead for both the gubernatorial race and the U.S. Senate race in 2026. And once that is done, it will be a full race ahead to the 2028 election season. \n\nWill Kemp run for president or leave the political arena? His decision will likely be a key factor in what Georgia voters decide in the coming years and have a great impact on the national landscape.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nATLANTA () &#8211; Georgia, historically a strong Republican stronghold, has recently become&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Georgia&#8217;s Political Outlook: Insights from Atlanta&#8217;s Leading Bureau Chief first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/georgias-political-outlook-insights-from-atlantas-leading-bureau-chief/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Analyzing-Georgia039s-political-future-Atlanta-Bureau-Chief-explains.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 20:05:30","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":325884702,"title":"Bruce Springsteen Is Under Attack by Trump. These Are All the Artists Supporting Him","text":"In the music community, support and admiration for Bruce Springsteen isn’t remotely a scoop; he’s long been admired by his peers and those he’s inspired. But Springsteen’s recent onstage comments in Manchester, England, about Donald Trump — calling the administration “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous” — and the increasingly authoritarian state of America have drawn the president’s ire. Trump even threatened a “major investigation” into Springsteen for his endorsement of Kamala Harris. In light of Trump’s attacks, a slew of musicians have publicly reaffirmed their support for the New Jersey legend. Here’s a rundown of a list that will surely continue to grow.\n\n Pearl Jam \n\n Springsteen’s brand of tradition-soaked rock & roll may have seemed the antithesis of punk and its offspring grunge when Pearl Jam launched in 1990. But any notion of an oil-and-water chemistry dissipated as early as 2004, when Eddie Vedder appeared onstage during a Springsteen and E Street Band show for a version of “Better Man.” A decade later, the two teamed up for a cover of AC/DC’s “Highway to Hell” during a Springsteen show in Australia.\n\n During Pearl Jam’s May 16 show in Pittsburgh, Vedder showed where he stood in the Bruce-vs.-Trump war by playing a version of Springsteen’s My City of Ruins.” Two days later, at the same venue, Vedder made his feelings even more evident, repeating some of Springsteen’s litany of Trump disruptions and Springsteen’s retorts (“That’s happening,” “That is also happening”). He continued, “Part of free speech is open discussion. Part of democracy is healthy public discourse. The name-calling is so beneath us. Bruce has always been as pro-American with his values and liberty, and his justice has always remained intact. And I’m saying this now to be sure this freedom to speak will still exist in a year or two when we come back to this microphone.”\n\n In case no one got the message even then, Vedder posted a photo on social media wearing a “United States vs. Bruce Springsteen” baseball cap.\n\n Robert Plant \n\n The same night Vedder spoke out in solidarity with Springsteen, the former Led Zeppelin frontman did something similar during a performance with his band Saving Grace at a show in Finland. “Right now in England, which is where we come from — not quite the land of the ice and snow — Bruce Springsteen is touring right now in the U.K. and he’s putting out some really serious stuff,” Plant told the crowd. “So tune in to him.” Addressing tensions between the U.K. and the U.S., Plant said, “Let’s all hope that we can be…” before going into a version of his former band’s “Friends.”\n\n Neil Young \n\n The Springsteen-Young mutual appreciation society dates back to at least the mid-Eighties, when Young, along with Crosby, Stills & Nash, took part in the first of Young and his late wife Pegi’s Bridge School benefit shows in California. Since then, they’ve shared a stage more than a few times, playing Young’s “Rockin’ in the Free World” and “Down by the River.”\n\n Addressing Trump directly, Young posted on his website on May 19: “Bruce and thousands of musicians think you are ruining America. You worry about that instead of the dyin’ kids in Gaza. That’s your problem. I am not scared of you. Neither are the rest of us. You shut down FEMA when we needed it most. That’s your problem Trump. STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING. Think about saving America from the mess you made. Taylor Swift is right. So is Bruce. You know how I feel.”\n\n It’s not the first time Young has gone after Trump: In 2020, he posted an open letter to the then first-time president, calling him “a disgrace to my country” and demanding Trump stop using “Rockin’ in the Free World” at rallies. Given that Trump was a fan at one point — he was in the audience at a CSNY reunion show in New York in 2006 — the pro-Bruce remarks may sting.\n\n Tom Morello \n\n Musically and politically, the former Rage Against the Machine guitarist shares plenty in common with Springsteen, down to joining the E Street band on their “High Hopes” tour in 2014. At the Boston Calling Music Festival on May 25, Morello told the crowd, “Bruce is going after Trump because Bruce, his whole life, he’s been about truth, justice, democracy, equality. And Trump is mad at him because Bruce draws a bigger audience. Fuck that guy.” Morello then played Springsteen’s “The Ghost of Tom Joad.”\n\n Mike Ness (Social Distortion) \n\n In a 2018 interview, Ness expressed surprise that Springsteen was an admirer of his band Social Distortion, whose influence is documented in the new book Tearing Down the Orange Curtain. “I became a Springsteen fan later on, much later,” Ness said. “I was not getting turned on to Springsteen when I was a kid. His live shows are what I really like. You know, we just kind of became friends. He was a big supporter of Social Distortion in the early Nineties. I was like, ‘How did this guy even hear of us?’”\n\n The two wound up on a few mutual stages, including a New York-area Social D show in 2019. At the Punk Rock Bowling Festival in Las Vegas on May 26, Ness made his admiration for Springsteen even more apparent, talking about how “freedoms being taken away from us” and adding, “I’m good friends with Bruce Springsteen…. All I’m saying is, pay attention.” He also told the crowd he had warned them in the past about “T-rump,” who is the “worst [president] we ever had.” (Watch at the 31:00 mark above.)\n\n The U2 singer and Springsteen also go way back, starting at least with Springsteen joining the Irish band onstage in Philadelphia in 1987. In 2002, Bono hopped onstage during a Springsteen Miami show for a version of “Because the Night,” and later on, Springsteen inducted U2 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\n\n Asked about the Trump back-and-forth by Jimmy Kimmel on May 27, Bono succinctly summed up whose side he was on: “There’s only one boss in America.”\n\n Jason Isbell \n\n The Americana singer-songwriter has never held his tongue when it comes to speaking out about political and social issues and has often cited Springsteen as an influence on his songwriting. So it’s no surprise that Isbell would be in Springsteen’s corner here. \n\n On social media, he planted his flag, and took a shot at Trump’s petulance, writing: “Just want to make sure everybody knows Bruce Springsteen is an incredibly nice and kind and generous dude who has made some of the greatest albums of all time and sorry big baby but there’s only one Boss.”","summary":"From Robert Plant to Pearl Jam, all the musicians who have rushed to the Boss's defense","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/springsteen-vs-trump-all-artists-supporting-bruce-1235349389/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Bruce-Support-System.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 19:32:09","author":"David Browne","authors":["David Browne"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.202},{"id":325882426,"title":"A Federal Judge Lists 8 Ways That Trump Violated the Constitution by Punishing a Disfavored Law Firm","text":"After President Donald Trump began penalizing major law firms that had offended him in one way or another last February, nine of them chose to surrender rather than fight. They agreed to humiliating concessions that included pro bono work, totaling nearly $1 billion, for causes favored by the president. But a handful of firms stood their ground, arguing that Trump's executive orders targeting them violated the First Amendment and undermined the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.\n\nSo far the latter approach has proven to be pragmatic as well as principled. Perkins Coie, Jenner & Block, Susman Godfrey, and WilmerHale have obtained court orders barring Trump from abusing his authority to punish law firms for representing his political opponents, supporting causes he does not like, or employing attorneys who have crossed him. The latest example, a permanent injunction that a federal judge in Washington, D.C., issued on Tuesday, underlines the threat posed by Trump's petty vindictiveness. In an opinion peppered with exclamation points, U.S. District Judge Richard J. Leon says Trump's order against WilmerHale defies the First Amendment in four ways, violates the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of due process in two ways, unconstitutionally interferes with the right to legal representation, and flouts the separation of powers.\n\n\"The cornerstone of the American system of justice is an independent judiciary and an independent bar willing to tackle unpopular cases, however daunting,\" Leon writes. \"In the nearly 250 years since the Constitution was adopted no Executive Order has been issued challenging these fundamental rights. Now, however, several Executive Orders have been issued directly challenging these rights and that independence. One of these Orders is the subject of this case. For the reasons set forth below, I have concluded that this Order must be struck down in its entirety as unconstitutional.\"\n\nIn his March 27 order targeting WilmerHale, Trump complained that the firm had \"engage[d] in obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends.\" He was alluding to WilmerHale's work for the Democratic National Committee, state-level Democratic organizations, and the presidential campaigns of two Democrats: Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Trump said WilmerHale was \"bent on employing lawyers who weaponize the prosecutorial power to upend the democratic process and distort justice,\" mentioning former Special Counsel Robert Mueller, who investigated Trump, and two of \"his colleagues.\"\n\nWilmerHale had engaged in \"egregious conduct\" by \"support[ing] efforts to discriminate on the basis of race,\" Trump averred, referring to the firm's defense of Harvard University's affirmative action practices against a successful challenge by Students for Fair Admissions. He also accused WilmerHale of supporting \"the obstruction of efforts to prevent illegal aliens from committing horrific crimes and trafficking deadly drugs within our borders,\" by which he meant that the firm had challenged some of his immigration policies during his first term. He added that WilmerHale \"furthers the degradation of the quality of American elections, including by supporting efforts designed to enable noncitizens to vote.\" That was a reference to the firm's involvement in challenges to state voter identification and registration laws.\n\nAs Leon notes, WilmerHale also has irked Trump by representing \"inspectors general alleging that President Trump improperly fired them\" and the House Ways and Means Committee in \"litigation resulting in President Trump's disclosure of his personal tax returns.\" And the firm challenged a fantasy close to Trump's heart by opposing his lawsuits \"challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election.\"\n\nBecause WilmerHale had engaged in \"conduct detrimental to critical American interests,\" Trump said, it was appropriate to \"suspend any active security clearances\" held by lawyers at the firm and restrict their access to federal buildings and government officials. He also ordered the termination of federal contracts with WilmerHale and a review of other contractors' links to the firm. And he threatened the firm with investigations for \"racial discrimination\" via \"diversity, equity, and inclusion\" (DEI) programs.\n\nThe day after Trump imposed those penalties, which posed a grave threat to WilmerHale's business, Leon issued a temporary restraining order against the president's edict. He noted that the First Amendment prohibits government retaliation for constitutionally protected speech, including \"retaliatory actions based on perceived viewpoint.\" He added that \"the retaliatory nature of the Executive Order at issue here is clear on its face,\" and \"there is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm.\"\n\nLeon reiterates that point in Tuesday's ruling. WilmerHale's legal work is \"unquestionably protected conduct under the First Amendment,\" he notes. \"On its face,\" he says, Trump's order constitutes \"retaliation for the firm's protected speech,\" including its \"pro bono practice, 'obvious partisan representations to achieve political ends,' and involvement in immigration and election litigation.\"\n\nThe order imposes \"a kitchen sink of severe sanctions on WilmerHale for this protected conduct,\" Leon writes. \"Any one of those sanctions would cause clients to strongly reconsider their engagements with WilmerHale. Taken together, the provisions constitute a staggering punishment for the firm's protected speech! The Order is intended to, and does in fact, impede the firm's ability to effectively represent its clients! For example, WilmerHale attorneys may not be able to enter federal courthouses for trial, meet with federal regulators, or access classified materials necessary for working on national security matters.\"\n\nLeon notes that \"clients have already begun ending or curtailing their relationships with WilmerHale.\" In addition to the direct restrictions on the firm's work, the order's contracting provisions threatened \"severe economic consequences for the firm,\" he says. \"The impact of losing federal contractor clients would be staggering, as '[a]t least 21 of WilmerHale's 25 largest clients in 2024 have contracts with federal agencies. These 21 clients accounted for more than 30% of the Firm's revenue in 2024—nearly $500 million.'\"\n\nWilmerHale also alleged that Trump's order violated the First Amendment by discriminating against particular viewpoints. Leon agrees. \"WilmerHale's representation of clients in litigation is speech,\" he says. \"The Order attacks the viewpoints WilmerHale expressed over the course of these representations, describing WilmerHale's work as 'partisan' and 'political,' and maligning WilmerHale's advocacy on behalf of causes disfavored by President Trump.\" It \"both threatens and imposes sanctions and uses other means of coercion to suppress WilmerHale's representation of disfavored causes and clients.\"\n\nThe First Amendment also guarantees the right to \"petition the government for a redress of grievances.\" Leon says Trump's order blatantly violates that right as well.\n\n\"WilmerHale has both alleged and shown that the Order violates the Petition Clause by (1) punishing the firm for its past representation of clients in litigation and (2) undermining the firm's ability to pursue litigation in the future,\" Leon writes. \"The Order explicitly targets WilmerHale at least in part for the litigation it has pursued, including election and immigration lawsuits.\" In addition to \"punishing WilmerHale for past petitioning,\" he notes, the order \"creates hurdles to prevent the firm from pursuing future lawsuits\" by revoking security clearances and restricting access to federal buildings and agencies, which \"would severely hinder WilmerHale's ability to effectively bring cases.\"\n\nLeon is not impressed by Trump's invocation of national security. \"Other than a passing reference to WilmerHale's involvement in election and immigration litigation, the Order does not explain how WilmerHale's conduct has threatened national security or how restricting its access to federal buildings or federal employees would remedy those threats,\" he writes. Rather, the order is \"plainly motivated by the President's desire to retaliate against WilmerHale for its protected activity,\" which is \"not a legitimate Government interest.\"\n\nThe First Amendment also has long been understood to protect freedom of association. \"Compelled disclosure of affiliation with groups engaged in advocacy can violate this First Amendment right,\" Leon notes. \"WilmerHale alleges that the Order compels the firm's federal contractor clients to disclose their affiliation with WilmerHale, which engages in advocacy on their behalf and on behalf of other clients. I find that this disclosure violates the First Amendment [right to] freedom of association.\"\n\nRegarding WilmerHale's Fifth Amendment claims, Leon notes that the firm has \"a protected liberty interest in its right to petition the Government under the First Amendment.\" WilmerHale \"has shown that the Government deprived the firm of this protected liberty interest,\" he writes, and Trump \"issued the Order without any due process.\"\n\nThe order also violates due process because it is unconstitutionally vague, failing to provide \"fair notice of conduct that is forbidden or required,\" Leon says. The order \"does not provide WilmerHale with notice of how it should act in the future to avoid these sanctions,\" he notes. \"The Order's invocation of concepts such as 'bedrock American principles' and 'the interests of the United States' leave WilmerHale and its employees guessing about how to modify their conduct to avoid the Order's sanctions….The Order essentially leaves it to WilmerHale to predict which causes and which attorneys the President personally dislikes and then steer clear of those causes and attorneys. This chilling effect triggers serious vagueness concerns.\"\n\nTrump's instructions to his underlings are also alarmingly vague, Leon says. The order \"directs agency officials to take action against WilmerHale to ensure 'consistency' with the 'national interest,' 'the goals and priorities of [the] Administration,' and 'the interests of the United States,'\" he writes. \"Read in the context of the Order, these phrases are most narrowly construed to mean those interests which the President condones or, in their broadest construction, whatever an agency head thinks is in the interest of the American people. To say the least, the Order is fraught with the risk of arbitrary or discriminatory enforcement!\"\n\nWilmerHale also cited the Sixth Amendment, which guarantees criminal defendants the right to \"have the assistance of counsel.\" Leon says WilmerHale \"has alleged and shown that the Order 'infringes the Sixth Amendment right to counsel of [its] clients' by 'eviscerat[ing] the Firm's ability to provide effective representation and advocacy.'\"\n\nSince WilmerHale's criminal defense work \"requires entering federal buildings and engaging with federal employees,\" Leon notes, the order \"effectively prevents the firm's attorneys from representing their clients in criminal matters.\" It also \"coerces WilmerHale's federal contractor clients to choose between their contracts and their engagements—including engagements on criminal matters—with WilmerHale.\"\n\nThose restrictions \"may thus cause the firm's criminal defendant clients to abandon the firm and seek alternate counsel,\" and \"some clients have already begun to do so,\" Leon notes. Although the order \"does not directly prohibit criminal defendants from hiring WilmerHale as their counsel,\" he says, \"it certainly has that effect!\" According to the Supreme Court, he notes, \"indirect infringements on the right to counsel of choice can violate the Sixth Amendment,\" and \"the indirect infringement on the right to counsel here is severe.\"\n\nFinally, Leon concludes that Trump's order \"violates the separation of powers by usurping judicial authority to identify and sanction abuses of the judicial process.\" Even if \"each section could be grounded in Executive power, the directives set out in each section clearly exceed that power!\" he says. \"The President, by issuing the Order, is wielding his authority to punish a law firm for engaging in litigation conduct the President personally disfavors. Thus, to the extent the President does have the power to limit access to federal buildings, suspend and revoke security clearances, dictate federal hiring, and manage federal contracts, the Order surpasses that authority and in fact usurps the Judiciary's authority to resolve cases and sanction parties that come before the courts!\"\n\nFederal judges have reached similar conclusions in response to lawsuits filed by Perkins Coie, which obtained a permanent injunction on May 2; Jenner & Block, which obtained a permanent injunction on May 23; and Susman Godfrey, which last month obtained a temporary restraining order and is now seeking a permanent injunction. This string of successes makes the capitulations by firms such as Paul Weiss, Skadden, and Latham & Watkins, which sought to assuage the president's wrath by changing their policies and practices, look unwise as well as cowardly.\n\nAmong other things, those firms agreed to abandon DEI programs and devote huge amounts of pro bono resources to Trump-favored clients and causes. Trump has \"hinted\" that he views those promised services as \"a legal war chest to be used as he wishes,\" The New York Times reported last month. Citing \"two people briefed on the matter,\" the Times said the options include \"sending the lawyers to help Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency,\" \"deploying them to aid the Justice Department,\" or even assigning them to represent \"Mr. Trump or his allies if they [become] ensnared in investigations.\"","summary":"The president's crusade against attorneys whose work offends him, which defies the First Amendment and undermines the right to counsel, has resulted in a series of judicial rebukes.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/05/28/a-federal-judge-lists-8-ways-that-trump-violated-the-constitution-by-punishing-a-disfavored-law-firm/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-5-28-25-Newscom-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 19:15:17","author":"Jacob Sullum","authors":["Jacob Sullum"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.21},{"id":325893842,"title":"MSNBC's Jonathan Capehart claims 'Obama people' are crowding out 'next generation' of Democratic Party leaders","text":"MSNBC anchor Jonathan Capehart argued that former President Barack Obama's influence over the Democratic Party has sometimes been stifling for a younger generation of leaders who seek to shape the future of the party. \"The Obama people come in, they’re the new blood, and now people are starting to complain, ‘Oh my God, the Obama people, they’re running everything.’ Some of the criticism, I think, is valid,\" Capehart said, referencing complaints that Obama-era staffers had of former President Bill Clinton's advisors dominating party politics. Despite Obama's entrance into national politics coming almost 20 years ago, his influence on the Democratic Party, especially through his former campaign staffers and advisors, only seems to have grown. Obama campaign alums, including Mitch Stewart and Rufus Gifford, also worked on former President Biden's campaign, according to NBC News. Other Obama campaign alums helped lead former Vice President Kamala Harris' failed presidential bid. DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS QUESTION INFLUENCE OF OBAMA-ERA CAMPAIGN OPERATIVES IN PARTY'S FUTURE Capehart argued the persistent influence of Obama alums throughout the campaign world has also created an arrogance among the Obama \"class\" of political advisors. \"Sometimes you get a sense that they think they know everything, they run the world, and in some cases you can understand it because, well, they did win two presidential elections,\" the MSNBC anchor said of Obama's staffers.

They don’t have the feel for it because they’re not from that generation,\" he said. Capehart said Obama has intentionally made himself \"scarce\" because some Democrats expect that he will \"save the day.\" \"I think that’s one of the primary reasons why I think President Obama has been scarce, is that everyone’s looking for him to save the day. And what they keep saying is, ‘No, no, no, no, it’s not about us. It’s about you.’ And it seems like the party can’t seem to come to grips with that and deal with that,\" Capehart said.

Why don't you look at that?\"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), \"studies have shown that there is no link between receiving vaccines and developing autism spectrum disorder.\" However, there are still many vaccines skeptics in the United States, and the recent rise in measles cases—which was once considered eradicated in the U.S.—has been linked to anti-vaccine sentiment.\"They'll never let that secret out. That may be the key behind all the defunding everything,\" Michelle Obama said. \"Then old men can keep marrying 20-year-olds. It's like, 'I'll give you the baby you want.'\"The former first lady then turned to her podcast crew and said: \"We don't have to keep that in.\"Michelle Obama shared that the \"frustrating thing\" about protecting women's reproductive health is that \"it has been reduced to a question of choice, as if that's all of what women's health is.\"In the November 2024 election, Republican president Donald Trump was victorious over his Democratic rival, former vice president Kamala Harris. Ahead of the election, Michelle Obama supported Harris.\"I attempted to make the argument on the campaign trail this past election that there's just so much more at stake because so many men have no idea what women go through,\" the attorney said. \"We haven't been researched, we haven't been considered, and it still affects the way a lot of men lawmakers, a lot of male politicians, a lot of male religious leaders think about the issue of choice, as if it's just about the fetus, the baby.\"Michelle Obama explained: \"Women's reproductive health is about our life. It's about this whole complicated reproductive system that the least of what it does is produce life. It's a very important thing that it does, but you only produce life if the machine that's producing it—if you want to whittle us down to a machine—if the machine is functioning in a healthy, streamlined kind of way. But there is no discussion or apparent connection between the two.\"Malone added that \"one of the things that is disturbing\" is that the \"government has gotten involved in decisions that are personal and healthcare decisions. It's not just about whether someone chooses to have a pregnancy or not, but this is a situation where a woman should have control over her body—when and if to have a baby, and to decide how that pregnancy should continue.\" Trump was inaugurated in January, and in his first 100 days in office, the 78-year-old made several moves surrounding reproductive health including pardoning anti-abortion protesters and announcing mass layoffs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.What People Are SayingIMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson's YouTube page posted Malone's episode on Wednesday, and people praised the discussion in the comments.YouTube user @runako2013 wrote: \"Thank u for this!

One, to be the company of Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé, and Oprah — I’ll play tambourine in that band. And two, U2 and I have never paid or played a show to support any candidate from any party. It has never happened.”\n\n The Grammy-winning musician noted that, for a platform called Truth Social, “it seems to be pretty antisocial,” adding, “It’s not very true a lot of the time.”\n\n However, Bono suggested that a “clue” as to why he was being lumped in with the other A-listers currently receiving flak from the president “might be the fact that I co-founded the One Campaign, which is, by design, bipartisan.”\n\n The nonprofit organization states on its website that it aims to advocate “for the investments needed to create economic opportunities and healthier lives in Africa,” including quality education, gender equality, and protection from preventable diseases. \n\n \"We’ve got a lot of very religious Catholics, Evangelicals, Conservatives who are very, very, very angry with the person that they voted into office having demolished instruments of mercy and compassion like USAID [United States Agency for International Development] or PEPFAR [United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief], which can save 26 million lives of people who have AIDS around the world,\" Bono continued. \"That’s the America that we love. That’s the America that we all want to be part of. And they are not happy, and there will be trouble.”\n\n Trump and Springsteen’s spat began when the “Dancing in the Dark” singer dubbed the current administration “corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous” during the opening night of his Land of Hope and Dreams tour in Manchester earlier this month.\n\n “Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us,\" Springsteen said, \"Raise your voices against the authoritarianism, and let freedom ring.\"\n\n The president fired back at the musician a day later on Truth Social, calling him a “dried-out ‘prune’ of a rocker” and stating that he “never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics.” \n\n Speaking about Springsteen, who currently has 20 Grammys under his belt, Trump continued, “He’s not a talented guy — just a pushy, obnoxious JERK who fervently supported Crooked Joe Biden, a mentally incompetent FOOL, and our WORST EVER President, who came close to destroying our Country.\"\n\n Watch Bono discuss Trump in the clip above.","summary":"\"U2 and I have never paid or played a show to support any candidate from any party,\" he said. \"It has never happened.\"","url":"https://ew.com/bono-reacts-to-trump-saying-u2-got-paid-to-support-kamala-harris-bruce-springsteen-drama-11743047","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/KAipry6xIaap2WYfcbR0O2gwIHM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Bono-Donald-Trump-Bruce-Springsteen-052825-8293f791a96c40fc9059cc0466976209.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 16:28:53","author":"Emlyn Travis","authors":["Emlyn Travis"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.06},{"id":325882444,"title":"Exclusive — Senate Republican Campaign Arm: $20 Million 'Won't Be Enough' for Democrats to Figure Out How to Appeal to Young Men","text":"The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) on Wednesday released an ad mocking Democrats for spending $20 million to figure out how to appeal to young men, citing Sen.

The primary underscores intraparty fractures for Republicans and could have key implications for the general election.Although Republicans are viewed as favored in the Texas election, Democrats are hoping to make it competitive next November, as they need to flip seats in at least two states Trump won by double digits to secure a Senate majority. But Texas has been reliably Republican for decades; and its leftward drift in the 2010s was reversed in the 2024 election, when Trump performed stronger than in the 2016 or 2020 election in the Lone Star State.What to KnowPaxton has established an early polling lead against Cornyn in several recent surveys of primary voters, including in a new poll released this week by Texas State University's Barbara Jordan Public Policy Research and Survey Center.The poll found that a plurality of Republican primary voters are inclined to support Paxton, but many still remain undecided about how they will vote next year.In a two-way race, 43 percent of respondents said they would vote for Paxton compared to 34 percent who would vote for Cornyn. An additional 23 percent said they are unsure of how they would vote.If Representative Wesley Hunt, who has been speculated to be a potential candidate, joins Paxton and Cornyn, he would receive 15 percent of the vote, the poll found. In that scenario, 34 percent of Republicans would vote for Paxton and 27 percent would support Cornyn. Twenty-four percent were still undecided.A Trump endorsement could be critical for the race. Nearly half—49 percent—of Republicans said his endorsement would make him more likely to vote for a candidate. He has not made an endorsement yet.The poll surveyed 1,200 Texas registered voters from May 9 to May 19, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.How Competitive Will Texas Senate Race Be? What Poll ShowsThe poll suggested the race could be decided by the single digits, regardless of who becomes the Republican nominee.The closest scenario involved Paxton versus former Representative Colin Allred, the Democrat who unsuccessfully challenged Senator Ted Cruz in the 2024 Senate race. Paxton led Allred by two points (48 percent to 46 percent). Some Democrats have floated Allred as a viable candidate for 2026, as he performed stronger than former Vice President Kamala Harris in the Lone Star State.Paxton also held a 3-point lead over Representative Joaquin Castro and a 4-point lead over former Representative Beto O'Rourke.Hunt held a 3-point lead over Allred and 6-point leads over Castro and O'Rourke. Cornyn led Allred by four points, O'Rourke by 6 points and Castro by 7 points, according to the survey.Texas Could Be Critical 2026 Senate Race—Here's WhyDemocrats have talked about flipping Texas for years, but the state has proven elusive for the party, which has no choice but to target double-digit Trump seats next year if it wants to overcome a difficult Senate map to win a majority.Maine, which Harris won, and North Carolina, which Trump won by only 3 points, are Democrats' top targets next year as they also defend seats in Trump-won Georgia and Michigan. But there are no other obvious flip opportunities next year—meaning they have to win two Republican-leaning states. Alaska, Florida, Iowa, Ohio and Texas are viewed as the most viable states for Democrats, though Republicans are still favored in each of those races.While Republicans held a lead in every matchup of this poll, others have suggested Allred could lead Paxton in a hypothetical race.Texas backed Trump by about 14 points last November, despite him winning the state by fewer than 6 points four years earlier. Cornyn last won reelection in 2020 by about 10 points against Democrat M.J. Hegar.What People Are SayingCornyn campaign senior adviser Matt Mackowiak told Newsweek on Wednesday: \"When Texas GOP primary voters fully understand Ken Paxton's record of mismanagement, ethical failings and poor judgment, we are confident we will win this primary.\"Newsweek also reached out to the Paxton campaign for comment via email.Paxton on X, formerly Twitter, on April 9: \"For years, John Cornyn has betrayed President Trump and the America First movement. Texas deserves better, and that's why I'm running for U.S. Senate.\"President Donald Trump told reporters last month: \"I like Paxton, I like Cornyn, they're both good people. So, I'll make a decision somewhere along the line. But you have two very good men.\"What Happens NextIt is yet to be seen whether Allred or a different Democrat jump into the Texas Senate race or if other candidates like Hunt could also run on the Republican side. The Cook Political Report classifies the race as Solid Republican, meaning it is \"not considered competitive\" nor \"likely to become closely contested.\"","summary":"A new poll revealed how competitive the 2026 Texas Senate primary could be.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ken-paxton-cahnces-toppling-john-cornyn-texas-poll-senate-2078028","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2652748/texas-senate-primary-poll-republicans.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 15:59:43","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.464},{"id":325841632,"title":"Lara Trump rebuffs Tapper’s apology to her over Biden decline: ‘Damage is done’","text":"“We were so close to something so dangerous happening to this country.

Leon of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia struck down President Donald Trump's executive order targeting the law firm WilmerHale. \"Judges have already rejected similarly punitive executive orders aimed at the firms Perkins Coie and Jenner & Block, and lawyers representing Susman Godfrey asked a fourth judge earlier this month to issue a final decision in their case,\" notes The New York Times, but many firms—Willkie Farr & Gallagher; Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom; Milbank; Kirkland & Ellis; Latham & Watkins; A&O Shearman; Simpson Thacher & Bartlett; and Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft—have struck deals with the administration, typically forcing them to provide a certain amount of pro bono legal work related to causes that the Trump administration supports.\n\nWilmerHale originally attracted Trump's attention because it had represented \"inspectors general alleging that President Trump improperly fired them; the House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means in litigation resulting in President Trump's disclosure of his personal tax returns; the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaigns in election litigation; and the Democratic National Committee and state-level Democratic Party organizations in lawsuits brought by the Donald Trump campaign challenging the results of the 2020 presidential election,\" reads the ruling.

Lawyers with the firm would have been banned from entering any and all federal buildings—including courthouses.\n\n\"In his opinion, Judge Leon colorfully dismissed assertions by the government that its targeting of WilmerHale was something routine and apolitical, brushing off the notion with a brusque 'please—that dog won't hunt!'\" per The New York Times. \n\n\"Taken together, the provisions constitute a staggering punishment for the firm's protected speech,\" reads the ruling. \"The order is intended to, and does in fact, impede the firm's ability to effectively represent its clients! For example, WilmerHale attorneys may not be able to enter federal courthouses for trial, meet with federal regulators, or access classified materials necessary for working on national security matters.\"\n\nIt's a pretty blunt dismissal of Trump's attempt to wield the power of the state against a disfavored law firm.

I can’t get those thoughts out of my mind.”\nSiegel isn’t just talking about the physical and psychological abuse he was subjected to by his captors or the suffocating conditions and malnutrition he faced in tunnels deep underground. He’s also terrified that Israel’s intensifying bombardment and ground offensive will kill the remaining living hostages – or drive Hamas to execute them.\nHamas and other militant groups kidnapped 251 people from Israel during the October 7, 2023 terror attacks.\nAs Israel marks 600 days since the war began, Siegel and dozens of former hostages and relatives are renewing their call for a deal that will end the conflict and secure the release of all 58 still held captive, living and dead.

Trump Squabble: ‘There’s Only One Boss in America’","text":"For the record, Bono said he has never endorsed a politician for office. But when Jimmy Kimmel asked him on Tuesday night (May 27) where he stood in the ongoing, escalating battle between Donald Trump and Bruce Springsteen, the socially conscious U2 singer said there was only one endorsement he could possibly give. \n\n bono-jimmy-kimmel-live-still-2025-billboard-1548\"I think there’s only one ‘Boss’ in America,” the Irish rock legend responded cheekily in reference to Springsteen’s longtime nickname. The dig at the president came after a recent late night Truth Social rant in which Trump called for a “major investigation” into celebrities who supported former vice president Kamala Harris in her White House bid. “HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” Trump wrote. “WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN’T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? …AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO???”\n\n According to Newsweek, there is no official record of any of those artist being paid to perform in support of Harris. In addition, Irish citizen Bono did not endorse a candidate in the 2024 U.S. presidential election and did not participate in any campaign events.\n\n That said, Bono was more than happy to be included in the Trump dump. “To be in the company of Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé and Oprah, I’d play tambourine in that band,” he told Kimmel, clarifying that neither he nor U2 have ever “paid or played a show to support any candidate from any party. It has never happened. It’s called ‘Truth Social,’ but it seems to be very antisocial and it’s not very true,” he quipped about the president’s social media platform.\n\n He did, however, suspect that his name may have made it into Trump’s rant because he co-founded the non-profit One Campaign, a global non-partisan organization that has raised millions to create economic opportunities in Africa. In the midst of the Trump administration’s unprecedented dismantling of U.S. government agencies — including efforts to completely defund and eliminated the U.S. Agency for International Development — Bono noted that people across the political spectrum, including the many “very religious Catholics and evangelicals and conservatives” who support his organization are “very, very, very angry with the person that they voted into office having demolished instruments of mercy and compassion, like USAID or PEPFAR,” he said.\n\n The latter is a reference to a global initiative launched by Republican President George W. Bush in 2003 that is credited to date with saving 26 million lives of people living with AIDS and and allowing nearly 8 million babies to be born with HIV infection. “They are not happy and there will be trouble,” Bono predicted of the blow-back from Trump’s actions. \n\n While he was happy to weigh in on the American pop-litical back-and-forth, Bono was actually there to promote his new biographical film, Bono: Stories of Surrender, which premieres on Apple TV+ on Friday (May 30). In a rare TV chat appearance, the singer jokingly said the memoir-tuned-one-man-show-turned-film has him playing an “aging rock star on a massive ego trip… It’s quite a stretch.”\n\n He briefly described how the film had him exploring his “rather complicated” relationship with his strong-willed late father, Brendan Robert Hewson, as well as his own struggles to be a good father and son. When Kimmel noted that the film got a nearly 9-minute ovation at its Cannes Film Festival debut, Bono, despite being one of the world’s biggest rock stars, admitted to feeling a sense of imposter syndrome while walking the red carpet at the glamorous French film fête. \n\n In fact, he was somewhat unnerved to even sit with Kimmel, asking actress daughter Eve Hewson (Bad Sisters) for advice, which she dutifully provided. “‘Dad, just bring it,'” she counseled the 65-year-old music legend. “And I’m like, ‘bring what?,'” he replied. “She said, ‘it. It. Just answer Jimmy’s questions. None of the jazz conversation without full stops and commas. Just answer his question, no false modesty.'”\n\n Sage advice indeed. So, when Kimmel asked what’s next for U2, Bono gave a somewhat jazz-less answer. “Oh, oh yes,” Bono said in response to a query about whether the band is recording new music. “We’ve been in a studio. I think you’ve sometimes got to deal with the past to get to the present… in order to make the sound of the future.”\n\n Bono described the sound as that of “four men who feel like their lives depend on it,” noting that “nobody needs a new U2 album unless it’s an extraordinary one. And I’m feeling very strong about it.” The unnamed album would be the follow-up to 2023’s Songs of Surrender, which featured re-recorded versions of 40 of the group’s previously released tracks. \n\n Pumping up the jazz, Bono said the new tracks are songs for the “kitchen… the speedway, the garage… just for every part of your life. Songs to make up to, songs to break up to.” The best news is that drummer Larry Mullen Jr. is back in the fold following neck surgery that kept him out of U2’s residency at Las Vegas’ Sphere in late 2023 and early 2024. “He’s really innovative,” Bono said of the band’s time keeper.\n\n Watch Bono on Jimmy Kimmel Live! below.","summary":"The U2 singer also revealed that the full band is in the studio working on their next album.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/bono-talks-springsteen-vs-trump-kimmel-one-boss-in-america-1235982404/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bono-jimmy-kimmel-live-still-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 12:22:37","author":"Gil Kaufman","authors":["Gil Kaufman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.073},{"id":325747360,"title":"‘Truth Teller’ Bruce Springsteen Slimes Trump as Treasonous","text":"When Donald Trump is president, it’s considered dangerously authoritarian if he accuses someone of treason—and it’s considered heroic “truth-telling” when you accuse Trump of being a treasonous authoritarian.\n\nThe latest exhibit is leftist rock star/first-rate tax evader Bruce Springsteen. On a concert stage in Manchester, England, Bruce went full Dixie Chicks by attacking the president on a European stage.\n\n“In my home, the America I love, the America I’ve written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” Springsteen declared. “Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism, and let freedom ring.”\n\nWait several drumbeats and out came The Washington Post, with a laudatory article by pop music critic Chris Richards. The headline blared: “Bruce Springsteen is fighting for the America he sings about: On a powerful new live recording, the rock legend isn’t warning us about approaching authoritarianism. ‘This is happening now.’”\n\nThis is what liberal journalists do. When they fail in their mission to elect Democrats, then democracy is vanishing. When Trump attacks the liberal media and seeks to deprive it of government subsidies, the “authoritarianism” is happening. That’s funny—many voters feel that using government money to push for a permanently Democrat-run government is anti-democracy.\n\nBut at the Post, democracy is always dying in darkness when Trump’s in charge. Richards began the piece: “When Bruce Springsteen described the Trump administration as ‘corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous’ from a concert stage in England last week, there was no need to gasp. Springsteen is a truth teller.”\n\nRichards ended the piece with the same crusading tone: Springsteen’s messaging “confirms that we’re not talking about corruption, incompetence, and treason in some vague future tense. This isn’t a rock star’s paranoid ramble about a still-forming authoritarianism. If you’ve ever believed this man, believe him now.”\n\nThe Post’s front-page motto could be “Paranoid rambling about Trump since 2015.”\n\nIn between these grand proclamations, Richards put on his “fact-checking” hat: “On Monday, without evidence, Trump posted on social media that Springsteen, Beyonce, and Bono were paid by Kamala Harris to appear at her 2024 presidential campaign events.”\n\nWithout evidence? Shortly after Trump’s message, The New York Times offered some facts: “Ms. Harris paid $1 million to Ms. Winfrey’s production company for a livestreamed town hall in Detroit, according to campaign-finance records.” It wasn’t a “personal fee” for Oprah, so it somehow doesn’t count.\n\nLikewise, the Times found “Beyonce headlined a rally for Ms. Harris in her hometown of Houston for an abortion-rights event, and Ms. Harris’s campaign paid the singer’s company $165,000 in November for ‘campaign event production.’” Everyone was led to believe Beyonce would sing, but she did not. She did get a check.\n\nThe Times also said “no records available yet show any payment from Ms. Harris’s campaign” to Springsteen. He endorsed Harris in a video, not on a rally stage. But nobody was fact-checking Springsteen when he claimed the Harris-Walz ticket represented the “working class,” as if Bidenomics was terrific for average Americans.\n\nForbes estimates that Springsteen is a billionaire, since he sold his music catalog for about a half-billion dollars in 2021. But he will sit in a diner and put on a plaid jacket and play himself up as an aw-shucks commoner when he endorses inflation-inflaming Democrats for president. That’s not exactly “truth-telling.” It’s about as authentic as his sketchy tax returns.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The incident remains under investigation.\n\n“The U.S. Secret Service is aware of an on-duty altercation that occurred between two Uniformed Division officers at approximately 2.30 a.m. on May 21,” they said. “The individuals involved were suspended from duty and this matter is the subject of an internal investigation.” \n\n“The Secret Service has a very strict code of conduct for all employees and any behavior that violates that code is unacceptable,” the spokesperson added. \n\nThe federal law enforcement agency declined to comment further about the incident. \n\nAfter leaving office, former presidents and their spouses receive lifelong Secret Service protection. \n\nIn 1994, Congress enacted a measure to limit protection for former presidents and their spouses to ten years after they left office, as a cost-saving measure. Obama restored the lifelong protection in 2013. \n\nIt marks the latest alleged incident involving on-duty Secret Service officers, following the removal of an agent from former Vice President Kamala Harris’s security detail in April last year. \n\nMichelle Herczeg allegedly became angered after being laid off by her supervisor, causing Herczeg to throw items, including a menstrual pad, and attack her superior. \n\nThe Independent has contacted the Secret Service and the Obamas’ office for more information.","summary":"One agent from the former president’s security detail allegedly asked for a supervisor to come down ‘immediately before I whoop this girl’s a**’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/secret-service-obama-brawl-washington-dc-b2759082.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/28/9/57/GettyImages-2182720628.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/L2HWYFrd-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-28 10:42:53","author":"James Liddell","authors":["James Liddell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.535},{"id":325722018,"title":"Springsteen’s Quisling Concert","text":"Bruce Springsteen’s May 14 concert in Manchester, England, part of his “Land of Hopes and Dreams” world tour, included a reverse-ambassador speech: “The majority of our elected representatives have failed to protect the American people from the abuse of an unfit president and a rogue government.”\n\nStepping out of his lane as an entertainer, Springsteen appealed to anti-American interests (video clips captured a pathetic smattering of applause from the Brit audience, which is undergoing its own social crises), in the form of perverse Americana. He transgressed the emotional — nationalistic — sentiment of his music’s working-class subject matter. Springsteen violates the formerly compelling romanticism of Born to Run, his 1975 breakout album. (We should have known better when he traded that in 1984 for the faux-Americana of Born in the U.S.A.)\n\nWhat could move a popular artist to risk his popularity this way? The blue-collar pretense of millionaire Springsteen indulges blue-state politics. That stance can have a particular effect on home turf, but when Springsteen takes a particularly hateful partisanship abroad, it’s not rock ’n’ roll; it goes beyond citizenship or fellow-feeling and becomes dangerous adversarial posturing.\n\nSpeaking of the “majority of elected representatives,” he said, “They have no concern or idea of what it means to be deeply American.” This is Hanoi Jane Fonda stuff, fueled by a self-righteousness that is indifferent to the damage it causes overseas and the shame and hurt it inflicts back home.\n\n“The America that I’ve sung to you about for 50 years is real and regardless of its faults is a great country with great people.” That’s when his ugly-American calumny turned to blather. Springsteen’s attack on the current presidential administration wasn’t exactly in violation of the Logan Act, but in his effort to persuade foreigners, he did portray the U.S. negatively. It resembled those resentful statements Michelle Obama makes on her psychodrama podcast IMO — as if speaking “in my opinion” exempts anti-American speech from being taken politically. Springsteen’s own 2021 podcast with Barack Obama, Renegades: Born in the USA, shows the wealthy titans (leaning back, casually crossing their legs before cameras and microphones) feigning humbler-than-you kinship.\n\nThe politically strident Springsteen on view in Manchester abandoned his old, rollicking, common-man ambitions, as if convinced (by Obama, perhaps) that he could manipulate that schmaltz into international political force. The speech got worse:\n\nThe mighty E Street Band is here tonight to call upon the righteous power of art, of music, of rock ’n’ roll, in dangerous times. . . . The America I love, the America I’ve written about, and has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration. Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experience to rise with us, raise your voices against the authoritarianism, and let freedom ring.\n\nDoes New Jersey’s demagogue “Boss” know what “democracy” or “authoritarianism” actually mean? Praising America while talking against it sings from the Biden Fake Book. From there, Springsteen shifted into blatant partisan talking points:\n\nThere’s some very weird, strange, and dangerous sh*t going on out there right now. In America, they are persecuting people for using their right to free speech and voicing their dissent. . . . They are abandoning our great allies and siding with dictators against those struggling for their freedom.\n\nSpringsteen left out key facts about global invasion, illegal aliens, Ukrainian-war money laundering, and election interference. Never answering for his implicit endorsement of the Biden regime and campaigning for Kamala Harris, he made generalized DNC-style accusations: “They’re removing residents off American streets and without due process of law are deporting them to foreign detention centers and prisons. This is all happening now.”\n\nThis is worse than the Dixie Chicks in Europe attacking George W. Bush during the Iraq War, largely because the Dixie Chicks were D-list celebs whose music never mattered to me. But Springsteen had reenergized his homeboy career in the late 1970s with the superb Darkness on the Edge of Town, which was so recognizably, agonizingly personal that it felt truly American. Back then, Springsteen acknowledged a spiritual drive and ambivalence that went deeper than politics. Since then, he’s gotten richer and gone shallow.\n\nDarkness was released during the period when British punk rock enlivened pop music’s social consciousness. But Brits didn’t go to foreign lands and berate their home turf. Springsteen does precisely that because he mistakes youthful dissent with moral righteousness — the narcissism of the Village Voice, Rolling Stone magazine, and today’s legacy media.\n\nThis media revolt — including Springsteen’s own — betrays its audience, using borrowed, group-think enthusiasms and unsophisticated rhetoric. When Springsteen complains about implicit, conservative “ideological demands,” he disregards that rock ’n’ roll liberalism is also ideological.\n\nSpringsteen has recorded some unfortunate songs, including “My Hometown,” and “We Take Care of Our Own” (the latter atrocity worthy of future analysis), but nothing so offensive as this European speech. His trite bromides are typical of showbiz cretins struggling to appear principled. This hackneyed stance has turned his concert performances shrill and hollow.\n\nFormer defenders might wonder how pop romanticism became pseudo-political. Artists such as Pete Townshend and Kid Rock lament Springsteen’s fall, but they forget how even the great Darkness album ran head-on into the shock of political consciousness — as expressed by Elvis Costello’s Armed Forces, on which the song “Green Shirt,” going beyond Springsteen’s naïveté, warned about “the Quisling clinic,” a reference to Vidkun Quisling in World War II history that analogizes social conformity to showbiz sedition. Costello neatly compressed the clichés of political pop. Whatever it is that drives Quisling Springsteen to bash America overseas, his gaslighting rhetoric in patriotic guise stirs moral ambiguity, a devilish tactic of the enemy within.","summary":"Borrowed politics defeat a former rock-music hero.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/05/springsteens-quisling-concert/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/bruce-springsteen-manchester.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 10:30:25","author":"Armond White","authors":["Armond White"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":325747376,"title":"Kayleigh McEnany Makes Chilling Demand For ‘60 Minutes’ Reporter Over Anti-Trump Speech","text":"Fox News’ Greg Gutfeld and Kayleigh McEnany fumed over veteran CBS News reporter Scott Pelley’s recent commencement address at Wake Forest University, in which he slammed President Donald Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday’s episode of “The Five,” Gutfeld accused “60 Minutes” correspondent Pelley of “unloading his B.S. on 47.”\n\nGutfeld then turned to footage of Pelley warning students in the now-viral speech that, in Trump’s America, the rule of law, journalism and freedom of speech are all under attack.\n\nAfterward, Gutfeld pointed out: “He wasn’t arrested after that, you know.

By proxy, the first lady's top aide, Anthony Bernal, became one of the most influential people in the White House, Tapper and Thompson said in their new book about Biden's cognitive decline and the administration's alleged cover-up. \"He would not be welcome at my funeral,\" a longtime Biden aide told the authors. Operating in a White House anchored in loyalty, Bernal wielded loyalty as a weapon to weed out the defectors, Tapper and Thompson said.

Two aides, Bernal and Annie Tomasini, found their way into Joe and Jill Biden's pod, shifting the power dynamic of Biden's so-called \"Politiburo,\" the group of advisors who steered Biden's political orbit. Tapper and Thompson describe the \"intensely loyal\" duo as taking on an \"older-brother-and-little-sister vibe.\" Thompson even had the title of deputy campaign manager, which Tapper and Thompson said was \"unusual for a staffer to a spouse.\" The duo were the masterminds behind loading a teleprompter for Biden ahead of a local interview, a misstep that followed Biden's campaign. \"The significance of Bernal and Tomasini is the degree to which their rise in the Biden White House signaled the success of people whose allegiance was to the Biden family – not to the presidency, not to the American people, not to the country, but to the Biden theology,\" the authors wrote. Tapper and Thompson said it was difficult to find many Bernal defenders and described him as using his power to cast out \"potential heretics.\" As Bernal earned a reputation for trash-talking fellow aides, \"some even described him as the worst person they had ever met,\" Tapper and Thompson said. Bernal and Tomasini took on some of the residence staffers' roles in the White House. Tapper and Thompson said the aides \"had all-time access to the living quarters, with their White House badges reading ‘Res’ – uncommon for such aides.\" When the Biden campaign began gearing up for a re-election campaign and some voiced fears about his age or battleground state polling, Bernal and other senior staffers reacted dismissively about Vice President Kamala Harris launching a bid. Bernal is quoted in the book as having said, \"You don't run for four years – you run for eight.\" \"He had already begun planning the first lady's 2025 international travel schedule,\" Tapper and Thompson said. Bernal worked overtime to elevate Jill Biden's \"profile and glamour,\" freely criticizing her looks and outfits and even calling her \"Jill,\" according to the authors. Jill Biden and Bernal worked in tandem, keeping score of \"who was with them and against them.\" The book described the first lady as \"one of the chief supporters of the president's decision to run for reelection, and one of the chief deniers of his deterioration.\" Bernal's loyalty to the Bidens never faltered, and even after the disastrous debate performance in July 2024, Jill Biden and Bernal were determined to keep pushing on through November, Tapper and Thompson said.

A former White House staffer fired back against Tapper and Thompson's allegations about Bernal in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"A lot of vignettes in this book are either false, exaggerated, or purposefully omit viewpoints that don’t fit the narrative they want to push.

He recently settled a libel suit with ABC, forcing Bob Iger, who runs the network’s parent company Disney, to fork over $16 million. \n\nBut Disney and ABC aren’t in the middle of a merger, and the Paramount payment could be seen as a bribe to curry favor with the Trump administration and facilitate the Skydance deal, media executives tell On The Money.\n\nCompounding the problem for the board and Redstone is that D&O insurance typically doesn’t cover bribery. There is a possibility of civil suits brought by shareholders, a possible criminal investigation mounted by a Trump-hating prosecutor, and – if the Democrats take the House and/or the Senate in the midterms – endless congressional hearings.\n\n“I feel badly for her,” one top media CEO with direct knowledge of the matter said of Redstone. “She’s really in a tough spot.”“They’re really worried that they could face civil or even criminal charges and their insurance doesn’t cover the legal expense,” the executive added. “The problem is no one really thinks Trump has a good case and she would be settling to push the deal forward.”\n\nA Redstone spokeswoman declined comment. A Trump legal adviser declined to comment.\n\n“This lawsuit is completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process,” a Paramount spokesperson said in a statement. “We will abide by the legal process to defend our case.”Of course, businesses settle with the government all the time over regulatory infractions rather than engage in a more costly legal battle. Some media executives say the difference here is that Redstone isn’t settling with the government, but a single individual who has vast control over her wealth. Already several Democratic lawmakers such as Vermont socialist Senator Bernie Sanders have warned about the legal implications of a settlement.Despite the hand wringing, Redstone’s decision is said to be imminent and she has told people it is her preference to settle the matter and move on with her life. The Paramount-Skydance deal is valued at $8 billion. Redstone, 71, has seen her fortune evaporate with the sharp decline in Paramount stock in recent years.\n\nIf the deal is completed, she would walk away with $2 billion, and preserve a modicum of the wealth she inherited from her dad, the late media dealmaker Sumner Redstone.Trump filed the lawsuit against CBS last October during the heat of the 2024 presidential election, following a “60 Minutes” interview with Harris, the Democratic nominee. The lawsuit mirrors a complaint filed with the FCC by a conservative legal group that alleges that the CBS news magazine deceptively edited the interview to make Harris’s word-salad answers sound more presidential.CBS has long been accused of left-wing bias, though the First Amendment generally provides a free-speech shield. The Trump FCC, however, is contending that CBS, which operates over public airwaves as opposed to cable, has a legal, “public interest” duty to provide unbiased news coverage particularly during a presidential election.The FCC is holding up approving the Paramount-Skydance deal and Redstone’s much-needed access to cash as it investigates whether “60 Minutes” did indeed tilt the scales in its editing and the Trump lawsuit remains active in Texas federal court. \n\nThe conservative legal group known as the Center For American Rights says there is clear evidence of deceptive editing, pointing to the full transcript of the Harris interview that shows a long-winded, and in its view, less coherent answer to a policy question involving the war in Gaza.\n\n“60 Minutes” denies that it has done anything wrong and says that it regularly edits interviews for time considerations. Legal experts say Trump has weak grounds to sue given 60 Minutes past practices. But the Trump suit claims the editing violates Texas business law that makes it illegal to engage in “misleading, or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.”\n\nIn addition to her evaporating wealth, Redstone faces a steep tax bill — as much as $200 million — stemming from the ownership stake she inherited from her father after he died in 2020.","summary":"The Paramount payment could be seen as a bribe to curry favor with the Trump administration and facilitate the Skydance deal.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/28/media/shari-redstone-in-tough-spot-as-paramount-board-fears-settling-with-trump-will-open-pandoras-box-on-bribery-lawsuits-sources/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/reading-d-o-policies-checking-105414386-e1748400523414.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 10:00:00","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.253},{"id":325695712,"title":"Kamala Harris’s Time Abroad Got People Talking—And It’s Not What Trump Expected","text":"Kamala Harris’s last vacation, which she chose Hawaii for, sparked a major backlash, as it was right after she lost the election to Donald Trump.

Another added, “Alexa: play ‘Didn’t we almost have it all'” A third showed that they wished she’d won the election. “My President and First Gentleman,” they wrote.\n\nPeople positively took how good they looked with each other. Some commented on how they are actually together, with no separation or divorce rumor going on. We can’t say the same about Trump and Mrs. Trump, especially after Melania was caught snubbing the President’s PDA attempts.

A reader recently wrote to Vanessa Friedman, self-appointed fashion guru and notorious Trump hater, asking, \"Can I Wear a Sheath Dress Without Looking Like a MAGA Woman?\" HILLARY CLINTON BASHES REPUBLICAN WOMEN, SAYS GOP FEMALE PRESIDENT WOULD BE 'HANDMAIDEN TO THE PATRIARCHY' Friedman replied with a catty description of MAGA style as a \"cross between a Fox newscaster and Miss Universe\" that \"underscores an almost cartoonish femininity that speaks to a relatively old-fashioned gender stereotype.\" And yes, a sheath dress is part of the \"look.\" If you insist on wearing a simple, convenient (and attractive) sheath dress, says the fashion critic, you can avoid looking MAGA by keeping \"your hair natural or messy.\" She continues, \"Keep your makeup minimal and your heels low. Maybe wear boots or even flats or sneakers instead of pumps…\" In other words, don’t go for attractive, or feminine, because you might end up wearing your \"politics on [your] sleeve,\" and looking like an \"A.I.-generated member of a crowd.\" Friedman is no newcomer to Trump Derangement Syndrome or hating on conservative women. In 2016, she wrote a plaintive article bemoaning Hillary Clinton’s loss to the newly-elected Donald Trump, saying fashion designers had so been looking forward to dressing the former Secretary of State (and presumably dismayed they were left with gorgeous ex-fashion model Melania.) She gushed over Clinton’s ubiquitous shapeless pants suits, while fretting that Melania’s clothes appeared \"bought off the rack\"; the horror! In the Times’ theater of the absurd, Friedman plays court jester. Of course, the style critic plays to a crowd that cannot define what a woman is; how in the world would they know how to dress one? Friedman is not the only Mean Girl. Not long ago, Hillary Clinton was asked at a \"conversation,\" at New York’s 92nd Street Y, what advice she might give to the first woman to become president of the U.S. HILLARY CLINTON IS BACK AND DOING WHAT SHE DOES BEST -- TRASHING WOMEN Clinton paused, and then answered, \"Well, first of all, don’t be a handmaiden to the patriarchy, which kind of eliminates every woman on the other side of the aisle, except for very few.\" Get it? Democrat women are powerful warriors, fending for themselves and not bowing to the \"patriarchy,\" while Republican women are mere handmaidens, meekly bearing children and serving their dictatorial toxically masculine husbands. Considering that Hillary Clinton climbed to national prominence on the back of her husband Bill Clinton’s political career, cynically stood by him despite numerous affairs and credible accusations of rape, it was a remarkably un-self-aware remark. It reminds us of Mark Cuban’s equally insulting slap at GOP women, when he told the loony hosts of \"The View\" last year that former President Donald Trump is \"never\" around any \"strong and intelligent women.\" He went on to say, \"They’re intimidating to [Trump]. He doesn’t like to be challenged by them. Nikki Haley will call him on his nonsense with reproductive rights and how he sees and treats and talks about women. I mean, he just can’t have her around.\" It was an extraordinarily idiotic comment from Cuban. He must have forgotten that Trump picked Haley to be his ambassador to the UN and that he was also the first-ever candidate to have a woman – Kellyanne Conway -- run his campaign. And, one of the first to employ a female press secretary. I’d love to have Cuban sit down with Susie Wiles, Pam Bondi, Kristi Noem and Alina Habba and repeat those remarks; he might want to bring protection.

If they do, the Democratic Party is toast. In a recent podcast, former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer warned that Democrats’ loss of Hispanic voters over recent election cycles could doom the party. In 2016, he noted, Hillary Clinton won over 70% of the Hispanic vote; last year, Kamala Harris bested Trump with a much narrower margin, receiving 56% of that group’s vote. Harris eked out the win, but the slide in Latino support is worrisome for a political party dependent on women and minorities. In 2024, Democrats’ slippage with Black and Hispanic voters was nearly plugged by the so-called gender gap, with roughly 55% of women turning out for Harris and 45% voting for Trump. Men were on the flip side. Since 1996, women have preferred Democrat candidates; the gender gap has ranged from 7 to 12 points; in the last election it ticked down. Interestingly, the gap prevailed long before abortion was on the ballot. Imagine the alarm bells that would sound if women began turning away from the increasingly left-wing Democrats. As more women enter the workforce, they may rebel over Democrats’ insistence on ever-higher taxes and begin to focus more on economic issues. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Last year, a month before the election, a KFF survey found inflation the most pressing concern for women; abortion tied with immigration as number three. Another problem for Democrats: young mothers are increasingly paying attention to Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s MAHA initiatives. They don’t want their babies eating carcinogenic food dyes or filling up with microplastics. Kennedy’s assault on Big Food may turn out to be the Trump administration’s most successful outreach to women yet.

Subscribe here.\n\nBy David Enrich\n\nCBS’s 60 Minutes has been the top-rated news show in America since 1974, longer than most Americans have been alive. One in three Americans watched it last year, and it reached 100 million viewers total. It is at the heart of American news, a well-funded and well-regarded powerhouse relied on by working-class, poor, rich, white, Black, Latino, and Asian Americans.\n\nHoping to get a merger waved through by Donald Trump’s Federal Communications Commission, Paramount, the parent company of CBS, has apparently pressured the flagship newsmagazine to muffle its reporting to avoid Trump’s displeasure. Credible reporting indicates the chair of Paramount Global, Shari Redstone, told 60 Minutes producers to suppress stories that were critical of Trump. The executive producer of 60 Minutes resigned, saying he was no longer able to do his job, and correspondent Scott Pelley gave an unprecedented on-air statement, noting that the Trump administration had the power to approve a proposed merger between Paramount and Skydance, and then asserting that “Paramount began to supervise our content in new ways.”\n\nThe appalling story of 60 Minutes is not an isolated editorial judgment. It’s a symptom of a deeper, structural crisis in American journalism. Trump started his anti-press campaign by talking about “fake news” in 2016. But in his second term, he has turned from rhetoric to coercive power, wielding threats and lawsuits to attempt to control what is written and broadcast.\n\nWhile everyone argues about the big-C Constitutional Crisis caused by a break between Trump and the Supreme Court, the small-c constitutional crisis of the press is here. The biggest news organizations are making deals, feeding the incentive for Trump to make more threats and more demands.\n\nHe sued ABC News over George Stephanopoulos saying “judges and two separate juries have found him liable for rape,” and ABC folded—despite having the stronger legal case—giving him a multimillion-dollar settlement. Paramount is in mediation to settle a similar Trump lawsuit over how 60 Minutes presented an interview answer by Kamala Harris during the 2024 campaign.\n\nThe companies he hasn’t sued, he’s tried to intimidate. Trump revoked the press pool access of the Associated Press as punishment for using the wrong words in February, and continued doing so even after the AP got a court order to prevent the exclusion. Trump signed an executive order directing the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, a private nonprofit that receives federal money and provides support to public media outlets PBS and NPR, to cease its funding of those organizations. Regardless of how this order survives in court, each attack feeds the devouring anti-press machine and can have an effect on the actual news people see and read.\n\nIn other words, “fake news” has become a serious and targeted effort to undermine independent journalism and delegitimize investigations, as its ringleader cheers on the destruction of press freedoms.\n\nIf a corrupt deal happens in the forest of Mar-a-Lago, and no one reports on it, did it really happen?\n\nTo understand the forces at work, David Enrich’s new book, Murder the Truth, is an indispensable guide. The word “chill” has become a mechanical cliché in conversations about press freedom. But reading about the growing revolution in libel and defamation lawsuits against journalists and media companies, that word suddenly recovered its original meaning. With each lawsuit Enrich recounts, it’s as if another cold finger touches the spine. On their own, they are disturbing; collectively, they seize the body politic with dread.\n\nI’m a big fan of Enrich, a business investigations editor at The New York Times. He has a rare ability to spot the dramatic stories that underlie and drive significant legal change. His last book, Servants of the Damned, was the best thing I’ve read about the post-1970s transformation of the legal profession. In telling the story of Jones Day, the law firm that had recently become infamous for its MAGA affiliations, Enrich managed to tell a larger story about how law firms were structurally transformed into entities optimized to serve concentrated power, and how such a transformation was not just “same as it ever was,” but a significant shift from an earlier ethos of law. That book is also the best guide I know to understanding what came as a shock to many recently: the wholesale capitulation of firms like Paul, Weiss and others under the mildest pressure from Donald Trump 2.0.\n\nIn Murder the Truth, Enrich again tells a story of legal structure and cultural change. This time, his subject is the press—and the legal war against it. It is, at its core, a warning about the potential unraveling of New York Times v. Sullivan, the landmark 1964 case that created the modern doctrine of press protections in the U.S. In the Sullivan framework, there are two kinds of libel law: that regarding public figures and that regarding nonpublic figures. When a statement concerns a public figure, a libel case can only be sustained if the press made a false statement with knowledge or reckless disregard of its falsity. After Sullivan, public figures had a more difficult time proving libel claims.\n\nEnrich’s book genuinely changed my mind. Before I read it, you could have counted me in the Sullivan-skeptic camp. I didn’t have a full framework, but was open to the notion that the case was outdated, ill-suited to an era of widespread casual lies and clickbait, and likely a shield for carelessness. I tend to think we undervalue the power of common-law torts, and I’ve chronicled how press freedom claims have been exploited by corporations, and helped lead to Citizens United. However, I was persuaded otherwise by the deep reporting and storytelling of what investigations and resources actually look like in the vast majority of newsrooms around the country. As Enrich says in his acknowledgments, he was inspired to write the book by the number of aggressive legal libel letters that come pounding at the door of his employer, The New York Times, and his resulting curiosity about how smaller newsrooms dealt with them.\n\nIn gorgeous journalistic detail, he reveals a legal framework that actually mostly works in practice. Courts uphold defamation suits when journalists act with unforgivable sloppiness or malice, and they dismiss suits when reporting is backed by evidence, followed by quick retractions, or conducted in good faith.\n\nBut while the doctrine holds, the surrounding infrastructure is collapsing. Enrich moves through the homes and offices of journalists and the extreme financial stress of legal threats. Too many reporters drop out after legal challenges, and newspapers shrink. They quit not because they lost in court, but because the lawsuits themselves, which are expensive and purposefully terrifying, do the work of silencing them. Murder the Truth is littered with the bodies of small papers and independent reporters who couldn’t afford to keep going.\n\nThe real breakdown is not doctrinal, but economic. The story Enrich tells is how wealthy plaintiffs are becoming far more systematic in bringing ruinous lawsuits not to win them, but to inflict costs. For some powerful interests, the goal is not just to kill stories or outlets, but the law that makes the stories possible. A central story is the initially covert role played by Peter Thiel, who funded the lawsuit that led to the end of Gawker.\n\nIn the background of Murder the Truth is a catastrophe: the collapse of local journalism. The past two decades have seen the hollowing out of local papers across the country, driven by hedge fund buyouts and monopolistic platforms stealing ad revenues. We are currently losing local newspapers at the rate of over two a week, according to Northwestern University, and have lost more than a third of local news organizations in the last 20 years. The number of communities with no local news reporting at all has been rapidly growing, and while a few elite publications continue to do great investigations, the heart of investigative journalism in America has long been the non-flashy local story. When those local news organizations are being bullied into silence, we lose out on democracy itself, and the capacity to know even our own communities.\n\nI came to understand through these stories that the real problem of defamatory content online is not a Sullivan problem. It’s a Section 230 problem, a reference to the provision in the Communications Decency Act of 1996 that shields platforms from liability for user content. Enrich’s target is not platform behavior or immunity; his in-depth reporting is far from the bowels of Zuckerberg’s empire. But this book forced me to confront how I had sloppily conflated Sullivan and Section 230. Undermining Sullivan won’t solve the business model of Big Tech, whose offerings reward inflammatory content with impunity. It would just put the final knife in the daily heroic journalism done all around the country.\n\nEnrich excels at capturing the cast of characters in each of his stories, and he draws a clear through line from the rise of strategic lawsuits, to the well-funded ideological efforts to gut Sullivan, to a coordinated legal strategy to make the press less free, less courageous, and more beholden to power. I don’t want to give away the juiciest details, but there are many, often of just the variety that would land a smaller paper—one without massive insurance and a full-time team of the country’s best lawyers—in litigation. The carefully reported affairs and vandalism for hire seem designed as litigation bait, or a thumb in the nose of public figures who would rather organize their own public image.\n\nEnrich does not cast himself as a Cassandra, but I read him as one. Servants of the Damned forecast the decimation of the legal profession’s moral center. Murder the Truth warns of a different kind of unraveling in the law that protects journalism.\n\nWhat is an aspiring democracy without a free press? If a corrupt deal happens in the forest known as Mar-a-Lago, or the smaller thickets in state capitols and city council meeting rooms, and no one reports on it, did it really happen?\n\nElsewhere, the assault on the press is literal, physical, and gruesome, highlighting just how fragile our own press protections are. Since October 2023, Israel has killed over 160 journalists in Gaza, with many reportedly targeted despite wearing press vests or being in marked media facilities. Israel has restricted access for foreign journalists and destroyed dozens of media offices in Gaza. In Indonesia last year, journalists were repeatedly physically attacked in reprisal for their reporting, and the government used spyware to discourage reporting and dissent. In Hungary, the Orbán government has destroyed the press by eating it, while heaping funding on his own propaganda outfits. In Azerbaijan, the government is putting journalists on trial for smuggling. A 2025 report by the Civil Liberties Union for Europe warned that media freedom and pluralism across the European Union is being severely threatened by increased media ownership concentration, government influence on public media, and intimidation of journalists.\n\nAnd in the U.S.? Well, it might look slightly better, but in the country that truly pioneered the free press as the Fourth Estate, the independent press is looking less like an estate and more like a small ragtag crew of intrepid reporters, and a few large institutional leaders, some of whom are willing to reshape their views to please the King. This is not just a shift in tone—it is a shift in structure, in power, and in law. From 60 Minutes to local papers, the recent and sudden loss of press independence signals deep democratic dysfunction.","summary":"In a time of eroding journalistic freedoms, a new book chronicles the deliberate effort to use libel law to bankrupt the independent media we have left.","url":"https://prospect.org/culture/books/2025-05-28-beating-the-press-enrich-review/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/22935/download/JUN25%20Teachout.jpg?cb=b7aaba216eb051f326a7559314b7f031&w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 09:00:00","author":"Zephyr Teachout","authors":["Zephyr Teachout"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":325925246,"title":"Real estate future: Kamala Harris & AI innovation","text":"In a landmark session at this year's Australian Real Estate Conference (AREC), held on Sunday 24 June on the Gold Coast, former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris took the stage for a compelling fireside chat that resonated deeply with the 4000 property professionals in attendance.\n\n In an on-stage interview with AREC founder John McGrath, Harris spoke candidly about the housing challenges facing both Australia and the U.S.\n\n \"Here and in the United States, we share this issue, which is a phenomenal issue especially for young families - affordable housing,\" she said. \n\n \"Part of my platform was and includes that the government really needs to work much more closely with the private sector to be clear about what the incentives are, as well as the disincentives, to build more housing.\"\n\n She also acknowledged the barriers facing younger generations. \n\n \"When you look at Gen Z, among the many challenges they face, greater than any previous generation, the dream of home ownership is one of the greatest.\"\n\n Throughout the session, Harris drew striking parallels between her own trailblazing career and the evolving role of real estate agents. \n\n \"You allow people to actually implement their dream of creating a place that is not only a symbol of their hard work, but an extension of their dignity,\" Ms Harris said.\n\n \"You allow people to have a home, and for the vast majority of these folks, it is the most intricate and most significant financial arrangement they'll ever be in.\n\n \"It represents intergenerational wealth for them. It is their peace. It is the place they will create family memories. It is the place in which they can feel a sense of pride in their identity.\" she said. \n\n Reflecting on her upbringing as the daughter of immigrant civil rights activists, Harris underscored a simple but powerful lesson: true innovation must improve the human condition, not just pursue novelty.\n\n She recounted high-stakes negotiations from her time as a prosecutor and later as a senator, moments where integrity, preparation, and empathy shaped outcomes. \n\n \"Your eyes will never be as fresh as they are when first presented with a file,\" she noted, advocating for honest self-assessment and respectful human connection in any deal. \n\n Following AREC, the momentum continued the following day at The Leader Conference where Drew McTavish, Head of Product at Propic (part of the View Media Group) shared a bold vision for AI's role in real estate. \n\n Introducing the concept of the \"AI Agent,\" McTavish described a future where autonomous software doesn't just support agents, but actively works on their behalf. \n\n \"An AI Agent is an autonomous software entity that uses data inputs to reason, make context-aware decisions, and perform tasks,\" he said. \n\n He emphasised the transition from simple AI advice tools to actionable intelligence that transforms how agents serve clients. \n\n \"This is the jump from advice to action,\" McTavish declared, positioning Propic's Generative AI (part of the view.resi solution) as a leap toward smarter, faster, and more human-centric customer experiences. \n\n Wrapping up with a message of empowerment, McTavish encouraged agents to embrace the shift. \n\n \"Get in the game! You don't have to do everything. Keep your focus on high-value tasks, talk to people, and let AI do the rest.\" \n\n Together, Harris's call for integrity and community impact, and McTavish's vision of AI-driven agency, sketched a future where real estate is on the bleeding edge. \n\nSEE ALL: Check out view.resi's AI capabilities with Propic","summary":"The former US Vice President called for empathy as AI promises to push boundaries of human connection in real estate","url":"https://view.com.au/news/real-estate-future-kamala-harris-ai-innovation/","image":"https://view.com.au/viewstatic/images/illuminate/350-w/8978440-b-0-d9d1c9ecceb9e2.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 05:41:41","author":"Emily Rayner","authors":["Emily Rayner"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.579},{"id":325584318,"title":"Michael Goodwin: Scott Pelley’s anti-Trump diatribe was more of the same warped, distorted nonsense that puts the BS in CBS","text":"Leaving aside that Scott Pelley probably spoiled graduation day for some Wake Forest University parents and students, his anti-Trump commencement screed last week still has its virtues.\n\nNamely, Pelley’s outrageous fearmongering throws open the window to the mindset of a media figure at one of the nation’s supposedly premier outlets. \n\nThe view we get is so appalling as to be stomach-churning.\n\nIt turns out that the man from CBS is full of BS.\n\nBut we already knew that, didn’t we? \n\nThe surprise is that he outed himself in such a revealing and public spectacle.\n\nWarped by partisanship\n\nPelley’s description of America and Trump’s agenda is so warped by partisanship that he can’t see straight. \n\nHis version of reality brings to mind the distortions of a fun-house mirror — without the fun.\n\nCarried away by his own grandiosity, he fancies himself a brave truth-teller and reaches for historic comparisons.\n\nOnly the most celebrated will do, as Pelley links his juvenile scare tactics to the bold wartime broadcasts of Edward R. Murrow while Hitler was bombing London and the prescient warnings of George Orwell about fascism.\n\nAfter quoting Orwell as saying, “If liberty means anything at all, it means something worth saying that some people don’t want to hear,” Pelley not so humbly adds: “I fear there are some people in the audience who don’t want to hear what I have to say today. But I appreciate your forbearance in this small act of liberty.”\n\nWhat courage! \n\nWhat humor!\n\nHe never mentions the president’s name, but doesn’t have to. \n\nHis language steals from the headlines of Trump-bashing -media everywhere.\n\nIt’s a testament to their conformity that we know who and what he’s talking about because the legacy outlets all think and speak in lockstep.\n\nDay in, day out, the heights of journalism plumb the depths of conformity.\n\nEverything Pelley said, we’ve heard 10,000 times before. \n\nAnd often with more insight and balance.\n\nBut he didn’t go to Wake Forest to be fair. \n\nHe went to recruit those who don’t hate and fear their president by trying to scare them half to death.\n\n“Our sacred rule of law is under attack. Journalism is under attack. Universities are under attack. Freedom of speech is under attack,” Pelley insisted. \n\n“An insidious fear is reaching through our schools, our businesses, our homes and into our private thoughts. The fear to speak. In America?”\n\n‘Speaking’ of irony\n\nIs this a commencement address in 2025 or the introduction to a 1950s late-night horror movie?\n\nThe theme song of “Jaws” would have made a fitting backdrop, with Trump as the frightening Great White.\n\nBecause no self-respecting graduation speech is complete without citing Abraham Lincoln, Pelley goes for the obvious, saying that “If our government is — in Lincoln’s words — ‘of the people, by the people and for the people’ — then why are we afraid to speak?”\n\nYet there he is, speaking!\n\nActual fairness doesn’t interest him or his network. The once-trusted CBS has become just -another dog barking at shadows.\n\nWorse, Pelley is a member of the “60 Minutes” team that is leading the charge downhill.\n\nIt denied the legitimacy of Hunter Biden’s infamous laptop long after The Post proved it was real, and even after the FBI -authenticated its damning contents.\n\nAnd neither Pelley nor any of his colleagues saw the slightest hint that Joe Biden was suffering from serious cognitive decline. To admit it would have helped Trump, so they looked the other way.\n\nYou know, to save democracy.\n\nThe program continued to shill for Biden up until the minute he dropped out of the presidential campaign, then immediately shifted gears to shill for Kamala Harris.\n\nThe selective editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with her is the target of a Trump lawsuit and is spurring fears among top management that a corporate merger with Skydance Media will be blocked by federal agencies.\n\nOddly, that fear is having something of an admirable impact in that some segments on “60 Minutes” and presumably elsewhere on the network are being more closely scrutinized for fairness before airing.\n\nAs for Pelley, he made it clear he doesn’t like the oversight by recently lionizing the program’s former executive producer, Bill Owens, who resigned by sayinghe had lost control over the contents.\n\nCareer death knell?\n\nPerhaps Pelley also fears for his own paycheck, which could explain why he’s forsaking journalism and diving into the darkness of propaganda. \n\nHe’d fit right in at MSNBC.\n\nWhatever the cause, his speech should mark the death knell of his CBS career.\n\nHow can it be otherwise when the underlying assumption is that if you aren’t consumed with hate and fear over the president, there’s something wrong with you?\n\nIt breaks my heart to say it, but this is the ethos of most contemporary journalism, where independent thinking is verboten. \n\nOnly one thought per customer is permitted, and it must conform to the party line.\n\n“Tuition liberation day” is what many parents call graduation, but Pelley didn’t even have the grace to make anything other than a passing reference to those who paid the outrageous bills Wake Forest charges.\n\nAll they got was a lecture about what a horrible country they and their children live in because there is a monster in the White House.\n\nThings are so bad that Pelley felt compelled to compare the current mood to the run-up of the Civil War, the early days of World War II and the campus rebellions over Vietnam.\n\nThe fact that Trump was elected — and carried — North Carolina, where Wake Forest is located, never figures into the screed.\n\nThat’s not an accident. To acknowledge that a contrasting point of view exists would cast doubt on Pelley’s dogma.\n\nHe calls himself a “reporter,” as if he’s Detective Joe Friday, another television creation who just sticks to the facts.\n\nIn Pelley’s case, that’s not only false modesty — it’s also inaccurate.\n\nJust the facts? Hardly\n\nFormer CBS giant Dan Rather used to say the same thing about himself — right up to the moment he got booted for using phony documents to try to help Al Gore defeat George W. Bush.\n\nSimilarly, Pelley has come out as a rank partisan and can never again be trusted to cover anything remotely related to Trump or -politics.\n\nConsider that a majority of North Carolina voters backed Trump, meaning that some of the adults in Pelley’s audience, including faculty and parents, and possibly many students, voted for the man their graduation speaker described as a wannabe fascist dictator.\n\nAnd a racist. \n\nBecause in addition to his silly comparisons to World War II, Pelley likened the current atmosphere to the run-up of the Civil War.\n\nGet a grip, man!\n\nThen there’s Wake Forest itself. \n\nIt’s an elite private school where full-time tuition and other costs surpass $90,000 a year.\n\nIt’s not exactly a middle-class bastion or in any way representative of the concerns of most American families.\n\nThen again, neither are Scott Pelley and CBS.","summary":"Leaving aside that Scott Pelley probably spoiled graduation day for some Wake Forest University parents and students, his anti-Trump commencement screed last week still has its virtues.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/27/opinion/michael-goodwin-pelleys-anti-trump-commencement-speech-was-a-public-spectacle-filled-with-nonsense/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/newspress-collage-bysl67d1m-1748396136931.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1748381883&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 02:22:35","author":"Michael Goodwin","authors":["Michael Goodwin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.241},{"id":325576842,"title":"Obamas spotted together on NYC date night after Michelle admits she's in therapy amid divorce rumors","text":"Former President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama were seen together in public on Tuesday evening for the first time in six months, stepping out for a date night on Manhattan's Upper East Side amid months of speculation about the state of their marriage.\n\nThe couple was spotted leaving The Lowell Hotel restaurant accompanied by a full entourage of Secret Service agents who cleared the sidewalk as the Obamas left the the boutique property. \n\nTheir appearance marked the first time they've been photographed together since December 2024.\n\nMichelle, 61, led the way as the couple walked towards their waiting black SUV.\n\nDressed in black dress and black heels she appeared to flash a broad smile to onlookers and cameras. Her hair was tied back in a bun and she carried a small black clutch.\n\nTrailing just behind, Barack, 63, looked more pensive with his expression harder to read - tight-lipped, serious, and unusually reserved.\n\nDespite the mild temperatures he wore a black wool overcoat and dark grey pants as he made his way to the vehicle.\n\nThe contrast between them couldn’t have been more striking with Michelle, leading the way with poise and ease with her husband quiet and unsmiling. \n\nThe outing comes after months of swirling speculation that the Obamas' marriage has hit the rocks with rumors only fueled further by Michelle's noticeable absence from several high-profile events this year, including January's presidential inauguration and the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nIn March, Michelle also skipped their usual courtside seats at the NBA All-Star Game.\n\n The coupe were seen going out to dinner in DC last month.\n\nSocial media and the tabloids have all served to amplify claims that the couple may soon be heading for a split. On one recent podcast Michelle revealed how she is in therapy to help her transition to what she thinks is the 'next phase' of her life.\n\nEarlier this month, Michelle addressed the rumors head on during an episode of the podcast The Diary of a CEO.\n\n'If I were having problems with my husband, everybody would know about it,' Michelle said. \n\nShe dismissed speculation about marital issues emphasizing that her decisions to skip certain high-profile events were personal choices aimed at prioritizing her own needs, rather than any indications of marital discord. \n\nDuring the podcast Michelle acknowledged that marriage is 'hard' for her and the former president but added that 'I wouldn't trade it,' calling President Obama, 'as the young people say... my person.' \n\n'The beauty of my husband and our partnership is that neither one of us was ever really, ever going to quit at it, because that's not who we are.

The couple was seen enjoying a date night on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, following months of rumor and chatter about their relationship.\n\nThe Obamas were noticed departing from The Lowell Hotel, accompanied by a full team of Secret Service agents who ensured the sidewalk was cleared for their exit from the boutique hotel.\n\nTheir appearance marked the first time they’ve been photographed together since December 2024.\n\nMichelle, 61, led the way as the couple walked towards their waiting black SUV.\n\nMichelle Obama, stylishly dressed in a black dress and matching heels, appeared cheerful, flashing a wide smile to those around and the photographers. Her hair was elegantly tied in a bun, and she carried a small, black clutch.\n\nTrailing just behind, Barack, 63, looked more pensive. Despite the mild temperatures he wore a black wool overcoat and dark grey pants as he made his way to the vehicle.\n\nThe outing comes after months of swirling speculation that the Obamas’ marriage has hit the rocks with rumors only fueled further by Michelle’s noticeable absence from several high-profile events in recent months, including January’s presidential inauguration and the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter.\n\nSocial media and the tabloids have all served to amplify claims that the couple may soon be heading for a split. On one recent podcast Michelle revealed how she is in therapy to help her transition to what she thinks is the ‘next phase’ of her life.\n\nEarlier this month, Michelle addressed the rumors head on during an episode of the podcast The Diary of a CEO.\n\n‘If I were having problems with my husband, everybody would know about it,’ Michelle said. \n\nShe dismissed speculation about marital issues emphasizing that her decisions to skip certain high-profile events were personal choices aimed at prioritizing her own needs, rather than any indications of marital discord. \n\nDuring the podcast Michelle acknowledged that marriage is ‘hard’ for her and the former president but added that ‘I wouldn’t trade it,’ calling President Obama, ‘as the young people say… my person.’ \n\n‘The beauty of my husband and our partnership is that neither one of us was ever really, ever going to quit at it, because that’s not who we are.

It was brutal.”\n\nDon Jr. said he and Eric “definitely” had a hand in helping their father, who called bitcoin a scam in 2021, understand the potential of crypto and blockchain technology.\n\n“We were the ones who were getting subpoenaed in nonsense lawsuits, we were the ones who are dealing with getting de-banked … we’re the guys who probably saw that first-hand,” he said of him and his brother. “We probably, maybe got there a little bit before him. Once we started explaining the potential, he’s a quick study … he got there pretty quickly.”\n\nOnce Trump embraced crypto on the campaign trail, Don Jr. said he got a laugh out of other candidates, including Democratic nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris, jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon.\n\n“I would pay money, a lot of money, maybe my entire crypto wallet, to have Kamala Harris explain blockchain technology,” Don Jr. said. “That would be the greatest word salad in the history of Kamala Harris word salad.”\n\nDon Jr. added that his father “cares about doing what’s right for America,” saying the democratization of finance “is a fundamental tenant after, like, world peace, of what he wants to accomplish in this administration.”\n\nThe Trump family’s crypto ventures, including the TRUMP memecoin and World Liberty Financial, have been heavily criticized in both the industry and the government for being opaque and allegedly presenting conflicts of interest. However, since Trump took office, there has been a renewed push for new regulations and the passage of crypto legislation, as well as the apparent end to the so-called regulation-by-enforcement practiced by regulators during former President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nWith stablecoin legislation seemingly around the corner, potentially followed by a comprehensive market structure bill and strategic bitcoin reserve legislation, Don Jr. said the improved regulatory clarity for the industry will be a boon for bitcoin.\n\n“I think you have the perfect storm for this thing just going to the moon, as they say,” he said.","summary":"The eldest son of U.S. President Donald Trump said his family’s interest in crypto was, at least at first, “a product of necessity.”","url":"https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/05/27/donald-trump-jr-says-getting-debanked-de-insured-de-everything-orange-pilled-him","image":"https://cdn.sanity.io/images/s3y3vcno/production/e0cb3d68d9cdd4b84e04c2bf09779a970e015025-7637x5228.jpg?auto=format","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 01:08:06","author":"Cheyenne Ligon","authors":["Cheyenne Ligon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.154},{"id":325576858,"title":"Kamala Harris gets VERY embarrassing endorsement to run for governor of California","text":"As speculation swirls around whether Kamala Harris will make a bid for governor of California, she has received support from the most unlikely source - California Republicans.\n\n'I sense that this is the best shot for someone to be elected statewide in California who's not a Democrat for at least 20 years, and I think the evident reason for that is the failure of one-party rule,' conservative commentator Steve Hilton declared in a recent fundraising email. \n\n'The candidate who's going to win in 2026, regardless of party label, is the change candidate. Kamala Harris is the one who least represents change.' \n\nWith Governor Gavin Newsom term-limited out in 2026, Harris has remained coy about her future, teasing in an April appearance, 'I'll see you out there. I'm not going anywhere.' \n\nAcross GOP circles, the prospect of Harris entering the race is being openly celebrated for what it promises Republican candidates. \n\nFrom political consultants to fringe MAGA influencers, a Harris candidacy is being treated as a golden opportunity to rile up donors, energize disaffected voters, and, perhaps most crucially, draw national attention to an otherwise unwinnable contest.\n\n'I'd jump for joy,' Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco told supporters. 'She's the perfect example of everything Californians are sick of - soft on crime, blind to our problems, and more focused on DC than Main Street.'\n\nRepublican strategist Dave Gilliard agreed, saying her entry would be a dream scenario. \n\n'I think it could attract some donors from around the country who might be interested in taking another pound of flesh,' Republican political consultant Dave Gilliard said to Politico. \n\n'Money is the biggest obstacle other than the registration because the donor world doesn't think a Republican can be elected governor anymore.' \n\nEven Elon Musk's name has been floated as a possible wildcard donor. \n\nThe former vice president has given herself until late summer to decide whether to run. \n\nThe billionaire has sparred with Harris on social media and publicly blasted her support for diversity policies and social justice causes. \n\nWhile Musk hasn't weighed in directly, insiders suggest his disdain for Harris could reignite his interest in California politics.\n\nThere's a reason Harris evokes such a visceral response from the right. Her tenure as vice president was marked by relentless attacks from Donald Trump and conservative media. \n\nHer prosecutorial past has been dissected from both the left and the right and her 2024 loss to Trump, after stepping in as the Democratic nominee following Biden's withdrawal, mean she is toxic when it comes to elections.\n\n'She's had her chance,' said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. 'Democrats must turn elsewhere for leadership.'\n\nBut Republican messaging is far from subtle. 'This is our shot,' Hilton told supporters. 'She'll clear the Democratic field, but we'll get to define her - and she's already underwater.'\n\nIndeed, while Harris trounced Trump in California in 2024, she underperformed Joe Biden's 2020 numbers, particularly among Latinos and swing voters in purple counties.\n\n'She won two statewide elections, and she won in California when she was running for president,' Bianco said. 'But those votes didn't go to Kamala Harris. Those votes went against Donald Trump.' \n\nCalifornia's infamous 'jungle primary' system means that Harris wouldn't necessarily face a Republican in the general election. \n\nAll candidates compete in a single open primary, and the top two vote-getters - regardless of party - advance.\n\nThat means Harris could be forced into a brutal head-to-head with another Democrat in the general. Already, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Rep. Katie Porter, and Xavier Becerra are eyeing the race. \n\nAt least some, however, are expected to bow out if Harris runs.\n\n'She's got the résumé - but so do a lot of people who've lost,' said Republican consultant Kevin Madden. 'What she doesn't have is momentum.'\n\nAnd Democratic strategist Eric Jaye cautioned against viewing the race as a coronation. 'She's polarizing, and not just with Republicans. Democrats have questions too.'\n\nIf Harris were to run, she'd inherit a California in turmoil.\n\nThe state is facing a $12 billion deficit, wildfires are worsening, homelessness remains a humanitarian crisis, and home insurance markets are collapsing.\n\n'Why the hell would you want this job?' Newsom himself quipped on the Next Up with Mark Halperin podcast. \n\n'You need a burning 'why.' If you can't enunciate that, don't do it.'\n\nWhile Harris has nearly universal name recognition, an elite fundraising machine, and deep institutional ties, she also carries a historic loss to Donald Trump, middling approval ratings, and a political brand that has never quite caught fire.\n\n'If she's beatable (and if she runs), it won't be by a Republican. But Republicans can still turn her candidacy into a weapon,' Democratic consultant Dan Newman explained. 'For now at least, Republicans can't win statewide.'\n\nEven if Harris wins, Republicans are ready to claim a different kind of victory.\n\n'She has a chance to be embarrassed even if she wins,' said GOP consultant Kevin Spillane, who managed the campaign of Harris' 2010 opponent. 'It could be a pyrrhic victory.","summary":"Kamala Harris is weighing a run for California governor with an unexpected group already rallying for her to enter the race.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14755375/kamala-harris-endorsement-republicans-california-governor-race.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/05/28/01/98806445-0-image-a-28_1748390974401.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 00:59:12","author":"Editor,James Gordon","authors":["Editor","James Gordon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":325573556,"title":"Will Shari Redstone Face Bribery Charges if She Settles  Trump’s $20 Billion ‘60 Minutes’ Lawsuit?","text":"Could Paramount Global and Shari Redstone find themselves facing bribery charges if they settle a $20 billion lawsuit with President Donald Trump, as three U.S. senators have suggested?\n\nAs pressure mounts on the Paramount chairwoman, legal experts dismissed the notion of bribery charges as a “non-case” — but that doesn’t mean Paramount would not face other legal actions if the company settles, they said.\n\n“There is no real possibility that she’s charged with bribery first, just on the substance litigation,” former federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told TheWrap. “There’s always uncertainty, so settling a lawsuit, I don’t think any judge anywhere would consider that a bribe.”\n\nEntertainment and media lawyer Tre Lovell agreed. “There’s no bribery here because there’s actual litigation. There’s threats of damages of $20 billion and as a litigant you’re entitled to settle it,” he told TheWrap.\n\nIn order for the settlement to be seen as bribery, the alleged action must meet the bribery statutes, which would be giving a public official something of value with a corrupt intent to influence an official act. The experts were not convinced an action of settling a lawsuit by Paramount fits the bribery bill. \n\n“It’s a little bit far-fetched,” said Dan O’Neil, a veteran telecom attorney. “Clearly there’s a lot written between the lines. But Trump has not said, ‘We won’t approve the sale if you don’t pay us.’ And the FCC says its approval of the sale has nothing to do with the lawsuit.” \n\n“This is just political posturing,” said Rahmani, also the president of West Coast Trial Lawyers. “There’s no way the Department of Justice, any U.S. attorney in this country, is going to investigate or prosecute this case, both in terms of the weakness of the case [and] the political climate.”\n\nStill, in a letter last week, three Democratic senators – Bernie Sanders (VT), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore) – warned Redstone that catering to Trump’s whims may be bribery. \n\nAnd on Friday, media advocacy group Freedom of the Press Foundation sent the Paramount mogul a warning letter, outlining plans to file a lawsuit if the media company settles the Trump suit against CBS. That suit would be a shareholders derivatives lawsuit, which legal experts say are common.\n\nThe nonprofit itself is able to seek damages in this case because it owns shares of Paramount. It plans to act on behalf of itself and other shareholders, alleging that the settlement would waste corporate assets by “engaging in conduct that U.S. senators and others believe could amount to unlawful bribery.”\n\nLast October, the then-Republican presidential candidate sued CBS News and Paramount for $10 billion over allegations of election interference by editing a “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris that aired weeks before the election. That amount has since jumped to $20 billion. \n\nTrump accused the news program of deceptively editing that interview. Legal experts have since called the lawsuit frivolous. \n\nSince taking office, Trump’s FCC has also opened an investigation into news practices at CBS News. The FCC led by Commissioner Brendan Carr has to approve the media company’s Skydance merger, valued at $8 billion.\n\nStill, Paramount is facing even more blowback that may land it in court.\n\nPress group poised to sue\n\nRahmani said the derivatives lawsuit is typically filed when shareholders believe a company has done something illegal.\n\n“The legal standard is: Did the directors, did the officers of the corporation, did they do something that hurt the corporation such that it affected the shareholder stock price?” he said. The Freedom of the Press Foundation and the senators are arguing that the settlement could have greater implications on the Paramount brand.\n\nBut the “business judgment rule” protects executives, like Redstone, from shareholder suits like this one, according to Lovell. \n\n“The business judgment rule says as long as you act in good faith and as long as you have properly reviewed and considered all the relevant information and data to make a decision, even if your decision turns out bad or turns out to hurt the company, you can’t be sued,” Lovell explained.\n\nRedstone would be protected under this ruling, he said, because it intentionally gives business owners greater freedom in decision making, as long as they act with good intent.\n\nDespite the tumult at the company, Paramount shares are up 14% since the start of the year.\n\nBut veteran telecom attorney O’Neill said that Redstone still doesn’t know if settling the lawsuit will satisfy the FCC enough to approve her $8 billion merger. “Either way she’s roadkill. It’s a bad look,” he said.\n\nState AGs or local DAs could lead the charge\n\nAs far as who would bring the bribery case forward, legal experts said it must be an attorney general or district attorney. Senators do not have this power. Typically the injured party brings a bribery case forward. In this case, O’Neill said the lines of who is hurt by the settlement are murky. \n\n“Arguably, it could be any other broadcast network. It could be any consumer of news. I mean, you would have to show that you are an injured party,” O’Neill said. “It could be a state attorney general who could argue on behalf of the citizens of California.”\n\nRahmani argued, though, that because the blame lies on a federal official – Trump – it would make sense for a state official to bring the case forward. But the bribery crime would be considered a federal crime. He stood firm that “there’s no world where this would be investigated.”\n\nLovell agreed that if Trump was not involved in the bribery case, his DOJ could bring the case forward, but as it stands, it remains unlikely.\n\n“Could it be brought by some state attorney general? Possibly, if people affected could have been part of that state that has bribery laws,” Lovell said. “But I honestly think it’s more of a shot across the bow.”\n\n“It’s a successful way to draw attention to the argument that she may settle in order to curry favor with the administration,” a former FCC official who declined to be identified told TheWrap. \n\n“It’s bad to have the president bully the media and reporters into getting his way,” Rahmani added. “It’s more of a First Amendment free speech issue, independent news court issue, as opposed to this being a bribe that should be prosecuted.”\n\nParamount faces additional pressure as they await the approval of their Skydance merger, which still needs to be pushed through by Carr. Redstone has a tough decision: settle to appease Trump but risk seeming politically compromised. \n\nCritics also warn this legal action may set a dangerous precedent for media outlets being pressured into legal settlements in the future.\n\n“People who care about journalistic freedom might want her to notice that people are paying attention, as a political act,” the former FCC official and lawyer told TheWrap.\n\nO’Neill argued that if the case was brought forward, Redstone would be a pawn in a larger political scheme to expose Trump.\n\n“I don’t think anybody cares about embarrassing Shari Redstone, per se. They care about embarrassing Trump for extortion,” he said. \n\nRedstone’s lawyers are currently in negotiations with Trump’s, but there has been no word of any settlement. \n\nThe deadline for the FCC to approve the Paramount-Skydance merger has been extended to July 9 as the commission reviews how the company’s DEI policies comply with the Trump administration’s insistence on their removal. Legal experts say the company could get a second extension. \n\nThe lawyers agreed that Redstone is in a rare double-bind. Each decision she makes is under a microscope and has implications for future actions between Trump and the media.\n\n“She’s caught up in a thing where her transaction is just bad timing, bad luck and bad timing,” O’Neill said. “It gives Trump leverage not just to screw around with Paramount and CBS, but also to indirectly intimidate everybody else.”","summary":"Legal experts say it is unlikely that Redstone settling with the president is bribery, but she may still be sued\n\n\nThe post Will Shari Redstone Face Bribery Charges if She Settles  Trump&#8217;s $20 Billion ‘60 Minutes’ Lawsuit? appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/shari-redstone-trump-lawsuit-legal-experts-analysis/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Shari-Redstone-and-Donald-Trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-28 00:30:28","author":"Tess Patton","authors":["Tess Patton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.377},{"id":325561902,"title":"Kamala Harris tells audience to 'remember history,' warns current era parallels 'the 1930s'","text":"Leaked video shows former Vice President Kamala Harris warning that the state of the world is eerily similar to the 1930s.
