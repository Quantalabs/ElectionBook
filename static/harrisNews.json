And these cuts are something that I think are a huge mistake.\"\n\nThe foundation has collaborated with USAID for years, and it has spent billions on global development and global health, having made thousands of grants.\n\nWhen the foundation announced in May that Gates would give away almost all his money over the next two decades, it said that \"governments around the world have announced tens of billions of dollars in cuts to aid funding.\"\n\nIn addition to reducing PEPFAR and USAID commitments, Trump's administration has indicated that it will end its backing of the vaccine group Gavi, which the Gates Foundation helped to set up in 1999 and has continued to support.\n\nLast fall, Gates gave $50 million for the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris. \n\nIn late December, Gates had dinner with Trump at the president's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.

The annual “summer camp for billionaires” has historically been a deal-making hotbed. \n\nAllen & Co. is a shareholder in The Free Press, along with more than 30 other investors that include venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and David Sacks, and the former Starbucks chief executive Howard Schultz, according to the Times, which first reported deal talks.\n\nEllison and Weiss have discussed several potential collaborations, including a role for Weiss in shaping CBS News’ editorial direction, though not in a managerial capacity, the Times added, citing two sources.\n\nSkydance declined to comment. Weiss did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nEllison has reportedly “quietly courted” Weiss to bring her on board at CBS News in some high-profile capacity for months. The duo reportedly met in New York City last year, with news of the meeting ruffling feathers at “60 Minutes,” the Status newsletter reported last month\n\nThe latest talks come as Skydance awaits approval from the Federal Communications Commission on its $8 billion merger with CBS News parent Paramount Global. \n\nThe deal has been throttled by President Trump-nominated FCC Chair Brendan Carr as the agency investigates the network’s alleged liberal media bias, as well as its Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives.\n\nLast week, CBS News agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by Trump for allegedly deceptively editing a “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic challenger Kamala Harris shortly before the election.\n\nA CBS News source told The Post that bringing on Weiss won’t change that network’s “woke” drift, citing its culture of pushing back on authority.\n\n“What Ellison needs to understand is that the anchors and the show executives think they can outlast any executive choice,” the source said, citing a revolving door of news executives and news presidents in the last few years. \n\nThe person descibed a “drag-your-feet” culture, in which new executives try to make bold moves, but they are ultimately ignored by the staff, who pays lip-service to them and wait until they’re pushed out. \n\n“Bari Weiss will have an axe in her head in three minutes,” the person concluded.\n\nIn the spring, longtime “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens quit in protest, citing a lack of editorial freedoms. His boss, CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon, followed suit.\n\nWeiss quit the Times opinions sections because she felt that the Gray Lady’s left-wing culture was hostile to moderate and conservative voices.\n\nShe launched The Free Press with her wife, former Times journalist Nellie Bowles, and Weiss’ sister Suzy Weiss, a former New York Post reporter.\n\nThe trio started the publication as an alternative to left-leaning outlets and sought to cover current events with a “common sense” point of view, tackling subjects such as anti-Semitism on college campuses, the debate over transgender rights in women’s sports, media bias and wokism.\n\nWeiss has championed stories that shed a light on antisemitism across America and Europe following Hamas’ October 7 massacre in Israel, as well as developing a podcast series called “The Witch Trials of J. K. Rowling,” featuring interviews with the “Harry Potter” author, and others, over her controversial views on transgender people.\n\nShe also hired veteran NPR journalist Uri Berliner, who resigned from the liberal outlet after being suspended for criticizing how the mainstream media — and his employer — had lost the public’s trust by approaching stories with a progressive bend.\n\nIt also hosts a series of live events that dig into hot topics such as immrigration and crime.\n\nAs of last summer, The Free Press had more than 50 employees and offices on both coasts. \n\nThe site has more than 136,000 subscribers paying around $8 a month, Axios reported in late December. The Times estimated that the site has roughly 1.5 million free and paid subscribers in total.","summary":"Sources speculate that Weiss could play a major role in reshaping CBS News, which has been plagued by criticism of a left-wing bias.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/11/media/skydance-reportedly-in-early-talks-to-buy-bari-weiss-the-free-press/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/108015773.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bkB8uDiE-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-11 21:35:14","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":340757864,"title":"Voters label Democrats ‘out of touch’ and ‘weak’ in latest troubling poll ahead of 2026 midterms","text":"Voters have labeled Democrats as “out of touch” and “weak” in the latest troubling poll ahead of the 2026 midterms. \n\nMore than seven months after former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 election loss to President Donald Trump, Democrats have had time to reflect on where they went wrong. \n\nOne criticism that circulated in the wake of the presidential election was that Democrats had shifted their focus away from the working class, a segment of the population to which Trump had appealed. \n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said in a biting statement, “It should come as no great surprise that a Democratic Party which has abandoned working class people would find that the working class has abandoned them.”\n\nAs Democrats have taken up more social issues in recent years such as transgender rights and Diversity, Equity and Inclusion initiatives, people from both sides of the aisle have accused the party of being too woke. \n\nAnd voters in a new poll conducted by the Democratic super PAC Unite the Country seem to agree, calling Democrats “woke,” as well as “out of touch” and “weak,” The Hill, which obtained the data, reported Friday. \n\nTrump has repeatedly called former President Joe Biden “weak” while trying to promote strength. Biden, now 82, dropped out of the 2024 election following concerns about his physical and mental fitness. \n\nThe new poll isn’t the first time voters have taken this view of the Democratic Party.\n\nPolitico reported in December 2024, citing research by the progressive group Navigator Research, voters who previously supported Democrats described the party as weak and too focused on diversity and the small group of elites in this country. \n\nUnite the Country’s poll, which was conducted between May and June, also found enthusiasm within the party has continued to weaken after the 2024 election. \n\nDemocratic strategist Rodell Mollineau, a senior adviser to the super PAC, told The Hill, “This is the reality of the perception of us as a party, and until we accept that, it’s going to be hard to move forward.”\n\nWhether or not the Democrats can shift voter perception will be seen in the 2026 midterm elections. \n\nThere will be 35 Senate seats up for election, including 22 currently held by Republicans. If they are able to gain four seats, Democrats can take control of the upper chamber. All House seats will also be up for election in 2026. Republicans currently control the House 220-212.","summary":"In the wake of Democrats’ 2024 election losses, the party has faced several criticisms, including accusations that it has abandoned working-class voters","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/voters-democrats-weak-2026-election-midterms-b2787632.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/11/21/55/Voting.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QyvhK1HN-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-11 21:34:30","author":"Rachel Dobkin","authors":["Rachel Dobkin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":340745916,"title":"Casey Anthony, Dubbed ‘Most Hated Mom in America,’ Seen in ‘Situationship’ with Former Cop and Gun Shop Owner","text":"CASEY Anthony is back in the spotlight, this time sharing beers with a gun shop owner and ex-cop in a rumored “situationship.”\n\nAnthony has been spotted in New Hampshire getting close to a bearded man later identified as Ben Beauchemin.\n\nBeauchemin runs Wicked Weaponry, a gun store in Hooksett, New Hampshire, just outside Manchester.\n\nThe pair were seen Wednesday night enjoying food and drinks together at a local sports bar.\n\nPhotos show the two smiling and relaxed during their night out.\n\nSources said the two aren’t officially a couple but are referring to their bond as a “situationship.”\n\nAnthony, now 39, gained infamy during her high-profile 2011 murder trial in Florida, which ended in her acquittal.\n\nShe has been accused of killing her 2-year-old daughter Caylee, whose body was found wrapped in duct tape inside a laundry bag.\n\nAnthony kept the toddler’s disappearance quiet for over a month before police got involved, igniting public outrage and media frenzy.\n\nThe explosive case captivated the country and turned Anthony into a national pariah.\n\nNow, she is rebuilding her personal life, and has found company in Beauchemin.\n\nBeauchemin previously served in the US Army Rangers and was a police officer before opening his firearms store.\n\nHe also skydives in his free time and was recently featured in a January 2024 New York Times article about undecided voters.\n\n“I have a lot of liberal friends, and I sometimes don’t wanna tell them that I own a gun store,” Beauchemin told the Times.\n\n“There’s a part of me that believes it would be business suicide to admit that I am liberal and I just happen to really love the Second Amendment.”\n\nThe outlet noted he supports gun rights as well as women’s reproductive freedom.\n\nHis town of Hooksett leaned toward Trump in the last election, while nearby Manchester went to Kamala Harris.\n\nIt’s unclear where Beauchemin ultimately landed on the ballot.\n\nBeauchemin’s family said they were blindsided by the news of his involvement with Anthony, per TMZ.\n\nAfter the images surfaced, Beauchemin reportedly deactivated his Facebook account and stopped responding to his family.\n\nOn Thursday, Anthony was spotted alone, shopping at a nearby T.J. Maxx in the area.\n\nJust last fall, she had split from another man, a married boyfriend named Tyson Ray Rhodes, 49.\n\nAnthony recently rebranded herself as a legal advocate for women and LGBTQ rights . \n\nShe has also positioned herself as anti-Trump.\n\nInfamous Case\n\nCaylee Anthony was last seen alive on June 27, 2008, when she left her grandparents’ Orlando home with her mother, Casey.\n\nWeeks passed with no trace of the 2-year-old until Casey’s mother, Cindy Anthony, discovered her daughter’s deserted car in a parking lot and made a horrifying 911 call.\n\n“There is something wrong,” she told the dispatcher. “I found my daughter’s car today and it smells like there’s been a dead body in the damn car.”\n\nCaylee’s skeletal remains were discovered months later, in December 2008, inside a trash bag dumped in a wooded area behind the Anthony family home. \n\nThe body was so badly decomposed that medical examiners couldn’t determine the exact cause of death.\n\nThe prosecution charged Casey with allegedly using chloroform to sedate her daughter, then suffocating her with duct tape, and abandoning her body close to her parents’ residence.\n\nGerardo Bloise, a retired crime scene investigator involved in the case, previously mentioned to The U.S. Sun that the odor emanating from Casey’s car was undeniable.\n\n“I put the vehicle in the garage, and when I opened the driver’s door, man, that blast hit me and I immediately recognized the smell,” he said. \n\n“I’ve been dealing with decomposing bodies for years.”\n\nHe said the odor intensified as he checked the rest of the car, and became overwhelming when he opened the trunk.\n\n“That’s when I knew there was a body inside this car [at one time] and it had been in the trunk,” Bloise recalled.\n\n“I relayed the information to detectives and continued to examine the car for the next three months.”\n\nBloise said he remains convinced that Casey was responsible for Caylee’s death.\n\n“In my opinion, based on what we found inside the car, what investigators found on Casey’s computer […] it’s common sense that Casey was behind this,” he said.\n\nHe believes she may have used chloroform to put her daughter to sleep so she could go out and party, but gave her too much and panicked when the child didn’t wake up.\n\nDespite the circumstantial evidence, Casey was acquitted in 2011 after a jury found there wasn’t enough proof to convict her beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe verdict that stunned the nation and sparked international outrage and she was dubbed “the most hated mom in America.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCASEY Anthony is back in the spotlight, this time sharing beers with&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Casey Anthony, Dubbed &#8216;Most Hated Mom in America,&#8217; Seen in &#8216;Situationship&#8217; with Former Cop and Gun Shop Owner first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/casey-anthony-dubbed-most-hated-mom-in-america-seen-in-situationship-with-former-cop-and-gun-shop-owner/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/‘Most-hated-mom-in-America-Casey-Anthony-spotted-in-‘situationship.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 21:18:34","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.102},{"id":340745542,"title":"Evangelicals for Harris posts apology for misusing Billy Graham’s image for their politics","text":"A political organization called Evangelicals for Harris, now renamed Evangelicals for America following Kamala Harris’ catastrophic presidential election loss in 2024, has posted online a multipage apology for improperly using Billy Graham’s image for their politics.\n\nThe organization had used images of the late Christian leader who was in the confidence of presidents for the last 50 years in promoting Harris, who advocated deliberately for the transgender and LGBT ideologies that many Christians find unbiblical and objectionable.\n\nThe Billy Graham Evangelical Associated pointed out the misuse, and abuse of copyright law, and a year later the Harris organization has apologized.\n\nAmong the ads released:\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Evangelicals For Harris drops their first media spot TODAY in an effort to win over some of those “on-the-fence” Conservative Evangelicals in swing states who are lukewarm when it comes to Donald Trump.

Graham without permission and claimed they weren’t trying to “give the impression that Rev. Graham would have taken a side in publicly supporting one political candidate over another.”\n\nThe group concedes that Graham “never politicized the Gospel of Jesus Christ or the works he created through BGEA.”\n\n“We appreciate the spirit in which BGEA has approached this matter … and we affirm its intellectual property rights including copyright in these videos, and its missional interest in protecting Rev. Graham’s legacy.”\n\nIt continued, “We have taken down and will not repost our ads that incorporated video clips of Rev. Billy Graham…”\n\nNot the Bee explained, “The long and short of it is that they used these clips of Billy Graham, but didn’t get permission from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) to use them in their political attack ads. To avoid being sued into oblivion for lifting these clips and using them for partisan purposes to support an abortion-loving Democratic candidate, they’ve apologized.”\n\nWhen the dispute arose, WND had reported on Billy Graham’s lifelong interactions with presidents, of both political parties:\n\nHe was offered government posts by Presidents Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon, and politely said no.\n\nHarry S. Truman not only met with Graham, he received him as his Independence, Missouri, home. Dwight Eisenhower asked him about sending troops into Little Rock during a time of civil unrest. John F. Kennedy met with Graham before he was inaugurated.\nGraham was invited to the Johnson family ranch multiple times, and spent more than 20 nights in the White House during his presidency. Graham had known Nixon for years, and the president often asked Graham to pray with him. Gerald Ford explained, “I’ve heard the comments from some sources that Billy mixes politics with religion. I never felt that and I don’t think that thousands and thousands of people who listen to him felt that.”\nJimmy Carter was an honorary chair of an Atlanta Crusade by Billy Graham back in his day, Ronald Reagan once said, “It was through Billy Graham that I found myself praying even more than on a daily basis … and that in the position I held, that my prayers more and more were to give me the wisdom to make decisions that would serve God and be pleasing to Him.” George H. W. Bush called Graham “an inspiration in my life.”\n\nBill Clinton credited Billy Graham with refusing to racially segregate a crusade audience. George W. Bush said a turning point in his faith came during a private talk with Billy Graham in 1985. Graham said he was pleased to have had Barack Obama visit in his home.\n\nAt the time, Franklin Graham, Billy Graham’s son and now chief of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, said, “The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris. They even developed a political ad trying to use my father Billy Graham’s image to help promote her—or rather to try to make Donald J. Trump look bad.\n\n“They are trying to mislead people. Maybe they don’t know that my father was a firm supporter of President Trump in 2016. He appreciated the conservative values and policies of President Trump, and if he were alive today, my father’s views and opinions would not have changed.\n\n“President Trump isn’t perfect—none of us are—but I believe he has changed over the years. This recent assassination attempt has had a huge impact on him—and I thank God that his life was spared.”","summary":"'The long and short of it is that they used these clips of Billy Graham, but didn't get permission … To avoid being sued into oblivion for lifting these clips and using them for partisan purposes to support an abortion-loving Democratic candidate, they've apologized'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/07/evangelicals-harris-posts-apology-misusing-billy-grahams-image/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/billy-graham-600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 20:28:02","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.314},{"id":340734180,"title":"AT&T Lily Undresses In A Bed Of Flowers, FSU's Iconic Cowgirl Is Pumped For Football & What A National Anthem!","text":"While the Libs are busy putting toddlers to work at a weed farm out in lawless California, us sane Americans snuck right on by to ANOTHER Friday. They let us do it again! Idiots! How dumb can they be? The answer is, \"infinitely dumb,\" for those wondering. Their idiocy knows no bounds. Sad for them. Great for us! Let's make this one count. Welcome to a Friday Nightcaps – the one where we gear up for college football season with famous FSU cowgirl Jenn Sterger, and go from there. What else? I've got the best of the rest from a solid week of #content, AT&T Lily is back with more behind-the-scenes footage, Michelle Obama and Elaine from Seinfeld are being beyond bitchy and insufferable, and we've got a brand-new sign erected at the sight of the most insane golf course beatdown I've ever seen. What a moment for this course. The local economy is about to THRIVE in this Canadian town. Grab you some fries for National Fry Day, wash it down with a free slurpee for 7/11 Day, and THEN settle in for a Friday 'Cap! Are these two the most insufferable women on the planet? I'm quite sure we've done this one before, but I'm gonna need to go ahead and recycle my Mount Rushmore of Fries today. Lord knows there ain't anything else going on. I'd also accept: Chick-Fil-A, although the end pieces of waffle fries are disgusting, so it's a slippery little slope, and … sweet potato! That's right. Some people scoff at sweet potato fries, but, done right, they are electric. Dip those bad boys in some marshmallow sauce and you have yourself a damn party. Plus, you save on calories (not really, but it makes you feel like less of a fat slob). Anyway, down to business … Hate to start a big Friday class with Michelle Obama and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, but this little bitch-fest deserves a second look: What a week of #content! Incredible conversation here from two of the wealthiest women in America. To sit there, with straight faces, and talk about how tough you have it – when you're both worth over $300 million – is batshit crazy. It's so delusional, even for a pair of insufferable Libs. And yes, I know Elaine is worth way more than $250 million given her family is LOADED. Believe me, I went to school with her son – I'm well aware. PS: how about beta boy Craig just sitting there and taking it? Doesn't even say a word. Doesn't push back at all. What a simp. Perfect for the Democrat Party. The good news here is that we no longer have to worry about Michelle Obama running for president, because she's clearly an idiot. I used to think she could seriously win. Not after that. I think we're safe. The bad news is that Seinfeld just became a bit of a bummer of a watch. Sad. OK, let's get to the best #content from a big week. Alberta Springs Golf Course bats leadoff today! AT&T Lily takes us behind the scenes, Travis' transformation & what an anthem! A surprisingly strong week, given the time of year. Nice work, internet! Couple thoughts … 1. Sydney Sweeney is literally the only thing that could make me go see a superhero movie at 32. Unless Tobey Maguire reprises his role as Spider-Man. That's it. 2. Is Kamala Harris dumber than Michelle and Elaine? Bacon as a spice? What does that even mean? I truly don't understand. 3. NASCAR's Natalie Decker refuses to stop posting thirst. What a comeback for her this summer. 4. Jenn Sterger! The OG influencer that turned everyone on thanks to some timely B-roll is ready to rock and roll this season. Camp starts in two weeks. We've got Week 0 in about six weeks. Like I always say, NOW is the time to get those summer chores taken care of. Let's be smart, fellas. 5. Emily Mayfield! I believe this is her first time back in this class in at least a year. What a cameo. Think she's ready for Baker to cook this season? Lord knows I am. Speaking of the NFL, let's go ahead and rapid-fire this final class of the week into a big Friday night. First up? Let's go ahead and check in with Travis Kelce! Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaa Nellie! What a transformation! I knew Travis was a different dude since he started banging Taylor, but it's jarring when you see it laid out like this. Impressive stuff. I don't particularly like either version, but at least the last one was good at football. I ain't TOUCHING him in my fantasy drafts next month. No shot. Won't make that mistake again. Next? Before we hit the sunflower fields with Lily, let's belt out quite possibly the worst rendition of the national anthem … ever? My God. Is that autotune? Is that what we're going for here? Could you imagine being in the park for that, and listening live? I'd walk out. I'd rather listen to Roseanne Barr sing it for 24 hours straight than ever have to sit through that again. At least she'd use her actual voice. Well, on second thought … Yep. Scratch that. I take it all back. What a moment in time that was. An all-timer. OK, that's it for today – and this week! I know Joe covered AT&T Lily's philanthropic efforts earlier this week, but she gave the fans a behind-the-scenes look at how the sausage was made yesterday, and it's probably worthy of another look.

Ngritja e tij filloi në vitin 2014 në Ministrinë Gjermane të Mbrojtjes, ku Von der Leyen, ministrja e atëhershme, e vuri re si një sociolog të ri të aftë dhe të gatshëm për përpjekje mbinjerëzore.

Në Bruksel, ai përshkruhet si një “vrasës i heshtur”, një burrë që mban gjithmonë atlete dhe një dosje të rëndësishme, por rrallë shfaqet në publik. Ai është i martuar, baba i dy fëmijëve dhe për vite me radhë një figurë kyçe në hije, tani pothuajse një “nënkryetar” i Komisionit Evropian.\n\nLidhjet me SHBA-në\n\nPushteti i tij deri më tani ishte bazuar në lidhje të ngushta me administratën e Joe Biden. Që prej fillimit të presidencës së Joe Biden, Seibert ka luajtur rolin e ndërmjetësit informal por jashtëzakonisht efektiv midis Komisionit Evropian dhe Shtëpisë së Bardhë, duke ndihmuar në harmonizimin e qëndrimeve transatlantike për çështje si sanksionet ndaj Rusisë, teknologjitë strategjike dhe mbrojtja ekonomike. Ai shihej si një garantues i marrëdhënies speciale midis von der Leyen dhe Washingtonit, një figurë që ka përdorur kapacitetin e tij diplomatik dhe lidhjet personale për të ndërtuar një kanal të qëndrueshëm komunikimi, që shpesh e anashkalon burokracinë tradicionale të Brukselit.\n\nKjo afërsi me Washingtonin i ka dhënë Seibertit jo vetëm peshë në vendimmarrje, por edhe një status të veçantë si “njeriu i Amerikës në Bruksel”, duke e forcuar më tej pozitën e von der Leyen si një nga liderët më të orientuar drejt perëndimit në BE. Megjithatë, rikthimi i Donald Trump në skenën politike amerikane, me qasjen e tij më skeptike ndaj Bashkimit Evropian dhe multilateralizmit në përgjithësi, e vë në pikëpyetje qëndrueshmërinë e kësaj dinamike. Nëse Seibert e ka ndërtuar pushtetin e tij mbi themelet e një aleance të fortë me demokratët në Uashington, atëherë ndryshimi i administratës në Shtetet e Bashkuara mund ta kufizojë hapësirën e tij për ndikim. Në një moment kritik për të ardhmen e marrëdhënieve transatlantike, roli i Seibertit është më i pasigurt se kurrë.","summary":"Brukseli është mësuar me njerëz me ndikim në hije, por pak prej tyre frymëzojnë aq shumë magjepsje sa Bjoern Seibert, shefi i stafit të Presidentes së Komisionit Evropian Ursula von der Leyen.

Why did the paper of record report on hacked materials it obtained from a quasi-anonymous online race scientist, given its prior refusal to report on other hacked materials of questionable provenance? And most importantly for our purposes — even if we concede that Mamdani’s college application was indeed newsworthy and acknowledge that journalists’ sources will at times include people with retrograde or abhorrent views — why was the Times deferential to the source at the expense of accuracy, obscuring his actual beliefs and agreeing to refer to him by a pseudonym even though his identity had previously been reported elsewhere?\nThis latter note may seem like a minor quibble, but it points to a broader phenomenon: the subtle creep of race science into mainstream political discourse. The Times obtained Mamdani’s Columbia application from “an intermediary who goes by the name Crémieux on Substack and X,” whom reporters described as “an academic who opposes affirmative action and writes often about IQ and race.” A quick Google search is all it takes to reveal that the person behind the Crémieux account is almost certainly Jordan Lasker, a lapsed academic and ardent advocate of eugenics. It’s technically true that Lasker/Crémieux “writes often about IQ and race” in the same way that it’s technically true that Donald Trump “speaks often about immigration.” It would be far more accurate to say that Lasker writes about how Black people are inherently and congenitally less intelligent than white people. \nEgregious as it was, this incident is not isolated, nor did it come out of nowhere. The idea that race and IQ are connected — what’s known as “race realism” or “human biodiversity” — has become conventional wisdom on the right in the years since Trump was first elected. The notion of “human biodiversity” underpins the Trump administration’s efforts to do away with both affirmative action and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. If success is downstream from intelligence and intelligence is determined by race and heredity rather than access and opportunity, then inequality is the product of biology, not policy. And if inequality is the product of biology, any attempts to eradicate it will be ineffective at best and, at worst, will elevate the inferior at the expense of their superiors. This is not a new argument; it is the thesis of Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray’s controversial 1994 bestseller The Bell Curve and, more broadly, the intellectual heir of the centuries-old tradition of scientific racism.\nProminent liberal institutions have — for the most part, anyway — not yet endorsed the 21st-century iteration of race science, but they have helped launder it into the mainstream nonetheless by legitimizing its proponents while simultaneously obscuring their actual beliefs. In the wake of the 2024 presidential election, Democrats have scrambled to come up with an explanation for both Kamala Harris’ loss and the Republican Party’s gains with voters of color. The prevailing opinion among a certain cohort of liberal commentators is that voters are tired of identity politics and want politicians to focus on kitchen-table issues. This was already the prevailing opinion before the election, but now it has a flashy new title: Abundance. The idea, as presented by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson in their new book of the same name, is that Democrats should be the party of more: more housing, more jobs, more opportunity, more clean energy, more prosperity. But to get there, they argue, we must do away with onerous regulations that impede progress. \nThe Abundance tent is an intentionally big one. It’s partly a bid to win over disaffected voters who defected from the Democratic Party, as well as conservatives who feel abandoned or betrayed by MAGA’s economic policies. In this sense, Abundance isn’t too different from Democrats’ post-January 6th efforts to woo Never-Trump Republicans by pivoting to the center. But Abundance liberals are also seemingly entering into political alliances with race scientists.\nTake, for example, Thompson’s appearance on Richard Hanania’s podcast. Hanania, for those who are unfamiliar (I’m so jealous of you by the way), is an erstwhile member of the tech-right and author of The Origins of Woke, a 2023 book about how “wokeness” originated with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Years before he was a published author, Hanania blogged under the name Richard Hoste. Shielded by his nom de plume, he described himself as a race realist, called for the compulsory sterilization of “low IQ” people, and described himself as an opponent of “miscegenation” and “race-mixing.” Hanania apologized for these writings after they were unearthed by HuffPost, saying they were from a time when he “truly sucked.” None of this affected Hanania’s career much, in part because of conservatives’ opposition to cancel culture and in part because the tech-right is almost entirely made up of race realists. \nHanania and Thompson may seem like strange bedfellows. But Hanania’s relationship with the tech-right has fractured since Trump returned to office. Last December, Hanania took Elon Musk’s side in a fractious online debate over H-1B visas. Hanania, after all, is a race realist, not a popular racist. The majority of H-1B recipients are from India and China. I won’t get into the intricacies of race scientists’ intellectual hierarchies, but suffice to say they believe some Asian groups are smarter than some white groups, with variations based on ethnicity and caste. (This is in fact a common defense among the human biodiversity crowd; they can’t possibly be racist if they believe East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews are the intellectual elite.) Hanania is a defender of “elite human capital” — also the title of his forthcoming book — no matter their skin color, which means he supports high-skilled immigration even if, as the nativist right claims, it comes at the expense of white American workers. \nThe nativists seem to have won that debate, at least for now. Musk is no longer in Trump’s ear, while Stephen Miller and other America First types continue to dictate Trump’s immigration policies. Hanania told Semafor’s Ben Smith that he left Marc Andreessen’s Signal group chat — which Hanania helped fill with prominent right-wingers — in 2023 after it became a “vehicle for groupthink.” He even claims to regret voting for Trump. He is now on a sort of apology tour. He has disavowed many of his former allies, described MAGA as having an IQ problem, and has accused Trump of “unprecedented” corruption. It makes sense, then, that Hanania would be looking to forge new alliances. \nThompson’s willingness to engage with Hanania, on the other hand, is a bit harder to parse. Abundance is best described as a book by liberals for liberals; it’s a roadmap for a sort of utopian tech-futurism. The book is both about the nitty-gritty of deregulation — Thompson and Klein argue that liberals’ affinity for bureaucracy and red tape has stalled growth, leading to a shortage of housing, jobs, and overall prosperity — and an effort to remake the Democratic Party in the wake of the 2024 election. \nAs part of their promotional tour, Thompson and Klein have put forth a theory on why Kamala Harris lost the popular vote. The Abundance authors are part of a growing chorus of liberal technocrats who claim that Harris’ deference to “The Groups” came at the expense of appealing to actual voters who are primarily concerned with the cost of living and are put off by Democrats’ emphasis on race and identity. To get the “solarpunk future” of Thompson and Klein’s dreams, Democrats must not only do away with overzealous regulation but also eschew culture war issues and the nonprofits that espouse them. Still, an abundant future is not a nationalist one — in fact, it relies on an influx of immigrant laborers with specialized skills, or what Thompson has described as “immigration-as-recruitment.” This future dovetails nicely with Hanania’s desire to eradicate DEI, as well as his support of high-skilled immigration. \nKlein and Thompson, to be clear, are not race scientists, proponents of human biodiversity, or cryptofascists. They are avowed liberals — Klein is a Times columnist and Thompson worked at The Atlantic until recently — who are trying to salvage what’s left of the Democratic Party by giving it a pro-deregulation facelift. Unlike Trump’s mass deportations and total dismantling of the federal bureaucracy in the name of ending DEI, Abundance is not underpinned by scientific racism or eugenic ideology. But its figureheads certainly don’t stand up against it, and may even think that doing so is a waste of time better spent forging alliances with people across the ideological spectrum.\nIn a few months, Klein and Thompson will headline an Abundance conference organized in part by the Foundation for American Innovation, a conservative think tank that helped co-author Project 2025. Abundance means more of everything, including more of the tired Democratic strategy of forging a coalition by making overtures to repentant conservatives — including unrepentant racists who see entire swaths of the population as inherently and biologically inferior.","summary":"The New York Times' recent report on Zohran Mamdani's Columbia University application raised a lot of questions, such as: In what universe does this fall under the umbrella of news that's fit to print?

Now Trump's doomed them all","text":"A tiny county that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump has now been doomed by his flagship policy.\n\nA staggering 85 percent of Knox County in Kentucky backed the president in the election in November, with just 14 percent wanting Kamala Harris sworn in.\n\nBut just eight months later they may be regretting it, as his Big Beautiful Bill looks set to tear apart their everyday lives.\n\nThe policy looks set to strip $1trillion from Medicaid leaving millions without insurance that could decimate healthcare systems in rural areas.\n\nKnox County, which has 30,000 people in it, has 38 percent of its total population on the system, including over 7,000 children.\n\nNow locals have spoken out, and feel betrayed by Trump, who promoted the bill as a 'win for workers, farmers, and America's future.'\n\nExperts have also weighed in and pointed out it leaves up to 17million Americans without any health cover.\n\nDr Osama Hashmi, a dermatologist in Atlanta, told the Daily Mail: 'People think of healthcare as a free-market system and it's really not. It affects everybody.' \n\nFor Knox County resident Teresa McNab, whose husband fell ill and fatally started seizing on the floor of their home in 2021, Medicaid helped save their family.\n\nNow, she and her daughter's coverage is being threatened by Trump's prized bill, which requires workers to work at least 80 hours per month to qualify for it.\n\nFor the line cook, who also cares for her mother, it's nearly impossible, she told The Telegraph.\n\n'I take care of my daughter, I take care of my 78-year-old mom, I take care of our home, and half the time I don't even have time for myself,' she said. \n\nFor Lisa Garrison, she would not have been able to afford her daughter's eye condition that would have cost her $180,000 without Medicaid. \n\n'You will be left without hospitals that can serve you near the hollers, without affordable or state-provided healthcare and SNAP benefits will also be affected.'\n\nShe added on her Facebook page earlier this month: 'This bill is atrocious and dangerous. This bill will cause people to die.'\n\nDr Hashmi agrees, adding to the Daily Mail that it will '100 percent lead to death'.\n\nKentucky faces the highest number of rural hospital closures in the country due to the bill, which will cut $28million from the Bluegrass State's program in 10 years. \n\nThirty-five hospitals in Kentucky are at risk, Democrat Governor Andy Beshear said, and 200,000 in the state could lose coverage.\n\nThe Center for Healthcare Quality and Payment Reform found that the Bluegrass State has 19 hospitals that already have 'losses on services', which will only get worse when hospitals have to eat the cost of Medicaid cuts for patients unable to pay. \n\nIt also found that 16 are definitely at risk of closing, with four at the immediate risk level, a June 2025 report found. \n\n'This bill risks 200,000 Kentuckians' lives, the jobs of 20,000 healthcare workers, 35 rural hospitals, and our economy,' the governor said in a statement. 'The passage of the 'big, ugly bill' marks a sad day for our country and commonwealth.\n\n'Kentucky deserves better.' \n\nThe Medicaid cuts don't go into effect until January 1, 2027, but Hashmi said recipients will feel the effects much sooner and possibly within the next 12 months. \n\nHospitals and other healthcare providers in Atlanta, where he works, have already begun discussing whether or not they will continue to accept Medicaid as they 'decrease [their] reliance' on it ahead of the upcoming federal funding losses. \n\n'That planning starts now,' Hashmi, who volunteers and works at a private practice, said. 'Patients will see the effects in 12 months.'\n\nAlthough those who lose their coverage will feel the effects the fastest, the federal cuts also hurt those using private insurance. \n\nAs hospitals and doctors' offices close in rural areas, patients will be forced to go to urban areas and even metropolises to receive care, which ups wait times, decreases the quality of care as doctors have to see more patients, and threatens the infrastructure of healthcare. \n\n'We already have an access problem in the US,' Hashmi said.\n\nMore so: 'We all pay into this,' the dermatologist said. Without federal funding, the states will have to subsidize hospitals to keep them afloat or the facilities risk bankruptcy. \n\nThis means the 50 states, especially those that heavily rely on Medicaid funding, will have to raise taxes for residents. \n\n'State systems are going to be severely disrupted,' Hashmi said. \n\nThe debt hospitals take on for low-income patients will also rise, not just because ill person cannot pay them, but they will now take longer to seek care. \n\nThis means, when they do seek medical attention, they'll be in later stages of diseases and illnesses that will require more advanced care, especially for cancer patients, who might seek help after it's too late. \n\nHashmi said he has many patients where he can cure their skin cancer by simply removing it if it's detected early, but for those who wait longer, it might not be so simple. \n\nHe fears more Medicaid patients will wait until it's an emergency to seek help. \n\n'I think they should be really worried,' he said of the cuts. \n\nMiller Morris, a women's health researcher, said: 'Medicaid isn't just a line item, it's a lifeline.' \n\nAnd the cuts affect organizations like Planned Parenthood, which provides STD testing, prenatal and postpartum services, and birth control to patients. \n\n'Cutting these services means millions of low-income women, especially in rural areas, will lose access to basic, often life-saving care.' \n\nLeadership Consultant, Harold Reynolds, of Chicago, who works with clients in rural areas, called the bill a '$1trillion mistake.' \n\n'Whether the motive is fiscal conservatism or opposition to the [Affordable Care Act], the result of these cuts is not a more efficient system. It's a more fragile one,' he told Daily Mail.\n\n'We're not just talking about trimming excess, we're pulling funding from hospitals and providers that serve everyone.' \n\nMany experts also told Daily Mail that the miseducation surrounding Medicaid - which is also called Obamacare - very much could have played a role in the support and confusion surrounding this bill. \n\nMany people whose healthcare was threatened under the bill had no idea, as they didn't realize their services were Medicaid, which now risks the health and safety of children, adults, and the elderly. \n\n'Supporters justify this by pointing to $56billion in 'improper payments' in 2023. But what they don't explain is that the vast majority of those payments are not fraud,' Reynolds said. \n\n'According to federal data, only about 1-4 percent of those improper payments are suspected fraud. The rest are paperwork errors, billing mismatches, or technical violations.\n\n'What's really being cut is the funding that pays for maternity wards, ambulance services, emergency rooms, and nursing home care. Medicaid isn't just a benefit for the poor. It's a revenue stream for hospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities. \n\n'Gutting it weakens the whole system,' Reynolds concluded.\n\nAnd if rural communities are impacted significantly more than urban areas and cities, it could become a legal problem for the Trump Administration, Attorney Ben Michael, of Michael & Associates, told Daily Mail. \n\n'With eligibility requirements becoming stricter, and if rural areas are more negatively impacted as others, that may be grounds for legal action in regard to discrimination,' he said. \n\nBut for now, Americans brace for the inevitable and pray for a more equitable solution.","summary":"A small town that voted overwhelmingly for Donald Trump has now been doomed by the president.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14894547/small-maga-town-trump-voters.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/11/15/100226625-0-image-a-10_1752245433118.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 17:04:44","author":"Alyssa Guzman,Editor","authors":["Alyssa Guzman","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.635},{"id":340690850,"title":"'I voted for none of this': Podcaster who championed Trump in 2024 unloads on his 'boy'","text":"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump and his advisers not only rallied his hardcore MAGA base — they also made a point of reaching out to independents, swing voters, Latinos, the Manosphere and Gen-Z men.

The Truth Is Complicated.' \n\nDespite previously describing the issue as a conspiracy theory only found in the right-wing, the Times' latest article now condemns 'Democrat politicians' for suggesting Aurora residents and conservatives were merely 'crying wolf.' \n\nIn the latest article shared this month, Aurora resident Cindy Romero told her story of filming Tren de Aragua gang members loitering outside her apartment, straddling guns and threatening residents. \n\nThe footage went viral, and Romero - a self-described 'lifelong Democrat' - joined Trump on stage as she said her city had become overwhelmed. \n\nThe issue was fueled by an influx of 40,000 Venezuelans who had been bussed to Denver, Colorado in just two years, taking advantage of its sanctuary city status to live free in hotels. \n\nWhen their time in the makeshift shelters was up, large numbers moved to Aurora, as it was a cheaper place to live. \n\nThe mass migration allowed Tren de Aragua to gain traction in Aurora, where it set up drug trafficking rings and was quickly involved in a number of violent crimes. \n\nDanielle Jurinsky, a Republican city councilwoman who often shared Romero's footage, was cited in the Times' story in September for having 'pointed to Romero's video as evidence that large numbers of Tren de Aragua members had come with the influx of migrants.' \n\nWhile saying this month that this moment was used by Democrats to 'cry wolf' over the issue, just 10 months earlier the Times was downplaying the very same issue. \n\nThe outlet spoke with Yorman Fernandez, a 29-year-old Venezuelan who lived at one of the properties it now admits were overran with gang members. \n\nFernandez minimized the issue and said he was the victim of stereotyping, 'because of one or two Venezuelans who wanted to do something wrong, we are now all accused of something.' \n\nBut now, that level of 'one or two' migrants ruining the reputation of all others is not so easily dismissed. \n\nThe Times in-depth new piece gives bloodcurdling details of life in Aurora - including at the apartment complexes named as Tren de Aragua nests by Trump.\n\nThe night Venezuela's dictator president Nicolas Maduro won re-election last July, a 10 minute gun battle erupted inside Romero's apartment building.\n\nGangsters brought motorbikes into apartments and revved them at all hours, had noisy parties that went all night and knocked holes in walls so apartments whose electricity had been cut off could be powered by others still on the grid.\n\nDowntown Aurora was described by a local who spoke to the paper as now having the same uneasy, threatening vibe as Venezuela itself. \n\nThe outlet noted this month that 'immigration arrests in Colorado are up more than 250 percent since Trump took office, but that has not ended the presence of young men with guns in Aurora’s downtown.' \n\n'The more central Aurora became to Trump’s anti-immigrant rhetoric, the greater the temptation among Democratic politicians and activists to wave away talk of gang activity in the city as a right-wing hallucination,' the Times wrote this month. \n\n'But their refusal to acknowledge the violence that some residents were seeing with their own eyes came off not as reassurance but as erasure.","summary":"The esteemed paper has contradicted its own recent reporting about the hell of living in Aurora, Colorado.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14896915/New-York-Times-admits-migrant-conspiracy-theory-scolded-Donald-Trump-TRUE.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/11/14/100221693-0-image-m-16_1752239600549.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2024/08/29/8352342017037845877/1024x576_MP4_8352342017037845877.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-11 15:42:12","author":"Editor,Will Potter","authors":["Editor","Will Potter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.319},{"id":340661156,"title":"Charles Barkley offers shock take on pro-Trump Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl's potential senate run","text":"Auburn alum and former Republican Charles Barkley would support Tigers basketball coach Bruce Pearl's U.S. Senatorial campaign if the outspoken supporter of Donald Trump and Israel ever ran for the office in Alabama.\n\n'I respect and trust him,' the basketball legend and Inside the NBA co-host told AL.com. 'I just told him to do what he wants to do.'\n\nPearl and the Tigers are coming off a Final Fourth berth and he recently made waves by publicly supporting Trump's decision to bomb Iran's nuclear facilities amid ongoing tensions between that country and Israel.\n\n'Obviously, he's made Auburn basketball relevant, which makes me happy,' Barkley said. 'I said, 'Hey, man, as much as I love you being the head basketball coach at Auburn, you taking Auburn to two Final Fours, something I never thought would happen, but I do understand.\n\n'If he wants to run, I'm gonna support him 100 percent.'\n\nBarkley also voiced his support for Pearl as a coach by mentioning Auburn's graduation rate. \n\n'One thing I know about Bruce, he cares about his players,' Barkley said. 'He's graduated 100 percent of the players who stayed in school for four years, and he's proud of that. \n\n'That was the first conversation we had when he first got the job. I said, \"Hey, man, I want Auburn to be great in basketball. I really do. But my number one priority is these young black kids getting their education. You're gonna have a couple guys who go pro, but most of these guys are gonna have to go out and be grown men. So, I know he cares about people and players.\"'\n\nPearl has not indicated any specific plans to run for Senate, but did establish himself as a staunch conservative for praising Trump's decision to bomb Iran. The 65-year-old Massachusetts native even went so far as to nominate Trump for the Nobel Peace Prize because of that military action in Iran.\n\nAlthough he is a former Republican, himself, Barkley does not support Trump. However, as he told AL.com, that doesn't disqualify Pearl from receiving his support. \n\n'I'm not a Trump guy, but it's not up to me to tell people they can't vote for Trump,' Barkley said. 'I don't know who voted for Trump in my circle, but I'm pretty sure some of them did. I publicly supported Kamala [Harris] and had her husband on my podcast, and so I'm a Kamala guy, but I'm not stupid enough to think some of my rich friends didn't vote for Trump. I'm not that stupid.' \n\nThe US Senate seat in question is currently occupied by another former Auburn coach, Tommy Tuberville, who led the Tigers' football team to an 85-40 record in his decade at the school.\n\nA staunch Trump supporter who quit coaching after a 4-8 season with Cincinnati in 2016, Tuberville announced his intention in May to run for Governor of Alabama.\n\nHe does face a number of obstacles, including claims he actually lives in Florida as opposed to Alabama as well as questions about the Tommy Tuberville Foundation, which shuttered in 2021. A Tuberville spokesman told the Washington Post in 2023 that the foundation paused activities during a government audit, but that the former Tigers coach planned on reforming the organization.\n\nFor his part, Tuberville claims he splits his time between Alabama and Washington.","summary":"Auburn alum and former Republican Charles Barkley was asked about a potential senate run by Auburn basketball coach Bruce Pearl, who is coming off his second Final Fourth berth.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/college-basketball/article-14897485/Charles-Barkley-Trump-Auburn-Bruce-Pearl.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/07/11/16/100228003-0-image-m-12_1752247384575.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 15:23:20","author":"Alex Raskin,Editor","authors":["Alex Raskin","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":340662428,"title":"Roseanne Barr Addresses ABC Firing After Racist Tweet","text":"Actress and comedian Roseanne Barr spoke out this week about her 2018 firing from ABC over a racist tweet she made about Valerie Jarrett, a former senior adviser to former President Barack Obama.Newsweek has reached out to Barr's representative via email for comment on Friday.The ContextBarr, 72, rose to fame on her hit ABC sitcom Roseanne, which premiered in 1988.

Voters will select a candidate to occupy a vacant city council seat, which opened up after Councilmember Trayon White was removed in February due to his 2024 arrest related to a federal corruption investigation. Notably, White is among those vying to return to his previous position on the council.\n\nThis election offers the district’s 8th Ward residents the chance to regain council representation as the city contends with a $1 billion budget gap, a result of the Trump administration’s considerable cuts to the federal workforce. Additionally, the city faces a separate billion-dollar budget dispute with congressional Republicans and a potential conflict between the city’s Democratic mayor and the council over a proposed $4 billion stadium deal with the Washington Commanders football team.\n\nApart from White, the candidates in the race include Salim Adofo, Mike Austin, and Sheila Bunn. Adofo currently chairs a local Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC), while Austin, an attorney, is a former ANC chair. Bunn has previously served as a top aide to former mayor and longstanding Councilmember Vincent Gray, and to the district’s congressional non-voting delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton. All four candidates are Democrats, with no Republicans featured on the ballot.\n\nDespite his ongoing legal troubles, White was reelected in 2024 with 76% of the vote over his Republican opponent. Adofo challenged White in the primary that year but placed second with 28% of the vote, behind White’s 51%. Austin challenged White in the 2020 primary, but White prevailed with 58% to Austin’s 28%.\n\nWard 8, like the city itself, is heavily Democratic. Former Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris carried the ward with 91% of the vote in the 2024 presidential race against Republican Donald Trump.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap.

Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won wealthier voters who make $100,000 and above by 51-47%, but lost those earning less than that by the exact same margin [...]\n\n[President Donald] Trump won those who said that inflation had caused them “severe hardship” by a whopping 76-23% margin. He also won those suffering “moderate hardship” 52-46%. Being the party of the elite, Harris won those suffering “no hardship” 78-21%. As former Daily Kos writer Kerry Eleveld once said during a podcast, “Democrats are the party of people who don’t have to look at grocery prices while shopping.”\n\nTrump tapped into that anxiety by promising to lower prices “on Day One”—a ridiculous pledge that he still hasn’t met despite being however many hellish days into this presidency. But by simply acknowledging the economic pain people felt, he didn’t just win lower-income voters; he also made major inroads with Latinos and Asians. \n\nZohran Mamdani, the Democratic candidate for mayor of New York City, is taking the same approach, promising free child care, free buses, a rent freeze, and low-cost city-run grocery stores, plus a lot else. It’s easy to promise big things when you’re not yet in charge, but the first job of a politician is to get elected. And step one is understanding what people actually care about.\n\nI’m skeptical of Mamdani’s ability to deliver on his entire platform, but he’s doing the most important thing: explicitly telling voters, I hear you. I’m going to try like hell to make your life easier. Even if he pulls off only part of that, voters will reward the effort. And his relentless focus on pocketbook issues gives confidence that he gets it.\n\nTake this viral clip from January, back when he was stuck in the single digits in the polls. He interviewed halal food vendors and revealed that, thanks to city hall’s broken permitting system, entrepreneurs have to pay tens of thousands to so-called fixers for a permit that technically costs around $400, according to one of the vendors. That’s legalized corruption, driving up food prices. \n\n“New York is suffering from a crisis, and it’s called halalflation,” Mamdani said in the video. In a post accompanying the video, he hit the message perfectly: “Chicken over rice now costs $10 or more. It’s time to make halal eight bucks again.”\n\nThat line is genius, painting a picture of a Democratic city drowning in dysfunction. It’s not just about the $2 or $3 extra it’s costing New Yorkers for what should be cheaper eats. If we can’t make government work in a city where we run everything, why should voters trust us anywhere else?\n\nA newer ad from Mamdani on this theme is just as strong:\n\nIn this one, he promises to make it “faster, easier, and cheaper” to start and operate a small business. Why should an aspiring barber have to, in Mamdani’s words, “fill out 24 forms and go through seven agencies to start a barbershop”?\n\nI tested NYC’s business portal myself. To start a barbershop, I got a list of 31 requirements spread across more than a dozen agencies. I didn’t dig into all the forms (I’m not moving to Queens to cut hair), but his numbers check out—and might even be conservative.\n\nTo be clear, not all red tape is bad. Some regulations exist for good reason—like making sure that chemicals used in barbershops don’t poison the air or water, or that buildings meet fire codes. \n\nBut when the process becomes so bloated that entrepreneurs have to pay $22,000 to fixers for a $400 permit, that’s not public safety—it’s legalized extortion. When it takes a year to get a sign approved, you’re not ensuring quality; you’re suffocating small business. \n\nThat’s the larger truth: Even well-intentioned regulations can pile up into an expensive, time-consuming, job-killing mess. Local governments should be doing everything they can to make starting a small business easier, not treating it like a hazing ritual.\n\nDemocrats can’t cede the language of struggle and survival to Republicans. We need more candidates who don’t just talk policy but can also translate it into plain language and real relief, communicating clearly to voters that they’ll fight to lower the damn price of lunch. And rent. And child care. And education … you get the picture.","summary":"Regular readers know I’ve been harping on this theme: To win, Democrats need to promise—and deliver!—clear, immediate, and simple solutions to the cost-of-living challenges facing voters.

Pre-Trump, the FCC didn’t give much thought to what constituted public interest, but Carr has, I am told.\n\nIn his world view, the First Amendment gives CBS or any local affiliate freedom to publish what it wants. What the First Amendment doesn’t confer is FCC approval for local broadcast licenses, and one interpretation of public interest is that news content must not contain political bias. \n\nPundits can bounce around opinions all they want, but when news shows tilt the scales during debates when a national election is on the line, as alleged in the “60 Minutes” interview with a presidential candidate, the FCC can deny local broadcast licensing and upend mergers like Paramount’s sale to Skydance.\n\nConservatives have been harping for years about TV bias, the open flouting of the FCC rules, but Carr is the first to take it seriously. He intends to make CBS his test case as the Skydance-Paramount deal seeks his agency’s blessing.\n\nIn an interesting twist, Trump’s lawsuit against CBS for allegedly editing the Harris interview to make her sound smarter and more presidential, is nearly identical to a complaint filed by a conservative legal group, Center For American Rights with the FCC that sparked the FCC investigation of CBS and placed another roadblock to the deal.\n\nHere’s what people close to the FCC tell me. Trump won some concessions out of CBS, the money, the PSAs and now going forward, CBS must release full transcripts of interviews so the public can see if it’s deceptively editing news interviews. \n\nCarr will demand a bit more, I am told. Maybe an ombudsman to monitor news content. The Center For American Rights has spoken with the FCC and given some remedies including moving some of CBS’s operations out from the progressive ecosystem of New York, DC and Los Angeles.\n\nCarr also has said he wants to preserve local news, where affiliate stations have been complaining that they are getting squeezed by CBS with ever higher fees to run content. CBS might be forced to cut the affiliates a break. \n\nThe decision on just what to agree to will largely be up to Ellison, the independent movie producer of such hits as “Top Gun: Maverick,” since he will be the new owner once the deal is approved. And make no mistake, this is getting approved one way or another. \n\nDavid is the son of mega billionaire Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, and a Trump MAGA supporter.\n\nTrump, Carr’s boss, wants the deal to proceed, but he also wants to twist the knife into CBS just a bit more for years of alleged biased coverage of him and his agenda. So, expect the deal to get approved with a few conditions that Ellison is likely to agree with whether or not it angers the progressive purists that haven’t already left in the CBS news division.\n\nThe timing of all this is a little uncertain. The deal has a drop-dead date of October, and it has just been given a final 90-day extension to work out the details. The FCC will be discussing remedies this week on the center’s complaint, I am told.\n\nMeanwhile, Ellison, from what I hear, misses the objective, hard-hitting news that was CBS’s legacy dating back to the great Edward R Murrow. Anything that de-politicizes the newsroom he can live with, sources tell On The Money.\n\nA spokeswoman for Ellison declined comment on potential FCC remedies, as did a rep for the FCC.","summary":"Trump, Brendan Carr's boss, wants the deal to proceed, but he also wants to twist the knife into CBS just a bit more.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/11/media/why-fcc-chair-will-continue-to-throttle-paramount-skydance-merger-despite-trump-settlement/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/Brendan-Carr-No-deal.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 13:18:25","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.034},{"id":340624870,"title":"The 1600: Reflections on the Near Assassination of Donald Trump","text":"Opinion | Tap here to get this newsletter delivered to your inbox.Good morning,&#127926;Friday Listening: Johnny Cash - God's Gonna Cut You DownI've been in meetings this week planning our coverage for the anniversary of Trump's near-assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania on Sunday. Can you believe that was only a year ago? What a wild period in American history that was: the CNN debate, Trump gets shot, Biden drops out, Kamala swaps in... all in the span of, like, a month.It's worth taking a beat to remember what happened on that fairground in western Pennsylvania, because there are still so many unanswered—maybe unanswerable—questions about a moment that came within a quarter-inch of changing the course of history. In fact, it probably did change the course of history in terms of being the moment that solidified Donald Trump's political comeback. Would he have won had he not been shot? Perhaps, but his victory was a foregone conclusion in my mind as soon as he put his fist in the air, as captured in that iconic photo by the AP's Evan Vucci (one of the greatest pieces of photojournalism of my lifetime. Still in awe when I look at it).Because even if you loathe Trump, as so many do, you must admit that his handling of that moment in Butler... jumping up from a pile of Secret Service agents, blood smeared on his face, fist raised, \"Fight!\".... was both politically brilliant and incredibly, badass cool.And yet, despite the fact that we came so close to watching the former and future American president murdered on live television, it doesn't feel like Butler was this momentous event, does it? Part of that, I think, is just how the news cycle plays these days. Part of it is an anti-Trump bias in the media, probably. Part of it is how little we still know about the motives of the kid who almost became the Gavrilo Princip of the 21st century. But it's notable how the near assassination of the Republican candidate for president did not really lead to a moment of national unity or reflection that, I think, so many of us were hoping for.I remember watching the RNC the following week, when Trump came out on the last night to deliver his convention speech. I remember thinking about how he looked different: older, more vulnerable than we were used to seeing him with that big bandage on his injured ear. He started his speech in this really reflective tone—very unusual for him—talking about how painful it was to discuss what had happened the prior Saturday and how \"you'll never hear it from me a second time, because it's actually too painful to tell.\" It was an absolutely gripping moment. I thought, fleetingly, that not only was he going to win regardless of who the Dems were about to swap in for Joe, but that maybe he really was saved by some kind of divine intervention, and that we were about to see a new side of Donald Trump.It didn't really work out that way. By the halfway point of the RNC speech he was back to his laundry list of grievances interspersed with random asides about Kid Rock and his poll numbers. Trump did go on to win decisively, helped along by Kamala Harris being an awful opponent, but he hasn't really even tried to capitalize on that moment of national relief after Butler by trying to unify the country during his second term. It's a shame, really. It feels like a lost opportunity.As for the shooter, quick... can you remember his name off the top of your head? I didn't think so. Thomas Crooks, the 20-year-old weirdo who somehow managed to crawl onto that roof and get a clean line of sight to the biggest target in the world, left virtually no trace. No social media footprint, no friends, no apparent motive. A registered Republican who donated to the Democrats and had no obvious beef with Trump? What? It's no wonder there have been so many conspiracy theories about what him. I think as humans, we have a very hard time comprehending when trivial people are able to have such an outsized impact on history. Oswald, Sirhan Sirhan, Chapman, Ray, the dude who almost killed Reagan to make Jodie Foster fall in love with him (didn't work). These guys were all stone cold losers who just got lucky, or almost lucky.Thankfully for the country, Crooks' joins their company in the \"almost lucky\" column.Trump Finds Retreating From World Stage Is Easier Said Than DoneWhen Donald Trump campaigned for the presidency in 2016, 2020 and 2024, he made one overarching promise to voters: no more costly overseas entanglements.In a video rolling out his foreign policy agenda during the 2024 campaign, Trump called himself \"the only president who rejected the catastrophic advice of many of Washington's generals, bureaucrats, and the so-called diplomats who only know how to get us into conflict, but they don't know how to get us out.\"Now, approaching six months into his second term, Trump has publicly toyed with the idea of annexing Canada and invading Greenland; ordered a series of missile strikes on Iran; and mused about the possibility of regime change in Tehran (he later backed off that threat), while also engaging in an on-again, off-again trade war with much of the world.

Former Vice President Kamala Harris saw Democrats unenthusiastic in 2024, as she won the state by about 6 points, the lowest support for a Democrat in the state since the 1996 election.\n\nThe New Jersey gubernatorial race is expected to be highly competitive, and Sherrill will likely need to boost voter enthusiasm, helped by Obama’s support, to beat Republican nominee Jack Ciattarelli. Ciattarelli came within about 3 points of beating Murphy in the 2021 election, the closest a Republican has come to the top office in the state since former Gov. Chris Christie won in 2013.\n\nNew Jersey is much more competitive for Republicans in its gubernatorial races, electing centrist Republicans like Christine Todd Whitman and Christie for two terms each from 1994 to 2001 and 2010 to 2018, respectively.\n\nObama remains well liked.

Raúl Grijalva, who died in March from complications from cancer treatment.\n\nThe winners will represent their parties in a Sept. 23 special election to serve out the remaining 15 months of Grijalva’s term in the 7th Congressional District, which stretches from Yuma to Tuscon and hugs almost the entire length of Arizona’s border with Mexico.\n\nThe seat will not decide control of the U.S. House, but it is one of three vacancies in heavily Democratic districts that, when filled in special elections this fall, will likely chip away at Republicans’ slender 220-212 majority in the chamber.\n\nFive candidates are running for the Democratic nomination. Former Pima County Supervisor Adelita Grijalva is the daughter of the late congressman and has the support of many of the state’s most prominent Democrats, including U.S. Sens. Mark Kelly and Ruben Gallego, state Attorney General Kris Mayes and former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords. She also has endorsements from U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, key figures in the party’s progressive wing. Sanders is an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nFormer state Rep. Daniel Hernandez previously ran in the neighboring 6th Congressional District in 2022 but fell short of the nomination. As a congressional intern in January 2011, he provided care to Giffords after a near-fatal assassination attempt outside a Tucson grocery store.\n\nSocial media influencer and progressive activist Deja Foxx is the youngest in the field at age 25. As a 16-year-old, Foxx gained prominence when an interaction she had with Republican then-U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake on reproductive rights at a 2017 town hall went viral. She went on to work as a digital strategist for Kamala Harris’ presidential primary campaign in 2020. She told Rolling Stone in 2021 that she plans to be president.\n\nIndigenous activist and scholar Jose Malvido Jr. and former health care executive Patrick Harris Sr. also seek the Democratic nomination.\n\nThe Republican primary ballot features contractor and small business owner Daniel Butierez, restaurant owner Jorge Rivas and general contractor and vehicle accessory business owner Jimmy Rodriguez. All three have previously sought elected office.\n\nButierez received about 37% of the vote as the Republican nominee against Raúl Grijalva in 2024, while then-presidential candidate Donald Trump retook Arizona at the top of the ballot. Rivas mounted a short-lived campaign for governor in 2022 following a 2020 flap when his and his wife’s attendance at a Trump campaign rally triggered negative reviews of his restaurant. Rodriguez ran for Congress in 2020, initially filing to run in Arizona’s 8th Congressional District as a GOP primary challenger to then-U.S. Rep. Debbie Lesko but ultimately withdrawing and running instead in Vermont, where he lost the Republican nomination to face Democratic U.S. Rep. Peter Welch.\n\nHernandez led the field in fundraising as of late June, with $981,000 in total contributions compared with $834,000 for Grijalva and $600,000 for Foxx. But Hernandez’s high spending rate left Adelita Grijalva with the most money in the bank heading into the campaign’s final stretch. She had about $128,000 as of June 25, compared with $100,000 for Foxx and about $37,000 for Hernandez.\n\nButierez had brought in nearly $180,000 for his campaign, most of it in loans secured by the candidate. His $98,000 in the bank far eclipsed the rest of the GOP field.\n\nThe majority-Hispanic 7th District includes parts of six counties, including the three most populous: Maricopa, Pima and Pinal. While Maricopa often plays a pivotal role in statewide elections, it takes a backseat in the 7th District to Pima County, which comprises more than 60% of the district’s registered voters.\n\nDemocrats enjoy a nearly 2-1 ratio registration advantage over Republicans, both districtwide as well as in five of the six counties. Republicans outnumber Democrats in the small corner of Pinal County that falls within district boundaries.\n\nAfter Pima County, Maricopa and Yuma counties offer the highest potential for possible votes in both Democratic and Republican primaries, followed by Santa Cruz.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap. If a race has not been called, the AP will continue to cover any newsworthy developments, such as candidate concessions or declarations of victory. In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nIn Arizona, recounts are automatic if the vote margin is 0.5% of the total vote or less. The AP may declare a winner in a race that’s eligible for a recount if it can determine the lead is too large for a recount or legal challenge to change the outcome.\n\nHere’s a look at what to expect Tuesday:\n\nSpecial primary day\n\nThe special primaries for Arizona’s 7th Congressional District will be held Tuesday. Polls close districtwide at 7 p.m. local time, which is 10 p.m. ET. No results will be released before 11 p.m. ET. Most of Arizona does not observe Daylight Saving Time.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot?\n\nThe AP will provide vote results and declare winners in both the Democratic and Republican primaries.\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nThe special primaries are limited to voters who are registered in the 7th Congressional District. Registered Democrats and Republicans may vote only in their own parties’ primaries. Independents may vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nAs of June 16, there were nearly 440,000 voters registered in the 7th District. Of those, about 175,000, or 40%, were Democrats, and nearly 92,000, or 21%, were Republicans. Roughly 165,000 voters were not registered with any party.\n\nIn the 2024 primaries for the 7th District, turnout was 12% of registered voters in the Democratic primary and 5% in the Republican primary.

On Wednesday, Washington Post publisher and CEO Will Lewis offered a blunt ultimatum to staff who aren't onboard with the \"new direction\" the paper is taking under its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos. \"I understand and respect, however, that our chosen path is not for everyone,\" Lewis wrote in a memo obtained by Fox News Digital. \"That’s exactly why we introduced the voluntary separation program. As we continue in this new direction, I want to ask those who do not feel aligned with the company’s plan to reflect on that. The VSP is designed to support you in making this decision, give you the ability to weigh your options thoughtfully and with less concern about financial consequences. And if you think that it’s time to move on to a new chapter, the VSP helps you take that next step with more security.\" WASHINGTON POST CEO URGES STAFFERS WHO DON'T ‘FEEL ALIGNED’ WITH PAPER'S NEW DIRECTION TO TAKE BUYOUT The buyout program, first announced in May by Post executive editor Matt Murray, specifically targeted veteran staffers and other departments. The program is set to conclude by the end of July. The staffer suspects, however, that Lewis' mid-July message means \"people aren't interested\" in taking the buyout despite the turmoil and agony that has erupted in recent months. \"It’s been one set of blows after another. So this memo is par for the course,\" the insider says. \"Another bomb went off but who notices anymore?\" LONGTIME WASHINGTON POST COLUMNIST QUITS PAPER, SLAMS GROWING EDITORIAL CONSTRAINTS UNDER BEZOS One staffer who wasn't onboard with the \"new direction\" of the Post was longtime columnist Joe Davidson, who shed light on what led to his resignation from the paper late last month. It is unclear whether he took a voluntary buyout. \"For me, the cost became too great when a Federal Insider column I wrote was killed because it was deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy, which I had not heard of previously,\" the 20-year Post veteran wrote Tuesday on his Facebook page. \"While the policy prohibiting opinion and commentary in News section articles can be justified journalistically, it is a departure from longstanding Post practice and mandated a change in my role that I chose not to accept.\" While Davidson didn't believe Bezos was directly involved in his column being killed, he wrote, \"it would be naïve to ignore the context.\" \"Starting before the November presidential election, Bezos’s policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant,\" Davidson said. \"The result – fleeing journalists, plummeting morale and disappearing subscriptions. Since October, when Bezos blocked publication of a planned Post endorsement of Kamala Harris for president, the departure of Post talent has been shocking and included five former editors directly above me in the newsroom’s hierarchy.\" \"Nonetheless, Post coverage of Trump remains strong. Yet the policy against opinion in News section columns means less critical scrutiny of Trump -- a result coinciding with Bezos’s unseemly and well-document[ed] coziness with the president,\" Davidson continued. He later wrote, \"As a columnist, I can’t live with that level of constraint. A column without commentary made me a columnist without a column… When Bezos bought The Post, he provided needed money, energy and direction. The Post continues to produce first-rate journalism now, despite his morale-busting actions.\" JEFF BEZOS' TENURE AS WASHINGTON POST OWNER IN SPOTLIGHT AS PAPER GRAPPLES WITH LOW MORALE, STAFFER EXODUS CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Post has suffered a dramatic decline in subscriptions, which was further fueled by multiple boycott campaigns against the \"Democracy Dies in Darkness\" paper over decisions made by Bezos. In October, Bezos set off an uproar when he halted the paper's endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election. Then in February 2025, Bezos announced his directive for the Post's editorial pages to promote \"personal liberties and free markets\" and vowed not to publish pieces opposing those principles. Both instances sparked a mass exodus of paid subscribers and several resignations, including opinion editor David Shipley, who opposed Bezos' new policy. Last month, the Post tapped Adam O'Neal, formerly of The Economist and The Wall Street Journal, to lead the opinion pages. The paper has lost a flood of reporters to rival publications in recent months, such as Josh Dawsey, Ashey Parker, Michael Schere and Tyler Pager, in addition to columnists who have quit, like Jennifer Rubin, Eugene Robinson and Ruth Marcus. A spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment to Fox News Digital.","summary":"The latest effort by The Washington Post to reduce headcount is hitting a wall according to one insider at the paper, as low morale continues to plague the newsroom.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/washington-post-staff-shellshocked-constant-blows-morale-bosses-seek-buyouts-insider-says","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/931/523/WaPojpg.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-11 12:00:22","author":"Joseph Wulfsohn","authors":["Joseph Wulfsohn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.02},{"id":340582030,"title":"Why Zohran Mamdani matters outside New York City","text":"There are several reasons that the election will reverberate beyond the five boroughs.\n\nNew York City isn’t Las Vegas\n\nThe old saying is that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Not true in New York City, which is the country’s largest. Of NYC, it is said that if you make it there, you make it anywhere. \n\nNew York is second only to Washington, D.C., as the home of the national political press. It is arguably the most important city for the Democratic Party in 2025.\n\nPolitical trends in the city that doesn’t sleep will necessarily receive outsize attention. If Mamdani wins, he will become a model for socialists throughout the country on how to obtain and wield political power. He will also quickly become the top Republican bogeyman.\n\nDemocrats are looking for direction\n\nThe Democratic Party has been trying to find itself since President Donald Trump returned to the White House. Democrats have been having a national conversation about Mamdani’s candidacy, with Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA) and former Rep. Dean Phillips speaking out against it and several other, more liberal Democrats being slow to endorse him.\n\nWhen CNN asked Phillips whether the Democratic Party was big enough for both him and Mamdani, the former Minnesota congressman replied, “The answer, ultimately, I think is no.” Asked a similar question by PBS about Mamdani’s refusal to condemn the phrase “globalize the intifada,” Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, by contrast, said the party was a big tent.\n\nA Mamdani loss, or a disastrous four years in Gracie Mansion, could empower centrists and other Democrats who want the party to attempt to recapture the voters it lost to Trump. But a Mamdani victory will embolden everyone who would like to see the Democrats move to the left at a time of palpable progressive anger that occasionally (but increasingly frequently) bleeds into violence. \n\nMost Democrats, and virtually all of the party establishment, feared nominating Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) for president in 2016 and 2020. They might be willing to nominate a younger version in 2028. It will at least influence how far Democrats may be willing to go on socialism, Resistance, Israel, and overthrowing their aging establishment, especially if a socialist can position himself as the candidate of affordability, as former Vice President Kamala Harris conspicuously failed to do last year. \n\nA Mamdani win could also directly influence the fortunes of top national Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), and rising Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY). \n\nFor a while, it looked like Democrats were going to handle urban progressive misgovernment themselves through the primary process. That hasn’t happened lately, with bad mayors chasing worse in Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, and now possibly New York City.\n\nAt least Mamdani is constitutionally ineligible to run for president. While the recent track record for New York City mayors seeking the White House hasn’t been good, Michael Bloomberg was hampered by his late entry and Rudy Giuliani by bad strategy. Both could have made it further if they had campaigned differently. \n\nSocialism on Wall Street\n\nA New York City mayor can muse about seizing the means of production, but most of what he would want to do would be outside the jurisdiction of local elected officials. But the city houses much of the U.S. financial sector. There could easily be an exodus of investors from the city. While that would mostly be felt locally, subjecting Wall Street to socialist leadership would have at least some national effect, even if only to demonstrate the powerlessness of wealthy New Yorkers to forestall this outcome. Though it is worth noting that some of Mamdani’s supporters are surprisingly well off.\n\nNew York is not simply a minor city whose elections have no consequences for the rest of the country.\n\nThat’s why the country is watching to see what happens with Mamdani in November.","summary":"Everybody is talking about Zohran Mamdani, the state legislator and New York City Democratic mayoral nominee who has become a national news story.

Johnson in 1954 when he was serving as the U.S. Senate majority leader. It banned all tax-exempt organizations like churches and charities from “directly or indirectly” participating in politics, specifically in endorsement or opposition of candidates. \n\nWho was behind the lawsuit? \n\nThe July 7 filing stems from a lawsuit filed in Texas in September 2024 on behalf of the National Religious Broadcasters, an international association of evangelical Christian communicators, as well as Intercessors for America, a conservative Christian prayer advocacy group. Two Texas churches also joined as plaintiffs: First Baptist Church Waskom in Waskom, Texas, and Sand Springs Church in Athens, Texas. \n\nWhy are some people concerned? \n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation, whose membership is comprised of nearly 40,000 \"atheists, agnostics and skeptics of any pedigree,\" was “stunned” by the reversal of the decades-long policy, foundation legal counsel Chris Line told USA TODAY. \n\nThe foundation has reported dozens of pastors and churches to the IRS over the years for engaging in what it viewed as prohibited political speech, Line said. \n\nIt reported the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association in September 2024, for example, over its election guide that it said had a “clear bias and preference for Donald Trump and Republicans.” \n\nIt also reported New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Georgia after former Vice President Kamala Harris was invited to speak at a worship service in October 2024. Pastor Jamal Bryant made comments that suggested the church was “urging its congregants to vote for Kamala Harris in the upcoming election in violation of the law,” the foundation’s letter to the IRS said. \n\nHe referenced the narrow nature of the IRS’ July statement and said it appears that “a lot of the worst actions would still be impermissible” under the tax code. There is, however, room for questions about where the line between prohibited and acceptable political involvement will fall in practice. \n\n“Churches shouldn’t necessarily feel 100% safe based on this to go out and start violating the Johnson Amendment,” he said. \n\nDan Mach, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Program on Freedom of Religion and Belief, also told USA TODAY the exemption “raises serious constitutional concerns” by “favoring religious viewpoints over nonreligious ones when handing out tax subsidies and benefits.” \n\nLine also expressed concern over the \"disparity\" between tax rules for religious organizations and other charitable entitites.\n\n\"We're in a situation now where churches are allowed to violate this law, but all other groups, including the Freedom From Religion Foundation, were not given that same carve out,\" he said.\n\nThe American Humanist Association said it was “discouraged, but ultimately not surprised” by the decision in a July 8 statement. \n\n“The Johnson Amendment, though weakened over the years by lax enforcement, is the small but mighty dam standing in the way of a torrent of dark money influencing our elections,” executive director Fish Stark said. \n\nNow, “all bets are off.” \n\n“There will be little to stop billionaires from funneling money through churches to buy our elections – and they will get a tax write-off for doing it, all subsidized by American taxpayers,” Stark said. \n\nIt said the ruling is ultimately a boost for the religious right and Christian nationalists, whom they said now “have the megaphone they’ve been waiting for for decades.” \n\nWho's celebrating the decision?\n\nTrump called it a \"terrific\" move by the IRS.\n\n\"I love the fact that churches could endorse a political candidate,\" Trump told reporters at the White House, according to Reuters. \"If somebody of faith wants to endorse, I think it's something that I'd like to hear.\"\n\nRobert Jeffress, senior pastor of First Baptist Church in Dallas, said the change \"would never have happened without the strong leadership of our great President Donald Trump\" in a July 9 X post.\n\n\"Government has NO BUSINESS regulating what is said in pulpits!\" he wrote.\n\nThe Freedom From Religion Foundation also reported Jeffress to the IRS for his overt support of Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020.\n\nWhat previous actions have been taken to remove the Johnson Amendment? \n\nTrump pledged in his first term to “totally destroy” the Johnson Amendment and later claimed to have “gotten rid of” the provision, but the law has remained part of the tax code. Trump did, however, direct the Treasury Department to avoid penalizing religious organizations for speech about “moral or political issues from a religious perspective” in a May 2017 executive order. \n\nRep. Mark Harris, R-NC, and Sen. James Lankford, R-OK, introduced the Free Speech Fairness Act in March that sought to allow charitable organizations – which would include churches and other houses of worship − to make political statements “if such statements are made in the ordinary course of carrying out its tax-exempt purpose.” \n\nU.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, co-sponsored Lankford’s bill, while more than a dozen Republican representatives including Rep. Barry Moore, R-Alabama, and Abe Hamadeh, R-Arizona, co-sponsored the House bill. \n\n“For too long, the Johnson Amendment has silenced pastors, churches and non-profits from engaging on moral and political issues of our day for fear of losing their tax-exempt status,” Harris said in a March news release. “This attempt to muzzle people of faith must end – the Constitution is clear: Americans’ right to free speech shall not be infringed.” \n\nIs this a popular idea? \n\nAccording to a 2024 survey conducted by Lifeway research, a Southern Baptist Convention research organization, only three in 10 U.S. adults (29%) believe pastors publicly endorsing candidates for public office during a church service is appropriate. Three in five (60%) disagree, including 42% who strongly disagree and 11% who aren’t sure. \n\nWhen asked directly in the survey if churches that endorse political candidates should lose their tax-exempt status, around 48% of respondents agreed, 31% disagreed and 21% weren’t sure. \n\nBut the percentage of Americans who see pastors endorsing a candidate in church as appropriate has risen steadily over the past 16 years, according to the organization. In the first survey of the topic in 2008, only 13% saw political endorsements during a church service as acceptable. The number rose steadily in the second survey conducted in 2015, before rising to its current 29% in 2024. \n\nHas the Johnson Amendment been challenged before? \n\nPrevious court rulings have upheld the Johnson Amendment over the years. \n\nThe 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in the 1970s that a nonprofit religious organization was not entitled to a tax exemption because its actions, according to the court, sought to influence legislation and “attack(ed) candidates and incumbents who were considered too liberal.” \n\nThe ruling said the government has an “overwhelming and compelling” interest in keeping the “wall separating church and state ... high and firm.” \n\nDecades later, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled that a religious organization that had its tax-exempt status revoked had “failed to establish a First Amendment violation” in the case. \n\nNotably, speakers at the inaugural meeting of Trump’s Religious Liberty Commission in June also supported challenges to the Johnson Amendment and expressed a belief that the First Amendment doesn’t prevent the government from promoting religion as a social good. \n\nBrieAnna Frank is a First Amendment Reporting Fellow at USA TODAY.

But six months in, 'I'm very impressed.'","text":"Roger Hutson was never a huge fan of Donald Trump. In 2016, he supported Marco Rubio for president, helping raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for his Republican primary bid. In 2024, Hutson worked with \"No Labels,\" a group of Democrats, Republicans and independents, to forge a bipartisan ticket with the express purpose of keeping either Trump or Joe Biden from winning the White House. Is this \"really the best we can do in a country of 330 million people?\" Hutson asked in a Denver Post opinion piece after the effort collapsed and another Trump-Biden matchup seemed inevitable. The failure, he suggested, was \"a sad commentary on the status of leadership in America.\" But something unexpected happened over the last six months. Trump won Hutson over. He's not gone full-fledged MAGA. \"No, no, no!\" he insisted, scoffing at the notion of driving down the street, Trump flag waving. And he's not about to jump on JD Vance's political bandwagon, the likeliest vehicle for extending Trumpism in 2028 and beyond. \"I'm acknowledging the accomplishments of the man in the office,\" Hutson said, with emphasis on the White House's current occupant, whom he supported over Kamala Harris. \"I'm very impressed.\" It's not, as one might suppose, because the Denver oil and gas executive is enamored of Trump's exhortations to \"Drill, baby, drill! (\"No, baby, no!\" is more like it, as Hutson believes oversupply would drive prices down.) Rather, Hutson credits Trump with achieving a good deal of what he promised during the 2024 campaign. Securing America's borders. Forcing U.S. allies to cough up more for defense. Bringing Iran's nuclear program to heel. Taking on the country's unfair trade partners. He still doesn't much care for Trump's abrasive personality, the name-calling and denigrating of people. But Hutson's conversion shows that in a country deeply dug into oppositional camps, where political views appear cement-hardened into place, there are still those open to persuasion and even willing to change their minds. As confounding as that might seem. :: Hutson, 65, was a Republican his whole life, until leaving the party sometime in the 2010s. Or, more precisely, he felt \"the party left me.\" A growing stridency around abortion and same-sex marriage was particularly off-putting to Hutson, who describes himself as a conservative on fiscal issues and a live-and-let-live type on social matters. \"If you're lucky enough in life to find somebody you love,\" he said, \"God bless.\" Hutson has long been active in civic and political affairs, serving on various boards and commissions under Democrats and Republicans alike. He recalled attending a meeting some years ago when GOP leaders gathered to discuss Colorado's increasingly blue coloration. \"If winning means nominating an African American lesbian with antennae coming out of her head,\" then Republicans should do so, Hutson suggested. That didn't go over well. But it fit Hutson's approach to politics. He grew up an Army brat, moving around the world until his father completed his military career and settled in Golden, Colo., to take a job at a family lumber business. For all the impermanence — packing up and relocating just about every two years — Hutson said his upbringing was in many ways ideal, shaping his outlook to this day. The military, he said, reflects the best of America: unity, shared purpose, teamwork. \"I think it teaches you a lot of tolerance,\" he said. \"I think it teaches you a lot of acceptance.\" His GOP pedigree came from his father, the Army colonel. But it wasn't the scorched-earth version of today's Republican Party, in which Democrats and their philosophy are regarded as the root of all evil. Long ago, as leader of the Jefferson County Republican Men's Club, Hutson invited Colorado's governor, Democrat Roy Romer, to speak. \"I was catching such hell from people. 'How dare you invite a Democrat to speak to this group?' \" Hutson remembered being chastised. \"And I said, 'Well, he's our governor, isn't he? I think it'd be an honor.' \" After some initial puzzlement from the governor's office — are you sure? — Romer came and spoke, holding just the kind of cross-party conversation that Hutson wishes occurred more often among politicians in worlds-apart Washington. \"I'd love for Trump to have a weekly meeting with [Democratic House leader] Hakeem Jeffries,\" Hutson said as he sat high above downtown Denver, his office decor — dark leather, rugged mountain landscape, a display of amber liquids — suggesting a Western cigar bar theme. \"I would love for Trump to sit down weekly with [Chuck] Schumer\" — the Democratic Senate leader — or bring Schumer and the GOP Senate leader, John Thune, together and say, \" 'How do we work our way through this?' \" Could you imagine that, Hutson asked, before answering his own question. Nope. Never gonna happen. :: Nothing, and no individual, is perfect. But Hutson looks to the bottom line, and he's willing to accept trade-offs. Trump is loud and uncouth. But he's respected on the world stage, Hutson said, in a way the shuffling Biden was not. Trump may be toying with tariffs — up, down, all around. But at least he's addressing the country's one-sided trade relationships in a way, Hutson said, no president has before. He may be off base calling for a drastic ramp-up of domestic oil production. But in general, Hutson said, Trump's welcoming message to business is, \"What can we do to be more helpful?\" It's unfortunate that innocents are being swept up in mass immigration raids. But maybe that wouldn't have happened, Hutson said, if local officials had been more cooperative and criminal elements weren't allowed to insinuate themselves so deeply into their communities in the first place. Besides, he said, haven't Democrats and Republicans both said a secure border and tougher enforcement is needed before comprehensively overhauling the nation's fouled-up immigration system? \"We need to bring in the workers we need,\" Hutson said. \"I mean, if somebody's coming here to work and be a meaningful part of society, God bless, man.\" Not perfect. But, all in all, a better and stronger presidential performance, Hutson suggested, than many with their blind hatred of Trump can see, or are willing to acknowledge. \"I've got to look at the results,\" Hutson said, \"and despite his caustic attitude and behavior, I think he's done a really, really good job.\" When Barack Obama was elected president, Hutson recalled, one of his Democratic friends, a Black man, said to him, \" 'Roger, you've got a Black president.' And I said, 'You know, Kevin, you're right. And he's my president, just like he's your president. \" 'We don't have to agree on everything but, by God, he's the president of the United States and we respect that office.' \" Hutson paused. His eyes narrowed, disapprovingly. \"We've lost that,\" he said.","summary":"Roger Hutson said he's no MAGA acolyte.

The meteoric rise of Zohran Mamdani, a fiery young Democratic Socialist who recently claimed a shocking New York mayoral primary win, points to a grim answer. It’s presumptuous to extrapolate too much from one state or local race. (Remember how Scott Brown’s special election win in Massachusetts was supposed to signal the end of liberalism? Exactly.) But underestimating moments like this is also dangerous because tectonic rumbles often precede a political earthquake. Even if Mamdani isn’t the solution — and he likely isn’t — his stunning victory suggests a sobering possibility: The very thing Democrats have been running from is precisely what voters are chasing. For a decade now, there have been basically two prevailing theories about how to beat Trump. The first is simple: Be whatever he isn’t. If Trump is vulgar, be decent. If Trump is chaotic, be stable. If Trump breaks things, fix them. This theory is comforting, but it also assumes that voters will respond to decency and logic. An assumption that, as it turns out, is dubious. The second theory, while cynical, may be more accurate: Fight fire with fire. If you can’t beat him, join him. Not on policy — that would be insane — but on vibe. If Trump is a spectacle, Democrats should find one of their own. Trump understood the importance of dominating the public’s attention from the start. Apparently, so does Mamdani. And so do a handful of other left-wing firebrands (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Bernie Sanders, et al.) who make the party’s establishment look like buttoned-up accountants. There are different ways to break through in the modern era. You can be young and hip. You can be weird and magnetic. You can master the art of long-form podcast appearances and creating viral social media videos. But above all, you must eschew the trite pablum of scripted politicians. In this regard, it’s difficult to divorce style from substance. It’s no coincidence that today’s most attention-grabbing pols tend to promote the most radical proposals that also happen to excite previously underserved portions of the electorate. “Build the wall.” “Lock her up.” “Defund the police.” “Medicare for all.” These slogans are all, to varying degrees, unworkable — and previously unthinkable. But they all sound unorthodox and decisive, which in the contemporary political ecosystem is more effective than being wise or correct. Case in point: Trump can shift an entire news cycle by suggesting we should invade Canada or Greenland. Could a mainstream Democrat, if he or she were charismatic and talented enough, cut through that noise? In theory, yes. But the problem with moderates is that they tend to be moderate. Even in how they talk and how they dress. It’s not just their policies that feel safe — it’s their entire aesthetic. And in the attention economy, that’s a real handicap. The center, to paraphrase Yeats, cannot meme. This is why Mamdani’s radical take on politics is so resonant. Like Trump before him, he proposes ideas that have been wildly outside the political mainstream, and he actually seems to believe what he’s saying. This last part is key. Younger voters, especially, don’t merely want revolutionary policy positions; they want existential authenticity. So what is his radical take on politics? Mamdani wants to freeze rents and make buses and childcare free. He doesn’t think billionaires should exist. He has floated the idea of government-run grocery stores. He’s openly anti-Zionist. He refuses to condemn the incendiary phrase “globalize the intifada.” He’s confrontational. He’s shocking. He’s newsworthy. He’s … a complete turnoff to middle-aged, conservative commentators like me — which is proof he’s succeeding! It might be horrible for America to have not one, but two extremist parties; but after years of trying to sell candidates who won’t scare the suburban normies (with Kamala Harris being an earnest yet flawed attempt at this), you could forgive Democrats for wondering if what they really need is a Trump of their own. Someone who is fiery, meme-ready and authentically combative (albeit in a younger and entirely different package than Trump). It’s way too soon to say if this will be their trajectory. But it’s worth noting that, outside of Mamdani’s victory, the only Democratic moments this year that have evoked any real excitement or virality came during AOC and Bernie rallies. Still, nothing is guaranteed. If Democrats decide to go this route (say, with an AOC candidacy in 2028), they risk alienating otherwise “gettable” swing voters and dragging down the entire ticket. Indeed, some of Trump’s most potent 2024 ads involved pointing out Harris’ previous dalliances with “woke” politics. And that was with a candidate going out of her way to appear moderate. What energizes the base can just as easily terrify the middle. And it could hand fresh ammunition to a suddenly rudderless Republican Party, which without Trump on the ballot in 2028 could be quite vulnerable to losing to a standard-issue “vanilla” Democrat. Nevertheless, there’s an increasing sense that Democrats have no choice but to crawl into the carnival tent Trump built and become louder, flashier and fringier than he was. Not just because trying to be the respectable (read “boring”) party of institutions failed, but because our modern media milieu all but demands it. Matt K.

He then expounded on his decision in a Tuesday Facebook post. He said the decision was based on a piece he’d written earlier for the paper that was spiked because it was “deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy.” The journalist cited he had not heard of the rule previously nor had it been enforced. Davidson, 75, joined the paper in 2005 and had been writing the column since 2008.\n\nWhile Davidson said he did not have reason to believe Washing Post owner and billionaire Jeff Bezos was directly involved in the axing of his article, he noted it would be “naïve to ignore the context.”\n\n“Starting before the November presidential election, Bezos’s policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant,” he said “The result – fleeing journalists, plummeting morale and disappearing subscriptions. Since October, when Bezos blocked publication of a planned Post endorsement of Kamala Harris for president, the departure of Post talent has been shocking and included five former editors directly above me in the newsroom’s hierarchy.”\n\nIndeed, many high-profile staffers have quit including former opinion editor David Shipley and longtime columnist Ruth Marcus. A number of the resignations came after Bezos brought in Will Lewis as CEO and made a February announcement saying the paper’s opinion section would be focused on “two pillars” moving forward, free markets and personal liberties. Davidson said that coverage of Trump stayed consistent but that the new policy restricted any scrutiny of the president. He also said he was blown away by just how strict the new editorial policy was compared to years past.\n\n“Blocking my column because it was too opinionated was a shock. I’ve authored many pieces over my 17 years writing the ‘Federal Diary’ (renamed the ‘Federal Insider’ in 2016), that were at least if not more opinionated as the now dead one,” he said. “In that piece, I argued that ‘one hallmark of President Donald Trump’s first three, turbulent months in office is his widespread, ominous attack on thought, belief and speech.’”\n\nThe writer described the experience as a “death blow” to his life as a columnist but said he tried to stay the course to see if he “could cope with the restrictions.” He gave several specific examples of the editorial chokeholds he faced including describing a potential pay raise for federal employees as “well-deserved” as crossing the policy line. \n\n“As a columnist, I can’t live with that level of constraint,” he concluded “A column without commentary made me a columnist without a column. I also was troubled by significant inconsistencies in the implementation of the policy.” Davidson said that while he will no longer work at the paper he will still be a subscriber because of the outstanding journalists still there.\n\nThe news of his resignation came the same week that Lewis encouraged staffers who do not “feel aligned” with the news company’s “reinvention” to resign. Spotlighting The Post’s so-called “voluntary separation program” that offers buyouts for exiting employees, Lewis said “I truly wish you the best of luck” to employees who are weighing whether or not the company’s direction is for them — and that “if you believe in our next chapter, I’m excited for the work ahead of us.”\n\nYou can read Davidson below:Quitting The Washington Post — or did it quit me?\n\nWashington Post Columnist.\n\nWhat a great title in the world of journalism.\n\nBut it’s not worth keeping at any cost.\n\nFor me, the cost became too great when a Federal Insider column I wrote was killed because it was deemed too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy, which I had not heard of previously. My resignation, after 20 years with The Post, took effect this month.\n\nWhile the policy prohibiting opinion and commentary in News section articles can be justified journalistically, it is a departure from longstanding Post practice and mandated a change in my role that I chose not to accept. Some readers who commented on my final column skewered Post owner Jeff Bezos. I have no reason to believe he was directly involved in my situation, but it would be naïve to ignore the context.\n\nStarting before the November presidential election, Bezos’s policies and activities have projected the image of a Donald Trump supplicant. The result – fleeing journalists, plummeting morale and disappearing subscriptions. Since October, when Bezos blocked publication of a planned Post endorsement of Kamala Harris for president, the departure of Post talent has been shocking and included five former editors directly above me in the newsroom’s hierarchy. Nonetheless, Post coverage of Trump remains strong. Yet the policy against opinion in News section columns means less critical scrutiny of Trump — a result coinciding with Bezos’s unseemly and well-document coziness with the president.\n\nBlocking my column because it was too opinionated was a shock. I’ve authored many pieces over my 17 years writing the Federal Diary (renamed the Federal Insider in 2016), that were at least if not more opinionated as the now dead one. In that piece, I argued that “one hallmark of President Donald Trump’s first three, turbulent months in office is his widespread, ominous attack on thought, belief and speech.”\n\nThe piece contained specific examples, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s alarming memo supporting deportation of Columbia University pro-Palestinian activist Mahmoud Khalil. Rubio said Khalil could be expelled for “expected beliefs…that are otherwise lawful.” What immigrants might believe in the future now can make them federal law enforcement targets.\n\nAnother far-reaching example I cited is Trump’s aggressive attack on speech promoting diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI). His executive order commanded federal agencies to “excise references to DEI and DEIA [“A” for accessibility] principles, under whatever name they may appear.” Also, Tufts University student Rumeysa Ozturk, of Turkey, was abducted off the street by masked officers because she co-wrote an op-ed critical of Israel. It was a terrifying sight, caught on video, which previously would have seemed more applicable to George Orwell’s dystopian and cautionary tale against totalitarianism and thought police in is novel “1984.” This is America in 2025.\n\nKilling that column was a death blow to my life as a Washington Post columnist. But I wrote two more articles to see if I could cope with the restrictions. That’s when I learned just how severe the policy is. In my next piece, I was not allowed to describe a potential pay raise for federal employees as “well-deserved” because of Post policy.\n\nAs a columnist, I can’t live with that level of constraint. A column without commentary made me a columnist without a column. I also was troubled by significant inconsistencies in the implementation of the policy. During this period, The Post allowed stronger, opinionated language by other staffers, including the words “viciousness,” “cruelty” and “meanness” to describe Trump’s actions.\n\nI’m gone from The Post, but only as a journalist. Many people understandably have canceled subscriptions to protest Bezos’s actions that have damaged the news organization’s integrity. I still subscribe, and read and support the enduring fine work of Post journalists in the newspaper and digitally.\n\nWhen Bezos bought The Post, he provided needed money, energy and direction. The Post continues to produce first rate journalism now, despite his morale-busting actions.\n\nThe Washington Post did not respond to TheWrap’s request for comment.

Jerry Nadler and Yvette Clarke, the network reported. \n\nBut Jeffries’ team was ready to dig in.\n\n“Leader Hakeem Jeffries is focused on taking back the House from the MAGA extremists who just ripped health care away from millions of Americans,” Jeffries senior adviser André Richardson told CNN.\n\n“However, if Team Gentrification wants a primary fight, our response will be forceful and unrelenting. We will teach them and all of their incumbents a painful lesson on June 23, 2026,” he warned.\n\nThe beef is unfolding as pressure builds on state and local Democrats in the city to back Mamdani in the general election over fears they could face primaries if they don’t join the coalition. Mamdani will face Republican Curtis Sliwa in November, but former Gov. Andrew Cuomo and incumbent Mayor Eric Adams will appear on minor party lines on the ballot.\n\nCuomo lost the primary to Mamdani, while Adams dropped out of the race with his sights set on an independent run.\n\nBrooklyn state Assemblywoman Phara Souffrant Forrest, a DSA member whose district overlaps with Jeffries’ congressional district, warned Jeffries to be careful what he wished for.\n\n“Weird threat to make since Hakeem already went after @JabariBrisport [DSA state senator]and I.How’d that go for him, again?,” Forrest said in a statement on X Thursday.\n\n“2022 Primary Results:SD 22 Jabari Brisport: 70.4%.

Our districts overlap and there is plenty of opportunity for collaboration on issues of shared importance,” Forrest said.\n\nJasmine Gripper, the co-chair of the local Working Families Party which supported Mamdani in the primary, also warned some House members they could face a fight.\n\n“If you are a mismatch, that does make you vulnerable to someone saying, ‘Maybe I’m a better match,’” she told CNN.\n\nBut Bronx Rep. Ritchie Torres, who endorsed Andrew Cuomo for mayor and could face a primary challenge next year, defended Jeffries and said any DSA challenge to the man who could be the first black Speaker of the House only benefits Donald Trump.\n\n“If you side against Jeffries,” Torres told The Post, “you’re doing the bidding of Donald Trump. You’re siding against the black political establishment in the US.”\n\nTorres accused DSA members of a “double standard” by not backing Kamala Harris for president while pressuring city Democrats to immediately endorse Mamdani for mayor. \n\nRobert Zimmerman, a Democratic National Committee member from New York and a close ally of Jeffries, also slammed the DSA for picking a fight instead of helping Democrats win the House majority.\n\n“The choice is clear: Hakeem Jeffries as House Speaker or Donald Trump continuing to rule without any checks or balances on his power,” Zimmerman told The Post.\n\n“The DSA is being dangerously counterproductive and hypocritical,” he said.\n\nSome lefty activists said one House member who could face a real primary challenge is Rep. Dan Goldman, who represents lower Manhattan and brownstone Brooklyn.\n\n“If Brad Lander ran against Goldman, we’d support him in a minute,” Arthur Schwartz, political director of the NY Progressive Action Network said, referring to the city comptroller, who lost in the primary for mayor but cross-endorsed Mamdani.\n\nThe tiff comes as Mamdani, the Democratic nominee for mayor, is trying to rally people around his candidacy who did not support him in the primary — particularly black and Jewish elected officials and their constituents. He and his campaign are conducting outreach campaigns with lawmakers and Democratic leaders to expand and consolidate his support heading into the general election.","summary":"A rift erupted between Zohran Mamdani's leftist Democratic Socialist allies and House Democratic Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, with threats of running primaries against each other.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/10/us-news/hakeem-jeffries-team-blasts-zohran-mamdanis-liberal-team-gentrification-as-primary-threats-spark-nyc-dem-feud/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-ygw002o36-1752190477187.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752176100&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ZPV40z8O-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-10 23:49:13","author":"Carl Campanile","authors":["Carl Campanile"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":340397544,"title":"Trump to Assess Flood Damage While Highlighting Strong Connection to Republican Texas","text":"President Trump is flaunting his bond with deep-red Texas ahead of a Friday trip to the state, where he will assess deadly flooding that took the lives of more than 120 people.\n\nGov. Greg Abbott (R) has heaped praise on the administration this week for the federal response to the disaster, even as the Trump administration has made cuts to the nation’s climate and weather agencies and officials continue to push axing the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).\n\nThe camaraderie stands in stark contrast to the the California wildfires in January, during which Trump and California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) played a blame game for weeks over water access, the loss of thousands of structures and a dozen deaths.\n\nCritics argue that Trump’s handling of both deadly disasters showcases how he tends to politicize such events.\n\nJeremy Edwards, a former Biden White House and FEMA spokesperson, said he suspects if the Texas flooding had occurred in a state run by a Democrat, Trump’s sentiments would be very different.\n\n“I find it very hard to imagine that if this exact situation were to happen in a blue state with a Democratic governor, he would not immediately lambast them for steps that they did or didn’t take with regards to emergency alerts,” Edwards said\n\nOther critics noted how Trump’s predecessors went to great lengths to support communities, no matter how they tended to lean politically. \n\n“What I’d seen during the Obama administration and the Biden administration is presidents working with governors, regardless of party, to support the impacted community, whether it was in Florida with Biden and Gov. [Ron] DeSantis working side by side following the Surfside building collapse, Hurricane Ian, Hurricane Milton … putting politics aside,” said Michael Coen, a former FEMA chief of staff in the Obama and Biden administrations.\n\n“Until this administration, I really haven’t seen emergency management being politicized the way it is,” Coen added.\n\nAbbott is expected to join Trump in Texas, where he will meet with first responders, receive a briefing from local elected officials and meet with family members of those affected, according to a White House official.\n\nFor his part, Newsom also greeted Trump on the tarmac in California when he visited the state shortly after he retook office, but before the trip, the president threatened to withhold federal wildfire aid because of concerns about the state’s water management.\n\nIn Texas, some other particulars are at play.\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which houses the National Weather Service (NWS), cut hundreds of staffers during a government overhaul earlier this year.\n\nAnd the warning coordination meteorologist for the NWS’s Austin-San Antonio office, who organizes the deployment of alerts about agency forecasts, took a Trump administration buyout in April.\n\nThat has put in the spotlight some of the cuts the Trump administration has implemented, and continues to threaten.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who is also expected to join Trump on the ground in Texas, this week said FEMA should be “remade” even as the agency responded to the floods and both Noem and Trump have insisted such disaster response should be managed by states.\n\n“We as a federal government don’t manage these disasters. The state does. We come in and support them, and that’s exactly what we did here in this situation,” she said.\n\nFEMA has especially been in the GOP’s crosshairs since Hurricane Helene hit North Carolina last year, a state Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris had been vying for during the 2024 election. \n\nThe North Carolina disaster was plagued by rumors that FEMA was avoiding red-leaning areas and not helping Republican households, at times hampering the response under former President Biden.\n\nA former Bush administration Homeland Security official said Trump’s response to the Texas floods comes amid a cascade of changes in federal government operations this year.\n\n“Disaster politics are always tricky, but this tragedy is amid the backdrop of DOGE and the administration’s broader efforts to reduce the federal role in disaster response,” the former Bush official said, referring to the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\n“The president and the governor get along well and are very simpatico on immigration, but these situations normally receive a level of empathy that this president does not like to display,” the former official added.\n\nThe president, meanwhile, doesn’t seem to think so. He has praised his alliance with Abbott, citing it as a factor in the unified response to the floods at a Cabinet meeting on Tuesday.\n\n“The relationship with Texas and the governor has been obviously very good for years, with me,” Trump said. “The response has been incredible, and the fact that we got along so well, I don’t even think that’s a political thing, but we got along so well, and it was so unified. I think a lot of lives have been saved.”\n\nBut, if the administration faces negative reviews over the response in Texas, some critics are bracing for a similar blame game Trump has leaned on in the past.\n\n“I think this is going to be the same thing he does with the economy. When the economy is bad, it’s Biden’s economy.

Experts said the lawsuit had little grounds and what CBS did was routine journalistic practice. \n\nThe situation is “something I’m very concerned about,” Anna Gomez said at a panel discussion at the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, which is meeting in Chicago this week. “I believe that the public interest requires us to look at how CBS acted in this case.”\n\nCritics have charged that CBS settled the suit to clear the way for governmental approval of a proposed merger of its parent company, Paramount, and Skydance Media. \n\nGomez, who was appointed to the FCC by former President Joe Biden, criticized CBS for its decision to settle, which she called “a private lawsuit against ’60 Minutes’ for reporting the news the way it should, for its editorial decisions.”\n\nTop officials with the news network left during settlement talks. Gomez charged that “CBS has now tempered how it reports the news. It pushed out the executive producer of ’60 Minutes,’ it pushed out the president of CBS News entirely to appease this president in a desperate attempt to get approval of this $8 billion to $9 billion merger by the FCC.\n\n“That is completely contrary — it is chilling and it is a very scary moment for our freedoms.” \n\nWhile CBS agreed to pay $16 million toward Trump’s future presidential library and legal fees, the network noted that it did not apologize for its actions. A CBS spokesperson could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nAt the forum, Gomez also expressed concern over efforts to lift FCC restrictions on local media ownership that she says ensure viewpoint diversity, competition and “localism.”\n\n“My concern is with the owners looking to lift ownership caps on local broadcasters. This is done under the guise of promoting local journalism. I think it’s the opposite of that. I think it’s being done for the benefit of billionaire companies,” she said.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/donald-trump/2025/07/10/60-minutes-donald-trump-settlement-federal-communications-commission-fcc-anna-gomez","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/77416ba/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+361/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fe9%2Ffd%2F488800ec4eed8666ca9ec3fd7643%2Fnahj","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 21:46:18","author":"Sun-Times staff","authors":["Sun-Times staff"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":340383922,"title":"Sarah Jessica Parker reveals why she won’t talk politics","text":"Sarah Jessica Parker has revealed why she rarely talks politics on social media – pointing out that elections were won and lost for centuries before the internet age.\n\nDuring an appearance on Nicolle Wallace’s The Best People podcast, Parker said she avoids having “complicated conversations” online.\n\n“I often don’t talk on social media because I don’t think it’s a place that’s deserving of any real complicated conversation.\n\n“I’m not interested in quick little snippets when it’s dealing with conflict or even elections sometimes,” she said.\n\nReferring to the presidential election, in which she endorsed Kamala Harris on Instagram, she added: “I really was so thoughtful about how I wanted to talk about the election because I think it turns into a distraction from a campaign.\n\n“It turns into fodder.

Billy Graham in political advertisements backing former Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential campaign. In a statement posted on social media, the group acknowledged that it did not obtain permission from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA) before using the clips. \"In the lead up to the 2024 presidential election, Evangelicals for America PAC's 'Evangelicals for Harris' campaign produced several ads using clips of Rev. Billy Graham. We did this believing that our use of the clips of Rev. Graham, although not done with the prior permission of the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association (BGEA), would meet the criteria for Fair Use under the US Copyright Act,\" the group wrote. The BGEA objected to the ads, claiming the group had infringed on its copyright by using video clips of Graham for political purposes without consent. REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM CALLS OUT ‘EVANGELICALS FOR HARRIS’ FOR ‘TRYING TO MISLEAD PEOPLE’ USING HIS FATHER IN AD \"Our intent was not to infringe on BGEA's copyright or to give the impression that Rev. Graham would have taken a side in publicly supporting one political candidate over another in an election, so we apologize to BGEA,\" Evangelicals for Harris said. The controversy started after the group released a series of attack ads against Trump that used footage of the late evangelist. One ad juxtaposed Graham's preaching about confession with a 2015 interview in which Trump said he wasn’t sure whether he had ever asked God for forgiveness. Rev. Franklin Graham, son of Billy Graham and president of Samaritan’s Purse and the BGEA, publicly criticized the efforts at the time. ‘EVANGELICALS FOR HARRIS’ COURTS ‘POLITICALLY HOMELESS’ CHRISTIANS TO BACK DEMOCRAT IN NOVEMBER \"The liberals are using anything and everything they can to promote candidate Harris. They even developed a political ad trying to use my father @BillyGraham’s image,\" Graham wrote in a social media post in August 2024. \"They are trying to mislead people. Maybe they don’t know that my father appreciated the conservative values and policies of President @realDonaldTrump in 2016, and if he were alive today, my father’s views and opinions would not have changed.\" In October, the group publicly vowed to fight legal threats from the BGEA. Months later, they retreated from this position, removing the ads and agreeing not to use any more clips of Graham or his organization without explicit permission. \"Our hope is that these actions and our commitment not to use Rev. Billy Graham within a partisan electoral context will clarify confusion over the message in our original ads; affirm the value and importance of Christian dialogue about the way we engage in politics, and prioritizes Christians remaining in communion despite differences,\" their Tuesday statement continued. The Billy Graham Evangelistic Association told Fox News Digital, \"Their apology speaks for itself, as does the original response from Franklin Graham. We are grateful for the outcome.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Evangelicals for Harris reportedly spent more than $1 million on ads targeting religious voters in swing states, arguing that Harris' policies and character were a more accurate reflection of Christian values than Trump's.","summary":"&quot;Evangelicals for Harris&quot; removed political ads featuring footage of the late Rev.

And to succeed, we need to be united as a team with a strong belief and passion in where we are heading.”\n\n“I understand and respect, however, that our chosen path is not for everyone,” he continued. “That’s exactly why we introduced the voluntary separation program. As we continue in this new direction, I want to ask those who do not feel aligned with the company’s plan to reflect on that. The VSP is designed to support you in making this decision, give you the ability to weigh your options thoughtfully and with less concern about financial consequences. And if you think that it’s time to move on to a new chapter, the VSP helps you take that next step with more security.”\n\n“Regardless of what you decide, I want to thank all of you for everything you have done for this organization. If you choose to move away from The Post, thank you for all your contributions, and I truly wish you the best of luck. If you believe in our next chapter, I’m excited for the work ahead of us,” Lewis concluded the memo. \n\nA spokesperson for The Washington Post declined to comment.\n\nLewis’ memo came less than two months after the paper launched its latest buyout program specifically targeting veteran staffers that would conclude at the end of July. \n\nAccording to a VSP document previously viewed by Fox News Digital, nine months of base pay would be given to staffers employed for 10-15 years, 12 months of base pay for 15-20-year veterans, 15 months of base pay for 20-25-year veterans and 18 months for anyone who has worked at the Post for more than 25 years. \n\nAll of them would also receive 12 months of pay credit in their Separate Retirement Account (SRA). \n\nThe Post has suffered a dramatic decline in subscriptions, which was further fueled by multiple boycott campaigns against the “Democracy Dies in Darkness” paper over decisions made by its billionaire owner Jeff Bezos. \n\nThe first was in October when Bezos halted the paper’s endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris just days before the November election. \n\nThe second was in February when Bezos announced his directive for the Post’s editorial pages to promote “personal liberties and free markets” and vowed not to publish pieces opposing those principles. \n\nBoth instances sparked a mass exodus of paid subscribers and several resignations, including opinion editor David Shipley, who opposed Bezos’ new policy. \n\nLast month, the Post tapped Adam O’Neal, formerly of The Economist and The Wall Street Journal, to lead the opinion pages.","summary":"Washington Post publisher and CEO Will Lewis is urging staffers who don't \"feel aligned\" with the paper's new direction to take a buyout and leave. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/10/media/washington-post-ceo-urges-staffers-who-dont-feel-aligned-with-paper-to-leave/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/newspress-collage-ef18xle3o-1752175097171.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1752160732&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 19:28:55","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.188},{"id":340366384,"title":"Longtime WaPo columnist quit after editors spiked column for being ‘too opinionated’","text":"Joe Davidson, the famed writer who had helmed The Washington Post's Federal Insider column for the past 17 years, revealed this week that he quit the paper in protest after one of his pieces was spiked for being “too opinionated under an unwritten and inconsistently enforced policy.”\n\nIn a lengthy Facebook post, Davidson also took numerous swipes at Jeff Bezos, the mega-billionaire owner of the Post who has openly cozied up to Donald Trump amid the president’s return to power.

When should you take back pain seriously?Nicholas Clark, an orthopedic spine surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery at Naples Comprehensive Health, which opened last month in Naples, Florida, told The Post, \"We are seeing a lot of patients present with pain after/during activities because of common spinal mistakes.\"He continued by saying that \"significant issues can arise over time, even though these issues may seem harmless.\" Before they break you, Clark outlines six surprisingly subtle habits to break.Live EventsOrthopedic experts say that if you don't treat them, they can cause chronic pain, disc problems, and even damage to the spine that lasts a long time.ALSO READ: Kamala Harris’ California governor bid sparks donor revolt: ‘Not backing her this time’ Here are six things you might do that could hurt your spine, along with detailed explanations of what they do, as per a report by The NY Post.1. Bad Lifting Techniques: If you lift things the wrong way, like bending at the waist instead of squatting, you can hurt your lower back and get serious injuries like disc herniations. If you lift kids wrong too often, this risk also applies to you. Bad lifting techniques can damage the structures of the spine, which can cause serious injuries that may need surgery to fix.2. Not Working on Core Strength: Weak core muscles don't do a good job of stabilizing the spine, which puts more strain on discs and ligaments when you move. Core strength is important for everyday tasks, and not working on it can cause back pain. Many people don't do exercises like crunches and planks that are important for the health of their spine because they only think of core workouts as a way to look good instead of as a way to improve functional stability.3. Ignoring Minor Discomfort: Don't ignore mild back pain or stiffness; it could be a sign of early problems like muscle strain or disc stress. Letting these symptoms go on can make things worse, like herniated discs or long-term arthritis. Getting medical help early can stop small problems from getting worse and causing big problems or permanent damage.4. Slouching While Sitting: A lot of people don't even know they're slouching when they sit for a long time at a desk or use a device. This position puts more stress on the discs in the spine and the muscles that support them, which could cause problems like forward head posture, kyphosis, or herniated discs. Bad posture can make your muscles weaker, which can make you more likely to get hurt when you move quickly.5. Too Much Device Use: Looking down at phones and tablets too much can cause \"tech neck,\" which makes the neck muscles work harder to hold up the head. This can cause long-term problems with spinal alignment, chronic back pain, and cervical disc degeneration. Over time, this stress can make the muscles in your neck and back weaker, which raises the risk of herniated discs and the pain that comes with them.6. Carrying Heavy Things Wrong: A lot of people don't think about how they are standing when they carry heavy things like bags or laptops. Carrying something on one shoulder makes the load uneven, which can cause muscle imbalances and possibly long-term pain or problems with the spine curving. Even small bags can hurt you over time, especially kids and people who ride the bus. People can better protect their spinal health and avoid long-term problems by recognizing and changing these habits.FAQsWhat simple habits are damaging your spine?Poor posture, carrying heavy bags, and ignoring early discomfort are just a few minor habits that can lead to serious back problems.Is occasional back pain a warning sign?Yes, mild aches can indicate underlying issues.

CBS and parent company Paramount agreed to settle Trump’s \"election interference\" lawsuit last week, setting the stage for a long-planned merger of Paramount and Skydance to become official once the FCC approves the deal. But Trump critics have blasted the settlement and Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Sen. Ben Ray Lujan, D-N.M., sent a letter addressing concerns on Thursday to FCC Commissioner Olivia Trusty, who was nominated earlier this year by Trump. \"We write today regarding the proposed merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media now pending before the FCC. Paramount’s recent agreement to settle for $16 million a frivolous lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump against CBS — a Paramount subsidiary — over its editorial decision-making raises serious questions about Paramount’s rationale for the settlement and its implications for media independence,\" Markey and Lujan wrote. PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP \"For that reason, we urge you to insist that the FCC conduct its merger review with the utmost transparency, including holding a full Commission vote on any order to approve the merger,\" they continued. \"The Paramount-Skydance merger is unique in the FCC’s storied history, with the sitting President actively litigating against a news organization whose parent is seeking FCC approval of a major media merger.\" Trump was seeking $20 billion in his lawsuit against CBS over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of election interference through unethical editing to make her appear more articulate leading up to the 2024 contest. The Democratic lawmakers blasted the lawsuit as \"baseless,\" but said \"Paramount has nevertheless agreed to settle that lawsuit for $16 million.\" Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone reportedly pushed for the settlement in hopes of paving the way for Trump’s FCC to approve the lucrative merger. LONGTIME '60 MINUTES' CORRESPONDENT STEVE KROFT, JON STEWART BASH CBS’ TRUMP SETTLEMENT AS ‘SHAKEDOWN’ \"This settlement casts a shadow over the proposed Paramount-Skydance merger and raises serious questions about the editorial independence of one of the nation’s largest media organizations. The Commission cannot turn a blind eye to this context,\" Markey and Lujan wrote. \"For that reason, in our May letter, we urged Chairman Carr to hold a vote on the merger by the full Commission, instead of unilaterally directing the Media Bureau to approve it on its delegated authority,\" they added. \"The FCC owes the public a transparent, deliberative process on such a high-profile and controversial issue,\" they added. The FCC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. TOP '60 MINUTES' PRODUCER RESIGNS FROM SHOW, CITES LACK OF INDEPENDENCE Fox News Digital has learned that the sum being paid to Trump could reach north of $30 million, with $16 million being paid upfront for his future presidential library, in addition to another eight-figure allocation set aside for advertisements, public service announcements or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes paid for by the network’s incoming ownership in the future. Paramount has defended the settlement. \"Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction,\" a Paramount spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

Ulysses S. Grant’s brother-in-law used his family ties to engineer an insider-trading scheme that tanked the gold market. Warren Harding’s secretary of the interior secretly leased land to oil barons, who paid a fortune for his troubles. To bankroll Richard Nixon’s reelection, corporate executives sneaked suitcases full of cash into the capital.\n\nBut Americans have never witnessed anything like the corruption that President Donald Trump and his inner circle have perpetrated in recent months. Its brazenness, volume, and variety defy historical comparison, even in a country with a centuries-long history of graft—including, notably, Trump’s first four years in office. Indeed, his second term makes the financial scandals of his first—foreign regimes staying at Trump’s hotel in Washington, D.C.; the (aborted) plan to host the G7 at Trump’s hotel in Florida—seem quaint.\n\nTrump 2.0 is just getting started, yet it already represents the high-water mark of American kleptocracy. There are good reasons to think it will get much worse.\n\nVirtually every week, the Trump family seems to find a new way to profit from the presidency. The Trump Organization has brokered a growing catalog of real-estate projects with autocratic regimes, including a Trump tower in Saudi Arabia, a Trump hotel in Oman, and a Trump golf club in Vietnam. “We’re the hottest brand in the world right now,” Eric Trump recently proclaimed. In May, Qatar gave the White House a $400 million jet—a gift that looked a lot like a bribe but that Trump had no qualms accepting.\n\nAnd that’s just the foreign front. Domestically, Trump has used flimsy complaints to go after media organizations, resulting in settlements that resemble shakedowns. Last year, he accused 60 Minutes of deceptively editing an interview with his Democratic presidential opponent, Kamala Harris. Legal experts saw the claim as weak. Rather than fighting it in court, however, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million, which will subsidize Trump’s future presidential library and cover his legal fees. Following a similarly dubious lawsuit, ABC sent $15 million to Trump’s library fund and issued a “statement of regret.”\n\nBeyond the court, the president has peddled Trump perfumes, Trump sneakers, and Trump phones, shamelessly using the prestige of the presidency to boost his family’s income. And then there’s crypto: the $TRUMP meme coin, the pay-to-play dinners with investors, the paused prosecution of a crypto kingpin who had purchased $30 million in Trump-backed tokens.\n\n“The law is totally on my side,” Trump said after his election in 2016, when he was asked about mixing his financial affairs with his new office. “The president can’t have a conflict of interest.” That statement is now alarmingly close to the truth. Thanks to last year’s Supreme Court ruling, Trump has presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution for any “official act.” He has appointed an attorney general, Pam Bondi, who appears willing to do his bidding no matter the cost to the Department of Justice. He has gutted independent bodies that went after white-collar criminal networks, task forces that investigated kleptocracy, public prosecutors that chased public corruption, and regulation that targeted transnational money laundering.\n\nThe list goes on. Trump’s Treasury Department effectively terminated America’s new shell-company registry. His DOJ dissolved task forces that seized stolen assets. The administration froze the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the bedrock of America’s antibribery regime. In sum, Trump has dismantled a network of agencies, laws, and norms that thwarted all kinds of kleptocracy, including the kind that enriches a sitting president.\n\nForeign agents are watching as America’s anti-corruption regime crumbles. They see an extraordinary window of opportunity, and they know they’ll have to act quickly to take full advantage. Succoring Trump and his family has already proved one of the fastest ways to guarantee favorable policy. Are U.S. sanctions hurting your economy? Consider building a Trump resort. Want to stay in America’s good graces? Invest in Trump-backed crypto.\n\nAll of this grafting is likely to accelerate. Consider the Qatari jet. The gift prompted plenty of hand-wringing in the United States, but also in the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, which saw their regional foe gain leverage over them by charming Trump. Don’t think of the jet as the culmination of the president’s greed; think of it as the new bar for bids to come. Any Middle Eastern dictator who wants to surpass Qatar in America’s estimation now knows his price.\n\nIn India, oligarchs and other government allies are opening Trump properties in rapid succession, while Pakistan recently announced a new national crypto reserve, signing a “letter of intent” to work with a Trump-backed group. Serbia and Albania have both recently vied for Trump’s affections, each signing deals for luxury properties with his family. The incentive to out-bribe one’s competition could soon take hold in geopolitical rivalries around the world.\n\nPerhaps most worrisome is the tacit permission that Trump granted foreign powers to directly bankroll U.S. politicians. This was the precedent he set when he strong-armed prosecutors into dropping the case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, who was accused of soliciting campaign funds from Turkey. “You win the race by raising money,” Adams said. “Everything else is fluff.” One could imagine the president saying the same.\n\nForeign regimes are beginning to see just how far their money can go in Trump’s America. The highest bidder has never had so much to gain.","summary":"Trump’s Qatari jet was just the beginning.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/trump-corruption-foreign-regimes/683487/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/c57zXwx9dyhyXJ-lge0cpnVOtBw=/0x480:2000x1522/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/07/TrumpCorruption-1/original.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-10 14:59:00","author":"Casey Michel","authors":["Casey Michel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.099},{"id":340294368,"title":"Will Zohran Mamdani Become the Democrat Party’s Trump?","text":"Americans’ trust in the corporate media has cratered. And with good reason: After decades of deception and distortion—considering its uncritical coverage of the wars in the Middle East, its peddling of the Trump-Russia collusion narrative, its inconsistent reporting on COVID-19, its selective ignorance during the 2020 election, and its efforts to conceal President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline—the corporate press has earned every ounce of the public’s suspicion.\n\nNow, Americans are tuning out the noise and tuning in to new voices to stay informed. UnHerd Washington Correspondent Emily Jashinsky has emerged as one of those voices. She joined “The Signal Sitdown” this week to discuss her new show with Megyn Kelly’s MK Media, “After Party with Emily Jashinsky,” the fallout from President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” and whether or not Zohran Mamdani represents the future of the national Democratic Party.\n\n“I’m very weirdly optimistic,” Jashinsky said of the alternative media’s rise. “I feel so strange about this because one of the reasons I got into media is because I’ve always been obsessed with media and I’ve always been so pessimistic. But the last, I don’t know, year or two, I’ve started to feel optimistic about media, not because there aren’t still very powerful bad actors, not because some of the new actors aren’t also bad, but because the demand for transparency from the audience, I think, is pushing us in at least a better direction.”\n\nJashinsky told The Daily Signal that the age of new media will be dominated by journalists who are able to “establish trust with [their] audience and to best establish transparency.” Jashinsky cited how “60 Minutes” selectively edited the interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat presidential nominee. “People were demanding the transcript, and I think that’s the way people like us, our age and younger, want to consume news.”\n\n“They really don’t want it to look or feel edited,” Jashinsky added. “There’s probably always going to be some editing, but they want stuff that’s live. We want stuff that’s transparent.”\n\nThe same can be said of alternative media’s class of commentators like Megyn Kelly and Tucker Carlson. “I think we’re in the golden age of reported commentary,” Jashinsky said. On digital shows and podcasts, “you’re able to do reported commentary on the fly in a way that, I think, is even more authentic and in a way that really resonates.”\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s ability to tap into the independent media ecosystem and the public’s craving for authenticity helped build a political coalition that propelled him back to the White House. \n\nThe breadth of that coalition, however, is both a blessing and a curse as the variety of interests within Trump’s camp compete for the president’s ear as he tries to act on his campaign promises. On July 4, Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the massive budget reconciliation package that delivered on many of those promises, into law. \n\n”When you have very narrow margins in the House and a very narrow margin in the Senate, you end up absolutely having to keep a coalition together that includes [Rep.] Chip Roy and either [Sen.] Lisa Murkowski or [Sen.] Susan Collins,” Jashinsky said. That is no easy task. “What they need to do is get Chip Roy to a place where he is sufficiently satisfied, and they need to get Lisa Murkowski to a place where she’s sufficiently satisfied,” she explained. “In order to do that, both of those things are necessarily going to mean swallowing a very bitter pill, and it was always going to be the case.\n\n“I think that’s why Trump started, from the very beginning of the process, by branding this as the one big beautiful bill because he knew that tax cuts expire at the end of the year,” the journalist added. “Republicans were facing the choice of either do a ugly reconciliation bill or let taxes go up. Obviously, they’re going to decide with an ugly reconciliation bill.”\n\n“That’s something I think Elon Musk missed,” Jashinsky said of the feud between Trump and Musk that started during the budget reconciliation negotiations. “I think Elon Musk has been shockingly naive throughout this process, and I do really think that it’s naive thinking that you can just kind of come into Washington and convince the Republican Party that has these narrow margins that they have to do some type of generational action to take on government spending when the only way to pass legislation and get it to the president’s desk is, again, to please either a Murkowski or Collins and the moderates while also pleasing the Chip Roys and the Freedom Caucus guys.”\n\n“It was never gonna happen,” Jashinksy said.\n\nNevertheless, Trump was able to accomplish much more of his agenda in this budget reconciliation package than budget reconciliation packages from his first term. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act not only extended and made permanent tax cuts in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act but also procured billions to secure the border, deport millions of illegal migrants, and revitalize the military.\n\nSome Democrats, however, are plotting the party’s comeback—New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani among them. Mamdani is officially infamous, constantly drawing ire from the long-time New Yorker who now lives in D.C. at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. and courting support from some of the nation’s top Democrats. Will Democrats remake the party in Mamdani’s image?\n\nPotentially, Jashinsky said, but Mamdani’s coalition in New York might be much more fragile than it seems, and his victory in the Democrat primary for mayor might have more to do with New Yorkers’ hatred for his opponent, disgraced former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. To maintain his coalition, Mamdani needs to thread the needle.\n\n“You have to bring the progressives in with the cultural libertarians, and then you need to bring them in with the … upwardly mobile, affluent, educated, higher income people,” Jashinsky explained. The catch? To earn the support of New York’s cocktail party class, “you do have to do some of the cultural signaling, which is very interesting. And that’s what puts off the [cultural libertarians].”\n\n“I think the likeliest case scenario is that Mamdani has a somewhat embarrassing defeat at the hands of Eric Adams, another terrible candidate, and that sort of chills the fever for him nationwide, but who knows,” Jashinsky told The Daily Signal.

Every election season, the word ‘clown’ resurfaces to compare tumultuous Washington politics to a circus. Political commentators and social media users are not the only ones who wrongfully sling this jibe. ‘Clown’ is used by almost everyone to belittle those seen as foolish or incompetent. The more we mistreat the word, the more we lose understanding of a sacred art form.”\n\nHe then suggests that people should “find a better metaphor to despise and depose fascism. Keep Clown out of Trumpian comparisons, and for that matter, all politics. Offer Clown the respect it deserves and invoke us for good: in alliance with other artists, activists and humans who believe in a better, happier world.”\n\nFinally, Cunningham concludes, “For centuries clowns have been uniting people in laughter, levity and creativity. That’s what real clowns have to offer. If you’re still stuck on the broken comparison ingrained in our national dialogue, here’s an alternative: Try ‘buffoon.’”\n\nOkay, fine. The Washington Post is full of buffoons, and all the people who thought Bezos’s decision to forbid the paper from endorsing Kamala Harris was evidence that Bezos would turn the paper into a Trump-friendly publication are also buffoons.","summary":"Democracy dies in darkness… or clown noises; The Washington Post isn’t quite sure which.

In response to a “Politics War Room” listener’s question asking why Democrats are “fighting so hard for DEI,” Carville asserted the premise of the question was wrong, claiming it is now a universal belief that DEI is disastrous — before clarifying his criticism was broader than just DEI. (RELATED: Another Major Corporation Bends The Knee To Trump)\n\n“They don’t [fight for DEI]. And everybody is trying to get away from it. I read a story, [Democratic New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] AOC has scrubbed her site of pronouns,” Carville said. “Everybody knows this has been a big, giant, massive disaster. So there are two kinds of people in this debate. There are people like me that said, ‘This is a disaster and we’re still trying to wash the stench of this shit off. Every year that goes by, we get a little bit of a less stench. It was really stupid.'”\n\n“Then you have people say, ‘Well, it probably wasn’t that great an idea, but no one talks about it, so it didn’t hurt us in the election.’ Bullshit, it hurt us in the election,” he continued. “The whole thing hurt us. It hurt the image of the party. No one that I know of is really promoting this crap anymore. Maybe it’s some couple of museums and foundations. That’s about all that’s left for this nonsense.”\n\nCarville then said he felt compelled to clarify that his tirade was also focused on identity politics generally rather than solely DEI.\n\n“I need to clean something up here. When I was going on this rant about DEI, what was really at the core of it was the whole identity politics movement, of which clearly DEI was a part of,” he said. “But do I think that diversity should be a part of everything? I obviously do.”\n\n“The DEI was conflating that with a lot of the identity movement … you had these people coming up saying how not to be this and they were shaking companies down. They were doing seminars on how to not be a racist and stuff,” he added. “And people resented it. And I can understand that. No one wants to sit on a Saturday morning being mandated to be told that you’re some kind of awful human being. That part was definitely a racket. But I generally want to be clear — I’m generally supportive of any effort to bring more diversity to the organization.”\n\nSince President Donald Trump returned to the White House in January, businesses like Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Target, Walmart, Boeing, Verizon and T-Mobile have begun to eliminate or scale back their DEI programs.\n\nPortraying former Vice President Kamala Harris and the Democratic Party as too far left on transgender issues was one of the most potent advertising campaigns in boosting support for Trump and Republican candidates down the ballot during the 2024 election, according to multiple reports. Two ads in particular featured the line, “Kamala is for they/them, Donald Trump is for you.”\n\nTrump’s second term has included endeavors to cut DEI out of the workforce and schools through executive orders, such as an one mandating the Labor Department eliminate affirmative action terms from federal contracts.\n\nThe University of Pennsylvania also agreed with the Trump administration on July 1 to strip transgender swimmer Lia Thomas of previous records and titles while competing in women’s swimming.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
