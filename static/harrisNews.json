What exactly would you like to ask? Be more specific, if you don’t mind,” the ex-veep, sounding confused, asked Ferguson. \n\nThe reporter reiterated the question about Biden’s “frailties.” \n\n“He was not frail as president of the United States,” Harris wildly claimed. \n\nTo which the reporter shot back: “But he had frailties. We all saw the debate.” \n\nHarris maintained that Biden “had the capacity to be president” and that she “never doubted that he had the capacity to be president.” \n\nShe would only concede that she had “concerns” about the then-81-year-old president’s ability to handle the rigors of a presidential campaign. \n\n“Is there a reason why you won’t go to that prolonged frailty question?” Ferguson pressed. \n\n“I have answered that question,” Harris insisted. “I do not believe [Biden was frail].”","summary":"Harris, long been hesitant to criticize Biden publicly, went on a minute-long rant about Trump when asked if her former boss’ “refusal to recognize his own frailties” cost her the 2024 election.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/30/us-news/kamala-harris-world-class-pivot-when-asked-about-bidens-frailties-floors-journalist/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/us-president-joe-biden-looks-114499242.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wzn89szs-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-30 23:54:07","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":374267980,"title":"Gayle King Done at 'CBS Mornings': Longtime Anchor 'to Depart Show' After Months of 'Woke' Backlash and $15Million Yearly Salary","text":"Gayle King is reportedly losing her 14-year reign lording over CBS Mornings as the lead host when her contract expires in May 2026, RadarOnline.com can reveal. \n\nThe wrath of the new CBS News boss, Bari Weiss, has seemingly hit ultra-liberal King, 70, as she is trying to steer the division away from its current \"woke\" status.A 'Valued' Part of CBSFour sources with knowledge of the situation told Variety the network hopes King will still call CBS home through a deal to produce her own programming, but that her days anchoring the morning show are coming to a close.\n\nThe Tiffany network said in a statement, \"There have been no discussions with Gayle about her contract that runs through May 2026.

Another said staff are 'running scared.'\n\n'I'd say that she's definitely going to make her mark,' a third source said. 'She's in charge, and we know it. We are being flooded in memos. She's watching every aspect of what we do, critiquing where she thinks we are being more biased. There is mandatory training to make sure we're objective, but it's really just telling us how to make sure to tell the conservative side of stuff.'\n\nFollowing Wednesday's news of job cuts, that third source texted the Daily Mail: 'Are you hiring?'\n\nPerhaps no greater endorsement of Weiss came this month in the form of whining Guardian column, breathlessly headlined: 'Bari Weiss is a weird and worrisome choice as top editor for CBS News.'\n\nDavid Ellison isn't worried.\n\nFollowing the buyout of Paramount by Ellison's media production company Skydance in an $8 billion deal this August, the son of Larry Ellison – the software entrepreneur and second-richest man in the world – turned his attention to Weiss's Free Press.\n\nAfter dramatically quitting The New York Times in 2020 – at the height of the George Floyd protests – and publishing an open essay criticizing the 'hostile work environment' at a paper beset by liberal 'tribalism,' Weiss decided to launch her own news website despite difficulties being felt across the media industry.\n\nHer mission statement was simple: The Free Press, she said, would be 'built on the ideals that once were the bedrock of great American journalism: honesty, doggedness, and fierce independence.\n\n'We publish investigative stories and provocative commentary about the world as it actually is – with the quality once expected from the legacy press, but the fearlessness of the new.'\n\nTo call it a runaway success would be a profound understatement.\n\nWhat started as a Substack run out of Weiss's Los Angeles kitchen morphed into a powerhouse newsroom with more than 1.5 million paying subscribers, 50 employees and offices on both coasts – all in less than three years.\n\nEarlier this month, Ellison bought the site for a reported $150 million in cash and Paramount stock.\n\nWeiss remains in charge of the site while also taking on her new role at CBS.\n\nWriting in a letter to all CBS staff on her first day, Weiss reiterated those principles of 'factual' and 'fair' reporting once again.\n\n'Journalism that embraces a wide spectrum of views and voices,' she wrote.\n\nHer appointment has been welcomed by the White House and the president himself.\n\nIn July, Paramount paid a $16 million settlement to Trump after he sued over a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris on CBS's flagship show 60 Minutes, which he said had been selectively edited.\n\nCut forward to October 14, Weiss's seventh day at the office, and the network's new boss had a simple question for a room full of 60 Minutes producers.\n\nWhy, she is reported to have asked, does the country think you are biased?\n\nHer question is said to have been met with 'stunned awkwardness.'\n\nA few days prior, on October 9, she had told staff to be 'more aggressive' in booking guests, pointing out that she had personally texted Hillary Clinton to invite her to discuss the Israel-Hamas ceasefire on TV.\n\nShe had also secured interviews with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu – Weiss is Jewish and a self-proclaimed Zionist – and Trump's Gaza team, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner.\n\nShe's reportedly been in talks with major conservative news hosts and commentators – among them Fox News anchor Bret Baier and CNN's Scott Jennings – looking to make fresh hires.\n\n'I love to win,' she is said to have told a group of senior producers.\n\n'Everyone is stepping it up at work and in the meetings she is in,' one senior writer who has worked at CBS for 15 years told the Daily Mail. 'The news division is freaking out.'\n\n'Everyone is waiting for the shoe to drop,' said a 60 Minutes producer.

Neither one of them should be president for one simple reason. For both of them, their entire political careers have been focused on one goal: how to get to the presidency.\n\nI’m a lifelong Democrat, but I won’t be voting for either of these two. We can’t afford a president whose only purpose in life is to be president. We need a president whose goal is to get things done and who has proven he or she knows how to do that.\n\nPlease, voters of California and the nation, let’s nominate and elect a real worker, a governor or mayor who has a record of getting things done, who knows how to build and inspire, and who is not in politics just to climb the ladder to the top job.\n\nNeil Macneale\n\nWorld must focus on\nUkraine’s missing kids\n\nThere should be a worldwide daily campaign called “Return the Children” supported by the nations of the world and the United Nations, demanding that Vladimir Putin return the estimated more than 19,000 Ukrainian children he ordered kidnapped in Ukraine.

The charge is easy to make — but it is fallacious.\n\nGenocide is the attempt to totally wipe out any group based on “ethnicity, religion, physical traits, or common heritage.”\n\nNone of those apply in this case.\n\nIsrael is trying to eliminate the ability of Hamas — a U.S.- and U.N.-designated terrorist organization — to make war. The war is not against the Palestinian people (though of course, inevitably, many become casualties).\n\nWhile everyone agrees the war is terrible and needs to be ended, let’s not forget the U.S. — and others — have done exactly as Israel is doing. In World War II, we fought against Japan and Germany for exactly the same reasons — to end the ability of their national leaders to make war. We insisted on unconditional surrender. Our nation supported that position wholeheartedly. This is simply the same case today.\n\nNorm Watson\nScotts Valley\n\nS.F. must invest more\nin homelessness fight\n\nHomelessness in San Francisco remains one of the city’s most urgent challenges. Despite significant funding and numerous initiatives, thousands of residents still live without stable housing.\n\nWalking through the Tenderloin, SoMa or along Market Street, it is clear that this crisis affects not only those experiencing homelessness but the entire community. Rising rent prices, a shortage of affordable housing, and untreated mental health and addiction issues have deepened the problem.

On Monday, in an exchange with reporters during his Asia trip, Trump, referring to the third term idea, said, “I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever,” Reuters quoted him as saying.\n\nWhen a reporter asked whether he was not ruling out a third term, Trump replied, “Am I not ruling it out? I mean, you’ll have to tell me.”\n\nHis acolytes have been promoting the prospect. Trump craves power and won’t easily relinquish it.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution’s 22nd Amendment would appear to prohibit Trump from another presidential term, according to legal scholars. If he does go down the third term road, a bevy of court challenges will take it to the U.S. Supreme Court. Since Trump enjoys a favorable reception from that body, brace for the possibility that it will give him the nod.\n\nWait. There could be an upside for Trump opponents. It’s a stretch, but maybe, just maybe, a big, ripe plum could drop from the tree. That juicy fruit’s name is Barack Hussein Obama.\n\nIf Trump can run for a third term, so can his ultimate nemesis.\n\nFormer President Obama could mount a comeback to take Trump out and save our democracy. Would he or wouldn’t he? (Only Michelle knows for sure.)\n\nThere is no stronger candidate for the Democratic Party than Obama. A recent poll found that Obama far outstrips Trump in popularity. “The poll found that 42% of Americans said they view Trump favorably, while 57% said they view him unfavorably, leaving the president with a net favorability -15 points,” according to an Oct. 1 report in Newsweek magazine.\n\nMeanwhile, 57% of Americans said they view Obama favorably, while 40% saying they view him unfavorably, for a net favorability of +17 points.\n\nThe poll, conducted in September by Marquette University Law School, surveyed 1,005 adults nationwide, with a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.\n\nObama’s “personal appeal, inspirational rhetoric, and unanticipated success in the 2008 presidential race continue to have strong public support,” Meena Bose, executive dean of Hofstra University’s Peter S. Kalikow School of Government, Public Policy and International Affairs, told Newsweek.\n\n“The promise of hope and change are defining features of the Obama presidential campaign and still influence assessments of his presidency,” Bose added.\n\nTrump knows just how dangerous Obama is. That’s why Trump has been attacking, demeaning and undermining Obama since he entered national politics.\n\nThe biggest political challenge the Democrats face today is not Trump and his scorched-earth assault on democracy, social justice and equity, and all the other things their party cherishes.\n\nTheir overarching problem is that there is no leadership at the top. A horde of prominent Democrats aspire to take on Trump, but no one has been able to capture the prevailing imagination and allegiance of the party’s base.\n\nThe list of Democratic hopefuls is mind-bogglingly long. Nationally known governors, including JB Pritzker, Gretchen Whitmer, Gavin Newsom, Wes Moore and Josh Shapiro, as well U.S. senators, including Cory Booker, Chris Murphy, Adam Schiff, John Fetterman and more.\n\nKamala Harris, the Democrats’ 2024 presidential nominee, recently suggested she might consider another run.\n\nHowever, a contest among these aspirants would be a squabble in a teapot. None have Obama’s experience, charisma and vote-getting ability. He would clobber everyone else in the ring and clear that field.\n\nWith the specter of another Trump presidential term, Obama would energize the party’s base. Latino voters will reconsider their past support for Trump, whose administration vows to give every immigrant in the nation a one-way ticket to Palookaville.\n\nProgressives have their problems with Obama, but he would be the only one standing among the Democratic White House hopefuls. All others would fade away in comparison.\n\nImagine, Obama versus Trump. In 2028, Obama will be sharp at 67. Trump, an 82-year-old dinosaur. That’s a match with betting odds that would favor the Democrats. FanDuel and DraftKings would have a tough time finding Republicans to bet on Trump.\n\nA challenge from Obama would put Trump into an unprecedented tizzy. Obama won a Nobel Peace Prize, something Trump craves but knows he will never get.\n\nLet’s hope Trump won’t be in the ring in 2028, but if he is, there is one powerhouse candidate to take him on. If Trump wants to open the third-term door, bring on Obama.\n\nLaura Washington is a political commentator and longtime Chicago journalist.

In the entire debate, which was Bragg against Republican Maud Maron and independent Diana Florence, moderated by NY1’s Errol Louis — in the entire debate, nobody said the name “Donald Trump.” With the exception of one brief aside by Louis, nobody mentioned the Trump prosecution at all. \n\nThe trial is the biggest professional accomplishment of Bragg’s life. He is now running for reelection. He is running on his record. And he never said a word about it. Nor did Maron or Florence bring it up. It was like Bragg’s central role in history never happened at all.\n\nBragg had plenty of opportunities. At one point, he boasted about the political figures he had prosecuted. “These are cases I did directly, some I oversaw, prosecuted two mayors, a Senate majority leader, a council member, and an FBI agent without regard to their political party … without fear or favor,” Bragg said. Then he stopped.\n\n“I think there was an ex-president in there, too,” Louis said before asking Maron if she would like to comment. “I noticed that Mr. Bragg skipped that one when he was running through the politicians that he prosecuted,” Maron said. Then she moved on.\n\nThat was it. One of the most consequential cases in U.S. history, and the man who conducted it, and his opponents, didn’t want to talk about it. What is going on?\n\nA few things. First, the debate started, and largely focused on, the street crime that diminishes New York’s quality of life. That is an absolutely critical issue, and both Maron and Florence ripped into Bragg’s record. Maron pointed out that Bragg dismisses more than 60% of the cases his office brings and convicts on just 35%. Felony assaults on the subway are up. \n\nFlorence focused on a single case — a man named Justin Washington, who in 2022 was accused of raping a teenage relative. Bragg let him off easy with a plea bargain under which he would serve just 30 days in jail. But then: “Before he would spend one moment in jail, weeks later, Washington went to the Bronx and assaulted five more New Yorkers sexually,” Florence said.\n\nMaron promised that if elected, “The first thing I would do is rip up Alvin Bragg’s day-one memo, because it is a memo from a prosecutor talking about all the ways in which he will not prosecute crime in this city.” That was a reference to a memo Bragg sent to his staff on his first day in office in January 2022. In the letter, Bragg, in the words of a Manhattan Institute analysis, “set out a number of controversial directives, such as non-prosecution of crimes including resisting arrest, trespassing, fare evasion, and prostitution. Bragg’s office would broadly reduce charges for crimes including knifepoint robbery, commercial and some residential burglaries, weapons possession, and ‘low-level’ drug dealing. There will be a presumption of no jail time for almost any crime, and sentences of life without parole will be banned even for cop killers, barring ‘exceptional circumstances.’”\n\nBragg’s defense when Maron brought up the memo was to say it was “overridden within days.” Indeed, it was, because it caused an uproar among New Yorkers who had a fit of buyer’s remorse as the new Manhattan DA took office. Bragg quickly amended the memo, but he fundamentally stayed the same soft-on-prosecutor he was before.\n\nOf course, Bragg was a very, very tough prosecutor when it came to one defendant: Trump. There’s no need to go through the whole story of Bragg’s 34-count indictment of Trump. It charged Trump with committing bookkeeping offenses as part of a conspiracy to corrupt the 2016 presidential election; the specific crime was said to be labeling a nondisclosure agreement negotiated by Trump’s lawyer as a “legal expense” in Trump Organization books. For that, Bragg charged Trump with 34 felonies — enough to theoretically send the former president to jail for 136 years. \n\nIt was crazy, of course. But very, very tough. And since prosecuting a former president on so many counts is a big undertaking, it was quite expensive. But remember — no one is above the law in Alvin Bragg’s world.\n\nHere is what is amazing about the lack of any discussion of the Trump case during the debate. Prosecutors in New York, as elsewhere, have to focus. They have to go after big crimes, but also the smaller crimes that eat away at New Yorkers’ quality of life. Why would Bragg pledge to go easy on petty crime when drug stores were locking up their toothpaste and shampoo, and customers had to ask a clerk to unlock a cabinet so they could buy something? \n\nAnd why, when civic disorder descends, did Bragg devote so many resources to pursuing Trump for a “crime” that few analysts, much less ordinary citizens, could really understand? (The New York Times politely wrote that “the intricate theory underpinning the charges drew skepticism from many in the legal world.”) Yes, Bragg got a conviction, only to see the whole thing go away after Trump was elected president. But Bragg had revealed his priorities.\n\nAnd now, as he runs for reelection, he doesn’t want to talk about his great achievement. On the campaign trail, he has avoided the subject so assiduously that people have noticed. Last week, the Times ran a story headlined, “Alvin Bragg, Seeking Re-election, Is Not Mentioning His Best-Known Case.” If you want to get Bragg talking, the paper said, you better not mention the Trump prosecution. Some voters bring it up at events — they like it, of course — but Bragg says nothing.\n\nAnd what about his opponents? Well, they know that exactly 17.6% of Manhattan voters voted for Trump in 2024, versus 82.4% who voted for Kamala Harris. What is in it for Maron and Florence to tear into Bragg for prosecuting a president so unpopular in Manhattan?\n\nOn the other hand, what about noting that, while some serious types of crime rose and theft-weary stores put toothpaste under lock and key, Bragg was pushing his office into a case against Trump that even experts on his side thought was weak and poorly conceived. Shouldn’t that be something voters consider when deciding whether to reelect him?\n\nThere was a final telling moment near the end of the debate, when moderator Errol Louis brought up white collar crime. “I think what we’ve seen out of Alvin Bragg … is too little focus on corruption cases and too much focus on prosecuting political enemies,” Maud Maron said. \n\nWould that have been a good time to mention one particular case? Of course it would have been. But Maron moved on, as did Florence. And of course Bragg said nothing about Trump — the trial that, apparently, never happened.","summary":"ALVIN BRAGG AND THE TRUMP TRIAL THAT NEVER HAPPENED.&#160;There was a curious moment in New York City politics a few nights ago, but you might have missed it because of all the attention being paid to the mayor’s race.

Sources speculated that the network’s new editor in chief Bari Weiss, who’s known for her staunchly pro-Israel views, played a role in the decision to ax the 61-year-old reporter.\n\nPatta signed a new three-year contract in August, according to a source with knowledge of the matter, who added that CBS is not giving her a full payout.\n\nA former CBS staffer said the network may not have an obligation to do so. That depends on what her contract stipulates — which may make a breach-of-contract claim unlikely.\n\n“She is probably looking to sue over her Middle East coverage,” the person said.\n\nCBS News declined to comment. Patta did not return multiple requests for comment.\n\nIt’s unclear whether David Ellison, CEO of CBS News parent Paramount Skydance, played a role in Patta’s firing. He previously voiced a commitment to unbiased journalism to Federal Communications Commission chair Brendan Carr — a condition for the agency to OK this past summer’s $8 billion merger between Skydance and Paramount.\n\nBoth Carr and President Trump have accused CBS News of liberal bias. In July, the network paid $16 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit accusing CBS News of “deceptively” editing a “60 Minutes” interview to make his 2024 opponent Kamala Harris look better.\n\nHuckabee put Patta on blast when he accused CBS News of intentionally editing his four-minute sitdown with her to craft a “different story than the one they had.” The former Arkansas governor claimed on X on Aug. 8 that his comments on reports of starvation in Gaza were misrepresented.\n\n“Ever wonder how the media edits an interview to give you a different story than the one they had?” Huckabee wrote.\n\nHe then added a link to the full transcript on the US embassy website, showing what was edited out of the CBS News interview. For instance, Patta asked Huckabee whether he is “deeply troubled by images of starving children.” Huckabee replied, “I’m moved when the photos are verified.”\n\nIn the unedited exchange, Huckabee answered: “I’m moved when the photos are verified. I mean, we’re all moved when you see someone, especially a child who’s starving. But the New York Times published a picture on the front page of what was purported to be a starving child. Turns out the child had a birth defect and had not been starving.”\n\nHe continued: “There were other pictures, for example, that were published of starving children in Gaza. Turned out one of them was from Yemen. One was from 2017. There was another photo that appeared to be somewhat staged, with photographer all set up to get pictures of a few people herded into a small area.”\n\nThe interview closed with Patta asking Huckabee about claims that Israel was committing genocide in Gaza.\n\n“If Israel is attempting genocide, they’re really, really bad at it. They could have had genocide on October the 8th,” Huckabee said in the aired piece.\n\nIn the full exchange, he said: “They could have dropped a few bombs and have annihilated all Gazans, it’s not that big an area. They certainly had the capacity to do it, and saw that in the 12-day war with Iran. It is the most ridiculous thing in the world to say that Israel is committing genocide. That’s absurd. On its face, it’s absurd. If they were trying to commit genocide, it would not have taken them 22 months.”\n\nStill, Patta’s exit after 12 years at CBS News came as a shock inside the network.\n\n“Top CBS News executives were appalled by the decision,” a source said, noting that the hard-charging Patta has reported in conflict zones including Syria and Ukraine, in addition to the Israel-Hamas war.\n\nPatta has also led many of the network’s best investigations in recent years, the person added.\n\nHer exit leaves a gaping hole as many correspondents in Europe “refuse” to set foot in conflict zones, the person said.\n\n“It will be very challenging to cover the news,” the source added.","summary":"Sources speculated that newly-minted CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss -- who is pro-Israel -- played any role in the decision to oust Patta.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/30/media/ex-cbs-reporter-debora-patta-fired-in-wake-of-controversial-gaza-reporting-may-sue-network-source/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/u-s-negotiators-remain-working-114497157.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/PYL0zvWU-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-30 20:58:38","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":374229830,"title":"Jake Tapper says BLM failures will make Gen Z 'a lot more' conservative than millennials","text":"Jake Tapper has said on a podcast that he believes members of Gen Z will be 'a lot more' conservative than millennials and Gen Xers thanks to the failure of Black Lives Matter and other left-wing movements in the United States.\n\nThe 56-year-old CNN host made the prediction during an episode of libertarian journalist Nick Gillespie's ReasonTV show that aired Wednesday.\n\n'My impression of Millennials, and obviously there are exceptions, but they're fairly progressive.

After Harris repeated the claim on his podcast, Stewart told the former vice president he believed she actually would have won had the campaign been shorter. (RELATED: Kayleigh McEnany Derides Kamala Harris For Blaming Biden White House For Bad Reputation)\n\n“I do believe one of the biggest factors that was at play in the 107 days — we just didn’t have enough time,” Harris said. “We didn’t have enough time.”\n\n“Or was it too much time? I mean, if you had done the election after 60 days, I think you win, honestly,” Stewart replied. “There seemed like a stagnation point. And then if you look at the lines …what would have changed?”\n\nThe New York Times’ polling showed Harris’ biggest leads were during the middle of her campaign, followed by a tightening race toward the end.\n\nHarris then acknowledged there were other factors for her loss, particularly blaming so-called “mis- and disinformation.”\n\nOne issue Harris previously claimed was “disinformation” during the campaign was President Donald Trump’s campaign’s ads featuring her advocacy for transgender prisoners to receive sex changes.\n\n“[H]e has spent tens of millions of dollars trying to hit me with a bunch of disinformation and misinformation on this, and he’s living in a glass house because the policies he’s speaking about in terms of those surgeries were also his policies,” Harris claimed. “And the reality of it is that also those ads relate to two people.”\n\nHarris described how she worked “behind the scenes” to give prisoners access to the operations at taxpayer expense during a 2019 press conference.

No, I believe he was fully competent to serve.”\n\nStewart raised his eyebrows and asked, “Do you really?”\n\n“I do,” Harris replied.\n\n“That surprises me, actually,” Stewart said.\n\nHarris argued that Biden was capable of serving another term – even after his disastrous debate performance and on-camera mix-ups. \n\nBut she argued there is a distinction between running for president and being president.\n\n“Being a candidate for president of the United States is about being in a marathon at a sprinter’s pace, having tomatoes thrown at you every step you take,” Harris said.\n\n“And to be the seated president, the sitting president while doing that – it’s a lot.

Fifteen percent each said they were undecided or would not vote.\n\nIt surveyed 1,000 adults from October 16 to October 20, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.47 percentage points.\n\nJohn Cluverius, director of survey research at UMass Lowell, told Newsweek the poll shows that many voters are unfamiliar with these candidates and may not be “really thinking about the 2028 election in a serious way yet.”\n\n“Most of these candidates remain unfamiliar to the national audience,” he said. “That’s especially true when you think about the last four elections, we’ve had very well-known individuals on the ballot every time.”\n\nIn polling from 2022, for instance, surveys showed both former President Biden and President Donald Trump with support above 40 percent, a signal that most voters knew who they were.\n\nThe variation between the two matchups is so small that it is interpreted as a “close race” rather than a real lead, Cluverius said.\n\n“We don’t see a huge difference between those two hypothetical matchups,” he said.\n\nAt this point, no major candidates have entered the 2028 race—both Democrats and Republicans appear to be more focused on the November elections as well as the 2026 midterm, when Democrats are aiming to flip seats across the country. But speculation has already begun about who might run.\n\nNewsom has acknowledged a potential run, but Ocasio-Cortez, who has also been floated as a Senate candidate, has been quieter about her future plans.\n\nNewsom has garnered national attention as he positions himself as a vocal Trump opponent. He has challenged Trump on National Guard deployments to Los Angeles and has worked to pass a ballot measure to counter Republicans’ redistricting efforts in states like Texas.\n\nOcasio-Cortez, first elected to Congress, is a favorite of the party’s more left-leaning wing and is known for taking progressive positions on matters like the Green New Deal and Medicare for All.\n\nOther prominent potential Democratic candidates include former Vice President Kamala Harris and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nAn Echelon Insights poll from earlier in October showed Harris with a lead among Democratic voters. Twenty-four percent said they planned to support her. Newsom followed at 15 percent, while 10 percent said they’d vote for Buttigieg. Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and New Jersey Senator Cory Booker polled at 5 percent. Ocasio-Cortez and Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker polled at 4 percent.\n\nOnly Newsom and Ocasio-Cortez were included in the poll because they were the leading candidates in betting markets to win the party’s nominations, Cluverius said.\n\nOn the Republican side, Vance is viewed as an early frontrunner. His name recognition and proximity to Trump, who remains popular among the conservative base, could give him a boost over other candidates. But he also hasn’t said he intends to run.\n\nHe led other Republicans in the Echelon Insights poll with 46 percent. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis followed with 10 percent, while Secretary of State Marco Rubio and former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley each polled at six percent.\n\nThat poll surveyed 1,010 likely voters from October 16 to October 20 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nNewsom told CNN this week: “People talk about it and you’d b...","summary":"Ocasio-Cortez and Newsom are on track for a close race against Vance if they become their parties&#039; nominees, a new poll found.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/aocs-gavin-newsom-chances-beating-jd-vance-2028-polls-10968172","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2231388676-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 19:56:45","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.245},{"id":374210088,"title":"Trump’s popularity collapses — new poll shows lowest approval rating ever recorded","text":"AP(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nDonald Trump is grappling with his worst approval ratings since returning to the White House. New polling reveals widespread public dissatisfaction with his handling of the economy, jobs, and inflation. Despite mounting criticism, Trump continues to insist that his popularity remains strong and that the economy is thriving.ALSO READ: What does 67 mean, who made the 67 meme and why is it so popular? Why are Donald Trump’s approval ratings hitting new lows? Donald Trump’s approval has plummeted to its lowest point since taking office, as Americans express growing frustration over his economic record. The latest YouGov/Economist survey shows 57 percent of respondents disapprove of his job performance, compared to just 39 percent who approve, a net approval of minus 18 points. This figure marks the lowest of his second term and three points below his worst rating during his first stint in the White House. The findings suggest that Trump’s second term, built on promises of economic resurgence, is falling short in the eyes of voters, as per a report by The Daily Beast and Newsweek.Live Events “The Economist” analyzed the data, noting, “Mr. Trump was re-elected on a wave of economic pessimism, telling voters that ‘incomes will skyrocket, inflation will vanish completely, jobs will come roaring back and the middle class will prosper like never, ever before’ during his second term. So far, they have been disappointed.” How have economic concerns shaped public opinion? Economic frustration appears to be the driving force behind Trump’s declining numbers. When he returned to office in January, Trump enjoyed a net positive approval rating on economic issues, an area typically favorable to Republican presidents. However, nine months into his term, those numbers have reversed sharply. The new data shows he now holds a negative net approval for his handling of the economy (–22 points) and inflation/prices (–32 points). Even his immigration stance, once central to his campaign, now sits underwater at –10 points.ALSO READ: 10 low-effort Halloween costumes that’ll save you time and still turn heads Many Americans cite the effects of his sweeping tariff policies, weak job growth, and surging food prices as key reasons for their discontent. These issues have eroded confidence in his ability to deliver on promises of economic revival and affordability, as per a report by The Daily Beast and Newsweek. Which voter groups are turning away from Donald Trump? Trump’s decline isn’t limited to one demographic, his disapproval crosses gender, race, and age lines. According to the poll: Men: 53 percent disapprove Women: 63 percent disapprove Hispanics: 65 percent disapprove Young voters (18–29): 75 percent disapprove Young Americans, once seen as a potential bright spot for Trump after a stronger-than-expected showing in the 2024 election, are now expressing deep frustration. His net approval rating among Gen Z is just above –50 points, while among Black Americans, it stands around –75 percent — his weakest demographic performance, as per a report by The Daily Beast and Newsweek.ALSO READ: YouTube quietly launches exit program for US workers — is a mass layoff coming? Even groups that have traditionally leaned Republican, such as white and male voters, are showing signs of fatigue. Among white voters, Trump’s net approval has dropped to around zero, while men’s approval sits just below that threshold. How has Trump responded to the backlash? Despite the negative polling, Trump continues to project confidence. During a recent appearance, he dismissed the surveys, insisting his numbers are at an “all-time high.” “I have my highest numbers that I’ve ever had. I ended eight wars, and we have the greatest economy in history,” Trump said. “Energy prices are way down. Everything’s way down. Beef is a little bit high, but we’re going to get beef down too.”ALSO READ: YouTube quietly launches exit program for US workers — is a mass layoff coming? Trump also appeared to acknowledge, for the first time, that food prices have risen sharply under his administration and admitted he cannot seek a third term in office. However, his insistence on painting a rosy picture contrasts sharply with the data. The same poll indicates his overall approval has dropped 1.3 points since last week, underscoring the continuing slide in public support. What role do young voters play in Trump’s decline? Trump’s standing among young voters has deteriorated significantly. In the 2024 presidential election, voters aged 18 to 29 favored Kamala Harris over Trump by 51 percent to 47 percent, a narrower margin than in 2020, but still a clear defeat, as per a report by The Daily Beast and Newsweek. Now, with his approval among Gen Z dipping further, the poll shows only 25 percent of younger respondents approve of his performance, while 67 percent disapprove, a net rating of –42 points. Analysts suggest this erosion of youth support could have lasting implications for his party ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. As the administration faces mounting pressure over economic turbulence, Trump’s challenge will be to rebuild trust in his leadership. His standing among independents and younger voters, both crucial for upcoming election, has weakened considerably. The YouGov/Economist poll, conducted among 1,623 U.S. adults with a 3.4 percent margin of error, paints a sobering picture for a president once seen as politically untouchable. Whether he can reverse this trend may determine not just his legacy, but the political landscape heading into the next election cycle.FAQsWhat is Donald Trump’s current approval rating?According to YouGov/Economist, 57% disapprove of Trump’s performance, while 39% approve.Why is Donald Trump’s approval rating dropping?Rising inflation, economic dissatisfaction, and poor job growth have led to declining public confidence.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTrump’s popularity collapseslowest approval ratingTrump’s lowest approval ratingDonald Trumpapproval ratingyougovTrump approval rating\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Consider the Creator Economy","text":"Did I scare you? Well if I didn’t, the state of Hollywood right now probably will.\n\nThis past week has been a rough one. On Tuesday, Amazon announced it was cutting 14,000 jobs to keep up with this “generation of AI,” layoffs which impacted the company’s video games and publishing divisions. And then there’s Paramount. As part of the company’s new cost-cutting strategy under David Ellison, Paramount will reportedly be laying off 2,000 employees in the coming weeks.\n\nBut as bleak as these axings are, there is one area that’s hiring. Yep, it’s the creator economy.\n\nFrom 2022 to 2024, Los Angeles employment in the motion picture and sound recording industries decreased by 27%, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But during that same time period, workers in the creator economy increased by 5%, and companies in the creator space also increased by 5%. \n\nAs the creator space has gotten bigger, its biggest players have created their own media companies. These businesses are often created with the goal of expanding a creator’s audience and turning their reach and popularity into a more passive and sustainable revenue stream. To make that happen, a lot of these creators have been turning to Hollywood alum. And at the pace some of these creators are moving, they need good experienced people, stat. \n\nTake Sean Atkins, the president and COO of Dhar Mann Studios, who originally came from MTV and Discovery. There’s also Corie Henson, the former head of NBC unscripted TV who moved to Beast Studios. As I’ve spoken to more creators, there seems to be a shift from solely recruiting other digitally-native personnel to bringing in people with more experience in traditional media.\n\nOr as one high-ranking creator exec told me, “They’re looking to add adults to the room.”\n\nThis broadening doesn’t just apply to creator-made companies. There’s also been a boom of companies designed to support creators like Kajabi and Raptive on the tools and strategy side; Night and Digital Brand Architects on the agency side; and QYOU Media on the advertising side. If these companies haven’t already started hiring from film and television pools, they’re at least talking about it. \n\nG&B Digital Management, a creator-focused management company founded by Kyle Hjelmeseth, even hosts workshops to help actors, crew members and creatives in traditional media pivot to the creator economy. The next one is coming to Brooklyn on Nov. 12.\n\nThis isn’t meant to sugarcoat a truly sucky week. Thousands of talented people are getting booted from their jobs. And the ones who are still lucky to be employed are either panicking about their futures (hello Warner Bros. Discovery!) or are spread so thin they can barely breathe. But amid all the horror, there is a small sliver of hope.\n\nNow onto the rest.\n\nSenior Reporterkayla.cobb@thewrap.com\n\nIShowSpeed freaks out over AI deepfakes\n\nMrBeast isn’t the only mega creator panicking over the state of AI. During a livestream last week, IShowSpeed (45 million YouTube subscribers) watched several deepfake videos of himself generated by Sora 2, OpenAI’s latest model. Speed admitted that giving the app permission to use his likeness publicly was a mistake and said, “Whoever told me to make it public, chat, you’re not here for my own safety, bro. I’m f–ked.” So he’s not a fan.\n\nTubi ups its creator bets with Hartbeat and Audiochuck\n\nTubi, the free ad-supported streamer owned by Fox, upped its creator investments in two major ways this week. First up is a deal with Kevin Hart’s Hartbeat for four movies, the streamer’s first exclusive deal for creator content. Two of the upcoming movies will come from Kinigra Deon (5.5 million YouTube subscribers) and 85 South Show (3.4 million Instagram followers).\n\nThat was on Wednesday. On Thursday, Tubi announced a multiyear deal worth $150 million with Audiochuck, the media company from Ashley Flowers that’s behind “Crime Junkie,” “The Deck” and “So Supernatural.” As part of the deal, Tubi will have exclusive distribution and advertising sales rights and will develop a “Crime Junkie” FAST channel. No wonder Tubi got so many shoutouts during this quarter’s earnings call.\n\nNASCAR and Night partner on creator-focused series with TimTheTatman, Emiru and more\n\nNASCAR is tapping creators as part of its effort to expand to younger audiences. The upcoming Creator Series, launched in partnership with the digital talent agency Night, will be hosted by NASCAR analyst Mamba Smith and will see professional driver Carson Hocevar race alongside eight top creators. The creators taking the wheel include: \n\nTimTheTatman (7.6 million Twitch followers) \n\nStableRonaldo (4.3 million Twitch followers)\n\nAgent00 (3.1 million Twitch followers)\n\nRayAsianBoy (2.4 million Twitch followers)\n\nCouRageJD (2.2 million Twitch followers)\n\nYourRAGE (1.9 million Twitch followers)\n\nEmiru (1.9 million Twitch followers) \n\nExtraEmily (875,000 Twitch followers)\n\nThe four-event series will run through October through February and will be available to watch across Twitch, YouTube, TikTok and Instagram.\n\nPlatform Updates\n\nTikTok creators can earn up to 90% of revenue from subscriptions\n\nDuring TikTok’s Creator Summit, the company announced creators can now earn up to 90% of revenue from subscriptions. As the name implies, subscriptions let fans can gain access to paywalled content from TikTok creators. \n\nThe platform also introduced two new AI-powered tools. Smart Split automatically edits longer content into multiple shortform videos. Then there’s AI Outline, which helps creators generate video titles, hashtags, hooks and outlines for their videos. \n\nNetflix is experimenting with vertical videos but swears it’s not competing with TikTok\n\nAt TechCrunch Disrupt 2025, Netflix Chief Technology Officer Elizabeth Stone said the company is starting to experiment with more vertical videos, which is home to shortform content. But Stone promised the company isn’t trying to compete with TikTok or the emerging shortform drama trend.\n\nRemember when Netflix promised it wasn’t going to have ads? Or it wasn’t going to invest in live sports? Or when it swore “Stranger Things” wasn’t coming to theaters earlier this month? So sure, Netflix.\n\nYouTube partners with Adobe, settles Disney lawsuit\n\nIt was a big week for YouTube. As part of Adobe’s new slate of AI toolsfor creators, the company announced a partnership that will add a Create for YouTube Shorts option to the app version of Premiere (I’ve been trying it out, and that platform is seriously awesome). YouTube also announced a series of updates to optimize watching videos in the living room. In the past year, YouTube channels earning six-figure paydays from TV viewership increased by 45%.\n\nYouTube and Disney also settled their ongoing legal feud over Justin Connolly, the former Disney employee who’s now YouTube’s global head of media and sports. Oh, and Alphabet posted its first $100 BILLION quarter.

Phil Murphy.\n\nThe New Jersey gubernatorial election poll published Oct. 28 by Quantus Insights shows Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill leading Republican Jack Ciattarelli by 3 points (49-46%) among likely voters. it carries significant weight given the state’s notable shift to the right in the 2024 presidential election. Sherrill’s lead over Ciattarelli is within the margin of error, making the race far from over.\n\nNew Jersey has historically been a reliable Democratic stronghold. Former President Joe Biden beat President Donald Trump by about 16 points in 2020. However, Trump was just 6 points shy of flipping New Jersey red during his 2024 race against former Vice President Kamala Harris. The dramatic shift in November, coupled with Ciattarelli’s narrow 3-point loss to Murphy in 2021, means the Republican candidate has a strong chance.

Meanwhile, 49 percent of likely New Jersey voters say they plan to cast their ballot in person on Election Day. Among that cohort, Ciattarelli leads Sherrill by 21 points.\n\nDespite Sherrill’s 3-point lead overall, 53 percent of voters believe their neighbors support Ciattarelli. In years past, this typically indicated the possibility that there was understated Republican enthusiasm, sometimes referred to as the shy Trump vote. These voters are less likely to admit to pollsters that they are voting for the Republican candidate, fearing that others might find out, but ultimately choose them when casting their ballots. (ROOKE: Democrats Went All In On Massive Political Gamble That Even CNN Thinks They Are Losing)\n\nThe last time a Republican won a gubernatorial election in New Jersey was in 2013, when Chris Christie was elected. If Ciattarelli is victorious, it could reshape policy on taxes, education, and housing in a high-cost state, while emboldening Republicans nationally in blue-leaning areas, ensuring that Trump’s 2024 red wave wasn’t a one-off election.\n\nFollow Mary Rooke on X: @MaryRooke\n\nSign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!","summary":"What do you think will happen?","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/10/30/new-jersey-red-blue-purple-governor-race-jack-ciattarelli-mikie-sherrill-donald-trump-kamala-harris/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F10%2FGettyImages-1350984893-scaled-e1761847645706.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 18:45:32","author":"Mary Rooke","authors":["Mary Rooke"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":374207250,"title":"Kamala Harris claims Biden ‘didn’t want that debate’ with Trump — and was ‘a little off’ before","text":"WASHINGTON — Former Vice President Kamala Harris claims Joe Biden “didn’t want” to debate Donald Trump and admitted that he had been “a little off” in the lead-up to his career-ending performance — despite vigorously defending the ex-prez in the fallout. \n\nHarris shared her thoughts on the earliest presidential debate in US history that forced Biden, then 81, to drop his re-election bid during a discussion about her new book on the election, “107 Days,” with YouTube host Steven Bartlett on his show “The Diary of a CEO.”\n\n“He called me from debate camp. The president did, Biden did. And I could tell something was a little off,” she recalled of the days before the June 27, 2024, face-off.\n\n“I don’t think he wanted to debate is my point. He didn’t want that debate,” Harris said — even though the 46th president was first to publicly call for the mono-a-mono showdown in a May 15 post on X that year.\n\n“It’s like any competition,” she added. “If it’s sports, you gotta want it, right? If you don’t want to be in the competition, it will absolutely have an impact on your performance. And I don’t think he — I’m pretty sure he did not want to debate. … We had conversations about it.”\n\nHarris, however, never mentioned anything being off when she issued a fiery defense of Biden in a testy interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper in the fallout of the disastrous performance.\n\n“Joe Biden is extraordinarily strong,” she hit back when probed if she thought the then-president should step aside.\n\nBiden dropped out of the race a month later, leading to Harris’ nomination. \n\nIn the disastrous performance, the Democratic incumbent spoke haltingly in a soft voice, mangled his talking points, and even uttered nonsensical remarks such as, “We finally beat Medicare.”\n\n“I watched that debate very closely for many, many reasons,” Harris recounted. “I was in LA at the Fairmont Hotel watching, watching and taking vigorous notes.”\n\nThe former vice president’s sitdown with the podcaster comes after congressional interviews with more than a dozen ex-Biden White House aides and advisers revealed concerns were raised internally about the oldest-ever president’s mental acuity and physical infirmity.\n\n“I do recall the communications team brought forward, led by [Biden senior adviser] Anita [Dunn], the question of whether the President should have a cognitive test when he did his physical,” former White House chief of staff Jeff Zients said in a Sept. 18 transcribed interview with the House Oversight Committee.\n\n“There was discussion of, would doing the test help on this perception [of Biden’s age] issue, would it actually hurt because people would say, ‘Well, that’s a very simple test,’” Zients added.\n\nFormer deputy chief of staff for policy Bruce Reed also told the Oversight Committee that he “heard” Biden’s personal physician Kevin O’Connor — whom Oversight Republicans referred to the DC Board of Medicine for potential loss of his medical license — dismissed cognitive exams as “meaningless.”\n\nAnita Dunn, one of Biden’s senior advisers, also dished to the Oversight panel that it was “decided that no matter how many tests he took, it would never really quiet the people who were attacking him in an election year on these issues.” \n\nNone, however, stated Biden was unfit for office.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Bartlett cited portions of Harris’ 2024 election tell-all in which she ripped members of the Biden White House for also “adding fuel to negative narratives that sprung up about me.”\n\n“The president’s inner circle seemed fine with it. Indeed, it seemed as if they decided I should be knocked down a little bit more,” she writes in the book.\n\n“I was shocked when I read that,” Harris told Bartlett too, “but at the same time, I understood it because it’s human nature, but also shocked because one wouldn’t expect this and it was counterproductive, was absolutely counterproductive.”\n\n“Did he, Joe Biden, know that that was happening?” asked Bartlett.\n\n“I don’t know if he did, but it’s the staff underneath him that are in charge of that,” she responded.\n\n“You’re saying that you think that they wanted you to be weaker in public perception because that kind of keeps you in your place?” Bartlett pressed.\n\n“I think that that was part of it,” Harris replied. “I do, I think that they decided that, you know, there are far too many people in this world and in professional life who approach things with a zero-sum game.”\n\nAsked whether she remains “friends with Joe Biden” and if their relationship is “good,” Harris answered that the former running-mates had “a good relationship” but “it’s very complicated.”\n\n“I have a great deal of affection for him.

The Associated Press previously reported that the administration was considering admitting as few as 7,500 refugees and mostly white South Africans.\n\nThe memo said only that the admission of the 7,500 refugees during 2026 fiscal year was “justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.”\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n Atlanta will stop water cutoffs and evictions to ease shutdown impacts \n\nAtlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said Thursday that because of the SNAP benefit cutoff, the city will stop cutting off water service to people who don’t pay their bills and that city-owned or funded housing will stop evicting people or charging them late fees.\n\nBoth measures will last through Jan. 31.\n\nDickens said the effort is intended to help people who are losing SNAP benefits or federal workers going without pay, but said eligibility would be “pretty open” to anyone requesting help.\n\nThe announcement came as the Atlanta Community Food Bank said it would spend $5 million in reserves to bolster food supplies.\n\nGeorgia’s Republican governor, Brian Kemp, has declined to consider state aid for SNAP recipients, although the state has more than $14 billion in reserve cash. Dickens, a Democrat likely to be reelected on Tuesday, said “this might be a good time” to use some of that surplus.\n\n Another lawsuit challenges suspension of SNAP benefits for tens of millions of Americans \n\nA coalition of cities together with community, business and union organizations filed a lawsuit Thursday that aims to ensure food benefits for tens of millions of low-income Americans don’t get halted this weekend by the Trump administration.\n\nThe lawsuit comes as a federal judge in Boston heard a motion on a similar lawsuit over SNAP, saying she expected to make a ruling later Thursday. The program could be suspended as early as Saturday due to the government shutdown.\n\n“Denying millions of Americans access to basic food security is unlawful and unconscionable, and it threatens to push local nonprofit food banks, food pantries, and other organizations beyond the breaking point,” Diane Yentel, president and CEO, National Council of Nonprofits.\n\nThe SNAP program, which costs about $8 billion per month, serves about 1 in 8 Americans and is a major piece of the nation’s social safety net.\n\n Refugee organizations denounce drastic cuts made in the slashed refugee admittance cap \n\nRefugee advocacy groups are sharing strong reactions to the Trump administration’s new limit on entries from last year’s ceiling of 125,000 set under Democratic President Joe Biden to 7,500, who will mostly be white South Africans.\n\n“By privileging Afrikaners while continuing to ban thousands of refugees who have already been vetted and approved, the administration is once again politicizing a humanitarian program,” Sharif Aly, president of IRAP, said in a statement.\n\n“Concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the program’s purpose as well as its credibility,” said Krish O’Mara Vignarajah, President & CEO of Global Refuge.\n\nHuman Rights First condemned the decision as a “new low point” in U.S. foreign policy.\n\n“This decision will further destabilize front-line states that host over two-thirds of the world’s nearly 43 million refugees, undermining U.S. national security in tandem,” said Uzra Zeya, president of Human Rights First.\n\n Democratic senators say Trump’s ballroom is ‘likely a misuse of federal authority’ \n\nThe top Democrats on three Senate committees are suggesting to Trump that his proposed White House ballroom is “unauthorized, unprecedented” and a “likely misuse of federal authority.”\n\nThe senators raised conflict-of-interest concerns about major government contractors being among the donors contributing to the $300 million project, saying it presented a “profound risk of pay-to-play corruption.”\n\nIn a letter sent to Trump, they request an itemized list of donors, the amounts they gave and if any are foreigner individuals or entities. They also ask for a detailed breakdown of the ballroom plan’s finances, They also ask what steps are being taken to preserve furniture and other historical items previously in the East Wing.\n\nThe letter’s signers were: Sens.

Neighbors said several children were affected and U.S. citizens were among those handcuffed.\n\nThe crackdown that started nearly two months ago has led to tense clashes and roughly 3,000 arrests across Chicago’s metro area, which includes parts of Indiana.\n\nPritzker says Illinois families “deserve to spend Halloween without fear.”\n\nBut Noem says immigration agents are keeping communities safe and blasted Pritzker’s request as “shameful.” She spoke to reporters in Gary, Indiana, after highlighting recent arrests.\n\n UN official blasts Trump’s announcement that US will restart nuclear weapons testing \n\nThe top U.N. official on Thursday blasted President Donald Trump’s announcement that the United States will restart its testing of nuclear weapons.\n\nAntonio Guterres, the U.N. Secretary General, said in a statement that “current nuclear risks are already alarmingly high” for any other countries to join in.\n\n“We must never forget the disastrous legacy of over 2,000 nuclear weapons tests carried out over the last 80 years,” he said, according to his deputy spokesperson, Farhan Haqq. “Nuclear testing can never be permitted under any circumstances.”\n\n Kamala Harris voted for California’s partisan plan to redraw US House maps \n\nThe former vice president said Proposition 50 is California’s chance to fight back against President Donald Trump’s plan to gain more GOP seats in Texas and other states.\n\n“We as Californians are standing up to level the playing field,” Harris said in a social media post.\n\nVoting concludes Nov. 4. If passes, it would realign district boundaries to make as many as five additional seats winnable for Democrats in next year midterm elections. Republicans currently hold nine of the state’s 52 congressional seats.\n\n Warner calls partisan briefing on boat strikes ‘outrageous’ \n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee said that the Trump administration’s gradual efforts to block Democrats from briefings on national security matters is “against every norm of how national security policy has worked” and “an erosion of trust” with the public.\n\nVirginia Sen. Mark Warner said Thursday that a partisan briefing on the U.S. military’s boat strikes in waters off South America this week was “outrageous” and should have never happened.\n\n“Every United States senator ought to read in,” Warner told reporters. “And until that happens, I don’t know how you even begin to rebuild trust.”\n\nWarner criticized Republican senators who attended the meeting, including members of leadership and more moderate members of the GOP conference. He said that “somebody should have walked out.”\n\nThe briefing came as the Senate is expected to vote next week on a war powers resolution that would prohibit strikes in or near Venezuela, unless Congress approves the military action.\n\n Oklahoma agency plans worker furloughs in response to federal shutdown \n\nThe head of the Oklahoma Human Services agency notified employees via email Wednesday that as a result of the federal shutdown they plan to furlough employees who make more than $50,000 annually, effective Nov. 2.\n\nThe agency also plans to implement a hiring freeze for most positions, eliminate most travel and overtime, and reduce or suspend some of its contracts, according to the email from OHS Director Jeffrey Cartmell.\n\n“As you know, nearly 75% of OKDHS’ funding comes from federal sources,” Cartmell wrote in the email obtained by The Associated Press.\n\n“After exhausting every available option to minimize the impact on staff and sustain essential operations, the continuing lapse in federal appropriations leaves us no choice but to implement these temporary measures.”\n\n Last-minute scramble over pay takes a toll on military families during the shutdown \n\nThe government shutdown is exacting a heavy mental toll on the nation’s military families, leaving them not knowing from week to week whether their paychecks will arrive.\n\nAlicia Blevins, whose husband is a Marine, said she’s going to see a therapist in large part because of the grinding uncertainty.\n\n“I don’t feel like I have the tools to deal with this,” said Blevins, 33, who lives at Camp Lejeune, a Marine base near North Carolina’s coast. “I don’t want to dump all this on my husband. He’s got men that he’s in charge of. He’s got enough to deal with.”\n\nEven though the Trump administration has found ways to pay the troops twice since the shutdown began on Oct. 1, the process has been fraught with anxiety for many Americans in uniform and their loved ones. Both times, they were left hanging until the last minute.\n\n Trump administration limits number of refugees to 7,500 and they’re mostly white South Africans \n\nThe Trump administration is restricting the number of refugees it admits into the country to 7,500 and they will mostly be white South Africans, a dramatic drop after the U.S. previously allowed in hundreds of thousands of people fleeing war and persecution from around the world.\n\nThe administration published the news Thursday in a notice on the Federal Register.\n\nNo reason was given for the numbers, which are a dramatic decrease from last year’s ceiling set under the Biden administration of 125,000.

Duffy and Vance will be joined at the roundtable by former New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, and leaders from the aviation industry, according to the official.\n\n— Michelle L. Price\n\n Cuba hawk Rubio says US ready to help Cuban people recover from Hurricane Melissa \n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio says the United States is ready to help the Cuban people recover from devastation wrought by Hurricane Melissa despite long-standing hostility between Washington and Havana, the U.S. emargo on the communist island nation and Rubio’s own harsh criticism of the Cuban government.\n\nIn a statement released Thursday, Rubio said the State Department is issuing “a Declaration of Humanitarian Assistance for Cuba and is prepared to provide immediate humanitarian assistance directly and via local partners who can most effectively deliver it to those in need.”\n\nHe noted that current U.S. law allows for exemptions on exports to Cuba that include private donations of food, medicine, other humanitarian goods to Cuba and disaster response.\n\nOn Wednesday, U.S. officials said several dozen disaster relief workers and urban search and rescue teams are being deployed to Caribbean nations affected by the storm but didn’t mention Cuba.\n\n US sanctions alleged human smuggling network operating out of Mexico \n\nTreasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control imposed sanctions on a Cancun-based human smuggling organization that has allegedly smuggled thousands of people from Europe, the Middle East, South America, and Asia into the U.S.\n\nBhardwaj Human Smuggling Organization and its leader Vikrant Bhardwaj and a group of firms are also accused of being involved in drug trafficking, bribery, and money laundering.\n\nTreasury Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence John K. Hurley said the Trump administration “will continue to target and dismantle terrorist transnational criminal organizations to protect the American people.”\n\n House Speaker Mike Johnson says the shutdown ‘has to end’ \n\nJohnson, a Republican, says it’s no surprise talks are picking up in the Senate on ways to end the government shutdown, particularly with SNAP food aid about to end Saturday.\n\n“We’re just fed up with it,” he said at his daily news conference at the Capitol, on day 30 of the shutdown. “Turn this thing back on.”\n\nThe speaker has kept the House out of legislative session for more than a month, a remarkable closure preventing other business during the shutdown.\n\n US stocks mixed as Wall Street sees both good and bad in Big Tech profits, US-China relations \n\nThe U.S. stock market is drifting around its record heights Thursday, as Wall Street sifts through mixed developments on everything from the U.S.-China trade war to profits for Big Tech behemoths.\n\nThe S&P 500 slipped 0.2% and edged a bit further from its all-time high set Tuesday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 199 points, or 0.5%, as of 10 a.m. Eastern time. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.6% from its record set the day before.\n\nStocks also dipped in Europe, following a mixed finish in Asia, coming off a much anticipated meeting between the leaders of the world’s two largest economies. President Trump hailed his talk with China’s leader, Xi Jinping, as a “12” on a scale of zero to 10, and Trump said he would cut tariffs on China. But while the talks may offer some stability for the near term, major tensions remain between the two countries.\n\n▶ Read more about the financial markets\n\n Trump’s schedule for Thursday \n\nThe president is en route back to Washington and is expected to arrive a little after 3 p.m. ET. This evening, he and first lady Melania Trump will host the annual Halloween parade at the White House.\n\n Xi agreed to buy 25 million metric tons of soybeans annually for next 3 years, Bessent says \n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent added that as part of the deal President Trump struck with Xi, China will start by purchasing 12 million metric tons of soybeans from the U.S. between now and January.\n\n“So you know, our great soybean farmers, who the Chinese used as political pawns, that’s off the table, and they should prosper in the years to come,” Bessent said in an interview on Fox Business Network’s “Mornings with Maria.”\n\n New Trump administration rule bars student loan relief for public workers tied to ‘illegal’ activity \n\nThe Trump administration is forging ahead with plans to eject some nonprofits from a popular student loan forgiveness program if their work is deemed to have a “substantial illegal purpose” — a move that could cut off some teachers, doctors and other public workers from federal loan cancellation.\n\nNew rules finalized Thursday give the Education Department expanded power to ban organizations from the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. The Trump administration calls it necessary to block taxpayer money from lawbreakers. Critics say it turns the program into a tool of political retribution.\n\nSet to take effect in July, the policy is aimed primarily at organizations that work with immigrants and transgender youth.\n\nIt grants the education secretary power to exclude groups from the program if they engage in activities including the trafficking or “chemical castration” of children, illegal immigration and supporting terrorist organizations. “Chemical castration” is defined as using hormone therapy or drugs that delay puberty — gender-affirming care common for transgender children or teens.\n\n▶ Read more about the Trump administration and student loans\n\n Surgeon general nominee goes into labor, delaying confirmation hearing \n\nA Senate hearing for Trump’s surgeon general pick, Casey Means, has been postponed because she went into labor.\n\nThe news from a spokesperson for the Senate health committee comes just hours before Means was scheduled to appear virtually before the committee for her confirmation hearing. It wasn’t immediately clear when the hearing would be rescheduled.\n\nMeans, a Stanford-educated physician-turned-wellness influencer, has been expecting her first child.\n\n Trade takeaways from Trump’s meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping \n\n1. Rolling back tariffs: Trump told reporters while heading home on Air Force One that he had agreed to cut his 20% tariff increase, imposed over China’s role in producing fentanyl and chemicals used to make it, to 10%. China confirmed that it will take average tariffs on Chinese goods to 47%, down from 57%. The two sides agreed to continue to work on cracking down on illicit flows of the drug into the U.S.\n\n2. Sales of computer chips to China: Trump said he discussed U.S. sales of computer chips to China. Trump and former President Joe Biden had imposed restrictions on access to the most advanced chips such as those used for artificial intelligence. China will speak with Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia about purchasing its computer chips, he said. That won’t include its next-generation Blackwell AI chip, he said, “but a lot of the chips.”\n\n3. U.S. soybeans and other farm exports: Trump said the Chinese side has committed to buying “a tremendous amount” of American soybeans, sorghum and other farm products. The Chinese side did not provide any details.\n\n4. No TikTok deal yet: Beijing said it will work with the Trump administration to resolve issues related to TikTok’s ownership.\n\n China and the U.S. to pause tit-for-tat port fee measures for a year \n\nChina’s Commerce Ministry said on Thursday that the U.S. will pause its measures under its Section 301 investigation against China’s shipbuilding and maritime industries for one year. \n\nIt said China will pause its relevant countermeasures against the U.S. for a year in response after the U.S. suspensions take effect.\n\nThe U.S. imposed new port fees on Chinese-owned or -operated ships calling at American ports from Oct. 14 resulting from its Section 301 investigation, which it said found China’s practices in maritime and shipbuilding were “unreasonable” and a burden to American commerce.\n\nBeijing, in response, slapped retaliatory port fees largely mirroring the U.S. fees on American vessels calling at Chinese ports that came into effect the same day.\n\nSeparately, China’s Commerce Ministry also said it will “properly” resolve TikTok related issues with the U.S.\n\n Atomic bombings survivors in Japan denounce Trump's nuclear test comments \n\nJapanese survivors of U.S. atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki at the end World War II condemned Trump’s comments Thursday suggesting the U.S. will restart testing of its nuclear weapons.\n\n“The act vehemently opposes all countries that are endeavoring to achieve a nuclear-free and peaceful world and absolutely could not be tolerated,” said Jiro Hamasumi, secretary general of Nihon Hidankyo, a grassroots organization of the survivors that won the 2024 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe group demanded in a statement that the U.S. respond to calls for nuclear disarmament and take a leadership role in the movement.\n\n China calls on US to refrain from nuclear weapon tests \n\nForeign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said in Beijing that China hopes the U.S. will fulfill its obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty and honor its commitments to suspend nuclear tests.\n\nHis comment came in response to a social media post by Trump that suggested the U.S. might resume the tests. \n\nTrump made the post minutes before the highly anticipated meeting with Chinese leader Xi Jinping in South Korea.\n\n China says it will suspend rare earth controls for one year \n\nChina has agreed to suspend its new export control restrictions on rare earth minerals for one year and study and refine them, the Commerce Ministry said.\n\nIn return, the U.S. will suspend for one year a rule that expanded its controls to all subsidiaries that are at least 50% owned by Chinese companies on an export control list.\n\nThe two moves in the U.S.-China trade war had alarmed companies globally.\n\nThe ministry statement didn’t mention rare earths by name, but said that China would suspend measures announced on Oct. 9, when the rare earth restrictions came out.\n\n Chinese Commerce Ministry confirms tariff reduction \n\nChina confirmed Trump’s comment that the U.S. would slash the fentanyl-related tariff rate by 10 percentage points in a statement from the Commerce Ministry.\n\nIt also said that both sides would extend a temporary tariff rate pause on each other for a year. \n\nThe pause was initially announced in May after both sides threatened each other with sky high rates. \n\n Xi calls for cooperation on AI and immigration \n\nXi, stressing that dialogue is better than confrontation, listed a range of issues where China and the U.S. could work together, including combating illegal immigration and telecom fraud, anti-money laundering efforts, artificial intelligence and infectious disease response.\n\nHe called for more dialogue and exchange on these potential areas of cooperation.\n\nHe also said the U.S. and China should have positive interactions on the global stage that demonstrate their responsibility as major powers to achieve positive results for their countries and the world.\n\nHe noted that China will host the APEC leaders meeting and the U.S., the Group of 20 summit, next year.\n\n Xi calls on both sides to finalize consensus on trade \n\nThe first official Chinese comment on the meeting suggested any deal is not done.\n\nXi noted that negotiating teams from both countries had reached a consensus, a likely reference to talks held in Malaysia last weekend, according to a report on the meeting distributed by state media.\n\nThe Chinese leader said the teams should complete follow-up work as soon as possible to deliver tangible results that will provide “peace of mind” to China, the U.S. and the rest of the world.\n\nThe recent twists and turns in the relationship offer lessons for the U.S. and China, Xi said.\n\n“Both sides should take the long-term perspective into account, focusing on the benefits of cooperation rather than falling into a vicious cycle of mutual retaliation,” he said, according to the report.\n\n China's views on Trump's tariffs \n\nThere was no immediate comment from China on the results of the meeting, but the fentanyl-related tariffs have been a particular sticking point.\n\nChina saw them as an act of bad faith because it had been working with the Biden administration on tightening its controls over the flow of the ingredients for the drug to Mexico. \n\nTrump demanded that China do more.\n\n A look at past Trump-Xi meetings \n\nThursday's meeting between the U.S. and Chinese leaders in Busan, South Korea, ran about an hour and 40 minutes, fairly similar in length to some of their meetings during Trump’s first term.\n\nTheir last meeting six years ago at the Group of 20 summit in Osaka, Japan, was under an hour and a half, as Trump went from his meeting with Xi straight to a separate sit-down with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.\n\nAt a separate G20 summit — this time in 2018 in Buenos Aires, Argentina — Trump and Xi met for a dinner that ran more than two hours.\n\nTheir two meetups in 2017 were more elaborate. First, Trump invited Xi to Mar-a-Lago, his south Florida club and residence, for two days of discussions in April of that year.\n\nXi then returned the favor later that November when he welcomed Trump for a lavish state visit that included an arrival ceremony, a private tour of the Forbidden City as well as a dinner there, a military parade and a state banquet.\n\n Asian markets are lower despite Trump comments on trade with China \n\nTrump’s meeting with Xi appeared to draw an initially skeptical reaction from investors despite Trump’s upbeat comments to reporters afterward. \n\nChinese share prices fell back when markets reopened after their midday break Thursday. \n\nShare prices retreated across the region, with Japan’s benchmark Nikkei 225 down 0.3% and Hong Kong’s Hang Seng sinking 0.7%. \n\nThe Shanghai Composite index lost 0.7%. \n\nU.S. futures and oil prices also declined.\n\n Trump says nuclear testing ‘will be announced’ but doesn’t offer any more details \n\nThe president, while speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, seemed to be conflating the testing of missiles that deliver a nuclear warhead and the testing of nuclear weapons.\n\nTrump said that other countries “seem to all be nuclear testing” but when it comes to the U.S., “We have more nuclear weapons than anybody. We don’t do testing.”\n\nThe U.S. tests its missiles, as does China and Russia. But the U.S. has not done an explosion test on its nuclear warheads since 1992 and no country outside of North Korea has done those tests on their weapons since the 1990s.\n\n“I see them testing and I say, well, if they’re going to test, I guess we have to test,” Trump said.\n\nTrump was asked where the tests would occur and he said, “It’ll be announced. We have test sites.”\n\n Tariffs on Chinese exports are now 47%, Trump says \n\nThe new rate comes from Trump deciding not to move forward with his latest tariff threat, which would have created a 157% levy.\n\nTrump decided to reduce the current rate from 57% to 47% because China agreed to help more on reducing the flow of fentanyl ingredients.\n\n Trump says he’ll work with Xi on Ukraine war \n\n“We’re both going to work together to see if we can get something done,” he said.\n\nHowever, Trump suggested that “there’s not a lot more we can do.”\n\nHe said, “The sides are locked in, fighting, and sometimes you’ve got to let them fight, I guess.”\n\nTrump said they did not discuss China’s purchase of Russian oil, which boosts Moscow’s economy during the conflict.\n\n China and Nvidia will talk about chips, Trump says \n\nThe U.S. president said China will speak with Silicon Valley chipmaker Nvidia about purchasing their computer chips.\n\n“We make great chips,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One. “Nvidia’s the leader.”\n\nIt wouldn’t include the next-generation Blackwell AI chip, “but a lot of the chips,” Trump said.\n\n Trump says he’d return for a Kim Jong Un meeting \n\nThe U.S. president, speaking with reporters after departing South Korea, said he did not connect with the North Korean leader during his Asia trip.\n\nHe stressed that the two leaders maintained a good relationship and said he’d be willing to return for a Kim visit.\n\n“I’d come back with respect to Kim Jong Un,” Trump said.\n\nThe two men met three times during Trump’s first term.\n\n A thaw with Canada? \n\nTrump and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney shared a dinner table last night in Gyeongju, where there were both visiting.\n\n“We had a very nice conversation with him last night,” Trump said.\n\nThe president has been angry at Canada, even increasing tariffs, because of a critical television advertisement about his trade policy.\n\n Trump says Taiwan wasn’t discussed \n\nThere was speculation ahead of the meeting that Xi would push Trump to reduce U.S. support for the self-governing island of Taiwan, which China views as part of its territory. But Trump said they didn’t talk about it.\n\n“Taiwan never came up,” he said.\n\n Trump updates his travel plans \n\nThe president said he would go to China in April, and then Xi would visit the U.S. after that.\n\nIt’s the most specific he’s been about plans for next steps between the two leaders.\n\n Trump says he’s reached deals with Xi \n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump said China would end restrictions on rare earth exports and buy American soybeans. \n\nHe also said the U.S. would reduce tariffs that were implemented earlier this year as punishment for the flow of fentanyl ingredients.\n\nWhen discussing how he would rate the meeting on a scale from 1 to 10, Trump said it would be a 12. \n\n Trump heads back to the U.S. \n\nThe president headed home, wrapping up a trip to Asia that had Trump spending five days in three countries.\n\nHis long flight back to Washington has him scheduled to land Thursday afternoon, where he’s shortly thereafter expected to attend a White House Halloween celebration.\n\n What did Trump and Xi talk about? \n\nBefore the meeting, there was a rough idea of the agenda, including tariffs, computer chips, rare earth minerals and other points of tension. Trump repeatedly said he expected to be able to reach a deal with Xi.\n\nBut there was no immediate word on their conversation once it ended. Trump boarded Air Force One without speaking to reporters, and the White House did not make any announcements.\n\n Trump boards Air Force One \n\nWith the 1 hour and 40 minute meeting with Xi over, Trump boarded the stairs to his plane. He pumped his fist at the top and waved before stepping inside.\n\nThe president is returning to Washington after stops in Malaysia, Japan and South Korea.\n\n Trump and Xi end their meeting \n\nThe two leaders walked out of the building alongside each other, briefly chatting in front of the cameras. They shook hands and Trump leaned in as if he was whispering in Xi’s ear.\n\n Trump-Xi meeting is underway \n\nThe two leaders welcomed the press in for brief introductory remarks but now are talking behind closed doors flanked by their top officials.\n\nJournalists left the meeting room shortly after 11:15 a.m. local time in Busan.\n\nTrump said he and Xi could meet for as long as three hours. The official White House schedule, however, has the meeting running just under two hours.\n\n Xi says US and China should be ‘partners and friends’ despite ‘frictions’ \n\nThe Chinese leader spoke for longer than Trump in his opening remarks, saying “it feels very warm seeing you again because it’s been many years.”\n\n“We do not always see eye to eye with each other,” Xi said through a translator, adding that “it is normal for the two leading economies of the world to have frictions now and then.”\n\nHowever, he said, China and the U.S. “are fully able to help each other succeed and prosper together.”\n\n Trump and Xi convene their bilateral meeting \n\nShortly after their handshake, Trump and Xi moved to a room to hold their talks.\n\n“It’s an honor to be with a friend of mine,” Trump said of Xi. He said the two will be having some discussions, but “I think we’ve already agreed to a lot of things.”\n\nAccompanying Trump were trade representative Jamieson Greer, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, White House chief of staff Susie Wiles and David Perdue, the U.S. ambassador to China.\n\n Trump announces nuclear weapon tests \n\nThere was no indication that the U.S. would start detonating warheads, and the military already regularly tests its missiles and other equipment.\n\nThe president suggested changes were necessary because other countries were testing their weapons. Russia has announced multiple tests recently.\n\nTrump wrote on social media while en route to Busan that the Pentagon will “start testing our Nuclear Weapons on an equal basis” and “that process will begin immediately.”\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to questions seeking more details.","summary":"The Trump administration is restricting the number of refugees it admits into the country to 7,500 and they will mostly be white South Africans","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/xi-jinping-china-joe-biden-scott-bessent-senate-b2855597.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/30/18/South_Korea_China_Trump_Asia_00701.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 18:18:24","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.211},{"id":374185396,"title":"Trump doing 'exactly the opposite' of 'peace through strength': ex-deputy Pentagon press secretary","text":"During the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan's allies often described his hawkish foreign policy as \"peace through strength.\" And the peace-through-strength argument was subsequently used under GOP Presidents George H.W.

So far, the open seat with no obvious successor has drawn the likes of former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former state Assemblyman Ian Calderon, former state Controller Betty Yee, former Orange County Congresswoman Katie Porter, former Fox News commentator Steve Hilton, former state Attorney General Xavior Becerra, state Schools Supt. Tony Thurmond and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco.\n\nWaiting in the wings: Democratic U.S. Sen. Alex Padilla, who surveys indicate would become the favorite if he declares for the office.\n\nFor awhile, the polling leader was former Vice President Kamala Harris, the ex-U.S. Senator who dropped out after months of considering a run. She was the first candidate to self-destruct, when her September book belittled and griped about major national Democratic figures like Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Newsom and even her vice presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\nHarris removed herself from the run for governor, but her book might take her out of the 2028 presidential campaign, too, having established her as a first-rate whiner.\n\nSoon after, Porter – the early leader in most gubernatorial polls – was videotaped snapping at a CBS News reporter who asked tough questions and threatening to end their interview. Another tape quickly emerged revealing her as a screaming boss reaming out an aide. Her behavior forced her to apologize, and will hurt her poll standing.\n\nThese episodes revealed two inept politicos harming themselves, but the episodes cannot match the incompetence demonstrated by current poll leader Hilton.\n\nHis campaign office sent out a press release one day after Newsom in late October shut down the I-5 freeway, the high-speed coastal road for 19 miles between San Onofre and Oceanside.\n\nThe reason was a celebration of the Marine Corps’ upcoming 250th anniversary featuring Vice President JD Vance. It featured live artillery fire over the freeway. Despite assurances from the Marines that there could be no mishaps, Newsom feared firing artillery shells over the freeway might cause accidents and even deaths.\n\nThis drew derision from Hilton the day after the closure. Said Hilton, “(The) I-5 scandal was the final straw. For months, it has been clear that the focus of Gavin Newsom’s attention has been running for president. Instead of an actual governor, California for the last few months has had a social media manager focused on dopey posts …\n\n“This weekend was the final straw…Newsom caused real harm to Californians with his pathetic, divisive stunt: needlessly closing the I-5 so he could blame President Trump for the resulting chaos.”\n\nIn fact, Newsom’s action likely spared Californians a lot of grief. By the time Hilton’s campaign sent his release, Newsom’s worries had been proven valid.\n\nThis became clear after one chunk of shrapnel from an artillery shell fired over the I-5 landed on the hood of a Highway Patrol cruiser parked on an off-ramp and some more hit a police motorcycle in the Vance motorcade. Other shrapnel landed on the freeway.\n\nImagine the havoc had traffic been moving at its usual 75-80 mph pace along the same stretch of 10-lane highway. Consider the traffic jam that might have ensued. Imagine the rear enders and potential injuries averted because the road was closed.\n\nHilton’s office did not respond to requests for an explanation of why the press release went out when it did and has carried on as if nothing happened. No apology, with phone calls and emails not returned. When will rivals start advertising Hilton’s blunder?\n\nIn the end, Hilton’s main gripe about Newsom was proven false. It should be difficult for any candidate to survive this, let alone a California Republican hoping to make next year’s runoff by unifying the GOP vote around himself.\n\nTalk about a season of self-destruction.\n\nEmail Thomas Elias at tdelias@aol.com.","summary":"For California politicians who fancy themselves as the state’s next governor, this fall has become an unprecedented season of self-destruction.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/10/30/this-is-candidate-self-destruction-season/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/OCR-L-GOVPOLL-1025-01.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 18:00:01","author":"Thomas D.

She plays down the historic nature of her campaign for Virginia governor and avoids making big, bold promises about what she will accomplish if elected.\n\nYet some believe the moderate approach — others call it boring — that the former congresswoman and CIA case officer has taken heading into Tuesday’s election holds the key to the Democratic Party’s national revival.\n\n“Don’t promise things you know you can’t deliver,” Spanberger said aboard her bus campaigning this week to be the state’s first female governor. It was a sober warning to Democratic leaders across the country — New York mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani and former President Joe Biden among them.\n\nIt may be an underwhelming message for the millions of angry voters who have flocked to anti-Donald Trump protests in recent weeks demanding that Democratic leaders take bold action to fight the Republican’s norm-busting presidency. But as the Democratic Party searches for an effective message and messengers in the wake of last fall’s Election Day drubbing, Spanberger is offering a pragmatic focus on economic concerns and a toned-down pledge to address Trump’s most damaging policies, when possible.\n\nThat tack is in line with a growing group of Democratic governors, top party operatives and Mikie Sherrill, the New Jersey congresswoman and former Navy helicopter pilot who is the only other Democratic gubernatorial hopeful on the ballot next week. They are betting big that a centrist message aimed at voters’ economic concerns will deliver victory where an intense focus on stopping Trump from unraveling American democracy failed in 2024.\n\nThe Republican nominees in Virginia and New Jersey, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears and Trump-endorsed former business owner and state legislator Jack Ciattarelli, have tried to paint their Democratic opponents as out-of-touch liberals more concerned about transgender rights and immigrants who are in the United States illegally than they are about the safety of school children.\n\nThat playbook worked for Trump in the last presidential election. But given the national security backgrounds of Spanberger and Sherrill, it is unclear whether that will work Tuesday.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who has campaigned alongside Spanberger and Sherrill over the past week, noted that both candidates have focused on rising costs while offering a clear contrast to the chaos that has consumed Trump’s Washington. It’s largely the same approach that Shapiro has taken as he gears up for a 2026 reelection campaign in the swing state before a possible 2028 presidential bid.\n\n“The lesson is winning,” Shapiro said when asked about whether the approach reflects lessons learned from Democrats’ struggles in 2024.\n\nDemocratic divisions loom\n\nThe Democratic Party is far from united on how to move forward.\n\nJust as Spanberger and Sherrill embrace moderation, progressive leaders such as Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have lined up behind Mamdani, who is also on the ballot Tuesday. The self-described democratic socialist has called for government-run grocery stores, free public transit and rent freezes, among other policies that may be difficult to enact if he wins.\n\nMamdani is in an increasingly caustic race with former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is running as an independent after losing the Democratic primary to Mamdani.\n\n“The socialists want to take over the Democratic Party,” Cuomo said in a weekend radio interview. “He wins, book airline tickets for Florida now.”\n\nBut some Democratic voters, even some who came out to hear Spanberger’s message in Virginia this week, say they are excited about Mamdani.\n\nMikal Blount, a 31-year-old commercial window cleaner, joined dozens of voters at a Norfolk restaurant on Sunday to see Spanberger. He said he is impressed by her bipartisan approach and experience in law enforcement, but he also hopes Mamdani wins and emerges as a national star.\n\n“It’s OK to have moderates create common ground and progressives who are down to fight,” he said, expressing frustration with his party’s leaders in Washington. “I’m like what are we doing? We’re not hitting back. MAGA Republicans aren’t holding back, so why are we?” — referring to Trump’s “Make America Great Again” movement.\n\nSpanberger was less enthusiastic about Mamdani’s emergence.\n\nIn an interview, Spanberger said she fears his approach could push people away from the party, but not necessarily because of his most controversial policies, even those she disagrees with. She sees it as a matter of telling the truth.\n\n“We should always, always, always, dream big. It’s not a focus on, just do little things,” she said. “But if he’s making promises that he can’t keep to people who are struggling to put food on the table for their kids or to pay their bus fare to get to their second job of the day, then what’s the long term impact on the people who put their faith in somebody?”\n\nSpanberger offered a similar criticism of Biden’s campaign promises to cancel student debt.\n\n“We wonder why people are like, ‘Oh, I’m tired of voting for the Democrats.’” she said. “If you were to talk to people about canceling debt, a number of people will express some level of, ‘He didn’t do what he said he was going to do.’ Well, he was never going to be able to do that, right?”\n\nA move to the middle\n\nA collection of Democratic operatives released a report this week, “Deciding to Win: Toward a Common Sense Renewal of the Democratic Party,” that effectively endorses Spanberger’s approach.\n\nThe report features input from top advisers to Biden, former President Barack Obama and former Vice President Kamala Harris. It calls on Democratic candidates to reject progressive purity tests and talk less about democracy, climate change and far-left cultural priorities and more about health care, the cost of living and public safety.\n\nVeteran Democratic operative Jesse Ferguson, who provided input, said Spanberger is doing well because she’s “able to connect the pain from Washington to the pockets in Virginia.”\n\n“Trump’s authoritarianism will fail — not because we convince people it’s authoritarian, but because we show them it’s expensive,” Ferguson said.\n\nSpanberger has not attended any of the “No Kings” protests that have featured millions of anti-Trump voters concerned with the threat he poses to U.S. democracy. She rarely said his name on a statewide bus tour this week that took her from Virginia’s affluent suburbs in the north to its military base communities on the Eastern Shore and the Appalachian hills in the rural southwest.\n\n“I feel like if I say it too much, it’s like Beetlejuice. He’s gonna show up,” Spanberger joked.\n\nThis election, she said, is more about the struggles of everyday voters than Trump’s attack on democracy.\n\n“When we win, it’s repudiation of the policies that are harming Virginia, whether it’s the shutdown, DOGE, or tariffs,” Spanberger said. “Like one guy like is single-handedly crushing Virginia soybean farmers, like one guy is single-handedly raising input costs for fertilizer and for farm equipment.”\n\nAnother topic Spanberger does not mention much: the possibility of becoming the first woman elected governor in Virginia.\n\n“I’m delighted that we will have a woman governor. I’m delighted by the fact that when the next generation of candidates step forward, it’s not, ‘Oh, do you think a woman can win?’” she said. “It’s very significant to other people.

The race is a critical test of where the electorate stands ahead of the 2026 midterm elections, when Democrats hope to flip seats across the country, particularly if President Donald Trump’s approval rating continues to decline.\n\nThe party outside of the White House typically performs well in the Virginia gubernatorial race—and polling has shown Spanberger with a lead throughout the campaign, fueling Democratic optimism about their chances here.\n\nBut Republicans believe Earle-Sears’ support could be underestimated in polling. They have also sought to tie Spanberger to the Democrats’ attorney general candidate Jay Jones, who has faced backlash over leaked text messages suggesting political violence against a Republican lawmaker in the state.\n\nWhat To Know\n\nSpanberger’s lead in the race has grown since August, according to a new poll from Roanoke College released on Thursday. The poll gave the Democratic candidate, who has cast herself as a centrist Democrat throughout her political career, a 10-point lead over Earle-Sears, who has aligned herself with President Donald Trump.\n\nFifty-one percent of respondents said they planned to vote for Spanberger, compared to 41 percent who said they would cast their ballots for Earle-Sears.\n\nFormer Representative Abigail Spanberger attends a rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, on October 20, 2025.\n\nThe poll surveyed 1,041 likely voters from October 22 to October 27, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4.05 percentage points.\n\nIt marks a shift toward Spanberger since Roanoke College’s August poll, which gave her a narrower seven-point lead. In that poll, 46 percent of respondents said they would vote for Spanberger, while 39 percent said they would vote for Earle-Sears.\n\nThe survey, conducted from August 11 to August 15, included 702 Virginia residents and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.39 percentage points.\n\nSpanberger is in a more comfortable position than other Democrats on the ticket, according to October’s poll. In the lieutenant governor race, Democrat Ghazala Hasmi leads Republican John Reid by two points (42 percent to 40 percent). In the attorney general race, the incumbent Jason Miyares, a Republican, leads Jones by eight points (46 percent to 38 percent).\n\nIncumbent Governor Glenn Youngkin, a Republican, cannot run again due to term limits. He won in 2021 by fewer than 2 percentage points.\n\nVirginia was once a battleground, but it has shifted toward the Democrats. In 2024, the state backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by a margin of just under six points. In 2020, the state backed former President Joe Biden by about 10 points.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nDr. Harry Wilson, interim director for IPOR and professor emeritus of political science at Roanoke College, wrote in the polling memo: “Like most elections, this one will be determined by voter turnout and how independents vote. While Spanberger appears to have maximized her Democratic support, Earle-Sears could slightly increase her support among Republicans, and she needs to make more inroads with independents with very little time left to do so.”\n\nPollster Nate Silver wrote in an October 28 Substack post on Jones’ scandal: “But so far, the scandal hasn’t moved the needle upballot. Spanberger leads Republican Winsome Earle-Sears by between 8 to 10 points, depending on which polling average you use.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nEarly voting is underway. Election Day is November 4, 2025. Both the Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball classify the race as Likely Democratic.","summary":"Democrat Spanberger leads Republican Earle-Sears in the latest poll of the Virginia gubernatorial race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/abigail-spanberger-expands-lead-over-winsome-earle-sears-poll-virginia-10967604","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2242480837.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 17:33:40","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.33},{"id":374167110,"title":"Shots Fired: Kamala Harris Admits Joe Biden 'Disappointed and Angered Her' Before Suffering Humiliating Election Loss to Donald Trump","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris has admitted there were times when former President Joe Biden \"greatly disappointed\" and \"angered\" her, RadarOnline.com can reveal. \n\nHarris shared a particularly frustrating moment with Biden, 82, after he suspended his reelection campaign and she was tapped to be the Democratic nominee while reflecting on her presidential bid during an appearance on The Diary of a CEO podcast.Harris' 'Good' But 'Complicated' Relationship With Biden RevealedDuring her sit-down chat with host Steven Bartlett, Harris was asked if she was friends with Biden today. \n\nHarris replied, \"Yes,\" before noting, \"It's a good relationship.

And there were times that I've been quite candid about where he greatly disappointed me and frankly, you know, angered me.\"Intense Presidential Debate PrepWhen Bartlett asked Harris to give context on a moment when Biden \"disappointed and angered\" her, the ex-VP quickly recalled a stunning phone conversation they had moments before her debate against then-Republican nominee Donald Trump. \n\nBefore answering, Harris noted how she went back and forth on whether or not to include the tense moment in her post-election memoir, 107 Days. \n\nShe said: \"I thought about this. Was I going to write about it or not? And I decided in writing this book, I was going to just be honest, and these are the facts, and the reader can take what they want from it.\"Harris continued: \"On the day of the debate, my debate with Trump, And you know, so going into a presidential debate is an incredibly intense and intensive project, including what has historically happened that we even called debate camp. \n\n\"Can you imagine? And it's no camp at all. It's going into where you basically are sequestered for a period of time immediately before the debate.\" \n\nThe 61-year-old was interrupted by Bartlett, who passed her a photo taken from \"debate camp\" of one of her campaign team members dressed as Trump for a mock debate. \n\nShe noted: \"He would do the makeup, the orange makeup, the long red tie. He was just awful. Awful. Awful in the best way in trying to get me prepared.\"'Unbelievable' Pre-debate Call From BidenAfter reiterating how \"intense\" debate preparation had been, Harris explained she was getting ready to face Trump when she was told Biden was on the phone and wanted to speak with her. \n\nShe said: \"I'm in the hotel room with Doug, with my husband, and the president calls, and I was told that he wanted to call me so that I'd be ready. And I was so sure it was to buck me up and go get him.\n\n\"And he did say that for the first beat. And then he went on to talk about a group of people in Pennsylvania who were saying bad things about me because they heard I was saying bad things about him. \n\n\"And when I hung up the phone, I was just... it was unbelievable.\"Harris noted: \"I was angry and deeply disappointed. It was so unnecessary.\"\n\nWhen Bartlett remarked he would have interpreted that kind of call as the person not wanting the best for him, Harris agreed before confessing, \"My takeaway is his motivation was all about himself.\" \n\nShe added: \"It wasn't about my performance at the debate.\"","summary":"The former vice president recalled a 'disappointing' phone call she received from the ex-president before she debated Donald Trump.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/kamala-harris-joe-biden-angered-her-before-debate-trump/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/ptSxE92vq/0x0/kamala-harris-joe-biden-disappointed-angered-her-trump-debate-2-1761836595387.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 16:50:00","author":"Haley Gunn","authors":["Haley Gunn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":374169780,"title":"Kamala Harris Reveals the Moment She Noticed 'Something Was a Little Off' with Joe Biden During His 2024 Campaign","text":"Kamala Harris is looking back at President Joe Biden's ill-fated 2024 campaign and sharing a red flag she spotted months before Americans cast their ballots.\n\n The former vice president, 61, appeared on Steven Bartlett's Diary of a CEO podcast on Thursday, Oct. 30, where she reflected on Biden's bid for reelection and her relationship with the former president, 82.\n\n The former vice president zeroed in on one infamous moment from Biden's campaign: his June 2024 debate against President Donald Trump, during which Biden seemed feeble and forgetful, frequently stumbling over his words. Harris revealed to Bartlett that even before the debate, she had a sense something wasn't right with the former president.\n\n \"He called me from debate camp ... and I could tell something was a little off,\" Harris said. \"And I was concerned about— I just, I don't think he wanted to debate, is my point.\"\n\n She continued, \"He didn't want that debate. And you know, it's like any competition you go in, whether it's you're bidding for something, if it's sports, you gotta want it, right? If you don't wanna be in the competition, it will absolutely have an impact on your performance. I'm pretty sure he did not want to debate.\"\n\n When Bartlett asked her how she knew, Harris replied, \"Well, we had conversations about it. I think he got talked into it.\"\n\n Harris said she had been watching the debate that night with a small team in Los Angeles so she could \"be candid\" in her reaction. She knew \"there is no such thing as a perfect debate,\" noting that it's inevitable for candidates to misspeak.\n\n \"There will be something to clean up, and I expected that,\" she said. \"And then, you know, we saw what we all saw.\"\n\n Harris recently published a memoir titled 107 Days, which details the 2024 election and her history-making run for president. While promoting the book in an interview with MSNBC host Rachel Maddow last month, Harris said she was worried it would seem \"self-serving\" of her to advise Biden not to seek reelection.\n\n Maddow asked Harris about a passage in her book alleging that everyone in the Biden administration believed Biden and then-first lady Jill Biden should be the ones to decide if he should run or not.\n\n \"We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,\" Harris wrote. \"Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness.\"\n\n While speaking with Maddow, Harris said she realized, \"I have and had a certain responsibility that I should've followed through on.\"\n\n \"When I talk about the recklessness, as much as anything, I'm talking about myself,\" she added. \"There was so much, as we know, at stake. And as I write, you know, where my head was at, at the time, it would be completely... it would come off as completely self-serving.\"\n\n When Maddow asked Harris if she meant it would've been seen as \"self-serving\" for her to tell Biden not to run again, Harris said, \"Yeah.

She added that \"something was a little off\" prior to the former president's now-infamous debate performance, which ultimately ended his campaign. \"He [Biden] called me from debate camp. The president did, Biden did. And I could tell something was a little off,\" Harris recalled. \"And I was concerned about… I don't think he wanted to debate is my point. He didn't want that debate.\" \"Diary of a CEO\" podcast host Steven Bartlett noted that \"it was so apparently clear\" that something was \"not OK\" with Biden during the 2024 debate, and pressed the former vice president on why \"the Democratic side of politics was pretending everything was okay.\" KAMALA HARRIS CALLED OUT BY REPORTER IN TENSE INTERVIEW FOR 'WORLD-CLASS PIVOT' TO AVOID QUESTION ABOUT BIDEN \"You must have known,\" Bartlett told Harris. While Harris did not directly answer whether she believed Biden was unfit to be on the debate stage, she offered insight into what might have led to the debate going awry for the former president. \"You know, it's like any competition you go in, whether it's you're bidding for something, if it's sports, you got to want it,\" she told Bartlett. \"If you don't want to be in the competition, it will absolutely have an impact on your performance. And I don't think he, I'm pretty sure he did not want to debate.\" Bartlett followed up by asking how Harris knew Biden didn’t want to debate and whether there had been any signs foreshadowing his poor performance. \"Well, we had conversations about it. I think he got talked into it,\" Harris conceded. \"You know, in every debate, I don't care who you are, there will be statistics wrong or, you know, you name this country, but it was that country. That always happens. There is no such thing as a perfect debate. So there will be something to clean up. And I expected that. And then, you know, we saw what we all saw,\" she added. HARRIS LITERALLY THREW 'JOE BIDEN WON' TALKING POINTS ON TABLE AFTER DISASTROUS DEBATE: 'ARE YOU KIDDING ME?' Biden's debate performance against Trump in 2024 was widely viewed as a failure, with the Democratic president tripping over his words, losing his train of thought and speaking in a raspy voice attributed to a cold during the event. This isn’t the first time Harris has discussed her reaction to the debate. In her new political memoir, \"107 Days,\" she wrote that she was stunned by Biden’s response about his administration’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, which left 13 U.S. service members dead. Harris argued that Biden missed an easy question on the military and omitted any acknowledgment of the 13 U.S. service members who died during the Afghanistan withdrawal. She also pointed to his claims that he was \"the only president this century\" and \"this decade\" who did not have any troops \"dying anywhere in the world.\" Another question was also on the military, and included Biden omitting an acknowledgment of the horrific attack that plagued his administration as one of its greatest failures. \"He’s got so much material on this — Trump calling our fallen soldiers 'suckers and losers,'\" Harris wrote of what ran through her head when Biden was asked about his role as commander in chief. KAMALA HARRIS REVEALS WHAT BIDEN TOLD HER JUST BEFORE CRUCIAL DEBATE WITH TRUMP THAT LEFT HER 'ANGRY' \"He managed to get off that line but had stepped on it earlier by saying no one had died in wars overseas on his watch, seeming to forget the thirteen marines who died in the bomb blast at the airport during the evacuation of Afghanistan. I’d been on Air Force Two when it happened, and we had to change our flight plan to get back to D.C. in the face of that tragedy. How could he overlook that day?\" she wrote, expressing her surprise over the response, but misidentifying those who were all killed as members of the Marines Corps.

On Oct. 10, Soon-Shiong began circulating a private placement solicitation asking investors to buy as much as $500 million in private stock.\n\nThe plan then is to take the Los Angeles Times public next fall on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “LAT.”\n\nThe $500 million amount he’s looking to raise is what Soon-Shiong paid for the newspaper in 2018. The glow of a billionaire owner with endless resources faded quickly with his tenure marked by tumult, from waning profitability to layoffs, to a voluntary exodus of talent, to his intervening on editorial decisions like deciding to block an endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential race.\n\nSo when he chose to reveal his plans for an IPO to Jon Stewart as a way to “democratize” the paper, his comments were met with chuckles within media. Now it seems his plans for pre-cursor to his IPO of a private stock sale may be eliciting the same response on Wall Street.\n\nTheWrap could not find one investment banker willing to talk about the offering or the appeal of investing in the Los Angeles Times right now. Others weren’t even aware of the offering. Soon-Shiong hired Digital Offering LLC to assist with the sale, the same firm that Newsmax hired for its public offering in March.\n\n“This seems to me like a way to get suckers to cover part of his exposure while he remains in control. I think the guy is basically clueless about the business and doesn’t know what he doesn’t know, which is always dangerous,” a former senior newspaper executive told TheWrap.\n\nOne Los Angeles media-watcher echoed that bleak assessment. \n\n“Soon-Shiong has been like an absentee landlord at best, and when he has gotten involved with the business, he has caused harm,” Gabriel Kahn, a veteran newspaper journalist and professor at USC’s Annenberg School of Journalism, told TheWrap. “So the question is, what are they selling?” \n\nPatrick’s pitch\n\nThose who do invest in the private stock sale are being promised a 7% annual dividend and a 25% discount for conversion to common stock. Soon-Shiong will still control the voting stock.\n\nThe top-line pitch from Soon-Shiong is this: “Build the most trusted, technology-powered media company of the next century, where diverse voices are amplified, audiences become owners and a 144-year archive fuels innovative formats worldwide. We’ll write the next 144 years, together.”\n\nThe investment is being billed as the LA Times Media Group, which would also include NantStudios and NantGames, virtual production operations whose CEO is Soon-Shiong’s wife, Michele B. Chan.\n\nBut the actual 249-page private placement document is full of CYA language of the risks associated with handing over your money.\n\n To highlight a few of these caveats:\n\n“We will have broad discretion in the use of proceeds from this Offering and may not use them effectively.”\n\n“We currently have limited accounting personnel with a background in public company accounting, reporting and compliance. We will have to add personnel and devote personnel and financial resources to meet our reporting and disclosure obligations as a publicly listed company.”\n\n“Certain recent initial public offerings of companies with relatively small public floats have experienced extreme volatility that may have been unrelated to the underlying performance of the Company. Our Class A Common Stock may experience rapid and substantial price volatility, and price decline, which may make it difficult for prospective investors to assess what we believe to be the value of our Class A Common Stock.”\n\nWhat may be most pertinent to a would-be investor is buried at the very bottom of the document, revenues and profits. For the six months ended on June 29 of this year, it shows a net loss of $21.5 million on revenues of $127.2 million.\n\nShort-term and long-term debt, as of June 29, was $301 million.\n\nA Los Angeles Times spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Gordon McBean, the co-founder and chairman of Laguna Beach-based Digital Offering, did not respond to a request for comment. \n\nThe Times’ trajectory\n\nBack in 2018, USC’s Kahn offered advice in an open letter to Soon-Shiong upon purchasing this journalistic “jewel,” encouraging the paper’s new steward to invest in the Times, stay out of editorial matters and try not to be a player in Washington. “The Times, thank God, is no longer part of a publicly traded company,” Kahn wrote.\n\nNow seven years later, “Soon-Shiong has shown himself to be completely incompetent at running a newspaper,” Kahn said. He described the Times’ subscription business as “anemic,” and faulted the paper for ceding high-impact (and potentially lucrative) coverage of state government in Sacramento to Politico.\n\n“Los Angeles needs a major aggressive, well-funded news organization. There is a market here. It’s a huge area. And it’s not an impossible feat,” Kahn said.\n\n“It’s not that the paper doesn’t do strong journalism,” he added. “But it’s been caught in the familiar cycle of declining revenue means a smaller newsroom budget means more declines in revenue means an even smaller news budget, etc. We’ve seen that movie, we know how it ends.”\n\nThe current day Los Angeles Times is a stark contrast to the one that owner and publisher Otis Chandler, the son of board director and philanthropist Dorothy Chandler, took public in 1964 under the paper’s parent company, Times Mirror, which included other publishing and printing properties. It was a historic move since no major standalone newspaper publisher at that time had turned to the public markets in this way.\n\nRead here for the full offering document.","summary":"As a precursor to a planned IPO, the Forbes-listed billionaire is circulating a private placement offering doc that is laden with the downsides that overshadow much happy talk\n\n\nThe post Patrick Soon-Shiong Wants to Raise $500 Million for the LA Times, but Who Would Invest? | Analysis appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/la-times-patrick-soon-shiong-fundraising-analysis/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/012424-Behind-The-Bloody-Layoffs-at-the-LA-Times-V1.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&quality=89&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 16:15:00","author":"Tom Lowry","authors":["Tom Lowry"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.086},{"id":374151078,"title":"Now New York Times turns on Karine Jean-Pierre as Biden's ex-press secretary destroys her career with disastrous book tour","text":"Karine Jean-Pierre's book tour has garnered a slew of negative attention, and now the New York Times has joined the bandwagon of critics. \n\nJoe Biden's former White House secretary dropped her book 'Independent - A Look Inside a Broken White House, Outside the Party Lines' on October 21, giving the world a glimpse into her time beyond the briefing room and why she left the Democratic Party. \n\nBut a recent and disastrous book tour Q&A with the New Yorker immediately drew criticism toward Jean-Pierre, who, in her new work, revealed she became an independent in June. \n\nDuring the interview, published Monday, journalist Isaac Chotiner stopped Jean-Pierre for clarification several times for her rambling, word-salad responses that failed to explain why she believed Democrats 'betrayed' the former president. \n\nAnd now, the New York Times, a left-leaning outlet, has taken a sharp jab at the first black and openly gay White House press secretary for her jumbled and confusing responses. \n\nThe outlet published an article on Wednesday, titled 'Karine Jean-Pierre and a Book Tour Most Authors Would Not Dream Of,' bashing her for being 'erratic and defensive rather than a forceful champion of her old boss.' \n\nThe article even went as far as to critique her in reference to her former role, seemingly implying she was not good at her job, and it's showing more than ever right now. \n\n'White House press secretaries are supposed to know how to talk to the press. But that has not been evident this week for Karine Jean-Pierre, whose publicity tour for “Independent,” her book about her time behind the briefing room lectern of the Biden White House, has gone viral, and not in a good way,' New York Times journalist Elisabeth Bumiller wrote. \n\nThe outlet almost immediately turned toward Jean-Pierre's interview with Chotiner, stating that Republicans 'termed it embarrassing and incoherent' and also left many 'perplexed.' \n\nWhen questioned why Biden left the 2024 presidential race, she described it as a 'very layered' situation before giving a lengthy answer. \n\n'There’s more to this than just that period of time. This is very layered, right? There’s a period of time that I questioned what was happening and how do we treat our own, how do we treat people who are decent people?\n\n'And then you also have to think about how I’m thinking about this as a Black woman who is part of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, and living in this time where I also don’t think Democrats right now, Democrats’ leadership, is protecting vulnerable people in the way that it should,' she told Chotiner. \n\nThe journalist then replied: 'Sorry, I’m not trying to be dense. I’m a little unclear about what this has to do with Democratic leaders and many Democrats in the country thinking that Joe Biden was going to lose to Donald Trump.' \n\nThe New York Times then highlighted a part of her book when Jean-Pierre said it was an 'insult' to Kamala Harris that people didn't want her to be the Democratic presidential nominee. She also wrote that 'the truth was, I never really believed Harris could win.' \n\nWhen asked about those seemingly contradicting statements by Chotiner, Jean-Pierre told him: 'But two things could be true, right? The thing I say the second time actually proves the thing that I said the first time, right?' \n\nThe article also mentioned how during her time in the White House Jean-Pierre 'often shared the podium with John F. Kirby', a retired Navy admiral who formally worked at the State Department and Pentagon. \n\nHe joined Biden's press secretary at the podium frequently after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023, per the New York Times. \n\n'Mr. Kirby was far more comfortable and better versed in foreign affairs than Ms. Jean-Pierre, who resented the intrusion,' the outlet said. \n\nThe journalist went on to back that up with what she said in her new book. \n\n'In her book, she writes that an unnamed White House official — widely considered to be Anita Dunn — tried to push her aside, and that she wanted an unnamed man who had experience in war-torn regions — presumably Mr. Kirby — to go on a trip to Israel in her place.' \n\nWhen approached by the New York Times for comment, Jean-Pierre's publicists said she was not available for an interview, but went on to issue a statement on her behalf. \n\n'The focus of my book, ‘Independent,’ is to start a conversation about how we move forward as a country, how we preserve our democracy and fix a broken system that if not attended to will lead us into what some are already calling an authoritarian regime,' it read. \n\nChotiner told the outlet he would not speak on the substance of the interview he did with her, but did give insight into their overall interaction. \n\n'It wasn’t a tense interview to conduct. And she seemed very nice,' Chotiner said. \n\nDuring her chat with Chotiner, Jean-Pierre made references to black women 10 times and her LGBTQ status twice.\n\nShe claimed that both Biden and Harris suffered prejudice from voters and within their own parties, saying 'I wish you could walk in my body and live my life' when pressed about her thoughts on Harris' chance to become president.\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Jean-Pierre panned her former party for what she described as poor treatment of 'decent' and 'vulnerable people.' \n\n'And then you also have to think about how I'm thinking about this as a Black woman who is part of the LGBTQ community, and living in this time where I also don't think Democrats right now, Democrats' leadership, is protecting vulnerable people in the way that it should,' she said. \n\nAt another point in the exchange, Jean-Pierre wildly claimed that the subtitle of her book, 'A Look Inside a Broken White House,' had actually been a reference to the Trump administration rather than Biden's.\n\nWhen asked to confirm that she had 'no concern' that Biden could serve a second term, Jean-Pierre maintained that she never witnessed anything from him that would make her think otherwise.\n\n'But you watched TV like the rest of us, right?' Chotiner asked.\n\nJean-Pierre acknowledged the president 'was aging,' but said he was still 'engaged, on top of policy, [and] challenging his staff.'\n\nShe spoke similarly of Biden's declining health in an interview with Gayle King on CBS Mornings last week. \n\nKing, who appeared skeptical of Jean-Pierre stating she didn't see the former president's decline, told her: 'You even write, Karine, that you were on the plane with him going to the debate, and you didn’t see anything.' \n\nKing was referring to Biden's mangled debate with Donald Trump in June 2024 that happened just before he withdrew from the race and passed the baton to Harris. \n\nJean-Pierre then told King she didn't see Biden on the flight, adding: 'With age comes what happens when you get older. \n\n'I never saw anyone who wasn’t there. I saw someone who was always engaged.","summary":"Many have criticized former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre for her disastrous book tour, and now, even the New York Times is not impressed.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15242159/karine-jean-pierre-new-york-times-book-tour-joe-biden.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/30/14/103445515-0-image-m-13_1761833433810.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/05/5385710867894153674/1024x576_MP4_5385710867894153674.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-30 16:03:35","author":"Editor,Emma Richter","authors":["Editor","Emma Richter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.425},{"id":374234438,"title":"Democrat Mikie Sherrill has slight lead in race for New Jersey governor, poll says - USA Today","text":"A new poll finds the New Jersey race for governor could be growing tighter, with Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill edging 4 points ahead of Republican Jack Ciattarelli less than a week before Election Day on Nov. 4.\n\nThe statewide poll from Suffolk University puts Sherrill's support among likely voters at 46%, while Ciattarelli, a former state assemblyman, stands at 42%, though the difference is still within the survey's margins of error. Another 7% of respondents said they were undecided and 3% refused to respond. Two other candidates on the ballot received 1% of support.\n\nDavid Paleologos, Director of the Suffolk University Political Research Center in Boston, said there were enough undecided voters to impact the outcome of the election. “The candidate with the best turnout operation takes the prize, pure and simple,\" he said.\n\nThe poll is only the latest evidence of the race's competitiveness, which has drawn national attention due to the candidates' high spending and the race's potential to illustrate where voters are leaning a year ahead of the consequential 2026 midterm elections. Democrats and Republicans have been fundraising aggressively for their respective candidates, shattering spending records and making it the most expensive race in New Jersey history. In September, spending by candidates and independent expenditure committees exceeded $145 million, according to state filings.\n\nThe statewide poll surveyed 500 likely New Jersey voters by phone from Oct. 26 to 29 and has a margin of error of 4.4 percentage points.\n\nEarly in-person voting in the state began on Oct. 25 and lasts through Nov. 2, before day-of voting on Election Day.\n\nAmong those statewide who have already cast ballots, Sherrill had a 21-point lead over her Republican competitor in the poll, leading 56% to Ciattarelli's 35%.\n\nNew Jersey's current governor, Democrat Phil Murphy, is term-limited after eight years in office. If Sherrill succeeds, it will mark the first time the Democratic Party has held the office for three consecutive terms since the 1960s.\n\nLeading figures from both parties have also weighed in on the closely watched race. Former President Barack Obama threw his support behind Sherrill, and President Donald Trump has endorsed Ciattarelli.\n\nWith such big-name backers, the race is considered a key testing ground for both parties. Though Trump lost the Democratic-leaning state in 2024, he fared better in the Garden State than in his previous two presidential runs, finishing just under 6 points behind Democrat Kamala Harris. It was one of the biggest swings in his direction of any state in the country. Following that performance, a Democratic win in the race for governor could be interpreted as a warning sign for the GOP.\n\nContributing: Susan Page, USA TODAY.\n\nKathryn Palmer is a politics reporter for USA TODAY.

The page, created by an editor who has smeared numerous conservative figures, was added last month to a navigation box about President Donald Trump’s second term that is included on hundreds of articles and connects the term to claimed “persecution” of transgender individuals under Trump.\n\nDuring an interview last Friday for the United Kingdom’s Channel 4 News about his new book The Seven Rules of Trust, Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales was asked about Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk’s claims about a “woke takeover” of the site. Arguing that just reading Wikipedia would disprove the claim, he cited an exchange with someone on social media who asked “What is a woman?” calling it a “gotcha” question. He stated that checking Wikipedia’s article on women shows “woman” defined as “adult human female” (technically, “adult female human”) and this would rebut claims Wikipedia is “crazy, woke left” as critics have alleged.\n\nHad Wales checked the article specifically on the term “adult human female” instead, he would see it described in the introduction as “a slogan adopted by anti-gender and gender-critical (also known as TERF) movements” followed by the claim scholars describe it as “a dog whistle for transphobic beliefs and a form of coded hate speech.” That article also characterizes it as “a trans-exclusionary and gender essentialist statement” limiting women to those “strictly assigned female at birth and cisgender.” Wales would further see the term associated with the claimed “persecution” of transgender people during the second Trump Administration.\n\nThe article was created by editor “Tataral” earlier this year and included in a “hate speech” category, while highlighting Trump using the term in an executive order excluding biological men who call themselves transgender from female prisons and sports. Simultaneously, Tataral fought for alluding to transwomen in the “woman” article’s introduction, but was unsuccessful. An article on Trump’s executive order was also created by Tataral at this time with “adult human female” prominently identified as “anti-trans” and linking to the term’s page, though this mention was later removed. The section regarding Trump’s policies at the “adult human female” page currently contains only one independent source, a British gay magazine, associating the term with his policies.\n\nPreviously, Tataral created the page on Trump’s mugshot taken during the Georgia election investigation, a fact boasted of on the user’s profile page where the editor also admits to being a Trump critic. Aside from efforts to smear Trump, Tataral has been involved in smearing Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk as far-right following his assassination, an act that prompted criticism of Wikipedia from Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT).\n\nTataral also engaged in similar smears of Acting U.S. Attorney Ed Martin following his letter inquiring about bias on Wikipedia earlier this year. Most recently, Tataral was involved in smearing and attempting to delete the article on the Free Press media outlet founded by Bari Weiss, who is known for criticizing transgender activism. That followed her appointment as CBS News editor-in-chief, which prompted some editors to discuss blacklisting the outlet in the future.\n\nSoon after creating the “adult female human” page, Tataral began linking to it from other articles, an encouraged practice on Wikipedia. This included linking to it from the article on gender-critical feminism, which does not consider transwomen to be women, along with the articles on a Trump campaign advertisement criticizing Kamala Harris and the What is a Woman? documentary about transgenderism by conservative commentator Matt Walsh. Later links were added by editor “Usr Trj” to the page about a philosopher critical of transgender activism. Usr Trj previously sought to falsely label the centrist Weiss as “conservative” following her CBS appointment. Another editor added links at articles attacking Norwegian feminist groups opposed to transgenderism.\n\nOn the page for women’s rights activist Kellie-Jay Keen-Minshull, also known as Posie Parker, Tataral added links repeatedly to the “adult human female” page claiming she popularized the term’s usage by critics of transgenderism. Tataral also attempted to link Parker to neo-Nazi groups, but editor “Sweet6970” removed the material from that page and the “adult female human” term’s page. Another editor removed more material from the term’s page due to failing to comply with Wikipedia’s sourcing policies. Material in the page’s introduction claiming scholars call the term “adult female human” a “dogwhistle” and “coded hate speech” was also removed repeatedly for being unsupported by the article’s sources.\n\nProlific left-wing editor “Aquillion” added sourcing and material to support the “dogwhistle” material, but material on “coded hate speech” was removed again as unsupported. Editor “MjolnirPants” subsequently restored the material and initiated a discussion on it. Claiming the term “adult human female” was “very obviously” hate speech, MjolnirPants pointed to several sources. None actually claimed it was hate speech or that scholars considered it hate speech. The material was removed several weeks later for this reason before being restored again, after which editor “Raladic” added numerous sources to support the claim, though these only gave brief singular mentions of the term. An admin subsequently locked the page so only highly-experienced editors could contribute.\n\nWhether “What is a woman?” is a rhetorical question or simply a question with “adult human female” as the desired answer was also a subject of dispute with editors repeatedly fighting over the description. Sweet6970 subsequently opened a discussion about it with various left-wing editors insisting it be described as “rhetorical” in nature. Editor “Void if removed” noted it was more accurate to call it a “gotcha question” as activists intended people to answer it to illustrate their views. An editor arguing for calling it a rhetorical question cited numerous sources, none describing it that way with one only stating it was “almost” a rhetorical question. The article still presents the question as “rhetorical” in nature.\n\nLast month, Tataral expanded the “adult female human” article’s introduction with material connecting it to “persecution of transgender people” in the Trump Administration. Stating this claimed persecution was “aimed at denying their existence, removing transgender rights and protections, and employing dehumanizing language,” the expansion repeatedly linked to a “Persecution of transgender people under the second Trump administration” article created by Tataral. In that article, Trump’s policies were tied to claims of “transgender genocide” and compared to persecution under Nazi Germany.\n\nA couple days after creating the article on “persecution” of transgender people under Trump, Tataral added that page to a navigation box containing various articles concerning Trump’s second term. Later that month, another editor linked the “adult human female” article in the same navigation box, specifically including it in a parenthetical associated with the “persecution” article. Due to this addition, the “adult human female” article is now linked from hundreds of articles using the navigation box, which associates the term with a claimed “persecution” of transgender individuals.\n\nDespite what Wales claims, edits of this nature are emblematic of Wikipedia, particularly regarding LGBT issues. A “code of conduct” imposed by Wikipedia’s owners was invoked by admins supporting the temporary ban of an editor using a person’s username instead of singular “they” pronouns. Another editor was temporarily banned for rejecting “tree” as a pronoun. Earlier this year, a committee enforcing the code of conduct threatened a Polish editor with sanctions over a Bible verse condemning homosexuality in his profile on a Wikipedia-related Discord chat group. Wikipedia’s front page also promoted a gay sex spot earlier this year. Such activity is consistent with the site’s widely-observed left-wing bias.\n\n(Disclosure: The author has been involved in disputes with several of the parties mentioned in the article)\n\nT. D.

It was so unnecessary.”\n\nThe podcast appearance, part of Harris’ media tour promoting her book “107 Days,” marked the former vice president’s latest candid conversation rehashing what happened during her brief and unsuccessful bid for the presidency, as well as the fallout from her loss.\n\nHarris said she is still friends with Biden, who she said had called her two days earlier for her birthday.\n\n“I have a great deal of affection for him, and there were times, that I’ve been quite candid about, where he greatly disappointed me and, frankly, angered me,” she said.\n\nHarris also discussed her perception of Biden’s mental state leading up to his disastrous June 2024 debate against now-President Trump. Harris said in the interview that she didn’t think Biden actually wanted to hold the early general election debate, but was talked into it.\n\n“It’s like any competition you go in, whether it’s you’re bidding for something, if it’s sports – you gotta want it, right?” Harris said. “If you don’t want to be in the competition it will absolutely have an impact on your performance, and I don’t think he – I’m pretty sure he did not want to debate.”\n\nThe former vice president also suggested that she is open to running for president again.\n\n“I think the case for running again is if I can make a difference,” she said. “If I feel that I can offer something as president of the United States that would be not only uplifting to the American people, but would be about getting us on a correct trajectory.”\n\nHarris was asked if she thinks she can offer such a message to the country.\n\n“I mean, that’s why I ran the last time,” she said. “We’ll have to see what happens over the course of these next few months, several months.”\n\nFor more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/kamala-harris-opens-complicated-relationship-141758501.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/YxeY2cnW8bT9l3MIjIuwWg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTE5MjA7aD0xMDgwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cnn_articles_875/2809bba2372c6d93eef73371589e90cd","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-30 14:17:58","author":"Arit John","authors":["Arit John"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.523},{"id":374099200,"title":"‘Not The Question That I Asked You’: Australian Reporter Grills Kamala Harris Like Shrimp On The Barbie","text":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation reporter Sarah Ferguson called out former Vice President Kamala Harris for dodging questions about former President Joe Biden’s declining health during an interview.\n\nHarris has been on a media tour promoting her book, “107 Days,” where she has faced questions about Biden’s health and her defeat in the 2024 presidential election. Ferguson asked Harris if Biden’s denials about his “frailties” hampered her campaign. (RELATED: KJP Wants You To Believe Biden ‘Was Always Engaged’ As President)\n\n“I ran against Donald Trump for president and Donald Trump ran on a platform that was in large part, I believe, misrepresenting his intentions to the American people,” Harris responded. “I do believe that there are a fair number of people that voted for Donald Trump who believed him when he told them that his first priority on day one is going to be to bring down prices, and he didn’t. And you combine that misrepresentation of intention with also what was at play in terms of massive amounts of misinformation and a truncated calendar in terms of the clock.”\n\n“I want to interrupt you because that is a world-class pivot, but it is not the question that I asked you, which is about Joe Biden’s failure to recognize his own frailties and what that did to you,” Ferguson said. “The question is about Joe Biden. Are you still reluctant to criticize the former president?”\n\nAfter some back-and-forth, during which Harris claimed Biden “was not frail as president,” Ferguson pointed to Biden’s poor performance in a June 27, 2024, CNN debate with Trump, during which Biden froze at least twice, lost his train of thought, appeared stiff and made multiple verbal gaffes.\n\n“But he had frailties. We all saw the debate,” Ferguson said, with Harris claiming, “I do believe that Joe Biden had the capacity to be president of the United States, and I’ve never doubted that he had the capacity to be president of the United States. If you want to talk about whether he had the ability to endure what a race for president of the United States would require in that political environment in 2024, as I’ve said in the book, I had concerns.”\n\n“I talked about that in the book. And I also mentioned the context in which that debate occurred. And you’ll probably remember how I talked about that in terms of what his travel schedule had been, that — what he had been enduring in terms of the timing of that debate,” Harris said after Ferguson pressed her about Biden’s decline. “I talk about it extensively in the book. I’m not shying away from that. That’s why I wrote it in the book, because I do know it’s a question people had.”\n\nThe Wall Street Journal published several articles about Biden’s declining mental acuity prior to his July 21, 2024, announcement that he would not seek reelection. Despite multiple sources confirming the reports, these articles faced pushback from other media outlets and Democrats. (RELATED: John Kennedy Tells Hannity When He Suspected Biden Was Declining)\n\nOn Dec. 19, 2024, the Journal revealed that White House aides had “insulated” Biden, even from his Cabinet members, as his health and mental capacity continued to deteriorate.\n\nIn May, Biden announced he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that metastasized to the bone. Prostate cancer that has spread to the bone is usually considered Stage 4B cancer with a survival rate of 37% over five years from diagnosis, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Because you have to park. And you either can’t find parking. Or find it far too expensive. Or you got bamboozled by four competing street parking signs. Or you couldn't leave your space because that dunderhead in the Tesla decided to park within a hair's breadth of your rear bumper. Grrrrrrrr. Today’s Essential California plumbs the vast shallows of your peeves about parking. And doubtless invites more complaints. Which we can dive into another day, if need be. The thing about parking in California is that, by definition, we’re all doing it while running 15 minutes late, after getting caught up in a SigAlert or an inexplicable Caltrans rush-hour lane beautification. We come to the hunt for an open space already frazzled. If it’s street parking we need, too often we find that the space that clearly has Our Name On It has been rendered useless because some bozo chose to park their Range Rover in the middle of TWO spaces. They did this to protect their precious vehicle's paint job. Or to save a space for their lover. Or because they parked without giving a thought to the rest of humankind. AKA, they're human, but they've also ruined everything and now we are left to circle. Reader Denise Wasko Peña denounced the “idiots” who create these “dead spaces” and admonished: “It doesn’t take much\" to park correctly, \"just a little spatial awareness.” Seconded, Ms. Peña, by me and many other readers. Others complained about those vexing parking signs. You know the ones: stacked three or four high, each with various days/hours/conditions in which parking isn't allowed. Wrote Judy Lan: “You miss one detail, you get the ticket right away!” And what about those with the misfortune of living near a hot club or bistro? Valet parking companies “took local street parking, that we paid for with our taxes, and turned it into paid restaurant parking,” complained Michael Antonopolis.. Parking lots solve all these problems, with their clear rules and order, right? Oh heck no! Readers have myriad complaints about both surface lots and garages. Among them: Lots that have waaay too many “compact” spaces, when it seems everyone drives a big, fat SUV. Also aggravating is when said Fat SUVs, or even Mini Coopers, defy the clearly marked boundaries and occupy two spaces. Then there are those handy parking apps that make it sooooo easy to pay for your space. I’ve got four of those parking apps on my phone. Yet it seems each city or private parking lot asks that we sign up the app we don't have. Thanks so much! Another solution to all this festering discontent? Higher-minded readers suggested that the fault lies not in our parking, but in ourselves. They urged more Californians to leave their sacred automobiles in favor of public transportation. Julia Kovisars called for “mandatory, universal pricing” for parking on public streets, to reduce the use of private vehicles and encourage public transit. A woman named Angelia seemed to agree, though she admonished government officials to make communal transportation more ubiquitous and affordable. Said Angelia: “Lack of safe, reliable public transportation and affordable rent close to living-wage jobs seem like the actual obstacles.\" What did I miss?

Discovery to agree to a merger with Paramount, consolidating media with his allies the Ellisons. But states can block that merger.\"\n\nIn July 2025, Paramount agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit from Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nTrump had claimed the interview was deceptively edited to favor Harris and had filed a $20 billion lawsuit, which many legal experts believed was baseless. The $16 million settlement, which did not include an apology from CBS, was directed toward Trump's presidential library.\n\nThe settlement with Trump occurred while Paramount was seeking federal approval for an $8 billion merger with David Ellison's Skydance Media. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC), led by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, approved the merger shortly after the settlement. This led to accusations from critics and Democratic senators that the settlement was a \"bribe\" to ensure regulatory approval.\n\nAs part of the merger, Skydance agreed to make concessions to the Trump administration, including eliminating diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies at CBS and appointing an ombudsman to address claims of bias in news coverage.\n\nDayen reveals that a rumor has emerged that is \"another example of Trump stage-managing the business world,\" in which \"Warner Bros. Discovery — which owns a movie studio, numerous cable networks (CNN, Discovery, TBS, TNT, HGTV, Cartoon Network, TCM), the pay-TV channel HBO, streaming service HBO Max, DC Comics, part of The CW network, part of Fandango, several gaming studios, some theme park in Madrid and much more — has publicly announced that it is for sale. Several companies, including Comcast, Netflix, and Amazon, are sniffing around a purchase, but the one that’s clearly amped to acquire WBD is Paramount, fresh off of being acquired itself by David Ellison’s Skydance Media.\"\n\nAnd while Paramount made three \"unsolicited offers\" for Warner Bros. Discovery, Dayen says, none were accepted.\n\n\"CEO David Zaslav opening up the company for public bidding robs Paramount of its head start,\" Dayen explains, saying that Ellison can try to close the deal by calling \"his friends in the Trump administration to force the issue,\" meaning Trump isn't \"the only one who gets to make the decision.\"\n\nAccording to The New York Post, Trump's plan is that the \"White House would give preferential treatment to Paramount in any sale by making it harder for any other suitor to buy WBD.\"\n\n\"To reinforce this, Makan Delrahim, Trump’s head of the Justice Department Antitrust Division in the first term, has been hired by Paramount to ensure strong administration ties,\" Dayen notes.\n\nVowing to block the sale, Dayen says, is illegal, adding, \"if that matters anymore.\"\n\n\"The Ellison family is a longtime Trump ally; CBS News is being remade in Bari Weiss’s image; Comcast and Netflix at least have angered the president with Saturday Night Live parodies or perceived wokeness; and these grievances are driving the discretionary application of law,\" Dayen writes.\n\n\"The Ellisons, who already have their hands on TikTok, would add CNN to CBS News, building out a right-leaning rival to Fox in old and new media. Doing so through a shotgun wedding with implicit (if not explicit) approvals is just deeply corrupt,\" he adds.\n\nIn a \"normal environment,\" Dayen says, this would violate antitrust laws, not to mention the fact that consolidating studios would cause mass layoffs, price hikes and more.\n\n\"Under the Clayton Act and their interpretation in new merger guidelines written in 2023 by President Biden’s antitrust enforcers, a merger between Paramount and WBD would trigger several structural presumptions of illegality, with respect to both movie studios (the combined company would have more than 30 percent of the market) and televised news,\" Dayen says.\n\nAnd, any state that gets programming from WBD or Paramount — \"in other words, every state — would have jurisdiction to sue,\" he explains.\n\n\"Maybe state enforcers won’t want to prejudge the case, but others have already stepped forward,\" he says, noting that The Writer's Guild of America has said that such a sale would be “a disaster for writers, for consumers and for competition” and said their members would “work with regulators to block the merger.” \n\n\"I doubt that they’re referring to the Trump administration,\" Dayen says. If states don't stand up to Trump, the merger may very well go through.\n\n\"In the absence of a strong stand from state regulators, Trump and Ellison will likely get what they want,\" Dayen says.\n\nGail Slater, the United States Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division, hasn't \"brought a single new merger or monopolization case to trial this year,\" Dayen explains. \"In its bid to squash a judicial proceeding that could blow open the corruption hanging over competition policy, Slater’s Antitrust Division concedes that states can bring their own actions to block mergers anytime they want.\"\n\nDayen says states should pay attention, adding, \"They ought to take her up on it preemptively in the WBD-Paramount case.\"","summary":"In his latest piece in The American Prospect, executive editor David Dayen points out a huge flaw in President Donald Trump's latest quest to remake the media landscape.\n\n\"There’s a problem with Trump’s grand plan,\" Dayen writes. \"He’s not the only one who gets to make the decision.\"\n\nTrump, Dayen explains, is trying to \"force Warner Bros.

It'll be a Putin election. Was it 87% or is it 87.3%? \n\n“That's what Trump wants.\"\n\nNewsom, who has clashed with Trump over the deployment of the National Guard into California, also shredded the incumbent president’s record in office. \n\n\"All the pardoning, all the, this, this great grift -- the biggest, most corrupt administration in history,” Newsom said. “Not just the $400 million plane, but the billion dollars of your tax money, as we're cutting food stamps to pay for the damn plane so he can take that toy home with his foundation when he's 93 or whatever he's done with his fourth or fifth term.\"\n\nThe California Governor is a frontrunner to become the Democratic Party’s nominee for the presidency. He is known for his combative political style, which has led to propose the Election Rigging Response Act. \n\nIf passed, the bill will redraw California's districting lines. Newsom backed the bill after Republicans threatened to gerrymander their own states to increase their hold on Congress.\n\nDuring his conversation with ABC News, he added that a “supine Congress,” “universities selling their souls,” and the “private sector” are allowing Trump’s administration to get away with its controversial policies. \n\n\"I'm afraid we're going to lose our country,” he said. “And where the hell is everybody? Why aren't we standing up to principle?\"\n\nGovernor Newsom has long been thought to be gearing up for a bid to win the Democratic nomination. During his ABC interview, he praised President Joe Biden as \"one of the most successful presidents in the last century,\" but said that he would differ from the former Democratic leader on border policy.\n\nMany immigrants heading to America enter the country via California’s border with Mexico, an issue on which Newsom has called for reform. On Tuesday, he incensed his MAGA nemeses by hiring Michele Beckwith, a U.S. attorney fired by Trump for telling his administration to abide by the constitution on border issues. \n\nA bombshell poll revealed that Newsom is in second place in the race to clinch the Democratic nomination for the presidency. The survey found that 15 percent of participants backed the California governor, while Pete Buttigieg, the former Transportation Secretary, led with 19 percent. \n\nMeanwhile, Kamala Harris, who Trump defeated in the 2024 election, came in at 11 percent. She trailed New York firebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who was backed by 14 percent of the participants. \n\nOn the other side of the political aisle, the poll found that 51 percent of respondents would back J.D. Vance. \n\nNikki Haley, who battled Trump for the Republican nomination in 2024, won just 9 percent of voters' backing in the recent University of New Hampshire poll. \n\nTulsi Gabbard, the controversial Director of National Intelligence, came in third with 8 percent of voters' support.","summary":"Newsom blasted Trump for running the ‘biggest, most corrupt administration in history’ and tore into the president over his record in office","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/gavin-newsom-trump-putin-election-2028-b2855202.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/10/30/10/11/Screenshot-2025-10-30-at-10-56-26.png?crop=2200.5,1467,x37.6,y0&trim=0,92,0,37&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tIDXygoD-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-30 12:25:10","author":"Owen Scott","authors":["Owen Scott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.206},{"id":374098448,"title":"Kamala Harris called out by reporter in tense interview for 'world-class pivot' to avoid question about Biden","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris avoided questions as she was grilled in a recent interview, to the point she was called out by the reporter. Harris has traveled extensively to promote her tell-all book \"107 Days,\" describing her short-lived run for the presidency. Earlier this week, she faced a tense interview with Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s Sarah Ferguson, who pressed her not only about her future political aspirations, but also her record as former President Joe Biden’s running-mate. Biden’s mental acuity and ability to serve were topics that put Biden and his allies in the spotlight, leading many to ask prominent Democrats why they had not spoken out. \"Didn’t you also have a responsibility?\" Ferguson asked on this topic. \"You were one of the people in the room…. Didn't you have a responsibility as an American to step up and say something at that point?\" \"I did not question Joe Biden's capacity to be president at all,\" Harris said firmly in the interview. WASHINGTON POST SLAMS KAMALA HARRIS BOOK TOUR, SAYS DEMS DON'T 'HAVE TIME TO WASTE' ON FORMER VP \"Wasn't his refusal to recognize his own frailties the reason that you faced a nearly impossible task?\" Ferguson asked. Harris appeared to change the subject, replying that she ultimately ran against President Donald Trump, arguing that his platform consisted of misrepresenting his intentions to the American people. \"I want to interrupt you because that is a world-class pivot, but it is not the question that I asked you, which is about Joe Biden's failure to recognize his own frailties and what that did to you,\" Ferguson said. \"The question is about Joe Biden. Are you still reluctant to criticize the former president?\" \"In what regard, please?\" Harris said, telling the reporter to be more specific. Ferguson then asked whether Biden’s failure to recognize his own limitations had put Harris in an impossible position during the election. FROM TELL ALL TO END ALL: FORMER VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS’ 5 BIG CAREER MISTAKES \"He was not frail as president of the United States,\" Harris insisted. \"But he had frailties,\" Ferguson retorted. \"We all saw the debate.\" \"I do believe that Joe Biden had the capacity to be president of the United States and I have never doubted that he had the capacity to be president of the United States,\" Harris claimed. \"If you want to talk about whether he had the ability to endure what a race for president of the United States would require in that political environment in 2024, as I've said in the book, I had concerns.\" Ferguson proceeded to press Harris further, asking whether she is unwilling to criticize Biden on camera as frankly as she did in her book. \"Of course not. I wouldn’t have written the book if I didn’t want to be frank about that,\" Harris replied.

When she told this story on Fox News, she described the encounter as a protest that crossed a line. The stranger had told Miller: “I’m watching you,” she said. This was the day after Charlie Kirk’s assassination. It also wasn’t anything new.\n\nFor weeks before Kirk’s death, activists had been protesting the Millers’ presence in north Arlington, Virginia. Someone had put up wanted posters in their neighborhood with their home address, denouncing Stephen as a Nazi who had committed “crimes against humanity.” A group called Arlington Neighbors United for Humanity warned in an Instagram post: “Your efforts to dismantle our democracy and destroy our social safety net will not be tolerated here.” The local protest became a backdrop to the Trump administration’s response to Kirk’s killing. When Miller, the architect of that response who is known for his inflammatory political rhetoric, announced a legal crackdown on liberal groups, he singled out the tactics that had victimized his family—what he called “organized campaigns of dehumanization, vilification, posting peoples’ addresses.”\n\nStephen Miller soon joined a growing list of senior Trump-administration political appointees—at least six by our count—living in Washington-area military housing, where they are shielded not just from potential violence but also from protest. It is an ominous marker of the nation’s polarization, to which the Trump administration has itself contributed, that some of those top public servants have felt a need to separate themselves from the public. These civilian officials can now depend on the U.S. military to augment their personal security. But so many have made the move that they are now straining the availability of housing for the nation’s top uniformed officers.\n\nKristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary, moved out of her D.C. apartment building and into the home designated for the Coast Guard commandant on Joint Base Anacostia-Bolling, across the river from the capital, after the Daily Mail described where she lived. Both Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth live on “Generals’ Row” at Fort McNair, an Army enclave along the Anacostia River, according to officials from the State and Defense Departments. (Rubio spent one recent evening assembling furniture that had been delivered to the house that day.) Although most Cabinet-level officials live in private houses, there is precedent for senior national-security officials, including the defense secretary, to rent homes on bases for security or convenience. Army Secretary Dan Driscoll, whose family is in Washington only part-time, now shares a home on Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, a picturesque site next to Arlington National Cemetery. His roommate is another senior political appointee to the Army. (When Driscoll moved in, his washing machine wasn’t working, so for the first few weeks of his stay on base, he lugged his laundry over to the home of the Army chief of staff, General Randy George.)\n\nAnother senior White House official, whom The Atlantic is not naming because of security concerns related to a specific foreign threat, also vacated a private home for a military installation after Kirk’s murder. In that case, security officials urged the official to relocate to military housing, according to people briefed on the move, who like many others who spoke with us for this story were not authorized to do so publicly. So many senior officials have requested housing that some are now encountering a familiar D.C. problem: inadequate supply. When Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard’s team inquired earlier in Donald Trump’s second term about her moving onto McNair, it didn’t work out for space reasons, a former official told us.\n\nThere are scattered examples from previous administrations of Cabinet members residing on bases. Both Robert Gates, defense secretary under presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and Jim Mattis, Trump’s first Pentagon chief, lived in Navy housing at the Potomac Hill annex, a secure compound near the State Department. Mike Pompeo, CIA director and secretary of state during Trump’s first term, lived at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. The grand homes they occupied, some of which date back more than a century, offer officials an additional layer of security and ample space for official entertaining.\n\nBut there is no record of so many political appointees living on military installations. The shift adds to the blurring of traditional boundaries between the civilian and military worlds. Trump has made the military a far more visible element of domestic politics, deploying National Guard forces to Washington, Los Angeles, and other cities run by Democrats. He has decreed that those cities should be used as “training grounds” in the battle against the “enemy within.”\n\nAdria Lawrence, an associate professor of international studies and political science at John Hopkins University, told us that housing political advisers on bases sends a problematic message. “In a robust democracy, what you want is the military to be for the defense of the country as a whole and not just one party,” Lawrence told us.\n\nBut the threat assessment has also changed in recent years. Trump has survived two attempted assassinations; Iran has stepped up its efforts to kill federal officials; and political violence—such as the June shooting of two Democratic Minnesota lawmakers, the murder of Kirk in September, and the shooting at a Texas immigration facility two weeks later—is a real danger.\n\nThe result is straining the stock of homes typically allotted to senior uniformed officers on Washington-area bases. Some of those homes, designed for three- and four-star generals, lack sufficient bedrooms for families with young children. Many have lead-abatement issues and require significant repair. The Army notified Congress in January that it planned to spend more than $137,000 on repairs and upgrades to Hegseth’s McNair home before he moved in. Both Hegseth’s predecessor, Lloyd Austin, and Austin’s State Department counterpart, Antony Blinken, faced protesters at their northern-Virginia homes, which were not on bases. Gaza protesters who set up camp outside Blinken’s house, where he lived with his young children, spattered fake blood on cars as they passed by.\n\nRobert Pape, a political-science professor at the University of Chicago, told us that the threat of political violence is real for figures in both major parties. He noted that Trump has revoked the security details for several of his critics and adversaries, including former Vice President Kamala Harris and John Bolton, the former national security adviser from Trump’s first term who has been the target of an Iranian assassination plot. “The correct balance would be: Trump should stop canceling the security detail of former Biden officials,” said Pape, who is also the director of the university’s Chicago Project on Security and Threats. “The issue is both sides are under heightened threat; therefore the threat to both should be taken seriously.”\n\nIn most cases, the civilian officials pay “fair market” rent for their base home, a formula determined by the military. Hegseth, in keeping with a 2008 law that aimed to make Gates’s Navy-owned housing arrangement more affordable, pays a rent equivalent to a general’s housing allowance plus 5 percent (in this case, totaling $4,655.70 a month). The moves, however, can also save the government money. In some cases, base living can reduce the cost of providing personal security to officials, one person familiar with the relocations told us, because protective teams do not need to rent a second location nearby as a staging area.\n\nBase living—in the unofficial Trump Green Zone—has also become something of a double-edged status symbol among Trump officials. No one wants to deal with threats; both the Millers and the unnamed senior official were not looking to leave their homes. But the secure housing does confer upon the recipient a certain sheen of importance that sets them apart from all of the other officials ferried about in armored black SUVs. Administration officials now find themselves vying for the largest houses, not unlike the behind-the-scenes maneuvering that has long played out among senior military officers.\n\nThe isolation of living on a military base, at least for civilians, has also created a deeper division between Trump’s advisers and the metropolitan area where they govern. Trump-administration officials, who regularly mock the nation’s capital as a crime-ridden hellscape, now find themselves in a protected bubble, even farther removed from the city’s daily rhythms. And they are even less likely to encounter a diverse mix of voters—in their neighborhoods, on their playgrounds, in their favorite date-night haunts.\n\nAfter the Kirk assassination, the Trump administration designated antifa a domestic terrorist organization, even though there is no centralized antifa organization, no organizational ties have been established to Kirk’s alleged killer, and the category of domestic terrorist organization has no meaning in federal law. The identities of the activists behind the harassment campaign that helped persuade the Millers to leave their home have not been publicly disclosed.\n\nArlington Neighbors United for Humanity—ANUFH, pronounced, they say, enough—has organized protests near the homes of Miller and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought. Its website calls for “strategic, nonviolent action,” and its efforts appear to have stopped short of making any explicit threats of violence. (A representative of the group declined to comment, as did the Millers.) But the protests were designed to make the Miller family take notice. Stephen Miller has been an architect of Trump’s deportation policy, invoking a centuries-old law to send migrants to a Salvadoran prison and urging immigration-enforcement officers to aggressively find and arrest as many immigrants as possible. He regularly derides Democrats with inflammatory language, calling judicial rulings against the administration a “legal insurrection” and calling the Democratic Party “a domestic extremist organization.”\n\n“Will we let him live in our community in peace while he TERRORIZES children and families? Not a chance,” ANUFH captioned one Instagram post in July that shows a photograph of the Millers and their children. (The Millers have both posted family photos online that show their children’s faces.) Weeks later, the group took credit for covering the sidewalk near the Miller home with chalk messages such as Miller is preying on families, although it said in a post that it had spoken with Stephen Miller’s security beforehand to make sure that the group wasn’t violating any laws. Katie Miller responded with an Instagram post of her own, a video of the chalked words STEPHEN MILLER IS DESTROYING DEMOCRACY! being washed away with a hose. She argued in a subsequent appearance on Fox News that although the protesters may not be violent themselves, they were inciting the kind of violence that killed Kirk. “We will not back down. We will not cower in fear. We will double down. Always, For Charlie,” Katie Miller wrote, echoing her husband’s rhetoric.\n\n“WE ARE PEACEFULLY RESISTING TYRANNY,” ANUFH responded in a post. “GUNS KILL PEOPLE. CHALK SCARES FASCISTS.”\n\nEarlier this month, the Millers put their six-bedroom north Arlington home on the market for $3.75 million. The listing promised “a rare blend of seclusion, sophistication, and striking design.”\n\nNancy A.
