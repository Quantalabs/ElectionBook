Top celebrities including Taylor Swift will be in attendance as rapper Kendrick takes to the stage during half-time.\n\n Meanwhile, Taylor and Brittany Mahomes, wife of quarterback Patrick Mahomes, have been spotted together frequently over the past year, not just at Kansas City Chiefs games but also dining out in NYC. The 35 year old, who's dating Travis Kelce, has been building relationships with the partners of his teammates, including Brittany. \n\nThe pair were first spotted dining together before a Kansas City Chiefs game against the New York Jets, and later seen watching the match from a box at MetLife Stadium.

Swift is attending her second Super Bowl after showing up at last year's big game in Las Vegas to cheer on her boyfriend and Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Many NFL fans have come to be critical of the constant displaying of Swift during broadcasts and on jumbotrons dating back to last season. Her booing by the crowd also coincided with a heavy barrage of boos that welcomed the Chiefs as a team when they ran through the tunnel prior to the game.

But Swift's football roots are with the Eagles, as she grew up an Eagles fan in Pennsylvania. Swift and her father abandoned this fandom when she started dating Kelce last season, so the crowd treated her accordingly in New Orleans. And before Swift was booed relentlessly by the Superdome crowd, that same crowd gave a raucous cheer to President Donald Trump when he was shown on screen prior to the game.

Days after Swift announced her endorsement, Trump sent a post on Truth Social that read \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" The crowd in the Superdome on Sunday seems to be more aligned with Trump on that argument.

Change the bar menus, change the signs, change their reports, change their jargon and insist upon \"American.\"'\n\nWhitworth went on to call on marketing and research firms like Circana and Nielsen to make the change as well, and said, 'I hope other American brewers and wholesalers will join us.'\n\nHe noted that the word 'domestic' is 'not necessarily an incorrect adjective to use,' but it 'just doesn't capture the spirit and passion that's intrinsic to the American beer industry and its brands.'\n\n'It also doesn't fully capture the pride we should all take in products made right here in this great country.'\n\nHe then highlighted the fact that Anheuser-Busch beers are made by 'American hands' and benefit the United States' economy.\n\n'They are brewed by American workers who receive American wages. They rely on American farmers and on American raw material suppliers. They support American causes like the military and first responders. They pay American taxes,' said Whitworth, who served in the Marines before joining the CIA.\n\n'And they exist because of decades of capital investments made in hundreds of local communities right here, across this great country.'\n\nWhitworth also noted that 99 percent of the beers Anheuser-Busch InBev sells in the United States are made within the country, and 99 percent of the ingredients come from American farmers.\n\n'Together, let's leave \"domestic\" in the rear-view mirrors of those good ol' American pickup trucks,' he concluded. \n\n'Let's all take more pride in our American beers.'\n\nAn insider familiar with the terminology change told CNN it was discussed even before President Donald Trump won a decisive victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in November, and is tied to Anheuser-Busch's Super Bowl ad campaign.\n\nSome Budweiser labels already say they are 'great American lager' and are 'brewed and bottled in the USA.'\n\nBut Whitworth's effort comes as the company continues to struggle from the fallout of its ad with Mulvaney.\n\n The decision to hire Mulvaney is estimated to have cost the company more than $1billion in lost sales and knocked it off the number one best selling beer spot in the US.\n\nThe controversy began in April last year when Mulvaney posted on Instagram a photo of a custom can of Bud Light sent to her by the beer to celebrate '365 Days of Girlhood' during her transition to a woman.\n\nShe also posted photos of her opening a can of Bud Light during March Madness in an apparent attempt to broaden the appeal of the beer to LGBTQ customers.\n\nBut the backlash was swift and furious with customers staging a boycott and Kid Rock posting videos online of him shooting cases of Bud Light with a rifle.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev CEO Brendan Whitworth was even forced to issue an apology in the aftermath.\n\n'We never intended to be part of a discussion that divides people,' he said at the time, arguing it is instead focused on 'bringing people together over a beer.'\n\n'My time serving this country taught me the importance of accountability and the values upon which America was founded: freedom, hard work and respect for one another,' he continued. \n\n'As CEO of Anheuser-Busch, I am focused on building and protecting our remarkable history and heritage.\n\n'I care deeply about this country, this company, our brands and our partners. I spend much of my time traveling across America, listening to and learning from our customers, distributors and others. \n\n'Moving forward, I will continue to work tirelessly to bring great beers to consumers across our nation.'\n\nStill, Bud Light sales were down 29.9 percent year over year for the week ending January 20, when compared to the same period last year, according to Fox Business.\n\nFormer Anheuser-Busch President of Operation Anson Frericks attributes the downfall with the company failing to win back its base.\n\n'I think that's one of the most interesting parts about this story is that they lost 30 percent of their customers. Millions of customers, billions of dollars of shareholder value over the last couple of years,' he said Tuesday in an interview on Fox Business' Varney & Co.\n\nFrericks went on to say that Super Bowl ads featuring comedian Shane Gillis and rapper Post Malone 'are actually pretty good.\n\n'But the problem is they've lost a lot of their customers.\n\n'Their customers are asking them, \"Hey what is Bud Light going to be moving forward? Is it gonna be more than Shane Gillis and fun and football, or is it Dylan Mulvaney?\"\n\n'Until the company really comes back and says clearly what Bud Light is going to be, I don't know if any of their loyal customers are going to come back,' he argued.","summary":"Anheuser-Busch CEO Brendan Whitworth announced a subtle packaging change in order to regain its customers following Bud Light's disastrous campaign with Dylan Mulvaney.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14378679/Anheuser-Busch-Bud-Light-domestic-American-Dylan-Mulvaney.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/09/23/95033801-0-image-a-17_1739143452401.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2023/04/03/912420613970965142/1024x576_MP4_912420613970965142.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-09 23:48:53","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.015},{"id":288765498,"title":"Taylor Swift and her A-list squad sport white suits to watch Super Bowl alongside Ice Spice and Este Haim","text":"Taylor Swift strutted into Caesars Superdome with her A-list posse an hour before the Super Bowl as she prepares to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL’s festival of football. \n\nCaesars Superdome rolled out the red carpet for the pop star as she arrived wearing all white at the stadium, flanked by some of her celebrity pals.\n\nIn footage captured by DailyMail.com, Swift was joined by Ice Spice and Este Haim as she strolled through the stadium to get to her suite, where she will watch the Chiefs try to win a third straight Super Bowl.\n\nSwift wore a white suit jacket, blue shorts and thigh-high boots, opting against her usual Chiefs colors for the big game.\n\nThe only red in her outfit came in the form of a small handbag she carried with her into the VIP suite, where she is expected to be joined by plenty more of her friends and family. \n\nFor a second year running the songstress takes center stage on the NFL’s biggest night as she cheers on her tight end beau and the Kansas City Chiefs in the final stage of their quest for an unprecedented Super Bowl three-peat. \n\nKansas City, which enters today with a 19-3 overall record with the songstress in attendance, takes on Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles for a shot at history.\n\nAnd Swift, ever the supportive girlfriend, was once again in the stands to cheer on her boyfriend in what could be the final game of his career. \n\nSwift’s presence inside the stadium was first captured by Fox’s TV cameras an hour before the start of the game, after she dodged paparazzi to sneak inside the perimeter without being spotted. \n\nMeanwhile, there could be an air of tension in Swift’s divided box. The Super Bowl, which is a repeat of the 2023 showdown when Travis defeated brother Jason Kelce and the Eagles, leaves the family and their loyalties split. \n\nKylie Kelce, pregnant with her fourth child, is a die-hard Eagles fan and her husband Jason played for Philadelphia for 13 years before retiring at the end of last season.\n\nJason has said that he wants to see his brother play well on Sunday but ultimately he will be cheering for the Eagles to win, along with his wife.\n\nKylie has said how proud she is of her brother-in-law at making another Super Bowl, even though she wants him to lose. \n\nSwift, meanwhile, once announced that she was an Eagles fan before she had started dating Kelce.\n\nBut she is going to be cheering Kansas City on Sunday evening in a game that could be Kelce’s last ever.\n\nThe 14-time Grammy Award winner has been able to enjoy a calmer buildup to the Super Bowl compared to last year when she completed a mad dash around the world, completing the trip from her Eras Tour shows in Tokyo to Las Vegas to catch Kelce in action in 24 hours. \n\nHowever, her presence in New Orleans caused a stir earlier this week when she stepped out with her Chiefs star boyfriend less than 24 hours before the big game. \n\nThe couple enjoyed a romantic date night at Lilette, a trendy French restaurant on Magazine Street. Word had clearly got out that they were there, with plenty of fans waiting by the steps to film them leaving before sharing the now-viral footage online. \n\nWhile there is no suggestion Kelce has broken any rules by heading out with Swift, his appearance was still a surprise given that it is so close to the game. Some fans on social media even dismissed the footage of them arriving at the restaurant, thinking someone had been mistaken for Kelce. \n\nYet, the ‘Anti-Hero’ hitmaker isn’t the only famous face in the Big Easy this weekend. \n\nPresident Donald Trump is slated to make an appearance at the big game as a special guest of New Orleans Saints owner Gayle Benson. \n\nKelce has faced a barrage of questions about his girlfriend this week, ranging from her cats to his potential plans to propose. But the Chiefs star got the most attention for his words about Trump.\n\nSwift publicly endorsed Kamala Harris before last year’s election, while Kelce never said who he voted for.\n\nWhen asked about Trump being there on Sunday, he said: ‘It’s awesome. It’s a great honor, I think no matter who the President is.\n\n‘I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life and having the President there, it’s the best country in the world so it’s pretty cool.’ \n\nAfter Swift backed Harris, Trump posted on truth social that he ‘hates’ the singer but they appear to be cheering for the same team this weekend.\n\nTrump has twice paid compliments to Patrick Mahomes and on Friday extended his praise to Kelce.\n\nPosting on Truth Social about Sunday’s game, Trump wrote: ‘Two great Quarterbacks in this game. Also, an unbelievable running back, and the absolute best tight end in football (Ever!).’\n\nHowever, with Swift to take up residence in a VIP suite, it is unlikely she will cross paths with the president. \n\nKelce, meanwhile arrived alongside his teammates, for what he has described as the biggest day of his career.\n\nA bombshell report emerged on Saturday night from the NFL claiming that despite Kelce saying he could play for three more years, he is in fact giving serious thought to retirement after Sunday’s game.\n\nNFL Insider Ian Rapoport says Kelce will announce his decision before March 12, which is when free agency begins. \n\nSpeaking earlier this week, Kelce was asked where he sees himself in three years.\n\n‘Hopefully still playing football. I love doing this. I love coming into work every day. I feel like I still got a lot of good football left in me,’ he said on February 3.\n\n‘We’ll see what happens. I know I’ve been setting myself up for other opportunities in my life. That’s always been the goal, knowing that football only lasts for so long.\n\n‘For the most part, I’m planning on being a Kansas City Chief and playing football.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTaylor Swift strutted into Caesars Superdome with her A-list posse an hour&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Taylor Swift and her A-list squad sport white suits to watch Super Bowl alongside Ice Spice and Este Haim first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/taylor-swift-and-her-a-list-squad-sport-white-suits-to-watch-super-bowl-alongside-ice-spice-and-este-haim/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/09/23/95034269-0-image-m-35_1739142124566.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 23:29:47","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.658},{"id":288765486,"title":"Jake Tapper pleads with Trump and Elon Musk to prevent government cuts as his psychologist friend faces termination","text":"CNN anchor Jake Tapper criticized the power Elon Musk has been given in his DOGE position by likening his department’s government cuts to ‘hand-grenades.’\n\nOn CNN’s The Lead on Tuesday, Tapper slammed President Trump’s first two weeks back in power by claiming the administration’s efforts to ‘shrink the federal government’ were being done ‘with very broad strokes and blunt instruments.’ \n\n‘Trump wants to effectively shrink the size of the government and make policy changes? Fine, but how?’ Tapper said. ‘We’re not getting any transparency and there isn’t any accountability.’\n\n‘We don’t know exactly what Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, is doing as he heads DOGE, the new Department of Government Efficiency, tasked with slimming down the size of the government.’ \n\nTapper went on to wonder why Musk was handed access to a payment system that includes ‘your Social Security benefits, your tax refunds and payments to federal workers and contractors having up to more than $5 trillion a year.’ \n\nThe anchor also produced a letter he claimed was that of a friend who worked as a psychologist for the Department of Veteran Affairs. \n\nTapper claimed his friend had received the letter – which urged her to resign – four times in the last two weeks. \n\n‘Her job is making sure that veterans with post-traumatic stress don’t kill themselves, and she is worried,’ he said. \n\n‘What if five percent of people like her leave? How many veterans’ psychologists can we afford to lose? Afford, as in veterans’ lives – not whatever balance sheet the folks at DOGE have.’ \n\nHe then played a clip of Trump answering why it was important for Musk to have access to the payment systems at the Treasury. \n\nTrump replied: ‘Well, he’s got access only to letting people go that he thinks are no good – if we agree with him, and it’s only if we agree with him. He’s a very talented guy from the standpoint of management and costs, and we put him in charge of seeing what he could do with certain groups and certain numbers.’ \n\nTapper ripped into Trump’s answer, wondering if ‘certain groups and certain numbers’ applied to Veteran Affairs psychologists and National Institute of Health cancer researchers. \n\n‘Surely, parts of the federal government could be whittled down. But what we’ve seen so far is an axe being brandished and swung recklessly.’ \n\nThe CNN anchor seemed not to necessarily disagree with the cuts but critiqued the hast with which employees are being slashed. \n\n‘Effective shrinking of government? Effective pardoning? It takes work. Not just hand grenades,’ Tapper concluded. \n\nThe journalist’s criticism comes after another contentious moment on his program when Stephen Miller – Trump’s Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy – seemingly blamed employees supporting Kamala Harris as the reason they lost their job. \n\nMiller appeared on CNN’s The Lead last Tuesday to defend Trump’s recent executive orders – including the pause of foreign aid spending. \n\n‘There’s two million employees in the federal government,’ Miller said before making the shocking claim.\n\n‘Overwhelmingly, the career federal service in this country is far left, left-wing.’\n\nTapper responded that he didn’t know that to be fact.\n\nMiller continued: ‘We looked at USAID as an example, 98 percent either donated to Kamala Harris or another left-wing candidate.’\n\nTapper interjected, asking him: ‘Now you are demonizing an entire workforce’, before Miller shouted him down by saying: ‘Did you just say that saying someone voted for Kamala Harris is demonizing them?\n\n‘You just said I am demonizing someone by saying they voted for Kamala Harris’, Miller continued – before Tapper asked to get the interview back on track.\n\nAfter a brief calm, Miller continued that it was essential for Trump to ‘get a hold of government’ which included people who review spending on grants.\n\nHe added: ‘This might be something like saying, “I want to build a $500-million fountain in the courtyard of the Department of Commerce”.\n\n‘This might be something like saying, “I want to fund gender studies in Afghanistan.” There has to be political control and review.’\n\nDozens of officials at the U.S. Agency for International Development were placed on leave at the beginning of last week. \n\nIn an email obtained by The Washington Post, newly installed acting administrator Jason Gray said: ‘We have identified several actions within USAID that appear to be designed to circumvent the President’s Executive orders and the mandate from the American people.\n\n‘As a result, we have placed a number of USAID employees on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until further notice.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nCNN anchor Jake Tapper criticized the power Elon Musk has been given&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Jake Tapper pleads with Trump and Elon Musk to prevent government cuts as his psychologist friend faces termination first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/jake-tapper-pleads-with-trump-and-elon-musk-to-prevent-government-cuts-as-his-psychologist-friend-faces-termination/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/rewrite-this-title-Jake-Tapper-slams-Musks-power-in-DOGE.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 23:16:53","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.24},{"id":288760586,"title":"Taylor Swift is joined by Ice Spice and Este Haim as she dons white suit to take in Super Bowl with her A-list posse","text":"BREAKING NEWSTaylor Swift is joined by Ice Spice and Este Haim as she dons white suit to take in Super Bowl with her A-list posse\n\nREAD MORE: How Travis Kelce spent the day before the Super Bowl\n\nPODCAST: Trump’s prayer breakfast, Elon causing MAGA mayhem, and the most political Super Bowl yet??\n\nBy ISABEL BALDWIN\n\nPublished: 22:47 GMT, 9 February 2025 | Updated: 23:02 GMT, 9 February 2025\n\nTaylor Swift strutted into Caesars Superdome in New Orleans an hour before the Super Bowl as she prepares to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL's festival of football. \n\nCaesars Superdome rolled out the red carpet for the pop star as she arrived at the stadium with her entourage of A-List pals. \n\nFor a second year running the songstress takes center stage on the NFL's biggest night as she cheers on her tight end beau and the Kansas City Chiefs in the final stage of their quest for an unprecedented Super Bowl three-peat. \n\nKansas City, which enters today with a 19-3 overall record with the songstress in attendance, takes on Jalen Hurts and the Philadelphia Eagles for a shot at history.\n\nAnd Swift, ever the supportive girlfriend, was once again in the stands to cheer on her boyfriend in what could be the final game of his career. \n\nShe was joined by Este Haim for her first appearance on screen.\n\nTaylor Swift wore white for the Super Bowl on Sunday night, and carried a red bag with her\n\nThe 'Fortnight' songstress arrived at Caesar's Superdome to support her boyfriend Kelce \n\nMeanwhile, there could be an air of tension in Swift's divided box. The Super Bowl, which is a repeat of the 2023 showdown when Travis defeated brother Jason Kelce and the Eagles, leaves the family and their loyalties split. \n\nKylie Kelce, pregnant with her fourth child, is a die-hard Eagles fan and her husband Jason played for Philadelphia for 13 years before retiring at the end of last season.\n\nJason has said that he wants to see his brother play well on Sunday but ultimately he will be cheering for the Eagles to win, along with his wife.\n\nKylie has said how proud she is of her brother-in-law at making another Super Bowl, even though she wants him to lose. \n\nSwift, meanwhile, once announced that she was an Eagles fan before she had started dating Kelce.\n\nBut she is going to be cheering Kansas City on Sunday evening in a game that could be Kelce's last ever.\n\nThe 14-time Grammy Award winner has been able to enjoy a calmer buildup to the Super Bowl compared to last year when she completed a mad dash around the world, completing the trip from her Eras Tour shows in Tokyo to Las Vegas to catch Kelce in action in 24 hours. \n\nHowever, her presence in New Orleans caused a stir earlier this week when she stepped out with her Chiefs star boyfriend less than 24 hours before the big game. \n\nTravis' brother Jason Kelce and his wife Kylie Kelce will be cheering for the Eagles \n\nThe pop star was spotted hugging Kylie, who is pregnant with her fourth child, this week \n\nThe couple enjoyed a romantic date night at Lilette, a trendy French restaurant on Magazine Street. Word had clearly got out that they were there, with plenty of fans waiting by the steps to film them leaving before sharing the now-viral footage online. \n\nWhile there is no suggestion Kelce has broken any rules by heading out with Swift, his appearance was still a surprise given that it is so close to the game. Some fans on social media even dismissed the footage of them arriving at the restaurant, thinking someone had been mistaken for Kelce. \n\nYet, the 'Anti-Hero' hitmaker isn't the only famous face in the Big Easy this weekend. \n\nPresident Donald Trump is slated to make an appearance at the big game as a special guest of New Orleans Saints owner Gayle Benson. \n\nKelce has faced a barrage of questions about his girlfriend this week, ranging from her cats to his potential plans to propose. But the Chiefs star got the most attention for his words about Trump.\n\nSwift publicly endorsed Kamala Harris before last year's election, while Kelce never said who he voted for.\n\nWhen asked about Trump being there on Sunday, he said: 'It's awesome. It's a great honor, I think no matter who the President is.\n\nPresident Donald Trump is also headed to New Orleans to soak in the action from the big game \n\n'I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life and having the President there, it's the best country in the world so it's pretty cool.' \n\nAfter Swift backed Harris, Trump posted on truth social that he 'hates' the singer but they appear to be cheering for the same team this weekend.\n\nTrump has twice paid compliments to Patrick Mahomes and on Friday extended his praise to Kelce.\n\nPosting on Truth Social about Sunday's game, Trump wrote: 'Two great Quarterbacks in this game. Also, an unbelievable running back, and the absolute best tight end in football (Ever!).'\n\nHowever, with Swift to take up residence in a VIP suite, it is unlikely she will cross paths with the president. \n\nKelce, meanwhile arrived alongside his teammates, for what he has described as the biggest day of his career.\n\nA bombshell report emerged on Saturday night from the NFL claiming that despite Kelce saying he could play for three more years, he is in fact giving serious thought to retirement after Sunday's game.\n\nNFL Insider Ian Rapoport says Kelce will announce his decision before March 12, which is when free agency begins. \n\nDespite his claims he will play on, a report claimed that Sunday could be Kelce's last game\n\nSpeaking earlier this week, Kelce was asked where he sees himself in three years.\n\n'Hopefully still playing football. I love doing this. I love coming into work every day. I feel like I still got a lot of good football left in me,' he said on February 3.\n\n'We'll see what happens. I know I've been setting myself up for other opportunities in my life. That's always been the goal, knowing that football only lasts for so long.\n\n'For the most part, I'm planning on being a Kansas City Chief and playing football.'\n\nTaylor SwiftDonald TrumpJason Kelce\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTaylor Swift is joined by Ice Spice and Este Haim as she dons white suit to take in Super Bowl with her A-list posse\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Taylor Swift strutted into Caesars Superdome in New Orleans an hour before the Super Bowl as she prepares to cheer on boyfriend Travis Kelce and the Kansas City Chiefs in the NFL's festival of football.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-14378409/Taylor-Swift-opts-against-Chiefs-colors-stuns-white-suit-Super-Bowl-list-posse.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/09/23/95034269-0-image-m-42_1739142136868.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 23:03:42","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.567},{"id":288762394,"title":"Taylor Swift Super Bowl outfit revealed as she's joined by Ice Spice to cheer on Travis Kelce","text":"Pop star Taylor Swift has arrived ready to see if boyfriend Travis Kelce can take home an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl crown in just a few hours time.\n\nKansas City Chiefs tight end Travis - who donned a unique pre-game outfit earlier - and his team are seeking their fourth Super Bowl victory in six years this evening when they face the Philadelphia Eagles, a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years ago when the Chiefs rallied for a 38-35 win.\n\n Taylor, who watched the Chiefs' victory alongside Ice Spice and Blake Lively last year, is rumoured to be possibly making more than just an appearance in the stands during tonight's game at Caesars Superdome in New Orleans, Louisiana. \n\nIn footage taken of Taylor arriving ready for the game, the pop megastar can be seen donning white thigh-high boots and an oversized white blazer with a small red bag as an accessory. \"A light suit? We triumphed,\" one Swiftie commented on Twitter (X), with another adding: \"A WHITE SUITE?? WE WON.\"\n\nKendrick Lamar is providing the entertainment for this year's Super Bowl halftime show, with many convinced the Not Like Us rapper will bring Taylor on stage with him at some point. The Grammy Award winning rapper, 37, and Taylor collaborated in 2015 for the remix of the Shake It Off singer's song Bad Blood. \n\nTaylor's boyfriend Travis caused some controversary earlier this week when he said it will be a \"great honour\" to play in front of US President Donald Trump in tonight’s Super Bowl. Trump, who declared \"I hate Taylor Swift\" after the singer endorsed his rival Kamala Harris during last year’s election, is due to become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl later this evening. \n\n\"That’s awesome, it’s a great honour,\" Travis said when asked how he feels about Trump being in the stands ahead of the game. \"No matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life. Having the president there, it’s the best country in the world and that’s pretty cool.\"\n\nTaylor and Trump clashed during the presidential election with Swift endorsing Harris, prompting Trump to post on his social media platform Truth that he \"hated\" the singer. Trump later added that he liked Kelce \"even though he may be a liberal and probably can’t stand me!\"\n\nTrump has also praised Travis' team-mate, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who likewise welcomed the announcement that Trump will be in New Orleans. \"I didn’t see that clip but obviously it’s cool to hear that he’s seen me play football and respects the game that I play,\" Patrick said. \"It’s always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president, someone in the top position in our country.\"\n\nLike this story?

Jackson being a common occurrence for the president.\n\nHowever, he has stoked the fires of one particular feud more than any other, causing an army of fans to hit back at his comments. Trump's feelings toward Taylor Swift have changed significantly since her astronomical rise to fame and his entry into politics.\n\nThe 78-year-old is set to arrive at the Super Bowl on Sunday, marking the first time a sitting president has attended the big game. Taylor will also be in attendance to watch her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, who will take on the Philadelphia Eagles with his team, the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nWhen asked how he felt about the president's upcoming appearance, Travis remained diplomatic and shared his excitement about the event.\n\n\"That's awesome. It's a great honor,\" he said at a press conference. \"I think, you know, no matter who the president is, I know I'm excited because it's the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there, it's the best country in the world. So, that'd be pretty cool.\"\n\nWhile Trump seems to like the NFL tight end, he is certainly not a fan of the pop megastar. Join HELLO! as we look back at everything Trump has said about Taylor ahead of the event.\n\nTrump's Swiftie status\n\nBefore the \"Cruel Summer\" singer began to speak out about politics, the father of five was seemingly a Swiftie, like the rest of the world. \"@taylorswift13 Thanks for the beautiful picture — you are fantastic!\" he tweeted in August 2012. While it is unclear what picture he is referring to, Trump was firmly on board with the star.\n\nAfter Taylor's 2012 breakup with Connor Kennedy, Trump weighed in. \"Re: Taylor and Conor — great news for Taylor!\" he tweeted.\n\nIn October of that year, he couldn't have been happier for her after she was announced as a co-host of the Grammy nominations special. \"Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12.5,\" he tweeted. \"Taylor is terrific!\"\n\nTaylor gets political\n\nTrump's appreciation of Taylor quickly soured in 2018, after she spoke out in support of the Tennessee Democratic candidate Phil Bredesen and said that the Republican representative Marsha Blackburn's voting record was \"appalling\" ahead of the midterm elections. \n\n\"In the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now,\" she shared. \"I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.\"\n\n\"I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love,\" she added.\n\nAware of Taylor's incredible influence, Trump was unhappy with this comment and told White House reporters, \"Let's just say I like Taylor's music about 25% less now, okay?\" \n\nA souring relationship\n\nThe president's comments on the 35-year-old have grown more frequent since 2023, when he began gearing up for his election campaign.\n\nAfter Taylor and Travis went public with their romance in September of that year, Trump was quick to weigh in on the lovebirds. \"I wish the best for both of them,\" he told the Daily Caller. \"I hope they enjoy their life, maybe together, maybe not — most likely not.\"\n\nJust two months later, he claimed that the song he recorded with several of the January 6 insurrectionists had beaten Taylor on the charts. \"When that came out, it went to the number one song, it was beating everybody,\" he said at a Houston rally. \"It beat Taylor Swift, it beat Miley Cyrus, who was number one and two,\" he continued. \"They were number one and two, we knocked them off for a long time.\"\n\nIn February 2024, he speculated that the blonde bombshell would not be casting her vote for Joe Biden in the election race, and slipped in a comment about her NFL star boyfriend.\n\n\"I signed and was responsible for the Music Modernization Act for Taylor Swift and all other Musical Artists,\" he said on Truth Social. \"Joe Biden didn't do anything for Taylor, and never will. There's no way she could endorse Crooked Joe Biden, the worst and most corrupt President in the History of our Country, and be disloyal to the man who made her so much money.\"\n\n\"Besides that, I like her boyfriend, Travis, even though he may be a Liberal, and probably can't stand me!\" he added. Trump broke from his usual disdain for the singer when speaking to Variety in June, calling her \"very beautiful\".\n\n\"I think she's liberal,\" he said. \"She probably doesn't like Trump. I hear she's very talented. I think she's very beautiful, actually — unusually beautiful!\"\n\n\"She's legitimately liberal? It's not an act?\" he added. \"It surprises me that a country star can be successful being liberal.\"\n\nThe 78-year-old landed in hot water after he shared a fake image of Taylor fans wearing \"Swifties for Trump\" shirts, followed by the \"Bad Blood\" singer herself wearing a hat that read, \"Taylor Wants You to Vote For Donald Trump\".\n\n\"I accept!\" he wrote. Trump quickly backtracked on the move when speaking to The Evening Edit, saying that he didn't generate the AI images. \"Somebody came out. They said, oh, look at this,\" he commented. \"These were all made up by other people. A.I. is always very dangerous in that way.\"\n\nThe nail in the coffin\n\nTaylor broke the internet in September after endorsing former Vice President Kamala Harris in the election race; Trump, of course, did not take this lightly.\n\n\"I was not a Taylor Swift fan. It was just a question of time…She's a very liberal person, she seems to always endorse a Democrat and she'll probably pay a price for it in the marketplace,\" he said on Fox & Friends.\n\nHe then proceeded to share his thoughts on her close friend and wife of Patrick Mahomes, Travis' teammate. \"I like Brittany, I think Brittany's great,\" he said. \"Brittany got a lot of news last week, she's a big MAGA fan. That's the one I like much better than Taylor Swift.\"\n\nTrump seemed to have reached the end of his tether just days later, simply writing, \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" on Truth Social.","summary":"Donald Trump's feelings toward Taylor Swift have changed significantly since her astronomical rise to fame and his entry into politics.

Abrupt cut raises questions","text":"When “60 Minutes” edited an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was the Democratic presidential candidate, Donald Trump, mainstream Republicans and MAGA followers howled, demanding to see a transcript, which was recently released by the FCC and CBS.\n\nTrump has sued CBS, and this past week, he amended his lawsuit, demanding $20 billion while claiming the network deceptively edited the interview in an effort to prop up her election chances.\n\nOn Sunday, during Trump’s interview with Fox News anchor Bret Baier, there’s an apparent edit that comes after Baier asks Trump how he will bring the country together. Media members are asking for a transcript.\n\n“Just because interview editing is now a big thing,” Bulwark editor and MSNBC contributor Sam Stein tweeted. “You can tell there is an edit cut here at 11 seconds in. Don’t know what was left out. Is there a right to see the full transcript? Is this now an FCC matter?”\n\nHere’s the edit Stein mentioned:\n\nDuring the interview, which aired Sunday during the Super Bowl preshow, Trump said he is serious about wanting Canada to become the 51st state.\n\n“Yeah it is,” Trump told Baier when asked whether his talk of annexing Canada is “a real thing” — as Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau recently suggested.\n\n“I think Canada would be much better off being the 51st state because we lose $200 billion a year with Canada. And I’m not going to let that happen,” he said. “Why are we paying $200 billion a year, essentially a subsidy to Canada?”\n\nThe U.S. is not subsidizing Canada. The U.S. buys products from the natural resource-rich nation, including commodities like oil. While the trade gap in goods has ballooned in recent years to $72 billion in 2023, the deficit largely reflects America’s imports of Canadian energy.\n\nTrump has repeatedly suggested that Canada would be better off if it agreed to become the 51st U.S. state — a prospect that is deeply unpopular among Canadians.\n\nTrudeau said Friday during a closed-door session with business and labor leaders that Trump’s talk of making Canada the 51st U.S. state is “a real thing” and is linked to his desire for access to the country’s natural resources.\n\n“Mr. Trump has it in mind that the easiest way to do it is absorbing our country and it is a real thing. In my conversations with him on,” Trudeau said, according to CBC, Canada’s public broadcaster. “They’re very aware of our resources of what we have and they very much want to be able to benefit from those.”\n\nIn the interview, which was pre-taped this weekend in Florida, Trump also said that he has not seen enough action from Canada and Mexico to stave off the tariffs he has threatened to impose on the country’s two largest trading partners.\n\n“No, it’s not good enough,” he said. “Something has to happen. It’s not sustainable. And I’m changing it.”\n\nTrump last week agreed to a 30-day pause on his plan to slap Mexico and Canada with a 25% tariff on all imports except for Canadian oil, natural gas and electricity, which would be taxed at 10%, after the countries took steps to appease his concerns about border security and drug trafficking.\n\nWhile traveling Sunday on Air Force One to the championship game in New Orleans, Trump said that he would on Monday announce a 25% tariffs on all steel and aluminum imports into the U.S., including from Canada and Mexico and a plan for reciprocal tariffs later in the week.\n\n“Very simply it’s if they charge us, we charge them,” he said.\n\nTrump’s participation in the interview marked a return to tradition. Presidents have typically granted a sit-down to the network broadcasting the Super Bowl game, the most-watched television event of the year. But both Trump and his predecessor, Joe Biden, were inconsistent in their participation.\n\nBiden declined to participate last year and in 2023, when efforts by his team to have Biden speak with a Fox Corp. streaming service instead of the main network failed. During his first term, Trump participated in three out of four years.\n\nTrump on Sunday will also become the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl in person — something he told Baier he was surprised to learn.\n\n“I thought it would be a good thing for the country to have the president at the game,” he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"The president chatted with Fox News anchor Bret Baier before Super Bowl LIX","url":"https://www.nj.com/news/2025/02/was-trump-super-bowl-interview-with-fox-news-edited-abrupt-cut-raises-questions.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/YPK6G7RVBJFGPFYRWFINTPF6GY.jpg?auth=250d65af53d9c5ed27d3da24b635a3c849c68874067c5356a4d3bc80ce4d9a74&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 23:00:01","author":"Kevin Manahan","authors":["Kevin Manahan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.352},{"id":288759940,"title":"Trump reacts to athletes emulating his dance moves","text":"One major trend that sparked in the sports world ahead of the 2024 presidential election was athletes emulating President Donald Trump’s dance moves during a game or match.

Eric, for his part, matched his dad in a blue suit — though the 41-year-old opted for no tie.\n\nShortly before the game began, Donald, his children and his grandchild were seen deboarding Air Force One at the Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base in the Big Easy.\n\nFederal law enforcement sources confirmed to The Post earlier this week that Donald, 78, was planning on attending the NFL event — making the politician the first sitting president in US history to do so.\n\nThe Post also confirmed that Donald sat for an interview with Fox News host Bret Baier, which aired on the network’s pre-game show just hours before kick-off.\n\nPrior to kickoff, the Republican revealed he’s rooting for the Chiefs.\n\nSources confirmed that the stadium’s security was beefed up in preparation for Donald’s attendance — nearly eight months after he survived an assassination attempt with just a gunshot to the ear.\n\nDonald’s arrival at Super Bowl LIX could be awkward considering outspoken anti-Trumper Taylor Swift was in the stands to support her boyfriend, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nLast September, Swift endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz and signed her message from a “Childless Cat Lady,” referencing Vice President JD Vance’s controversial comments about women who aren’t mothers.\n\nSwift’s announcement prompted Donald to declare his disdain for the pop star. \n\n“I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” Donald wrote on his social media platform, Truth Social, at the time.\n\nWhile Swift has been open about her criticism of the convicted felon, the singer’s close pal Brittany Mahomes is a known supporter of Donald.\n\nBrittany — who was seen in a VIP suite as she cheered for her husband Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes Sunday — previously expressed her support for Donald on social media.\n\nDonald shared his gratitude for the Sports Illustrated model, writing on Truth Socia last September, “I want to thank beautiful Brittany Mahomes for so strongly defending me, and the fact that MAGA is the greatest and most powerful Political Movement in the History of our now Failing Country.”\n\nHe added, “With Crime and Illegal Immigration totally out of control, INFLATION Ravaging all Americans, and a World that is laughing at the stupidity of our hapless ‘leaders,’ it is nice to see someone who loves our Country, and wants to save it from DOOM.” \n\nDonald, who served his first term in the White House from 2017 to 2021, took the oath of office during his second inauguration ceremony last month.","summary":"Sources confirmed to The Post earlier this week that Trump was planning on attending the Super Bowl -— making him the first sitting president to do so.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/02/09/entertainment/president-donald-trump-attends-super-bowl-2025-with-kids-ivanka-and-eric/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/02/trump.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/ClR7AT8i-guILbWnz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-09 22:49:47","author":"Leah Bitsky","authors":["Leah Bitsky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.504},{"id":288758808,"title":"Travis Kelce savagely mocked as he arrives ready for the Super Bowl in unique outfit","text":"Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has made quite the style statement ahead of his team's big Super Bowl match later this evening. \n\nThe boyfriend of pop star Taylor Swift and his team The Chiefs are seeking an unprecedented third consecutive Super Bowl crown and fourth in six years when they face the Eagles, a rematch of the Super Bowl from two years ago when the Chiefs rallied for a 38-35 win.\n\nTravis, 35, has made his grand entrance at the Superdome in a bold outfit, sparking a series of memes and jokes online. The sports star was spotted leaving the Chiefs' Marriott hotel in New Orleans, donning a daring brown Amiri suit and sunglasses, giving fans an early peek at his ensemble as he strolled to the team bus.\n\nHis outfit included a matching shirt, jacket and trousers, tinted sunglasses, a gold brooch and a black bag. The suit is from Amiri's Fall/Winter 2025 collection, and he was also seen carrying a 'cherry ice pop' flavoured Accelerator energy drink.\n\n\"Travis Kelce arrives looking like a 70s porn director… or maybe an extra in Starsky & Hutch,\" one Twitter (X) user mused, with another adding: \"Travis Kelce looks like he's filming a Bee Gees biopic.\" A third quipped: \"Travis Kelce looks like he was just acquitted of killing disco.\"\n\n Earlier this week, Travis sparked some anger amongst his girlfriend's fanbase as he claimed it will be a \"great honour\" to play in front of US President Donald Trump in Sunday’s Super Bowl. Trump is due to become the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl when the Chiefs face the Philadelphia Eagles at the New Orleans Superdome this evening. \n\nTravis' girlfriend Taylor publicly criticised Trump and endorsed his rival Kamala Harris during last year’s election, welcomed Wednesday’s announcement. \"That’s awesome, it’s a great honour,\" the 35-year-old said. “No matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life. Having the president there, it’s the best country in the world and that’s pretty cool.\"\n\nTaylor and Trump clashed during the presidential election with Taylor endorsing Harris, prompting Trump to post on his social media platform Truth that he \"hated”\" the singer. Trump later added that he liked Travis \"even though he may be a liberal and probably can’t stand me!\"\n\n Trump has also praised Travis' team-mate, quarterback Patrick Mahomes, who likewise welcomed the announcement that Trump will be in New Orleans. \"I didn’t see that clip but obviously it’s cool to hear that he’s seen me play football and respects the game that I play,\" Patrick said. \"It’s always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president, someone in the top position in our country.\"\n\nLike this story?

The poll found that 18 percent of respondents said that Musk and his DOGE acolytes should have “not much” influence on government operations and spending, while 31 percent said they should have none at all. Predictably, the support differed along partisan lines: Nearly three-quarters of Republicans surveyed said Musk and DOGE should have “a lot” or “some” influence, whereas nearly a third of Democrats said they should have “not much” or “none.” \n\nThis comes as the latest bit of mounting evidence showing Americans don’t want Musk running the government: Just this week, a poll from the Economist/YouGov also showed that 51 percent of Americans believe Musk has a lot of influence in the government, while only 13 percent want him to have that much influence; 46 percent, on the other hand, don’t want him to have any influence. Another poll released this week from progressive advocacy groups Groundwork Collaborative and Public Citizen in partnership with Hart Research found 54 percent of voters have an unfavorable opinion of him, with a majority also saying he has too much influence and involvement in the government and that they have less favorable opinions given the lack of oversight regulating potential conflicts of interest with his companies as well as the ability of DOGE to access unclassified information.\n\nLast month, a Quinnipiac University poll found 53 percent of respondents disapprove of Musk’s prominent role in the Trump administration, and a another January poll, from the Associated Press-National Opinion Research Center, found that a majority of Americans don’t want Trump relying on billionaires or family members for policy advice and have an unfavorable opinion of Musk.\n\nAll in all, this is not surprising, given that, as Mother Jones editor-in-chief Clara Jeffery wrote earlier this week, nobody voted for Musk, an unelected tech billionaire. The latest data offers a clear rebuke to the hurricane of chaos that Musk and his cronies at DOGE and across the federal government have unleashed since President Trump’s inauguration.\n\nIn case you’ve been living under a rock, that chaos has included trying to pay federal workers to quit their jobs; attempting to gain access to US Treasury data; threatening to shutter USAID, a federal agency tasked with supporting critical humanitarian and development work around the world; taking over the Education Department, which Musk claimed on X the other day “doesn’t exist”; and threatening reporters who report critically on DOGE. (And given that the department is reportedly staffed by Gen Z fanboys and former staffers of Musk—one of whom, Marko Elez, resigned on Thursday after the Wall Street Journal unearthed openly racist posts on an account linked to him, before Musk promptly rehired him the next day—there has been plenty to cover.)\n\nThe CBS/YouGov poll released Sunday showed other Trump policies that are also unpopular: 52 percent of respondents said they oppose building large detention centers to house people awaiting decisions on whether or not they’ll be deported; only 13 percent said the US trying to take over Gaza, as Trump proposed this week, would be a good idea (47 percent called it a bad idea, and 40 percent said they’re unsure); 66 percent said Trump is not focused enough on lowering prices; and large majorities said they oppose new US tariffs on goods from Mexico, Europe, and Canada (economists have said those tariffs will likely raise prices for American consumers).\n\nBut in a news release from the White House Sunday, responses to those data points in the new CBS poll were invisible. “Americans Are Loving the New Golden Age,” the press release claimed, touting Trump’s 53 percent approval rating, the 70 percent of poll respondents who said Trump is doing what he promised on the campaign trail, and the majority approval for his mass deportation plan and his handling of the Israel-Hamas conflict. (Never mind that those assertions would seem to be in conflict with some of the other findings mentioned above—such as the limited support for his floated plan to take over Gaza.)\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt shared the headline from CBS on X: “Trump has positive approval amid ‘energetic’ opening weeks; seen as doing what he promised,” it read. Leavitt’s enthusiastic promotion of it was curious given that, just a few days ago, her boss, President Trump, said in a post on Truth Social that CBS should “lose its license” over a 60 Minutes interview the network did with former Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. (Trump filed a lawsuit against the network, alleging that the 60 Minutes interview was deceptively edited to make Harris look better; CBS denies those allegations and this week released the raw footage and transcript of the entire interview, which it also provided to the Federal Communications Commission upon request.) \n\nThe White House’s promotion of the latest CBS poll—and its refusal to seriously engage with public criticisms of Musk, along with other points of contention—offers a clear example of its hypocrisy regarding its attacks on journalism and truth: What Trump’s acolytes see as favorable to him get labeled as legitimate, whereas anything more critical gets branded “fake news”—or simply ignored. \n\nWhen it comes to Musk, they’ve continued to defend him—and showed how unseriously they seem to be taking his position in the highest levels of government. At a press briefing this week, Leavitt said that Trump was clear on the campaign trail about the role Musk would play in his administration. Separately, when a CNN reporter asked Leavitt what kind of security clearance Musk has, if he passed a background check, or if the DOGE team members raising the Treasury Department or USAID, she said she didn’t know and would have to check. The White House does not appear to have clarified those points yet.\n\nBut if Democrats continue attacking Musk and the role of oligarchy in the Trump administration, as they did this week, the White House may have no choice but to confront the discontent around Musk and DOGE head-on.","summary":"Yet more evidence shows Elon Musk and his cronies at the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) are unpopular with Americans.

Cory Booker said Sunday on CNN that the Democratic Party’s plan to beat President Donald Trump “is working.”\n\nDemocrats have struggled to settle on a message that will win over voters in the upcoming midterms, after Trump won both the Electoral College and the popular vote in November. On “State of the Union,” CNN host Dana Bash asked Booker point-blank why the party “didn’t have a better plan,” after highlighting that the Trump administration’s current strategy to “do as much at once” to “overwhelm the system” had been previously “laid out in Project 2025.”\n\n“Well, again, I think the plan right now is working in four parts. One is a legal strategy to stop him from violating the separation of powers, from violating our civil service laws, civil rights laws and we’re winning. We see 41 cases being taken, 10 of them last week, 12 of them, excuse me, were successful in stopping some of his illegal actions,” Booker said. “The next is a legislative and oversight effort to really try to expose it, not to treat this as Democrat versus Republican, right or left, but really right or wrong and continue to try to use our positions procedurally as well as legislatively to stop what he’s doing.”\n\n“Then finally, perhaps most importantly, because all of us have to have a role, from the media to everyday citizens, which is shining a light on the dark corners of what they’re doing and how it is actually endangering Americans’ lives, is threatening to raise the cost of people’s everyday goods and inflation and more,” Booker added.\n\nIn their most recent attempt to push back against Republicans, Democrats have been seen protesting with supporters against the Department of Government Efficiency’s (DOGE) Elon Musk and his involvement in the Trump administration.\n\nThe heavy criticism of Musk came after he and the president upended the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) after Musk and the DOGE team discovered billions of taxpayer dollars wasted, with some reports revealing that money allocated to international programs had a high risk of ending up in the Taliban’s hands and also aiding an organization linked to the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nHowever, despite Booker’s response, Bash pushed back against the lawmaker and called out how Mother Jones reporter David Corn described their strategy of using social media against Republicans “as bringing a teaspoon to a gunfight.”\n\n“Again, I’ve been blown away by what I’m seeing, by everyday citizens joining together and beginning to shine a much better light on what’s happening,” Booker continued. “Take USAID and the efforts last week to show that what the Trump administration has done is make Americans less safe from diseases like Ebola or treatment-resistant tuberculosis, taking away scientists on the front line of fighting these infectious diseases because we know infectious diseases anywhere are a threat to human safety everywhere.”\n\n“So a lot of the things that Trump is doing, that some of the biggest officials in our state, like, remember, Secretary Mattis, his defense secretary, saying very bluntly, ‘If you cut these kind of programs in the State Department, buy me more bullets, because it’s going to mean that we’re going to use military more.’ By shining a light on these things, by elevating, as we’ve seen online this past week, literally hundreds of millions of shares and likes, exposing what’s going on, this is giving us more strength in actually stopping him from doing what he’s doing,” Booker said.\n\nWhile Democrats have attempted to determine why they lost in November, some leaders, like Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and newly-elected Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, have stated that the party’s policies weren’t to blame. Instead, they pointed to voters’ understanding and a messaging issue.\n\nPost election polls show that former Vice President Kamala Harris had not only earned 7 million fewer votes than Biden in the 2020 race, but Trump gained 2.5 million more votes than in 2020 but also eroded Democrats’ hold on certain segments of the electorate.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He’s the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, and shortly, he’ll hear how the over 70,000 people filling the stadium feel about that.\nWhile the president’s guest list for the big game hasn’t been released, he’s expected to be joined by some family members and others in his regular posse. House Speaker and Louisiana representative Mike Johnson will likely join the president in his box. His oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., along with his girlfriend Bettina Anderson, were in NOLA on Saturday night for a pre-Super Bowl party. Elon Musk, the world’s richest man who has spent the last few weeks upending federal funding systems in Washington, has been spotted at the last two Super Bowls and may make an appearance this year, too.\nThe former first lady, and longtime Eagles fan, Jill Biden, will also be in attendance.\nSince Trump announced this week that he’d be at the Super Bowl as the invited guest of Gayle Benson, the owner of the New Orleans Saints, major players from both teams have been asked to weigh in.\n“That’s awesome. It’s a great honor,” Travis Kelce, the tight end for the Chiefs, said. “I think you know, no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there—it’s the best country in the world—and that’s pretty cool.”\nTrump has publicly disparaged Taylor Swift, who is dating Kelce, even posting “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” after the singer endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\nChiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes also answered that it would be “cool” to play in front of the President, saying, “It’s always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president, someone that is at the top position in our country.” His counterpart, Eagles QB Jalen Hurts, said that the president’s attendance wouldn’t bring any added pressure.\nAt this Sunday’s game, for the first time since 2021, the message “End Racism” will not be stenciled on the turf above one of the teams’ end zones. It’ll be replaced by “Choose Love.” The move from the NFL comes after Trump signed executive orders targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion measures in practically every corner of government.\n(The NFL has held that the messaging swap is unrelated to Trump’s plan to attend the game, and is instead meant to “capture and lift the imagination of the country,” according to spokesperson Brian McCarthy.)\nTrump’s choice to attend the game is the latest episode in his long and fraught relationship with the National Football League.\nAs early as the 1980s, Trump has wanted to own an NFL franchise, including the Baltimore Colts, the New England Patriots, and the Buffalo Bills. When he didn’t score a team, he ended up buying the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League in 1984. As the New York Times’s Ken Belson reported Sunday, Trump would go on to push other owners to sue the NFL for trying to prevent the USFL, who play in the spring, from participating in the fall. “After a bitter trial,” Belson writes, “the league was awarded three dollars in damages” and collapsed soon after.\nIn the 2010s, Trump utilized his connection with Patriots owner Robert Kraft to help raise his profile with football fans, gaining the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and owner coach Bill Belichick. Kraft and six other team owners each donated $1 million to Trump’s 2017 inauguration.\nDuring Trump’s first term, he railed against protests taking place in the NFL to address racism in the organization. As Colin Kaepernick and other players began to kneel during the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” Trump called for the NFL to make a rule against the action, calling it “total disrespect.” Back in 2018, when the Eagles took home the Super Bowl title, nearly all of the players and coaches said they would boycott the traditional visit to the White House due to Trump’s rhetoric around kneeling.\nIn response, the then-president canceled the invite, saying at the time, “The Philadelphia Eagles are unable to come to the White House with their full team to be celebrated tomorrow.” “They disagree with their president,” he continued, “because he insists that they proudly stand for the national anthem, hand on heart, in honor of the great men and women of our military and the people of our country.”\nAccording to CBS News, fewer than 10 members of the team planned to attend Trump’s celebration.","summary":"As the first sitting president to attend the National Football League title game, Trump might steal the show, although Taylor Swift may disagree.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-super-bowl-59-philadelphia-eagles-kansas-city-chiefs","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67a8fff409d0f21f5a15fa09/16:9/w_3648,h_2052,c_limit/2193163466","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 19:37:02","author":"Katie Herchenroeder","authors":["Katie Herchenroeder"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.403},{"id":288726192,"title":"James Carville wonders if there's 'plant' in progressive wing to see how many 'stupid things' they can embrace","text":"James Carville suggested there could be a \"plant\" in progressive Democratic politics during his podcast on Thursday to see how many \"stupid things\" the party could embrace while discussing the Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair race.

Every notion we take for granted today started life in complete obscurity. The Persian cavalry invented high heels in the 10th century to help them ride horses. In the 17th century, King Louis XIV popularized red high heels in Europe as a symbol of power and wealth. By the 1800s, women started wearing high heels as a fashion statement. It took 800 years for high heels to become a global trend. Limited information networks, slow transportation and resistance to foreign ideas stunted cultural exchange. Marco Polo spent three years travelling from Venice to Beijing by ship, horse, camel and foot. In 2025, a message can travel around the world in a matter of seconds.\n\nNew ideas spread faster and more widely than at any point in history. The proliferation of information has changed our understanding of what constitutes a trend. A trend used to represent a changing pattern of values, ideas and behaviors. Trends were emergent, transformative and semi-permanent. Like the revival of classical Greek and Roman culture in Renaissance Italy. The blending of African, Latin and European music by African American communities during The Jazz Age in 1920s America. And the rejection of traditional norms and embrace of rock and roll in the 1960s. Each cultural period had unique and competing markers of identity, often lasting for decades.\n\nIn contrast, trends are now viewed as fleeting moments, void of cultural meaning. Brands and marketers should apply the Lindy Effect when exploring and analysing culture. The Lindy Effect posits that the longer something has been around, the more likely it is to continue to exist. Around 7.5 million blogs are posted every day. More than 500 hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute. And 34 million videos are posted on TikTok every day. Most people are not seeing the same content at the same time. We no longer have a shared cultural frame of reference. The rest of this article explores how we got here and why brands need to escape the TikTokification of cultural trends.\n\nFleeting Memes\n\nAndy Warhol famously said: \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes.” The same premise can be applied to social media trends. All trends go through five key stages: introduction, rise, peak, decline and obsolescence. The stages haven’t changed, but the volume has increased, and the speed has accelerated. We end up confusing social media fads for cultural trends. These fleeting memes have such a short life expectancy that they’re often hard to recall once they disappear from the spotlight. In the words of the Chinese philosopher Lao Tzu: “The flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long.”\n\nRemember when the Stanley cup went viral? The 110-year-old brand became a must-have accessory for young people. The company’s revenue jumped from $75 million in 2022 to $750 million in 2024. But now, the brand is experiencing backlash for being the latest symbol of overconsumption. How about Barbie-mania? For a month, everything was Barbie pink, with brands trying to capitalize on the hype around the movie. But very quickly, Barbie-mania gave way to Brat Summer, a trend which was adopted by Kamala Harris’ campaign. Marketing departments often seed such moments—with paid influencers—but micro-trends usually take on a life of their own when early adopters share and remix the content on social media.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nWho Is Performing At The 2025 Super Bowl? Every Artist Confirmed So Far\n\nMost Sophisticated Gmail Attacks Ever—FBI Says: Do Not Click Anything\n\nWWE Releases 4 More Superstars Continuing Roster Purge—Who’s Out?\n\nMicro-trends are always changing. What was hot last week is irrelevant the following week. The transient nature of micro-trends makes it impossible for brands to keep on top of the latest memes. The short window to capitalize results in much effort with little return. With every micro-trend comes an equally strong backlash against the so-called trend. Brands and marketers need to differentiate between fleeting fads and cultural trends. The difference resembles Sigmund Freud’s Iceberg Model, where the tip of the iceberg—in this case, social media fads – represents 10% of the equation despite being the most visible and easily accessible. The remaining 90% of culture is under the surface.\n\nThe sea of sameness\n\nThe proliferation of information and the micro-trend cycle has forced brands to submit to the all-knowing, all-powerful social media algorithm. Sameness has replaced originality. Each brand, irrespective of its history, audience and category, jumps on the same micro-trends in the hope of appearing culturally relevant and attracting a new generation of fans.\n\nA quick scroll on social media will reveal hundreds of social media managers commenting under the same trending videos for clout. No doubt, a handful of challenger brands might benefit from the first-mover advantage, but the rest will simply fade into the For You Page (FYP) like a finely blended soup with no distinct flavor or texture. Except for a handful of brands with unique personalities like Duolingo, Ryanair and Scrub Daddy—most brands have no right play in the space. The unsolicited brand invasion of social spaces accelerates the death of micro-trends. Killing the vibe for young people and online communities. Like a random stranger trying to interrupt a conversation among friends.\n\nThe new approach by brands highlights the fragmentation of media and the decentralization of culture. Historically, brands had the power to set the agenda and get people to embrace new trends. Now, most brands are servants of the algorithm, randomly commenting on trending videos in the hope of being part of the conversation.\n\nBuild your own platform\n\nBrands are desperate to jump on the next micro-trend, but most have nothing original to share. The purpose of a brand is to be distinctive and memorable, standing out from the competition. Being distinctive makes it easier for people to think of your brand in a buying situation. Chasing micro-trends and shouting into the social media abyss is a losing game with diminishing returns.\n\nBrands can actively contribute to society without leeching off cultural moments and discourse. The first step is having a unique brand platform and something to share with the world. This creates the foundations for community collaboration and long-term cultural programmes that add real value to people. The difference between fleeting fads and cultural trends is almost impossible to detect through desktop research. Brands and agencies need to partner with cultural insiders who are shaping the future in mutually beneficial and non-extractive ways. The most iconic brands don’t chase trends; they embrace the future and empower cultural movements.\n\nFollow me on LinkedIn.

That can get higher as the water content evaporates until it's completely dried out.\n\nStainless steel is very resistant to corrosion in environments with pH around the neutral 7, but in high pH and extreme low pH it overcomes the chromium protective layer that develops.\n\nSo, one could use bleach to create swastika designs on another person's Cybertruck, but That Would Be Wrong.\n\nAlso, it would seem reckless to do that before someone else fires paintballs to blind the on-board security cameras.\n\nfragMasterFlash \n\n(12) Funniest\n\n45 minutes ago\n\nYou buy the douche canoe, you get to paddle it up shiat creek.\n\n(3) Funniest\n\n36 minutes ago\n\nFark you, you know what you did.\n\nAxeofjudgement \n\n(0) Funniest\n\n35 minutes ago\n\nI mean she's not wrong.\n\nThis is the correct salute next to a musketeer\n\nNeoCortex42 \n\n(3) Funniest\n\n32 minutes ago\n\nkdawg7736: I have only seen one out on the road, and that was last fall.\n\nThere's one or two in my local area I see regularly.

Now, it could be a Super Bowl anthem","text":"(CNN) — Kendrick Lamar and Drake spent last spring trading disses. The rappers unleashed a slew of increasingly brutal attack tracks, taking aim at each other’s talent, parenting and race, among other sensitive subjects.\n\nIt wasn’t until Lamar released “Not Like Us” that a verdict was rendered — Lamar had unequivocally won.\n\n“Not Like Us” is still taking a victory lap that began last May. Lamar’s final Drake diss topped the Billboard charts and became his first solo number-one single since 2017’s “Humble.” At a surprise Juneteenth concert, Lamar performed the song five times to an arena full of fans who knew every word. Then, last week, he took home five Grammys for the track, including song of the year.\n\nAnd on Sunday night, he’s expected to perform it at the Super Bowl, the most-watched event in American TV (even though the song is currently at the center of a lawsuit brought by Drake against the company that runs both rappers’ record labels).\n\n“Not Like Us” was introduced to the world unceremoniously in a YouTube link on a Saturday evening. That it’s since become one of Lamar’s biggest songs is a testament to its staying power, not just as a diss but as a certified banger.\n\n“As much as it’s a diss song, it’s also a unifying song,” said Frederick Paige, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering at Virginia Tech and co-founder of Virginia Tech Diggin’ in the Crates: Hip Hop Studies at the university.\n\nHere’s how a hard-hitting diss became a blockbuster of super proportions.\n\nHow the Kendrick-Drake beef began — and ‘Not Like Us’ won the war\n\nThe beef between two of the country’s best-loved rappers had been brewing for years before “Not Like Us” erupted.\n\nThough they featured on each other’s songs early in their careers, the two have exchanged sneak disses over several years — lines so cryptic even their fans couldn’t agree who they were about.\n\nTheir beef started boiling again in October 2023, when J.Cole referred to himself, Drake and Lamar as the “big three” of rap. Lamar disagreed — there’s only the “big me,” he said in the Future/Metro Boomin song “Like That,” released last March.\n\nDrake started to catch stray insults from artists like Future and The Weeknd, a fellow Toronto native, but the Lamar hit stung. So in April Drake dropped “Push Ups,” mocking Lamar’s features on songs from Maroon 5 and Taylor Swift.\n\nLamar responded with “Euphoria,” a vicious track that prodded the perceived insecurities of the Canadian rapper, including numerous references to his race.\n\nEach new song escalated the tension, which eventually grew so thick that the rappers took mere hours to respond with a new attack. The verbal brawl effectively ended, though, when Lamar dropped “Not Like Us.” In it, Lamar accuses Drake of being attracted to underage girls.\n\n“You know the Michelle Obama quote, ‘When they go low, we go high’?” Paige said. “They went in the basement. The degree of dirt and allegations made … it’s tough.”\n\nThough Drake released another song after “Not Like Us,” the war was already won. It didn’t take long for the charts and streamers to catch up.\n\nHow ‘Not Like Us’ went stratospheric\n\n“Not Like Us” became inescapable in what felt like a matter of hours. It’s been viewed nearly 200 million times on YouTube and took off on TikTok and traditional radio. Less than two weeks after its release, “Not Like Us” clinched the top spot on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nLamar had everyone from middle schoolers on the dancefloor at a bar mitzvah to former Vice President Kamala Harris at the BET Awards quoting his single.\n\n“I see dead people,” Lamar whispers at the track’s opening. Aside from the devilish glee with which he delivers his blows, it’s not your typical missive from a hater, Paige said. It sounds like a party from the first beat drop.\n\n“It’s a super catchy tune that you wouldn’t expect to be a diss track,” he said. “It doesn’t sound that aggressive.”\n\nIt’s also intensely catchy and quotable (though most of its blows can’t be repeated here), said Craig Arthur, an associate professor of practice at Virginia Tech and DJ who also co-founded the university’s hip-hop studies program.\n\nEven its slight chorus, in which Lamar chants the words “they not like us” repeatedly over a slick Mustard beat that took the producer only 30 minutes to cook up, is an earworm. (See: the star-studded crowd at the Grammys sing in unison when the song played as Lamar collected one of his awards.)\n\nTypically, the subject matter of a song like “Not Like Us” is controversial enough that an industry body like the Recording Academy would avoid rewarding it. But the song’s impact was so immediate and undeniable, based on its more than one billion streams and consistent chart placement, that even the Grammys, music outlets and celebrities who have previously been friendly with Drake celebrated it.\n\nLamar has also earned enormous respect from both rap fans and the artistic establishment, which might explain why the song has been so widely embraced, both professors said. Routinely referred to as the best rapper alive (a title to which many of his peers have laid claim), he’s won 22 Grammys — making him one of the most-awarded rappers in the award show’s history. And in 2018, he became the first rapper to win the Pulitzer Prize for music for his album “DAMN.”\n\n“(‘Not Like Us’) came from a highly decorated emcee that even folks far outside of hip-hop look up to,” Arthur said. “Kendrick can do things artistically that a lot of commercial mainstream rappers and emcees can never do.”\n\nWhen it’s not taking shots at Drake, “Not Like Us” is an homage to West Coast hip-hop. It’s a rejection, too, of “culture vultures” who appropriate the culture of a hip-hop community without belonging to it, Paige said. Its music video honored Lamar’s Compton roots –– behind-the-scenes footage shows he was received like a hometown hero.\n\nLamar’s disses against Drake worked because he took aim at Drake’s perceived inauthenticity, both professors said, and a lack of connection to a homegrown rap scene like Lamar’s community in Compton or in Atlanta, where many of Drake’s previous collaborators are from.\n\nThough Drake’s poppier hip-hop strategy has perhaps alienated him from some of his peers, it’s also cemented him as one of the most famous rappers on Earth. Lamar’s targeting Drake so publicly was intentional, too, Paige said.\n\n“I think (Lamar) took on Drake for a very particular reason, in terms of that fan base and that outreach to grow (Lamar’s) fan base and show that real artistry, in his opinion, and authenticity win over all the circus tricks,” Paige said.\n\nWhat it would mean to hear ‘Not Like Us’ at the Super Bowl\n\nLamar is an inspired choice for the Super Bowl halftime show, both professors said. Lamar’s subject matter spans his experiences growing up in public housing to institutionalized anti-Black racism and police brutality.\n\n“It’s really interesting to think about a song like ‘Alright,’ which is seen as a protest song, and then go to the Super Bowl,” Paige said. What is the chess move there?”\n\nThere are also questions around how Lamar will handle incorporating “Not Like Us” into his Super Bowl performance. Lamar and Drake both belong to labels under Universal Music Group, Inc. Drake has filed a lawsuit against the company, accusing the label of defamation in the publishing and promotion of “Not Like Us.” Lamar isn’t named in the suit.\n\nEven if Lamar does perform the track, fans shouldn’t expect “Not Like Us” to receive a reception like the one it received at his Juneteenth concert, Paige said.\n\n“Some of these folks are not going to be in tune with ‘Not Like Us,’” he said. “What is the aftermath of this, when certain very wealthy people are engaged with the power of this song and the power of what Kendrick does as a musician?”\n\nIt’s a poignant moment for him to bring a dose of reality to the Super Bowl, even if the victorious “Not Like Us” makes a set list appearance, too. “Being human and surviving tough times” are central themes in Lamar’s work, Paige said, in between his rapper braggadocio.\n\n“There are a lot of people right now that are struggling with our political shifts — trying to figure out where we’re going to go, how we’re going to take care of ourselves and each other,” he said. “I’m interested in seeing how Kendrick takes on that challenge to motivate and excite people for not only the second half of football, but for many years to come.”\n\nThe-CNN-Wire™ & © 2024 Cable News Network, Inc., a Time Warner Company.

In an excerpt released by the network ahead of broadcast, Trump is asked about his faith in Musk — whose DOGE team lacks any kind of congressional authorization or approval — and asserted that his newest billionaire best friend was not in a position to gain anything of value from his Cabinet-adjacent position.\n\n“Bottom line, you say you trust him?” asked Baier.\n\n“He’s not gaining anything from this,” Trump answered. “In fact, I wonder how he can devote the time to it. He’s so into it.”\n\nThe president also maintained his position that much of the bloated federal budget related to “kickbacks” and the kind of waste and fraud that hardline conservatives have long maintained is rampant within federal programs meant to assist Americans — everything from student loans to foreign aid. \n\n“I ran on this,” said the president. “And the people want me to find it.”\n\nThe DOGE team’s effect on the federal government so far has thrown Democrats into a panic. Members of the party’s congressional delegation attempted without success to enter the Department of Education’s building in Washington several times over the past week, each time being turned away by guards who refused entry into the locked headquarters (which usually allows visitors into the lobby to speak to officials stationed at the front desk).\n\nIn his interview airing Sunday, Trump said that DOGE would find those “kickbacks” and other waste at the Department of Education, while vowing that they would be sent to slash spending at the Pentagon as well.\n\n“He’s going to find the same thing [at Education]. Then I’m going to go to the military, let’s check the military. We’re going to find billions, hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud and abuse.”\n\nOperating under a self-imposed shroud of secrecy, Musk’s team has been engaged in sudden and drastic changes across the federal government. DOGE staffers moved to implement Trump’s vision of completely shuttering the United States Agency for International Development, the main government agency overseeing the U.S.’s foreign aid programs, while seeming poised to attempt similar teardowns at other government agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nBut the efforts lack any basis in legislation approved by Congress and as such are being carried out under uncertain legal authority. Lawsuits have been filed by Democratic attorneys general around the country aimed at halting or reversing the shuttering of whole agencies and, in general, curbing the access and influence DOGE staffers have at federal agencies.\n\nOne of those lawsuits bore some success on Saturday as a federal judge ordered DOGE staffers to cease accessing sensitive systems at the Treasury responsible for disbursing payments across the federal government. \n\nThose staffers were also ordered to delete any data acquired from their usage of the Treasury’s systems.\n\nThe reaction on the right was swift and unsurprising. Musk tore into the judge as “corrupt” in a series of tweets while Vice President J.D. Vance seemingly suggested in his own post on Sunday that the Trump administration is considering ignoring court orders issued by federal judges when Trump and his team disagree with the rulings.\n\n“If a judge tried to tell a general how to conduct a military operation, that would be illegal. If a judge tried to command the attorney general in how to use her discretion as a prosecutor, that's also illegal. Judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power,” wrote the vice president.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats in Congress report frustration from their constituents who see the party as listless and lacking direction after vice president Kamala Harris’s brutal swing-state sweep at the hands of Trump in November. Even with resistance coalescing in the Legislative Branch this past week, little has been organized directly by Democratic leadership.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries attended a fundraiser in Silicon Valley this past week where some of that frustration bubbled to the surface. Politico reported that the donors present, largely tech CEOs and others in the industry, were unimpressed with Jeffries as he railed against Trump but offered little vision for the Democratic Party’s policy platform going forward.","summary":"Trump once again dismisses idea that billionaire Musk could reap financial gain from powerful DOGE position","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-fox-super-bowl-interview-musk-b2694969.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/09/16/trump_superbowl_2025.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 16:43:43","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.188},{"id":288658804,"title":"Trump Expands $10 Billion Lawsuit Against CBS to Include Paramount Global","text":"Donald Trump has expanded his $10 billion lawsuit against CBS News, now including CBS’s parent company, Paramount Global, as a defendant.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that CBS deliberately edited a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris to make her appear more articulate and competent.\n\nCongressman Ronny Jackson has joined the lawsuit, claiming he was “injured” by CBS’s actions as a consumer of news media.\n\nThe unedited interview was released by FCC Chairman Brendan Carr, revealing discrepancies between the aired and full versions.\n\nTrump’s legal team has filed a Freedom of Information request with the FCC for records related to his complaint.\n\nReports suggest that Paramount executives are considering settling the lawsuit, although CBS staff are opposed to any settlement.\n\nTrump has also criticized USAID, which he shut down, for allegedly paying Politico $8 million for employee subscriptions as part of media collusion with the Democratic Party.","summary":"Donald Trump has expanded his $10 billion lawsuit against CBS News, now including CBS&#8217;s parent company, Paramount Global, as a&#8230;","url":"https://pragativadi.com/trump-expands-10-billion-lawsuit-against-cbs-to-include-paramount-global/","image":null,"video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 15:29:50","author":"Fcc Chairman Brendan,pragativadinewsservice","authors":["Fcc Chairman Brendan","pragativadinewsservice"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":288663144,"title":"Donald Trump dropped major hint over who he is supporting at Super Bowl LIX","text":"Donald Trump will become the first sitting President of the United States to attend a Super Bowl on Sunday - but it remains to be seen who he'll be cheering on.\n\nTrump, who was officially sworn in for a second term in office at the start of the year, will be among the thousands in attendance at Caesars Superdome to take in the Kansas City Chief's eagerly anticipated showdown with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n Who Trump will be supporting, though, isn't clear.

So, that’d be pretty cool.”\n\nTrump and Swift - who endorsed the Republican's opponent, Kamala Harris, in last year's US election - are likely to be kept apart but all eyes will be on New Orleans come Sunday night in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe biggest event in American sport will be broadcast worldwide and huge numbers are expected to tune in to see if the Chiefs, led by star quarterback Patrick Mahomes, will be able to chalk up another Super Bowl triumph.\n\nIntriguingly, the Chiefs beat the Eagles two years ago in Arizona to start their championship run. And they will secure their place in the history back if they can repeat that feat on the grandest stage in New Orleans with the eyes of the world upon them.","summary":"United States president Donald Trump will be in attendance when the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles clash at Super Bowl 59 on Sunday in New Orleans","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/american-sports/donald-trump-superbowl-chiefs-eagles-34644076","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article34611449.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200/1_US-POLITICS-TRUMP.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 14:45:02","author":"Dan Marsh","authors":["Dan Marsh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.357},{"id":288658962,"title":"Trump’s nonstop deportations: Letters to the Editor — Feb. 10, 2025","text":"The Issue: ICE’s substantial amount of arrests since President Trump green-lighted deportation raids.\n\nI support President Trump’s quick and decisive actions of deporting illegal criminals.

An open letter to the Democratic Party","text":"We lost. But all is not lost. We can win in the next two critical national elections. How? What is next? We must improve our connection to and our communications with the middle class and blue-collar voters. We need to articulate, advocate and fight for new policies and change in government to protect the American Dream for all citizens. We must address the rapidly rising inequality in wealth, in our economy and in capitalism. We need to show average Americans that government is not rigged against them and only accessible mostly to wealthy donors. We need to restore trust in democracy by proving that efficient government programs can directly help them. We must be aggressive and tenacious once again, in the tradition of historic and inspirational leaders like Sen. Robert F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., by advocating for radical change in housing, education, health and labor rights. \n\nWe lost the presidential race and the Senate and failed to win back the House last year because we have been consistently losing white, Black, Hispanic and Asian middle-class voters over the past 25 years. This is an open wound which is bleeding profusely and if not addressed, could be the death of the patient. The loss in 2024 was not simply about Joe Biden's late departure from the Democratic field. We had an opportunity during the primary campaign (when we ignored Rep. Dean Phillips' warnings) to voice our concerns about Biden’s age or to remind him that we voted for him in 2020 to defeat Donald Trump and serve one term.\n\nMoreover, the blame does not rest on Kamala Harris and her valiant effort over 90 days to replace the incumbent. Democrats lost in 2024 because we have become the party of the status quo and could not overcome Trump, the agent of chaos and destruction. Defending the overall status quo at a time when the American Dream is slipping away for so many working Americans is politically tone-deaf and dangerously out of touch. Defending the status quo on rental rates and home prices, especially if you want the votes of middle-class people or voters under 40, is insane. Maintaining the status quo in education today too often translates to your educational future being determined by your zip code, not your GPA. Getting into private colleges, and being able to afford them, is increasingly reserved for millionaires and legacy kids. The status quo In health care means our seniors may need to win the lottery to afford heart medicine and blood pressure pills. \n\nDemocrats need to find ways to reduce bureaucracy, increase opportunities for home ownership and build affordable middle-class housing. We need to pioneer and announce new programs that grab the attention and support of angry and frustrated voters. If California finds ways to quickly rebuild housing in Los Angeles after this winter’s devastating fires, we need to replicate this nationwide. Voters ultimately picked their presidential candidate in 2024 based on two choices: 1) Keep things the same. 2) Blow things up. Harris was too often identified with the first position, even claiming that Trump wanted to go too far with his promises to “tear down the Department of Education.” Trump, of course, advocated the second position. There should have been a third choice: Big Change! We did not convey a message of fresh and viable economic change for working people. Nor did we stake out bold ideas for young voters, who increasingly voted Republican.\n\nBlue-collar voters in the heartland states (don’t call it the Rust Belt) have seen their jobs disappear due to trade, technology and globalization. You hear repeatedly from workers who once had good jobs in a steel plant or highly-paid jobs assembling cars that their lives are now virtually over. They recall being 35 years old and making great money but now, perhaps, they must work as Uber drivers, and make half their previous salary. They will tell you their children have “no future” in getting good jobs or achieving the American Dream. This is a wrenching gut-punch to the soul. Democrats need to be the working-class voice of frustration and their hammer for change. \n\nDemocrats did not lose the election in 2024 because we defended transgender choices or believe in climate change. We are morally right on both issues. We lost because we too often appear to lead our national agenda with these issues even as most Americans desperately want to hear about what we will do to curb rising housing prices, reduce escalating egg prices, keep gas prices low and fix out-of-control college costs. Food, energy, housing and education are core voting issues, especially when you experience them as reducing your choices and chewing up your family budget. This past week, Waffle House added a surcharge of 50 cents per egg, resulting in the average meal for two increasing to $27. Voters want to hear what we will do to protect their current job and create new ones. They want lower prescription drug costs and less Medicare bureaucracy. Please make a real difference in my daily life, they tell us. It’s almost like a desperate prayer. \n\nWe Democrats lost in 2024 because too many voters had the impression that we cared more about telling them to buy an expensive electric car than helping them repair their 10-year-old pickup. In October, I knocked on a door in Pittsburgh where a voter informed me that “Democrats want to ban my fracking job, tell me what kind of car to buy and rename my local school.” He went on to say, “I don’t have the luxury to care about all that other stuff when I don’t have a decent job and I can’t afford the future for my family.” Democratic presidents like Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson once had their pictures proudly displayed on the walls in these homes. These people used to be reliable Democratic voters. We need to loudly and proudly make the dignity of work, and the character it builds, the clarion call of our party. \n\nIn 2024, Democrats too often made the mistake of failing to respond to Republican attacks, particularly on the transgender issue. Harris was portrayed in a TV clip supporting generous resources for prisoners to access gender-affirming operations and drugs. I saw no timely or effective response from the Harris campaign in swing states. It appeared to many voters, falsely, as if this was the primary issue and singular focus of the Democratic candidate. Absent a compelling and succinct economic message, cultural issues took center stage. Democrats must boldly lead on the economic message and rebuild the American Dream. That must be our first, second and third issue. We can make policies impacting civil rights and extreme weather important issues in our national platform. Lesson learned: We must expect vicious attacks on these cultural stands and must proactively have the playbook ready to respond aggressively and powerfully. \n\nDemocrats need to have inclusive and respectful discussions on these cultural issues, because there are richly diverse opinions within our party and across the country. Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., said he believed his daughters should not have to compete against transgender athletes on the soccer field, and was unfairly vilified and ostracized by fellow Democrats. Democrats should be open to meaningful discussions on these issues and should listen to one another on all sides of these policies. We often criticize the MAGA wing of the Republican Party for dictating policy, and insisting that it’s “their way or the highway.” We should be a party that welcomes diversity and discussion and builds a big tent across America. Immigration should also be an issue where we can combine concerns about national security, human rights and new technologies to protect the border from drug cartels. \n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nDemocrats have been losing blue-collar and middle-class voters because we often don’t actively go to them, listen to their concerns and respectfully take in their opinions and criticism. Some say we lecture them, the way a professor does in a first-year freshman philosophy course. When a young senator from Illinois ran for president in 2008, he purposefully targeted independent and swing voters in suburban and rural areas. For example, he personally campaigned in my home state, visiting suburban Indianapolis and swing regions like LaPorte County in northwest Indiana, meeting with union members who were increasingly independent voters. Barack Obama played basketball with farm kids. He let pissed-off and laid-off workers blow off steam at him. He visited Indiana dozens of times. He pursued the strategy of \"losing by less,\" understanding that he would almost certainly lose most of these targeted counties and rural areas, but might shift them from 70-30 losses to 60-40 losses. He showed up, he listened and he proposed specific economic reforms to answer voters’ questions about jobs, schools and health care. What happened? He actually won Indiana in 2008, the first Democrat to do so since the 1964 Johnson landslide. Democrats must return to this proven template to aggressively pursue the middle-class vote and be willing to \"lose by less.\" We must be more competitive in more states, counties and small towns, even those we perceive as deep red. \n\nDemocrats should carve out distinct and important differences with Donald Trump’s Republican Party. Democrats are not in favor of pardons for violent convicted criminals who viciously assaulted our police officers on Jan. 6, 2021. Democrats are for safe and secure borders, but not for ripping up the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which protects the citizenship of everyone born in the USA. Democrats should support common-sense guardrails on technology to protect our children from predators and dangerous, addictive social media algorithms. Democrats should support AI efforts in biotechnology and antibiotics for better science, but must not allow Big Tech to create \"people robots\" that can eliminate tens of thousands of blue-collar and white-collar jobs. We want to “make in the USA” and insist on fair trade agreements with other countries, with real access to their markets to sell American products. Democrats don’t support wealthy oligarchs who buy elections and purchase access to government. Democrats need to draw clear, concrete lines voters can understand, so they can draw their own conclusions and make rational decisions. We must hold the Trump administration accountable. We must clearly announce and repeat our differences with them, and do vigorous battle for the hearts and minds of middle-class voters. \n\nStatistically, the Democrats did not suffer a devastating defeat last November. It was fairly close. A handful of House seats changing hands in 2026 will deliver a Democratic majority and a Democratic speaker. Recruiting the right candidates in the Senate to match the politics of each state, and to defeat Republican incumbents while avoiding divisive primaries, will help narrow the current gap. The number of talented and qualified potential Democratic presidential candidates for 2028 — Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Gov. Wes Moore, Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Secretary Gina Raimondo, Gov. Josh Shapiro, Gov. Andy Beshear, Gov. JB Pritzker, Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sen. Cory Booker, Sen. Amy Klobuchar and others — bodes well for our chances of winning the White House.\n\nBut although the future looks bright on many fronts, only 51% of Democrats believe their party is headed in the right direction, according to a Morning Consult poll published on Feb. 4. (That’s down from 65% in January 2024, while 84% of Republicans believe their party is trending the right way.) Rebuilding our economic message is the key to winning. The American Dream remains achievable, but the ladder required to climb up and grab it requires modernizing and repairing. The rungs on that ladder have always been education, jobs, housing and health care. Let’s learn from this past election, fix the mistakes we have made through the past several cycles, and propose a positive economic agenda for reaching the American Dream.","summary":"We can bring the party together — and win — if we're willing to address inequality and advocate for radical change","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/02/09/after-the-big-loss-whats-next-an-open-letter-to-the-democratic-party/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/02/protesters_holding_banners_signs_rally_2186413575.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 14:00:06","author":"Tim Roemer","authors":["Tim Roemer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.035},{"id":288661456,"title":"Donald Trump's chaos strategy: Why Americans continue to fall for his game of distraction","text":"President Trump and his MAGA Republicans and their forces are smashing American democracy, the Constitution, the rule of law, the institutions and norms. Trump has enacted over 50 executive orders since Jan. 20, the most in a president's first 100 days in more than 40 years. Some of the most egregious ones are blatantly unconstitutional and violate current law. It has only been three weeks since Trump returned to power; these are the good times compared to what will come next.\n\nBe very wary of any political observer or other public voice — or anyone else — who suggests that Trump and his MAGA movement are losing, in disarray, ineffective or somehow confused or weak. Such people are seeing what they want to see and not what is actually happening. Donald Trump and his MAGA movement’s strategy is chaos. Moreover, that chaos is in service to their shock and awe strategy to end America’s pluralistic democracy and to replace it with a form of autocracy if not outright fascism modeled on Viktor Orbán’s Hungary or Vladimir Putin’s Russia with Trump as de facto leader for life. As Harold Meyerson observes in The American Prospect, “As to the wider world, if we ever sought to be that beacon on the hill, we’re now the bully on the hill. America, Trumpified.”\n\nAmerica’s center is rapidly collapsing, and it has not been very difficult for Trump and the MAGA movement and the other fascists and authoritarians to break it. During these last three weeks, I have been repeating aloud, on the bus, during my walks, and at random times throughout the day, William Butler Yeats’ poem “The Second Coming,” particularly his warning that “the centre cannot hold\":\n\nTurning and turning in the widening gyre \nThe falcon cannot hear the falconer;\nThings fall apart; the centre cannot hold;\nMere anarchy is loosed upon the world,\nThe blood-dimmed tide is loosed, and everywhere \nThe ceremony of innocence is drowned;\nThe best lack all conviction, while the worst \nAre full of passionate intensity.\nSurely some revelation is at hand;\nSurely the Second Coming is at hand….\n\nAt the root of Trumpism and American fascism’s quick ascendance, and the pitiful resistance to it, is a profound failure of imagination. The phrase “failure of imagination” can trace its popular use in the United States to the Apollo 1 disaster and testimony by astronaut Col. Frank Borman. As depicted in the 1998 TV miniseries “From the Earth to the Moon”, Borman told Congress that:\n\nA failure of imagination. We’ve always known there was the possibility of fire in a spacecraft. But the fear was that it would happen in space, when you’re 180 miles from terra firma and the nearest fire station. That was the worry. No one ever imagined it could happen on the ground. If anyone had thought of it, the test would’ve been classified as hazardous. But it wasn’t. We just didn’t think of it. Now whose fault is that? Well, it’s North American’s [the capsule manufacturer] fault. It’s NASA’s fault. It’s the fault of every person who ever worked on Apollo. It’s my fault. I didn’t think the test was hazardous. No one did. I wish to God we had.\n\nThe failure of imagination that allowed Donald Trump and the MAGA movement to ascend to power is of a different type. It was wholly predictable. Trump and his agents were direct, vocal, and public in their plans to make him the country’s first elected dictator on “day one” and to launch a revolutionary project to return the country to the Gilded Age, if not before, and the types of destruction it would necessitate as the rights and freedoms of entire groups of Americans are taken away, the social safety net is further gutted, and the plutocrats and kleptocrats and White Christian Nationalists and other White racial authoritarians are given free rein over American life.\n\nIn many ways, the failure of imagination by the country’s “responsible” political leaders, the mainstream news media and the American public that empowered Trump and MAGA’s ascendance is willful and negligent. For years, these so-called responsible voices repeatedly proclaimed that Donald Trump was done for after his first term in office after a coup attempt on Jan. 6, twice impeached, multiple criminal and civil trials, a botched COVID response and an economy left in tatters. That did not happen.\n\nThese same “responsible” and “mainstream” voices also declared that there was no way that the Republican Party would nominate Trump to be its candidate in 2024, he is damaged goods with too much baggage, and the “adults in the room” would step in and rise to the occasion. Again, this did not happen. Donald Trump and his MAGA movement, almost quite literally, own today’s Republican Party and “conservative” and larger right-wing movement.\n\nThroughout the Trumpocene, these “reasonable” and “mainstream” voices were confident that “the walls were closing in” and heroes would rise, like in an old Hollywood movie, to vanquish the bad guy and save the day. First, it was Special Counsel Robert Mueller. Then the hero was Attorney General Merrick Garland. Then it was Special Counsel Jack Smith. The state prosecutors and attorney generals would supposedly be a heroic firewall and last line of defense against Donald Trump and his perfidy. The walls never did close in. Trump would become more popular following his prosecutions and trial(s) than before. Trump now wears “felon” as a badge of honor and courage, one that his MAGA followers and other Americans who are disgusted with the system flock to.\n\nThese “mainstream” and “reasonable” voices — especially the mainstream liberals and progressives — were mostly exuberant that Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden in the 2024 election. To them, Harris was a historic and compelling leader. She would be the first Black woman to be President of the United States. She is a committed public servant, magnetic, charismatic, compelling, and would attract young voters and college-educated white women who want to defend their reproductive rights and freedoms. The vibes! The brat energy! Beyonce and Taylor Swift and other celebrities are on Kamala Harris’ side! How can Donald Trump with his Village People \"YMCA\" dance, podcasts, the \"manosphere\" and professional wrestling and MMA fighters stop Kamala Harris and the Democrats? Impossible!\n\nThese “mainstream” and “reasonable” voices concluded that Donald Trump’s Madison Square Garden and how it channeled the infamous American Nazi rally of 1939 was a “disaster” and would lead to his defeat. I warned, however, that Trump’s MSG rally was actually a genius strategic and tactical move that made his MAGA people feel seen, as he was so bold as to launch a version of a military raid behind enemy lines in a solidly blue state and the Democratic Party stronghold of New York City.\n\nDonald Trump and the MAGA Republicans went on to easily defeat Harris and take control of all three branches of government. The fabled blue wall was easily pierced and then shattered. The Democratic Party’s base did not show up to vote. A majority of white women, again, supported Trump. Trump’s coalition grew and now includes a large number of Hispanics and Latinos — even as he threatened mass deportations against their community. Trump expanded his base of support in New York — as I warned and predicted — among a range of groups, including Hispanics and Latinos. A new poll from Quinnipiac University shows that the Democratic Party’s favorable rating is 31 percent. 57 percent of the people polled have an unfavorable view of the Democratic Party. By comparison, the Republican Party has a 43 percent favorability rating and 45 percent unfavorable.\n\nFor more than eight years, the mainstream news media and political class and other “reasonable” and “responsible” political voices and leaders could have adapted to the rise of Trumpism, American neofascism and the authoritarian populist moment. Instead, they continued with a habitual failure of imagination and the American people — and their democracy and society and future and freedom — are being made to suffer and are greatly imperiled.\n\nThis did not have to happen. In an essay in the Atlantic in May of 2024, Tom Nichols diagnosed and warned about the dangers of a failure of imagination and Donald Trump’s return to power:\n\nNostalgia and presentism are part of politics. But a second problem is even more worrisome: Americans simply cannot imagine how badly Trump’s first term might have turned out, and how ghastly his second term is likely to be. Our minds are not equipped to embrace how fast democracy could disintegrate. We can better imagine alien invasions than we can an authoritarian America. The Atlantic tried to lay out what this future would look like, but perhaps even words can’t capture the magnitude of the threat.\nWhen I was in high school and taking driver’s education, our teachers would show us horrible films, with names like Death on the Highway, that included gory footage of actual car wrecks. The goal was to scare us into being responsible drivers by showing us the reality of being mangled or burned to death in a crash. The idea made sense: Most people have never seen a car wreck, and expanding our imaginations by showing us the actual carnage did, I suspect, scare some of us into holding that steering wheel at the steady 10-and-2 position….We just don’t have a similar conceptualization for the end of democracy in America….\nTrump’s most alarmist opponents are wrong to insist that he would march into Washington in January 2025 like Hitler entering Paris. The process will be slower and more bureaucratic, starting with the seizure of the Justice Department and the Defense Department, two keys to controlling the nation. If Trump returns to office, he will not shoot democracy on Fifth Avenue. He and the people around him will paralyze it, limb by limb. The American public needs to get better at imagining what that would look like.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with On the Media, Masha Gessen offered this direct warning about the extreme danger(s) of Donald Trump and the MAGA movement:\n\nWe need to start imagining what happens if he becomes president. Now, the American system doesn't actually give the chief executive a lot of power. There is an intricate system of checks and balances that will force him to mobilize things through rhetoric. And that basically means, I think, that we have to start imagining witch hunts, we have to start imagining kind of wars at home. We have to start imagining what kind of groups he is going to start blaming for all his problems and all our problems, whether real or imaginary.” Gessen would be proven correct in ways far worse than perhaps even they imagined at time….My advice to the news consumer is - imagine the worst.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nIn a recent conversation with me here at Salon, Norm Orstein issued this ominous warning: “This is part of the biggest problem. We have lost our guardrails against autocracy. The press is pathetic. The Republicans running Congress are pathetic. The Supreme Court is in Trump's pocket. Civil society, starting with the business community, is worthless. Be afraid. Be very afraid.”\n\nAt the Bulwark, Jonathan Last says this about America’s failure of imagination and the worsening national emergency that is Trump’s return to power and his shock and awe campaign against American democracy and society:\n\nAnd here’s the point I want you to remember: When I say today, on January 27, that Trump’s gangster government is going to end badly—maybe even very badly—it sounds crazy and hysterical.\nBut if I described the state of affairs as they exist on January 27 to you twelve weeks ago, you also would have thought that I was crazy and hysterical. You would have said, “I guess that’s possible, but you’re talking about something close to a worst-case scenario.”\nYes, Putinism would definitely be a worst-case scenario.\nBut we are living the worst-case scenario right now. Maybe in the future something will slide us down the scale to one of the lower-variant scenarios. That would be nice. I hope it happens. But right now we are on track to a dark place.\n\nUltimately, Trumpism and American fascism and authoritarianism are a symptom and not the cause of much deeper and profound problems in American society and life. There were some voices, most notably Black and brown people and others who are not enamored with or blinded by America’s various myths of its own exceptionalism and greatness and the permanence of its “democracy”, that saw the danger clearly because they were not blinded by Whiteness and its many small and big lies that in total created the failure of imagination that led to Trump and MAGA’s triumphant return to power.\n\nDonald Trump’s autocracy is not a hypothetical or possibility far off in the future. It is here and now and very real. America’s crisis and failure of imagination has been subsumed by a horrible reality — one that is not going away anytime soon.","summary":"At the root of Trumpism's rapid ascendance, and the pitiful resistance to it, is a profound failure of imagination","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/02/09/donald-chaos-strategy-why-americans-continue-to-fall-for-his-game-of-distraction/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2025/01/donald_trump_2194441841.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 11:43:30","author":"Chauncey Devega","authors":["Chauncey Devega"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.414},{"id":288644934,"title":"Donald Trump heads to the Super Bowl with a complicated NFL history","text":"President Donald Trump will become the first sitting US president to attend the Super Bowl in person this Sunday, navigating a complex relationship with the NFL and a history of intertwining politics and sports.\n\nThe president will be present at the Superdome in New Orleans for the clash between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles. While the game itself will be the main focus, Trump’s reactions will undoubtedly draw attention.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs will face the Philadelphia Eagles in the 59th Super Bowl, after Patrick Mahomes led his side to a thrilling 32-29 win over the Bills.\n\nThe Chiefs are now the first back-to-back champions to return to the Super Bowl, having won the past two editions, and they are targeting an unprecedented ‘three-peat’ in 2025.\n\nIt is also the fifth time in the last six years that the Chiefs have reached the Super Bowl, winning three of the last five.\n\nTrump’s visit comes just weeks after the start of his second term, marked by executive orders targeting immigration and government diversity programs.

The examination extends even so far as San Francisco, a place famed for its liberalism and smugness, where the inward-looking reflection began even before Trump's restoration to the White House. In 2022, voters cast out three uber-progressive members of the school board, who seemed more intent on symbolic gestures, such as renaming public schools to erase the likes of Abraham Lincoln and Paul Revere, than student achievement. A few months later, the district attorney, Chesa Boudin, was recalled in response to his perceived bleeding-heart approach to public safety. Continuing apace, voters in November elected a political newcomer and relative moderate, Daniel Lurie, as mayor and punctuated the sentiment by gifting him a more simpatico Board of Supervisors at San Francisco's baroque City Hall. In the same vein, the city's Democratic Party, not exactly a pro-MAGA choir, has moved closer to the middle, electing a leader who sees Trump's election and improved standing in this blue bastion as one of those moments when red lights flash and sirens are blaring. \"One of the issues with the Democratic Party right now is that so much of party politics, especially at the local level, has been largely performative and not really relevant to the everyday lives of working people,\" said the local party chair, Nancy Tung. \"And I think we're seeing the backlash now nationally.\" San Francisco is not about to turn into a hillier version of Kansas, or become Alabama with views of the Pacific. Trump received 6,000 more votes here in November than he did four years ago and boosted his support by 2.5%. Still, he lost to Kamala Harris, the city's former district attorney, by nearly 65 percentage points. Tung's politics should also be put in some perspective. She checks all the Democratic boxes — pro-choice, anti-Trump and on — and laughingly jokes that in many places she'd be called a communist. But Tung is a centrist by San Francisco standards, and the city's political pendulum, which has long oscillated between left and far left, has clearly swung her direction. People \"can call me whatever they want,\" she said over lunch in the city's Mission District. \"I think government should work for people, and at the local level there's some really basic things that should not be controversial, right? Every community deserves good public schools. They deserve safe streets, clean sidewalks. Government that works, that's not overly bureaucratic ... that's not putting giant special interests ahead of everyday people.\" Tung, 50, is the daughter of Taiwanese immigrants. She grew up in Southern California, in Arcadia, before moving to the Bay Area, where she has spent most of her career as a prosecutor. Her work in the San Francisco D.A.'s office focuses on hate crimes. Tung began her political activism fairly recently, after Trump's upset victory in 2016. On a trip to Washington, she had planned to celebrate Hillary Clinton's historic election as America's first female president. Instead, she had an ugly cry at the National Portrait Gallery, seated before a rendering of women who've served on the Supreme Court. A few weeks later Tung was back in the capital, marching on the eve of Trump's first inauguration with bullhorn in hand. At home, she redoubled her political engagement by signing up with one of San Francisco's myriad Democratic clubs. Eventually, though, Tung grew estranged, feeling marginalized not because she was a woman or Asian American but because other Democrats wouldn't accept her comparative moderation. In 2019, she ran unsuccessfully for district attorney, losing to Boudin. The next year, the Board of Supervisors scuttled Tung’s nomination to the Police Commission because, in the climate following George Floyd's murder, she was seen as too pro-police. Slowly, however, the political winds shifted, as they often do. By 2022, it was the leadership of the San Francisco Democratic Party that seemed out of step. Among other moves, the party opposed the school board recalls, which 70% of voters supported, and the ouster of Boudin, who was handily turned out of office. In 2024, Tung led a centrist slate that took control of the party. Over lunch at a favorite Indian-Pakistani restaurant, she described her goals between now and the end of her term in April 2028. Tung's demeanor, as one might expect of a prosecutor, was no-nonsense. Arms crossed. Brow creased. The most important thing, Tung suggested, was moving away from abstractions and indulgences and addressing issues that touch voters' daily lives. Tung cited a resolution the local party passed some years ago opposing the use of child labor in Africa's chocolate trade. A terrible thing, yes. But why, she wondered, were Democrats in San Francisco devoting time to the matter? \"It makes people think you're out of touch,\" Tung said. \"Why is there something about child labor in another country and not something about how we're treating children here?\" That may be reductive, but the point is well taken. If the last election showed anything, it's that high-minded principles, like standing up for democratic norms, are less important to many voters than, say, the cost of gasoline and groceries. Democrats, Tung said forking a serving of rice and lentils, need to \"actually show people our value, like what we're doing in the community. ... Are you helping feed people? Are you helping clothe people? Are you helping to connect people to services? Are you helping people cut through red tape at City Hall?\" Inevitably, the conversation turned to Trump and fears the country is goose-stepping its way to dictatorship. Yes, Tung said, party leaders like herself can and should speak out and help channel Democratic outrage. There's information and resources to share with individuals and groups, such as immigrants, who may be targeted by punitive policies. \"Can we provide support to people who are impacted? Yes we can,\" Tung said. \"Can we provide a forum for people who want to speak out? Yes, you can do that, too.\" But the real resistance, Tung said, will have to come from elected officials, from members of Congress, from attorneys general and others fighting the Trump administration in court. She didn't say it, but the reality is if Democrats really hope to stop Trump's excesses and his bulldozing of federal programs, they'll have to take back some measure of power in Washington. And there's a great deal of work to be done.","summary":"The head of the local party is pushing for results over performative acts and ideological indulgence.

That was the sum tech entrepreneur Elon Musk donated to Donald Trump’s presidential election campaign. His reward was dramatically illustrated by the cover of this week’s Time magazine: an image of Musk, coffee cup in hand, sitting behind the Resolute desk used by every US president since Jimmy Carter.\n\nSome speculated that the picture of “President Musk” was designed to provoke the thin-skinned Trump, who is known to revere Time magazine and has twice been named its “person of the year”. The president reacted on Friday with a pointed joke: “Is Time magazine still in business? I didn’t even know that.”\n\nMusk, for his part, wrote on his X social media platform: “I love @realDonaldTrump as much as a straight man can love another man.”\n\nIt was the consummation of an unlikely relationship that is bringing an unnerving revolution to America. Trump and Musk share an appetite for disruption, rule-breaking and goading liberals. The convergence of the world’s most powerful man and the world’s richest man spells double trouble for democracy in the eyes of critics.\n\nCan the bromance last? Recent history is littered with examples of Trump acolytes who threatened to steal some of his limelight and paid the price. Sceptics have been predicting the demise of the Trump-Musk axis almost since it began, suggesting that two giant egos will surely collide.\n\nBut others perceive a symbiotic relationship that might go the distance. Joe Walsh, a former Republican representative and a Trump critic, said: “They’re the two most powerful people on the planet right now. They desperately need each other.\n\n“They’re in this for the long haul so people who think this thing’s going to bust up in a month or two are smoking something. We’re looking at four years of these two doing this. They are like two monsters and every day they’re growing stronger.”\n\nAt first glance, Trump and Musk have little in common. Trump is a 78-year-old property developer and reality TV star from New York who came to politics late, spends hours on the golf course and has a cultural frame of reference rooted in the 1980s.\n\nMusk, 53, was born in South Africa during the era of racial apartheid, made his fortune in Silicon Valley and is chief executive of Tesla, an electric vehicle maker, and SpaceX, a rocket company aiming for the stars. He has publicly stated that he has Asperger syndrome, part of the autism spectrum.\n\nIn 2016, he said Trump “doesn’t seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States”. In 2022, Trump described Musk as a “bullshit artist” for supporting his opponents in 2016 and 2020. By last year, both were singing a different tune.\n\nMusk threw his weight behind Trump in the election against Kamala Harris, becoming his top donor, speaking at campaign rallies and elevating pro-Trump propaganda on his X social media platform. He spent election night at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida, and celebrated his inauguration with an apparent Nazi salute.\n\nMusk has so far been the biggest single difference between Trump’s first term as president and his second. Dubbed “first buddy”, he was appointed as head of the “department of government efficiency” (Doge), a taskforce aimed at restructuring federal agencies, cutting budgets, rooting out waste and corruption, and dismissing employees.\n\nMusk, known for a leadership style that rules by fear and demands total loyalty from workers, has duly brought a Silicon Valley-style “move fast and break things” approach to scything through the federal government with no regard for the constitution or rule of law.\n\nHis Doge team of young software engineers quickly gained access to the treasury payment system, which is responsible for a billion payments a year totaling $5tn. It includes sensitive information involving bank accounts and social security payments.\n\nThen Doge shuttered the United States Agency for International Development (USAid) without seeking the necessary authority from Congress, destroying a tool of American soft power and severing vital food and medicine programmes worldwide. Musk tweeted gleefully: “We spent the weekend feeding USAID into the wood chipper.”\n\nDoge’s tactics have included locking out employees, freezing funding, terminating leases and offering “deferred resignation” packages to workers. Musk is also using his X platform to promote Trump’s agenda, attack critics and make outrageous statements. He labelled USAid as “evil” and a “criminal organization” without providing evidence.\n\nMusk is not a full-time government employee, instead holding a “special government employee” status, allowing him to sidestep financial disclosure and public vetting processes. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic minority leader in the Senate, said: “An unelected shadow government is conducting a hostile takeover of the federal government.”\n\nBut Trump appears unconcerned, claiming: “Elon can’t do and won’t do anything without our approval. And we’ll give him the approval where appropriate. Where not appropriate, we won’t.” A White House source told the Guardian that the president had recruited Musk to do “crazy shit” and he was delivering.\n\nTo some commentators, the match makes sense. Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University in California, said: “It’s safe to assume Donald Trump has always admired wealth and there are only a handful of people on the planet whom he can look northward to in terms of wealth and Musk is one of them.\n\n“Trump obviously has the power that Musk thrives on but the one thing that might be in common here is they both enjoy being disrupters and mischief makers.”\n\nMusk has incentives both financial and ideological. His companies have extensive contracts with the federal government and, as head of Doge, he is in a position to streamline regulations to directly benefit them.\n\nHe has also found common cause with Trump and his “Make America Great Again” (Maga) movement, making it clear that he is focused on eradicating the so-called “woke” agenda. He eliminated diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives at X, formerly Twitter, and appears to be bringing that mindset to his government work.\n\nHe shares Trump’s worldview on race. Musk has falsely claimed that the South African government is allowing a “genocide” against white farmers; Trump announced that he would shut down all aid to South Africa over what he alleged was a “massive human rights violation” in the form of a new land rights law.\n\nStill, no honeymoon lasts forever. Musk’s approval rating is falling fast, even among Republicans. Just 43% of Republican respondents say they want Musk to have “a little” influence, and 17% say they want him to have “none at all”, according to a recent poll from the Economist/YouGov.\n\nThis week, protesters outside government buildings carried hand-painted placards complaining: “Nobody elected Elon.” Democrats in Congress have made him their prime target, accusing him of an illegal power grab. Representative Jared Golden of Maine posted on X: “My constituents, and a majority of this country, put Trump in the White House, not this unelected, weirdo billionaire.”\n\nThis could make Musk a useful foil for Trump, deflecting attention from the president. But it might also eventually turn Musk into a political liability, leading voters to question which is the master and which the puppet. Pressure from allies such as Steve Bannon, a sharp critic of Musk and other tech oligarchs, and Republicans in Congress would surely grow ahead of next year’s midterm elections.\n\nRick Wilson, a co-founder of the Lincoln Project, a pro-democracy group that this week released an attack ad titled “President Musk”, said: “They will collide eventually. When Trump sees Elon causing political damage to him, he’ll cut the cord in a hot minute.\n\n“It won’t even take five heartbeats. Once he sees that Elon is dragging him down in the polling – and Elon has become spectacularly unpopular in the last few weeks – Elon’s going to have a rough moment.”\n\nOn the other hand, Musk is not like anyone that Trump has encountered before. His estimated wealth of $426bn dwarfs that of the president. He wields huge power and influence through X. He might prove harder to dispose of than previous lieutenants.\n\nCharlie Sykes, a conservative author and broadcaster, said: “I don’t know how he solves a problem like Elon. He can fire or destroy anyone else. He can brush Marco Rubio off. He could destroy JD Vance’s political future with a Truth Social post. But he’s stuck with Elon Musk.\n\n“Elon Musk now has his own power base. He’s got his own cult of personality. There’s going to come a moment where these egos are going to clash – there can be only one master of the universe at the same time – but how is this resolved? How does Trump disentangle himself from the Frankenstein’s monster that he’s gotten into bed with?”","summary":"The bromance may fade, but the two megalomaniacs could still reshape the US as long as Trump’s fickle affections hold\n\nA picture is worth a thousand words – or, more precisely, $288m.

Ticket prices, though still exorbitant, are thousands of dollars cheaper than last year, and fans everywhere seem to be rooting for the asteroid. On its face, this makes sense: Eagles fans have a rather earned reputation, even if the team has a running back who is an explosive talent and genuinely one of the most likable athletes in professional sports. As for the Chiefs, they’ve fully entered their villain era, with fans loving to hate the NFL’s latest formidable dynasty. Just five years ago, the Chiefs were largely celebrated for their win in Super Bowl LIV, the title that launched their dynasty. But a recent Economist/YouGov poll shows that more Americans are rooting against Kansas City than for them. It’s understandable that Americans are growing weary of seeing Kansas City in the Super Bowl; this will be the Chiefs’ fifth appearance in the last six years, they’ve won three of the last five, and they’re going for their third Super Bowl win in a row on Sunday, a feat that’s never been achieved. Every great team that reaches the level of perennial success the Chiefs have enjoyed eventually suffers this backlash, no matter the decade. Just ask the New York Yankees, Los Angeles Lakers, Golden State Warriors and most recently in the NFL, the New England Patriots. Columnists everywhere have explored the various reasons for this phenomenon, where dynasties become more disliked the longer their run. There are certainly psychological and cultural factors at play: As sports fans, we like to root for the underdog, and when it’s not our team that’s constantly winning, we see that dominance as undeserved. The saturation of coverage certainly hasn’t helped either. And yes, politics might play a slight role here, though I tend to think that’s overstated. Liberal-leaning fans have taken issue with Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes’ wife Brittany’s seeming support of Donald Trump on social media. Conservative-leaning fans aren’t fond of Taylor Swift, who endorsed Joe Biden and Kamala Harris in the past two presidential elections and is dating Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. But I think another factor is at play here, one peculiar to football. As sports fans, we’ve all bought into this belief that the NFL is a bastion of parity, a shining example of fairness for other leagues to follow. But that belies reality. According to the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective, of the four major North American men’s leagues, the NHL is actually the league that boasts the most parity. The NFL is third, just below MLB. And as The Athletic’s Jayson Stark noted Thursday, teams with Mahomes, Tom Brady and Peyton Manning at quarterback have appeared in 12 of the last 14 Super Bowls. In baseball, when teams like the Los Angeles Dodgers win multiple championships, it’s easy to point to the perceived unfairness in MLB, which has no salary cap. Big-market and wealthier teams can afford the best players, so fans of small-market teams can simply blame the system. The NFL has a hard salary cap, so richer teams can’t wildly outspend others. When a small-market team like the Chiefs keeps winning, fans of other teams can’t blame the system. A sportswriter friend who hails from Kansas City has an interesting theory: Part of the hate is really more frustration, annoyance and resentment, particularly from fans of other small-market teams, who see the Chiefs’ dynasty and think, “That could be us.” We’ve been conditioned to think of football as the fairest sport — the sport of true meritocracy, not legacy and wealth-based success — so when one team constantly wins, it catches us off guard. How can a dynasty exist in a league with features meant to level the playing field, like revenue sharing and a hard salary cap? That might be why fans have turned on the Chiefs so sharply. It also explains why, whereas the Yankees and the Lakers get accused of buying championships, the criticism this week is that the referees are in the bag for the Chiefs. That accusation has been so widespread that both the NFL referees union and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell felt compelled to respond. But the Chiefs have built their dynasty squarely within the rules, thanks in large part to front-office savvy. Yes, Mahomes has one of the more team-friendly contracts in the league, restructuring his deal before the 2023 season to receive less guaranteed money and allow the Chiefs more salary cap flexibility. But the organization has also simply been better than most in continuing to build around him. In 2022, Kansas City traded star wide receiver Tyreek Hill to Miami for five draft picks as Hill sought a massive contract extension. The Chiefs used two of those picks on cornerback Trent McDuffie and safety Chamarri Conner, both now part of one of the league’s top defenses. They’ve signed low-cost veterans like Kareem Hunt, JuJu Smith-Schuster and Mecole Hardman to round out their roster. The majority of their starters are homegrown — only two of their defensive starters weren’t drafted in-house — which speaks to just how well general manager Brett Veach and his team scout and develop talent. They’re winning because of great management — and what could be more meritocratic than that? It’s easy to hate the Chiefs and to want to see them toppled, but their dynastic run deserves as much admiration as annoyance. I’ll personally be holding my nose to root for the Eagles — as a Giants fan, I’d like to see Saquon Barkley get a well-deserved title. But remember that every dynasty eventually becomes the villain simply because we don’t like to admit when greatness is due. We hate ’em ’cause we ain’t ’em.","summary":"A recent poll shows that more Americans are rooting against Kansas City, who are playing the Philadelphia Eagles, than for them.","url":"https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/super-bowl-kansas-city-chiefs-villains-eagles-rcna191262","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250207-Kansas-City-Chiefs-aa-303-b1378c.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 11:00:40","author":"Kavitha A.

In effect, he’s staging a coup against American democracy,” he wrote online.\n\n“The courts are weighing in, some people are organising at the grassroots — but where the hell are the Democrats?”\n\nMany will dismiss Mr Reich’s comments as hyperbole from a figure on the left of US politics. \n\nBut his point about the whereabouts of the opposition holds merit. The Democrats appear to have gone M.I.A.\n\nMr Trump’s use of executive orders – diktats on how the government should be run – have been prolific. \n\nSo far, he has signed more than 50 covering everything from tariffs to transgender people. \n\nThat’s more than Joe Biden, who signed fewer than 30 in his first three weeks, and far more than Trump 1.0 over the same period. \n\nSome of these orders are legitimate. Others could cross a line where laws or the Constitution could be broken or Congress’ role usurped.\n\nAnd it’s not just executive orders. Democrats have made less fuss than expected on the pardoning of 1500 January 6 rioters, Elon Musk’s seemingly unfettered power, the cajoling of federal employees to resign and the threats to invade foreign lands. \n\n‘Crickets’ from Democrats\n\n“What’s been the Democrats’ response to these and other Trump initiatives right out of the pages of Project 2025 (a right wing plan of government Mr Trump insists he is not following)?” asked Bill Press, a former chairman of California’s Democratic Party on political website The Hill.\n\n“Crickets,” he replied.\n\nWebsite Axios has reported that Democrat Party offices are “being inundated” by phone calls from angry constituents want them to do more to combat President Trump. \n\nKamala Harris voters, for instance, are raging that President Trump cabinet picks, like vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy, seem to be getting an easier than anticipated ride to confirmation. \n\nBut University of Kansas professor of rhetoric and political communication Robert Rowland said there were harsh realities Democrats had to face. \n\n“Republicans have the votes in Congress to confirm Trump’s nominees if they stay united. \n\n“And so far they have stayed united,” he told news.com.au. \n\nThe Republicans, narrowly, control both houses of Congress. And very few Republicans seem keen so far to openly defy Mr Trump. \n\n“Moreover, attacking Trump’s actions requires Democrats to explain the government procedures and why (they believe) Trump’s actions are dangerous.”\n\nProf Rowland said public knowledge about policy and how Washington works was low in the US. \n\n“One example: the Affordable Care Act has always polled higher than ‘Obamacare’, despite the fact that they are the same law”.\n\n‘Biding their time’\n\nIn addition, where Mr Trump’s axe has fallen is on areas of government many Americans have little love of. \n\nMr Trump’s disbanding of USAID – the country’s foreign aid administrator – seems to be beyond the scope of presidential powers given its existence is due to an act of Congress. The Democrats letting it slide could set a worrying precedent.\n\nBut Americans do not see foreign aid as a priority. The Democrats fighting to save it could be painted as being out of touch.\n\n“I think at least some leading Democrats may be biding their time and preparing to attack the Trump Administration more strongly when the effect of cuts in programs or downsizing agencies begins to hit,” said Prof Rowland. \n\nIndeed, a number of prominent Democrats, like Pennsylvania senator John Fetterman, have embraced some Trump policies.\n\nProf Rowland cautioned that a full throttled pushback on all of Mr Trump’s actions this early might antagonise Americans. \n\n“I think there is a sense among many voters that Trump won and he should have an opportunity to govern. \n\n“But polling also indicates that many of the proposed actions are deeply unpopular,” he said.\n\n“For many voters, cutting government sounds like a great idea, until they realise the programs being cut help them or their families or friends,” he said. \n\n“This time Trump owns the situation totally. If for example, food prices do not come down, Democrats will point to his promise to cut those prices immediately.”\n\n’Teaspoon to a gun fight’\n\nBut others think the Democrats should go for the jugular now. \n\nAfter Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer stated Democrats weren’t “going to go after every single issue,” Democrat Congressman Chris Murphy criticised the tactic. \n\n“If you let some of these acts of his early days on pass without real protest, it normalises the behaviour,” he said, \n\n“It ends up less likely that you convince anyone to get off the mat later on,” he told The New York Times.\n\nThe Washington bureau chief of progressive website Mother Jones’ David Corn echoed these comments in an opinion piece. \n\n“The Democrats are bringing a teaspoon to a gunfight. \n\n“This is not how a party battling for its survival behaves.”\n\nDemocrats stir\n\nThe Democrats are finally stirring, after several weeks when they seemed paralysed by shock. \n\nThey are becoming more vocal about Elon Musk. They believe there is widespread unease about the power of an unelected tech bro. \n\nMr Trump’s cabinet confirmation votes have also begun to be delayed. There are even fanciful calls for Mr Trump to be impeached – again. \n\nHowever, it’s also likely the Trump administration is itching for a brawl. It wants the Democrats to pick the wrong battle, to look out of touch, and perhaps line up a Supreme Court battle which could swing in the Republicans’ direction. \n\nCertainly, it’s the courts where the most opposition to Mr Trump’s agenda has materialised. \n\nA funding freeze to vulnerable Americans has itself been at least temporarily frozen; plans to move transgender female prisoners to male prisons are on ice over fears they could be harmed, and the administration’s controversial employee buyout program has been halted. \n\nMr Trump’s proposed ban on birthright citizenship could make it to the Supreme Court with a fight over whose interpretation of the Constitution is correct. \n\nProf Rowland said with the Republicans having control over Congress, and few in that party willing to break ranks with Mr Trump, opposition choices were limited. \n\n“The Democrats only real option is to support court cases to block illegal actions.\n\n“And to wait for the policy changes to impact the public and then mount a more aggressive public campaign attacking the Trump Administration.” \n\nAn even more pertinent question than “where are the Democrats?” could be “where are the Republicans?” With a few exceptions, the GOP is in lock step behind Mr Trump. They’re either all on-board the Trump train – or some uncomfortable with the President's’ decisions worried what the effect could be on them if they make their feelings known.","summary":"Donald Trump has been all smiles during his first three weeks.

The two pronouncements bookended a frenetic seven-day period in which Trump also made himself head of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts with creative sway over performances, signed an order banning transgender athletes from competing in women’s sports and cheered on Elon Musk while a cadre of engineers swept into federal agencies to cut staff and programs with an aim to downsize government. Actions are coming at so dizzying a pace that it can be tough to track what Trump has done and what he's turned around and undone. At a news conference Tuesday, Trump said that he would send U.S. troops into Gaza, if need be, to stabilize the bombed-out territory. He backtracked two days later in a social media post. The president imposed 25% tariffs on imports from two U.S. allies, Canada and Mexico on Saturday, Feb. 1. Two days later, he paused the tariffs for a full month. A 25-year-old staff member working with Musk resigned Thursday after being found to have made racist comments online and was rehired the next day. The Denali — or rather, Mt. McKinley-size stack of executive orders gushing from the White House span so many governmental and cultural fronts that disoriented Democrats appear unsure how to fight back. Last month, Senate Democrats had planned a news conference devoted to Trump's blanket pardons of those who took part in the Jan. 6, 2021 riot at the U.S. Capitol. But they scrubbed it focus on a newer outrage: a freeze on trillions of dollars in federal spending. “We are figuring it out,” Jane Kleeb, chair of the Nebraska Democratic Party and a vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, said in an interview. “We don’t have the perfect plan yet.” A strategy at the start of Trump’s first term was to “flood the zone with s---,” as Steve Bannon, Trump’s former White House strategist, memorably described efforts to keep the news media off balance. But the speed at which Trump is moving this time around makes the phrase seem quaint. Trump allies and supporters have embraced a different term: “Shock and awe.” Indeed, an NBC News review shows that Trump signed more executive orders in 10 days than any of his recent predecessors had signed in their first 100 days. The 47th president, Trump, has left the 45th president, Trump, sucking wind. “He [Trump] is delivering on every single campaign promise at a record pace even as the Democrats keep trying to die on hills the American people don’t support them on, e.g., USAID [the U.S. Agency for International Development] funding to export a progressive social agenda out of touch with Main Street America,” Peter Navarro, the administration’s senior counselor for trade and manufacturing, told NBC News. Resistance to Trump’s agenda is coming largely from two places: Democratic elected officials who are waging a fight for public opinion, and lawyers who are battling Trump in the courts. At this point, the lawyers are having far more success. On Friday, a federal judge paused a deadline for the Trump administration to slash the USAID to a few hundred workers, down from 5,000. Meantime, a group of 19 Democratic attorneys general filed suit on Friday to block Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency team from gaining access to personal data including Social Security numbers and bank account information housed at the Treasury Department. A federal judge on Saturday issued a ruling that temporarily blocks Musk’s team from getting access to the data. The judge, Paul Engelmeyer, cited the risk “of the disclosure of sensitive and confidential information and the heightened risk that the systems in question will be more vulnerable than before to hacking.” New Jersey’s attorney general, Matthew Platkin, whose state was among the plaintiffs, told NBC News: “There’s a lot of talk now that President Trump is flooding the zone. That just is a nice-sounding phrase for committing a whole bunch of illegal acts at once.” Platkin said he and his colleagues prepared carefully for Trump’s return to office. They studied his speeches as well as the governing blueprint that some of his past and present appointees drafted in a document called \"Project 2025.\" Trump redux, by contrast, seems to have left Democratic lawmakers shocked, awed and largely ineffectual in their countermoves. “A lot of administrations would measure things based on the first 100 days,” said Tim Murtaugh, a former Trump campaign spokesman. “This administration put points on the scoreboard in the first 100 minutes.” “The Democrats have simply not been able to keep up,” he added. “On Friday, the Democrats will be fighting Tuesday’s battle.” Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the body’s 74-year-old Democratic leader, led a protest against Musk at the Treasury Department on Tuesday. “We will win,” he and his Democratic colleagues chanted. Late night talk show hosts ridiculed the event, airing footage of Schumer together with Rep. Maxine Waters, an 86-year-old California Democrat, as 77-year-old Rep. Al Green of Texas waved his cane in the air. “We need an actual strategy that is more focused on speaking to the everyday voters we lost, in simple and clear terms, and provides some clarity on what we stand for, not just what we oppose,” said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist. “We will not start escaping this painful political wilderness unless we stop repeating the mistakes that got us into this damn mess.\" A common miscalculation of newly elected presidents is the assumption they have a popular mandate. After winning reelection in 2004, George W. Bush sought vainly to revamp the Social Security system. “I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it,” Bush said after defeating Democrat John Kerry. His proposal failed. Trump claimed that his victory last year was a “massive” mandate, though his popular vote margin over Democrat Kamala Harris was just 1.5 percentage points. (By contrast, Joe Biden won the popular vote over Trump by 4.5 percentage points in 2020). Democrats believe that as voters learn more about the spending cuts Musk produces, they’ll recoil and turn on a president who has misread the meaning of his victory. \"There’s been an overreach in trying to stop payments that ordinary Americans rely on,\" Rep. Ro Khanna, D., Calif., said of Trump. \"It’s almost been a reminder to voters that there are things about government that they like, such as their Social Security, Medicaid, and funding for schools in working class neighborhoods.\" Congressional Democrats also believe they have leverage over Trump that may derail his plans. With Republicans holding a slim majority in the House, they need Democratic votes to avert a potential government shutdown next month. Last week, House budget negotiations stalled. \"Not one Democrat will give a vote until there's an ironclad agreement that our appropriations that help people will be spent,\" Khanna said.","summary":"Actions are coming at so dizzying a pace that it can be tough to track what Trump has done and what he's turned around and undone.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/democrats-struggle-trump-dizzying-pace-rcna191009","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-02/250201-trump-ch-1306-0ea2de.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 10:00:00","author":"Jonathan Allen,Peter Nicholas","authors":["Jonathan Allen","Peter Nicholas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.296},{"id":288644572,"title":"Is there a future in politics for Kamala Harris?","text":"Is there a future in politics for Kamala Harris? * WorldNetDaily * by Jesse Watters\n\nSkip to content\n\nIs there a future in politics for Kamala Harris?\n\nBy Jesse Watters\n\nAmerica’s future, Election, Jesse Watters, Kamala Harris, President Donald Trump, US Politics\n\nFeatured articles\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\nIs there a future in politics for Kamala Harris?\n\nJesse Watters\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\nMUST-WATCH NEXT-LEVEL INTERVIEW: Dr. David Martin Issues An Emergency Warning To President Trump\n\nFebruary 9, 2025\n\nVIDEO: Trump Initiates The American Sovereign Wealth Fund","summary":"","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/02/is-there-a-future-in-politics-for-kamala-harris/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/hqdefault-951.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 08:30:25","author":"Jesse Watters","authors":["Jesse Watters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":288606702,"title":"Journalists at LA Times rebel as owner enforces strict measures","text":"Journalists at the Los Angeles Times have launched a fiery rebellion against the publication’s ‘red-pilled’ owner, who recently announced voluntary buyouts to employees.\n\nLA Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, 72, is facing criticism from within his award-winning publication after taking a swipe at his own staffers who feel they’ve worked strenuously to perform with little positive reinforcement, StatusNews reports.\n\nThe traditionally left-leaning publication, headquartered in Los Angeles, has been struggling commercially in recent years due to a decline in readership as Soon-Shiong’s battles to sway employees to ‘buy into’ his vision to cater to readers on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nLast year, the Times slashed over a fifth of its workforce – one of the worst days in the paper’s 142-year history – as it faced nearly $40million in revenue losses.\n\nSoon-Shiong said the loss of over 100 employees ‘was necessary’ as the business is losing $30million to $40million per year.\n\nThe 72-year-old biotech billionaire has since tried to reposition the drowning publication by shifting its political lean to include more right-wing ideology. \n\nIn attempt to do so, Soon-Shiong is expected to roll out a ‘bias meter’ and has also directed the paper’s left-leaning opinion columnists, namely Robin Abacarian, Jackie Calmes and LZ Granderson, to reduce their already marginal output.\n\nThe boss also recently tapped conservative commentator Scott Jennings to serve on the newspaper editorial board. \n\nTensions hit a boiling point when The Free Press ran an explosive interview with Soon-Shiong, where he said ‘dogma’ and ‘false assumptions’ had saturated the outlet over the last few years. He also accused staffers of disguising their personal opinions as fact.\n\nSoon-Shiong revealed he ‘did not believe’ that he had reporters on staff who champion the viewpoint there should be a wall between news and opinion.\n\nThe remarks ignited fury among the company’s journalists, who have just spent weeks tirelessly reporting on the unprecedented wildfire coverage. \n\nAs one staffer told StatusNews reporter Oliver Darcy: ‘People are in disbelief. Patrick’s public comments… were bad enough, but the buyout offer – especially the timing, given how tirelessly the newsroom has been working since the wildfires began – felt tone deaf at best, and spiteful at worst.’ \n\nThe company’s Slack channel quickly ignited with commentary blasting Soon-Shiong for his behavior, according to messages obtained by StatusNews reporter Oliver Darcy.\n\n‘Wouldn’t it be great if he talked to his newsroom even once instead of trashing them in countless other outlets?’ one staffer wrote. \n\n‘His trashing of the newsroom at a moment when you all have done the most spectacular work is really something,’ chimed in another. \n\n‘The whole interview is kind of breathtaking,’ added someone else. \n\n‘Please, for the love of God and Otis Chandler, someone with real power push back on this,’ pleaded a fourth staffer. \n\nIn an email sent to staffers on Monday, the outlet announced voluntary buyouts to employees who have been with the newspaper for two years or more amid changes to move the left-leaning outlet more to the middle.\n\nThe shocking email said that while the paper remains ‘a vital source of news and information for our city, region, state and beyond, the economic landscape of the media industry continues to be extremely challenging. The difficult financial situation faced by the Times requires us to remain diligent in managing costs.’\n\n‘By offering this voluntary buyout program, we aim to provide those of you who may be interested with the flexibility to explore your options,’ the memo said.\n\nThe company-wide buyout offers come after the billionaire owner said last year that he was seeking a better ‘balance’ to the paper’s liberal editorial coverage. \n\nSoon-Shiong also received enormous backlash after he blocked his editorial board from publishing an endorsement for the then-Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris.\n\nThousands of readers later canceled their subscriptions in protest and several members of the editorial board resigned.\n\nSoon-Shion, who acquired the paper in 2018 for $500million, had great hopes for the historic publication when he bought it and claims he has invested over $1billion since the purchase.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJournalists at the Los Angeles Times have launched a fiery rebellion against the publication&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Journalists at LA Times rebel as owner enforces strict measures first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/journalists-at-la-times-rebel-as-owner-enforces-strict-measures/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/02/09/06/95017057-14377189-image-a-49_1739082101571.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-02-09 08:13:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":288619234,"title":"Travis Kelce may be nearing the end but Super Bowl LIX could add to Mr Taylor Swift’s legacy","text":"During the build-up to Super Bowl LIX this weekend, no one’s words have been more heavily scrutinised than Travis Kelce’s. That comes with the territory when you’re Mr Taylor Swift.\n\nBeing in a relationship with the most famous woman on the planet means that when you answer a question about Donald Trump becoming the first sitting US president in history to attend the NFL showpiece, your comments gain traction.\n\n“I think no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life and having the president there… It’s the best country in the world. So, that’d be pretty cool,” Kansas City Chiefs star Kelce said, fairly innocuously, during a press conference earlier this week.\n\nCue online outrage.\n\nSwift’s legion of fans were largely quick to condemn her boyfriend for tacitly supporting the presence of Trump, given the pop megastar’s history with the president.\n\nAhead of November’s US election, Swift endorsed Democratic candidate Kamala Harris as she released a lengthy Instagram post in which she concluded that Harris “fights for the rights and causes I believe”.\n\nShe signed off her post “Taylor Swift, Childless Cat Lady” in a dig at the now vice-president JD Vance, who, in a dig at the then vice-president Harris, had claimed in a 2021 interview that the US was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too”.\n\nTrump, naturally, responded to the endorsement by appearing on Fox News to state that he was “not a fan of Taylor Swift”.\n\nThe spat was one of the many subplots of that election campaign and while it may have been broadly put out of their minds by the wider public, given everything that has happened in American politics since, Swifties never forget – which means it still has resonance in Kelce’s life.\n\nNot that he minds the limelight. In fact, both on and off the field, Kelce seems to thrive in it. In his day job, the 35-year-old is one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history.\n\nA 10-time Pro Bowler and a seven-time All-Pro (four first-team and three second-team selections), he has had more seasons with at least 1,000 receiving yards than any other TE in history and holds the record for most receiving yards in a single season by a player at his position – 1,416 in 2020.\n\nFor a stretch of time, he was simply uncoverable for defensive players – everyone knew that he was Patrick Mahomes’s favourite, and sometimes only, target yet they still couldn’t stop him. When he retires, he will go into the NFL Hall of Fame, likely as a first-ballot pick.\n\nHe has always had a knack for rising to the big occasion. As he hunts a fourth Super Bowl ring with the Chiefs on Sunday evening, he is already safe in the knowledge that he has more career postseason receptions (174), career postseason games with at least 100 receiving yards (nine) and career postseason games with at least one receiving touchdown (15) than any other player, regardless of position, in the history of the NFL.\n\nWhen the light shines brightest, Travis Kelce steps up.\n\nBy his standards, he had a quiet regular season in 2024, amassing 97 catches for 823 yards (at just 8.5 yards per catch) and scoring only three touchdowns – the yardage, yards per catch and touchdown totals being the lowest since his 2013 rookie season when he played just one game.\n\nYet, against the Houston Texans in Kansas City’s play-off opener, he caught seven passes for 117 yards and a touchdown as the Chiefs battled to a 23-14 triumph.\n\nHe is definitely slowing down and his retirement date – enforced or otherwise – may be starting to come into view over the horizon but you’d be a brave person to bet against him having a big impact against the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans on Sunday. \n\nAnd the man himself is adamant that the end is not nigh.\n\n“I want to play as long as I can play,” Kelce said during the Super Bowl media day this week. “It’s months like these that make me feel like I can play forever. I’ve still got a lot of football left in me.”\n\nWhen he does hang up his pads and helmet, Kelce won’t be short of opportunities outside American football. He already has his hugely popular podcast New Heights alongside his brother, former Eagles offensive lineman Jason, which was ranked as the eighth most popular show in the US on Apple Podcasts in 2024.\n\nIn his pre-Taylor Swift era, he was the centre of dating show Catching Kelce on E!, he has hosted Saturday Night Live, and will appear in the upcoming Adam Sandler film Happy Gilmore 2.\n\nOf course, being the boyfriend of Swift also brings a huge amount of media coverage; speculation that he will propose to her at the Super Bowl on Sunday is rife. You can even bet on such an occurrence if you so wish.\n\nOver the past two years, Kelce has become a celebrity beyond the world of American football. However, he’s still got unfinished business within the sport and Super Bowl LIX may prove to be the latest incredible addition to his glittering career CV.","summary":"One of the greatest tight ends in NFL history now picks his moments and winning a fourth Super Bowl ring with the Kansas City Chiefs could be exactly that","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/nfl/super-bowl-travis-kelce-taylor-swift-kansas-city-chiefs-b2694838.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/01/27/10/d84d0ace9c984b1181b2ab0fb9beddb0.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wN19vkMW-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-02-09 08:06:59","author":"Luke Baker","authors":["Luke Baker"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.394},{"id":288591884,"title":"LA Times journalists in mutiny as red-pilled owner launches crackdown","text":"LA Times journalists in mutiny as red-pilled owner launches crackdown\n\nREAD MORE: LA Times slashes its newsroom by ONE FIFTH \n\nBy SAMANTHA RUTT FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 07:17 GMT, 9 February 2025 | Updated: 07:17 GMT, 9 February 2025\n\nJournalists at the Los Angeles Times have launched a fiery rebellion against the publication's 'red-pilled' owner, who recently announced voluntary buyouts to employees.\n\nLA Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, 72, is facing criticism from within his award-winning publication after taking a swipe at his own staffers who feel they've worked strenuously to perform with little positive reinforcement, StatusNews reports.\n\nThe traditionally left-leaning publication, headquartered in Los Angeles, has been struggling commercially in recent years due to a decline in readership as Soon-Shiong's battles to sway employees to 'buy into' his vision to cater to readers on both sides of the political spectrum.\n\nLast year, the Times slashed over a fifth of its workforce - one of the worst days in the paper's 142-year history - as it faced nearly $40million in revenue losses.\n\nSoon-Shiong said the loss of over 100 employees 'was necessary' as the business is losing $30million to $40million per year.\n\nThe 72-year-old biotech billionaire has since tried to reposition the drowning publication by shifting its political lean to include more right-wing ideology. \n\nIn attempt to do so, Soon-Shiong is expected to roll out a 'bias meter' and has also directed the paper's left-leaning opinion columnists, namely Robin Abacarian, Jackie Calmes and LZ Granderson, to reduce their already marginal output.\n\nThe boss also recently tapped conservative commentator Scott Jennings to serve on the newspaper editorial board. \n\nLA Times owner Patrick Soon-Shiong, 72, has launched a series of crackdowns at the award-winning publication in a desperate attempt to revive the struggling news outlet, however his efforts have also welcomed uproar from workers\n\nThe traditionally left-leaning publication, headquartered in Los Angeles, has been struggling commercially in recent years due to a decline in readership due to Soon-Shiong's ongoing battle to get the staff to 'buy into' his vision to cater to readers on both sides of the political spectrum\n\nTensions hit a boiling point when The Free Press ran an explosive interview with Soon-Shiong, where he said 'dogma' and 'false assumptions' had saturated the outlet over the last few years. He also accused staffers of disguising their personal opinions as fact.\n\nSoon-Shiong revealed he 'did not believe' that he had reporters on staff who champion the viewpoint there should be a wall between news and opinion.\n\nThe remarks ignited fury among the company's journalists, who have just spent weeks tirelessly reporting on the unprecedented wildfire coverage. \n\nAs one staffer told StatusNews reporter Oliver Darcy: 'People are in disbelief. Patrick’s public comments... were bad enough, but the buyout offer - especially the timing, given how tirelessly the newsroom has been working since the wildfires began - felt tone deaf at best, and spiteful at worst.' \n\nThe company's Slack channel quickly ignited with commentary blasting Soon-Shiong for his behavior, according to messages obtained by StatusNews reporter Oliver Darcy.\n\n'Wouldn't it be great if he talked to his newsroom even once instead of trashing them in countless other outlets?' one staffer wrote. \n\n'His trashing of the newsroom at a moment when you all have done the most spectacular work is really something,' chimed in another. \n\n'The whole interview is kind of breathtaking,' added someone else. \n\n'Please, for the love of God and Otis Chandler, someone with real power push back on this,' pleaded a fourth staffer. \n\nLA Times opinion writer Robin Abcarian has been asked to reduce her already marginal output at the award-winning publication as part of the company's shift more to the center of the political spectrum. Pictured: Robin Abcarian meets Patrick Soon-Shiong\n\nJackie Calmes, a long-time opinion columnist for the LA Times recieves the Gerald Ford Jounalism Award from former US Vice President Dick Cheney\n\nWhile reducing opinion columnist LZ Granderson's output, Soon-Shiong tapped conservative commentator Scott Jennings to offset the newspaper's left-leaning editorial board\n\nIn an email sent to staffers on Monday, the outlet announced voluntary buyouts to employees who have been with the newspaper for two years or more amid changes to move the left-leaning outlet more to the middle.\n\nThe shocking email said that while the paper remains 'a vital source of news and information for our city, region, state and beyond, the economic landscape of the media industry continues to be extremely challenging. The difficult financial situation faced by the Times requires us to remain diligent in managing costs.'\n\n'By offering this voluntary buyout program, we aim to provide those of you who may be interested with the flexibility to explore your options,' the memo said.\n\nThe company-wide buyout offers come after the billionaire owner said last year that he was seeking a better 'balance' to the paper's liberal editorial coverage. \n\nSoon-Shion, who acquired the paper in 2018 for $500million, had great hopes for the historic publication when he bought it and claims he has invested over $1billion since the purchase\n\nSoon-Shiong also received enormous backlash after he blocked his editorial board from publishing an endorsement for the then-Democratic presidential candidate, Kamala Harris.\n\nThousands of readers later canceled their subscriptions in protest and several members of the editorial board resigned.\n\nSoon-Shion, who acquired the paper in 2018 for $500million, had great hopes for the historic publication when he bought it and claims he has invested over $1billion since the purchase.\n\nLos Angeles\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nLA Times journalists in

Being Distracted by Date with Taylor Swift Before Super Bowl… While Going Against His Own Policy","text":"NFL fans have questioned if Travis Kelce is feeling too complacent about tomorrow’s Super Bowl after he broke his own rules to head out on a double date with Taylor Swift and the Mahomes’.\n\nLast year before the big game in Las Vegas, Kelce shared his strong views on whether or not a player should head out and about in the build-up to the season finale.\n\nSpeaking to millions of listeners on his New Heights podcast, the Chiefs star told his brother Jason: ‘We’ve got one week, we do what we need to do then we can party in Vegas for the rest of our lives.’\n\nBut one year on Kelce has been spotted out for dinner with his girlfriend Swift, quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his wife Brittany – less than 48 hours before the biggest game of his career.\n\nSocial media was flooded with opinions on the surprise outing in New Orleans, with one fan labeling Kelce ‘unfocused’.\n\nAnother added: ‘Bad look. Kelce supposed to be locked in and watching film. I’m sure that outing could have waited.’\n\nA third person said: ‘Normally the players do not go out the week before they are playing in the Super Bowl because of how seriously they take the game, or so I’m told. Even saw an old clip of that Kelce guy saying that.’\n\nPictures emerged late on Friday night of the superstar quartet leaving Lilette, a popular restaurant on New Orleans’ Magazine Street.\n\nAfter word got out of their visit, hundreds of fans had gathered outside, creating a raucous atmosphere as the players and their other halves left to get into cars after their meal.\n\nThe images were also the first of Taylor Swift since she touched down in New Orleans for the big game. It comes a year after she endured a mad dash from her Eras Tour show in Tokyo to Las Vegas on the day of the game.\n\nThis year it appears she is able to take in more of the big game buildup, spending a few days in the city before she is joined by a host of celebrity friends in the Superdome’s VIP suites.\n\nOn Friday night, the pop superstar wore a black dress with matching Larroude Eleonor boots, carrying a bag over her right shoulder.\n\nFriday night’s night out in NOLA comes just days after reports claimed Swift is ‘worried’ that her presence in the city could deflect from Kelce and the Chiefs’ Super Bowl three-peat aims.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Swift wants the game – and the build-up to it – to be all about Kelce and his team, especially if they make history. \n\n‘Taylor doesn’t want to be the center of attention,’ a source was quoted as saying. ‘She just wants to support Travis and help him focus on the game. \n\n‘She wants Travis to enjoy his Super Bowl week experience and be at 110% for Sunday, as she is dreaming about him making Super Bowl history and reaching another dream of his, winning another Super Bowl and making a three-peat.’\n\nIt is unclear whether Swift – and indeed Brittany Mahomes – will see their men again before Sunday, with the players all staying together in a hotel.\n\nThe Chiefs team are staying at the New Orleans Marriott on Canal Street, right in the heart of the city and just one mile away from the 83,000-seater Superdome where Sunday’s game will take place. \n\nAt Friday night’s meal, a beaming Swift looked in fine spirits as she made her way out of the venue in a black dress and matching boots alongside Kelce, despite her die-hard legion of fans being left outraged by his glowing remarks about Trump this week.\n\nThe president, who controversially said he ‘hates’ Taylor in September amid her support for his election rival Kamala Harris, will be at the Superdome for the game.\n\nAnd when asked for his thoughts on Trump attending Sunday’s game, Kelce gushed to reporters that it will be an ‘honor’ to play in front of him despite his bad blood with Swift.\n\n‘That’s awesome. It’s a great honor,’ the Chiefs tight end responded to reporters after being told Trump will be there for the big game.\n\n‘I think you know, no matter who the president is, I know I’m excited because it’s the biggest game of my life, you know, and having the president there — it’s the best country in the world — and that’s pretty cool.’ \n\nMahomes, too, admitted he was excited by the prospect of playing in front of the first ever sitting president at a Super Bowl this weekend.\n\n‘It’s always cool to be able to play in front of a sitting president, someone that is in the top position in our country,’ the quarterback said. ‘I didn’t see that clip but it’s cool to hear that he’s seen me play football and respects the game that I play.’\n\nTravis and Patrick’s positive words about the 78-year-old angered Swifties on social media given his long-running feud with Taylor, who infamously accused him of promoting ‘white supremacy’ and ‘racism’ during his previous reign as president.\n\n‘After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence?’ the songstress wrote on Twitter (X) at the time.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNFL fans have questioned if Travis Kelce is feeling too complacent about tomorrow&#8217;s Super Bowl&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: NFL
