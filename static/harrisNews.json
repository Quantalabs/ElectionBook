In a letter obtained by NPR, Marcus announced her resignation as a columnist and associate editor after four decades of working for the paper. \"Jeff's announcement that the opinion section will henceforth not publish views that deviate from the pillars of individual liberties and free markets threatens to break the trust of readers that columnists are writing what they believe, not what the owner has deemed acceptable,\" Marcus wrote in the resignation letter. Marcus explained further that columnists' freedom to write about whatever topics they choose has been diminished.

Marcus's most recent column was titled \"Trump 2.0: The most damaging first two weeks in presidential history,\" published on February 4th. She argued, \"Trump’s second term is all about curtailing government’s power and reach.\" According to NPR, a spokesperson for the Washington Post sent a statement regarding Marcus’s departure. \"We're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years,\" Marcus said. \"We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\" The Post added. The Post did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. Marcus's departure came after Washington Post owner Bezos recently announced some major changes to the outlet's opinion page. Additionally, he said that the opinion section editor will be stepping down as they introduce the changes.

Bernie Sanders, at least he’s consistent.\n\nThe octogenarian lawmaker opened a rally in Milwaukee Friday with a performance by transgender musician Laura Jane Grace, who belted out profane lyrics like “Does your god have a big fat d–k? Cause it feels like he’s f–king me.”\n\nIt was the same sort of gleeful transgression-for-transgression’s-sake display that leftists have been reveling in for years — and at total odds with the attempts of others in Sanders’ caucus to adopt a less extreme tone.\n\nMonths after Donald Trump dispatched them with relative ease, Democrats are still searching for a remedy to their self-inflicted wounds.\n\nOn Sunday, Sen. Andy Kim (D-NJ) struggled to make sense of his vote against a bill protecting the integrity of women’s sports, in light of California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s recent flip-flop on the issue.\n\n“We want to make sure that these decisions are made . . . by the communities, by the schools,” Kim stammered.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) tried the same excuse.\n\n“Republicans in Washington are saying they know better than parents and local school districts,” Baldwin complained.\n\nIsn’t it interesting how national Democrats and their heavy, power-hungry hands suddenly go limp when they’re on the wrong side of an 80-20 issue?\n\nThe Baldwin-Kim method of dancing around their party’s near-religious insistence that men can become women and vice-versa only insults those it’s meant to persuade.\n\nFor years now, Democrats have staked out incomprehensible positions that have Americans questioning not just their judgment, but their sanity.\n\nA mealy-mouthed deathbed conversion to federalism won’t cut it as a walkback.\n\nWhich brings us to Newsom and his attempted political makeover in anticipation of his inevitable 2028 presidential bid.\n\nThe project is a galling one.\n\nFor the better part of a decade, Newsom has been at the forefront of the progressive movement, embracing — and, when possible, implementing — every aspect of the far-left agenda en vogue in the Democratic Party.\n\nAnd yet, on the debut episode of his new podcast, Newsom made news not for fiercely defending his long-held positions, but articulating completely new ones.\n\nIn one striking moment, Newsom called the participation of biological males in female sports “deeply unfair.”\n\nIn others, Newsom scoffed at the progressive “Defund the Police” campaign, distanced himself from the term “Latinx,” and mocked the practice of announcing one’s pronouns.\n\nWho is he kidding?\n\nThe governor has spent years going to bat for the same causes he now claims to disdain.\n\nNewsom has railed against conservatives for rejecting the bizarre, paternalistic “Latinx” craze, barred Golden State school districts from notifying parents when their children change pronouns, and just last year proposed nearly $200 million in cuts to state law-enforcement budgets.\n\nHis position on men in women’s sports was previously unmistakable: In 2021, he announced that his state wouldn’t go “backwards on these issues.”\n\nIf he’s really changed his mind, he can throw his weight behind one of two bills now in the California legislature that would demonstrate as much— but until he does, his empty words can be written off as cheap talk.\n\nThe episode underscores a larger problem for Newsom’s party.\n\nEver since Donald Trump’s first shocking defeat of Hillary Clinton, Democrats have responded not by reevaluating their priors, but by adopting more and more extreme positions.\n\nIn 2018, 2020 and 2022, Trump’s unpopularity proved powerful enough to help them either carry the day or fight to a draw.\n\nBut in 2024, Trump successfully capitalized on four years of absurdity sponsored by the Biden administration.\n\nNotably, many of the Trump campaign’s most effective attacks on Kamala Harris pertained to the crazy-to-the-point-of-sounding-made-up ideas she had promoted during her last presidential campaign: 80% tax rates, the Green New Deal, free sex-change surgeries for illegal immigrants and more.\n\nHarris, sensing the ground beneath her feet had shifted, tried to backpedal — but fearing the progressive activist class she had once indulged, she couldn’t bring herself to so much as feign a genuine about-face, resorting instead to half-baked equivocations issued through surrogates.\n\nShe prioritized the wants of those who sang along at the Sanders rally over those of persuadable, middle-of-the-road voters.\n\nGive him credit, Newsom has the right idea.\n\nThe only way he can earn back Americans’ trust is by directly repudiating himself — and his own policies.\n\nBut the chances of that rebrand succeeding are hampered by reality.\n\nThe ambitious governor is just one member of an entire generation of Democrats who have spent their entire careers championing woke excesses — until Trump’s second victory convinced them they’d have to recalibrate.\n\nIt’ll take a lot more than a few empty words to undo the damage and convince the American people that their faux moderation isn’t just that.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"The

greater crash’ as Trump tariffs incinerate stock market","text":"A Fox News guest predicted that there could be an “even greater crash” of the stock market as it continued to plummet on Monday. \n\nThe stock market continued to tumble on Monday as the S&P 500 dropped 2.7%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 890 points and the Nasdaq composite slid by 4%. Fox News guest Jonathan Kott said on Monday that it could get even worse as President Donald Trump’s administration gives mixed messages on the economy. \n\n“If you have different people in the administration giving different messages, I mean the Commerce Secretary and the President are having different messages on the same day, that’s not giving the market any sort of ease or certainty for investors. So I wouldn’t be surprised if we have an even greater crash,” Kott said. \n\nThe stock market drop comes months after Trump suggested that the stock market would “crash” if former Vice President Kamala Harris was elected to the White House. \n\n“We are going to have a crash and we’re going to have a crash like a 1929 crash if she gets in,” he said in August 2024. \n\nTrump has repeatedly blamed poor economic numbers on former President Joe Biden. The White House downplayed the stock market numbers in a statement to the press pool on Monday. \n\n“Want to emphasize that we’re seeing a strong divergence between animal spirits of the stock market and what we’re actually seeing unfold from businesses and business leaders, and the latter is obviously more meaningful than the former on what’s in store for the economy in the medium to long term,” the official said, according to Reuters.\n\nIt was the worst day yet in a scary stretch where the S&P 500 has swung more than 1%, up or down, seven times in eight days because of Trump’s on -and- off -again tariffs. The worry is that the whipsaw moves will either hurt the economy directly or create enough uncertainty to drive U.S. companies and consumers into an economy-freezing paralysis. \n\nThe economy has already given some signals of weakening, mostly through surveys showing increased pessimism. And a widely followed collection of real-time indicators compiled by the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta suggests the U.S. economy may already be shrinking. \n\nAsked over the weekend whether he was expecting a recession in 2025, Trump told Fox News Channel: “I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition because what we’re doing is very big. We’re bringing wealth back to America. That’s a big thing.” He then added, “It takes a little time. It takes a little time.” \n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report. \n\nOur journalism needs your support.

The importing business could be any American company that purchases goods from foreign suppliers and brings them into the country for resale, manufacturing or distribution. Tariffs are often used to protect domestic industries by making foreign goods more expensive and encouraging consumers to buy locally.Trump recently implemented 25 percent tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, along with a 10 percent increase in tariffs on Chinese goods. The three countries announced retaliatory measures in response. But Trump on Thursday announced a one-month pause on tariffs on Canada and Mexico products covered by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) free trade treaty.What To KnowIn a Monday post to X, formerly Twitter, Rollins said she met with Mexico's Secretary of Agriculture and Rural Development Julio Berdegué and they discussed the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship.Rollins added that she expressed concern over Mexico's proposed constitutional amendment that would ban genetically modified (GM) corn.\"We both expressed the importance of the U.S.-Mexico trade relationship for our great U.S. agricultural products. Tariffs were a top priority for this conversation. In the past 20 years, U.S. exports to Mexico have increased 220%, but our imports from Mexico grew by over 450%. We need Mexico to import more of our products for a reciprocal trading relationship,\" Rollins said.She added: \"I expressed my concern to Secretary Berdegué that Mexico's proposed constitutional amendment on biotech corn should not result in restrictions on U.S. corn exports for food or animal feed use in Mexico. He assured me that there is no intention to block trade. I look forward to building on our relationship.\"Rollins' remarks come after Mexico's lower house of Congress late last month passed a sweeping constitutional reform to ban the planting of GM corn, a move that analysts warn could reignite trade tensions with the United States.A map created by Newsweek shows the states that would be most impacted if Mexico follows through with its proposed ban.According to Brownfield News, Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Kansas and Louisiana are the top corn exporters to Mexico. All of the states except Illinois backed Trump for president in 2024, as the Prairie State favored former Vice President Kamala Harris.Mexico is a major buyer of U.S. corn, importing about $5 billion worth of GM corn annually, primarily for livestock feed, according to Reuters.With 95 percent of Mexico's corn imports coming from the United States—where most corn is genetically modified—the reform is poised to have significant trade implications. Yellow corn, mainly used for the livestock feed and in other industries including processed food production, plays a critical role in the agricultural supply chain.But Mexico remains self-sufficient in white corn production, a staple food for its 129 million citizens.The GM corn ban, championed by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, follows a December ruling by a trade-dispute panel under the USMCA, which found Mexico's restrictions on GM corn imports to be in violation of the agreement. In response, Mexico lifted its import restrictions on GM corn for human, livestock and industrial use.Mexico, widely regarded as the birthplace of modern corn, had long barred the commercial planting of GM corn, citing concerns that such strains could contaminate the country's native varieties.But Sheinbaum's latest reform goes further by embedding the ban into Mexico's Constitution. The legislation, approved by a decisive 409-69 vote, designates native corn as an \"element of national identity\" and prohibits the planting of GM corn nationwide.The legislation was also approved 97-16 in the Senate last week.The Agricultural Markets Consulting Group, a prominent consultancy in Mexico, previously warned that the new legislation could create \"uncertainty\" in trade relations with the U.S.What People Are SayingThe text of Mexico's reform states: \"Any other use of genetically modified corn must be evaluated ... to be free of threats to the biosecurity, health and biocultural heritage of Mexico and its population.\"The Agricultural Markets Consulting Group said in a recent report, per Reuters: \"Following the adverse ruling by the USMCA dispute panel, the insistence on these restrictions is likely to trigger retaliatory measures by the US government.\"What Happens NextThe measure must now be approved by the local legislatures of at least 17 of the country's 32 states, where the ruling Morena party has a majority.","summary":"U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins raised concern over Mexico's proposed constitutional amendment that would ban genetically modified corn.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-states-most-impacted-if-mexico-passes-corn-constitutional-amendment-2042516","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2604165/brooke-rollins.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 22:08:05","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.157},{"id":298794032,"title":"Pritzker to speak to New Hampshire Democrats about dangers of second Trump administration","text":"Gov. JB Pritzker will speak before New Hampshire Democrats next month to highlight the dangers of President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s hacks to the federal government.\n\nThe Democratic governor has not yet announced whether he’ll seek a third term for governor, and he has consistently tamped down talk of his presidential aspirations. But for now, Pritzker is depicting himself as a leader of the Democratic resistance against Trump, and his national appearances have focused on standing up to authoritarianism.\n\nPritzker will headline the New Hampshire Democratic Party’s McIntyre-Shaheen 100-Club Dinner on April 27 in Manchester. Pritzker’s team said the fundraiser is one of several speaking invitations he’s received so far this year. He plans to focus on the threat of Medicaid cuts, the impacts of Musk’s federal government gutting, and its impact on everyday Americans, aides said. \n\nThe Democratic governor has upped his national media exposure this year, including interviews on ABC’s “The View,” CNN and MSNBC, as well as appearances on popular podcasts, including “The Blueprint with Jen Psaki,” “American Fever Dream,” and “Raging Moderates.”\n\nIn his joint State of the State and budget address last month, Pritzker claimed he isn’t sounding the alarm because of his “ambitions,” but more so because of a moral obligation. \n\n“My oath is to the Constitution of our state and of our country. We don’t have kings in America, and I don’t intend to bend the knee to one,” Pritzker said. I am not speaking up in service to my ambitions — but in deference to my obligations.”\n\nThe Democratic governor spoke before the New Hampshire Democrats in June 2022, which sparked speculation of a White House bid. At the time, Pritzker aides tried to quell the talk of presidential aspirations, saying the trip was intended to help support Democrats in their fight for reproductive rights. \n\nPrior to 2024, New Hampshire served as the first-in-the-nation primary and Iowa served as the first-in-the-nation caucuses. But last year, Democrats opted to give South Carolina the top spot, followed by Nevada, Georgia and Michigan, in an effort to give diverse populations more of an early voice in the long slog of an election year. A new primary calendar — which helps determine where presidential candidates must spend their money and time — is something the Democratic National Committee will explore for the 2028 cycle.\n\nPritzker was on a shortlist of Democrats under consideration to join Kamala Harris campaign as her vice presidential pick, but Harris ultimately chose Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. \n\nThe Illinois governor is expected to make a decision about a third term in the coming months.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/politics/2025/03/10/jb-pritzker-new-hampshire-democrats-speech-donald-trump","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/554af1b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4032x2302+0+361/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F3b%2F76%2F36d433edc93f94c80c2e708ee813%2Fprit","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 21:58:29","author":"Tina Sfondeles","authors":["Tina Sfondeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":298795888,"title":"Senators launch bipartisan effort to allow benefits for families of fallen retired police officers","text":"FIRST ON FOX: A bipartisan pair of senators are teaming up to pass \"commonsense legislation\" that ensures the families of former law enforcement officers who are killed in retirement are protected by benefits. Sens. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Catherine Cortez Masto, D-Nev., introduced the Chief Herbert D. Proffitt Act, shared first with Fox News Digital, on Monday to amend the Public Safety Officers’ Benefits Program and make families of former law enforcement officers eligible to receive benefits if the former officer is killed or permanently disabled after retirement. The legislation is named after Chief Herbert D. Proffitt, a retired officer who was shot and killed in his driveway by someone he had arrested decades prior. GOP SENATOR REVEALS STRATEGY TO PUSH TRUMP'S POLICIES THROUGH CONGRESS: ‘I BELIEVE IN THE AGENDA’ Despite serving in law enforcement for 55 years, Proffitt's family members were denied benefits since he had retired prior to the attack. \"When a law enforcement officer is killed because of the work they did to keep our communities safe, it’s our responsibility to make sure their family is cared for,\" Cortez Masto, a former law enforcement official, said in a statement. \"I’m proud to introduce this critical piece of commonsense legislation to right the wrong Chief Proffitt’s family experienced and make sure it doesn’t happen to anyone else.\" The amendment would also apply to claims by former law enforcement officers who retired on or after Jan. 1, 2012. EX-DEM SENATOR JON TESTER LINKS HIS 2024 LOSS TO KAMALA HARRIS' POOR PERFORMANCE IN HIS STATE \"The loss of Chief Herbert D. Proffitt is a tragic reminder of the risk that follows our finest every day of their lives,\" McConnell said in a statement shared with Fox News Digital. \"This legislation plugs an important hole, ensuring the Proffitt family – and others like them – are supported and assured that the service and sacrifice of their loved ones are never forgotten,\" the senator said. The bill is endorsed by several police advocacy groups, including the Fraternal Order of Police, the Nevada Association of Public Safety Officers, the Kentucky Sheriffs’ Association, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Foundation and Supporting Heroes.

Tim Walz, the failed 2024 vice presidential candidate, conducted a postmortem on his 2024 campaign with former Vice President Kamala Harris, determining the Democrats played it too safe during the cycle. \"We shouldn’t have been playing this thing so safe,\" Walz told Politico in an interview published Saturday. He added: \"I think we probably should have just rolled the dice and done the town halls, where (voters) may say, ‘You’re full of s---, I don’t believe in you.' I think there could have been more of that.\" Walz joined Harris on the Democratic ticket in August 2024, just days after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race in July amid mounting concerns over the commander in chief's mental acuity and as Harris moved to pick up the mantle at the top of the ticket. The Harris campaign had just more than 100 days between Biden dropping out and rallying support for the Harris-Walz ticket on Nov. 5. FAILED VP CANDIDATE TIM WALZ SKEWERED AFTER HINTING AT POTENTIAL 2028 PRESIDENTIAL RUN The Trump-Vance ticket swept the battleground states on election night, catapulting them to victory with 312 electoral votes to Harris’ 226. Walz has been on a media blitz in recent days, including speaking with the New Yorker, joining MSNBC ahead of President Donald Trump's address to a joint session of Congress, speaking at the South By Southwest film festival on Saturday and teeing up an interview on California Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s podcast. TIM WALZ SAYS LOSING PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IS 'PURE HELL,' ADMITS DEMS ARE 'FATIGUED' IN MSNBC INTERVIEW Walz argued that Democrats \"are more cautious\" in engaging with the media than Republicans, while adding that he felt as if the campaign was never ahead, comparing it to a \"prevent defense\" strategy during a football game. \"In football parlance, we were in a prevent defense to not lose when we never had anything to lose because I don’t think we were ever ahead,\" he said, which bolsters reporting following the election that internal Democratic polling showed Harris lagging behind Trump in the lead-up to Nov. 5. Walz took ownership for the party's loss in 2024, telling the outlet that \"when you’re on the ticket and you don’t win, that’s your responsibility.\" TIM WALZ ADMITS HE WAS SURPRISED BY ELECTION DEFEAT: ‘THOUGHT THE COUNTRY WAS READY’ A handful of former presidential campaign staffers who spoke to the outlet under the condition of anonymity relayed that Walz wasn't presented to voters in an effective manner, and was instead kept in a \"box,\" which they said compounded the Harris–Walz loss to the Trump–Vance ticket. \"He was underutilized and that was the symptom of the larger campaign of decision paralysis and decision logjam at the top,\" one former senior Harris aide told the outlet. \"Could he have changed a percent in Wisconsin? Maybe. We still lose even if we win Wisconsin.\" Walz was put \"in a box,\" and \"we didn’t use him the way we could’ve,\" the aide added. \"The world seemed to want more Tim Walz, and there were times when I wish they could’ve gotten more Tim Walz,\" Democratic Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said, adding that he \"wished they would’ve put [Walz] out there more.\" TIM WALZ THOUGHT HIS LACK OF WEALTH WAS ‘REAL FLEX’ AGAINST TRUMP: ‘HOW… DID WE LOSE TO A BILLIONAIRE?’ \"By the time they finally let him do anything at all, it’s like 20 days left, and he’s doing four states a day, and there’s only so much you could do,\" another former staffer said of Walz. \"It was too short.\" The aides argued that Walz faced a steep battle ahead of his debate against then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance, remarking that he was \"super nervous\" and \"in his own head\" while preparing to face the Trump running mate on the stage. \"It looked as if Vance was the conductor and Walz was following the script,\" longtime Democrtic strategist David Axelrod told Politico of the VP debate. \"I don’t think that was the reason they lost, but that was not helpful either.\" 'DOOMED': EXPERTS SAY THIS CRUCIAL CAMPAIGN DECISION LED TO VP HARRIS' 'DISASTROUS' DEFEAT Walz reportedly carried campaign flubs heavily on his mind, while some aides argued that the Harris campaign \"didn’t do enough to punch back\" against criticisms and defend Walz, such as when he falsely claimed he carried guns while in war. Walz joined the Army National Guard in 1981 and retired in 2005, but never saw combat. \"This was a guy who definitely was embarrassed by his flubs, didn’t handle them well, and seemed like there was a never-ending supply of them, so that was part of the issue of getting him out there everywhere,\" a former Harris staffer told Politico. \"I don’t look back on that campaign and think that the way we used Walz was a critical error.\" Walz revealed in an interview with the New Yorker, published March 2, that he is open to a potential presidential run in 2028, which was met with mockery by conservatives on social media earlier in March. Walz reiterated in his Politico interview that he is \"not saying no\" to a potential 2028 presidential run if the opportunity should present itself. \"I’m staying on the playing field to try and help because we have to win,\" Walz said. \"And I will always say this, I will do everything in my power [to help], and as I said, with the vice presidency, if that was me, then I’ll do the job.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to Walz's office for additional comment on his remarks and did not immediately receive a reply.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

The group touted its fundraising for each night of the Democratic National Convention — $13 million on Day One, $16.5 million on Day Two, $23 million on Day Three, and $37 million on Day Four. \n\nSo ActBlue is an important part of the Democratic machine. And now something appears to have gone terribly wrong. \n\nLast week, the New York Times reported that at least seven senior ActBlue officials have resigned in recent days, with the suggestion that the resignations might be related to the actions of a whistleblower inside the organization. The New York Times cited an angry letter sent by two unions who said the departures are “eroding our confidence in the stability of the organization.” According to the letter, cited by the New York Times, ActBlue’s customer service director, partnerships director, associate general counsel, assistant research director, and chief revenue officer, plus an engineer and human resources official, all left.\n\nNobody will say a word to reporters. But then came one additional piece of information. A man named Zain Ahmad, who the New York Times said is the “last remaining lawyer in the ActBlue general counsel’s office,” wrote an internal message saying that his access to email and other communications had been cut off. He is now apparently on leave. And then, according to the New York Times, Ahmad wrote, “Please be advised that we have Anti-Retaliation and Whistleblower Policies for a reason.” That seems to suggest Ahmad is saying he is being retaliated against for blowing the whistle on something that led to the mass exodus. But we don’t know.\n\nNow, the House Oversight Committee chairman, Rep. James Comer (R-KY), the man who uncovered much of the Biden family’s shady financial dealings, and House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil (R-WI) have written a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggesting they are probing ActBlue’s activities. \n\nThe two committees “are investigating reports of potentially fraudulent and illicit financial activity related to contributions to campaigns of candidates for federal offices facilitated by online fundraising platforms like ActBlue,” Comer and Steil wrote. Of particular concern, they added, are “recent reports suggesting fraud and evasion of campaign finance law by individuals exploiting online contribution platforms, especially ActBlue.”\n\nComer and Steil want the Treasury to show them documents known as suspicious activity reports. The two asked the Biden Treasury Department for the information months ago but were only allowed to review “limited documents.” They’re now requesting the Treasury Department, under Republican control, to provide the rest.\n\nOne last thing that may or may not be related to anything: In recent days, Elon Musk, head of the Department of Government Efficiency effort, has suggested that ActBlue-funded groups are behind violent protests at Tesla dealerships. It’s not clear precisely what Musk is alleging; at this point, his message seems to be, as he posted on Friday, “Something stinks about ActBlue.”\n\nAt this point, nothing is clear. But something is going on at ActBlue, and Comer and a few others are on to it. \n\nIn the bigger picture, it is one more problem for a Democratic Party that is beset by problems right now. Stunned by the events of 2024, the party doesn’t really know what it is or what it wants to be. Most importantly, it does not know how to deal with President Donald Trump. And now it is going to have to deal with congressional investigators too.","summary":"WHAT&#8217;S GOING ON WITH ACTBLUE? The Democratic fundraising platform ActBlue was created more than 20 years ago, in 2004, at a time when Democrats were up in arms over another Republican president, George W.

The pardons all reportedly indicated that they were signed \"at the City of Washington.\"\n\n This discovery, coupled with the former president's \n alleged admission to House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) that he did not remember signing a January 2024 order to pause decisions on exports of liquefied natural gas, prompted the Oversight Project to once again cast doubt on whether Biden was ever calling the shots and to suggest that \"WHOEVER CONTROLLED THE AUTOPEN CONTROLLED THE PRESIDENCY.\"\n\n Critics, enraged by yet another indication that unelected ideologues may have secretly controlled the executive branch for the past four years, are now questioning the legitimacy of the documents bearing the autopen signature.\n\n 'All those orders are void.'\n\n Seeking definitive answers, Missouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey \n wrote to the Department of Justice last week requesting a full investigation into the legality of Biden's presidential actions in light of his apparent mental decline, which was especially clear to special counsel Robert Hur, who figured Biden as possibly too senile to charge.\n\n \"Under the 25th Amendment, his inability to make decisions should have meant a succession of power,\" Bailey noted in his letter. \"Instead, it appears staffers and officers in the Biden administration may have exploited Biden's incapacity so they could issue orders without an accountable President of sound mind approving them.\"\n\n President Donald Trump told Blaze Media co-founder \n Glenn Beck in October that Joe Biden was likely little more than a figurehead for a \"committee\" of unnamed bureaucrats.\n\n Lindy Li, a former Democratic strategist and fundraiser who served as a surrogate for failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris and worked for the 2020 Biden campaign, recently shed some light on potential members of that supposed committee. Li \n told podcaster Shawn Ryan last month that Hunter Biden, Jill Biden, and a handful of other unelected senior advisers effectively served as a combined shadow president.\n\n Missouri Attorney General Bailey suggested that a number of pardons Biden supposedly signed were suspicious, including the unconditional 10-year pardon Biden \n supposedly gave his son after repeatedly vowing he would not do so and just months after declaring without qualification, \"No one is above the law.\"\n\n \"It is black-letter law that a document is void, ab initio, when the person signing it lacks mental capacity,\" wrote Bailey. \"Staffers and the Vice President cannot constitutionally evade accountability by laundering far-left orders through a man who does not know what he is signing. If in fact this has been occurring, then all those orders are void.\"\n\n The Oversight Project \n suggested that in order to determine whether Biden ordered the signing of key documents or was even mentally capable of doing so, investigators must \"determine who controlled the autopen and what checks there were in place.\"\n\n The watchdog group further indicated that Biden's \n work to undermine the White House executive privilege shield will make such determinations achievable.\n\n \"There is a constitutional process to deal with an incapacitated POTUS and it doesn't contemplate giving someone else his autopen and authority,\" \n tweeted Howell. \"It's called the 25th Amendment and the conspiracy not to invoke it in order to keep whatever they were doing going is a big problem.\"\n\nThe New York Post indicated that representatives for Biden had not responded to requests for comment regarding the use of the autopen.\n\nLike Blaze News?

Trump is famous for defying political gravity, but even for him, this was unprecedented. It was as if the American people had suffered from collective amnesia and forgotten January 6, the COVID pandemic, and the Black Lives Matter protests. Not only that, it was the first time in 20 years a Republican won the popular vote in the presidential elections. Once again, American voters were angry, once again American voters wanted change, once again American voters bafflingly considered Trump—who had been president once before—to be the outsider.\nBut there was another important data point, which may not be getting enough attention. A lot of voters were angry about a very specific thing: inflation. The idea that things were suddenly more expensive for no discernible reason was a hard pill for voters to swallow. A month before the election, Gallup reported that the economy “could be a significant factor to nine in 10 voters.” Voters were angry, but most weren’t angry about government spending—they were angry about the price of eggs. If you were to argue that Trump has a mandate, and he would argue that he does, it would be to make prices lower.\nTrump promised many pie-in-the-sky things. For example, he said that if he won, the government or insurance companies would cover the cost of in vitro fertilization treatment—a proposal that would almost certainly never fly with his own party. After taking office, Trump is still promising some of these fantastical things. During his speech to a joint session of Congress earlier this month, he reiterated his call to eliminate taxes on tips, overtime, and Social Security benefits—once again, costly ideas that would almost certainly never jell with the Republican Party he leads.\nBut Trump’s biggest, boldest campaign promise was downright impossible. It was a promise that Kamala Harris couldn’t make because there was no way to do it. Trump vowed to immediately reverse inflation and to immediately make things cheaper. In August he told a crowd in Montana: “Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again, to bring down the prices of all goods.” And in October, he told a group in Wisconsin: “Starting on day one, we will end inflation and make America affordable again. We’ll do that.” Harris couldn’t promise that because, even with the most aggressive government intervention, there is no realistic way to do it.\nBut instead of bringing prices down on day one, or even month one, Trump is doing the exact opposite. He’s enacted a trade war and let Elon Musk take a chainsaw to the federal government, both of which have caused market uncertainty. Suddenly, the man who said he was going to make everything cheaper on day one can’t even rule out a recession on his watch, and has instead mused about a “period of transition.”\nTrump has it in his head that the United States was somehow richer before income taxes, which is fueling his tariff obsession. A few days after being sworn in, he told reporters in the Oval Office: “We were at our richest from 1870 to 1913. That’s when we were a tariff country. And then they went to an income tax concept.” It makes sense that Trump, a real estate baron, would be nostalgic for the Gilded Age—after all, it was a time in American life marked by high concentration of wealth, vast income inequality, and widespread political corruption.\nBut the problem is that while Trump loves tariffs, no one else does. His back-and-forth on implementing them has spooked the markets, because the only thing the markets like less than tariffs is uncertainty.\nEven after a week of poor market reactions to Trump’s will-he-won’t-he on tariff threats, he has continued to seesaw on the topic. On Sunday, during a friendly interview, Trump told Fox News that “the tariffs could go up as time goes by,” dismissed calls for more “predictability,” and refused to rule out a recession. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick further rationalized the volatility, telling NBC’s Meet the Press, “Will there be distortions? Of course. Foreign goods may get a little more expensive, but American goods are going to get cheaper.” Meanwhile, all markets want is stability, and this was probably not what they wanted to hear: US stocks saw a steep sell-off Monday morning.\nIt seems pretty clear that Trump is simply not laser-focused on the only promise anyone could legitimately view as his mandate: making things cheaper.\nIn November 2024, voters perceived the economy to be bad despite underlying fundamentals being good. They yet again voted for change. Trump promised cheaper groceries through tariffs, which ultimately make things more expensive. Since Trump took office seven weeks ago, the S&P has dropped 5%. And guess what? Groceries are not cheaper.\nTrump has been able to defy political gravity many times. He’s come back from scandals that would have ended most political careers. But the question is, what happens when a president ends up doing the exact opposite of what he promised voters he’d do?","summary":"The president vowed to bring down prices on “day one”—something everyone would like to see.

This time around I am choosing to prioritize my young children and the private life we are creating as a family. I do not plan to be involved in politics,” she stated in a 2022 social media post. \n\nEarlier this year, as her father transitioned back to the White House, the first daughter reiterated those feelings. \n\n“I love policy and impact. I hate politics and unfortunately, the two are not separable,” Ivanka told The Skinny Confidential Him & Her podcast in January. “There’s a darkness in that world that I don’t really want to welcome into mine.”\n\nFor someone who hates the “darkness in that world,” Ivanka sure has enjoyed the spotlight near her father and at his events in recent months. The Republican National Convention, Election Night and the recent Joint Address to Congress are three examples of her recent appearances near her father- despite her resentment of politics. \n\nThe most recent appearance was this week at her father’s joint congressional address alongside her husband, Jared Kushner. The 43-year-old sat in the president’s box to watch the address, alongside First Lady Melania Trump and her siblings Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Tiffany Trump. \n\nOther guests in the box included Elon Musk, Second Lady Usha Vance and the family of Corey Comperatore, a firefighter killed by would-be assassin Thomas Crooks at Trump’s July campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania last year. \n\nNotably absent was Barron Trump, the president’s youngest son. The 18-year-old New York University skipped the address because he had classes scheduled this week, The Daily Mail reported. \n\nIvanka shared an Instagram post chronicling her attendance with the caption, “48 hours in DC!” Hours later, she shared another post highlighting the outfit she wore to the address designed by Oscar de la Renta.\n\n“Thank you, @oscardelarenta, for the exquisite navy blue tweed suit with orchid appliqués,” she wrote. “Hair, makeup + photos by my dear friend @alexarodulfo (apparently I’m an ambi-turner … Serving right angles only in full Zoolander style).”\n\nBut, her father’s Congressional address is not the only political event that Ivanka has been pictured at in recent months. After not being seen around her father for months, she attended the 2024 Republican National Convention, taking a picture with her father as he signed his official nomination paperwork. That was days after an assassin tried to take Donald’s life.\n\n“Thank you for your love and prayers for my father and for the other victims of today’s senseless violence in Butler, Pennsylvania,” Ivanka wrote on social media shortly after the shooting. \n\n“I am grateful to the Secret Service and all the other law enforcement officers for their quick and decisive actions today. I continue to pray for our country,” she added. “I love you Dad, today and always.”\n\nDays later, Ivanka was on stage with her father in Milwaukee for the Republican National Convention.\n\nWhile not appearing on the campaign trail with her dad, Ivanka was around him on Election Day. She was spotted at Mar-a-Lago and attended the Election Night party. Later, she was on stage with her father and the rest of her family as the Republican nominee declared victory over then-vice president Kamala Harris. \n\nIvanka didn’t speak to the crowd or the press that night, but could be seen smiling as her father reveled about returning to the White House. \n\nIn January, Ivanka and Kushner also attended Donald’s inauguration and the subsequent celebration events in January. She wore a green dress and hat to see her father be sworn in again on Inauguration Day. Later, she and her husband were alongside her father, and new president, at the Liberty Inaugural Ball. \n\nA month later, Ivanka wasn’t with her dad in the nation’s capital. Instead, she was by his side as he became the first sitting president to attend the Super Bowl. She had a prime seat at her father’s right hand as the family watched the Philadelphia Eagles beat the Kansas City Chiefs. \n\nWeeks after that, she was back in his obit. This time for the address to Congress.\n\nDespite Ivanka calling the presidency the “world’s loneliest position,” she has been spotted by his side at several points in the last few months. While first saying she plans to support her father through non-political activities, she has been at some high-profile political moments. \n\nThe Independent has contacted the Trump Organization for comment about her appearances. \n\nIn January – well before she was spotted in his orbit – Ivanka discussed the difference from her first term and her hopes for her role in the second - even if she seemingly is more around than planned. \n\n“We were like the Pioneers, nobody really knew what to do with him as a political figure,” Ivanka told the January podcast about her father’s first term. “Now there are so many people around. I think about in this moment how I can also support him because I know what the job is, like in a very personal way, having been by his side for four years.”\n\n“I think I’m most looking forward to just being able to show up for him as a daughter and be there for him to take his mind off things, to watch a movie with him, or watch a sports game,” she added. “To know that he can be with me, and be himself and just relax and for me to be able to provide that for him in a very loving way as his daughter.”","summary":"Ivanka has said she ‘hates’ politics and plans to stay away from the White House during her father’s second term","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ivanka-trump-donald-politics-appearances-events-b2712509.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/07/13/05/Ivanka-Trump-at-differents-President-Donald-Trumps-events-in-2025.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TFmEThlG-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-10 20:09:45","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.224},{"id":298764526,"title":"The Online Doechii Hate Is Unwarranted","text":"Doechii’s post-Alligator Bites Never Heal ascendance into rap stardom isn’t a new dynamic. But it’s been a while since we’ve seen a rap-star ascendance that’s not paired with controversial allegations, a zest for riling the public into social engagement, or dog whistling to incels. Her appeal is mostly based on her music, savvy creative direction, and considerable charisma. Watching her rise feels like a return to a bygone era of the music industry that Gen Z fans have never seen in a hip-hop context. Maybe that’s why some are so skeptical about her.\n\n If the disdain is strictly about not liking the music, that’s fine. No one has to enjoy everything. But the loudest online discourse feels more like projections of misogyny, queerphobia, colorism, and a fundamental misunderstanding of how the industry works. She’s often faced commenters calling her an industry plant, an attack that popped up again this weekend when a clip from a recent First We Feast appearance went viral. \n\n In the video, Doechii tells her DJ, Miss Milan, that a dating red flag for her is “straight men,” which outraged the men that idolize rappers who routinely call women everything but a child of god. She was accused of being a part of an anti-male agenda. Some surmised that since they didn’t know why she was becoming such a star, anti-heterosexual male sentiment must have been her trade-off. She was derogatively called a “bell hooks baby” by pseudointellectuals seemingly harboring all the classified documents about popular media being an anti-straight male psyop. Somehow, few, if any of them, acknowledged the rise of incel culture, and publicly available stats on gender violence that would justify an openly queer woman being cautious of a straight man. The outrage, insults, and lack of accountability her comments garnered proved her point. Only those blind to the reality of patriarchy as a violent agenda would consider critique and pushback to it as an agenda of its own. \n\n This was just the latest social media firestorm surrounding Doechii, who has faced a new demeaning talking point with every industry accomplishment. She was accused of making “slave and Harriet Tubman music” in a viral X post of her Stephen Colbert performance. Azealia Banks called her an “ugly version” of her. And those who don’t insult her are making their ire for the industry her fault. Major labels’ fixation on virality as the main arbiter of investment has created an environment where we view artists as viral trends instead of human beings. The luster of “Not Like Us” fades when we see Kamala Harris using it at a campaign rally. That’s why the same fans see a surging star trend one too many times and call foul. Save for the circle of old-guard music superstars, the industry relies on a conveyor belt of viral acts who often don’t have the talent for the long haul. When the novelty fades, so does the artist. That’s why we get so unsettled when we see a new artist who doesn’t seem poised for the falloff. \n\n That’s not Doechii’s problem, though. Her 11-year journey is still online to observe on her personal YouTube account, including a chronicling of the moment she was fired from an unsatisfying job and decided to pursue music full time. She told Rolling Stone in 2023 that she got her start putting on all-women rap shows called the Coven Showcase in her native Tampa, Florida. She uploaded Coven Music Session, Vol. 1 in 2019 and Oh the Places You’ll Go in 2020, refining her sound over time. In 2023, she said her next project would be a “conceptual album” that’s ready for the summer; it seems like she went back to the drawing board with Alligator Bites Never Heal. She also sought to better herself as a person, getting sober and reading books like The Artist’s Way. “The only moment that exists is literally right now.… I realized, ‘OK, in this moment, if now is all that exists, do I really want to be scared right now?’ No. Bitch, I want to make a great song, and I want to have fun,“ she said in the 2023 interview. But instead of being inspired that her focus on self-improvement engendered the stardom she sought, her detractors pick for reasons that her success is invalid. Perhaps they should ask themselves if their needless skepticism is a fair reward for overcoming fear.\n\n Doechii’s buzz has made her the belle of Paris Fashion Week, where she made her runway debut for DSquared2 and had several other notable appearances. And seemingly straight off the plane, she recently took the stage with Lauryn Hill at Miami’s Jazz in the Garden festival. Those upset that she’s forging such powerful connections don’t seem to realize that it’s what’s historically happened in the music industry. Labels heavily invest in acts they believe in, and powerful brands partner with them while legendary acts take notice of them. In recent years, we’ve become so used to seeing labels deprioritize marketing that a successful campaign feels like a nefarious agenda instead of successfully performing its job function. It’s fine to be annoyed that the label is trying to make you like something. But marketing isn’t some covert strategy. And it doesn’t feel fair to transfer that annoyance to a talented act. \n\n “Industry plant” is one of those buzzwords that’s never had a universally agreed-upon meaning. It may fit for an artist who popped up out of nowhere while neglecting to mention having a powerful family member in the industry. But it doesn’t fit the profile of Doechii, a 10-year veteran who delivered a polished, adventurous project and paired it with fun music videos and creative direction. She’s a true definition of the “overnight star” being a decade in the making, and she worked hard to warrant the marketing push she’s received. \n\n At the same time that rap fans bemoan the death of rap stardom, there’s dismay that Doechii is becoming a rap star. It’s a befuddling dynamic. Some may legitimately feel like her playful, animated delivery isn’t for them. But the armchair A&Ring has reached a phase of outsmarting itself, where we’re mad at her because her label invested in her — and she met the moment. Most disappointingly though, some of the pushback feels rooted in her being a darkskin, queer Black woman. In this anti-Black country, that’s unfortunately three strikes against an artist.","summary":"The pushback the Grammy-winning rapper has received is largely based on misconceptions, misogyny, and prejudice","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/doechii-online-criticism-controversy-1235293041/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/doechhi-online-discourse-unwarranted.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 19:59:23","author":"Andre Gee,Jon Dolan","authors":["Andre Gee","Jon Dolan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":298762570,"title":"After Dissing Black Americans and Voting for Trump, Latino Voters Want Black Folks to Join Their Fight, But Is it Too Late?","text":"With President Donald Trump enacting mass deportations, attacking birthright citizenship and targeting other civil rights, some Latino Americans are organizing to protest these clear human rights violations. But in their call to action, many are begging the Black community to join their fight, and there’s a couple issues with this.\n\nOn TikTok, Aaron Robles called on Black people to join Latinx efforts. “Do you know what would happen if we had the Black community rocking with us [and] protesting with us?” he asked. Several Latinx organizations, including the Freeze Latino Movement, have called for boycotts against companies supporting Trump’s anti-immigration mandate, according to News 10. \n\nBut they need support from other groups to make a real change, and who better to call than the people who have been fighting oppression in America since the Declaration of Independence? The saying goes, “United we stand, divided we fall,” and although there’s truth in that, what happens when only one of these groups fights the good fight consistently?\n\nTexas Rep. Jasmine Crockett put it clearly. “We need our allies to show us that they’re gonna have our backs going forward before we can say, ‘Oh yeah, we’re jumping in head first,’ ” she told The Root. For her, other minority groups dropped the ball during the 2024 presidential election. More than 50 percent of Latinx people voted for Trump, according to exit polls from NBC News. While over 80 percent of Black folks showed up for then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“What we’re looking for is for them to be willing to talk to those that weren’t on our side,” Crockett continued. “What we need to know is that we’ve got those brown allies that will go out and talk to other brown folks and say, ‘Listen, we have our civil rights because of the Civil Rights Movement that was led by Black folks.’ ”\n\nAs many Latinx people continue to call on Black folks for help, there are others who are urging their own community to get it together. “The Black community doesn’t owe us anything,” Latina TikTok user @cyn_ical.optimist said. “You’re asking where the Black community is when they’re the ones that tried to avoid this,” she continued. “I think it’s time we learned to save ourselves.”\n\nBlack folks have always been champions of civil rights for all, way before Trump took office. And history shows us we haven’t always gotten the credit we deserved for it. And to add even more wood to the fire, the Latinx community has historically battled with prejudice against Black people. A study shared by the National Library of Medicine found 55 percent of US-born Latinos rate Black Americans as lazier than they rate Latinos. \n\nNow, our community is reluctant to help — and for good reason. After Trump’s election, the Black community took a collective step back in hopes that other minority groups would show up to the battlefield just like we have. “We heard him [Trump] say what he was going to do once he got in office. And now he’s doing what he said he’s going to do, and now everybody’s acting confuzzled,” TikTok user @brown.sugar_00 said. \n\nJust because Black folks put their foot down when it comes to joining outside efforts doesn’t mean we’re laying down for the next four years.

But if corporate America chooses to price-gouge the American consumer or attack the American worker because they don't want to pay their fair share, corporate America bears the blame for that decision.\" \n\nFain is one of the only high-profile supporters of Trump's tariffs among automotive leaders. Auto executives as well as trade associations supporting automakers have described the tariffs as adding unnecessary chaos and additional costs to the industry. \n\n\"President Trump has talked a lot about making our U.S. auto industry stronger, bringing more production here, more innovation in the U.S., and if his administration can achieve that, it would be one of … the most signature accomplishments,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley said last month. \"So far what we're seeing is a lot of cost, and a lot of chaos.\" \n\nFain has previously condemned the North American Free Trade Agreement — which has been superseded by Trump's United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA, trade deal since 2020 — saying such trade agreements have caused the country to lose jobs and manufacturing. \n\nFain and Trump have been at odds and publicly trading remarks since the union leader was elected in 2023. Trump called for Fain to be fired during a speech last year at the Republican National Convention. \n\nFain has regularly called Trump a \"scab\" and billionaire who doesn't care about American workers, but his comments Sunday on Trump show his stance may have had softened.\n\n\"The election is over.

That probe resulted in several convictions of union leaders and Fiat Chrysler executives, including two past union presidents. \n\nFederal monitor Neil Barofsky last year disclosed an investigation into Fain as well as other union leaders, accusing them of obstructing an investigation and interfering with access to information. \n\nIn January, the monitor's office said it would provide further updates on its investigative activities in a subsequent report.","summary":"UAW President Shawn Fain showed support for President Donald Trump's tariffs, which include 25% levies on automobiles and supporting parts.","url":"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/10/trump-uaw-auto-union-shawn-fain-tariffs.html","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108022559-1724117740574-gettyimages-2166798094-AFP_36EJ2ZN.jpeg?v=1741635386","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 19:46:18","author":"Michael Wayland","authors":["Michael Wayland"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":298770176,"title":"Nolte: Far-Left NY Times Owes RealClearPolitics Apology After 538 Shutdown","text":"Less than a week before the 2024 presidential election, the far-left New York Times published a vote-suppression piece blistering RealClearPolitics (RCP).\n\n“Why the Right Thinks Trump Is Running Away With the Race,” was the headline.\n\nAs we now know, Trump did run away with the 2024 race. He won the electoral college. He won the popular vote. He swept all seven swing states. He moved vast swaths of the country into the Republican column. His gains with minority voters were nothing short of incredible.\n\nBut less than a week before the election, the Times simply wasn’t ready to face the fact Trump might win reelection and with that reelection repudiate the regime media in a way that would prove they no longer matter.\n\nWhat to do?\n\nWhat to do?\n\nUsing the now-disgraced and shuttered 538 as its unimpeachable source, the Times scoffed at a number of the latest polls that showed Trump leading.\n\nA “torrent of polls began arriving just a few weeks ago, one after the other, most showing a victory for Donald J. Trump,” wrote the Times. These polls “stood out amid the hundreds of others indicating a dead heat in the presidential election.”\n\nAh, but that “torrent of polls,” revealed the Times, were “commissioned by right-leaning groups with a vested interest in promoting Republican strength.”\n\nThen, and without any evidence, the Times accused those pollsters — 37 in all — of being “focused on lifting Republican enthusiasm before the election” and “cementing the idea that the only way Mr. Trump can lose to Vice President Kamala Harris is if the election is rigged.”\n\nGet a load of this beauty…\n\n“That increase comes as the volume of nonpartisan polls — such as those commissioned by major news organizations — have dropped significantly, though they still make up a majority of the polls released.”\n\nSo the Times laughably argued that “polls commissioned by major news organizations” are nonpartisan,” when two decades of evidence proves the exact opposite. The Washington Post, anyone?\n\nThen the Times wrote the following as though it were an absolute fact, just so it could attack RCP…\n\n“Still, the race remains uncommonly close,” wrote the Times, but that “has not stopped these polls from shaping the broader narrative in the race’s final stretch. The averages on the popular aggregation site RealClearPolitics, in particular, are widely cited on social media.”\n\nAnd now we come to RCP’s unpardonable sin…\n\n“Unlike its competitors, RealClearPolitics does not filter out low-quality polls” and also “does not weight its averages.” Which is just another way of saying that, unlike 538 (which got the election wrong and has lost so much money and credibility it just closed in disgrace), RCP does not put its thumb on the scale. It lists the polls and offers the averages, and that’s it.\n\nYou see, to corrupt outlets like the Times, not rigging your numbers is a sin.\n\nIt gets even funnier, especially in hindsight:\n\nThe RCP “no tossups” map “currently shows Mr. Trump winning every swing state,” the Times whines. “Influential accounts have been sharing screenshots of’ the RCP map “paired with images of the Polymarket betting average, which currently shows Mr. Trump with a 65 percent chance of winning.”\n\nOne Democrat strategist told the Times that the goal here was to “shift the polling averages and deflate Democrat enthusiasm.”\n\nAt the time, this article was a joke. Knowing what we know now, it’s a real howler.\n\nRCP got it right in 2024 … or as close to right as anyone could … AGAIN.\n\nI’ve followed RCP for 25 years now for two reasons: 1) They don’t mess with the numbers, and 2) they don’t mess with the numbers.\n\nBut here we are, four months after this New York Times hit piece ran, and the truth will out. All those “right-leaning polls” were correct. And because they don’t arrogantly tweak the numbers, RCP was correct. But all those nonpartisan “polls commissioned by major news organizations” were dead wrong. And because they did arrogantly fudge with the numbers, 538 has been shuttered in disgrace.\n\nWe also know that every premise that hit piece was based on was a total lie.\n\nThe New York Times has some awfully stupid readers if they put up with being deceived like this.\n\nMeanwhile, RCP readers are more than satisfied. \n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

Don's hunting buddy, the Lebanese dealmaker and a secret sister","text":"President Donald Trump has never been overly concerned with convention.\n\nAnd, with DOGE mastermind Elon Musk at his side, his ambitions to reshape American politics and tear up the traditional playbook are clear.\n\nSo perhaps it is no surprise that, when it comes to selecting an inner circle of trusted advisors for his second administration, Trump is eschewing career politicians and the usual DC types for a rather more eclectic crowd.\n\nHis eldest son, Don Jr, 47 - who has no formal experience in politics - is reportedly the president's 'conduit, whisperer and translator', and the person Trump turns to before even his Vice President JD Vance, or his formidable Chief of Staff Susie Wiles.\n\nAnd then there's the former reality TV star, the super-model, and the mom-fluencer - to name just a few of those who have been allowed into the Trump inner sanctum.\n\nHere, the Daily Mail details the key players who have the ear of the president and his closest family...\n\nMideast 'Dealmaker'\n\nTrump's youngest daughter Tiffany, 31, and Michael Boulos, 27, met at a Mykonos beach club in 2018 and married in a spectacular Mar-a-Lago ceremony in 2022.\n\nTrump has since formed a close relationship with Michael's father, Lebanese-born businessman Massad Boulos, 54.\n\nDuring Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, Boulos rallied support for Trump among Arab Americans, campaigning in key communities in the swing-state of Michigan and elsewhere. Boulos may also have served as a go-between for Trump and Palestinian Authority leader Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nAfter the attempted assassination of Trump in July, Boulos reportedly handed Trump a letter from Abbas expressing his well-wishes. In December 2024, Trump tapped Boulos to be an adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs - and has touted Trump's Gaza reconstruction plan.\n\nTrump has praised Boulos as a 'highly respected leader in the business world, with extensive experience on the international scene' and a 'dealmaker.' A New York Times investigation showed that Boulos works for his father-in-law's selling trucks and heavy machinery for a Nigeria-based company that earned a profit of less than $66,000 in 2023.\n\nThe Reality Star\n\nSigalit 'Siggy' Flicker, 57, a former Real Housewives of New Jersey star is now a fixture at Trump's Mar-A-Lago club.\n\nThe Israeli-born professional matchmaker made her debut to American audiences in the VH1 reality-television series Why Am I Still Single?!, before appearing on the 2016 and 2017 seasons of Real Housewives.\n\nFlicker grew close to Trump through mutual friend and lawyer Alina Habba, who now serves as counsellor to the president.\n\n'We've had dinners with him. I've flown on his airplane to rallies with him and when we went to South Carolina, we drove for 30 minutes in the car,' Flicker said in 2023, adding 'he is the most popular president whether you like him or not.'\n\nThe feeling is apparently mutual. Trump said Flicker is 'one of the greatest people in the world' during a campaign speech in August 2024.\n\nFlicker is now a spokesperson for #Jexit – a movement of mostly Jewish individuals who say they've been driven out of the Democratic Party by progressive ideology.\n\nMom-fluencer\n\nDr Gina Loudon, 57, may be best known in MAGA world as the mother of Bo Loudon, 18, close friend of First Son Barron.\n\nBo burst onto the political scene in the 2024 presidential campaign when played a key role rallying Gen-Z voters to the Republican cause. But mom Gina has been in Trump's political circle for far longer.\n\nGina worked as a surrogate on Trump 2016 presidential campaign and in 2020 co-chaired the Women for Trump organization and then served on the campaign's media advisory board.\n\nNow, the mother of five (including one adopted child with Down Syndrome), currently co-hosts the morning show American Sunrise on the cable network Real America's Voice.\n\nThe Hunting Buddy\n\nKyle Diamantas, 37, is comrade-in-arms with Don Jr, who is an avid outdoorsman. The president's eldest son has even dared animal rights 'crazies' to stop him from posting his wildlife trophies from hunts ranging from Zimbabwe to Texas.\n\nIn March 2021, Diamantas and Don Jr were pictured in full camouflage while on a turkey hunt in Osceola country, Florida. Each proudly held aloft the wild birds that they stalked and killed.\n\nUntil recently, Diamantas was a partner in the Miami office of the multinational law firm Jones Day based in Washington, DC. But in February, President Trump put Diamantas in charge of overseeing America's food safety, naming him acting deputy commissioner for human foods at the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAs an attorney, Diamantas was involved in a wide range of regulatory, compliance, and enforcement matters involving consumer goods clients. But critics have questioned his credentials to take on such a critical role.\n\nDon's Adoring Ex\n\nDon Jr's ex-wife Vanessa filed for divorce in 2018, however, the pair has stayed close.\n\nVanessa was even seen warmly socializing with Don Jr's new girlfriend Bettina Anderson in September 2024. The two ladies were pictured sharing a chair at a family gathering in Jupiter, Florida.\n\nDon Jr met Vanessa Haydon at a New York City fashion show in 2003. They were engaged in November 2004 and married at Mar-a-Lago a year later. The pair have five kids: Kai, 17, Donald Jr III, 15, Tristan, 13, Spencer, 12, and Chloe, 10.\n\nVanessa's greatest influence on Trump is likely through her children. That became clear at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Daughter Kai, a standout golfer, is very close to the president – and quite the political asset as well.\n\nHer heartfelt RNC speech about her grandfather made her the star of the show – and since that night she has gained over 1 million followers on Instagram.\n\nRight-wing Wingman\n\nIn January, Don Jr travelled to Nuuk, Greenland with Charlie Kirk, 31, co-founder of the conservative advocacy group Turning Point USA. Only days earlier, President Trump expressed his interest in exerting greater US control over the territory.\n\nCharlie shared details of their travels on his podcast, The Charlie Kirk Show, revealing that he flew on the family's private jet. And, indeed, the Kirk's involvement with the Trump clan goes back nearly a decade.\n\nIn 2016, Turning Point, which Kirk founded when he was just 18, backed Donald Trump for president and Kirk served as a personal aide to Don Jr during the general election campaign.\n\nReturning the favor, Don Jr and then-fiancé Kimberly Guilfoyle, were Charlie's first guests when his podcast launched in 2019.\n\nMulti-millionaire gal pal\n\nWendi Deng, third wife of media mogul Rupert Murdoch (they divorced in 2013), has been close friends with Ivanka Trump, 43, since 2005, when they were neighbors in New York City.\n\nWendi, 56, once said they bonded over their working-mom lifestyles. 'As modern working moms, we have faced many of the same challenges and joys,' Wendi wrote in a profile about Ivanka for Time Magazine's 2017 list of the 100 most influential people.\n\nIvanka has gushed about Wendi in return, telling Vogue, 'I can't recall the last time I had a conversation with her that didn't conclude with her connecting me to four people who might become great friends or great business opportunities.'\n\nThe First Daughter also has Wendi to thank for her marriage to Jared Kushner.\n\nIvanka and Kushner briefly broke up in 2008 because Kushner, who was raised in a modern Orthodox Jewish family, said he wanted him to marry a Jewish woman.\n\nWendi brought the him and Ivanka back together by inviting them on a yacht trip during which they rekindled their romance. Ivanka converted to Judaism in 2009.\n\nThe Supermodel\n\nVictoria's Secret Angel Karlie Kloss, 32, is not secretive about her political views, having shared social media posts voicing her support for Joe Biden in 2020 and Kamala Harris in 2024. However, her marriage to Joshua Kushner - Ivanka's brother-in-law - has kept her firmly within the First Daughter's inner circle.\n\nKarlie admitted that she had tried to challenge Ivanka and Jared's politics when she tweeted about the January 6 riots in 2020: 'Accepting the results of a legitimate democratic election is patriotic. Refusing to do so and inciting violence is anti-American.'\n\nA user then urged Karlie to 'tell your sister-in-law and brother-in-law,' to which the supermodel responded, 'I've tried.'\n\nThe Ivanka and Karlie were last pictured together almost 10 years ago at the US Open in 2016. There was speculation in July 2024 that they'd had a falling out after they both attended the lavish wedding of mutual friend and Indian billionaire Anant Ambani without being snapped together at the celebration.\n\nBut a source insisted there is no bad blood and that the two women share a 'good relationship' despite their political differences. The source said they are not 'best friends,' but they do 'get along.'\n\nThe Kardashian \n\nIvanka met Kim Kardashian at the 2014 Met Gala, and their friendship rekindled in 2018, when the reality star asked the First Daughter to facilitate a meeting at the White House to discuss criminal justice reform with President Trump.\n\nKim announced her decision to pursue a law degree earlier that year in order to help wrongfully convicted inmates or those with unfair sentences.\n\nBy the time of Kim's 43rd birthday bash in 2023, the two were firm friends, with Ivanka scoring the seat of honor - right next to Kim - at her celebratory dinner.\n\nA source told Us Weekly: 'Kim and Ivanka have been friends… They initially bonded nearly a decade ago at the Met Gala over motherhood and being new moms. But they continued to connect numerous times over the years.'\n\nLast month, sources told In Touch that a now-single Kim is relying on her bestie Ivanka to set her up with one of Washington DC's most eligible bachelors: 'She'd love to date a power player on Capitol Hill, and no doubt there are plenty of guys out that way who'd leap at the chance to hook up with Kim, too. She's counting on Ivanka to make it happen.'\n\nSecret Sister\n\nSurprisingly little is known about the woman that Melania Trump has credited as being her 'guiding light and inspiration'. \n\nBut sources told the Daily Mail that Melania's older sister, Ines Knauss, 57, is an ever-present source of comfort and advice to the First Lady.\n\nKnauss hasn't been pictured with the First Family for two decades. She was not at Trump's inauguration, and nor was she seen at her mother Amalija's funeral in January last year.\n\nRegardless, an insider familiar with the First Lady's thinking told the Mail that 'Melania and Ines are very close and since Melania's mother died, Ines and their father are probably the two people Melania trusts the most.'\n\nEx-CIA asset\n\nHayley Harrison, 33, was named Chief of Staff to the First Lady in November 2024, a position which puts her in charge of operations in Melania's East Wing offices.\n\nHarrison has been working with Melania since March 2017, when she left her role as an office manager for then-US representative John Ratcliffe, now Director of the CIA. Ratcliffe reportedly recommended Harrison to the First Lady.\n\nShe became so trusted by Melania that she continued to work for her at Mar-a-Lago after the Trumps left the White House in 2020 – and she was caught up in Trump's post-presidency prosecutions.\n\nShe was identified as 'Trump Employee 1' in the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, which saw Trump indicted in June 2022 but the case was ultimately dismissed in 2024.\n\nThe indictment contains text messages between Harris and another aide, as they discussed moving Trump's boxes out of documents to create room for staff to work.\n\n'There is still a little room in the shower where his other stuff is. Is it only his papers he cares about?' Harrison wrote, according to the indictment. Harrison was never charged with a crime.","summary":"When it comes to selecting an inner circle of trusted advisors for his second administration, Trump is eschewing career politicians and the usual DC types for a rather more eclectic crowd.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14474745/donald-trump-whisperers-never-heard-of.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/10/18/95966391-0-image-m-70_1741629871563.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 19:35:11","author":"Editor,Martha Williams","authors":["Editor","Martha Williams"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.322},{"id":298763760,"title":"The Washington Post is reinventing its newsroom as it struggles to retain subscribers","text":"(CNN) — The Washington Post announced a major “reinvention” of its newsroom Monday, as the ailing Jeff Bezos-owned publication looks to grow its dwindling subscription numbers.\n\nLess than one week after its billionaire owner introduced a “significant shift” to the paper’s opinion section, Matt Murray, the Post’s executive editor, announced a flurry of changes. In an email obtained by CNN, he said the newsroom will reorganize and reallocate resources to “evolve with reader habits.”\n\nAccording to Murray’s email, the changes include separating its digital and print workflows while building out its central news hub, reorganizing several news departments, and beefing up WP Ventures, previously referred to as “the third newsroom,” a budding project that will see the Post expand its social media presence and create new commercial opportunities.\n\nThe email said the paper must become “obsessed with engagement” and become “a reader’s news organization,” not a “writer’s paper.” To meet “all audiences where they are,” Murray wrote that the Post will produce less commodity news, instead offering a “greater variety of story formats and a sharper focus.”\n\nMurray’s mandate will see the Post become a digital-first news organization. While the publisher’s newspaper will remain, the paper will refocus its central news desk on its digital products. This includes adding a head of print to silo print production from the rest of the newsroom — though Murray noted the new role will ensure a “lively, robust, visually strong and engaging” print edition.\n\nMeanwhile, the National section will be split, with one section focused on Politics and Government and another on National reporting. Most reporters currently covering politics will shift to the former section, which will include reporters from the Economics and Economic Policy team, while the new National team will cover notable issues and figures outside of the capital.\n\nOther beats are similarly being folded into a larger section: Business, Technology, Health & Science, and Climate are all being combined into a new department focused on “the frontiers of the 21st century,” Murray said in the email.\n\nIn addition to these changes, Murray said the Post is finally looking to add personnel to WP Ventures, a project created by Will Lewis, the Post’s chief executive and publisher. Lewis has hailed WP Ventures, which he first announced in June, as a “definitive step away from the ‘one size fits all’ approach and moving towards meeting our audiences where they are.”\n\nStaunching their losses\n\nAlthough the Post has largely remained tight-lipped on the initiative, it has previously said WP Ventures’ aim is to “strengthen our business by increasing the profitability of our new products and experiences that drive habit and are worth paying for,” making the project’s mandate clear: to win back readers.\n\nLast month, Bezos overhauled the paper’s Opinion section, leading to at least 75,000 readers ending their subscriptions and the resignation of Opinions editor David Shipley, NPR reported. This followed a reported loss of 250,000 subscribers — and the resignation of three editorial board members — after Bezos blocked an op-ed that endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris for president in October.\n\nAs the second newsroom, the Opinion section is a much smaller, less costly operation than the newsroom and WP Ventures. Yet the section will now publish fewer pieces with a much slimmer editorial margin.\n\nTo make matters worse, the New York Times on Monday reported that Ruth Marcus, an associate editor and columnist for the Post, became the latest staffer to resign after Lewis rejected a column on Bezos’ changes.\n\n“Will’s decision to not (…) run the column that I wrote respectfully dissenting from Jeff’s edict — something that I have not experienced in almost two decades of column-writing — underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,” Marcus wrote in an email to Bezos and Lewis obtained by the Times.\n\nAs Murray recently reminded staff, editorial sections are “traditionally the provenance of the owner at news organizations.”\n\nStill, it’s highly unusual for a publication’s owner to dictate its op-ed section. While both Opinion and op-ed are separate from the Post’s newsroom, Marcus’ resignation highlights the ironic contrast between the newsroom — which is placing an onus on meeting its progressive audiences where they are — and the paper’s owner — whose changes are already muzzling the very writers Post readers go to the paper for.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Ann Selzer that showed Harris carrying the state by three points. Donald Trump immediately pounced, calling the poll “fake.” A politician criticizing a poll he doesn’t like is nothing new, but Trump elevated his pique to a lawsuit filed against Selzer and the poll’s sponsor, the Des Moines Register and its parent company. In an amended brief, he was joined by two other Iowans, Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and former state senator Bradley Zaun, who both believe the poll harmed them as well. On February 21, Selzer and her attorneys responded asking that the case be dismissed.\n\nThe late October Iowa Poll received outsized attention for several reasons. The country was in the final days of a hard fought presidential campaign where the candidates had been neck and neck in national polls for weeks. The poll dropped at a particularly critical time, 6 p.m. on November 2, just three days before the election. The striking new finding seemed to suggest significant momentum for Kamala Harris. In Trump’s petition’s words, the poll’s finding created “a false narrative of inevitability.”\n\nThe reputation of the Register’s Iowa Polls in recent presidential contests were a second factor. Trump won solid victories in the state in 2016 (9.5 points) and 2020 (8.2 points). Both margins were in line with the Des Moines Register polls’ results. Trump won the state by 13.2 points in 2024, yet Selzer’s final poll had Harris leading. The result was especially surprising because her September poll had shown Trump in the lead. Outliers happen.\n\nA third factor was the pollster herself. Ann Selzer was one of the industry’s most respected pollsters and that gave her poll instant credibility with many. She had overseen the Des Moines Register polls for more than three decades and had a solid track record covering not only presidential contests, but many Senate and gubernatorial contests as well. As happens to any pollster who has been in the business a long time, there were some prominent contests where her results didn’t match election tallies. .\n\nSparring with the media and holding grudges are features of Donald Trump’s combative personality. Like some other politicians, he is no fan of the polls except for those showing him doing well. Perhaps that is why he brought a lawsuit that appears, at least to this non-lawyer, unlikely to succeed. Trump filed the suit with his two coplaintiffs, using a consumer fraud statute to argue that the “fake” poll “deceived millions of Americans” and caused the plaintiffs harm by forcing them to divert resources to address it.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\n‘Panic-Selling’ Could Be About To Crash The Bitcoin Price\n\nFBI Warning—Delete These Texts On Your iPhone, Android Phone\n\nPayPal Scam Warning—Dangerous Invoice Bypasses Email Security\n\nThe highly respected nonpartisan organization the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) is representing Selzer and the Des Moines Register. In their brief, FIRE attorneys argued that the lawsuit fits “the very definition of a ‘SLAPP’ suit” — a Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation meant to punish defendants through time and costs of litigation. FIRE argues that the First Amendment “bars the action.”\n\nThe Selzer legal team notes that the Supreme Court has said that simply labeling an action as fraudulent “is not sufficient for it to be fraudulent.” They charge that the suit is using claims of fraud to evade First Amendment protections. Trump claims that false news lies outside the First Amendment’s protection, but Selzer’s lawyers claim that “over 200 years of American free speech law and practice prove otherwise.”\n\nThe Selzer brief makes the obvious claim that “pollsters are not seers” and that results don’t always conform to final results. The lawyers note that every election has outlier polls. At the time Selzer released her poll, several poll watchers and their news organizations suggested hers could be one. An Emerson College poll taken around the same time had Trump comfortably ahead in Iowa.\n\nI am a critic of the wall-to-wall coverage the media gives horserace polls during elections and then in presidential administrations. We are barely a month into the Trump presidency, and the pollsters and their media partners are still in campaign mode, having a field day charting whether Trump is winning or losing with the public. I don’t object to the polls themselves but the media’s insatiable consumption of transitory snapshots seems to me to be crowding out polls that could tell us a lot more about what makes our society tick.\n\nIt seems unlikely that Donald Trump will win this case. Selzer has retired as the paper’s pollster. Whatever the outcome, lawsuits like this one can tarnish the value that polling can provide.\n\n Check out my website.\nEditorial StandardsForbes Accolades","summary":"It seems unlikely that Donald Trump will win his lawsuit against pollster Ann Selzer.

As President Trump imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico, our president made clear that \"if companies move to the United States, there are no tariffs!!!\" In recent days, President Trump declared in his joint address to Congress that \"tariffs are about making America rich again.\"Having travelled our nation with President Trump as his chief of staff, let me tell you that he will never stop fighting for American manufacturing workers. As the Trump administration works to stop the flood of fentanyl and illegal immigration from Canada and Mexico, President Trump also recognizes that there is a flood of foreign aluminum and steel surging into our country.In 2018, President Trump imposed the Section 232 aluminum and steel tariffs under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. In February 2025, President Trump signed into law two new proclamations to strengthen the Section 232 tariffs that were introduced during his historic first term. With a 25 percent elevated tariff on aluminum and a true 25percent tariff on steel, the days of the Biden administration giving country exemptions and exceptions is over.The fearmongering from the fake news media and globalist zealots who espouse free markets but have seldom experienced one miss the mark on why President Trump is fighting for American manufacturing workers. The claims of massive job loss and economic hardship from the Section 232 aluminum and steel tariffs were proven to be false. We have seen this story before.The first term tariffs so reviled by globalists sparked a tremendous period of investment and jobs creation by American aluminum manufacturers. All across America's heartland, U.S. producers such as Magnitude 7 Metals, Century Aluminum, and Alcoa restarted idled capacity. Then Joe Biden got elected and the globalist elites took over.Rather than enforce the Section 232 program, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris gave exemptions to allies and enemies alike, undoing the progress of the first Trump term and putting Americans out of work. The People's Republic of China and Russia exploited loopholes by moving aluminum through Mexico and Canada, which killed American aluminum jobs. The damage can be measured in idled smelters and lost aluminum and steel jobs alongside shattered dreams for American workers.By raising the aluminum tariff to 25 percent and eliminating the Biden exemptions, President Trump is delivering on his pledge to put American workers first and inaugurate a new golden age.Our adversaries have taken advantage of the weakness of Biden and Harris to not only dump aluminum and steel into our market but also by funneling supplies into border countries such as Canada and Mexico. Just as illegal migrants were flooding across our southern border bringing drugs and crime until President Trump took office, Canada and Mexico are allowing foreign aluminum producers to circumvent trade restrictions and flood the U.S. market. Ultimately American aluminum workers and their families feel the pain when Canada, Mexico, and other countries don't play by the rules. President Trump is done subsidizing Canada. That is why the president is imposing a 25 percent tariff on all foreign aluminum imports with no exemptions and no exceptions.President Trump's visionary leadership has changed the way Washington deals with our allies and adversaries on trade. The beneficiaries of that America First trade policy are the hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers whose jobs have been saved. As President Trump said in his address before the joint session of Congress \"tariffs are not just about protecting American jobs, they're about protecting the soul of our country.\"America is stronger when its aluminum industry is strong. America is stronger when its steel industry is strong. And thanks to President Trump, 25 percent tariffs on aluminum and steel imports with no exceptions will make America strong again.Mark Meadows served as the 29th White House chief of staff and as member of the U.S. representative for North Carolina's 11th Congressional District from 2013–2020.

Tim Walz on Saturday at SXSW in Austin, Texas. Remember Tim Walz? His running mate, former Vice President Kamala Harris, has been keeping a relatively low profile since leaving elected office earlier this year, but Walz is still out there talking — to Rachel Maddow, to Molly Jong-Fast, to David Remnick, and now to me — about what the Democrats could, should, and need to do to oppose Donald Trump and MAGA. I asked him what he’s running from — and if there’s anything he’s running for. \nBelow you’ll find an excerpt of our conversation for Today, Explained that’s been edited for clarity. You can also listen to the interview below or wherever you listen to podcasts.\n[Media: https://megaphone.link/VMP7419009932]\nDo you think these guys are still weird?\nOh, hell yes. Look, obsessing with choices people are making about their own lives that has absolutely zero to do with you. That is weird. That might be too soft. That is really unnecessary.\nDid you watch the joint session this week?\nYeah, parts of it. I did.\nI felt like the messaging from the Democrats was muddled at that joint session. Some didn’t show up at all. Some left early, some wore pink and held up these feeble signs that said, “False!” or “This is not normal.” We all saw Representative Al Green protest. But there wasn’t a unified message. Did you want to see something more unified from your party?\nYes. Other than bidding on an antique tea set or whatever was happening? Yes, I wanted something more than that. I’m hearing it from my constituents in Minnesota, and I’m hearing it across the country. There’s a primal scream of “Do something! Do something!” \nNow I have the advantage — as a governor, I can do something. We can put up firewalls against them. You’re not going to demonize our people. We’re going to continue to make sure our children are fed. I called the premiers of Ontario and Manitoba and said, “Look, the official policy is theirs. But we like you. We like Canadians. We like what we trade together.”\nWhen I get asked, “What should we be doing?” I’m probably the last guy. I didn’t get it done. And we needed to win. And that’s where we’re in this pickle because we didn’t win. But I’m being reflective of what I could have done better, what I should have done better. \nI don’t have a big solution. But what I think for all of us, which is encouraging to me, these town halls — the kind of organic folks bringing up — there’s not going to be a charismatic leader right in and come up with this just perfectly delivered message. It’s going to get us out of this. It’s going to be a whole bunch of people who don’t want to see kids go hungry, who don’t want to see health care ripped apart, who don’t want to throw Ukraine under the bus on the side of Russia. Those folks are going to stand up and make a difference.\nSo yes, in answer to your question [on Democrats’ response to Trump’s speech]: Yes, it’s frustrating, but it’s hard. I served for 12 years in Congress and someone said, “Would you like to go back?” I said, “I would rather eat glass than go back to Congress.”\nJames Carville said in a New York Times op-ed that the Democrats [should] sort of roll over and play dead, let the Republicans have their way with the government, anger voters to the point that they’re repulsed by their policies, and then go for a shot in the jugular. What do you think of that strategy?\nWell, I don’t agree with it, and I don’t agree with this idea that people need to feel the pain. I’m going to do all that I can as governor. I said to my team that we protect the most vulnerable. We protect our gains. That’s what we’re going to do.\nThis isn’t simple disagreement on tax rates, simple disagreement on how much we should do on defense spending versus domestic or whatever. This is an all-out assault around Article I of the Constitution.\nAgain, I don’t want to overreact, but I said this last week and I stand by this: The road to authoritarianism is littered with people saying, “You’re overreacting.” And I think that piece of it, of speaking out, matters. \nHave [Trump’s team] done anything you liked? They’ve done a lot.\nTwo things. I’ll mention this especially today, tonight. I think I come down on Trump’s side on Daylight Savings Time. So we started talking about that. I’ll give you that, I’ll give you that one. And believe it or not, this is bizarre, I heard Donald Trump talk about this and I’m with him: I think we should get rid of the penny. I think it’s outlived its thing. So yeah, the world’s melting down around us. But Donald and I are solving the penny crisis.\nSo let’s talk about 2024 for a minute here. Not because I want to dwell on the past, but you brought it up that you guys didn’t win. I want to better understand why not. You guys didn’t swing a single swing state in your direction. A lot of people were stunned by that. Were you stunned?\nYeah. In this business, you’ve got to be steely eyed and coldhearted about where things are at. I spent my time in about seven swing states, and felt like I was getting down to where folks were at. Obviously not. And I think the soul searching that comes with that is: Why did our message about focusing on the middle class, expanded health care, Medicare, help for home health care work, environmental issues — why did that not work? Because it felt like to me that it was resonating and it did not.\nAnd I think the team around me said this: We’ll either win all seven or we’ll lose all seven on this. I think that they thought because — these things are so nationalized now that it didn’t matter that I’m in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, talking to folks or up in Erie. Or you’re in Waukesha in Wisconsin. The national narrative over the top of that was going to drive it, and it felt like we were there. And I [was], you know, drinking my own Kool-Aid or whatever. And that’s on me. I said I own that.\nYou’ve been doing soul searching. If there’s one thing you can take back or do over, what do you think it would be?\nYeah, I think I would have taken back getting myself sucked into the conversation around what was happening in Springfield, Ohio. It so struck me, like, reprehensible that they were saying this about people that I was in like a three- or four-day debate, making my case that this is not happening in Springfield, Ohio. And every time I was saying that we were talking about Springfield, Ohio, and immigration — we weren’t talking about other things that mattered to people. And I went down that line trying to do, I think morally the right thing.\nIt turns out, how much have you heard about Springfield, Ohio, by the way, since that election? What Donald Trump has mastered is he floods the zone to the point where you don’t get to make your point. And it doesn’t matter if it was eating dogs and cats, because it was immigration and people were uncomfortable with immigration. And so I would, I would do that differently.\nI don’t think Vice President Harris has been asked this, but I bet one thing she wished she could take back was that moment in that interview with The View, where she said she wouldn’t change a single thing the Biden administration was doing. I’m sure the right loved that, and I think a lot of people on the left were stunned by that. Had that question been posed to you, what were the things that the Biden administration could have been doing better for the American people?\nYeah, he should have been out there telling us that inflation was real. And this hurt. In retrospect, I think there should have been talk about sending, especially in the summer of ’23, potentially sending stimulus checks to folks to try and counter some of that and making it clear that we were fighting for them. Look, I think you were always going against this idea of change. It was a change election. It’s happened globally. We needed to be the change. And what that statement, more than anything, was — a lot of great work was done by the administration. We do have the best economy, but that doesn’t matter on a micro scale to someone if they can’t afford the rent payment.\nBut in fairness to the vice president, had it been me in that moment, I might have [said] that same thing. And I think that we as Democrats better do some soul searching about that. Why would we do that? It’s not like we’re blindly loyal, like, you know, the Trump folks are. But it’s okay to criticize people you like. In fact, that’s what you need.\nYou watch the RNC, you don’t see the Bushes on stage. You certainly don’t see the Chaneys, but you watch the DNC and you still see the Obamas and the Clintons. Do you think it’s time the Democratic Party refresh a little bit, put some fresh faces on there? Because here we are, and there’s still — no one has any idea who’s coming next.\nWell, I will say this: The DNC was a good party. I thought it would do something better than them. But yes, let’s have our 2028 candidate have hair.\nSo the Trump campaign seems to mostly run on the economy, immigration, but they get to office and it feels like they’re mostly focused on draining the so-called swamp and, and “wokeness.” Now the wokeness they seem to be campaigning against, some of it started in your state with the murder of George Floyd. And it seems like they are betting that the majority of the American people, or at least their base, thinks that there was an overcorrection after the death of George Floyd — whatever happened with BLM and DEI. What do you think about that? \nI think we have not done a good job of explaining it. I think we need to name [racism] when it happens. But we also need to tell the average person — who I do not believe is racist, but [who] doesn’t understand what we’re saying. And they have been conditioned by the other side that we are somehow passing over well-qualified white males to put these people in there. I think we as Democrats have a great example to rebut that: Just look at this current cabinet. If that’s the best and brightest coming from the other side, we should make that case about accountability.\nThere’s some cognitive dissonance in this country right now, because some people can’t believe that we’re canceling aid to African children, that we’re deporting migrants the way we’re doing it, that we’re treating trans people the way we’re treating them. And then it seems like half the country’s pleased as punch about it all, which is confusing. It feels like we’re losing a sense of ourselves.\nBut you just spent months crisscrossing the country, shaking every hand in sight, and you seem like a glass-half-full kind of guy. What would you say to people who are losing faith in their American identity right now? Because it feels like you’ve still got faith. \nIt’s tough. I don’t want to whistle past the graveyard, but it’s not a cliche: Every generation has to renew the democracy. And again, I will admit it. I would like to live in precedented times. I’m sick of living in unprecedented time. I want normalcy, I don’t want to see these people. But there’s also an opportunity and a privilege for us to, to reimagine.\nI think we’re still exorcizing ghosts that haven’t been exorcised since the beginning of this country. I think they’re just coming back out. I think they’re raising their head up again, and we’re going to have to deal with them. So I think it’s our responsibility, I think the privilege of being in that battle.\nI got asked the other day, “Who’s the leader of the Democratic Party?” I’m like, “Hell if I know. I think it’s the people who are out there. I think it’s the working class.” Because we are not cultish.\nIt’s pretty clear if you ask a Republican who’s the leader of the Republican Party? Because they can’t say it fast enough, put on their red hat and dance to the tune. We’re not going to dance to that tune. But we have a set of shared values. And so I am optimistic. I do believe that arc in the moral universe bends, but I don’t think it bends by itself. I think you got to reach up and pull it some to get there. \nYou’re talking to us right now at SXSW. I saw you on Maddow. I saw you talking to Molly Jong-Fast, David Remnick. Are you running for somethin’ right now?\nI am not. I have the potential, if I would be given the privilege, to run for a third term of governor of Minnesota. We just need to make sure that we have a winning candidate for ’28 — not because they’re [a Democrat], but because they care about people and they adhere to our values.","summary":"I sat down with Minnesota Gov.

The streaming platform plans to add seven seasons of The Apprentice by April 27. Each week, another season of the show will be made available. \n\nThe reality series boosted Trump’s public profile - and gave him a catchphrase of “You’re Fired!” - when it first aired in the early 2000s and became a career-defining part of Trump’s image before he became president in 2016. \n\n“I look forward to watching this show myself—such great memories, and so much fun, but most importantly, it was a learning experience for all of us!” Trump said in a statement attached to the announcement.\n\nIt is the latest move for a company associated with Bezos to affiliate itself closer with the president. \n\nThough Bezos and Trump did not get along during the president’s first term in office, the two became allies while Trump was in the throws of his third presidential campaign. Bezos directed the newspaper he owns, The Washington Post, to spike its endorsement of former vice president Kamala Harris during the presidential election. After Trump was elected, Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund. \n\nAmazon is also reportedly paying $40 million to license a documentary about Melania Trump.\n\nBezos was present at Trump’s inauguration with other tech CEOs such as Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. \n\nNow, Prime Video users can stream the show that launched Trump’s famous catchphrase into the mainstream spotlight.

(AP) — Bernie Sanders is standing alone on the back of a pickup truck shouting into a bullhorn.\n\nHe’s facing several hundred ecstatic voters huddled outside a suburban Detroit high school — the group that did not fit inside the high school’s gym or two overflow rooms. The crowd screams in delight when he tells them that a combined total of 9,000 people had shown up for the rally.\n\n“What all of this tells me, is not just in Michigan or in Vermont, the people of this country will not allow us to move toward oligarchy. They will not allow Trump to take us into authoritarianism,” Sanders yelled. “We’re prepared to fight. And we’re going to win.”\n\nAt 83 years old, Sanders is not running for president again. But the stooped and silver-haired democratic socialist has emerged as a leader of the resistance to Donald Trump’s second presidency. In tearing into Trump’s seizure of power and warning about the consequences of firing tens of thousands of government workers, Sanders is bucking the wishes of those who want Democrats to focus on the price of eggs or “roll over and play dead.”\n\nFor now, at least, Sanders stands alone as the only elected progressive willing to mount a national campaign to harness the fear and anger of the sprawling anti-Trump movement.\n\nHe drew a crowd of 4,000 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday night. He faced another 2,600 or so the next morning a few hours away in Altoona, Wisconsin, a town of less than 10,000 residents. And his crowd of 9,000 in suburban Detroit exceeded his own team’s expectations. By design, each stop was in a swing U.S. House district represented by a Republican.\n\nSanders, who was just elected to his fourth Senate term from Vermont, conceded that this is not the role he expected to play at this stage of his career.\n\nIn fact, his team intentionally waited in the early weeks of the Trump presidency to launch what they are now calling his “stop oligarchy tour” to see if a high-profile Democrat would fill the leadership void. Instead, Sanders — who is not a Democrat himself despite allying with Senate Democrats and running twice for the party’s presidential nomination — has people wondering if he’s considering another White House bid.\n\n“This is like presidential campaign rallies, isn’t it? But I’m not running for president, and this is not a campaign,” Sanders told The Associated Press. “You gotta do what you gotta do. The country’s in trouble and I want to play my role.”\n\nThe divided Democratic resistance\n\nSince losing the White House, Democrats across Washington have struggled to coalesce behind a consistent message or messenger to stop Trump’s aggressive moves to slash the government workforce, weaken federal oversight and empower tech titan Elon Musk to execute his vision.\n\nThere has been no centralized movement to organize the anti-Trump resistance.\n\n“You look around — who else is doing it? No one,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said of Sanders’ efforts. “My hope is that the dam will break in terms of Democrats going on the offense … We need to take the argument directly to the people.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a longtime Sanders ally, said she would join him on the road in the coming weeks. She’s also planning solo appearances in Republican-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York — and perhaps others in places where Republicans have declined to hold in-person town halls where they might face protests.\n\n“It’s not about whether Bernie should or shouldn’t be doing this. It’s about that we all should,” she said. “But he is unique in this country, and so long as we are blessed to have that capacity on our side, I think we should be thankful for it.”\n\nBeyond Sanders’ tour, angry voters have so far relied on grassroots groups like Indivisible to organize a series of local protests. They have been effective in pressuring Trump’s allies in some cases. A number of House Republicans facing angry questions have criticized Musk or questioned the cuts being carried out at his allies’ behest.\n\nIndivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who has been critical of many Democratic leaders, praised Sanders for stepping up.\n\n“I wish more Democrats were traveling the country, including to red states, to rally the the majority against Musk and Project 2025,” Levin said. “Sure as hell beats (House Democratic leader Hakeem) Jeffries traveling the country for his children’s book tour during a constitutional crisis.”\n\nDuring last month’s congressional recess, Jeffries made two appearances to promote a children’s book about democracy. He has also traveled to support House Democrats. This past weekend, he was in Selma, Alabama, to mark the 60th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n\nThe truth is that few, if any, Democratic leaders have the capacity to draw such crowds on short notice or organize the related logistics on a national scale. The party’s nascent class of 2028 presidential prospects, a group that includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, have limited national profiles and they have been reluctant to step too far into the national spotlight so far.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, among the more outspoken Trump critics in Congress, said that Democrats must be better organized.\n\n“People are desperate to be plugged into action right now. People see the threat. They are anxious and angry and motivated and they want to be sent in a direction to help,” he said.\n\nMurphy acknowledged that Sanders still has plenty of detractors within the Democratic Party who view him and his progressive policy ideas — replacing private and job-based health insurance with a government-funded “Medicare for All” plan, free public college, and the “Green New Deal” on climate policy — as too radical.\n\nIndeed, it was just five years ago when Democrats coalesced around Joe Biden to effectively block Sanders from winning the party’s 2020 presidential nomination.\n\n“There still are a lot of folks who view Bernie as a danger to the party,” Murphy said, “whereas I see his message as the core of what we need to build on.”\n\nSanders was a staunch supporter of Biden over the last four years but criticized the Democratic Party in the aftermath of Kamala Harris’ loss last fall, declaring that Trump’s victory was possible only because Democrats had “abandoned” the working class.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who introduced Sanders in Michigan, said more Democrats need to “follow his lead to focus on working-class people and working-class issues.”\n\n“They’ve got to take a hard look in the mirror, in my opinion, and decide who the hell they want to represent,” Fain said of Democrats. “We’ve been clear as a union, if they aren’t looking out for working-class people, we’re not going to be there for them.”\n\nThe voters speak\n\nThe voters who packed venues across Wisconsin and Michigan over the weekend composed a diverse group, including some who did not support Sanders’ past presidential campaigns. Most said that Democratic leaders have not done enough to stop Trump.\n\n“I’m here because I’m afraid for our country. The last six weeks have been horrible,” said Diana Schack, a 72-year-old retired lawyer who attended her first Sanders rally on Saturday. “I am becoming a more avid Bernie fan, especially in light of the work he’s doing traveling around the country. These are not normal times.”\n\nIn Kenosha the night before, Amber Schulz, a 50-year-old medical worker, demanded that her party “step up and do something.”\n\n“Bernie is the only politician I trust,” she said.\n\nTony Gonzales, 56, an independent from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said he’s worried that Trump will “dismantle historic American standards” and try to stay in office beyond this term. The Constitution bars presidents from serving more than two terms, even as Trump has suggested he deserves a third.\n\n“It’s a dangerous time right now,” Gonzales said. “What Bernie has to say — and the turnout — is important. His voice is still being heard.”\n\nSanders delivered the same fiery populist message over the weekend that he has for decades, seizing on the nation’s economic inequality to call for free health care, free public higher education and stronger social safety net programs. Sanders was especially focused on the team of billionaires Trump has appointed to serve as leaders in his administration, including Musk and a half dozen others.\n\n“They want to dismantle the federal government and cut programs that working people desperately need,” Sanders warned.\n\n“Yes, the oligarchs are enormously powerful. They have endless amounts of money. They control our economy.

(AP) — Bernie Sanders is standing alone on the back of a pickup truck shouting into a bullhorn.\n\nHe’s facing several hundred ecstatic voters huddled outside a suburban Detroit high school — the group that did not fit inside the high school’s gym or two overflow rooms. The crowd screams in delight when he tells them that a combined total of 9,000 people had shown up for the rally.\n\n“What all of this tells me, is not just in Michigan or in Vermont, the people of this country will not allow us to move toward oligarchy. They will not allow Trump to take us into authoritarianism,” Sanders yelled. “We’re prepared to fight. And we’re going to win.”\n\nAt 83 years old, Sanders is not running for president again. But the stooped and silver-haired democratic socialist has emerged as a leader of the resistance to Donald Trump’s second presidency. In tearing into Trump’s seizure of power and warning about the consequences of firing tens of thousands of government workers, Sanders is bucking the wishes of those who want Democrats to focus on the price of eggs or “roll over and play dead.”\n\nFor now, at least, Sanders stands alone as the only elected progressive willing to mount a national campaign to harness the fear and anger of the sprawling anti-Trump movement.\n\nHe drew a crowd of 4,000 in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on Friday night. He faced another 2,600 or so the next morning a few hours away in Altoona, Wisconsin, a town of less than 10,000 residents. And his crowd of 9,000 in suburban Detroit exceeded his own team’s expectations. By design, each stop was in a swing U.S. House district represented by a Republican.\n\nSanders, who was just elected to his fourth Senate term from Vermont, conceded that this is not the role he expected to play at this stage of his career.\n\nIn fact, his team intentionally waited in the early weeks of the Trump presidency to launch what they are now calling his “stop oligarchy tour” to see if a high-profile Democrat would fill the leadership void. Instead, Sanders — who is not a Democrat himself despite allying with Senate Democrats and running twice for the party’s presidential nomination — has people wondering if he’s considering another White House bid.\n\n“This is like presidential campaign rallies, isn’t it? But I’m not running for president, and this is not a campaign,” Sanders told The Associated Press. “You gotta do what you gotta do. The country’s in trouble and I want to play my role.”\n\nThe divided Democratic resistance\n\nSince losing the White House, Democrats across Washington have struggled to coalesce behind a consistent message or messenger to stop Trump’s aggressive moves to slash the government workforce, weaken federal oversight and empower tech titan Elon Musk to execute his vision.\n\nThere has been no centralized movement to organize the anti-Trump resistance.\n\n“You look around — who else is doing it? No one,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said of Sanders’ efforts. “My hope is that the dam will break in terms of Democrats going on the offense … We need to take the argument directly to the people.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a longtime Sanders ally, said she would join him on the road in the coming weeks. She’s also planning solo appearances in Republican-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York — and perhaps others in places where Republicans have declined to hold in-person town halls where they might face protests.\n\n“It’s not about whether Bernie should or shouldn’t be doing this. It’s about that we all should,” she said. “But he is unique in this country, and so long as we are blessed to have that capacity on our side, I think we should be thankful for it.”\n\nBeyond Sanders’ tour, angry voters have so far relied on grassroots groups like Indivisible to organize a series of local protests. They have been effective in pressuring Trump’s allies in some cases. A number of House Republicans facing angry questions have criticized Musk or questioned the cuts being carried out at his allies’ behest.\n\nIndivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who has been critical of many Democratic leaders, praised Sanders for stepping up.\n\n“I wish more Democrats were traveling the country, including to red states, to rally the the majority against Musk and Project 2025,” Levin said. “Sure as hell beats (House Democratic leader Hakeem) Jeffries traveling the country for his children’s book tour during a constitutional crisis.”\n\nDuring last month’s congressional recess, Jeffries made two appearances to promote a children’s book about democracy. He has also traveled to support House Democrats. This past weekend, he was in Selma, Alabama, to mark the 60th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n\nThe truth is that few, if any, Democratic leaders have the capacity to draw such crowds on short notice or organize the related logistics on a national scale. The party’s nascent class of 2028 presidential prospects, a group that includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, have limited national profiles and they have been reluctant to step too far into the national spotlight so far.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, among the more outspoken Trump critics in Congress, said that Democrats must be better organized.\n\n“People are desperate to be plugged into action right now. People see the threat. They are anxious and angry and motivated and they want to be sent in a direction to help,” he said.\n\nMurphy acknowledged that Sanders still has plenty of detractors within the Democratic Party who view him and his progressive policy ideas — replacing private and job-based health insurance with a government-funded “Medicare for All” plan, free public college, and the “Green New Deal” on climate policy — as too radical.\n\nIndeed, it was just five years ago when Democrats coalesced around Joe Biden to effectively block Sanders from winning the party’s 2020 presidential nomination.\n\n“There still are a lot of folks who view Bernie as a danger to the party,” Murphy said, “whereas I see his message as the core of what we need to build on.”\n\nSanders was a staunch supporter of Biden over the last four years but criticized the Democratic Party in the aftermath of Kamala Harris’ loss last fall, declaring that Trump’s victory was possible only because Democrats had “abandoned” the working class.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who introduced Sanders in Michigan, said more Democrats need to “follow his lead to focus on working-class people and working-class issues.”\n\n“They’ve got to take a hard look in the mirror, in my opinion, and decide who the hell they want to represent,” Fain said of Democrats. “We’ve been clear as a union, if they aren’t looking out for working-class people, we’re not going to be there for them.”\n\nThe voters speak\n\nThe voters who packed venues across Wisconsin and Michigan over the weekend composed a diverse group, including some who did not support Sanders’ past presidential campaigns. Most said that Democratic leaders have not done enough to stop Trump.\n\n“I’m here because I’m afraid for our country. The last six weeks have been horrible,” said Diana Schack, a 72-year-old retired lawyer who attended her first Sanders rally on Saturday. “I am becoming a more avid Bernie fan, especially in light of the work he’s doing traveling around the country. These are not normal times.”\n\nIn Kenosha the night before, Amber Schulz, a 50-year-old medical worker, demanded that her party “step up and do something.”\n\n“Bernie is the only politician I trust,” she said.\n\nTony Gonzales, 56, an independent from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said he’s worried that Trump will “dismantle historic American standards” and try to stay in office beyond this term. The Constitution bars presidents from serving more than two terms, even as Trump has suggested he deserves a third.\n\n“It’s a dangerous time right now,” Gonzales said. “What Bernie has to say — and the turnout — is important. His voice is still being heard.”\n\nSanders delivered the same fiery populist message over the weekend that he has for decades, seizing on the nation’s economic inequality to call for free health care, free public higher education and stronger social safety net programs. Sanders was especially focused on the team of billionaires Trump has appointed to serve as leaders in his administration, including Musk and a half dozen others.\n\n“They want to dismantle the federal government and cut programs that working people desperately need,” Sanders warned.\n\n“Yes, the oligarchs are enormously powerful. They have endless amounts of money. They control our economy. They own much of the media, and they have enormous influence over our political system,” he continued. “But from the bottom of my heart, I believe that if we stand together, we can beat them.”\n\nIt’s unclear how long that Sanders, an octogenarian who was hospitalized for a heart condition during his 2020 campaign, will continue in this role. A spokesperson said Sanders hasn’t had any health issues since the 2019 episode.\n\nHe is not expected to slow down anytime soon.

But he could have been referring to himself.\n\nAmerica’s momentum, spirit and pride has returned, the president told a joint session of Congress last week before touting his own re-election victory. \n\nIn the eight years since he was first elected and then re-elected, Trump was impeached twice, determined to be the “central cause” of the January 6 Capitol attack, convicted of 34 crimes in New York and held civilly liable for sexual abuse. Not to mention that he also faced criminal charges at state and federal levels, was accused repeatedly of past sexual misconduct and promoted baseless claims about Covid-19 treatments as thousands of Americans died on his watch. \n\nStill, the plurality of Americans voted him in for a historic non-consecutive second term. \n\n“Never been anything like it,” Trump said in his address. Historians have marked his comeback and he seems to be immune to most controversies that have brought down previous political figures or ended their careers. \n\nNow, other scandal-plagued politicians, such as Andrew Cuomo and Anthony Weiner, are trying to accomplish similar comebacks. Both men stepped down from their posts after being entrenched in scandal. It appeared, at the time, their careers were over. But, now they are trying to be like Trump and return to politics. Cuomo is running to be the next New York City mayor while Weiner is running for city council. \n\n“If Donald Trump can do it, why not us?” Larry Stuelpnagel, a clinical associate professor of journalism and political science at Northwestern University, told The Independent about the thinking. \n\nCuomo, then the governor of New York, resigned in 2021 after a barrage of sexual harassment allegations and claims that he undercounted deaths from Covid-19 in nursing homes. In the years since he stepped down, prosecutors have dropped criminal cases stemming from sexual misconduct accusations and ultimately never brought charges regarding his handling of the Covid-19 deaths. \n\n“But I would say both Cuomo and Weiner have a steeper hill to climb in their comebacks, particularly Weiner,” Stuelpnagel added.\n\nWeiner stepped down from Congress in 2011 after a sexting scandal came to light. He then pleaded guilty in 2017 to sending sexually explicit images to a 15-year-old girl, landing him in prison for 21 months. To make matters worse for Weiner, investigators searching through his laptop in 2016 found emails from his wife Huma Abedin, top aide to then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, prompting the FBI to reopen an inquiry into Clinton’s private email server days before the 2016 election. \n\nMany have since considered Weiner a factor in Clinton’s defeat to Trump.\n\nOne potential advantage for both of these candidates is name recognition. The upcoming races are potentially a test to see if the old adage is true: all press is good press. That hasn’t necessarily been true if scandal was involved. \n\nHistorically, “if there was a scandal, people would try and stay away from that person,” but now that “seems to be much less of an issue” as people become desensitized to scandal-plagued candidates, said Tabitha Bonilla, an associate professor of Human Development and Social Policy at Northwestern.\n\nRichard Nixon, for example, couldn’t have successfully won an election after Watergate, she said. “Now that we have this big example of a convicted felon running for president and winning, there just seems to be much more permissibility about people having comebacks.” \n\nThe New York mayor’s race takes that thinking to the extreme. As it currently stands, the two biggest names in the municipal race — Cuomo and Mayor Eric Adams — carry quite a bit of baggage. Federal prosecutors charged Adams with bribery and other counts in September. \n\nLast month, the Trump administration sought to dismiss the corruption charges after an alleged “quid pro quo.”\n\n“This is an incredibly unique race in and of itself, just given that the top two names on the list both have ties to negative things,” Bonilla said. She suspects the lesser-known candidates will emphasize they don’t have checkered pasts.\n\nTrump, the political comeback pioneer, has aided some Republicans with comebacks of their own.\n\nAs South Dakota governor, Kristi Noem released a memoir in which she admitted to fatally shooting her puppy. In the face of heavy public scrutiny, she refused to back down, even doubling down on her decision to kill her “worthless” wire-haired pointer. Her political career appeared to remain more or less unscathed. Although taken out of the running as a potential pick for vice president, just seven months after these revelations surfaced, he chose her to serve as his secretary of the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nTrump has also provided a political lifeline for failed 2024 presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The vaccine skeptic managed to survive being publicly outcast by his own famous family, admitting to driving around with a bear carcass and dumping it in Central Park and confessing to settling two “misconduct” cases during his Senate confirmation hearing to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nMatt Gaetz, however, didn’t have the same fate. The former Florida Republican Representative resigned from his post in Congress after Trump picked him to serve as his attorney general, leading the department that once investigated sex trafficking allegations against him. A Justice Department brought no charges against him, but he couldn’t escape the mountain of concerns and resurfaced allegations. Gaetz ultimately dropped his bid for AG, saying his run was “becoming a distraction.” \n\nPerhaps Gaetz’s case marks the limits of a potential comeback.\n\nIt raises questions as to whether other scandal-entrenched politicians -such as Al Franken, the former Minnesota Democrat who resigned amid sex misconduct claims, or George Santos, the serial fabulist who was expelled after federal prosecutors accused him with wire fraud - could make a comeback. \n\nWeiner and Cuomo are both Democrats and are unlikely to get a helping hand from Trump in their races, but they do all share something in common. \n\nTrump, Cuomo, and Weiner have all faced sexual misconduct allegations. Only Weiner was convicted criminally, Cuomo apologized for “making anyone feel uncomfortable” but denied touching anyone inappropriately. At the time of the 2024 election, 28 women had publicly accused Trump of sexual misconduct. He has denied any wrongdoing.\n\n“I think sex scandals have long been an area where the public has downplayed the [potential] culpability” of alleged perpetrators, Bonilla said, pointing to Bill Clinton, who was impeached but not removed from office after his affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.\n\n“There is a tendency for people either to minimize what's happened or to kind of pay much more attention” to the person-in-question’s other, more positive contributions, she added. \n\nThis phenomenon appears to already be playing out. Democratic New York Rep. Richie Torres has already backed Cuomo, telling the New York Post last week that he wasn’t interested in “relitigating” Cuomo’s resignation amid the sexual misconduct allegations. \n\n“I predict the comeback story of the 2025 election will be the resurrection of Andrew Cuomo,” he told the outlet.\n\nIt’s difficult to piece together the confluence of factors that could have led to Trump’s comeback: Joe Biden’s delayed exit from the 2024 race. Kamala Harris’ standing as the first Black woman and first Asian American nominee for president on a major party ticket. The massive socio-cultural shifts that sprung up in response to Trump’s term — like Black Lives Matter protests or the #MeToo movement. Trump’s popularity among the GOP. Rapid inflation. \n\nMaybe Trump’s resurgence largely hinged on messaging.\n\nThe Trump campaign co-opted the negative press and turned it into strategy. His mugshots were slapped onto Trump-branded merchandise and sold to support his campaign. He accused federal prosecutors of “weaponizing” the Justice Department against him and repeatedly branded the probes into him as “witch hunts.”\n\nFor Stuelpnagel, a particular quote often attributed to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels came to mind: “A lie told once remains a lie. A lie repeated 1,000 times becomes a fact.” Trump has essentially told so many falsehoods — amplified on the world stage — so many times that, at least to some, they’re now considered a fact, he said. \n\n“Trump has been able to repeat, repeat, repeat. He's had some very willing allies in the form of, most prominently, Fox News… and right-wing influencers who don't do fact checking,” Stuelpnagel said. \n\nTo put things in perspective, after the president’s 99-minute speech to Congress Tuesday, the New York Times fact-checked his remarks, marking more than a dozen claims as baseless, misleading or exaggerated.\n\nCuomo and Weiner don’t enjoy that kind of round-the-clock news coverage.\n\nTo add to the information problem, young voters have gravitated toward getting their news from non-traditional outlets such as social media and podcasts. \n\n“The mainstream press has really lost its touch with a lot of young voters. Stuelpnagel said. “He ran a smart campaign by avoiding the mainstream media and going to the so-called influencers who never really fact-checked him, never really challenged him.”\n\nDifferent strategies and circumstances define the New York races for Cuomo and Weiner. The primary elections are held in June, when voters will decide if the two can unstick themselves from their past scandals or if “Teflon Don” stands as the lone exception. He did, after all, write The Art of the Comeback. \n\nReferring to the first of what would be six bankruptcies, he wrote in the 1997 book: “There were some dark moments. But I never had any doubt that I'd come back.”","summary":"Donald Trump’s 2024 re-election victory may have ushered in an era of political resurgence, as former New York Gov.

Climate United Fund, a coalition of three nonprofit groups, demanded access to a Citibank account it had received through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a program created in 2022 by the bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act and more commonly known as the \"green bank.\" The freeze threatens its ability to issue loans and even pay employees, the group said. “The combined actions of Citibank and EPA effectively nullify a congressionally mandated and funded program,\" Climate United wrote in a Monday court filing. Last April, then-Vice President Kamala Harris announced that the EPA had selected eight groups, including Maryland-based Climate United, to receive $20 billion to finance tens of thousands of projects to fight climate change and promote environmental justice. The money was formally awarded in August. While favored by congressional Democrats, the green bank drew immediate criticism from Republicans, who routinely denounced it as an unaccountable \"slush fund.'' Former EPA Administrator Michael Regan sharply disputed that claim. The bank was quickly targeted by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was confirmed to the role in late January. In a video posted on X, Zeldin said the EPA would revoke contracts for the still-emerging program. Zeldin cited a conservative journalist’s undercover video made late last year that showed a former EPA employee saying the agency was throwing “gold bars off the Titanic” — presumably a reference to spending before the start of Trump’s second term. Zeldin has repeatedly used the term “gold bars” to accuse the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund's recipients of misconduct, waste and possible fraud. According to the lawsuit filed in federal court, Citibank cut off access to Climate United’s bank account on Feb. 18 — an action the bank did not explain for weeks. The cutoff took place as Zeldin made multiple public appearances accusing Climate United and other groups of misconduct, eventually announcing that the funds were frozen, according to the lawsuit. Climate United said the EPA has refused to meet with the group. Several Democratic lawmakers slammed Zeldin's attacks on the green bank. “The Trump administration’s malicious and unfounded attacks on the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund have resulted in a sham investigation and unsubstantiated funding freeze,” Maryland Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey and Michigan Rep. Debbie Dingell said in a statement. The three Democrats had pushed for the creation of the green bank. Citibank said it was reviewing the lawsuit. “As we’ve said previously, Citi has been working with the federal government in its efforts to address government officials’ concerns regarding this federal grant program,\" the bank said in a statement Monday. \"Our role as financial agent does not involve any discretion over which organizations receive grant funds. Citi will of course comply with any judicial decision.” The EPA declined to comment, citing pending litigation. In its court filing, Climate United pointed to the resignation of a former prosecutor in the U.S. attorney’s Washington office after refusing demands from top Trump administration officials to freeze the group's assets. Zeldin raised questions in a letter to the agency's watchdog about the EPA’s use of Citibank to hold the money, a structure that allowed the eight entities to be used as “pass throughs” for eventual grant recipients. The process undermined transparency, Zeldin alleged. He also questioned the qualifications of some of the entities overseeing the grants and said some were affiliated with the Biden administration or Democratic politics, including Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic nominee for Georgia governor. Trump singled out Abrams over her ties to the green bank in his address to Congress last week. In a letter to EPA officials on March 4, Climate United disputed Zeldin's allegations. The group’s lengthy application material is publicly available and the EPA used a rigorous selection process, Climate United said, adding that its spending is transparent. In addition to Climate United, the new fund has awarded money to other nonprofits, including the Coalition for Green Capital, Power Forward Communities, Opportunity Finance Network, Inclusiv and the Justice Climate Fund. Those organizations have partnered with a range of groups, including Rewiring America, Habitat for Humanity and the Community Preservation Corporation. The EPA's former inspector general had urged more oversight of the green bank program. “The rapid implementation of the program, combined with the relatively narrow window of availability for such a significant amount of funding, may lead the EPA to expend the funds without fully establishing the internal controls that mitigate the risk of fraud, waste and abuse,” then-Inspector General Sean O'Donnell told Congress in 2023. Trump fired O’Donnell in January, along with more than a dozen other inspectors general. Acting Inspector General Nicole Murley has said she is looking into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

President Trump was furious over the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Harris in October, in the closing weeks of the campaign. The president and other conservatives chided CBS after it was revealed that \"60 Minutes\" producers had edited Harris' jumbled response to a question about the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war. Trump sued CBS for $20 billion, claiming the edits amounted to election interference. The president has demanded \"a lot\" of money to settle the case, which many 1st Amendment experts call \"frivolous.\" The controversy over the \"60 Minutes\" edits wound up before the FCC last fall when a conservative nonprofit group, the Center for American Rights, filed a news distortion complaint against CBS and its flagship television station, WCBS-TV, in New York. \"CBS distorted the news by using its slice-and-dice method of journalism to justify cleaning up the Vice President’s muddled and meandering answer,\" the center said in a filing with the FCC, arguing that \"60 Minutes\" producers had become \"the vice president's cleanup crew.\" The FCC, until recently, has typically taken a hands-off approach to complaints about editorial decisions, and court cases have set a high bar for such claims. The FCC has said it would \"only investigate claims that include evidence showing that the broadcast news report was deliberately intended to mislead viewers.\" The Center for American Rights lodged its FCC complaint in mid-October, ahead of Trump filing his lawsuit against CBS in federal court in Texas. The lawsuit is pending. CBS has asked a judge to dismiss the matter or move the case to New York, where CBS is based. The two sides also have agreed to the judge's request that they present their arguments to a mediator. \"The complaint filed against CBS for 'news distortion' envisions a less free world in which the federal government becomes a roving censor — one that second guesses and even punishes specific editorial decisions that are an essential part of producing news programming,\" the Paramount Global-owned network argued Monday in its response to the FCC inquiry. Late last year, the Democratic former FCC chairwoman threw out complaints filed against CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox. But Trump's pick to lead the agency, Brendan Carr, quickly revived the CBS, NBC and ABC complaints. First Amendment experts sounded alarms, saying the FCC was wading into treacherous territory in reviewing debate formats and decisions made by news producers. Carr demanded that CBS turn over the raw transcript and unedited interview, which it did. Video of the unedited interview, released last month by the FCC and separately by CBS, confirmed the network's account. But the release also highlighted that Harris' convoluted answer had been clipped to its most succinct and cogent sentence. \"The essence of the Complaint — that CBS somehow broke the law by airing a portion, but not all, of a candidate’s answer to a question in a news magazine program — is fatally flawed,\" CBS said in its petition. News organizations routinely edit interviews, removing extraneous words and redundant phrases. The practice has long been accepted as long as the edits don't change the context or meaning. CBS noted the U.S. Supreme Court has never \"recognized a sweeping right by the government to second guess editorial decision-making.\" An FCC ruling against the network \"would set a dangerous precedent that would enable the federal government to chill news coverage deemed unfavorable to whichever party were in power at a given moment in time,\" CBS said. But Daniel Suhr, president of the center, said Monday that broadcasters with FCC licenses, including CBS, have a duty to act in the public interest. \"CBS's behavior here underlines why the public no longer trusts the supposed trustees of the public's airwaves,\" Suhr said. The \"60 Minutes\" case has sparked clashes within Paramount. Journalists have called on the company to defend its flagship broadcast and journalists' 1st Amendment rights. Paramount's controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, has agitated for the Trump lawsuit to be settled to clear the way for her sale of the company to David Ellison's Skydance Media. The $8-billion transaction requires the approval of the FCC. Lawyers say Trump would have had a difficult time arguing the \"60 Minutes\" interview harmed him because the question did not reference him. Instead, it was about the Biden administration. Trump has said he thinks certain TV stations should lose their FCC licenses. The \"60 Minutes\" did not appear to diminish Trump's standing among voters; he was elected president a month later.","summary":"CBS argued that the news distortion complaint should be dismissed, saying the U.S. Supreme Court has never 'recognized a sweeping right by the government to second guess editorial decision-making.'","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-03-10/cbs-defends-1st-amendment-fcc-review-of-60-minutes-edits-trump-brendan-carr","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/c470fdc/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4497x2361+0+319/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa8%2F2f%2F1f9b41e34513b07a1393fd4260bd%2Felection-2024-trump-","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 17:15:20","author":"Meg James","authors":["Meg James"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.457},{"id":298716660,"title":"World News | EPA Froze 'green Bank' Funds Worth Billions, Climate Group Suit Says","text":"Washington, Mar 10 (AP) A nonprofit that was awarded nearly $7 billion by the Biden administration to finance clean energy and climate-friendly projects has sued President Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency, accusing it of improperly freezing a legally awarded grant. Climate United Fund, a coalition of three nonprofit groups, demanded access to a Citibank account it received through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, a programme created in 2022 by the bipartisan Inflation Reduction Act and more commonly known as the green bank. The freeze threatens its ability to issue loans and even pay employees, he group said.

Last April, then-Vice President Kamala Harris announced that EPA had selected eight groups, including Maryland-based Climate United, to receive $20 billion to finance tens of thousands of projects to fight climate change and promote environmental justice. The money was formally awarded in August. Also Read | PM Modi Mauritius Visit: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Mauritius Connection, a 27-Year-Old Bond. While favoured by congressional Democrats, the green bank drew immediate criticism from Republicans, who routinely denounced it as an unaccountable \"slush fund\". Former EPA Administrator Michael Regan sharply disputed that claim. The bank was quickly targeted by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, who was confirmed to the role in late January. In a video posted on X, Zeldin said the EPA would revoke contracts for the still-emerging programme. Zeldin cited a conservative journalist's undercover video made late last year that showed a former EPA employee saying the agency was throwing “gold bars off the Titanic” – presumably a reference to spending before the start of Trump's second term. Zeldin has repeatedly used the term “gold bars” to accuse the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund's recipients of misconduct, waste and possible fraud. According to the lawsuit filed in federal court, Citibank cut off access to Climate United's bank account on February 18 — an action the bank did not explain for weeks. The cutoff took place as Zeldin made multiple public appearances accusing Climate United and other groups of misconduct, eventually announcing that the funds were frozen, according to the lawsuit. Climate United said the EPA has refused to meet with the group. Several Democratic lawmakers slammed Zeldin's attacks on the green bank. “The Trump administration's malicious and unfounded attacks on the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund have resulted in a sham investigation and unsubstantiated funding freeze,” Maryland Senator Chris Van Hollen, Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey and Michigan Representative Debbie Dingell said in a statement. The three Democrats pushed for creation of the green bank. Citibank said it was reviewing the lawsuit. “As we've said previously, Citi has been working with the federal government in its efforts to address government officials' concerns regarding this federal grant programme,\" the bank said in a statement Monday. \"Our role as financial agent does not involve any discretion over which organisations receive grant funds. Citi will of course comply with any judicial decision.” The EPA declined to comment, citing pending litigation. In its court filing, Climate United pointed to the resignation of a former prosecutor in the US Attorney's Washington office after refusing demands from top Trump administration officials to freeze the group's assets. Zeldin raised questions in a letter to the agency's watchdog about the EPA's use of Citibank to hold the money, a structure that allowed the eight entities to be used as “pass throughs” for eventual grant recipients. The process undermined transparency, Zeldin alleged. He also questioned the qualifications of some of the entities overseeing the grants and said some were affiliated with the Biden administration or Democratic politics, including Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic nominee for Georgia governor. Trump singled out Abrams over her ties to the green bank in his address to Congress last week. In a letter to EPA officials on March 4, Climate United disputed Zeldin's allegations. The group's lengthy application material is publicly available and the EPA used a rigorous selection process, Climate United said, adding that its spending is transparent. In addition to Climate United, the new fund has awarded money to other non-profits, including the Coalition for Green Capital, Power Forward Communities, Opportunity Finance Network, Inclusiv and the Justice Climate Fund. Those organisations have partnered with a range of groups, including Rewiring America, Habitat for Humanity and the Community Preservation Corporation. The EPA's former inspector general had urged more oversight of the green-bank programme. “The rapid implementation of the programme, combined with the relatively narrow window of availability for such a significant amount of funding, may lead the EPA to expend the funds without fully establishing the internal controls that mitigate the risk of fraud, waste, and abuse,” then-inspector general Sean O'Donnell told Congress in 2023. Trump fired O'Donnell in January, along with more than a dozen other inspectors general. Acting Inspector General Nicole Murley has said she is looking into the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

But they can't leave until a different SpaceX ship brings a new team of astronauts to the space station to replace the stranded duo. \n\nThat mission, called Crew-10, will launch on March 12. Its four-astronaut crew is expected to board the ISS on March 13. \n\nThe four astronauts are expected to depart about three days after the Crew-10 mission delivers\nTypically, a departing ISS crew shares the space station with the incoming crew for about five days in what's known as a 'handover period.' This allows them to get the new crew up to speed on space station operations and ensures a smooth transition. \nBut this time, NASA has decided to shorten the handover period to just two days to conserve food on board the ISS and open up more undocking opportunities for the Starliner crew in case the weather interferes with their March 16 return. \n\nThe news of their hastened homecoming was probably well-received by Williams and Wilmore's families, who have spent the last 278 days without their loved ones.\n\nNASA astronauts Barry Wilmore (left), Sunita Williams (right), Nick Hague (center right) and Russian cosmonaut Aleksandr Gorbunov (center left) should return from the ISS on March 16 \n\nWhen the pair launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5, they were only supposed to spend eight days on the ISS. \n\nBut a series of technical issues with Starliner, including thruster failures and helium leaks, ultimately drove NASA to send the faulty spacecraft home without its crew in September. \n\nWilliams and Wilmore have been living on the ISS ever since. \n\nThe crew's delayed return recently entered the political spotlight after SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk and President Donald Trump claimed the astronauts were 'abandoned' in space by the Biden administration for 'political reasons.'\n\nMusk has said that the former president rejected his offer to bring the Starliner crew home earlier because it would have made Donald Trump 'look good.'\n\nMusk backed Trump during the 2024 presidential race, donating $288 million to his campaign and appearing at several MAGA rallies.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk claimed the Biden administration rejected his offer to bring the Starliner astronauts home sooner to avoid making Trump 'look good.'\n\nHe explained that the former administration did not want to jeopardize Kamala Harris' presidential campaign and intentionally 'pushed the return date past the inauguration date.'\n\nBy the time they get home, Williams and Wilmore will have spent 284 days in space\n\nThe Starliner and Crew-9 astronauts will leave the ISS about three days after the Crew-10 mission delivers Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi (L to R), NASA astronaut Nichole Ayers, Russian cosmonaut Kiril Peskov and NASA astronaut Anne McClain to the space station\n\nMusk also noted that the Biden administration was suing SpaceX at the time.\n\nNASA officials have not directly addressed these claims. \n\nBut during the Friday press briefing, Ken Bowersox, associate administrator of the agency's Space Operation Mission Directorate, said SpaceX has been working with NASA to develop a backup return plan for the Starliner mission since last July.\n\n'The SpaceX folks helped us with a lot of options for how we would bring Butch and Suni home on Dragon in a contingency,' Bowersox said \n\n'When it comes to adding on missions, or bringing a capsule home early, those were always options. But we ruled them out pretty quickly just based on how much money we've got in our budget, and the importance of keeping crews on the International Space Station. They're an important part of maintaining the station.' \n\nAny discussions about alternative backup plans were held within NASA, officials said, so it's unclear why Musk claimed to have spoken directly to the Biden administration about rescuing the astronauts sooner.\n\nThere is no way to verify whether this actually occurred, but if it did, it would appear that the Biden administration never communicated Musk's offer to NASA decisionmakers. \n\nUltimately, NASA decided to send SpaceX's Crew-9 mission to the ISS with just two astronauts — NASA's Nick Hague and Russia's Aleksandr Gorbunov — even though the Dragon spacecraft is equipped with four seats. \n\n'It takes a full crew to continuously crew the space station, both for science and for maintenance, and that is the work that we're looking forward to doing when we get to the space station,' NASA astronaut and Crew-10 mission commander Anne McClain said Friday\n\nCrew-9 arrived at the ISS a few weeks after Starliner was sent home without Williams and Wilmore in September. It has been docked to the ISS ever since, with its two extra seats reserved for the Starliner crew.\n\n'When we looked at the situation at the time, we had a Crew-9 launch in front of us. It made sense to take the opportunity to bring Crew-9 up with just two seats and have Butch and Suni fill in, and do the rest of the long-duration mission,' ISS program manager Dana Weigel explained during the Friday press briefing.\n\nBut before the Starliner and Crew-9 astronauts can leave the ISS, SpaceX's Crew-10 mission must deliver a new team of astronauts to replace them. \n\nDoctor: How NASA's stranded astronauts will be stretchered to hospital in shocking scenes before brutal rehab\n\nThat team includes NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers as well as Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.\n\nCrew-10 is scheduled to launch at 7:48pm ET on Wednesday, March 12 from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, NASA officials announced Friday. \n\nIf the launch goes according to plan, the Crew-10 Dragon capsule should dock to the ISS at roughly 10am ET on Thursday, March 13. \n\nOnce the Crew-10 astronauts board the space station, they will begin their shortened, two-day handover period with Crew-9. \n\nAfter the handover period concludes, the earliest undocking opportunity for the Crew-9 Dragon capsule will be March 16, pending the weather conditions at their potential splashdown locations. \n\nIf the weather looks good, the Starliner and Crew-9 astronauts will board the Dragon spacecraft, undock from the ISS and head back to Earth. \n\nBy the time they get home, Williams and Wilmore will have spent 284 days in space. \n\nShare or comment on this article:\nStranded NASA astronauts' return date is changed AGAIN\n\nAdd comment","summary":"NASA officials announced Friday that the return date for the Starliner astronauts  has changed again.

Now, just weeks after taking office, Trump shared a new message for followers who might be asking why those prices haven’t come down: “Shut up about egg prices.”\n\nAlthough Trump did not say those words exactly, he did share an opinion piece on social media this weekend that featured that phrase in the headline. The opinion was written in February by right-wing pundit Charlie Kirk and appeared on The Daily Caller. \n\nThe president himself did not comment on the article, but it was shared by Trump on his Truth Social page which has more than 9.2 million followers. \n\nThe message offers a stark contrast to the promises Trump made on the campaign trail and in interviews following his win in November’s Presidential election. Trump often criticized Democratic nominee Kamala Harris for the rising costs of groceries and said he would lower prices on Day 1. \n\nIn an interview on NBC’‘s “Meet the Press” following his election that was broadcast on Dec. 8, Trump bragged about how effective the messaging around grocery prices was for his campaign. \n\n“When you buy apples, when you buy bacon, when you buy eggs, they would double and triple the price over a short period of time, and I won an election based on that,” Trump said. “We’re going to bring those prices way down.”\n\nBut egg prices have only increased since Trump took office. Last month, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced the average cost of a dozen eggs in the U.S. for January 2025 was a record high $4.95. The cost of other groceries tracked by the bureau -- oranges, bananas, ground chuck, milk, tomatoes and more -- shows prices remained relatively flat or experienced a very minimal change in cost. \n\nA report issued last month by the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts the cost of groceries in general will rise in 2025 by about 3.4 percent. While some items may end up being less expensive, the report suggested beef, pork, fresh fruit, sugar, and eggs will increase in cost. In particular, eggs are expected to jump by 41.1 percent and could cost $7 a dozen on average at some point this year. \n\nAround the same time Trump spoke with “Meet the Press,” he also told Time Magazine that he wasn’t sure if he could lower grocery prices. \n\n“I’d like to bring them down. It’s hard to bring things down once they’re up. You know, it’s very hard,” Trump said.\n\nThe next Consumer Price Index report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics is set to be released Wednesday.","summary":"Trump campaigned on a promise of lowering the cost of groceries, but so far, has been unable to lower prices.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/03/trump-shares-message-to-millions-struggling-to-buy-groceries-shut-up-about-egg-prices.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/4QMI65S5TFAXTKXQ6P6EKYLVE4.jpg?auth=57dd07721cbabd4b1051a62f1b219406ac3248169fabb0d00567b150f47c664f&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 16:35:33","author":"Matt Durr","authors":["Matt Durr"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.056},{"id":298697712,"title":"House Republicans demand data about Dem fundraiser ActBlue amid accusations of fraud","text":"WASHINGTON — House Republicans are demanding data from the US Treasury Department that will reveal whether fraudulent campaign contributions were made on an online fundraising platform that has funneled billions of dollars to Democratic candidates in recent election cycles.\n\nGOP lawmakers on the House Oversight and House Administration committees fired off a letter to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday, requesting all suspicious transactions to lefty fundraising juggernaut ActBlue from Jan. 1, 2023.\n\n“The Committees remain concerned with recent reports suggesting fraud and evasion of campaign finance law by individuals exploiting online contribution platforms, especially ActBlue,” wrote Oversight Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.), Administration Chairman Bryan Steil (R-Wis.) and Rep. Nick Langworthy (R-NY).\n\n“Until recently, ActBlue had not implemented standard procedures to guard against identity theft and fraud, such as by requiring a Card Verification Value (CVV) to process online transactions,” they said.\n\n“The organization is also the subject of several state-level investigations stemming from allegedly fraudulent contributions made via the platform without the reported contributors’ awareness — serious allegations that, if proven true, would violate federal law.”\n\n“[B]ad actors, including foreign nationals,” may also have illegally donated via unwitting straw donors, according to the House GOPers, who believe those and other so-called “dummy” accounts have proliferated on ActBlue.\n\nA memo obtained by The Post in October shows that the Treasury Department had already identified “hundreds” of Suspicious Activity Reports possibly implicating ActBlue.\n\nBut the Republican lawmakers told Bessent that former President Joe Biden’s Treasury Department had “stalled” document queries “for months” — and in Secretary Janet Yellen’s final months had let them “review only limited documents.”\n\n“We write to request Treasury, in its commitment to transparency and cooperation, provide both Committees with the remaining records relevant to our investigations,” added Comer, Steil and Langworthy.\n\nActBlue helped contribute nearly $2 billion in the 2023-24 campaign to Democratic candidates and causes — with $46.7 million channeled directly to Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign within hours of her succeeding Biden as the nominee.\n\nIn total, it’s helped raise more than $16 billion since 2004.\n\nUntil last year, the platform did not require CVVs for online transactions with debit cards, credit cards or prepaid gift cards — and some donors made contributions well beyond their means or to the opposite party from the one they usually back, the House GOP probe found.\n\nThe probe also showed that, in some instances, hundreds of $2.50 donations to ActBlue have come from the same individual.\n\nIn addition to the Republican-led probe, GOP state attorneys general in Missouri, Texas and Wyoming have also looked into ActBlue’s potentially fraudulent fundraising this year over similar allegations of fraudulent fundraising.\n\nA Wisconsin Republican strategist also alleged last year in an explosive racketeering lawsuit against ActBlue that it stole his identity to make 385 fraudulent contributions to liberal groups — including Vice President Kamala Harris’ super PAC.\n\nMark Block, who served as chief of staff to 2012 GOP presidential hopeful Herman Cain, claimed in the suit that $884.38 was given in his name between May and October 2024, with the individual donations falling under $200 thus circumventing any filing with the Federal Election Commission (FEC).\n\nAt least seven senior ActBlue officials resigned from their posts in late February, The New York Times reported, amid internal disagreement, worrying Democratic groups and allies such as labor unions.\n\nThe Post has reached out to the platform and the Treasury Department for comment.","summary":"GOP lawmakers on the House Oversight and

Signatures Spark MAGA Anger: 'Null and Void'","text":"The MAGA community is furious over reports that former President Joe Biden used an autopen—a mechanical device that replicates signatures—to sign several official White House documents during his time in office.The Oversight Project, an arm of the right-wing think tank behind Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation, published a report last week claiming that Biden used an \"autopen signature\" across almost \"every document we could find.\"For the organization, Biden's use of the autopen to sign official documents would cast doubt over the former president's ability to lead the country. \"WHOEVER CONTROLLED THE AUTOPEN CONTROLLED THE PRESIDENCY,\" the Oversight Project wrote on X, formerly Twitter.Newsweek reached out to the Heritage Foundation via email for comment on Monday.Why It MattersBiden's final years in office and his run for reelection were marred by concerns over his age and mental acuity, exacerbated by his penchant for gaffes, stumbles, and missteps and several public episodes where the former president appeared frail and confused.After reassuring voters that he was in perfect physical and mental form to beat Donald Trump and take on four more years in the White House, Biden eventually bowed to pressure from fellow Democrats and withdrew from the race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris.After Trump's triumph in November, several reports pointed the finger at Biden's aides for trying to conceal the severity of the situation.What To KnowThe Oversight Project did not share many details on its alleged investigation, including the number of documents reviewed, but wrote on X: \"We gathered every document we could find with Biden's signature over the course of his presidency.\"It added, sharing three

Even though several fast-paced changes by the administration have been witnessed in the country, a few bad moves have also impacted the political scenario. In recent news, an Ohio woman has been fired from her job and left seeking donations to survive after she left a rude and racist message to a waiter who served a group at a Mexican restaurant in the city.\n\nAs per reports, waiter Ricardo Nonato, who happens to be an American citizen, had just wrapped up serving the $87 meal at Cazuela’s Bar & Grill in Columbus, Ohio. When he went to check the bill, he found a rude note. In the section where the amount of the tip is usually written, the customer wrote, “ZERO, YOU SUCK.” The abuse continued with “I HOPE TRUMP DEPORTS YOU!!!” written below.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nShocked? Well, can we call it Donald Trump’s influence? Probably. The 78-year-old president has previously claimed many uncalled rude and racial jabs in his speeches, aiming at former vice president Kamala Harris, whose parents happen to be of Indian origin.\n\nKnown for his sharp mouth, he also insulted many other people publicly in his addresses. Moreover, since his return to office, Trump has deported thousands of undocumented illegal migrants from the country.\n\nAccording to the Irish Star, after Nonato posted the bill image online, the customer was identified as 49-year-old Stephanie Lovins. The woman worked at Century 21, a real estate firm from which she was fired after the incident. \n\nFollowing the backlash, an agent for Century 21 wrote, “Thank you for bringing this to our attention. The CENTURY 21 brand does not condone acts of discrimination and is taking this situation seriously. We have looked into it, and the agent in question is no longer associated with the brand,” a representative wrote in a follow-up comment online.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nMeanwhile, Stephanie Lovins deleted all her social media profiles after the incident, but just before that, she posted on her Facebook page that her credit card was stolen. In addition, people at Cazuela’s Bar & Grill confirmed that Ricardo has two jobs. He was serving Lovins when she came, and she was unhappy about a coupon. \n\nAfter the incident, GoFundMe seemed to be looking to raise money for ‘Stephanie’s Path to Accountability, Reformation, and Second Chance.’ On the page, it was written that Stephanie regrets the mistake she made, and it was only in the heat of anger that she wrote something silly; the mistake has cost her career and her real estate license, and now she’s struggling to rebuild her life. Hence, this page worked as a source of aid for her. However, the alleged page was reportedly taken down later.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Diet Prada ™ (@diet_prada) \n\nAs per Travel Insider, tipping is an optional choice in America. However, since most waiters are well-trained and knowledgeable, a 20 to 25 percent gratuity on top of the bill (before sales tax) is standard. Sometimes, people may leave a restaurant with zero tips, but that’s very unusual. What do you think about the increased incidents of gender and racial discrimination in the U.S.?

She also served as the deputy editorial page editor and is recognized for her analysis on Supreme Court decisions and political issues.\n\nMarcus’ resignation comes as the Washington Post is reportedly undergoing a major newsroom reorganization aimed at expanding coverage and attracting a broader audience, according to a memo from executive editor Matt Murray.\n\nAs part of the overhaul, the national desk will be split into two sections: one dedicated to national reporting and another focused on politics and government, according to the news site Axios.\n\nThe latter will include most of the Post’s political journalists and absorb the Business section’s Economics and Economic Policy team.\n\nMeanwhile, a newly formed department will combine business, technology, health, science and climate reporting.\n\nMurray also announced efforts to prioritize digital content, appointing senior editors for audience growth and visuals in each department. \n\nA dedicated print leader will oversee the newspaper, separating it from digital operations.\n\nAcknowledging potential challenges, Murray admitted, “It may not be for everyone,” but stressed that the reinvention is necessary as the Post adapts to financial struggles and declining readership.\n\nThe New York Post has sought comment from the Washington Post.

The letter was first reported by The New York Times. \n\nAs of publication, no communication of Marcus’ resignation had been sent to the Post newsroom, according to internal sources. A spokesperson for the paper did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMarcus quitting the Post after more than four decades with the publication comes roughly a week after the paper’s mega-billionaire owner sparked outrage among the paper’s staff and subscription base when he handed down a new direction for the Post’s opinion page. \n\n“We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” Bezos noted in his memo to staff. “We’ll cover other topics too, of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”\n\nThe Amazon founder also revealed that opinion editor David Shipley had decided to step down rather than embrace Bezos' new edict. “I suggested to him that if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no.’ After careful consideration, David decided to step away,” Bezos stated. “This is a significant shift, it won’t be easy, and it will require 100 per cent commitment — I respect his decision.”\n\nIn her resignation letter, Marcus wrote that she “cherished my four decades at the Post” and stated that as an opinion writer, she had been “honored to offer commentary that readers could be assured constituted my best independent judgment of the topic at hand.” Lewis’ rejection of her latest op-ed that denounced Bezos’ new opinion policy, however, was a bridge too far.\n\n“Unfortunately, on the opinions side of the newspaper, that appears to be no longer the case,” Marcus wrote. “Jeff’s announcement that the opinion section will henceforth not publish views that deviate from the pillars of individual liberties and free markets threatens to break the trust of readers that columnists are writing what they believe, not what the owner has deemed acceptable.”\n\nShe continued: “Will’s decision to not run the column that I wrote respectfully dissenting from Jeff’s edict — something that I have not experienced in almost two decades of column-writing — underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded.”\n\nShe concluded her letter to the Post’s owner and publisher by telling them “it breaks my heart to conclude that I must leave,” adding that she had the “deepest affection and admiration” for her colleagues and wished them “the best as you steer this storied and critical institution through troubled times.”\n\nBezos’ recent mandate comes after the Blue Origin owner has faced heat from both the newsroom and readers from seemingly cozying up to President Donald Trump and pushing the paper into a more conservative direction. His decision to scuttle the publication’s endorsement of Democratic nominee Kamala Harris just days before the 2024 election resulted in editorial board members resigning and roughly a quarter-million canceled subscriptions. \n\nAmid additional concerns over Bezos’ editorial meddling and increasingly close relationship with the media-hating president, the paper has seen an exodus of talent from both the news and opinion side. The newsroom has also begged Bezos to come and personally speak to the Post’s journalists about his vision, to no avail.\n\nFollowing Bezos’ latest edict, which has been met with approval from MAGA and Trump, NPR reported that an additional 75,000 readers canceled their digital subscriptions to the paper.","summary":"Ruth Marcus said that the publisher’s decision to spike her column ‘underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bezos-washington-post-columnist-resigns-ruth-marcus-b2712323.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/27/16/jeffbezonwp.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 15:57:27","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.041},{"id":298703648,"title":"Dem governor to headline major fundraiser in key presidential primary state stoking 2028 speculation","text":"In a move that is sure to spark 2028 speculation, the New Hampshire Democratic Party on Monday announced that Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker this spring will headline their largest annual fundraiser. Pritzker, the two-term governor of blue state Illinois, will deliver the keynote address at the New Hampshire Democrats' McIntyre-Shaheen 100 Club Dinner on April 27 in Manchester, the state's largest city. The governor, a member of the Pritzker family that owns the Hyatt hotel chain and who has started several of his own venture capital and investment startups, is seen as a potential contender for the 2028 Democratic Party presidential nomination. And trips to New Hampshire – which for over a century has held the first primary in the race for the White House – are seen as an early indicator of a politician's interest in running for the presidency in the next election. The 60-year-old Pritzker has been one of his party's leaders in opposing President Donald Trump's second-term agenda. THESE ARE THE DEMOCRATS WHO MAY RUN FOR THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2028 Pritzker, along with Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, late last year launched a group called Governors Safeguarding Democracy, in order to resist the Trump administration. Their move came in the wake of last November's elections, when the Democrats lost the White House and their Senate majority, and failed to win back control of the House of Representatives.

That decision led to an outcry from several WaPo staffers and mainstream journalists, with former WaPo executive editor Marty Baron saying he was “sad and disgusted” over it; Opinion section editor David Shipley also quit the paper following Bezos’ decision.\n\nMarcus had been at the Washington Post since 1984, where she covered the White House and Supreme Court for years before joining the paper’s editorial board in 2003; she started writing her opinion columns in 2006.

The crowd screams in delight when he tells them that a combined total of 9,000 people had shown up for the rally.\n\n“What all of this tells me, is not just in Michigan or in Vermont, the people of this country will not allow us to move toward oligarchy.

And his crowd of 9,000 in suburban Detroit exceeded his own team’s expectations. By design, each stop was in a swing U.S. House district represented by a Republican.\n\nSanders, who was just elected to his fourth Senate term from Vermont, conceded that this is not the role he expected to play at this stage of his career.\n\nIn fact, his team intentionally waited in the early weeks of the Trump presidency to launch what they are now calling his “stop oligarchy tour” to see if a high-profile Democrat would fill the leadership void. Instead, Sanders — who is not a Democrat himself despite allying with Senate Democrats and running twice for the party’s presidential nomination — has people wondering if he’s considering another White House bid.\n\n“This is like presidential campaign rallies, isn’t it? But I’m not running for president, and this is not a campaign,” Sanders told The Associated Press. “You gotta do what you gotta do. The country’s in trouble and I want to play my role.”\n\nThe divided Democratic resistance\n\nSince losing the White House, Democrats across Washington have struggled to coalesce behind a consistent message or messenger to stop Trump’s aggressive moves to slash the government workforce, weaken federal oversight and empower tech titan Elon Musk to execute his vision.\n\nThere has been no centralized movement to organize the anti-Trump resistance.\n\n“You look around — who else is doing it? No one,” Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., said of Sanders' efforts. “My hope is that the dam will break in terms of Democrats going on the offense ... We need to take the argument directly to the people.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a longtime Sanders ally, said she would join him on the road in the coming weeks. She’s also planning solo appearances in Republican-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York — and perhaps others in places where Republicans have declined to hold in-person town halls where they might face protests.\n\n“It’s not about whether Bernie should or shouldn’t be doing this. It’s about that we all should,” she said. “But he is unique in this country, and so long as we are blessed to have that capacity on our side, I think we should be thankful for it.”\n\nBeyond Sanders' tour, angry voters have so far relied on grassroots groups like Indivisible to organize a series of local protests. They have been effective in pressuring Trump’s allies in some cases. A number of House Republicans facing angry questions have criticized Musk or questioned the cuts being carried out at his allies' behest.\n\nIndivisible co-founder Ezra Levin, who has been critical of many Democratic leaders, praised Sanders for stepping up.\n\n“I wish more Democrats were traveling the country, including to red states, to rally the the majority against Musk and Project 2025,” Levin said. “Sure as hell beats (House Democratic leader Hakeem) Jeffries traveling the country for his children’s book tour during a constitutional crisis.”\n\nDuring last month’s congressional recess, Jeffries made two appearances to promote a children’s book about democracy. He has also traveled to support House Democrats. This past weekend, he was in Selma, Alabama, to mark the 60th anniversary of Bloody Sunday.\n\nThe truth is that few, if any, Democratic leaders have the capacity to draw such crowds on short notice or organize the related logistics on a national scale. The party’s nascent class of 2028 presidential prospects, a group that includes California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, have limited national profiles and they have been reluctant to step too far into the national spotlight so far.\n\nConnecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, among the more outspoken Trump critics in Congress, said that Democrats must be better organized.\n\n“People are desperate to be plugged into action right now. People see the threat. They are anxious and angry and motivated and they want to be sent in a direction to help,” he said.\n\nMurphy acknowledged that Sanders still has plenty of detractors within the Democratic Party who view him and his progressive policy ideas — replacing private and job-based health insurance with a government-funded “Medicare for All” plan, free public college, and the “Green New Deal” on climate policy — as too radical.\n\nIndeed, it was just five years ago when Democrats coalesced around Joe Biden to effectively block Sanders from winning the party’s 2020 presidential nomination.\n\n“There still are a lot of folks who view Bernie as a danger to the party,” Murphy said, “whereas I see his message as the core of what we need to build on.”\n\nSanders was a staunch supporter of Biden over the last four years but criticized the Democratic Party in the aftermath of Kamala Harris' loss last fall, declaring that Trump’s victory was possible only because Democrats had “abandoned” the working class.\n\nUnited Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who introduced Sanders in Michigan, said more Democrats need to “follow his lead to focus on working-class people and working-class issues.”\n\n“They’ve got to take a hard look in the mirror, in my opinion, and decide who the hell they want to represent,” Fain said of Democrats. “We’ve been clear as a union, if they aren’t looking out for working-class people, we’re not going to be there for them.”\n\nThe voters speak\n\nThe voters who packed venues across Wisconsin and Michigan over the weekend composed a diverse group, including some who did not support Sanders' past presidential campaigns. Most said that Democratic leaders have not done enough to stop Trump.\n\n“I’m here because I’m afraid for our country. The last six weeks have been horrible,” said Diana Schack, a 72-year-old retired lawyer who attended her first Sanders rally on Saturday. “I am becoming a more avid Bernie fan, especially in light of the work he’s doing traveling around the country. These are not normal times.”\n\nIn Kenosha the night before, Amber Schulz, a 50-year-old medical worker, demanded that her party “step up and do something.”\n\n“Bernie is the only politician I trust,” she said.\n\nTony Gonzales, 56, an independent from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said he’s worried that Trump will “dismantle historic American standards” and try to stay in office beyond this term. The Constitution bars presidents from serving more than two terms, even as Trump has suggested he deserves a third.\n\n“It’s a dangerous time right now,” Gonzales said. “What Bernie has to say — and the turnout — is important. His voice is still being heard.”\n\nSanders delivered the same fiery populist message over the weekend that he has for decades, seizing on the nation’s economic inequality to call for free health care, free public higher education and stronger social safety net programs. Sanders was especially focused on the team of billionaires Trump has appointed to serve as leaders in his administration, including Musk and a half dozen others.\n\n“They want to dismantle the federal government and cut programs that working people desperately need,” Sanders warned.\n\n“Yes, the oligarchs are enormously powerful. They have endless amounts of money. They control our economy. They own much of the media, and they have enormous influence over our political system,” he continued. “But from the bottom of my heart, I believe that if we stand together, we can beat them.”\n\nIt’s unclear how long that Sanders, an octogenarian who was hospitalized for a heart condition during his 2020 campaign, will continue in this role. A spokesperson said Sanders hasn’t had any health issues since the 2019 episode.\n\nHe is not expected to slow down anytime soon. Sanders is leaning on his 2020 presidential campaign manager, Faiz Shakir, to organize his stops, backed by a handful of former presidential campaign staffers working on a contract basis.\n\nShakir, who lost his bid to become the new chair of the Democratic National Committee, acknowledged strategic differences within the party about how best to combat Trump.\n\nLast month, veteran political strategist James Carville penned an opinion piece calling for Democrats to “roll over and play dead,” betting that Trump and his party would ultimately suffer a political backlash from voters for going too far.\n\n“One theory is you can play dead; you can strategically retreat,” Shakir said. “Or, you play alive, and you go out to people and you talk to them with conviction and integrity.”","summary":"For now, at least, Sanders stands alone as the only elected official willing — or perhaps able — to mount a national campaign to harness the fear and anger of the sprawling anti-Trump movement.","url":"https://www.mlive.com/news/2025/03/bernie-sanders-just-drew-a-huge-crowd-in-michigan-as-he-steps-in-to-lead-anti-trump-resistance.html","image":"https://www.mlive.com/resizer/v2/A3YHCT6CVVACXNMJ27NZM7QZ4I.jpg?auth=faf7b01817166d25480b0f21e8472fc2f7c7113baf45404044517f7283b12dd3&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-10 15:18:38","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.041}]}
