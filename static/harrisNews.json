When did you first notice that President Biden's mental faculties appeared diminished?\" Baier asked. After a brief pause to the question, Harris continued touting Biden's ability in office. \"Joe Biden, I have watched from the Oval Office to the Situation Room, and he has the judgment and the experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people,\" Harris said. KAMALA HARRIS REPEATEDLY PIVOTS TO TRUMP WHEN GRILLED ON IMMIGRATION RECORD IN FOX NEWS INTERVIEW \"There were no concerns raised?\" Baier followed. \"Bret, Joe Biden is not on the ballot… and Donald Trump is,\" Harris responded. The \"Special Report\" anchor then cited comments made by actor George Clooney, who said in the now-infamous New York Times op-ed that the president wasn't the same Joe Biden he once knew after spending time with him at a fundraiser earlier this year. HARRIS RIPPED FOR RESURFACED CLAIMS PRAISING BIDEN'S FITNESS AMID AGE CONCERNS: ‘COMPLICIT IN A COVERUP’ \"You met with him at least once a week for three-and-a-half years. You didn't have any concerns?\" Baier pressed. \"I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump,\" Harris responded. \"Which is why the people who know him best, including leaders of our national security community have all spoken out, even people who worked for him in the Oval Office, worked with him in the Situation Room and have said he is unfit and dangerous and should never be President of the United States again, including his former vice president, which is why the job was open for him to choose another running mate. So that is a fact.

Baier spent a majority of the interview interrupting and talking over Harris as she pushed back to finish her answers. The pair clashed on immigration, Donald Trump’s ongoing threats against those who oppose him, and her support of President Joe Biden.\n\n At point, Baier rolled a clip of Harris being asked on The View what she would have differently than Biden over the past three and a half years, and replying, “There is nothing that comes to mind — and I’ve been a part of most of the decisions that have had impact.”\n\n When addressing Baier on Wednesday, Harris said, “Let me be very clear: My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency.”\n\n “Like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas,” she continued. “I represent a new generation of leadership. For example, I am someone who has not spent the majority of my career in Washington, D.C. I invite ideas, whether it be from the Republicans who are supporting me, who were just on stage with me minutes ago, and the business sector and others who can contribute to the decisions that I make.”\n\n Earlier in the interview, Baier also asked Harris how many undocumented immigrants had crossed into the United States during Biden’s administration. After Harris acknowledged immigration was “a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have,” Baier cut in to claim it was 6 million people.\n\n “Let me just finish. I’ll get you a question I promise you to answer,” Harris shot back, adding that Biden’s first proposed piece of legislation after being sworn in was “a bill to fix our immigration system.” Although the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 was signed by Biden on his first day of office, Baier pointed out that the bill died despite Democrats controlling the House and Senate.\n\n “We recognized from day one that — on the point of this being your first question — it is a priority for us as a nation and for the American people, and our focus has been on fixing a problem,” Harris said, referencing the White House’s efforts to bolster resources at entry points at the border and increasing penalties for illegal crossings.\n\n Harris also called out Trump and his allies for blocking a bipartisan immigration bill in order to fuel the border crisis and boost Trump‘s campaign for the presidency. “[Trump] preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,” said the vice president. “In this election, this is rightfully a discussion that the American people want to have, and what they want are solutions. They want the President of the United States who is not playing political games with the issue.”","summary":"The vice president and Fox News' Bret Baier sparred for much of the interview.

[+] during the 2024 CFP National Championship game. Could the IRS rule that revenue from college sports should be taxed in the years ahead? (Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nWhen the Supreme Court reversed the 1984 Chevron ruling in June, the overwhelming majority of the folks in higher education I’ve talked to breathed a (quiet) sigh of relief, regardless of political orientation.\n\nThe original Chevron ruling, which gave regulatory agencies significant latitude in establishing regulations that Congress hadn’t directly addressed in legislation, has created a series of whiplash events for those leading colleges and universities over the past decade.\n\nWhy? Every time a new administration came into office, it seemed that many higher education regulations would change dramatically.\n\nAs anyone will tell you, managing in tremendous uncertainty where the context changes in significant and unpredictable ways every few years is a surefire way to freeze innovation and investment.\n\nSo while I expect the rulings in Relentless v. Department of Commerce and Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo that overturned Chevron will, over time, result in legal action that begins to stabilize some of this regulatory whiplash, I also wonder if it will have some surprising impacts.\n\nToday’s Higher Education Act bars incentive compensation—paying money—to employees or third parties in exchange for enrolling students. In 2011, however, the Education Department issued a Dear Colleague letter saying that the ban didn’t apply to third parties that provided a bundled set of services, which could include recruitment. That ruling has largely held the online program managers (OPM) industry together, as companies like 2U and more have been able to share in the revenues with online programs at colleges and universities.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPokémon’s Typhlosion Goes Viral After Game Freak Leak For The Weirdest Possible Reason\n\nWhat Time Is Kamala Harris’ Interview With Fox News Tonight?\n\nTrump Vs. Harris 2024 Polls: Trump Leads In Fox News Survey—Harris Up In 2 Others\n\nThat’s a letter that many have expected this current Department of Education to reverse. And that expected reversal is also an example of the whiplash many have hoped to move beyond.\n\nBut in a post-Chevron world, I wonder how the original 2011 Dear Colleague letter is even permissible in the first place. From the perspective of plain English, it seems to clearly override Congress’s policy as expressed in the Higher Education Act.\n\nI wish it were otherwise. To me, the Dear Colleague letter makes sense, as I’d prefer the Department of Education regulate outcomes rather than the arrangements by which colleges and universities deliver education. But I’m not sure how I see the Dear Colleague letter standing in a post-Chevron world.\n\nIf I’m wrong, I’d love to learn why.\n\nTaxing College Sports?\n\nIn the vein of continued speculation… As the changes around college athletics reach a fever pitch, with “athlete students,” as my Future U. co-host Jeff Selingo recently termed them, receiving large deals from NIL (name, image, likeness) Collectives to attend and compete for certain schools; an agreed-upon resolution between the NCAA and House allowing for athlete students to be paid directly by the schools; and employee status on the horizon, I wonder if the IRS might step in and force the issue of whether college sports teams remain, well, part of colleges.\n\nHow might the IRS get involved?\n\nAlthough tax-exempt entities (non-profits) don’t pay tax, they can pay tax on “unrelated business income.” The definition of unrelated business income is that which is “from a trade or business, regularly carried on, that is not substantially related to the charitable, educational, or other purpose that is the basis of the organization's exemption.”\n\nMy sense is that it’s harder and harder to claim that big-time, varsity sports are connected to a college’s educational purpose. Might the IRS declare the revenues from varsity athletics to be unrelated business income—and therefore taxable?\n\nIf that were to happen, I wonder whether colleges might spin some of their athletic teams out as related for-profit entities.\n\nMassachusetts Referendum On The MCAS Graduation Requirement\n\nSeveral stories suggest that Massachusetts voters are likely to end the requirement that students pass the MCAS (Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System) exams to graduate when they vote on Referendum 2 in November.\n\nEnding the requirement would be a mistake.\n\nAlthough there’s plenty of room for improvement in the MCAS English, science and math exams, having a third-party validate that someone has learned and mastered certain foundational skills and knowledge is a good thing. Teachers shouldn’t be the judge of their students’ performance. Not only does it create an incentive for grade inflation, but it also puts teachers in the uncomfortable position of being not just students’ coaches and advocates, but also their judges and juries. That’s unfair to teachers, students and parents.\n\nIn the absence of a robust set of publicly-funded educational choices for families, it’s a bad idea—and one that’s in search of a problem that doesn’t really exist.\n\nAccording to The74, “Ultimately, the vast majority of students — about 99% — meet the requirements.”\n\nIn other words, the exams largely serve as a floor, not a ceiling. And it’s as close to a mastery-, or competency-based, one as we have in this country. Students are allowed to take the exams multiple times—and there is even a provision for alternative ways of showing mastery.\n\nWhat’s more, because Massachusetts doesn’t have statewide high school course requirements, it gives students (and schools) the latitude to at least theoretically explore a variety of interests in multiple pathways—career and academic.\n\nMass. Gov. Maura Healey, Mass. Secretary of Education Patrick Tutwiler, the National Parents Union, the Democrats for Education Reform, the Boston Globe, and more are right to argue in its favor.\n\nAs The74 quoted the National Parents Union president and Mass. resident Keri Rodrigues, the parent of five children, one of whom receives special education services, “getting rid of the requirement in the name of kids with disabilities is ‘really offensive.’”\n\nIt would be another sad step in the name of equity that would be anything but equitable.\n\nMassachusetts may have led the way in education for a long time, but its star has been increasingly fading.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

That’s a reversal from last month when Harris had a narrow advantage.\n\nHarris, however, is ahead by 6 points among voters from the seven key battleground states and the candidates tie 49% each among voters in close counties (where the Joe Biden-Trump 2020 margin was less than 10 points). Trump’s advantage comes from a larger share in counties he won by more than 10 points in 2020 (64-35%) than Harris has in counties Biden won by more than 10 points (58-39%).\n\nThat raises the question of whether the Democrat could win the Electoral College while losing the national popular vote. In 2000 and 2016, it was the GOP candidate who lost the popular vote but won the Electoral College.\n\nTrump’s 2-point edge among likely voters falls well within the margin of error. The results are identical among the larger group of registered voters. Last month, Harris was up by 2 points (50-48%) among both likely and registered voters. \n\nThis analysis uses registered voter results for apples-to-apples trend comparisons.\n\nThese are Trump’s best numbers since Harris became the nominee in August. The movement toward him mainly comes from an increase in support among White voters, who now favor him by 10 points, up from 4 points last month and 6 points in August. He is also at record highs among voters 65 and over (49%) and those with a college degree (48%). \n\nAt the same time, Harris receives her lowest support since becoming the nominee among Black voters (67%), college graduates (49%), voters 65 and over (47%), and Whites with a college degree (46%). \n\nYet on the surface, the race has stayed within a small range. In August, Trump was ahead by 1 point, then Harris was up by 2 points in September, and now Trump has a 2-point edge. \n\n“Overall, the movement toward Trump is subtle but potentially consequential, especially if he is making gains among college-educated voters,” says Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducts Fox News surveys with Republican Daron Shaw. “However, the race has been well within the margin of error for three months and the outcome will likely hinge on which side is more effective at getting their voters to the polls as opposed to persuasion.” \n\nThe 20-point gender gap remains, as men back Trump and women go for Harris.\n\nThe good news for Harris is she gets 52% of new voters (those who haven’t voted in the last two presidential elections) and 20% non-MAGA Republicans.\n\nShe is also maintaining her double-digit lead over Trump among independents. That keeps the contest close, as each candidate receives backing from over 9 in 10 of their respective partisans. On the other hand, more voters nationally identify as Republican than Democrat, and that is what gives Trump the edge in this race.\n\nWhile the vice president gets majority support among Hispanics (52%) and voters under age 30 (54%), both numbers trail President Joe Biden’s support in 2020 according to the Fox News Voter Analysis election survey (6 in 10 from each group). \n\nFor Trump, the good news is that he improved on every issue and character trait since September. And a majority remembers his time in office positively: 53% approve of the job he did as president. That is 4 points higher than he ever received while in office. Fully 93% of Republicans approve as do 74% of non-MAGA Republicans and 45% of independents.\n\nBy comparison, currently only 40% of voters approve of Biden’s job performance, which matches previous lows in November 2023 and July 2022. \n\nOnly slightly more, 43%, approve of the government’s response to recent hurricanes, with most Democrats approving and most Republicans and independents disapproving.\n\nThe economy continues to outrank all other issues, as 40% say it is the most important issue in deciding their choice for president. Less than half as many prioritize immigration and abortion, and far fewer cite issues such as election integrity, health care, climate change, guns, crime, and foreign policy.\n\nSeven in 10 view the economy negatively. The 30% who rate conditions positively is up from a low of 17% in 2022, and close to the 33% who felt good about the economy at the end of Trump’s term. Half of Democrats give positive ratings while majorities of Republicans and independents rate economic conditions negatively.\n\nOverall, 44% say they are falling behind financially, which is worse by 17 points compared to three years ago when only 27% felt that way. Some 13% feel they are getting ahead financially, while 43% are holding steady. \n\nTrump is seen as better than Harris at handling the economy (by 8 points). He also bests her on immigration (+15), crime (+8), and guns (+6). With the expanding conflict in the Middle East, it is noteworthy Trump is favored by 13 points on Israel and the war, up from a 7-point lead in September. He has improved his standing on every issue compared to September, mostly by small margins.\n\nMore voters trust Harris to handle abortion (by 14 points), climate change (+12), and health care (+8). The two candidates are rated about evenly on taxes (Trump +4), Supreme Court nominations (Trump +1), and election integrity (Harris +3). \n\n“Sometimes, elections are simple,” says Shaw. “In three weeks, we may be wondering how we thought the sitting vice president would win when only two in five voters think the incumbent administration has done a good job and only one in seven say they are getting ahead financially.”\n\nDemocrats and Republicans prioritize the issues differently, with the widest gap (28 points) on immigration. There’s an 18-point gap on abortion and 15 points on the economy.\n\nSome 12% of Democrats see Trump as better at handling the economy and 18% feel that way about immigration, while 17% of Republicans trust Harris more on abortion and climate change.\n\nTrump is helped by more voters saying they know a great deal about where he stands on their priority issues than they do about Harris (57% vs. 44%). Fully 78% of Republicans feel they know a great deal about Trump’s stances while 65% of Democrats say the same about Harris.\n\nLess than half believe Trump (43%) and Harris (48%) are honest and trustworthy, though Trump’s number is a personal best. Voters are also more likely to see him as a strong leader (55% vs. 47% for Harris) and “up to the job” of president (53% vs. 50%). Harris has an edge on having the mental soundness to be president (54% vs. 52% for Trump), but here again Trump is at a personal best. \n\nHarris has lost ground on some key characteristics. She was seen as better at helping the middle class by 9 points in September and that has declined to 4 points now. Her 5-point edge on “fighting for people like you” is now 2 points, and her 6-point advantage on “protecting personal rights and freedoms” has disappeared as the candidates are tied. \n\nVoters also narrowly see Trump as the one bringing needed change and protecting free speech, both traits where Harris was favored last month. \n\nThe race continues to be more about Trump than Harris, as most of his backers say their vote is for him rather than against Harris. Among Harris supporters, two-thirds describe their vote as for her, but one-third say it is against Trump. For comparison, in May, nearly half of Biden supporters said their vote was mainly against Trump. Among Trump supporters, 80% say they are voting for him rather than against Harris (18%).\n\nWhen saying in their own words what one issue or factor was motivating them to get out and vote this year, the top response from Harris supporters is dislike of the other candidate, followed by protecting democracy, and abortion. For those backing Trump, the economy and immigration are the top two motivators, followed by candidate characteristics. Among men, it’s dislike of the other candidate, the economy, and traits (in that order), while for women the economy and abortion tie as the top motivator, followed by candidate traits. \n\nPoll-Pourri\n\nAs red and blue states become shades of purple it is tough to know what level of a popular vote suggests a win in the Electoral College. In 2016, Hillary Clinton got more votes nationally by a 2-point margin but lost the Electoral College (by 77 electoral votes), while Joe Biden had a 4-point advantage in the popular vote and won the Electoral College (by 74). \n\nAbout one-third of voters overall and one-third of women say Harris becoming the first female president matters to their vote. Among the 17% saying it matters a great deal, 80% back Harris.\n\nAbout 3 in 10 voters say they check news multiple times a day and they favor Trump by 10 points. At the other end of the spectrum, 1 in 10 say they don’t pay attention to news, and these disengaged voters favor Trump by 16 points. The 57% who follow news regularly but not constantly back Harris by 6 points.\n\nMost of each candidate’s backers feel certain of their vote, and two-thirds of both Harris’ and Trump’s supporters say they are “extremely” motivated to vote. \n\nConducted October 11-14, 2024 under the direction of Beacon Research (D) and Shaw & Company Research (R), this Fox News survey includes interviews with a sample of 1,110 registered voters randomly selected from a national voter file. Respondents spoke with live interviewers on landlines (129) and cellphones (719) or completed the survey online after receiving a text (262). Results based on both the full registered voter sample and the subsample of 870 likely voters have a margin of sampling error of ±3 percentage points. Sampling error associated with results among subgroup is higher. In addition to sampling error, question wording and order can influence results. Weights are generally applied to age, race, education, and area variables to ensure the demographics of respondents are representative of the registered voter population. Sources for developing weight targets include the American Community Survey, Fox News Voter Analysis, and voter file data. Likely voters are based on a probabilistic statistical model that relies on past vote history, interest in the current election, age, education, race, ethnicity, church attendance, and marital status.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump is ahead of Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential contest, 50-48% according to a new Fox News national survey.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/donald-trump-ahead-of-kamala-harris-by-2-points-nationally-swing-from-just-a-month-ago-fox-news-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-iu42j6d9v-1729120201827.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1729105879&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6kp5yesf-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-17 00:20:15","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.138},{"id":259982036,"title":"Harris distances herself from Biden, bashes Trump in tense Fox News interview","text":"Kamala Harris on Wednesday distanced herself from President Joe Biden and bashed her Republican presidential rival Donald Trump in a heated interview with Fox News anchor Brett Baier.\n\n“Let me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency,” Harris said on the conservative news network, after Baier pressed her on whether the vice president would do anything differently than the incumbent.\n\n“And like every new president that comes in to office, I will bring my life experiences, my professional experiences, and fresh and new ideas,” the Democratic nominee said.\n\nThe 26-minute interview was focused heavily on the issue of immigration, and Harris again blamed Trump for killing a bipartisan bill aimed at addressing the crisis at the southern border.\n\nThe interview was tense from the first exchange, when Baier repeatedly interrupted Harris’ opening answer about immigration. “You have to let me finish please … I’m in the middle of responding to the point you’re raising, and I’d like to finish,” Harris said early on.","summary":"Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris arrives for a campaign event at the Dort Financial Center in Flint, Michigan, October 4, 2024.  Geoff Robins &#124; Afp &#124; Getty Images Kamala Harris on Wednesday distanced herself from President Joe Biden and bashed her Republican presidential rival Donald Trump in a heated interview with Fox &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Harris distances herself from Biden, bashes Trump in tense Fox News interview appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/us-news/harris-distances-herself-from-biden-bashes-trump-in-tense-fox-news-interview/","image":"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/108043823-1728221671355-gettyimages-2175885786-AFP_36JA973.jpeg?v=1729121241&w=1920&h=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-17 00:17:27","author":"Evelyn Blackwell","authors":["Evelyn Blackwell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":259981974,"title":"Lithuanian Star Survey Could Offer Shortcut To Finding Exo-Earths","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nThe author in the dome of the 1.65 meter telescope at Lithuania's Moletai Astronomical Observatory.\nBruce Dorminey\n\nThe old adage that we are stardust is literally true. But is there a link between a star’s given chemical composition and the types of planets it may form?\n\nFor almost a decade now, a dedicated team of Lithuanian astronomers has been trying to answer this conundrum using a state-of-the-art spectrograph at a telescope some 70 km outside Vilnius.\n\nThe Vilnius University astronomers have been taking spectra (measurements of wavelengths of light) from thousands of solar type stars on every clear night since 2016. A prime goal is to take the chemical fingerprints of these bright F, G, and K spectral type stars to determine whether there are possible links between the chemical makeup of these stars and the planets that they may harbor.\n\nWe find overabundances of some stellar chemical elements and those planet-hosting stars, Vilnius University astrophysicist Gražina Tautvaišienė, the survey’s lead and head of the Moletai Astronomical Observatory, told me in her office. If we can do this successfully, the goal will be to find a shortcut to detecting rocky planets, Tautvaišienė, who has just been elected as Vice President of the International Astronomical Union, says.\n\nThe team has already garnered the spectra of some 1500 bright solar type stars using the high-resolution Vilnius University Echelle Spectrograph. About the size of a compact car, VUES sits alone in a climate-controlled room on a floor below the main dome of the Moletai Observatory’s 1.65-meter optical telescope.\n\nOn clear nights, the observatory —- which sits in a clearing surrounded by a beautifully isolated forest of spruce, birch and pine —- has dark enough skies to take spectra of hundreds of bright stars visible from this northern latitude.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPokémon’s Typhlosion Goes Viral After Game Freak Leak For The Weirdest Possible Reason\n\nWhat Time Is Kamala Harris’ Interview With Fox News Tonight?\n\nTrump Vs. Harris 2024 Polls: Trump Leads In Fox News Survey—Harris Up In 2 Others\n\nOf the stars thus far observed out to distances of up to 3000 light years, their age ranges from about 200 million years old to an upper limit of about 12 billion years old. Although only a third of the nights here are clear, the survey operates year-round and typically produces spectra from some 200 stars per year.\n\nBased on stellar chemical composition, we want to be able to predict which stars have a higher chance of having rocky planets, Arnas Drazdauskas, an observational astronomer at Vilnius University, told me at the telescope.\n\nThe team recently found that about 83 percent of a sample of 300 stars had magnesium to silicon values in the range between 1.0 and 2.0.\n\nThis could suggest that they may have terrestrial type planets with a composition close to that of our planet earth, says Tautvaišienė.\n\nBut the team’s work goes well beyond determining a star’s mere chemical makeup and includes parameters such as its stellar temperature, its gravity, and its metallicity (how many heavy elements it may have).\n\nWe then take a deeper look at what's inside the star, namely, the abundance of up to 32 chemical elements, Drazdauskas says. We start with the elements important for life, such as carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, magnesium, and silicon; then we go on up to barium and even the rare earth metal yttrium, he says.\n\nA Matter Of Chemistry\n\nOne question is whether there is any sort of a minimum chemical stellar requirement for any planet to form, says Drazdauskas. So, we are looking to see if there is a difference in the chemistry of stars that harbor different types of planets —- long period, short period, Jupiter size, Earth size, etc., he says.\n\nMassive icy planets tend to form around more metal-rich stars. Yet rocky planets are found around stars with a broad range of metallicities.\n\nDrazdauskas with the VUES spectrograph.\nBruce Dorminey\n\nWe know of only about 10,000 stars that have been spectroscopically measured with the precision that this telescope offers, Drazdauskas says. We need a much bigger sample and more theoretical studies to say with confidence that the chemical composition of a given star allows for the formation of what types of planets, he says.\n\nA Work In Progress\n\nGiven the fact that our own Galaxy has an estimated 20 billion sunlike stars, there’s loads of stellar spectroscopy to do.\n\nThe largest telescopes usually don’t do surveys; they concentrate on specific targets, leaving the surveying work for smaller telescopes which limits how much we can observe, says Drazdauskas.\n\nEven so, in principle, current technology is enough to allow astronomers to take spectra from billions of solar type stars.\n\nThe sample of exoplanetary hosts with detailed chemical composition still remains small, however.\n\nThe number of stars with confirmed earth or super-earth-sized planets and detailed chemical composition is even smaller, says Drazdauskas.\n\nThe Bottom Line?\n\nWe are not yet at the point where we can say with confidence that the chemical abundances of certain elements influence rocky planet formation, but the research looks promising, says Drazdauskas.\n\nAnd it’s still heartening that a relatively small optical telescope in a former Soviet Republic is taking part in this process while playing a vital role in our quest to understand our place in the cosmos.\n\nAs for the survey’s timeframe?\n\nThis survey will continue until we don't have people to work on it, or until the telescope breaks, says Drazdauskas.\n\nMoletai Astronomical Observatory in Lithuania\nBruce Dorminey\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

JD Vance, seized on the allegations to needle Harris.\n\n“Hi, I’m JD Vance. I wrote my own book, unlike Kamala Harris, who copied hers from Wikipedia,” he wrote on X. Vance’s 2016 memoir, Hillbilly Elegy recounts his blue-collar upbringing in Kentucky and Ohio.\n\nThe allegation involving King centers on a story Harris said her mother told her about a time when she was fussing as a toddler. Her mother, according to the book, asked her what was wrong and what she wanted. “I wailed back, ‘Fweedom,’” Harris wrote. Weber said Harris appropriated the anecdote, without attribution, from an interview King gave in 1965.\n\nBut other plagiarism experts questioned the severity of the claims. Jonathan Bailey, a consultant and publisher of the website Plagiarism Today, said in a Tuesday post that the King story allegation first arose in early 2021 and couldn’t be proven based on available evidence. But several other plagiarism accusations are more troublesome, he said, including Weber’s allegation that Harris’ book copied and pasted, without citation, a section of a Wikipedia article.\n\nBut the patterns in the book point to “sloppy writing habits, not a malicious intent to defraud,” he said.\n\n“Though some of the passages, such as the Wikipedia one, are sloppy to the point of negligence, when you look at the portion of the book involved, the nature of the issues, and the citations provided, negligence remains more likely than malice in my eyes,” Bailey wrote.\n\nMiguel Roig, a psychology professor at St. John’s University in New York who studies plagiarism in the sciences, said the lapses described by Weber meet the definition of plagiarism. But, he added, context is important. The problematic passages amount to a small total of the overall book and “hardly seems like an attempt to defraud,” he said.\n\n“Any time minor issues like these occur, the offending authors should simply acknowledge the obvious errors, apologize, and make corrections where feasible, and just move on,” Roig said.\n\nHarris wrote “Smart on Crime” when she was the district attorney for San Francisco. The book spelled out her ideas for improving public safety and making the criminal justice system more effective. In 2010, a year after the book was published, she was elected attorney general of California.\n\nHarris’ co-author, Joan O’C. Hamilton, works as a book collaborator and ghostwriter, according to her website.\n\nWeber, the plagiarism researcher in Austria, said in an email that much of the work to check Harris’s book was done by an associate whom he did not identify. But he said the associate was “driven by personal choice and interest, not by political motivations.” This was Weber’s first “international case,” he said.\n\nHe also said he was unaware until the Harris review had been released that Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, had published books.\n\n“Every scientist can feel free to check the books of Donald Trump or whomsoever as we did it with Kamala Harris,” Weber said.\n\nDebora Weber-Wulff, a professor of media and computing at Berlin University of Applied Sciences in Germany and no relation to Weber, sided with Bailey’s assessment and said the book’s publisher would have to decide whether any problems justify removing it from sales. Any legal action is unlikely because the original author of the plagiarized content would have to pursue a potentially costly lawsuit.\n\n“No one in their right mind would invite a suit like this,” Weber-Wulff said. “Only the lawyers profit.”","summary":"WASHINGTON – Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris&#8217; campaign is dismissing accusations that&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/harris-campaign-defends-against-plagiarism-accusations-expert-suggests-claims-are-valid/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Harris-campaign-calls-plagiarism-claims-a-partisan-700x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-17 00:09:19","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.459},{"id":259981658,"title":"Georgia judge blocks rule for hand counting ballots","text":"A Georgia judge has blocked a new rule requiring ballots submitted on election day to be counted by hand after polls close, marking a victory for Democrats and voting rights groups concerned about potential disruptions to the US presidential election.\n\nFulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney issued his decision just a day after he ruled that county election officials must certify election results by the legal deadline, preventing any refusal to certify based on unfounded concerns of fraud. \n\nThe hand-count rule, introduced by the State Election Board, was intended to mandate that three poll workers manually count ballots after voting ended. \n\nHowever, McBurney ruled that the measure was introduced too late and lacked sufficient guidelines, training, or budget provisions, creating the risk of “administrative chaos” in an election just weeks away. \n\nThe rulings have been hailed by Democratic groups and the Harris campaign as crucial to ensuring the election runs smoothly and on time, especially as early in-person voting began in the state. \n\nThey argue that the hand-count rule was designed to delay election results and undermine confidence in the outcome, especially if former President Donald Trump were to lose to Vice President Kamala Harris in the upcoming presidential election. \n\nMcBurney’s rulings follow concerns that Trump-endorsed State Election Board rules could be used to block or delay certification, echoing the former president’s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results. \n\nThe judge emphasised that nothing in Georgia law permits county election officials to refuse certification or decide whether fraud has occurred, with their role limited to sharing concerns with the appropriate authorities.\n\nThe decision comes amidst a wave of lawsuits over new election rules passed by the State Election Board since August, further complicating the run-up to next month’s presidential election.\n\nGeorgia was one of the Trump campaign’s top targets for spurious lawsuits and false claims of widespread fraud after the former president lost it to Joe Biden in 2020, but their efforts came to nothing.\n\nTrump himself is facing a criminal indictment in the state over his efforts to pressure state officials to “find” enough votes to flip the state his way.","summary":"The ruling ensures election results will be certified on time, marking a victory for Democrats and voting rights groups who feared delays could undermine the election process.

Another identical suite in the same government building is dark and idle.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are running markedly different transition efforts to be ready for the potential responsibility of taking over the federal government. It’s a below-the-radar effort for now that will snap into sharp focus as soon as a winner is declared.\n\nBut already, their approaches speak to their divergent thinking about governing.\n\nHARRIS’ TRANSITION EFFORT IS GOING BY THE BOOK\n\nHarris’ team is being led by the former U.S. ambassador to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Yohannes Abraham served as executive director of the Biden-Harris transition in 2020 and is running a meticulous operation.\n\nThe team reached an agreement with the Biden administration to use government office space and other resources and to begin vetting potential key national security hires. As a precondition, the team released an ethics plan and promised to cap donations at $5,000 and release a list of donors.\n\nTrump, by contrast, has assembled a team of friends and family that includes former Democratic presidential candidates Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Tulsi Gabbard, as well as his adult sons, Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, and his running mate, JD Vance. It is being co-chaired by Cantor Fitzgerald CEO Howard Lutnick and Linda McMahon, the former wrestling executive who formerly led Trump’s Small Business Administration.\n\nTrump has thus far eschewed federal support for his transition team. His aides have yet to reach the required agreements with the General Services Administration, which manages federal property, and the White House on federal office space, technology support and security clearance procedures.\n\nWhile aides say they expect an agreement soon, others suspect it may only come after Election Day if Trump is victorious. Part of the holdup, according to a person familiar with the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private deliberations, stems from the congressionally mandated ethics requirements and private contribution limits set by the Presidential Transition Act.\n\nThat act, which is meant to ensure that all major party nominees are ready to assume the presidency on Inauguration Day, calls on the GSA to secure an agreement with eligible candidates by Sept. 1 and for the White House to reach one by Oct. 1. Both dates have long passed.\n\nTrump reached similar agreements with the Obama administration in 2016 during his first White House run, but the law was modified after the 2020 election to put limits on private contributions to the transition effort and to tighten ethics rules.\n\nA Biden administration official said the White House “is actively working with the Trump transition team” to complete an agreement.\n\nTRUMP’S TRANSITION TEAM IS CHARTING ITS OWN COURSE\n\nEven if Trump isn’t following the government’s proposed roadmap, his transition work is moving forward. Their primary focus so far has been on personnel.\n\nA number of allied outside groups, including the America First Policy Institute, where McMahon serves as chair of the board, have spent years assembling policy guides, model executive orders and legislation aimed at giving future Republican administrations a head start.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation has also assembled extensive policy plans and a personnel database under its “Project 2025\" banner, but Trump has distanced himself from and criticized the effort as Democrats have seized on its more extreme proposals.\n\nTrump and his campaign are particularly distrustful of the current administration, accusing them of launching investigations and indictments in order to hobble his election chances.\n\nFollowing a pair of assassination attempts, Trump has accused President Biden of failing to provide him with sufficient Secret Service resources, forcing his campaign to reschedule and cancel rallies. Aides have also accused the administration of reacting too passively to ongoing threats against Trump from Iran.\n\nTrump’s transition co-chairs said in a statement that they expect to sign all the recommended memos of understanding soon.\n\nIn a statement, Lutnick and McMahon said that Trump-Vance transition attorneys “continue to constructively engage” with the Biden administration toward the required agreements, which they expect to sign. They said “any suggestion to the contrary is false and intentionally misleading.”\n\nThey also said all transition staff are required to sign their own ethics pledge.\n\nDELAYS COULD MAKE IT HARDER TO CONFIRM KEP PERSONNEL FOR TRUMP\n\nThe foot-dragging by Trump’s team has ramifications not only for the peaceful transfer of power but also potentially for national security.\n\nOnly after the agreements are in place can the transition team send the FBI the names of potential appointees so that the agency can begin the time-consuming process of vetting them for top-secret security clearances before Election Day.\n\nHarris’ team is well on its way to lining up agency review teams – teams of ex-government officials and policy experts who would do top-to-bottom assessments of federal agencies to determine how to align their activities with Harris’ agenda.\n\nIf she wins, Harris will run the first same-party presidential transition since 1989, when George H.W. Bush took over from Ronald Reagan.\n\nCustomarily, all the political appointees in the departing administration will be expected to offer their resignations so Harris can choose whom to retain and replace. The ability to retain officials could be an asset, especially if Republicans take control of the Senate. Keeping some officials who were already confirmed under Biden could limit messy personnel fights on Capitol Hill.\n\nTrump’s decision to delay participating in the federally supported transition program exposes his team and national security to risk, said Max Stier, CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, which offers nonpartisan advice on transition best practices.\n\nBy foregoing federal support now, Stier predicted, Trump as president-elect would have a more difficult time bringing staff on board and scaling up the massive enterprise needed to steer the government in a new direction.\n\nBecause of the delay, Trump is also missing out on top-of-the-line government cybersecurity support at a time when his campaign has already been the victim of a cyberattack by Iran.\n\nThe end result “is who’s going to be actually ready to keep us safe and run our government effectively,” Stier said.\n\nBOTH TRANSITION TEAMS ARE KEEPING THEIR HEADS DOWN FOR NOW\n\nFor all the differences between the Trump and Harris efforts, there are some common strategies: Neither team plans to make personnel decisions before Nov. 5. And both teams are lying low so as not to tempt fate or distract from their candidates ahead of Election Day.\n\n“There is no transition without a successful campaign, and that’s where the focus is,” a Harris transition spokesperson said on the condition of anonymity to discuss the matter. “Consistent with precedent and responsible best practice, the transition is laying the foundation to be ready.”\n\nLutnick, one of Trump’s transition co-chairs, told the Associated Press that he has been pulling together lists of candidates for Trump to consider. He said he doesn’t talk about the process with the notoriously superstitious former president.\n\n“What I do is paint. I consider myself a mosaic painter,” Lutnick said. “I go and find the greatest candidates for the role.” He said his goal is to find about “eight amazing candidates” who can win Senate confirmation for each job opening that he can later bring to Trump.\n\nHe said he’s following the model he used in rebuilding Cantor Fitzgerald after 9/11, when the investment banking company lost 658 employees, including top talent, in the attack on the World Trade Center. He said he learned from that experience that the best way to hire the best people was through word of mouth.\n\n“You go to world-class people who you know and say, ‘Help me. Send me people that you vouch for,’” he said.\n\nLutnik said this year’s operation is “about as different as possible” from the 2016 effort that was first led by former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. After he won, Trump fired Christie, tossed out his plans and gave the job to Vice President-elect Mike Pence.\n\nIn an interview with The Financial Times, Lutnick said he would steer clear of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 transition work.\n\n“Project 2025 is an absolute zero for the Trump-Vance transition,” the billionaire told the paper. “You can use another term – radioactive.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr., who has not been involved in the team’s day-to-day work but is expected to step up his involvement after the election, has said he views his primary role as vetoing those who are not deemed loyal to his father’s agenda.","summary":"The vice president and former president are running markedly different transition efforts to be ready for the potential responsibility of taking over the federal government.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/10/16/harris-and-trump-transition-efforts-reflect-different-approaches-to-governing/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/10/APTOPIX_Election_2024_Harris_33613.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-17 00:07:04","author":"Zeke Miller And Jill Colvin,ZEKE MILLER and JILL COLVIN - Associated Press","authors":["Zeke Miller And Jill Colvin","ZEKE MILLER and JILL COLVIN - Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":259981586,"title":"Kamala Harris’ Fox News Interview Opens With Testy Exchange and Interruptions From Host","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris opened her first interview on Fox News with a heated exchange with host Bret Baier on Wednesday evening, as he repeatedly interrupted her answer to his question regarding the Biden administration’s handling of what he called “illegal” migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\n “How many illegal immigrants would you estimate your administration has released into the country over the last three and a half years?” the Special Report with Bret Baier host asked the vice president at the top of the one-on-one interview.\n\n Harris thanked him for the question because, she said, it’s an important matter for a number of voters. She then told Baier, “You know what I’m going to talk about” before she was interrupted by the host, who demanded an estimate from the presidential candidate. \n\n “But do you — just — a number. Do you think it’s 1 million? 3 million?” he asked.\n\n “Brett, let’s just get to the point,” Harris responded.\n\n The two continued to spar as Harris attempted to answer the question, which is a top issue for many in this election cycle, but the Fox News host refused to allow her to speak. \n\n “You have to let me finish,” she said at one point, evoking her famous shut-down of Mike Pence’s interruptions during the 2020 vice presidential debate when she told him, “I’m speaking.”\n\n Later, Harris was asked a question that very few Americans likely care about this election cycle when he questioned if she supports “using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender.” She answered in the affirmative on the matter when filling out a questionnaire as a senator and has become a talking point of conservatives as Harris comes within reach of the presidency. \n\n “I will follow the law, and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed, you’re probably familiar with it now,” Harris said. “It’s a public report that under Donald Trump’s administration, these surgeries were available on a medical necessity basis to people in the federal prison system.”\n\n As the interview closed, Harris touched on her rival’s harsh statements about and insults toward U.S. military personnel and commented on the one-sided nature of the interview with the Fox host.\n\n “I would like that we would have a conversation that is grounded in a full assessment of the facts,” Harris told Baier. “This interview is supposed to be about the choices that your viewers should be presented about this election, and the contrast is important.”\n\n It was questioned why Harris would bother with a sit-down interview at Fox News, whose bias toward the GOP and blatant distortion of facts has become notorious and gotten them nearly sued into oblivion.

Fulton County Superior Court Judge Thomas A. Cox ruled the new provisions \"illegal, unconstitutional and void\" in an opinion released Wednesday evening, according to multiple outlets. It comes hours after he weighed two lawsuits on the rules – one led by the Georgia Democratic Party, and a second by civil rights groups which also included current and former GOP state officials. One of the measures – a requirement for all ballots to be hand counted by three county election officials after they had been machine tabulated to ensure the totals match – has become a political lightening rod in recent weeks. GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE That rule was temporarily blocked in a separate ruling made Tuesday night challenging the SEB’s new measures. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney did not take issue with the rule’s intent but argued it would be untenable to implement at this late stage. Cox’s ruling invalidates that measure, while also invalidating a rule directing county officials to conduct a \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying election results, and giving them the ability \"to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.\" TRUMP VS HARRIS ROUND 2? VOTERS IN KEY GA COUNTY REVEAL IF THEY WANT SECOND DEBATE Cox also blocked new signature and photo ID requirements for people dropping off absentee ballots for others. The rules were passed last month in a 3-2 vote by the Republican majority on the elections board. Democrats had accused the GOP officials of trying to sow doubt and chaos in the elections process, while supporters of the rule changes said they were necessary guardrails to ensure voter confidence. In the wider-ranging of the two cases on Wednesday, led by Eternal Vigilance Action, a group founded by former GOP state legislator Scot Turner, the plaintiffs argued the SEB was out of its scope of authority in levying the new rules. \"Three members of the state election board, kind of like Napoleon, they put a crown on their head and say, ‘We are the emperors of election,’\" the plaintiffs’ lawyer said. \"No, that is not the way our system of government works.\" GEORGIA DEMS CHAIR REVEALS MESSAGE TO UNDECIDED GOP VOTERS AS HARRIS WORKS TO BUILD BROAD BASE But the defendants and supporting groups, including attorneys for the Georgia Republican Party, argued the state’s General Assembly gave the SEB the scope to craft such rules. \"They don't say which one of those statutes should be found unconstitutional because, remember, to rule in favor of the plaintiffs here, you're going to have to find that the General Assembly's grant of authority to the agency was unconstitutional,\" said a lawyer for the GOP. \"They don't say which one of the three powers we have that they violated, could be all three of them, could be one of the three. And if it's a constitutional challenge, you can't have something that's that vague to bring into a court to ask you to declare it to be unconstitutional.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaigns have dedicated significant time and resources to Georgia, which President Biden won by less than 1% in 2020.

Trump made several remarks about the situation, but based on his comments, it was surprising to see that he didn’t seem particularly concerned about the fainting attendees. Later in the event, Trump also paused the Q&A session and shifted the atmosphere by playing music.\n\nAs the first person received medical attention, Trump took a moment to thank both the early-arriving rally-goers and the doctors on hand. However, after the second person fainted, Trump paused his speech and said, \"Personally I enjoy this, you know. We lose weight. We can do this, lose four or five pounds, it's OK with me.\" Noem added to this, \"Kamala Harris isn't doing this.\" Trump laughed at Kristi Noem's joke about the building not having an air conditioner, agreeing that in today’s economy, it wouldn't be affordable. As reported by Newsweek, Trump then questioned, \"Would anybody else like to faint? Please raise your hand.\"\n\nTrump later requested to open the doors of the hall to let in some air but was informed that it wasn't possible due to security concerns. He then informed everyone present that both the people receiving treatment were doing fine. However, rather than going back to the Q&A session, Trump transformed the event into an unplanned musical concert. He began with one of his favorite songs, Luciano Pavarotti's Ave Maria. For the next 40 minutes, the former president swayed to the music on stage while some attendees began to leave early, as reported by The Independent.\n\nAccording to a Trump representative, the former president turned the town hall event into a musical concert to lighten everyone's mood and make them feel more joyful. Another Trump spokesman, Steven Cheung, commented on Twitter, attributing the fainting to the audience's sheer excitement. At the Pennsylvania town hall, he described the scene as a \"total lovefest\". Similar opinions regarding the incident were later expressed by Trump on his Truth Social platform. He wrote, \"We started playing music while we waited, and just kept it going. So different, but it ended up being a GREAT EVENING!\"\n\nMeanwhile, Kamala HQ, the rapid-response team for Harris's campaign, didn’t hold back on their critique. They claimed that Trump was looking lost, confused, and frozen on stage. Democrat Eric Swalwell, D-Calif., also shared his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter). He termed the situation \"sad\" for the former president and offered his sympathies. He continued by saying that Trump appeared to be \"brain dead\" and he urged his family to intervene and get him some assistance. Trump's aides, however, presented a different image. They maintained that his move had delighted the crowd in the swing state. According to USA Today, they said that Harris and the Democrats were taking cheap shots as they were afraid of losing.","summary":"“It ended up being a GREAT EVENING,” Donald Trump wrote about his Monday’s town hall in Oaks, Pennsylvania.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trump-didnt-seem-to-care-much-about-fainting-audience-members-its-ok-we-lose-weight","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/720305/uploads/0c50f2b0-8b79-11ef-8336-d7d9a2f090cd_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-17 00:00:00","author":"INQUISITR,Simran Kumari","authors":["INQUISITR","Simran Kumari"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.044},{"id":259981042,"title":"The Cleveland Guardians Had So Many Chances To Win Game 2 Of The ALCS","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nCleveland shortstop Brayan Rocchio couldn't catch Aaron Judge's pop-out, allowing an unearned run to ...

After falling to the Yankees 5-2 in Game 1, the Guardians faced the arduous task of trying to beat ace Gerrit Cole in a seemingly must-win game.\n\nAfter going 1-2-3 in the top of the first inning, the Guardians gave up hits to the first two Yankees in the bottom half, putting runners on the corners with no outs, and Aaron Judge coming to the plate. Tanner Bibee induced Judge to pop to short, but Brayan Rocchio dropped the ball, allowing an unearned run to score. Cleveland was able to escape the inning before any further damage was done.\n\nJosh Naylor led off Cleveland’s half of the second with a single to right, only to be stranded three batters later. This would become a theme.\n\nThe Yankees scored two runs in the bottom of the second to push their lead to 3-0.\n\nA single and a walk brought Guardians all-world third baseman José Ramírez to the plate as the tying run in the third. He then hit a lazy flyball to center to end the inning, leaving two more runners.\n\nIn the fourth, Cleveland loaded the bases with one out. Manager Stephen Vogt elected to pinch hit David Fry for catcher Bo Naylor with the tying runs on base. One pitch later, Fry had popped out to third. Rocchio battled Cole, only to strike out looking on the ninth pitch of the at-bat.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nPokémon’s Typhlosion Goes Viral After Game Freak Leak For The Weirdest Possible Reason\n\nWhat Time Is Kamala Harris’ Interview With Fox News Tonight?\n\nTrump Vs. Harris 2024 Polls: Trump Leads In Fox News Survey—Harris Up In 2 Others\n\nFor those scoring at home, that would be six runners left over four innings in a three-run game.\n\nThe Guardians finally broke through in the fifth, after again loading the bases, this time with no outs. Josh Naylor hit a sacrifice fly to cut the lead to 3-1. After a walk loaded the bases again, this time with one out, a ground ball brought home their second run. Another walk loaded the bases for the third time, now with two outs. Light-hitting catcher Austin Hedges, in the game because Vogt had pinch-hit for Bo Naylor an inning earlier, promptly struck out.\n\nFor those scoring at home, that would be nine runners left over five innings.\n\nIn the bottom of the sixth, right fielder Will Brennan bobbled a double down the line, allowing Anthony Volpe – who was being held at third – to score the Yankees’ fourth/insurance run.\n\nCleveland stranded a two-out walk in the seventh, and a two-out single in the eighth. That brought the left on base total to 11.\n\nRamírez hit a solo home run in the ninth to make it a three-run game, but two ground outs later the Guardians were in an 0-2 hole heading back home. A few clutch at bats (0-for-7 with runners in scoring position), a couple of two-out hits (1-for-10 with two walks), some better defense (2 errors leading to two unearned runs), and the game may have been entirely different. Alas, it was not meant to be.\n\nAll is not lost for Cleveland. According to MLB.com, fifteen teams have come back to win a best-of-seven series after losing the first two games. The all-time record is 76-15. Heck, the Arizona Diamondbacks did it last season against the Phillies. But, the Guardians are simply going to need to be better if they want to knock off the Yankees, especially now that it seems Aaron Judge has found his stroke.\n\nWe will see if they can right the ship on Thursday night in “The Land.”\n\nThe Cleveland Guardians hope that some home cooking can turn the ALCS around.

Her nearly-30 minute sitdown with Baier repeatedly grew heated, with the two talking over each other, as he pressed her on immigration and her changing policy stances since her first run for president in 2020.\n\nWhen Baier kept talking as Harris tried to respond to his challenges on immigration, Harris told him, “May I please finish. … You have to let me finish please.”\n\nHarris tried repeatedly to pivot the conversation to attacking Donald Trump. But she also had plenty to say about herself.\n\nA week after saying she couldn’t think of any move made by Biden that she would have done differently, Harris asserted that “My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency.”\n\nHarris did not offer specifics, but said, “Like every new president that comes into office, I will bring my life experiences, and my professional experiences and fresh and new ideas.”\n\nAsked to clarify her assertion that she wants to “turn the page,” though Democrats currently hold the White House, Harris said she is running on “turning the page from the last decade in which we have been burdened with the kind of rhetoric coming from Donald Trump.”\n\nOn immigration, Harris expressed regret over the deaths of women who were killed by people who were detained and then released after crossing into the U.S. illegally during the Biden administration, but she criticized Trump for his role in blocking a bipartisan immigration bill earlier this year that would have boosted border funding.\n\n“I am so sorry for her loss, sincerely,” Harris said after Baier played footage of the mother of Jocelyn Nungaray blaming Biden and Harris for her daughter’s death.\n\nHarris indicated she no longer supports decriminalizing crossing the border illegally, as she did in 2019.\n\n“That was five years ago and I am very clear that I will follow the law,” she said. She gave the same answer about proposals to allow those in the U.S. illegally to get driver’s licenses and subsidized healthcare.\n\nOf Trump, she said, “People are exhausted with someone who professes to be a leader and who spends full time demeaning and engaging in personal grievances.” She added, “He’s not stable.”\n\nShe also sought to focus Fox viewers on Trump’s talk of “the enemy within” and threats to punish political rivals.\n\nBaier challenged Harris over her attestations to Biden’s mental stamina after his disastrous debate with Trump in June that forced his exit from the 2024 presidential race and her elevation to the top of the ticket. She again defended Biden, but added, “Joe Biden is not on the ballot and Donald Trump is.”\n\nTrump’s campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said Harris was “angry, defensive, and once again abdicated any responsibility for the problems Americans are facing.” She added, that if “Kamala can’t handle the pressure of an interview with Fox News—she certainly can’t handle the pressure of being president of the United States.”\n\nPushing back against Baier’s line of questioning at times, Harris at one point told her interviewer, “I would like if we could have a conversation that is grounded in a full assessment of the facts.”\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Are they stupid?” he said.\n\n“Oh God, I would never say that about the American people.” the vice president responded in a shocking U-turn.\n\nWhen questioned about immigration, Harris admitted that the system was “flawed.”\n\nThe two debated the hot-button issue, with Baier bringing up crimes committed by illegal immigrants, like the murder of Rachel Morin.\n\n“Those are tragic cases. There’s no question about that,” Harris responded.\n\n“We need more judges. We need to process these cases faster.”\n\nBaier pressed her on her previous statements where she supported decriminalizing illegal border crossing, but she shut him down and reversed her stance.\n\n“I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings,” she said.\n\nBaier also grilled Harris on her support of transgender inmates getting gender-reassignment surgery.\n\nHarris simply said she wishes to follow federal law, which, under Trump, allowed for several prisons to provide gender-affirming treatments, The New York Times reported.\n\nThe vice president was questioned about her struggle to distinguish herself from Biden, to which she said she was a “new generation of leadership.”\n\n“My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency,” she said.\n\nShe went on to tout her plan for a $25,000 tax credit given to first-time homebuyers and a $50,000 tax break for small business owners.\n\nHarris continually bashed Trump despite being questioned about her current role in the White House and slammed the former president for bringing her “personal grievances” into politics.\n\n“People are tired of that,” she said.\n\n‘FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED’\n\nIn an analysis exclusively given to The U.S. Sun, political commentator Gianno Caldwell blasted Harris for using “every attempt to dodge Bret Baier’s questions.”\n\n“Her sales pitch to the American people is fundamentally flawed,” Caldwell, an analyst who founded a bipartisan political consulting firm, said.\n\n“If she has all of these great ideas, why hasn’t she implemented them over the last three-plus years?”\n\nCaldwell said Harris’ performance showed she “isn’t a presidential candidate who will serve with conviction and honesty.\n\n“Her attempts before millions of Americans failed to show a vision for Americans who are suffering over an economy, border, or inflation she created as a partner with Joe Biden or her tie-breaking vote for the $1.9T American Rescue Plan,” he said.\n\nCaldwell said America does not have the budget to back Harris’ policies.\n\n“Democrat economists warned her it would cause inflation, and it did.\n\n“That’s who Kamala Harris is and would govern as president. We cannot afford that as a country.”\n\nMEDIA BLITZ\n\nHarris’ interview comes in the midst of a media blitz to make a last-minute appeal to voters.\n\nLast week, she sat down with Stephen Colbert for the Late Show to guzzle a beer and slam Trump for “gaslighting Americans.”\n\nAnd days earlier, she made the bizarre choice to record an episode of Alex Cooper’s podcast Call Her Daddy, despite the show’s racy history.\n\nThe U.S. Sun previously spoke with a political expert who analyzed Harris’ appearances and said he didn’t believe they would sway voters.\n\n“It’s not enough just to show up on these platforms,” Matt Terrill, former chief of staff for Marco Rubio’s presidential campaign, warned.\n\n“Voters care about substance, and what voters care about right now is: ‘Where do these candidates stand?’\n\n“And, what is their plan on affordability – namely housing, healthcare, food, and fuel?\n\n“Where do they stand, and what is their plan for border security?”\n\nHarris has struggled to distinguish her vision for America from President Joe Biden’s, but last month, she boldly said she offers “a new generation of leadership.”\n\n“My focus is very much on what we can do over the next 10, 20 years to catch up to the 21st century again.\n\n“Americans want a leader who brings us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to have us point our fingers at each other.”\n\nStill, Americans appear to be almost evenly divided between Harris and Trump as Election Day nears.\n\nThe latest polling from FiveThirtyEight showed Harris ahead of Trump by just over two percentage points.\n\nBut the polls have not yet been updated following her Fox News appearance.","summary":"KAMALA Harris has swerved questions about President Joe Biden&#8217;s reported cognitive decline&#8230;","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/kamala-harris-dodges-questions-about-involvement-in-concealing-bidens-cognitive-decline-in-intense-fox-news-interview/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kamala-Harris-refuses-to-answer-questions-about-her-role-in-800x430.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:55:07","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.428},{"id":259981616,"title":"How Trump's campaign is explaining his \"father of IVF\" comments","text":"How Trump's campaign is explaining his \"father of IVF\" comments\n Former President Donald Trump spoke about in vitro fertilization during a Fox News town hall with an all-female audience that aired Wednesday.

You have to let me finish, please,\" Harris said as Baier interjected to note that some migrants who were released from custody went on to commit crimes. \"I'm in the middle of responding to the point you're raising and I'd like to finish.\" Baier played a clip of the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray saying she believes the border policies of the Biden administration are responsible for her daughter's death in Texas. Two undocumented men from Venezuela are charged in her death. \"So do you owe them an apology?\" Baier asked. \"I am so sorry for her loss,\" Harris said. \"I am so sorry for her loss, sincerely. But let's talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions.\" Harris was referring to a bipartisan measure that would have been the first comprehensive border security policy overhaul in decades. After months of negotiations, Republicans and Democrats reached a compromise in February that would have given the president far-reaching powers to restrict unlawful border crossings and tightened asylum rules. But Republicans ultimately pulled their support for it after former President Donald Trump announced his opposition. \"We've had a broken immigration system, transcending, by the way, Donald Trump's administration, even before. Let's all be honest about that. I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system,\" she said. \"It needs to be fixed.\" Harris also reversed a position she held in 2019, saying Wednesday, \"I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings, and I've not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president.\" The vice president also appeared earlier in the day at a campaign event in Pennsylvania, a battleground state, with more than 100 Republicans who have endorsed her in an effort to court disaffected Republicans who are put off by Trump's refusal to accept his loss in the 2020 election and his vows for retribution against his political opponents. Former Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who was part of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, was among the Republicans supporting Harris at the rally as she noted that in a typical election year their presence would be unusual. \"But not in this election,\" Harris said at the rally. \"Because at stake in this race are the democratic ideals that our founders and generations of Americans before us have fought for. At stake in this election is the Constitution of the United States.\" She called Trump \"increasingly unstable and unhinged\" and said he is \"seeking unchecked power\" as she reminded rally attendees that some former Trump administration officials have sounded the alarm about his fitness for office. \"No matter your party, no matter who you voted for the last time, there is a place for you in this campaign,\" she said. Harris also repeated her pledge to appoint a Republican to her Cabinet and establish a bipartisan council to recommend solutions for the most pressing issues facing the country if she wins.","summary":"The nearly 30-minute interview with Fox News was tense from the start.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kamala-harris-fox-news-interview/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/16/73112a70-2619-444d-84e7-8ea08bb53b97/thumbnail/1200x630g4/2233c3a017cb20f54675dd4b633b54be/gettyimages-2178062836.jpg?v=edba3a63b5392b4c81ae19d894992d91","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3269881_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:42:11","author":"Caitlin Yilek","authors":["Caitlin Yilek"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":259980394,"title":"Kamala Harris lacks any solutions for the border crisis","text":"Kamala Harris refuses to discuss the border issue, avoids sharing the real facts about it, and lacks a solution for addressing the border challenges.\n\nThat’s the main takeaway from Fox News’ Bret Baier’s incisive questioning Wednesday night, which exposed Harris as an angry partisan with no other platform than “blame Donald Trump.”\n\nFinally facing an interviewer who wasn’t giving her hugs and cookies, Harris tried monologuing an irrelevant answer about the flood of illegal immigrants.\n\nWhen Baier called her out, she bristled, said “let me finish” and then continued to not answer the question.\n\nShe refused to take any responsibility.

We recognized from day one … it is a priority for us as a nation … and our focus has been on fixing a problem.”\n\nBaier noted that the bill cited by Harris would have allowed 1.8 million asylum-seekers who illegally crossed the border into the country each year and that six Senate Democrats voted against it.\n\n“Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, they are young women who were brutally assaulted and killed by some of the men who were released at the beginning of the administration, well before a negotiated bipartisan bill,” Baier pressed.\n\n“Former President Clinton actually referred to Laken Riley Sunday campaigning for you in Georgia, saying if those men had been properly vetted, Laken Riley probably would not have been killed…This is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country. So what I’m saying to you, do you owe those families really an apology?”\n\nHarris replied, without accepting blame for the tragedies, “I can’t imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred.”\n\n“It was a policy decision in the early part of your administration,” Baier pressed, before playing a clip of Nungaray’s mother testifying to Congress this year that “I believe the Biden-Harris administration’s open border policies are responsible for the death of my daughter.”\n\n“I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced,” Harris said.\n\nBaier pivoted into questioning the vice president on her support in 2019 as a Democratic presidential primary candidate for decriminalizing border crossings.\n\n“I do not believe in decriminalizing border crossings and I’ve not done that as vice president. I will not do that as president,” Harris said, confirming her policy evolution on the matter.\n\nWhen pressed on her 2019 support for taxpayer-funded gender reassignment surgeries for federal prisoners, including illegal immigrants, Harris countered that “I will follow the law, and it’s a law that Donald Trump actually followed.”\n\nWhen Baier pointed out that there were no such surgeries under Trump, Harris countered, “well, you know, you gotta take responsibility for what happened in your administration” — triggering a deluge of online commentary about her own refusal to do so.\n\nLater in the interview, Harris dodged questions on whether she believes that it’s time to tighten the enforcement of oil sanctions against Iran and about when she realized that Biden, 81, appeared to be in cognitive decline, which prompted the Democratic mutiny that forced him to relinquish the party’s nomination on July 21.\n\n“Critics say that you either relaxed or failed to enforce sanctions on Iran, allowing all of this money to flow into Iran, like billions in oil profits,” Baier said.\n\n“Let’s go back to Donald Trump, who pulled out of, who pulled out of the deal that would have actually put Iran in check,” Harris countered, referring to the 45th president’s decision to end the Obama-era nuclear deal and instead ramp up sanctions on Tehran.\n\nHarris and Baier talked over each other as the journalist said, “Madam vice president, all of this money that has gone in the past few years, critics say that it goes to Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis.”\n\nThe vice president said, “I would like that we would have a conversation that is grounded in full assessment of the facts.”\n\nA bipartisan coalition of 62 House members — including Democrats Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell of California — in January asked Biden to fully enforce US sanctions on Iranian oil exports after sales surged, now roughly tripling Iran’s annual export levels in 2019 or 2020.\n\n“Iran now exports more than 1.4 million barrels of crude oil daily, over 80% of which goes to China. From February 2021 to October 2023, the regime has taken at least $88 billion from these illicit oil exports,” wrote the group. “Iran is deriving significant economic benefits from pervasive sanctions evasion, with Iran’s annual economic growth increasing by more than four percent and net foreign currency reserves up by 45[%].”\n\nHarris also refused to address when she noticed that Biden was slowing cognitively. \n\n“When did you first notice that President Biden’s mental faculties appeared diminished?” Baier asked.\n\n“Joe Biden, I have watched him from the Oval Office to the Situation Room, and he has the judgment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people. Bret, Joe Biden is not on the ballot,” she deflected.\n\nBaier pressed: “You met with him at least once a week for three and a half years. You didn’t have any concerns?”\n\nHarris redirected, “I think the American people have a concern about Donald Trump, which is why the people who know him best, including leaders of our national security community, have all spoken out.”\n\nThe Democratic nominee is currently trailing Trump in swing states Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania while only narrowly leading in Wisconsin, according to the RealClearPolitics average of recent polls.","summary":"\"You gotta take responsibility for what happened in your administration,\" Harris said, triggering a deluge of online commentary about her own refusal to do so.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/us-news/harris-deflects-on-border-iran-and-biden-decline-during-bad-tempered-fox-news-interview/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/kamala-harris-fox-news-interview-91746468.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/BqbGKB9y-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:41:19","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.517},{"id":259981654,"title":"Harris defends Biden’s mental fitness (VIDEO)","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris has defended the mental fitness of US President Joe Biden during a contentious interview with Fox News.\n\nBiden suspended his re-election campaign in July amid the growing concerns about his age and mental decline and named Harris as his successor. \n\nHost Bret Baier asked Harris on Wednesday when did she “first notice that President Biden’s mental faculties appeared diminished.” \n\nThe vice president replied that she had watched Biden’s actions “from the Oval Office to the Situation Room.” \n\n“He has the judgment and experience to do exactly what he has done in making very important decisions on behalf of the American people,” the VP insisted. \n\nWhen Baier tried to ask a follow-up question, Harris interrupted and pivoted to attacking her Republican rival, former President Donald Trump, whom she repeatedly called “unstable.” “Joe Biden is not on the ballot, and Donald Trump is,” she said, adding that the American people “have a concern” about Trump’s aptitude to lead the country again.\n\nWhile initially reluctant to step down, Biden finally withdrew his candidacy after a disastrous televised debate with Trump, where he appeared confused and often struggled to finish sentences.

The FCC must act swiftly to restore public confidence in our news media.”\n\nThe Tiffany Network has faced a flood of backlash for airing an edited version of Harris’ answer about US relations with Israel on Oct. 7 after broadcasting her “word salad” reply to the same question during a promo for the upcoming special on CBS’ “Face the Nation” the day before.\n\nIn her answer to a question by Bill Whitaker that aired Sunday on “Face the Nation,” Harris said: \n\n“Well, Bill … the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.”\n\nDuring the prime-time broadcast of “60 Minutes” the next night, Harris’ answer was cleaned up: “We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.”\n\nCBS has maintained that the answer was to the same question from Whitaker but that was edited for time constraints.\n\nBut Suhr dismissed the excuse.\n\n“CBS crosses a line when its production reaches the point of so transforming an interviewee’s answer that it is a fundamentally different answer,” the filing said.\n\nHarris’ campaign has since fought to distance itself from the network’s editing controversy.\n\nNews distortion “must involve a significant event and not merely a minor or incidental aspect of the news report” to be considered a policy violation, according to the FCC.\n\nCAR argued that CBS’ editing of Harris’ interview fit those violation requirements.\n\n“The question is incredibly consequential – U.S. foreign policy toward the Middle East in the middle of a war – and the timing is also significant: weeks before a presidential election, and with a candidate who has sat for very few news interviews,” the filing said.\n\nSuhr, who worked as a policy director for former Wisconsin Gov.

Given Biden’s unpopularity in public opinion polls, Harris’s answer drew criticism that her tenure would be merely a Biden sequel. NBC News reported that Harris' campaign was looking for a chance for her to put more space between the two of them. On Tuesday, Biden appeared to give her his blessing to do so, saying she would \"cut her own path\" as president. Harris took the rare step of appearing on the conservative network in hopes of appealing to Republican and independent voters who don’t normally tune into the more mainstream news sources. In a race with Republican Donald Trump that is too close to call, Harris is looking to make a case to voters who are not part of the Democratic coalition but who aren’t sold on four more years of Trump. The interview was possibly the most contentious of Harris’s campaign: both she and Baier had something to prove. Fox News’ conservative viewership wanted to see a hard-hitting interview while Harris needed to look strong and show the level of authority that Americans expect of a commander-in-chief. The two frequently talked over and past one another, as Baier sought to pin her down on issues including the border, the economy and any misgivings she might have about Biden’s fitness for office. Harris held her ground and insisted that she be allowed to finish her sentences, while Baier pressed for short, clear answers that would enable him to cover maximum ground. \"I'm in the middle of responding to the point you're raising, and I'd like to finish,\" Harris, as she parried one of his questions about immigration. Harris became the nominee after Biden dropped out of the race amid sluggish poll numbers and concerns among Democrats that, at 81, he was showing signs of infirmity that made him unelectable. Biden's frailties had been an issue for years, but received renewed attention following a dismal debate performance in June against Trump. Baier pressed Harris on whether she had noticed that Biden was diminished. She countered by saying Biden has been up to the job and quickly pivoted to Trump, casting him as the one who can't meet the demands of the presidency. \"Joe Biden is not on the ballot,\" she said. \"Trump is.\" She cited former Trump senior officials who've said he's unfit to serve as president. \"I think the American people have concerns about Donald Trump,\" she said. Baier sought to elicit answers on what Trump has sought to amke the overriding campaign issue: border security. He mentioned crimes that have been committed by illegal immigrants under the Biden-Harris administration’s watch. While voicing sympathy for victims and conceding the immigration system is broken, Harris said that Congress had worked out a bipartisan bill aimed at strengthening border security that Trump derailed through his influence with GOP lawmakers. She also blamed Congress for failing to pass a comprehensive immigration bill that Biden unveiled on the first day of his presidency in 2021 that would have that was aimed at both clamping down on illegal immigration and offering a path to citizenship for the millions of Americans living in the country illegally. Polls show that voters see Harris as an agent of change. \"You've been vice president for three-and-a-half years,\" Baier said \"What are you turning the page from?\" Harris mentioned Trump, who has either run for president or served in the job steadily since 2015. She said she wanted to move past \"the decade in which we've been burned from the kind of rhetoric that Donald Trump\" has used to \"divide our country and have Americans literally point fingers at each other.\" If Trump is so flawed, why do so many Americans support his candidacy, Baier asked. Does she believe voters are dumb? \"I've never said that,\" Harris said. Turning back to Trump, she said, \"He's the one who tends to demean and belittle the American people.\" She mentioned Trump's repeated mention of \"the enemy within\" that lurks within the U.S. and voiced concern that Trump would use the U.S. military to deal with such nebulous threats.","summary":"In a combative interview with Fox News, Kamala Harris said in the most emphatic terms to date that, if she wins the election, she would pursue an independent presidency that would not be a repeat of President Joe Biden’s nearly four years in office.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/harris-spars-fox-news-host-says-not-continuation-biden-rcna175742","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-10/241016-kamala-harris-se-405p-a3ac5a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:38:42","author":"Peter Nicholas","authors":["Peter Nicholas"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":259980758,"title":"Harris Calls on Republican Voters to Put ‘Country First’ as Trump Woos Latino Voters","text":"WASHINGTON CROSSING, Pa. (AP) — Surrounded by more than 100 former Republican officeholders and officials, Democrat Kamala Harris urged GOP voters on Wednesday to put “country first” and abandon Donald Trump.\n\nThe Democratic presidential candidate made her case to Republican voters that the patriotic choice was her party in next month’s election because Trump is “unstable” and “unhinged” and would eviscerate democratic norms if given a second White House term.\n\n“America must heed this warning,” said Harris, speaking at a rally near where Gen. George Washington led hundreds of troops across the Delaware River to a major victory in the Revolutionary War.\n\nJoined by the former lawmakers and government officials for a rally in the Philadelphia suburbs, Harris said, “Anyone who tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has called for the ‘termination’ of the Constitution of the United States as Donald Trump has, must never again stand behind the seal of the president of the United States.”\n\nThe rally was part of Harris’ effort to appeal to a swath of Republican voters in battleground states that she believes still can be swayed.\n\nWith 20 days to go, Harris is hoping to tear away any Republican or on-the-fence voter by warning that Trump is looking to govern with “unchecked power.” She has pledged to nominate a Republican to her Cabinet and create a bipartisan council to advise her on policy matters if elected.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump addressed Latino voters in Miami, Florida. It’s a group that historically has leaned Democratic but that Republicans have made inroads with.\n\nTrump is walking a tightrope as he looks to woo Latino voters.\n\nOn Wednesday, he defended his call for mass deportation of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, even as he nodded to a need for immigrant labor during a town hall-style event on Univision, the nation’s largest Spanish-language network.\n\n“We want workers, and we want them to come in, but they have to come in legally, and they have to love our country,” the Republican presidential candidate said during the event, scheduled to air Wednesday evening. Trump was answering the question of Jorge Velásquez, a farm worker who said most people doing such jobs are undocumented and suggested, if they’re deported, food prices will increase.\n\nTrump then returned to his criticism of Harris for being a critical player in the Biden administration’s that presided over an influx of migrants with criminal backgrounds.\n\nThe event featured pointed questions for Trump, about his wife Melania’s support for abortion rights, noted in her new memoir, and about the Jan. 6, 2021, siege of the U.S. Capitol by his supporters who breached the building in an attempt to stop the certification of the 2020 election results.\n\n“Your own vice president doesn’t want to support you now,” said Ramiro Gonzalez, of Tampa, Florida, a Republican who said he was no longer registered with the party but wanted to give Trump the chance to win him back. Gonzalez was referring to former Vice President Mike Pence, who has disavowed Trump in light of Jan. 6.\n\nTrump’s response: “Hundreds of thousands of people come to Washington. They didn’t come because of me. They came because of the election. They thought the election was a rigged election. That’s why they came.”\n\n“That was a day of love from the standpoint of the millions,” Trump told Gonzalez.\n\nHarris was in Bucks County, a vote-rich stretch of suburban Philadelphia where Democrats have held a narrow advantage in recent presidential elections. Her advisers believe she needs to improve her margins in Philadelphia and surrounding suburbs to win the state’s 19 electoral votes.\n\nHarris was joined for her rally by former Reps. Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania, Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois as well as Republican officials from every administration going back to Ronald Reagan.\n\n“No matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign,” Harris said. “The coalition we have built has room for everyone who is ready to turn the page on the chaos and instability of Donald Trump.”\n\nSeveral of the GOP surrogates said that supporting a Democrat felt awkward but was necessary due to Trump’s rejection of electoral norms and his support of the rioters who tried to stop the certification of his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden.\n\n“You know, Donald Trump may be running as a Republican, but the truth is, he does not share those long held Republican values of supporting democracy, of standing for the rule of law, and a faithfulness to the Constitution as a Republican,” Kinzinger said. “That saddens me.”\n\nHarris tapped a couple, Pennsylvania farmers Bob and Kristina Lange who had previously backed Trump, to introduce her at the rally. Bob twice voted for Trump and Kristina backed him in 2016.\n\n“Never in a million years did either of us think that we’d be standing here supporting a Democrat,” Kristina Lange said. “But we’ve had enough. We’ve had enough.”\n\nSome of the rallygoers who have voted Republican in the past said they were looking for the party to rewind to its fiscal conservative roots.\n\n“We need more Republicans to stand up and say, ‘This is not what our party is about, this is not what we are about,’” said Sarah Larson, 53, of East Rockhill Township, who last voted for a Republican presidential candidate in 2008 when John McCain was at the top of the ticket. “It’s not what we recognize anymore as Republican values – which is less government, more freedom – right now.”\n\nWhile in Pennsylvania, Harris conducted an interview with Fox News’ Bret Baier in which the two sparred over immigration policy and her shifting policy positions over the years, among other things. A week after saying she couldn’t think of any move made by Biden that she would have done differently, Harris asserted that “My presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency.”\n\nTrump and Harris also campaigned in Pennsylvania Monday, when the Republican was in nearby Oaks while Harris was on the opposite end of the state in Erie County, among Pennsylvania’s most closely divided counties over the past two presidential contests.\n\nHarris’ simplest path toward the 270-vote winning threshold in the Electoral College is by carrying a trio of northern battleground states, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Harris campaigned in Detroit Tuesday and planned to campaign in three Wisconsin cities Thursday.","summary":"WASHINGTON CROSSING, Pa.

As a journalist, I said to myself this is not journalism and this is not responsible reporting. It is pure hatred.”\n\nA flyer promoting the event and featuring Trump's \"Make America Great Again (MAGA)\" campaign slogan has been circulated on social media and has generated widespread attention.\n\nGeorge said she began sharing the flyer three days ago to a few friends, and since its dissemination, she has received numerous calls.\n\n“Since the brochure has been out, people have been constantly calling. Some people are in shock because they do not believe this is actually happening in our country.

Three out of four respondents also expressed concerns about violence associated with the presidential elections.\n\n“Even in the solidly blue Bay State, there is clear concern about the state of the national economy and the direction of the country,” said poll co-director and political science associate professor Alexander Theodoridis. “In this environment, it is no surprise that both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump are jockeying to position themselves as the change candidate in this year’s presidential election.”\n\nElected officials, including Gov.

In a combative interview with Fox News host Bret Baier, Harris was asked to defend the administration’s early decision to reverse some of Republican rival Donald Trump’s restrictive policies, and to respond to a mother who testified in Congress about the loss of her child at the hands of an illegal immigrant.\n\n“I’m so sorry for her loss, but let’s talk about what is happening right now,” Harris said.\n\nHarris said Trump told Republicans to reject a bipartisan immigration bill because “he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem.” The interview was part of a direct appeal by Harris on Wednesday to Republican voters in this year’s U.S. presidential election, as she highlighted Republican support for her campaign in a battleground county in Pennsylvania before appearing on conservative-leaning Fox News.\n\nHarris was asked in the Fox News interview about her recent comment that there was “not a thing” she would change about the actions of the Biden administration, responding: “let me be very clear, my presidency will not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s presidency,” but she did not elaborate. Earlier, in Bucks County, outside of Philadelphia, Harris emphasized Trump’s attempt to overturn his election loss four years ago, when he lost the White House to current President Joe Biden.\n\nHarris said Trump’s actions violated the U.S. Constitution and, if given the chance, he will violate it again.\n\n“He refused to accept the will of the people and the results of a free and fair election. He sent a mob, an armed mob, to the United States Capitol, where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials and threatened the life of his own vice president,” Harris said. Over 100 Republicans joined Harris in Bucks County, including Adam Kinzinger, a former congressman and member of the committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol by supporters of then-President Trump.\n\n“No matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign,” Harris said. Harris led Republican candidate Trump by a marginal 46% to 43% in a recent Reuters poll.\n\nTrump on Wednesday will participate in a town hall hosted by Univision. And Fox News aired a separate Trump town hall with an all-women audience.\n\nHarris has previously attempted to court voters disillusioned by Trump. Earlier this month, former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, daughter to former Vice President Dick Cheney, urged voters to put country over party and vote for Harris, saying that Trump was not fit to lead the U.S.\n\nShe reiterated on Wednesday her pledge to nominate a Republican for her cabinet, if elected.\n\nHarris’ speech took place near where George Washington and thousands of American soldiers crossed the Delaware River, setting up for a Revolutionary War victory over British troops, and came as early voting began in the area on Tuesday.\n\nBiden beat Trump in Bucks County by about 17,000 votes in the 2020 election, while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the 2016 election by under 3,000 votes, according to county data.\n\nThis summer, Republicans overtook Democrats in the number of voter registrations for the first time in a generation. Republicans currently have some 3,500 more voters in the county than Democrats, according to the latest data. She is also weighing joining the podcaster Joe Rogan, whose show reaches millions of men across the political spectrum, and who has joked that a “puppet master” was behind Harris’ strong debate performance against Trump.","summary":"WASHINGTON CROSSING, Pennsylvania >> Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris was grilled in a TV interview on Wednesday on the Biden administration&#8217;s efforts to tackle a surge in illegal immigration at the southern border, and laid the blame on Republicans for failing to pass a border bill. In a combative interview with Fox News host Bret Baier, Harris was asked to defend the administration&#8217;s early decision to reverse some of Republican rival Donald Trump&#8217;s restrictive policies, and to respond to a mother who testified in Congress about the loss of her child at the hands of an illegal immigrant.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/10/16/breaking-news/harris-grilled-on-immigration-in-combative-fox-interview/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/web1_20241016_brk_tru02.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:30:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":259980420,"title":"'Apprentice' Star Says Donald Trump Losing 'to a Woman of Color Would be Devastating to His Ego’","text":"Author and reality star Omarosa Manigault Newman has recently announced her support for Kamala Harris. Given her past connection with Donald Trump, many were shocked by her choice. Newman is a former contestant of The Apprentice, who went on to become one of Trump's favorites. Later, at the Trump White House, she oversaw the communications division of the Office of Public Liaison. In 2017 she left her job and published her controversial memoir, titled- Unhinged: An Insider's Account of the Trump White House.\n\nAccording to a Variety article, while showing her support for Kamala, Newman said, \"Donald Trump has been defeated before, and I think what’s grating on his nerves the most is that this [next] defeat may come at the hands of a woman of color. He reserves his most vitriolic attacks for women of color. To lose to a woman of color would be devastating to his ego.\" She also feels that a victory for Harris would represent a powerful and transformative moment for young black girls and boys, as it would mark the first time a woman holds the position of commander in chief. “But to get this close is still so significant,\" she added, as reported by The Hill.\n\nThe reality star continued, \"I believe the nation will choose the leader they need at this time, and I believe that that leader is Vice President Kamala Harris.\" The interviewer then asked her about Trump's unrealized potential. Newman claimed that while writing her memoir, Unhinged, she gave this some thought. She said that Trump lost an opportunity to be a great leader who might have led the country into a better future, Talking about Trump's rambling, she said that anyone can see that his vocabulary is limited. He rambles and often says things that seem to come out of nowhere.\n\nIn her 2018 memoir Unhinged, Newman recalled her experiences from the Trump White House. She portrayed the former president as both 'racist' and 'mentally impaired', as reported by The Independent. Trump's campaign later took legal action against Newman. They claimed that Newman breached a non-disclosure agreement. Although Trump lost the case in September 2021, the two sides continued to argue over the details of the settlement. Newman has since expressed her concerns that a second Trump administration could be even more extreme and unrestrained than the first.\n\nTrump has previously encountered criticism from the author for his racial relations tactics. Earlier this year, Trump claimed that millions of immigrants brought in by Joe Biden were taking on \"black jobs.\" According to USA Today, Newman called Trump's comments outrageous and claimed that people are starting to understand that he would not be able to handle the country's racial issues. She was perhaps one of the most well-known Black personalities in the Trump White House.","summary":"Given her past connection with Donald Trump, many were shocked by her choice.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/apprentice-star-says-donald-trump-losing-to-a-woman-of-color-would-be-devastating-to-his-ego","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/720387/uploads/2829e6a0-8bb9-11ef-9ef4-b3f1461c8cc8_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:30:00","author":"INQUISITR,Simran Kumari","authors":["INQUISITR","Simran Kumari"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.285},{"id":259979570,"title":"Harris Talks About Using Taxes for Gender Reassignment Surgery for Inmates: I Will Consider it, Similar to Trump, but it’s not a priority and could be causing anxiety.","text":"During an interview with the Fox News Channel’s “Special Report” on Wednesday, 2024 Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris responded to a question on if she still supports taxpayer dollars paying for gender transition surgeries for federal prisoners or detained migrants by stating that she’ll “follow the law” just as her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump did during her administration to provide such surgeries, when medically needed to those in the federal prison system and Trump is “trying to create a sense of fear in the voters…on an issue that, as it relates to the biggest issues that affect the American people, it’s really quite remote.”\n\nHost Bret Baier asked, “So, are you still in support of using taxpayer dollars to help prison inmates or detained illegal aliens to transition to another gender?”\n\nHarris answered, “I will follow the law.

Baier began the interview Wednesday by asking Harris how many illegal immigrants were released by the Biden administration into the country. \"Well, I'm glad you raised the issue of immigration, because I agree with you,\" Harris responded. It is a topic of discussion that people want to rightly have. And you know what I'm going to talk about-\" \"But just a number,\" Baier pressed. \"Do you think it's 1 million? 3 million?\" \"Bret, let's just get to the point, ok?\" Harris said. \"The point is that we have a broken immigration system that needs to be repaired.\" LAKEN RILEY ACT SPONSOR BLASTS BILL CLINTON'S CLAIM ABOUT GEORGIA STUDENT'S DEATH After Baier invoked DHS estimated that 6 million illegal immigrants had been released into the country, he then pressed her about the Biden administration's decision to reverse Trump-era policies like Remain in Mexico and how that decision is linked to the release of violent criminals. \"So looking back, do you regret the decision to terminate Remain in Mexico at the beginning of your administration?\" Baier asked. Harris responded by highlighting the Biden administration's first legislative push, which was immigration reform, and accused Trump of killing a bipartisan immigration bill. KAMALA HARRIS DODGES COLBERT'S QUESTION ON WHAT ‘MAJOR CHANGES’ SHE'D BRING VERSUS BIDEN PRESIDENCY The \"Special Report\" anchor then turned to the high-profile murders of Jocelyn Nungaray, Rachel Morin and Lake Riley, all victims at the hands of violent illegal immigrants who entered the country during the Biden administration. \"This is a specific policy decision by your administration to release these men into the country,\" Baier said. \"So what I'm saying to you, do you owe those families an apology?\" \"Let me just say- first of all, those are tragic cases. There's no question about that. There's no question about that,\" Harris said. \"And I can't imagine the pain that the families of those victims have experienced for a loss that should not have occurred. So that is true. It is also true that if [the border security bill] had actually been passed nine months ago, it would be nine months that we would have had more border agents at the border, more support for the folks who are working around the clock trying to hold it all together to ensure that no future harm would occur.\" KAMALA HARRIS TELLS ‘THE VIEW’ SHE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING SHE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN \"Madam Vice President, it was a policy decision in the early part of your administration,\" Baier later pressed before turning to testimony from Jocelyn Nungaray's mother, who said the Biden-Harris administration was responsible for her daughter's murder. \"So do you owe them an apology is what I'm saying,\" Baier again asked. \"I will tell you that I'm so sorry for her loss. I'm so sorry for her loss. Sincerely. But let's talk about what is happening right now with an individual who does not want to participate in solutions,\" Harris responded. \"Let's talk about that as well. In all fairness, I told you I feel awful for what she and her family have experienced.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"You said repeatedly that the border was secure, when in your mind, did it start becoming a crisis?\" Baier then asked. \"We've had a broken immigration system transcending, by the way, Donald Trump's administration, even before. Let's all be honest about that,\" Harris said. \"I have no pride in saying that this is a perfect immigration system. I've been clear. I think we all know that it needs to be fixed. We need more- I was just down at the border talking with border agents… we need more judges. We need to process those cases faster. We need the support for cases that should be prosecuted. They need more resources, and Congress, ultimately, is the only place that that's going to get fixed, Bret. That's how this system works.\" When Baier asked Harris if she still supports taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries for illegal immigrants who are in custody, Harris pivoted to Trump. \"I will follow a law. A law that Donald Trump actually followed. You're probably familiar with now, it's a public report, that under Donald Trump's administration, these surgeries were available to, on a medical necessity basis, to people in the federal prison system.

A complete cratering.\n\nIn his many tangles with the mainstream media, JD Vance is showing them why this is.\n\nVance in recent weeks has repeatedly schooled anchors, hosts and reporters in basic facts about the economy, the law and other core topics, demonstrating again and again how siloed they have become from ordinary Americans.\n\nEither they wall themselves off from sources that challenge their worldview — to the point they simply don’t understand reality — or they can afford to ignore those truths, because things like crime, inflation and the impact of illegal immigration don’t impact them in any way they can actually feel.\n\nIt’s how the industry totally missed Trump’s victory in 2016, because almost none of its members spoke to voters in places like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.And by operating in this bubble, these journalists-turned-activists have made themselves ignorant.\n\nEver since Donald Trump chose Vance as his running mate, the former Marine and current Ohio senator has been going into hostile media environments: The New York Times podcast, CNN, CBS, NBC, ABC and more — a refreshing change at a time when risk-averse politicians tend to hide in their safe spaces for maximum comfort.\n\nVance has shown confidence and conviction against reporters and anchors hell-bent on portraying him as a “weird,” “extreme” elitist (that last one is particularly rich) for having had the audacity to rise out of his nightmarish Rust Belt upbringing and graduate from Yale Law School.\n\nMore important, his appearances show voters he understands what the real world is like for average folks living outside of an elitist ecosystem — unlike his media antagonists.Every time, they set out to play a hostile game of gotcha with Vance — and every time, he shows them up.During the vice presidential debate, for example, CBS moderator Margaret Brennan made an erroneous attempt to fact-check Vance on the law regarding illegal immigration, and he accurately fact-checked her right back.\n\nIn the midst of his truthful retort, CBS cut his mic to avoid being humiliated before tens of millions of viewers.\n\nThis week, Vance took ABC’s Martha Raddatz to school when she argued that violent Venezuelan gangs had seized only “a handful of apartment complexes” in Aurora, Colo., as she tried to accuse the Republicans of manufacturing an issue.\n\n“Martha, do you hear yourself?” Vance answered with an incredulous grin. “Only ‘a handful of apartment complexes’ were taken over by Venezuelan gangs, and Donald Trump is the problem and not Kamala Harris’ open border?”Perhaps that’s why social-media platforms like X are dominating our political discourse, while ABC, NBC, CBS and CNN are seeing their audience numbers drop year after year.\n\nLook at the numbers when X user Collin Rugg posted video of the Vance-Raddatz encounter: His clip got 1.7 million views; similar posts on other right-leaning accounts racked up at least 3.6 million more.\n\nCompare that to Raddatz’s audience: About 2.3 million viewers tuned into the show last week, far fewer than those who saw the exchange on social media.Ultimately, calling out the media when they promote falsehoods or dismiss crises or push Democrat-friendly narratives is a smart political strategy for the GOP.\n\nPast presidential candidates like the late John McCain and Mitt Romney believed that if they were friendly and accommodating enough, the press would come to like them and therefore give them more positive coverage.That never happened. \n\nThey both lost to Barack Obama, because he was the media’s guy no matter what the Republicans did or how they brown-nosed.Donald Trump changed all that in 2016. He didn’t play along when anchors and reporters pushed garbage documents like the dubious Steele dossier, or when they later dismissed legitimate bombshells like Hunter Biden’s laptop.\n\nVance uses the same approach — but does so with a smile and specifics.\n\nSo when Vance and Trump call out the media, let’s just say that, according to Gallup, very few Americans are cheering for the so-called Fourth Estate.And if Trump wins this election, his decision to choose Vance may go down as the best one of his campaign.\n\nJoe Concha is the author of “Progressively Worse: Why Today’s Democrats Ain’t Your Daddy’s Donkeys.”","summary":"JD Vance keeps schooling the media because by operating in their bubble, journalists-turned-activists have made themselves ignorant.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/16/opinion/vances-media-burns-reveal-elite-is-siloed-from-reality/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-ud933y2e3-1729119501590.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1729105196&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:21:02","author":"Joe Concha","authors":["Joe Concha"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":259978604,"title":"Kamala Harris Struggles to Speak Up in Contentious Inaugural Interview on Fox News","text":"“I’m in the middle of responding to the point you’re raising, and I’d like to finish,” Vice President Kamala Harris sternly told Fox News’ Brett Baier today in her first appearance on the Rupert Murdoch-owned as the anchor repeatedly spoke over her\n\nJumping into the belly of the beast at the conservative cable newser for the first time in her long career, Harris found herself being pillared by Baier, especially over illegal immigration and border security. At the same time, having been roasted online by the MAGA base in anticipation of softball questions, “real journalist” (as the VP called him at one point) Baier barely let the VP get a word in during the opening part of the sit-down.\n\nIt wasn’t a good look for Fox, and a gift to Harris who got to play tough in Trump’s media backyard and lean into her rival’s mental decline. Raising her voice several times, the VP once again went hard on her default position that Trump is fundamentally “unstable” and dangerous to have back in the Oval Office.\n\nAs Baier played largely to the MAGA base and his core viewership, the veteran anchor appeared largely out of his depth.

In many ways, today’s antagonistic faceoff resembled debates Joe Biden and Harris have had with Trump where the latter tried to dominate with long-winded put downs and exaggerations.\n\nWhich Harris alluded to near the end of the 30-minute sit-down\n\n“I would like that we would have a conversation that is grounded in full assessments of the facts,” the VP told Baier after several more interruptions and a whitewashing of Trump’s threat of using the military against “radical left lunatics.”\n\n“I think this interview is supposed to be about the choices that your viewers should be presented about this election, and the contrast is important,” she said at the conclusion of Wednesday back and forth.\n\nAs the conversation progressed, Harris started to flip the script, raise her voice and talk over Baier to get her points across. “It’s not supposed to be easy, it’s not supposed to be a cake walk,” the VP sternly said to the anchor of how close the election is. She went on to criticize Trump’s attacks and insults against Americans who don’t support him and threatening to take revenge upon his enemies if he gets back in the White House. “I would never say that about the American people,” Harris emphasized, noting all the former members of the Trump administration and the military who say his \n\nDuring one exchange, Harris pushed back at a clip Baier played of Trump laughing off his “enemy within” statements and accusing the Democrats of weaponizing the government against their political enemies. “With all due respect, that clip was not what he has been saying about the enemy within,” the VP insisted in what may be the clip of interview for her supporters. “That’s not what you just showed,” Harris added, with a swipe at the media echo chambers\n\nAs Baier played largely to the MAGA base and his core viewership, the veteran anchor appeared out of his depth. Challenged on his questions and wanting to flex his own muscles, Baier ended up fumbling his line of questioning and losing control of the interview to the well-prepped VP as he got caught up in centering on culture war issues.\n\nBack in the battleground Keystone State once again, Harris held a rally Wednesday with GOP supporters like former Congressman Adam Kinzinger who are backing her against Trump.

He sent a mob, an armed mob, to the United States Capitol, where they violently assaulted police officers, law enforcement officials and threatened the life of his own vice-president,” Harris said.\nOver 100 Republicans joined Harris in Bucks County, including Adam Kinzinger, a former congressman and member of the committee that investigated the January 6 attack on the US Capitol by supporters of then-President Trump.\n“No matter your party, no matter who you voted for last time, there is a place for you in this campaign,” Harris said. Harris led Republican candidate Trump by a marginal 46 per cent to 43 per cent in a recent Reuters poll.\n\nTrump on Wednesday will take part in a town hall hosted by Univision. And Fox News aired a separate Trump town hall with an all-women audience.\nHarris has previously attempted to court voters disillusioned by Trump. Earlier this month, former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, daughter to former US vice-president Dick Cheney, urged voters to put country over party and vote for Harris, saying that Trump was not fit to lead the US.\nShe reiterated on Wednesday her pledge to nominate a Republican for her cabinet, if elected.\nHarris’ speech took place near where George Washington and thousands of American soldiers crossed the Delaware River, setting up for a Revolutionary War victory over British troops, and came as early voting began in the area on Tuesday.\nBiden beat Trump in Bucks County by about 17,000 votes in the 2020 election, while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the 2016 election by under 3,000 votes, according to county data.\nThis summer, Republicans overtook Democrats in the number of voter registrations for the first time in a generation. Republicans currently have some 3,500 more voters in the county than Democrats, according to the latest data.\nShe is also weighing joining the podcaster Joe Rogan, whose show reaches millions of men across the political spectrum, and who has joked that a “puppet master” was behind Harris’ strong debate performance against Trump.","summary":"The Democratic White House candidate tackled questions on immigration and said her presidency would not be a continuation of Joe Biden’s.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3282668/kamala-harris-grilled-combative-fox-news-interview","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/17/277a30be-f8d8-4dee-ba69-b256a6b1da41_289c0c56.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:11:23","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":259978184,"title":"Democrats See 103 Percent Increase in Pennsylvania Voters Leaving the Party","text":"Although Pennsylvania still has more registered Democrats than any other party, the number of voters leaving the party has greatly increased, with nearly twice as many as last year switching to other parties, including the GOP, according to state-released voting data.Pennsylvania is a key battleground in this presidential election, with both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris vying for its crucial Electoral College votes. The Keystone State's 19 electoral votes—more than any other swing state—could determine the outcome of the election.Trump narrowly won Pennsylvania in 2016 against Hillary Clinton, while President Joe Biden flipped it in 2020. The race in the state is expected to be decided by a few thousand votes, and both major party candidates have been repeatedly campaigning there.Weekly updated data provided by Pennsylvania's Department of State shows the party breakdown of registered voters in the state as of Monday: 3,958,835 Democrats, 3,646,110 Republicans, 1,085,677 unaffiliated and 346,211 with \"other\" affiliations.The data reports a notable shift in party registrations, showing that Pennsylvania's Democratic Party has experienced a 103 percent increase in members leaving the party this year, compared with last year.In 2023, 19,321 Pennsylvania voters changed their registration from Democrat to \"other,\" and 36,341 switched from Democrat to Republican. Overall, 55,662 registered Democrats in the state left the party.This year, the state-released data shows that 51,937 registered Democrats changed their affiliation to \"other,\" and 61,126 switched to Republican, for a total of 113,063 leaving the party.Newsweek has reached out via email to the Pennsylvania Democratic Party for comment on Wednesday.On the other hand, Republicans have seen a significant but smaller number of members leave the party, with 29,038 registered Republicans changing their affiliation—13,196 to \"other\" and 15,842 to Democrat—in 2023. This year, 48,702 Republicans switched parties, with 24,046 changing to \"other\" and 24,656 becoming Democrats, around a 67 percent increase in Republicans leaving the party.Most Pennsylvania polls show a narrow margin between the Republican and Democratic presidential nominees, with leads fluctuating within the margin of error, making the state a toss-up.A recent New York Times/Philadelphia Inquirer/Siena College poll of 857 likely voters in the Keystone State found Harris leading the Republican nominee by 3 percentage points.The poll, conducted between October 7 and 10, shows Harris with 50 percent of the vote, compared with Trump's 47 percent. However, Harris' lead is within the margin of error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. In addition, the poll reported that 3 percent of respondents didn't know whom they supported or refused to answer.Meanwhile, an Emerson College Polling/The Hill survey of 1,000 likely Pennsylvania voters found Trump leading Harris by 1 percentage point, with 49 percent of respondents backing him and 48 percent supporting Harris. The poll, conducted between October 5 and 8, has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.Harris' clearest path to victory next month would be to win the three \"blue wall\" battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, barring any shock results elsewhere. Trump's most efficient path to 270 Electoral College votes would be to win the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia while flipping Pennsylvania.Aggregate polls, updated daily with new data, show an extremely tight race in the state. RealClearPolitics has Trump leading by 0.3 percent, 48.3 percent to Harris' 48 percent.

Trump narrowly lost Georgia to President Biden in the 2020 presidential election but claimed without proof that widespread fraud cost him victory in the state.Democratic Party organizations, local election officials and a group headed by a former Republican state lawmaker have filed at least half a dozen lawsuits over the rules. Democrats, voting rights groups and some legal experts have raised concerns that some rules could be used by Trump allies to delay or avoid certification or to cast doubt on results if he loses next month's presidential election to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.One new rule that a judge blocked requires that three separate poll workers count the number of Election Day ballots by hand to make sure the number of paper ballots matches the electronic tallies on scanners, check-in computers and voting machines.Georgia voters make selections on a touchscreen voting machine that prints out a piece of paper with a human-readable list of the voter's choices as well as a QR code. That is the ballot that the voter puts into a scanner, which records the votes. The hand-count would be of the paper ballots — not the votes.Critics, including many county election officials, argued that a hand-count could slow the reporting of election results and put an extra burden on poll workers at the end of an already long day. They also said there isn't enough time to adequately train poll workers.The rule's supporters argued the count would take extra minutes, not hours. They also noted that scanner memory cards with the vote tallies could be sent to central tabulation centers in each county while the hand-count is completed so the reporting of results would not be slowed.Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney on Tuesday had temporarily blocked the hand-count for the November election while he considers the legal merits. He said the hand-count may ultimately prove to be good policy, but it's too close to the general election to implement it now. The State Election Board could appeal.Two other new rules that Cox invalidated were passed by the Georgia State Election Board in August and have to do with certification. One provides a definition of certification that includes requiring county officials to conduct a \"reasonable inquiry\" before certifying results, but it does not specify what that means. The other includes language allowing county election officials \"to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.\"Supporters argued those rules are necessary to ensure the accuracy of the vote totals before county election officials sign off on them. Critics said they could be used to delay or deny certification.","summary":"The seven rules thrown out by a Georgia judge include one that required the number of ballots be hand-counted after the close of polls.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgia-judge-invalidates-new-state-election-rules/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/16/843c4864-6b12-475e-9f28-a3e1cc810f3a/thumbnail/1200x630g3/89cf685d9bc72deb20d9303b464c1475/gettyimages-2153452562.jpg?v=edba3a63b5392b4c81ae19d894992d91","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3270054_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:05:37","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.113},{"id":259978900,"title":"U.S. agency adopts rule to make it easier for consumers to cancel unwanted subscriptions","text":"The Federal Trade Commission adopted a final rule Wednesday that will require businesses to make it easy for consumers to cancel unwanted subscriptions and memberships.\n\nThe “click-to-cancel” rule will prohibit retailers and other businesses from misleading people about subscriptions and require them to obtain consumers’ consent before charging for memberships, auto-renewals and programs linked to free trial offers.\n\nThe FTC said businesses must also disclose when free trials or other promotional offers will end and let customers end recurring subscriptions as easily as they started them. Most of the provisions take effect effect 180 days after the rule is published in the Federal Register, the agency said.\n\n“Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” FTC Chair Lina Khan said in a statement. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.”\n\nThe Biden administration included the FTC’s proposal as part of its “Time is Money” initiative, a government-wide initiative that was announced in August with the aim of cracking down on consumer-related hassles. The initiative featured new regulations and the promise of more for industries spanning health care and fitness memberships to media subscriptions.\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce criticized the administration’s approach, saying in August that “heavy-handed regulations that micromanage business practices” will lead to higher costs for consumers.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, highlighted the “click-to-cancel” rule last month as a policy she would pursue if elected.\n\nFTC commissioners passed the final rule on a 3-2 vote. The agency, which initiated the rule in March, said it received more than 16,000 comments on the proposal, including from consumers, consumer advocacy groups and trade associations.\n\nThe Biden administration has also targeted hidden and bogus junk fees, which can mask the total cost of concert tickets, hotel rooms and utility bills.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/personal-finance/2024/10/16/ftc-consumers-click-to-cancel-unwanted-subscriptions","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7cbc562/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1713+0+144/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F8e%2Fbf%2F959bc35e417a8485f02a5c2d59c5%2Fap24","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-16 23:05:23","author":"Haleluya Hadero | AP","authors":["Haleluya Hadero | AP"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.403},{"id":259979168,"title":"US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris waves as she boards Air Force Two at the Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport in Romulus, Michigan, on October 16, 2024.
