Local authorities are banning public performances of narcocorridos, popular ballads that romanticise drug cartels.\n\nAs the country wrestles with the “effects of organized crime” and “pressure from the Trump administration to crack down on cartels”, politicians are keen to show they don’t condone songs that glorify criminal activities, said The New York Times.\nCorridos about local bandits have been popular since the “early 20th century”, said the Financial Times but, since the 1970s, a hugely successful subgenre – narcocorridos – has celebrated drug runners and ”become a key element of propaganda for cartels”.\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

These mostly take the form of heavy fines, but can also trigger a prison sentence.\nWhen Aguascalientes state “banned songs inciting violence” earlier this year, the well-known band Grupo Firme announced that they would not play narcocorridos any more, said The New York Times.\nBut fan reactions to artists abiding by state rules have, ironically, led to violence. When Luis R Conriquez – who has over 23 million monthly listeners on Spotify – said on stage that he was joining the “cause of zero corridos”, he was “booed” by the audience, who then “threw punches” at each other and “caused significant damage to the venue”, said Billboard.\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nUpsetting US authorities\nIgnoring the crackdown has already had consequences, said The Times. When the band Los Alegres del Barranco sang a song “dedicated to El Mencho, leader of the Jalisco cartel”, and projected his face “onto a giant screen behind them”, they were not only charged with “promoting crime” by the local attorney general, they also found their American visas revoked, forcing them to “cancel dozens of shows in the US”.\nThere are increasing signs that, even where there are no local narcocorrido bans in place, bands are starting to “self-censor”, fearing that “upsetting US authorities” could affect their ability to tour”, said CNN.\n“The last thing we need is a welcome mat for people who extol criminals and terrorists,” said US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau on X. “I’m a firm believer in freedom of expression but that doesn’t mean that expression should be free of consequences.”\nThe bans and the visa-revoking may be having the opposite effect to the one intended, however: figures show that Los Alegres del Barranco have “gained over 2 million new listens on streaming services”, said CNN. It seems a genre “that has long romanticised outlaws, outcasts and underdogs” still has an “enduring modern appeal”.\n\nExplore More\n\nWill Barker, The Week UK\n\nCancel culture: Now coming from the Right\n\nConservatives are encouraging the firing of hundreds of Americans over their negative opinions on Charlie Kirk\n\nCrackdown: Trump’s new blue city targets\n\nTrump has vowed to deploy the National Guard, FBI, and ICE to Memphis, naming St. Louis and New Orleans as his next targets\n\nDemocrats: Harris and Biden’s blame game\n\nKamala Harris’ new memoir reveals frustrations over Biden’s reelection bid and her time as vice president\n\nYou might also like\n\nThe US and Colombia renew their feud over the drug war\n\nIn the Spotlight\nThe US has accused Colombia of failing in its drug-fighting efforts\n\nAir strikes in the Caribbean: Trump’s murky narco-war\n\nTalking Point\nDrug cartels ‘don’t follow Marquess of Queensberry Rules’, but US military air strikes on speedboats rely on strained interpretation of ‘invasion’\n\nFlorida wages crosswalk war on public displays of pride\n\nIN THE SPOTLIGHT\nGov.

Nexstar and Sinclair, two of ABC’s largest affiliate owners, said they would pull the show from their stations.\n\nBut by Monday, ABC said the show would be back on starting Tuesday.\n\nHere is a look at some of the key disputes Trump has had with media over his second term: \n\n Sept. 22: ABC reinstates Kimmel’s late night show \n\nABC said in a statement that the decision to reinstate the show came after days of “thoughtful conversations\" with Kimmel, who has hosted his show on ABC since 2003.\n\nAndrew Kolvet, a spokesperson for Turning Point USA, the organization founded by Kirk, said in a statement on X: “Disney and ABC caving and allowing Kimmel back on the air is not surprising, but it’s their mistake to make. Nexstar and Sinclair do not have to make the same choice.”\n\nNexstar and Sinclair did not immediately respond to messages from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nWord of Kimmel's return came after hundreds of movie, TV and stage stars as well as comedians, directors and writers added their names to an open letter Monday from the American Civil Liberties Union that says it is “a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.”\n\n Sept. 19: Judges tosses Trump's lawsuit against New York Times \n\nA Florida federal judge tossed out a $15 billion defamation lawsuit that Trump filed against The New York Times. U.S. District Judge Steven Merryday ruled that Trump’s lawsuit was overly long and was full of “tedious and burdensome” language that had no bearing on the legal case.\n\n“A complaint is not a megaphone for public relations or a podium for a passionate oration at a political rally,” Merryday wrote in the order. “This action will begin, will continue, and will end in accord with the rules of procedure and in a professional and dignified manner.”\n\nThe judge ruled that Trump has 28 days to file an amended complaint that should not exceed 40 pages in length.\n\nThe lawsuit targeted four of the newspaper’s journalists, a book and three articles published within a two-month period before the 2024 presidential election. \n\nThe book and an article written by Times reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig focused on Trump’s finances and his pre-presidency starring role in television’s “The Apprentice.” \n\nTrump also cited an article by Peter Baker last Oct. 20 headlined “For Trump, a Lifetime of Scandals Heads Toward a Moment of Judgment\" and a Michael S. Schmidt piece two days later featuring an interview with Trump’s first-term chief of staff, John Kelly, headlined “As Election Nears, Kelly Warns Trump Would Rule Like a Dictator.”\n\nThe Times has called the lawsuit meritless and an attempt to discourage independent reporting. \n\n July 18: Trump sues The Wall Street Journal \n\nTrump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against The Wall Street Journal and media mogul Rupert Murdoch whose News Corp owns the paper. The move came a day after the Journal published a story reporting on his ties to financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe article described a sexually suggestive letter that the newspaper says bore Trump’s name and was included in a 2003 album compiled for Epstein’s 50th birthday. \n\nThe Justice Department had earlier asked a federal court to unseal grand jury transcripts in Epstein’s sex trafficking case. The Trump administration had announced it would not be releasing additional files from the case.\n\n July 18: ‘The Late Show With Stephen Colbert’ canceled \n\nCBS announced it would cancel “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” next May. Colbert is one of Trump’s most prominent and persistent late-night critics. CBS said “Late Show” was canceled for financial reasons, not for content. However, the announcement came three days after Colbert criticized the settlement between Trump and CBS parent company Paramount Global over the “60 Minutes” story. \n\n July 2: CBS owner agrees to settlement with Trump \n\nParamount Global decided to pay Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit regarding editing of a CBS’ “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last October. At the time Harris was the Democratic candidate for president. \n\nTrump’s lawyers claimed he suffered “mental anguish” following the interview and sued for $20 billion. The company was hoping to put the issue to rest as it sought administration approval of a merger. Paramount, which owns CBS, said the money will go to Trump’s future presidential library and to pay his legal fees.\n\n May 1: Trump slashes funding for PBS and NPR \n\nTrump signed an executive order aimed at slashing public subsidies to PBS and NPR and alleged “bias” in the broadcasters’ reporting. His order instructed the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and other federal agencies “to cease Federal funding for NPR and PBS” and further requires that that they work to root out indirect sources of public financing for the news organizations. \n\nLater that month, NPR and three of its local stations sued Trump, arguing that the order violated their free speech and relies on an authority that he does not have. This summer, Congress approved eliminating $1.1 billion allocated to public broadcasting.\n\n Feb. 12: Trump removes The Associated Press from White House press pool \n\nTrump decided to remove The Associated Press from the White House press pool. That meant AP journalists no longer would have access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and other events not open to a full press corps. The move was in retaliation for AP’s decision not to follow his lead in changing the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America in all instances.\n\nThe AP Stylebook calls for referring to the body of water by its original name while acknowledging the new name Trump chose. The reasoning is that AP disseminates news around the world and must ensure that place names and geography are easily recognizable to all audiences. \n\nThe wire service later sued Trump and a district court sided with the AP in April, affirming on First Amendment grounds that the government cannot punish the news organization for the content of its speech. A federal appeals court in June stayed that decision. \n\n December 2024: ABC agrees to settle defamation lawsuit \n\nABC News agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump’s presidential library as part of a defamation lawsuit settlement over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ inaccurate on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable of raping writer E. Jean Carroll. The network also agreed to pay $1 million in legal fees. \n\nThe settlement agreement described ABC’s presidential library payment as a “charitable contribution.” \n\nTrump sued ABC and Stephanopoulos in a Miami federal court in March 2024 after the network aired the segment in which Stephanopoulos repeatedly misstated the verdicts in Carroll’s two civil lawsuits against Trump. Neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.","summary":"President Donald Trump’s contentious relationship with U.S. news organizations over his time in office has led to a host of legal battles and disputes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/donald-trump-jimmy-kimmel-abc-charlie-kirk-npr-b2831661.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/23/00/Trump-Jimmy_Kimmel_58411.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 23:33:39","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":362660040,"title":"Supreme Court Finally Reconsiders Humphrey’s Executor","text":"The Supreme Court Monday announced it would take up a case that gets to the heart of why the deep state exists—it will revisit a precedent that defended the bureaucracy against the executive power vested in the president.\n\nIn Donald Trump v. Rebecca Kelly Slaughter, the Supreme Court blocked a lower court order forcing the president to re-hire a commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission after he had fired her in March.\n\nOn Monday, the Supreme Court announced that it wasn’t just allowing Trump to fire Slaughter until the case is resolved in court, but also that it would fully consider the case.\n\nThe court’s majority directed both parties to argue two central questions: “Whether the statutory removal protections for members of the Federal Trade Commission violate the separation of powers and, if so, whether Humphrey’s Executor v. United States (1935), should be overruled”; and “Whether a federal court may prevent a person’s removal from public office, either through relief at equity or at law.”\n\nSupreme Court Precedent: Humphrey’s Executor\n\nIn Humphrey’s Executor, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution allows Congress to enact laws limiting the power of the president to fire executive officials of an independent agency. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had fired William E. Humphrey, an FTC commissioner, over policy disagreements over economic regulation and the New Deal, even though the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914 prohibited the president from firing a commissioner for any reason other than “inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.”\n\nJustice George Sutherland, who wrote the majority opinion, created a kind of Frankenstein’s monster out of the FTC. He ruled that the FTC was not a traditional executive agency under the Constitution—and thus not subject to the president’s authority under Article II—because it engaged in “quasi-legislative” and “quasi-judicial” functions.\n\n“To the extent that it exercises any executive function—as distinguished from executive power in the constitutional sense—it does so in the discharge and effectuation of its quasi-legislative or quasi-judicial powers, or as an agency of the legislative or judicial departments of the government,” he wrote.\n\nIn other words, it was a defense of the FTC’s constitutionality that it combined the executive, legislative, and judicial functions—even though the Founders explicitly vested these functions in different branches of government to avoid tyranny.\n\nSupreme Court ‘Shadow Docket’ Orders\n\nCritics have long called for the Supreme Court to reverse this ruling, and the court’s previous “shadow docket” orders have suggested that it would indeed rein in the administrative state by doing so. (The “shadow docket” involves the court issuing expedited emergency orders outside its normal term and without the typical opinions explaining the court’s reasoning.)\n\nJustice Elena Kagan dissented from the order, and the other two Democrat-appointed justices—Sonia Sotomayor and Ketanji Brown Jackson—joined her.\n\nKagan noted that the Slaughter case is “the latest in a series.” The Supreme Court had previously issued stays allowing Trump to fire members of the National Labor Relations Board, the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission.\n\nKagan wrote that the court’s “majority, stay order by stay order, has handed full control of all those agencies to the President. He may now remove—so says the majority, though Congress said differently—any member he wishes, for any reason or no reason at all. And he may thereby extinguish the agencies’ bipartisanship and independence.”\n\nThe Supreme Court’s shadow docket rulings did not involve granting the president new power, however. Instead, they meant allowing the president to remove bureaucrats from their jobs while their legal battles continue.\n\nThe Supreme Court’s unsigned order in Trump v. Wilcox grounded a stay on the justices’ “judgment that the government faces greater risk of harm from an order allowing a removed officer to continue exercising the executive power than a wrongfully removed officer faces from being unable to perform her statutory duty.”\n\nWhen the fired bureaucrats file a lawsuit and ask a court to order Trump to rehire them, the courts have to determine first whether to require Trump to rehire them during the case of litigation, and then whether to allow Trump to fire them permanently. The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that the harm to the government of forcing Trump to rehire them in the interim outweighs the harm to the bureaucrat of being unable to fulfill their duties during that same time period.\n\nNow, however, the Supreme Court will take a key step to resolving the underlying issue. By taking up Trump v. Slaughter, the court seems likely to revisit Humphrey’s Executor, and may overturn this precedent. \n\nThis is more than an academic matter. An April poll suggests that as many as 75% of the Washington, D.C.-based bureaucrats who make $75,000 a year or more and who voted for Kamala Harris in November will oppose a lawful Trump order if they consider it bad policy. This suggests deep state opposition to Trump is widespread in the federal government and difficult to root out.\n\nCritics will say overturning this precedent means giving Trump unlimited power, but it would really involve correcting a historic error and putting executive power back into the person whom the American people elect to wield it—the president of the United States.","summary":"The Supreme Court Monday announced it would take up a case that gets to the heart of why the deep state exists—it will revisit a...

Gavin Newsom certainly thinks so, and he is risking an immense amount of political capital in the process. \n\nIndeed, as Newsom sees it, this fight against Trump is existential. Last Tuesday, the governor said that if the ballot measure does not pass, “we’ll lose this republic, we’ll lose this democracy.”\n\nPut another way, as Politico reported, Newsom and California Democrats are relying on “internal polling” which “found that voters are more likely to support the issue if its framed in partisan terms as a pushback to Trump.”\n\nWhatever one feels about redistricting, hyperbolic language about the threat Trump poses to democracy did not work in the 2024 election, so its potential impact now is questionable.\n\nIn many ways, Newsom’s strategy is virtually identical to the playbook Democrats have used, with mixed success, for almost a decade: making every election a referendum on Donald Trump, hoping that is enough to bring out Democrats and sway Independents.\n\nThat is a bold bet for Newsom to make.\n\nYes, Trump is deeply unpopular in California – just 29% of California voters approve of the job he is doing per Berkeley IGS polling – but partisan redistricting is almost as unpopular.\n\nPolling conducted by the Citrin Center/Possibility Lab shows that just 36% of Californians support giving politicians the power to draw districts.\n\nAs such, Newsom’s success is far from guaranteed. Were Prop 50 to fail, even after the massive investment Newsom has made in passing it, it would be a considerable blow to his 2028 presidential ambitions. \n\nTo that end, how the Prop 50 vote goes may provide early insight into the 2026 midterms. \n\nIf, even in deep-blue California, antipathy and anger towards Trump are not enough, then aside from being an embarrassment for Newsom, it’s probable that Republicans will fare better next year.\n\nConversely, if Californians pass Prop 50, Democrats may believe that “stop Trump” is sufficient for their Congressional races.\n\nAll of this being said, the vote will likely end up being more complicated than that. \n\nThere are also deep-pocketed and influential backers of the effort to reject Prop 50. \n\nThis includes former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, who, in a YouGov survey, ranks as the most popular Republican in the country, nearly 20-points ahead of President Trump (55% vs. 37%).\n\nAlso leading opposition groups are former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and Charlie Munger Jr., the son of Warren Buffett’s longtime partner. \n\nImportantly, Schwarzenegger – who publicly backed former VP Kamala Harris and has been a longtime supporter of independent redistricting – gives Republicans a relatively Trump-free, non-partisan shine.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s line of attack – avoiding direct shots at Newsom in favor of arguing that Prop 50 would exacerbate the issue of hyperpolarization in our politics – may prove quite effective. \n\nAll the more so following the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk, which has prompted calls to lower the temperature and extreme partisanship in this country.\n\nTo be sure, California Republicans are keenly aware of the liability that is Donald Trump and are working on putting daylight between the president and this issue, hoping to nullify Newsom’s myopic focus.\n\nState Rep. James Gallgher, who leads the Assembly Republican Caucus said Trump was “wrong” to push for Texas’ redistricting, making the point that California making the second wrong would not make a right. \n\nCritical to both sides of the debate are Hispanic voters.\n\nTrump did well with this group in 2024, both nationally and in California. \n\nAcross the state, Trump increased his vote share in nine of the 12 Latino-majority counties, per analysis from CalMatters.\n\nHowever, heavy-handed immigration tactics have eroded some of those gains. \n\nAccording to polling from the Latino voter group Somos Votantes, Trump’s favorability is 20-points underwater (39% to 59%) among Latino voters.\n\nLooking to capitalize on Latino’s growing disapproval of Trump, the Democratic National Committee recently announced an initiative targeting this crucial bloc of voters. The DNC plans to have 41,000 volunteers going door to door as well as bilingual digital ads.\n\nAt the same time, there are very real questions as to whether dislike of President Trump will be enough by itself to overcome entrenched support for the current redistricting system.\n\nTrying to overcome those concerns, Newsom and liberal influencers held a three hour long telethon, doubling down on their messaging. Throughout, they bashed Trump, and framed California’s efforts as a necessary response to save democracy in the wake of Texas’ own redistricting. \n\nUltimately, state ballot measures rarely become national events, but Prop 50 is certainly one with implications far greater than California.\n\nShould it pass, Newsom will see a considerable boost in his polls, and Democrats will have reason to believe that a “stop Trump” strategy could help them prevail next year.\n\nOr, if it fails – and right now it appears to be a coin-toss – Newsom’s 2028 hopes will take a significant hit, Democrats will be left with no strategy to carry over into 2026, and Trump will again have defeated a Democratic opponent.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Newsom’s strategy is virtually identical to the playbook Democrats have used, with mixed success, for almost a decade.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/22/newsoms-big-bet-is-dislike-of-trump-enough-to-get-proposition-50-through/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/OCR-L-CALAWSUITS-0813.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 22:11:50","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":362648634,"title":"Laura Loomer Calls Rep. Jasmine Crockett A ‘Ghetto Black B—h’ Over Criticism Of Charlie Kirk Resolution","text":"Source: First, let’s be real — at long last — about one thing: the reason white conservatives are working so hard to gaslight the rest of us into believing Charlie Kirk wasn’t a racist is that they agree with Kirk’s opinion of Black people. They want to convince us he wasn’t racist because, in reality, they’re just as racist as he was. Take, for example, this recent tweet by rubber-faced white supremacist and Trump ally Laura Loomer, who called Rep. Jasmine Crockett a “ghetto black b—h” for speaking on the betrayal of white congressional Democrats who voted in favor of a House resolution “honoring the life and legacy” of Kirk, which passed with a 310-58 vote Friday. Loomer reposted a video of Crockett’s recent CNN interview, during which she said it “honestly hurts my heart” that of the 58 Democrats who voted against the resolution, only two were white. “One of the things I do want to point out that’s not been laid out that honestly hurts my heart is when I saw the no votes, there were only two Caucasians,” Crockett said on CNN’s State of the Union Sunday. “For the most part, the only people that voted no were people of color because the rhetoric that Charlie Kirk continuously put out there was rhetoric that specifically targeted people of color.” Loomer responded to Crockett’s interview by turning the Texas congresswoman’s own words against her, and, in doing so, proving she barely scrapes the very low bar for a MAGA racist’s capacity to be clever. “It hurts my heart that we have ghetto black b—–s who hate America serving in Congress,” Loomer tweeted. Now, before I go any deeper into this, let me just say, this isn’t about Laura Loomer. MAGA Barbie has more plastic on her face than actual Barbie — dragging her for being racist against Black women for the umpteenth time is low-hanging fruit I’m only willing to expend so much energy reaching for. This is really about the fact that Loomer’s characterization of Crockett mirrors that of MAGA influencers, radio hosts, and legislators, who have all essentially said as much without using language that is quite as vulgar. Last month, a racist MAGA influencer was dragged out of one of Crockett’s townhalls for calling her a “fake ghetto hoodrat.” Before that, MAGA America collectively called Crockett “ghetto” for calling Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene a “bleached-blonde bad-built butch body,” which she only did because Republican legislators were being dismissive of Greene making inappropriate remarks about Crockett’s personal appearance during a House session. Then, they called Crockett “ghetto” again after she got Rep. Nancy Mace so flustered that Mace threatened physical violence on Crockett, saying they could “take it outside.” Around that same time, Newsmax contributor Todd Starnes said this of Crockett: “Jasmine Crockett wants you to think she’s from the hood – that she grew up on the streets. The exact opposite is true. She attended an exclusive day school where tuition was nearly $35,000 per year. She also attended Rhodes College, a private school where tuition is nearly $55,000 per year. She’s cosplaying a gangsta.” This sentiment was also echoed by Greene during a sit-down with right-wing commentator and logic-challenged racist Megyn Kelly. Here’s what I wrote about what Starnes said at the time: There are few forms of flagrant caucasity that I find more obnoxious than when white people presume to interpret and define Black identity. Even if Crockett had ever claimed that she was from the “hood” or denied she came from an economically privileged background — which she absolutely has not — there’s nothing about her public persona that would indicate she’s trying to perpetrate herself as anything other than the person she is. There’s nothing in the way she speaks. There’s nothing about the way she behaves. There’s nothing about the way she dresses or her eyelashes or her use of strait-talk that reads as “hood”-coded — unless you’re just a racist-a** racist who associated all forms of authentic Blackness with poverty and lack of education. Jasmine Crockett is a Black woman who sounds like a Black woman when she speaks. On her worst day, Crockett doesn’t come anywhere near the vicinity of being as inarticulate as our sitting president, whose baffling misunderstanding of how diction and syntax work is only matched by his misuse of bigly-big vocabulary words like “interpose” and “cyber.” Crockett has never really been inarticulate at all. Sure, she’s light on the code-switching and that Texas drawl of hers be drawling sometimes, but nothing about her reads as “hood” or “gangsta,” and, at any rate, those words are clearly slurs coming out of the mouths of Starnes and his perpetually anti-Black ilk. And that anti-Black ilk includes Loomer, Kirk, Greene, Kelly, and, for damn sure, President Donald Trump. When Charlie Kirk said journalist Joy Reid, former First Lady Michelle Obama, late Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee, and Supreme Court Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson don’t have “the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously, prompting them to steal a white person’s slot,” he sounded no different than Loomer did when she called former VP Kamala Harris, New York AG Letitia James, and Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis “meritless DEI Shaniquas.” (Loomer also called Jackson Lee a “ghetto b—h” right after it was announced that she died of pancreatic cancer.) In both cases, two aggressively mediocre white people whose resumes could fit on a Post-it note are denigrating Black women whose educational and professional accomplishments infinitely outweigh theirs. Meanwhile, the idea that these accomplished Black women are “DEI hires” who are unqualified for their positions they hold has been promoted by MAGA supporters across the interwebs and Republican officials alike. Sure, Loomer’s a raging white supremacist who would be condemned across the bipartisan board if Republicans cared about the dignity of Black women or Black people in general, but they don’t.

His public support for Trump’s proclamation comes a year after he doled out $7 million to a PAC closely aligned with former Vice President Kamala Harris’s failed 2024 presidential campaign. (RELATED: Billionaires Bankrolling Kamala Harris’ Tough-On-Crime Campaign Wanted To Defund Police, Install Soros Prosecutors) \n\n“I’ve worked on H1-B politics for 30 years. Trump’s $100K per year tax is a great solution. It will mean H1-B is used just for very high value jobs, which will mean no lottery needed, and more certainty for those jobs,” Hastings said in an X post Sunday.\n\nHastings and his wife have given over $20 million to the Democratic Party throughout the past few years, cementing the Netflix co-founder as one of the biggest donors to the party. The Netflix executive also gave $1.5 million to former President Joe Biden in 2020 and $100,000 in 2024 — before becoming one of his most influential donors to call for the president to end his reelection bid.\n\nProminent tech leaders and Trump backers, such as Elon Musk — a former H-1B holder himself — and Vivek Ramaswamy, have publicly touted the H-1B program as a legal immigration route to fill gaps in key industries.\n\nRamaswamy notably justified his support of the visa program claiming that America does “not produce the best engineers” in a viral December 2024 post. Musk said in an X post the same month that the “permanent shortage of excellent engineering talent” is a limiting factor in Silicon Valley.\n\nHowever, some prominent conservatives have been critical of the visa. Longtime Trump confidant Steve Bannon blasted “big tech oligarchs” for supporting the H-1B program on his “War Room” podcast in December 2024.\n\nThe H-1B program allows foreign nationals employed in specialty occupations, such as technology and engineering, to enter the U.S. workforce. Over 400,000 people apply for the program — which only has roughly 85,000 spots available — every year.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Discovery merger could give Trump even more influence over US media – shaping the news and culture Americans watch and stream","text":"Following unprecedented threats from Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr, major affiliate station owners Nexstar and Sinclair Broadcasting pressured Disney’s ABC to pull Jimmy Kimmel’s show off the air over his comments related to Charlie Kirk’s killing. \n\nThe suspension is a harbinger of what could happen under a fundamental restructuring of U.S. media that will take place if the proposed Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros. Discovery merger is approved by the Trump administration. \n\nThe deal, first revealed on September 11, 2025, would erase one of the five remaining movie studios and concentrate oversight of two of the country’s most prominent newsrooms – CNN and CBS, both targets of the Trump administration’s ire – under one owner with strong ties to Donald Trump. \n\nBased on research from the Global Media & Internet Concentration Project, our analysis shows that Paramount Skydance-Warner Bros. Discovery would gain control of more than a quarter of the US$223 billion U.S. media market, along with influence over film, television, streaming and the cloud infrastructure upon which digital media increasingly depends. \n\nThe combined entity would acquire nearly half of the cable television market, including HBO and CNN. The merger would nearly double Paramount’s share of the video streaming market, uniting HBO Max, Paramount+ and Discovery. \n\nBy combining two major Hollywood film studios, it would also capture nearly one-third of the film production market.\n\nThis is exactly the type of merger that U.S. antitrust agencies have historically scrutinized because of concerns that excessive market concentration gives too much power to a few companies. \n\nIn media markets, such concerns are pronounced: Concentration threatens media diversity and increases the risk of media bias and ideological manipulation. \n\nA mega-conglomerate like Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery would control a vast share of U.S. viewership. Subject to pressure from or, worse, alignment with the Trump administration, the merged company could promote and protect the administration’s interests. \n\nCloud control\n\nBy combining media production and valuable brands such as Harry Potter, DC Comics and Barbie, the merged giant would gain great negotiating power with competing streaming companies, advertisers and distributors. The merged companies could also secure more lucrative streaming deals, better licensing windows and higher per subscriber and ad rates with cable providers. \n\nThe 2023 Hollywood writers and actors strikes opposed the exploitative impact of streaming and AI on creative workers’ compensation. The new media giant would wield significant bargaining power over those media workers.\n\nThe merger’s potential detrimental impact extends beyond film and television industries. \n\nParamount is helmed by David Ellison, and the merger is backed by his father, Larry Ellison. Ellison senior owns the world’s fifth-largest cloud provider, Oracle. \n\nCloud providers are the critical infrastructure for streaming platforms, ferrying digital content from streamers to viewers. As streaming becomes the dominant mode of media consumption, the Ellison family’s control over this infrastructure could give Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery another lever of power over its competitors. \n\nDiversity denied\n\nWith potential size and reach to rival Disney and Comcast’s NBC Universal, Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery could become another massive media outlet with right-wing ties. \n\nThe proposed deal follows the Trump administration’s $1.1 billion cuts in public media funding. These cuts – affecting PBS, NPR and more than 1,500 affiliated local news stations across the country, all accused by Trump of “partisan bias” – effectively accelerate the ongoing demise of local, independent news. \n\nConcurrently, Rupert Murdoch’s Fox Corp. has settled its dynastic succession, ensuring Fox remains a core channel for the American right. \n\nIf the merger is approved, Fox Corporation, the conservative Sinclair Broadcasting and Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery would control one-third of all U.S. media. \n\nThis consolidation would further cement the partisan media model driving deepening political polarization in the U.S., as public and local news media lose funding. The deal also would undermine already declining media independence, fundamental to holding the powerful – whether corporations or politicians – to account.\n\nWielding regulation\n\nThe Trump administration has not shied away from using antitrust law and communications regulation to exercise political control over media. \n\nBefore initiating its merger with Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount was acquired by David Ellison’s Skydance Media. Ahead of the government’s merger review, amid regulatory signals it could affect the review process, Paramount-owned CBS paid $16.5 million dollars to Donald Trump to settle a lawsuit Trump filed based on allegations of “deceptive” editing of an interview with his political opponent Kamala Harris. Editing of interviews is a standard editorial practice. \n\nShortly after, the merger was approved by the FCC with strict political conditions: hiring an ombudsman to oversee CBS’s reporting and eliminating all of the network’s diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives. \n\nDavid Ellison accepted these conditions, promising to eliminate all of Paramount’s U.S.-based DEI programs. For the ombudsman role, he hired Kenneth Weinstein, former CEO of the conservative Hudson Institute and ambassador to Japan under the first Trump administration.\n\nSince then, the Paramount CEO also has pursued Bari Weiss, a prominent conservative voice, to guide “the editorial direction” of the CBS news division. Ellison’s moves signal that editorial independence at CBS, and soon perhaps CNN, may be subject to ideological oversight.\n\nMeanwhile, Ellison’s father, Larry Ellison, has ties to Donald Trump going back to the first Trump administration. The New York Times in an April 2025 profile said that Ellison “may be closer to Mr. Trump than any mogul this side of” Elon Musk. \n\nThe senior Ellison has been playing a key role in negotiations over the future ownership of TikTok. His ties to Trump run deep enough to likely make him one of the main beneficiaries of the TikTok deal currently in negotiation between the United States and China. \n\nTrump has shown an appetite for coercing media companies. For instance, ABC settled a Trump lawsuit in late 2024 with a $15 million donation to the as-yet-unbuilt Trump Library. \n\nBy placing two major news outlets in the hands of a family with ties to Trump, the Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery merger would facilitate such control. \n\n Read more:\n ABC's and CBS's settlements with Trump are a dangerous step toward the commander in chief becoming the editor-in-chief\n\nWhat Orbán did – but faster\n\nThis is the “Hungarian model” on speed. \n\nViktor Orbán, Hungary’s authoritarian leader, spent a decade asserting increasing control over that nation’s media. \n\nThe Trump administration is poised to accomplish the same in less than a year – and at greater scale. \n\nIn addition to helping allies buy a growing share of U.S. media, in his first eight months Trump also has managed to score conciliatory overtures from the nation’s tech billionaires, who fired fact-checkers at major social media platforms, curbed moderation of hateful content and asserted rigid editorial control over the op-ed pages at The Washington Post, one of the country’s most prominent newspapers. \n\nIf the Paramount-Warner Bros. Discovery merger is approved and Larry Ellison joins Andreessen Horowitz as part of the impending TikTok deal, a movie studio, CBS, CNN, Fox, 185 Sinclair-owned TV stations and a major social media platform will have owners with strong ties to Trump. \n\nWe believe the promised benefits of a Paramount-Warner Bros. Disovery merger, including lower streaming prices, pale next to the damage it would do to media diversity and pluralism. \n\nBy acquiring greater control over film production, TV and streaming, the merger would dramatically reconfigure the very media institutions that shape U.S. culture and politics.\n\nThe Trump administration’s review of this merger may further cement the administration’s political control over the U.S. media.","summary":"The proposed Paramount Skydance and Warner Bros.

The Stairway to the Sky tour marked a return to touring for the singer for the first time since leaving One Direction in March 2015.

His set list is expected to span all four of his albums, including his knockout R&B-fueled debut Mind of Mine, its follow-up Icarus Falls (which contains some of his best work to date, despite its bloated track list), his pandemic record Nobody Is Listening, and his introspective turn to pseudo-country Room Under the Stairs.\n\nGeneral sale for the residency begins Friday, Sept. 26 at 12 p.m. PST. Presale will launch on Wednesday, Sept. 24 at 12 p.m. PST.\n\n“That’s a wrap for my first ever solo tour across the UK & US,” Zayn wrote on Instagram in February. “To every single zquad, my friends and family, to my whole team… Thank you for believing in me, being patient, and for the unwavering amount of love and support you’ve given me throughout the years.

His fledgling nonprofit, Leaving MAGA, was born in 2024 and he says demand is exploding. “We’ve never been busier,” Logis tells followers in regular updates, as he juggles support groups, media hits, and a steady stream of DMs from people quietly looking for the door.\n\nMillions first met Logis last summer on the Democratic National Convention’s big screens in Chicago, where the former MAGA podcaster confessed his years backing Donald Trump were a “grave mistake.” He urged Republicans to cross the aisle for Kamala Harris and later signed on with “Republicans for Harris” in Florida, a jaw-dropper for those who remember him as a marquee MAGA hype man.

Founded by Rich Logis 🇺🇸 (@LeavingMAGA) April 5, 2025\n\nSo what flipped the switch? Logis says it wasn’t one thing, but a slow burn, COVID handling, “Stop the Steal,” and the Jan. 6 attack, followed by what he calls a constant cycle of “chaos.” He describes the movement as a community that can eclipse your real life, where outsiders feel like enemies and dissenting facts get shut out. That’s the core of his pitch now, break the information silo, diversify your sources, and you might be shocked what changes. He repeats that message on podcasts, YouTube appearances, and social posts designed to reach skeptics where they are.\n\nLeaving MAGA isn’t just a slogan, it’s a registered nonprofit with both 501(c)(3) and 501(c)(4) arms, complete with public financials and IRS IDs listed on its site. Early filings show a shoestring operation, a handful of program expenses, modest net assets, and part-time leadership, that nonetheless punches above its weight online. For a group built to help people change their minds, and their social circles, agility may be the point.\n\nI finally stepped out of the MAGA echo chamber, and I realized Trump had been lying about pretty much everything.\n– Rich Logis, former Trump supporter, speaking to the Democratic National Convention pic.twitter.com/8Jr46Jn61y\n— Keith Boykin (@keithboykin) August 19, 2024\n\nThe playbook is part support group, part deprogramming 101. Logis hosts virtual sessions, posts testimonials from ex-MAGA voters, and publishes “how to talk to your MAGA loved one” guides that stress empathy over dunks. He’s also blunt about the cost of leaving, lost friends, fractured families, awkward holidays. The bet is that meeting people with empathy, not shame, can pry open a conversation, especially for those who feel politically ‘homeless.’\n\nIs there really a constituency for this? Judging by the inbox, yes. Logis says he hears from 2024 Trump voters who are now rethinking everything, along with spouses and adult kids asking how to reach the true believers at the dinner table. Some show up voluntarily, others are recruited after arguing with him online and then sliding into DMs for a private chat. It’s not glamorous work, but the supply is endless in a country where politics has morphed into identity.\n\nHis critics call it grift or therapy cosplay. But the counterpoint is simple, if people want a way out, someone has to hold the door. With Washington locked in trench warfare and right-wing media still humming, “de-radicalization” has become a cottage industry. Leaving MAGA is one of the tiny outfits trying to make that abstract idea operational, one Zoom, one skeptical text thread, one awkward coffee at a time. And if Logis is right about the demand spike, he’ll be wearing that Leaving MAGA cap for a while.","summary":"Rich Logis is on a mission to help Trump supporters break free and his Leaving MAGA movement is gaining momentum fast.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/never-been-busier-former-trumper-helping-people-escape-maga-is-growing-fast","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Leaving-Maga-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 17:34:03","author":"Frank Yemi,Rich Logis","authors":["Frank Yemi","Rich Logis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.134},{"id":362633102,"title":"Kamala’s Memoir Is So Bad, It’s Hard To Believe She Read It","text":"The reviews are in for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ memoir, “107 Days.” The book is bad on its own merits. And worse for what’s left of Harris’ reputation. \n\nFirst, an unforgivably tardy critique of former President Joe Biden’s decision to stay in the presidential race. Harris never managed to artfully separate from Biden after she took his place as Democratic nominee. \n\n“‘It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized,” Harris writes, according to a screenshot. “Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision.” (RELATED: Kamala Harris Is Still In Complete Denial)\n\n Kamala Harris opens her book 107 Days with a quote from Kendrick Lamar’s “DNA”: “I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA” pic.twitter.com/sIBdBiq59d — XXL Magazine (@XXL) September 22, 2025\n\nAn honest Democrat strategist might say the same of Harris’ decision to run in Biden’s stead. \n\nBut Harris isn’t done complaining. \n\n“I shouldered the blame for the porous border, an issue that had proved intractable for Democratic and Republican administrations alike,” Harris whines. Note: President Donald Trump’s second administration has proved the issue is more than tractable. \n\nHarris spins securing the border as an utter impossibility. \n\n“No one around the president advocated, Give her something she can win with.”\n\nWhat would that be? Third grade math? Slurring her words during interviews?\n\nHarris claims she was “castigated for, apparently, delivering [a speech] too well.” \n\nThe Biden White House’s “thinking was zero-sum: If she’s shining, he’s dimmed. None of them grasped that if I did well, he did well. That given the concerns about his age, my visible success as his vice president was vital. It would serve as a testament to his judgment in choosing me and reassurance that if something happened, the country was in good hands. My success was important for him.” \n\nIf Harris managed to speak with half the lucidity she mustered for this book, she might’ve had different presidential odds. \n\nInstead, Harris blames “a series of mistakes, committed over years, mostly by other people,” according to a review of the memoir from Semafor. \n\n“I didn’t have enough time,” she writes, according to The New York Times (NYT). \n\n Of course Kamala Harris is gonna blame everyone except herself for losing in her new book, but the complete trashing of the Joe Biden comms team is incredible… “I often learned that the president’s staff was adding fuel to negative narratives that sprang up around me.” “when… pic.twitter.com/qvv8K2KMQ6 — Nathan Brand (@NathanBrandWA) September 10, 2025\n\nShe blames the American public for being too old-fashioned to accept Pete Buttigieg as her running mate, saying, “[Pete] would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man.”\n\n“But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a black woman, a black woman married to a jewish man. Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let’s just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.”\n\nHarris’ losing attitude is summed up in one anecdote from the book. Harris gave an interview to Doctor Mike, a YouTube channel with over 14 million subscribers. \n\n“When Doctor Mike asked, ‘Are you getting your seven to nine hours of sleep these days?’ I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,” Harris writes, according to photos posted by reporter Alex Thompson. \n\nAfter bombing the interview, she laced into her senior staffers, asking them, “What the fuck was that?” Emphasis hers.\n\n“Brian … launched into a detailed explanation about the rationale behind doing the podcast. I raised my hand and stopped him midsentence.”\n\n“‘Brian,’ I said through gritted teeth, ‘that was a rhetorical question.’ Unbeknownst to me, for the next few days, any time any of those team members asked each other anything at all, ‘That was a rhetorical question’ would be the lighthearted response.” \n\n We very seriously need to consider the possibility that Kamala Harris’ ghost writer hates her https://t.co/i6vkszKmTg — PoIiMath (@politicalmath) September 20, 2025\n\nThere are a few takeaways from this debacle, none flattering, none obvious to Harris (apparently). \n\nHarris buckles under the pressure of a slower-than-slow-pitch question.

This looks like the most competitive race, certainly of one of magnitude in the country,\" Daniel Bowen, a political science professor at The College of New Jersey, told ABC News.\n\nOn the Republican ticket, former state Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli is making a third try for the office and hopes to flip the state's governorship currently held by Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy, who cannot run for a third consecutive term. On the Democratic ticket is U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, who beat out a crowded primary field in June and now looks to keep New Jersey's governorship blue.\n\n\"I understand why people say there's national implications here. There's only two governor races in the entire country this year,\" Ciatterelli told ABC News in a recent interview.\n\n\"But this is all about New Jersey's future and that's where I keep my focus. My only concern is fixing New Jersey … as I go around the state, that's exactly what people want to hear. That's exactly what people want.\"\n\nSherrill, in a statement to ABC News, brought up her campaign aims of helping with affordability and accountability, while also framing the race as having national stakes.\n\n\"New Jerseyans know what's at stake in this election, and we know that the nation is watching,\" Sherrill said. \"We can choose to elect a Trump lackey who is going to do whatever the President says, and make New Jerseyans foot the bill, or we can chart a different path forward… by delivering for working families, we're laying the groundwork for Democrats in 2026 and beyond.\"\n\nThe race could measure how voters are looking for change, Bowen told ABC News, given that \"a fact of politics in 2025 is this distrust of politicians, distrust of those in power, dissatisfaction with where things are, and that could advantage an opposition candidate,\" which could help Republicans in the state campaigning against New Jersey's currently Democratic-controlled government.\n\nBut at the same time, Bowen added, \"if you think of trying to react against the way things are going right now, who is determining the way things are going? Well, that's largely being set by the federal government and the Trump administration. So your response isn't necessarily to the state government. It's probably more likely going to be the response to the federal government.\"\n\nThe question of who voters are seeing as the \"incumbent\" played out during Sunday night's gubernatorial debate, one of two where Ciattarelli and Sherrill are facing off. Sherrill, for instance, occasionally brought up Trump, and at one point criticized Ciatterelli's praise of parts of the president's signature tax and policy bill.\n\n\"I'm sure he would like you to focus on those four things, because he doesn't want you to focus on his tariff plan, which is putting small businesses out of business … In every single way, we're seeing costs go up on New Jersey families and Jack just says he has nothing he disagrees with Donald Trump on,\" she said.\n\nBut Ciattarelli later tied Sherrill to incumbent Gov. Phil Murphy and the current Democratic control of the state, which he framed as causing disillusionment and challenges for New Jerseyans.\n\n\"Their party's been in control [of the state legislature] for 25 years, and they've had the executive branch for eight years. But you don't hear her, you don't hear my opponent criticizing the current [New Jersey] administration, or the 25 year reign of the Democrats,\" he said.\n\nSimilar to other high-profile races in 2025, millions have been spent already on advertising and campaigning, including by national groups such as the Democratic National Committee and Republican Governors Association.\n\nThe governor's race in New Jersey is projected to see $140 million in ad spending, an expected 268% increase over spending in the state's 2021 gubernatorial race, according to media tracking agency AdImpact. The agency has also tracked millions more spending in support of Sherrill than of Ciatterelli as of mid-September.\n\nThose ads are playing for unaffiliated voters as well, which number over 2 million in New Jersey.\n\n\"The independent vote is really a material part of New Jersey's political history ... the fact that New Jersey has gone, and the governor's mansion, from red to blue to red to blue,\" Keith Norman, vice president for political practice at LG Ad Solutions, told ABC News. \"It's a state that doesn't typically see one party holding the office consistently.\"\n\nRepublicans point to 2024 as a sign they can flip the governorship. Democratic candidate Kamala Harris won New Jersey by around 6 percentage points in 2024, even though Joe Biden won the state by about 16 percentage points in 2020.\n\nThe campaigns are also working to reach the large number of voters around the state who don't have traditional over-the-air TV or cable, and can target New Jerseyans using streaming platforms and internet-connected TV more precisely.\n\nOff the airwaves, meanwhile, both sides are running large ground games to turn out the vote.\n\nKate Gibbs, the executive director of the New Jersey Republican Party, told ABC News that the party aims to knock on 1.2 million doors, is working with every local GOP organization, and is trying to narrow the gap between New Jersey's registered Democratic and Republican voters.\n\nAs of the beginning of September, there were over 860,000 more registered Democrats in New Jersey than Republicans, according to data from the New Jersey Department of State.)\n\nAnd Gibbs says the party feels voters are anti-incumbent towards the current governor: \"What we're hearing overwhelmingly is that people think the state's on the wrong track and that they want change.\"\n\nThe Sherrill campaign, meanwhile, says it has contacted over 1.7 million voters since the primary, knocked on almost 150,000 doors, and gotten donations from all 21 counties.","summary":"In New Jersey’s 2025 election for governor, the candidates are grappling with if the race is a bellwether for how voters feel about President Donald Trump.","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/nj-governors-race-ciattarelli-sherrill-grapple-bellwether-trump/story?id=125812475","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1b14bebc-149b-4fd9-9065-ca4428a42e17/nj-gov-debate-1-ap-gmh-250922_1758547296448_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 16:51:00","author":"Oren Oppenheim","authors":["Oren Oppenheim"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.084},{"id":362569804,"title":"CBS releases Trump-free preview of ‘60 Minutes’ fall season after $16M lawsuit settlement","text":"CBS on Sunday released a trailer for “60 Minutes” that is notably devoid of any mention of President Trump – after coughing up $16 million this year to settle claims of election interference.\n\nThe trailer for season 58 of the network’s infamous newsmagazine runs two minutes and 50 seconds long and covers Charlie Kirk’s shocking assassination last week, developments in artificial intelligence and even bird-watching – but no mention of Trump.\n\nMeanwhile, its season 57 trailer, which was released on Sep. 10, 2024, runs for two minutes and 30 seconds and includes a 10-second feature on the Jan. 6 attacks on the Capitol and an interview with a Trump supporter who believed the 2020 election was rigged.\n\nThe Trump-free trailer comes after Paramount Global and CBS in July agreed to pay $16 million to settle claims that a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris was deceitfully edited to make her appear more articulate ahead of the 2024 election. \n\nTrump later said he expected to receive a total of $36 million, confirming an exclusive report by The Post. That includes $20 million in advertising and public service announcements from Skydance Media, which took control of Paramount later in July.\n\nSkydance is led by David Ellison, the son of billionaire Trump ally and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison.\n\nRepresentatives for CBS, Paramount and “60 Minutes” did not immediately respond to The Post’s requests for comment.\n\nCBS staffers were furious with Shari Redstone, then-Paramount’s controlling shareholder, over the settlement, which they viewed as a capitulation to pressure from the Trump administration. \n\nAt the time, Paramount was still hoping to gain approval from Trump’s FCC for its long-planned merger with Skydance.\n\nAlso in July, CBS canceled Stephen Colbert’s late-night show, calling it a “financial decision,” though there has been speculation that Colbert’s anti-Trump politics played a role.\n\nMeanwhile, ABC this week suspended Jimmy Kimmel “indefinitely” after he said right-wingers were politicizing Kirk’s assassination – and seemingly implied that the killer might have been a MAGA conservative.\n\nJust a few hours before ABC announced Kimmel’s suspension, Carr had suggested there was a “strong case” for the FCC to take action against ABC and its parent company, Disney.\n\n“We can do this the easy way or the hard way,” Carr said during a podcast with Benny Johnson, a right-wing pundit and YouTuber.\n\nSinclair and Nexstar – two major owners of ABC affiliate stations – quickly yanked Kimmel’s show off the air.\n\nNexstar, which owns 32 ABC affiliates, is currently seeking FCC approval to acquire rival Tegna and its 13 ABC stations. \n\nThe deal is also likely dependent on a rule change from Carr to the nationwide cap on the percentage of households a single entity’s TV stations are permitted to reach.\n\nThe cap is currently set at 39%. Nexstar’s deal with Tegna is expected to greatly exceed that limit.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has cheered Kimmel’s ouster and added that the US government might start revoking broadcast licenses from networks that are mostly “against” him.\n\nHe said that ultimately the decision “will be up to Brendan Carr,” who earlier called Kimmel’s comments “truly sick.”\n\nDuring his show’s opening monologue on Monday, Kimmel said: “We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.”\n\nCarr on Thursday denied that his calls for ABC to take action against Kimmel were linked to the late-night comedian’s anti-Trump politics.\n\nHe argued that networks with TV licenses – like ABC, NBC and CBS – have an obligation to serve the public interest, and Kimmel failed to do so by “appearing to directly mislead the American public.”\n\nThe day after Kimmel’s monologue, court documents were filed that showed that the mother of Tyler Robinson – the accused killer – told investigators that “her son had become more political and had started to lean more to the left.”","summary":"The trailer covers Charlie Kirk’s shocking assassination last week, developments in artificial intelligence and even bird-watching – but no mention of Trump.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/22/media/cbs-releases-trump-free-preview-of-60-minutes-fall-season-after-16m-lawsuit-settlement/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/111929426.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/VMX54lIz-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-22 16:35:38","author":"Taylor Herzlich","authors":["Taylor Herzlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.43},{"id":362560188,"title":"Warren reveals Democratic heavyweights warned her not to say economy was 'rigged' in 2012 DNC speech","text":"Sen.

Now, ultimately, I got to leave it in. It was my speech, and they let me leave it in. And I’m grateful for that. But four years later, when Donald Trump ran, he talked about ‘rigged’ every day,\" she said. She mentioned how Trump made this approach effective during his 2024 campaign. \"He kept saying ‘on Day 1.’ In other words, he saw the problem and he said, ‘I get it.

Enten said on “CNN News Central” that Democrats should not be reassured about their chances just because President Donald Trump tends to be “underwater” in his polling, comparing the party’s standing to the 2022 midterms when Republicans took control of the House of Representatives. (RELATED: Democrats Divided Over Whether They Should Keep Calling Trump ‘Wannabe Hitler’ Post Charlie Kirk Assassination)\n\n“Let’s compare it back to 2022. I think this kind of gives away the game right here. The GOP is more trusted than the Dems on the economy. It was 12 points in 2022. Slight, slight decline in that lead but still seven points,” Enten told host Kate Bolduan. “How about immigration? It was Republicans by three back in 2022. Look at this. The Republican lead has actually gone up by 10 points. What are you doing, Democrats? My goodness gracious.”\n\n“And on crime, the Republicans were up by 13 and now they’re up by 22,” he continued. “The lead again expanding by nearly double digits. So whatever Democrats are doing, it ain’t working, Kate. It ain’t working. Republicans have the lead on all three issues.”\n\nBolduan asked Enten what he believed was causing the shift.\n\n“It’s all about the center of the electorate, right? You win with independents, you win overall,” Enten said. “And what do we see right here among independents? Republicans still have a point lead on the economy. They got a 10-point lead on immigration. They got a 21-point lead on crime.”\n\n“The bottom line is when you look at these numbers, Democrats should call their offices because at this particular point, even if the public doesn’t like what Donald Trump is doing, they ain’t necessarily liking what Democrats are doing,” he added. “And it ain’t just a referendum on one party. You actually have to go out and beat that party at this particular point. Democrats are not able to beat Republicans.”\n\nThe Trump administration has achieved four straight months without paroling a single illegal migrant into the country.

Goldberg claimed the show \"took a breath\" to see if Kimmel would publicly address his show's suspension. \"Now, look, did y’all really think we weren’t going to talk about Jimmy Kimmel?\" Goldberg said. \"I mean, have you watched the show over the last 29 seasons? So you know no one silences us, and to all my friends who reached out, you have to know, it’s OK, we’re still here. We’re still broadcasting. And when the news broke last week about Jimmy Kimmel’s suspension, we took a breath to see if Jimmy was going to say anything about it first. We did the same thing with Stephen Colbert.

The outspoken hosts of \"The View\" had been silent last week on Kimmel's suspension, raising eyebrows and even consternation with media observers. During Thursday's episode of \"The View,\" which operates under ABC's news division, the hosts did not discuss the Disney-owned network pulling \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!,\" a story that broke the night before, dominating news coverage and sparking outrage from liberals. The co-hosts typically open the show with their \"Hot Topics\" segments, which include commentary on major headlines. They didn't discuss it on Friday's pre-taped show either. \"I’m friendly with the ladies on ‘The View,' but they didn’t say anything about this, this week. Nothing,\" comedian Bill Maher noted during \"Real Time\" on Friday. \"You know, because it’s never been their thing to weigh in on the issues. It’s just an upbeat party show. That’s why they hired people named Joy [Behar] and Sunny [Hostin] and Whoopi [Goldberg],\" he quipped. MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace, who was previously a co-host on \"The View,\" also noted the silence from the show. \"And it was visible. I was on ‘The View.’ Those women are fearless, and the story didn’t come up. I mean, it’s obviously being felt and acted upon at ABC more broadly,\" Wallace said last week. Fox News Digital had learned that the show could address the Kimmel situation this week if there were new developments. The co-hosts are set to interview former Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday about her new book, \"107 Days.\" On social media, \"The View\" fans expressed anger at their conspicuous silence on Kimmel. \"I had a bad feeling they were not going to speak about Kimmel. I am so disappointed,\" one user commented on a YouTube video of one of their segments last week, according to The Daily Beast. FCC CHAIR LEVELS THREAT AGAINST ABC, DISNEY AFTER KIMMEL SUGGESTED CHARLIE KIRK ASSASSIN WAS ‘MAGA’ Kimmel's show was pulled after the liberal late-night host suggested Charlie Kirk's alleged shooter was part of the \"MAGA gang,\" sparking criticism from the FCC and leading two major ABC affiliate owners to yank the program. Kimmel reportedly did not want to apologize for his comments, which he felt were misinterpreted. He planned to defend his remarks and attack his critics on Wednesday night's episode before Disney elected to pull the show. Maher expressed empathy for Kimmel on Friday. \"It was 24 years to the day that I made comments on ABC that got me canceled from that network, and Jimmy Kimmel took my slot,\" Maher said during his opening monologue. \"Oh, yes, I got canceled before cancel even had a culture,\" he quipped.

Enten, on “CNN News Central,” noted that Independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders lagged significantly more against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2014. (RELATED: Democrats Divided Over Whether They Should Keep Calling Trump ‘Wannabe Hitler’ Post Charlie Kirk Assassination)\n\n“I just think it’s just such a tectonic shift within the Democratic electorate. Early choices for the Dem presidential nominee — back in June of 2014: look, Hillary Clinton was way ahead of everybody with 69%. Bernie Sanders was like in ninth or tenth place with just 2%,” Enten said. “Look at where we are right now in September of 2025. Look how much closer AOC is to the top now than Bernie Sanders was back a decade ago. She’s at 12%, so she has six times his amount of support.”\n\n“But more than that, look how much closer she is to the leader. Gavin Newsom leads the field right now, but just with 21%. She is within ten points of Gavin Newsom,” he added. “I never thought I would have seen the day when someone as liberal as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is is to the leader … If we thought Bernie Sanders was a long shot back in June of 2014, at this particular point, AOC has a very real shot, at least according to the early numbers that we see so far.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez is a Democratic Socialist and one of the authors of the “Green New Deal,” a multi-trillion dollar proposal to push the U.S. toward net-zero emissions and guarantee jobs in the process. She has also participated in fellow Sanders‘ “Fighting Oligarchy” tour, which launched in February.\n\nMoreover, when asked to identify the Democratic leader they believe “best reflects the core values” of their party, 10% of Democrats selected Ocasio-Cortez, while 8% chose Sanders, according to a CNN/SSRS poll published March 16. Ocasio-Cortez ranked first, while Sanders ranked third, with former Vice President Kamala Harris in between them at 9%.\n\nHarris also ranked second in the Yahoo/YouGov poll between Ocasio-Cortez and Newsom at 19%.\n\nFurthermore, only 42% of Democrats said they held a positive view of capitalism, compared to 66% who had a positive view of socialism, Gallup found in a poll published on Sept. 8.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

You get rid of the filibuster, and you've lost all civility, what little bit we have left, we've lost it all in the political arena, especially in the Senate.

Or that it was the Republicans that did the nuclear option that made it possible for Supreme Court justices to be confirmed by a simple majority?

[2] At that point, protection ceased immediately upon leaving office, as was the standard practice until the events of the 2000 Presidential election and terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 changed that.\n\nHow 9/11 reshaped Secret Service protection for vice presidents\n\nAll Secret Service protection is threat based [3] and Vice Presidents traditionally had a lower threat portfolio than the President. They were often more low profile and didn’t engender the same level of media coverage while in office.\n\nThe tumult of the 2000 election changed that and fed an enhanced threat narrative that impacted both candidates. Former VP Al Gore and former President George Bush both were vilified for the election outcome by almost half of America.\n\nPresident-elect Bush, once in office, recognized this and extended Secret Service protection for former VP Gore and his wife at the time, Tipper Gore, via Executive Order for an additional six months. [4] Historically, this was the first time that protection was extended to a former Vice President leaving office.\n\nThen on September 11, 2001, the terrorist attack against the United States rapidly changed the threat dynamic in the world as Secret Service personnel evacuated President Bush in Florida, relocated VP Cheney to the White House bunker, enacted our nation’s contingency government operations plan and in New York City, responded to the attack that impacted their building at 7 World Trade Center and caused the death of Master Special Officer Craig Miller. Overnight, Secret Service protection increased, with protectees expanding from 18 to 29. [5]\n\nVice President Cheney and the rise of post-9/11 threats\n\nVP Cheney and his entire family were already traditional protectees. While in office, he and President Bush were the targets of repeated death threats from Osama bin Laden, al Qaeda and other terrorist groups. Many security experts believe that Flight 77, which struck the Pentagon, or Flight 93, which passengers forced down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, may have been intended for the White House and President Bush. [6]\n\nThrough the eight years of the Bush presidency, which included the war on terror and wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, those threats never ceased and only escalated. This allowed policymakers, including members of Congress, time to think, as they realized that the day Vice President Cheney left office — a Vice President with verified terrorist threats against him — he would lose Secret Service protection.\n\nFormer VP Cheney, who was high on the terrorist target list, had an initial Presidential-approved six months of protection which was extended, upon his request, to an additional six months due to the threats. [7] Once the year ended, his Secret Service protection did as well and Cheney hired his own private security.\n\nModern debates over protection for former vice presidents\n\nIn 2008 Congress then passed the “Former Vice President Protection Act of 2008,” which authorized Secret Service protection for former Vice Presidents, their spouses and their children less than 16 years of age for up to six months after the Vice President’s term in office has ended. [1]\n\nOf course, the law did not stop the President from being able to authorize Secret Service protection by Executive Order which occurred for former VP Harris. Former President Biden’s Executive Order extended her protection to 18 months, well beyond the statutory six months. [8]\n\nPresident Trump rescinded that protection, which according to the Secret Service was due to “a recent threat intelligence assessment … found no red flags or credible evidence of a threat to the former vice president.” [9]\n\nMore than two decades after the September 11 attacks, the world remains unpredictable and dangerous. As threat landscapes evolve, it is critical that federal protection decisions remain grounded in intelligence and mission priorities with the Secret Service focused on its statutory missions. When federal agencies are stretched too thin, everyone’s security suffers.\n\nHow can agencies best balance limited resources with evolving threat landscapes? Share below.\n\nU.S. Congress.

The day after Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump, for example, Representative Seth Moulton of Massachusetts told The New York Times, “I have two little girls, I don’t want them getting run over on a playing field by a male or formerly male athlete, but as a Democrat I’m supposed to be afraid to say that.” In that moment, the floodgates seemed poised to open. Moulton’s perspective, though taboo among much of the party’s activist base, placed him firmly in the American mainstream. Surely more Democrats would start coming out of the woodwork to advertise their moderate cultural views, and the idea of a radical Democratic Party would begin to fade away.\n\nIn fact, in the ensuing 10 months, the floodgates have mostly stayed closed. With a few exceptions—notably California Governor Gavin Newsom and, less notably, former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who hasn’t won an election since 2015—Democrats have avoided making comments similar to Moulton’s, whether regarding trans athletes or other high-profile social issues on which the party is vulnerable, such as immigration and climate.\n\nThis is a sign of a strange dynamic that has emerged in Democratic politics. Many pundits, strategists, and even elected officials recognize that the party has weakened itself by being out of touch, or at least perceived to be out of touch, on cultural issues. As Representative Ritchie Torres of New York told Time in May, “We swung the pendulum too far to the left.” But for the most part, the very same Democrats making that argument haven’t followed it to its natural conclusion by moving significantly rightward on any major issue. Even Torres’s big postelection immigration “flip-flop,” as Politico put it, was to announce that he would no longer fight against the deportation of undocumented immigrants who have a criminal record.\n\nCountless Democrats are barnstorming the country and the media, stressing the need to broaden their party’s appeal and reach voters where they are. But they have yet to prove that they’re willing to do what it takes.\n\nSeemingly every other week, another Democrat gives a podcast interview or writes an op-ed about how the party must win back the working-class voters it has alienated. “If you are setting a table that people with mud on their boots and grease on their jeans do not feel comfortable at,” Representative Kristen Rivet of Michigan told me in July, “you are walking away from the Democratic agenda.” But if you pay close attention to what these politicians say, you will struggle to find much evidence of them trying to stake out positions that might bring some of those blue-collar voters back into the fold.\n\nThe platonic ideal of political moderation works something like this: Pick a high-profile issue on which your party is perceived as out of touch with public opinion. Signal publicly that you agree with most voters on the issue, and that you disagree with the members of your own base who think otherwise. “You’ve got to go against your party,” Elaine Kamarck, a Brookings fellow who was a prominent centrist New Democrat during the 1990s, told me. Creating conflict demonstrates your independence and draws media attention, without which voters might never know about your position. The gambit is not without risk—you’re purposely angering some of your own supporters—but it hopefully pays off because you gain new supporters, and most of your angry existing supporters will still vote for you.\n\nThe canonical example was executed by Bill Clinton. In 1992, while running to become the first Democratic president in 12 years, he spoke to Jesse Jackson’s social-justice activist group, the Rainbow Coalition. The night before his speech, the group had hosted the rapper and activist Sister Souljah, who had recently caused a stir by saying, about the Rodney King riots, “If Black people kill Black people every day, why not have a week and kill white people?” Clinton used his own appearance to condemn Sister Souljah’s comments. His speech infuriated Jackson and many other left-wing activists, who felt that Clinton had taken her comments out of context. The back-and-forth became a major news story. Of course, this was the plan. “If nobody gets mad, you’re not doing anything courageous,”Kamarck, who worked in the Clinton White House, told me.\n\nTrump is no moderate, but in 2016 and 2024, he used selective moderation to make inroads with swing voters who disapprove of certain unpopular Republican Party orthodoxies. In his first run for president, he committed to not cutting Social Security and Medicare, and he hammered his primary opponents for supporting the invasion of Iraq. In his 2024 run, he promised not to enact a national abortion ban. All three of these positions were broadly popular but offended core Republican constituencies—budget hawks, neoconservatives, and pro-lifers, respectively. They seem to have paid off.\n\nThe Democrats who complain most loudly about the need to fix the party’s brand aren’t trying anything this ambitious. Their efforts to appeal to moderates and conservatives tend to be uncontroversial, which might defeat the purpose. One recent Washington Post article compiled various recent “Sister Souljah moments” from Democratic politicians. It included, as a lead example, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro boasting that he’d legalized hunting on Sundays. No core constituency in the Democratic Party is outraged by the thought of hunting on Sundays, which is why you almost certainly heard nothing about Shapiro’s comment.\n\nNewsom might be the most high-profile exception to the trend. In apparent preparation for a presidential run, the governor has taken public steps to shed his image as a doctrinaire California progressive. In March, he launched a podcast featuring conversations with conservatives. His very first guest was Charlie Kirk. During that episode, Newsom declared that allowing trans girls to compete in girls’ sports was “deeply unfair.” A few weeks later, he repeated the sentiment to Bill Maher. And in May, he proposed freezing enrollment of undocumented immigrants into California’s Medicaid program—a very modest break with the left that nonetheless angered immigration activists in the state. Newsom’s approach, along with his outspoken opposition to Trump, is raising his profile: In recent weeks, he has appeared at the top of some 2028 presidential-primary polls.\n\nBy and large, however, even the elected Democrats most insistent on the need for change seem focused on adjustments to the party’s communication style, rather than to its substantive positions. One school of thought holds that Democrats can woo cross-pressured voters without having to compromise on policy at all, as long as they switch up their vocabulary. Last month, the centrist group Third Way published a list of jargon that it would like Democrats to stop using. The list included the genuinely ubiquitous—privilege, existential threat, unhoused—along with more obscure academese, such as minoritized communities, chest feeding, and person who immigrated.\n\nThe memo hardly made a splash, because its point of view had already become conventional wisdom: fewer academic buzzwords, more folksy language. Be less “preachy,” as Pete Buttigieg put it in July. No more “advocacy-speak,” per Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear. Demonstrate your “alpha energy,” as Elissa Slotkin says frequently. Slotkin bragged in May to The Washington Post about a speech that she’d given to some Teamsters ahead of the election: “I just said, ‘Hey, you motherfuckers, I don’t want to hear another goddamn word about all Donald Trump has done for you.’ They love it.”\n\nA related theory of rhetorical moderation is about emphasis, not word choice. Because Democrats are much closer to the median voter on bread-and-butter material issues than Republicans are, perhaps they just need to talk more about their popular economic ideas and less about their unpopular social-issue positions. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut recently articulated a version of this argument to my colleague Gilad Edelman. “Climate, guns, choice, gay rights, voting rights: Every single one of those issues is existential for an important community,” he said. “But I think right now, if you aren’t driving the vast majority of your narrative around the way in which the economy is going to become corrupted to enrich the elites, then you aren’t going to be able to capture this potential realignment of the American electorate that’s up for grabs.” Representative Tom Suozzi of New York is a rare Democratic moderate on immigration. So I was surprised that, when I asked him whether his colleagues needed to change any of their cultural positions, he said, “No. We’ve got to focus more. We have to lay out clearly what the platform is, what the emphasis is.”\n\nBoth ideas—talk like a normal person, and shut up about social issues—have some merit. But because working-class voters already think Democratic politicians hold radical left-wing cultural views, tactical silence seems unlikely to dislodge that belief.\n\nWhy didn’t more Democrats follow Seth Moulton’s lead after the election? The answer might lie in what happened to him after his comments about trans athletes. In the weeks that followed, his campaign manager resigned, protesters swarmed his district office, and the chair of the local Democratic committee in Salem, Massachusetts (where Moulton was born and resides), referred to him in an email as a “Nazi cooperator.” The committee promised to find a primary challenger. Over the summer, the threat came true: Moulton will defend himself in a primary for the first time since 2020. (His opponent, Bethany Andres-Beck, is trans and uses “any/all pronouns.”)\n\nMoulton told me that “fear of backlash” is what prevents Democrats from adjusting their publicly held cultural commitments. He estimates that more than half of his Democratic colleagues in the House, possibly many more, privately agree with him that girls’ sports should be limited to cisgender girls. After Moulton wrote a Washington Post op-ed warning against “Democratic purity tests,” he said, scores of colleagues approached him in the halls of Congress to thank him. But, he told me, they did so in a whisper. “Thank you for saying that, because I really can’t,” they’d say.\n\nThis silence is a result of the primary system. Because the overwhelming majority of elected Democrats at the federal level are in safe seats, they’re more likely to lose to a primary challenger from their left than to a Republican in the general. Everyone knows what must be done to improve the party’s image, but each individual actor’s incentive is to do nothing—or, if not do nothing, then settle for rhetorical adjustments without taking any controversial positions.\n\nThat strategy might be enough for Democrats to win the House next year. A recent New York Times analysis found that, even if Republicans succeed in their most ambitious gerrymandering plans, Democrats could expect to take the House back by winning the national vote by 3.4 points. In 2018, during Trump’s first term, they won by about seven (excluding uncontested races).\n\nBut the Senate is a far more difficult prospect for Democrats. To take back the upper chamber in 2026, Democrats must not only beat Susan Collins in Maine, but win five races in states that Trump won last year, including two that he carried by more than 10 percentage points. The idea that they can do so without fielding candidates who are willing to publicly renounce some left-wing orthodoxies is delusional. Nor is this a quirk of the 2026 cycle. By design, the Senate favors less-populous states, which today are disproportionately rural and white. Democrats might never control the Senate again if they don’t return to being competitive in such states. That would mean never stopping the confirmation of a Republican official or judge, and never being able to confirm their own without Republican votes.\n\nDemocratic recruiters could respond to that fact by looking for the kind of culturally conservative Senate candidates that rural voters used to approve of, but there’s little sign of that happening. In Maine, national Democrats have been trying to recruit 77-year-old Governor Janet Mills, most famous for refusing to go along with a Trump executive order to ban trans women from women’s sports. In North Carolina, Iowa, Ohio, Texas, Alaska, and Florida—of which Democrats must win at least three to take the Senate—the leading candidates mostly appear to have standard Democratic cultural views; two are Democrats who lost Senate races last year and haven’t publicly changed any of their positions on high-profile social issues since.\n\nFor Democrats to appeal to cultural conservatives, some of them probably have to actually be more culturally conservative than what the party has offered in recent years, and not just adopt a different affect or ignore social issues entirely. Or they could simply cross their fingers and hope voters spontaneously adopt new perceptions about the party. That strategy offends no one and incurs little risk. That’s why it’s unlikely to work.","summary":"Party leaders know they need to moderate on cultural issues to win back working-class voters—so why don’t they?","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/democrats-moderation-working-class/684264/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/wmgziaAGSZhNGcO9WWDSqzLd-SE=/0x0:1920x1080/720x405/media/img/mt/2025/09/final/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 11:00:00","author":"Marc Novicoff","authors":["Marc Novicoff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":362523168,"title":"I Thought I Knew Silicon Valley. I Was Wrong","text":"But in January, Lemley made a radical move. “I have struggled with how to respond to Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook’s descent into toxic masculinity and Neo-Nazi madness,” he posted on LinkedIn. “I have fired Meta as a client.”\nThis is the Silicon Valley of 2025. Zuckerberg, now 41, had turned into a MAGA-friendly mixed martial arts fan who didn’t worry so much about hate speech on his platforms and complained that corporate America wasn’t masculine enough. He stopped fact-checking and started hanging out at Mar-a-Lago. And it wasn’t only Zuckerberg. A whole cohort of billionaires seemed to place their companies’ fortunes over the well-being of society.\nWhen I meet Lemley at his office at Stanford this July, he is looking vacation-ready in a Hawaiian shirt. In the half year since he fired Meta, very few powerful people have followed his lead. Privately, they tell him, you go! Publicly, they’re gone. Lemley has even considered how he might be gone if things get bad for anti-Trumpers. “Everybody I’ve talked to has a potential exit strategy,” he says. “Could I get citizenship here or there?”\nIt should be the best of times for the tech world, supercharged by a boom in artificial intelligence. But a shadow has fallen over Silicon Valley. The community still overwhelmingly leans left. But with few exceptions, its leaders are responding to Donald Trump by either keeping quiet or actively courting the government. One indelible image of this capture is from Trump’s second inauguration, where a decisive quorum of tech’s elite, after dutifully kicking in million-dollar checks, occupied front-row seats.\n“Everyone in the business world fears repercussions, because this administration is vindictive,” says venture capitalist David Hornik, one of the few outspoken voices of resistance. So Silicon Valley’s elite are engaged in a dangerous dance with a capricious administration—or as Michael Moritz, one of the Valley’s iconic VCs, put it to me, “They’re doing their best to avoid being held up in a protection racket.”\nJust ask Tim Cook. In May, Apple’s CEO took a pass on an 8,000-mile journey to join a presidential entourage in the Middle East. Trump noticed. In Qatar, the president said he had “a little problem” with Cook and the following day threatened a 25 percent tariff on iPhones.\nNot surprisingly, when I offered some of the Valley’s top executives the opportunity to vent this summer, few took the bait. Vacations seemed unusually long. Calendars were so packed that not a single slot was available for the next three weeks, four weeks, six weeks … when did you say your deadline was? One CEO notorious for logorrheic gabbing to reporters told me he was trying to “decompress” on politics. “But any time you want to talk AI or AI agents, please let me know!” he said.\nIt used to be that when tech’s leaders fell short of their lofty values, employees kept them honest. Google workers famously pressured their executives to fight for diversity and avoid military contracts. Implicit was the threat that the activists could easily find jobs elsewhere.\nThen Elon Musk came along and fired 80 percent of X’s employees, and the app didn’t collapse. Across the industry, diversity efforts are down and military contracts are up. In an April 2024 note to Google employees, CEO Sundar Pichai told employees not to “use the company as a personal platform, or to fight over disruptive issues or debate politics.” Free expression is also out of favor inside Meta, where an employee says the environment feels like the ’90s: “When you went to work, you didn’t bring your politics to the office, and you may not like the boss—but you do the job so you get paid,” they tell me. “Good luck finding a company that isn’t like that now.”\nWhat’s happened to Silicon Valley? Why did the Ayn Rand–loving heroes of tech become Donald Trump’s bootlickers? How did one of the supposedly smartest VCs wind up posting a manifesto that declared war on “trust and safety,” “tech ethics,” and “social responsibility”? What was the point of Jeff Bezos buying The Washington Post for civic benefit, as he claimed, and then right before the 2024 election, killing its Kamala Harris endorsement and changing its opinion section to editorials on “personal liberties and free markets”? And speaking of Cook, how is it that the most effective political tactic for the head of a $3.4 trillion company is to march into the Oval Office and solemnly present to Trump a glass-and-gold tchotchke?\nThis is Apple! Who knows what Cook—a man who has more in common with Martians than MAGA—was thinking as he stood before Trump and unboxed the most dubious, most obsequious product in the company’s near-half-century. Would Steve Jobs have done that? My guess: He’d have told his team to send over a gold-plated iPod. Collect on Delivery.\nEver since Jobs began selling the first sleek Apple II’s, digital technology has been touted as America’s pride and future. In its own geeky way, tech spoke truth to power. But now, says Stanford professor of social ethics of science and technology Rob Reich, “an extraordinarily tiny number of billionaires who control the information ecosystem have made allyship with the most consequential and fearsome political power in the world. There’s never been a time in history when those things have been combined.”\nIn a perverse sense this is good news for me—I cover that ecosystem and its oligarchs, so how great is it to be reporting on history? But in every other sense it’s wildly disturbing. Obviously, my stories evolved with the industry. But here’s something that took me by surprise: how quickly and decisively the visionaries I chronicled aligned themselves with Trump, a man whose values violently clashed with the egalitarian impulses of the digital revolution. How did I miss that? I revisited my familiar turf—which in this era seems suddenly unfamiliar—to find out.\nTo my shock and delight, I learned that the burgeoning PC industry was a nerdy successor to the political and cultural activism of the late 1960s. Some of the first computer startups sprang from the Homebrew Computer Club, organized by an antiwar activist. The club’s moderator had led the technology wing of the Berkeley Free Speech Movement. Even Bill Gates started out as a dope-toking rebel of sorts; his partner Paul Allen was a music freak who loved Jimi Hendrix. Apple cofounders Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak had barely grown out of their shaggy-haired days selling the “blue boxes” that allowed people to make illegal calls. Screw the Phone Company!\nI began a love affair with Silicon Valley. The wizards I met were changing the world with tools designed to uplift us—to give the common person the power of an expert. The electronic spreadsheet was sold as a business tool, but it was ultimately an antiestablishment weapon, because anyone with a low-cost PC could challenge the calculations of the executive suite. When Mitch Kapor, a former teacher of transcendental meditation, founded Lotus Development Corporation, which popularized the spreadsheet in the 1980s, he told his money guy that he valued people more than profits, and wanted to invest in his employees. “I was prepared for him to say no,” says Kapor. Fortunately for Kapor, the guy said yes.\nIn the famous “1984” Apple commercial for the Macintosh, an athlete flings a hammer at a Big Brother figure—she was out to pulverize authority. The headline of my Rolling Stone story about the Mac said it all: “The Whiz Kids Meet Darth Vader.” (Meaning IBM. Haha.) This was a righteous battle!\nOf course, Silicon Valley was never all flowers and psychedelics. “For all that it might flatter itself with counterculture roots, making money and accumulating power has always been in the mainstream,” says Kapor. And of course, the Valley’s politics always accommodated a strong libertarian strain.\nBut even venture capitalists seemed to vibe with the feeling of revolution—as if the Weathermen switched from making bombs to doing IPO road shows. When the internet arrived like a thunderclap, the ideological soundtrack became ear-splitting. In his celebrated 1996 “Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace,” my friend John Perry Barlow argued that the internet transcended earthbound laws and borders. “Your legal concepts of property, expression, identity, movement, and context do not apply to us,” he wrote.\nOh my God, did we post our hopes on the internet. When I first met them, Larry Page and Sergey Brin were wide-eyed idealists. Jeff Bezos came on like a buddy, eager to point out that Amazon employees, himself included, set up their computers on repurposed wooden doors instead of pricey desks. After my first conversation with Zuckerberg, he went home to a tiny apartment with no furniture.\nAnd then the giants of the internet scaled up their companies to impose their own concepts of expression, identity, and context. Those once humble leaders reaped unimaginable rewards. Now they can’t flaunt their riches enough—multiple homes, yachts, planes.\nOn a typically pleasant July day, I met up with Russell Hancock, who runs a think tank called Joint Venture Silicon Valley, in the living room of his Palo Alto home. He nabbed it during the 2000 tech crash; now you can’t buy a shack in Paly without near-generational wealth. Page and Zuckerberg, unsatisfied with a single homestead, have scooped up nearby properties, transforming once idyllic streets into supervillain compounds.\n“The people that are doing fabulously well, they’re really having a terrific time,” Hancock says. For everyone else in Silicon Valley, the wealth gap is getting more punishing, more absurd. When Apple had its IPO in 1980, Steve Jobs’ net worth topped an almost-unheard-of $100 million. Now Zuckerberg is reportedly offering AI researchers that much moolah for a single year’s labor. Hancock brings up the Gini coefficient, a measure of inequality that’s popular among the World Bank crowd. Since the ’90s, “we went from 30 on the Gini to 83,” he says. “Those are the conditions for the French Revolution.”\nAnother big change was unfolding. For the longest time, notes Chris Lehane, a former Bill Clinton staffer who has worked for companies like Airbnb and OpenAI, software “was almost like a fourth dimension.” Tech leaders could afford to stay out west and avoid politics. But then software products started to break down entire sectors of business. “These products were physically manifesting themselves in taxis, short-term rentals, and food delivery,” Lehane says, “bumping up against existing political systems, beliefs, laws.” Sometimes people died from that incursion. Old, beloved businesses closed. Local politicians got mad. To game the system, Silicon Valley jumped to the swamp. As one technologist in the current administration tells me, “The Valley now realizes it can’t ignore politics, because politics won’t ignore you.”\nNo wonder the public took a jaundiced view of the apps they couldn’t stop using. By the mid-2010s, people were attacking the big buses that transported tech workers to and from San Francisco, Mountain View, and Menlo Park, where employees pulled lattes in micro-kitchens, enjoyed midday massages, and discussed provocative left-wing politics.\nPerhaps the wizards of the PC and internet age were too successful. “We overdid it,” says Andy Hertzfeld, a programming legend who helped build the original Macintosh. “We were so idealistic in thinking everyone should use a computer and that we should make them lovable and fun.” The result, he laments, is a dystopia of phone-addicted teens and even the death of the homework essay.\nEssentially, the big tech companies became The Phone Company—pernicious behemoths who enshittify their products to extract more profits. You can’t even get a human customer-service person on the phone. In a 2024 survey of Silicon Valley residents, three-quarters of respondents felt tech companies have too much power; nearly as many believe they have lost their moral compass.\nThat’s why, even before Citizen Trump entered the White House in 2017, I found that the narrative in my stories had changed. I used to draw on the tale of David versus Goliath. Now I was writing the Icarus legend. I kept seeing that figure’s hubris in the tech elite. And it led them to Donald Trump.\nLehane, the former Clinton spokesperson, says that the administration and its agencies neither understood tech nor took much interest in it, “other than potentially trying to stop the technology from being developed.” Chief villains of the Biden era included Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan and Department of Justice antitrust head Jonathan Kanter. They methodically filed suits against Google, Amazon, Apple, and Meta. Khan blocked even modest mergers, threatening the entire ecosystem of smaller startups that now found it harder to negotiate profitable exits.\nBiden’s people make reasonable defenses—those companies do seem to have monopolies, after all. And look what happened to the design company Figma after Khan’s FTC scrutinized its potential merger with Adobe. Two years later it had a spectacular IPO.\nBut one of Biden’s biggest, most avoidable errors may have been his failure to invite Elon Musk to a 2021 event for electric vehicle manufacturers. The apparent reason was to keep the United Auto Workers happy, though the White House later claimed it was a fight over electric vehicle provisions that cost him his seat at the table. Even Reid Hoffman, one of the few tech billionaires who’s speaking out against Trump, thinks that was crazy. “You should invite the electric vehicle leader to the electric vehicle summit!” he says. “That was part of the radicalization of Elon.”\nOr, at least, part of the public narrative about why Musk, who had previously donated to Democratic candidates, went full MAGA. Other theories include radicalization during Covid, after the government stopped work at his California plant; radicalization by way of Twitter and too many sycophantic posts; or just that he was nuts. In any event, he got busy boosting right-wing content on X (especially his own posts), loudly supporting Trump, and of course donating almost $300 million to the Trump campaign. It used to be that “if you were Republican, or you said you were anti-tax, you had to go into hiding,” says Ryan Petersen, CEO of the logistics company Flexport. “Elon made it safe for everyone.”\nAnother Biden blunder, in the eyes of the tech elite, was his administration’s hostility to crypto. According to one top crypto executive I spoke with, the trouble started when one of the Dems’ biggest funders, crypto billionaire Samuel Bankman-Fried, was exposed as a massive fraudster. “It was an enormous embarrassment for the Democrats,” the executive told me. “So what do you do when you’re humiliated? You overreact.”\nBefore the scandal, companies had engaged in a constructive debate over regulation. But the SBF affair fortified the hard line that the head of the SEC, Gary Gensler, decided to take. (Gensler declined to be interviewed, though he did urge me to “keep up the good work at WIRED!”) Crypto people also blame Senator Elizabeth Warren, who many saw as Gensler’s supporter.\nThe crypto industry funneled hundreds of millions of dollars to Trump’s campaign. “We were always focused exclusively on what is good for crypto,” says Coinbase’s general counsel and former federal judge Paul Grewal. By midsummer 2024, Trump, who had earlier called cryptocurrencies a fraud, was appearing at a Bitcoin conference, promising to fire Gensler and make the US “the crypto capital of the planet.”\nEven Biden’s AI policy turned out to be radicalizing. The field’s key figures had seemed happy enough as they too debated regulation. But then AI went red-hot, and those companies needed massive investments in infrastructure—and a less restrictive set of rules. Guess who was ready to deliver. “In terms of him as a human being or a visionary, nobody’s a big Trump fan,” says Peter Leyden, an author (and former WIRED editor) writing a book on “the Great Progression” of technology. “But then AI hits—it’s game time. So they decided, ‘Fuck it, we’re gonna hook our tree to this crazy-ass Trump.’”\nIn his podcasts, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen complained bitterly about Biden’s policies on antitrust, AI, and diversity, and he expressed outrage that Biden would not meet with him personally. In his view, Biden—and indeed the general public—had not kept its part in what Andreessen called The Deal.\nHere’s how he described it to New York Times columnist Ross Douthat: An entrepreneur starts a company, makes a lot of money, and the world benefits from the new technology. “Then in your obituary, it talks about what an incredible person you were, both in your business career and in your philanthropic career. And by the way, you’re a Democrat, you’re pro–gay rights, you’re pro-abortion, you’re pro all the fashionable and appropriate social causes of the time … This is the Deal.”\nBy daring to challenge the tech industry, Biden threatened the moguls’ business plans. Even worse, he hurt their feelings. “It’s impossible to exaggerate how offended they were,” says Nick Clegg, who was Meta’s president of global affairs until early this year. In July 2024, Andreessen and his partner Ben Horowitz announced that they would be donating their dollars to Trump.\nSome of Andreessen’s gripes were over the top—no Marc, not all young employees lean Marxist—but he wasn’t the only one raging over diversity programs and political correctness. Across the Valley, it seemed, the Deal was off. “There’s a general sense in tech, even in the center left, that identity politics have gone too far,” says Leyden. Trae Stephens, the Founders Fund VC and Anduril cofounder, has seen it too. “My friends who are Democrats are not switching parties,” he tells me. “They’re just really tired of the Democrats.” Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, had been happily affiliated with the left. Earlier this year, he said on social media that politically he’s “homeless.” Though he seems to spend a lot of time with Trump.\nAnd then there’s Zuckerberg. I interviewed him frequently during Trump’s first term and was convinced he had genuine compassion for immigrants. I can’t recall him saying a nice thing about Trump. Sometime in the past year or so, positive words began spilling out. When Trump literally dodged a bullet on the campaign trail last summer and pumped his fist in the air, Zuckerberg called him a “badass.” Then came visits to the Joe Rogan podcast, where he griped that corporations were insufficiently manly, and Mar-a-Lago, where he reportedly blamed his former COO Sheryl Sandberg—the company’s champion of diversity—for all that unnecessary policing of toxic content and misinformation (a criticism he later denied). Now, Zuckerberg is not so much about immigrants. He and his wife, Priscilla, had funded a school in East Palo Alto, a low-income enclave. They are shutting it down.\n“I see Mark as a political shape-shifter whose number one goal is the survival and thriving of the company,” a Meta executive tells me. “Trump is so transactional that you can fight him and get fucked, or you can try to work with him and get a percentage of what you want.”\nTo tech’s power elite, Trump’s tit-for-tat nature is not a bug but a feature. “A lot of these guys find Trump very familiar,” says Clegg. “You go down to Mar-a-Lago, and he goes, ‘Let’s do a deal.’ That charm of Trump is incredibly intoxicating to Silicon Valley tech bros.”\nWas Biden really so bad for tech? Democrats I spoke to who were in the White House or in Congress in those years say they were simply holding an overreaching industry to account—for its own good. “I don’t think we screwed up on policy,” says Tim Wu, who was Biden’s special assistant for tech and competition. “Our goal was to keep the tech industry healthy by forcing it to continue to innovate.”\nThe strategy doesn’t seem to have worked. In the first months of 2025, the Trump administration lifted regulations that irritated the tech industry. “America’s AI Action Plan” focuses on establishing US dominance. So long, regulation! The crypto bros saw not only the departure of the hated SEC chair Gensler but the passage of a bill that legitimized their industry. And Trump appointees recently overruled the Justice Department’s antitrust division to allow a major tech merger to go through.\nTrump’s tariffs, of course, present big problems for business. But it turns out that you can run pretty well on a bended knee. Take Jensen Huang, who heads Nvidia. The administration was expected to take a hard line on selling chips to China. Huang unleashed a full-throttled lobbying effort that took him from Mar-a-Lago to Saudi Arabia. He pledged $500 billion in US investments. He bad-mouthed Biden to a congressional committee. By the time Huang was done, Trump was calling him a friend and easing export controls on his chips. When Trump spoke at an AI Summit in July, Huang was there to celebrate—and wisely not taking credit. When it was Huang’s turn on stage, he got straight to the point. “America’s unique advantage that no other country could possibly have,” he said, “is President Trump.”\nLater, Huang learned that the administration would help itself to a 15 percent cut of gross sales to China. Not long afterward, Trump grabbed 10 percent of Intel. It seems that America’s “unique advantage” is relentless in grabbing power for himself, even from those who debase themselves before him. In the long run, these deluded CEOs may realize this isn’t realpolitik. It’s a suicide pact.\nWhen we talk, Tusk rattles off what he views as the components of US tech exceptionalism—independent markets and institutions, freedom of speech, intellectual property protections, strong educational institutions, decent immigration policy. Then his voice gets hard. “Trump is doing the opposite of every single one of those things,” he says. “There is definitely potential that he will destroy everything that makes the US economy unique and successful.”\nStart with immigration. Perhaps no group of techies has ridden Trump’s coattails more than the four chatty investor-bros who host the All In podcast. Three of the “besties,” as they call themselves, were born overseas. During the election season, two besties, venture capitalists Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks, threw a fundraiser at Sacks’ house with tickets as high as $300,000. Soon after, Trump rewarded them by going on their podcast. (Sacks is now Trump’s AI and crypto czar.) Some of the questions were big fat softballs like, “I never understood why the [border] wall was controversial.” But even they couldn’t get behind his immigration policy. Didn’t Trump recognize that the tech world thrives on foreign-born wizards?\nTo their astonishment, he not only agreed but promised that in his administration, any foreign student who completes a degree would get a green card. The besties were giddy.\nIt was too good to be true. Hours later, the MAGA base aflame, the Trump campaign issued a statement negating what he’d said. Now that he’s back in the White House, he and his vice president have remained two-faced—assuring tech audiences that they want the best foreign students while making it harder for companies to hire and retain that talent. At one point Trump moved to block any foreigner from enrolling in America’s oldest university. That hasn’t happened yet, but this summer the Department of Homeland Security proposed a new regulation that limits foreign student visas to four years—not enough to get a PhD or, for many, even an undergraduate degree. The number of students coming from overseas has tanked.\n“We’re definitely seeing the chilling effect,” says Harj Taggar, a managing partner at Y Combinator. While YC’s international founders have so far managed to enter the country, applicants with student visas are more reluctant to leave school to join the program. He’s seeing foreign students consider going to London to work or start companies. “They feel it’s maybe not as safe to be here,” he says. “That makes me really sad.”\nI’ve got a few more reasons for Taggar to feel really sad: the mass cancellation of science and research funding, for one. Goodbye, next generation of engineers and computer scientists. “In the name of punishing woke-ism, we’re going to absolutely hobble the innovation engine that has created the economic gains of the last 50 years,” says Hornik, the venture capitalist.\nThen there’s the mounting effect of Trump’s favor-collecting and favoritism—buying that chunk of Intel, claiming that slice of Nvidia’s sales. In corruption-riddled countries, winners aren’t chosen by merit but by apparatchiks and strongmen. Those nations are doomed to second- or third-tier status. In his preelection appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast, Zuckerberg said as much himself. “At least the US has the rule of law,” he remarked. “If other governments decide that they’re going to go after you, you don’t always get a clear shake at defending yourself on the rules.” Guess what—now we’re like those other governments! Zuckerberg, no dummy, has probably figured this out, but now he’s locked into Trumpland, outplayed in a real-life game of Risk.\nMany of the people I spoke with for this story are centrist liberals. They are a disheartened bunch, and talking to them was hazardous to my own heart. In interview after interview, I asked them what, if anything, might force the industry to confront its dim longer-term prospects. Their answers were vague. The midterm election? An economic collapse? One Silicon Valley figure suggested, “It could be as simple as 10 Republican senators discovering they actually have backbones.”\nOr 10 big-time CEOs, I might add. They can unbend their knees and perhaps revive some of the Valley’s soul. Or at least stop ripping it apart. And while they’re at it, stop making it so easy for the government to usher in an AI-powered surveillance state.\nMaybe that’s the thing I got most wrong about Silicon Valley. Those Davids I wrote about seemed fearless and full of verve as they challenged what was possible and rode the power of the chip and the net. I mistook this for character. They may believe, as Moritz told me, that submitting to Trump’s protection racket protects their shareholders. But tech giants are certainly capable of standing up for the long-term viability of their industry. And for democracy. So far they are doing the opposite. “I think they have made a bad deal,” says Tim Wu. “Everyone who thought they could work some deal with Trump ends up getting burned, if not imprisoned.”\nThere will probably be no reckoning. Tech leaders, like all rich people, always have alternatives to life in a declining country. Reid Hoffman has his, as he put it, “contingency plans.” Another source for this story let drop that he’s getting Portuguese citizenship. Lovely country. But it’s hard to imagine myself as a young reporter, roaming the streets of Lisbon and finding the excitement and promise I discovered in California. It’s even harder to imagine a young reporter finding that spirit in the industry as it stands today. The way I now feel in Silicon Valley is how Sam Altman described himself politically: homeless.\n\nLet us know what you think about this article.

Namely, the plan to reduce the Washington-based USDA staff presence from 4,600 strong down to 2,000 and to send functions to the hinterlands was an affront to the managerial class.\n\nAs a veteran of five different federal and state government agencies (Matt), the outcry came as no surprise. What did, however, was the boldness of the proposal and Rollins’s willingness to enact what political scientists have discussed for decades, namely, working to reconcile bureaucratic governance and democratic theory.\n\nHear me out:\n\nThe core coursework in any public administration graduate degree program includes studying representative bureaucracy. This program prepares future government managers — I am guilty of completing it. Government agencies should have a diverse plurality of personnel that share the same values as the population they serve, to keep the agency accountable and legitimate as a democratic institution.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election results showed the blatant discrepancy between Washington and the rest of the nation, with over 90% of the District of Columbia voting for Vice President Kamala Harris while less than 50% of the broader country did. This lack of national representation within the bureaucracy is a major reason that the public has lost trust in government. The Washington bubble is real. It has affected democratic legitimacy and made government employees believe they have a mandate to impose their will on their positions instead of serving the wants and needs of the people.\n\nRollins’s relocation plan is a bold move to place government decision-makers among those whom they serve and to restore trust in our democratic institutions. This is a key reason that agency relocation was included as part of America First Policy Institute’s “America First” agenda to drain the swamp.\n\nAt the same time, Rollins’s move is also good management science. In Lean manufacturing, the management philosophy created by Toyota, there is a maxim that helps explain the company’s dynamism of the 1990s: “Go to the Gemba.” This phrase refers to the importance of managers visiting the places where the work takes place to ensure they understand and are enabling those doing the work.\n\nWhen I (Kip) was the ambassador to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Agencies in Rome, I had the opportunity to travel the continent to see exactly how American agricultural exports were treated in Europe. I witnessed firsthand how unfair trade practices were for American farmers. The experience of being in those countries and in the room as part of those conversations among my international colleagues was invaluable, and the lessons learned could not have been gleaned from a U.S.-based office.\n\nThe same is true for the USDA. Being located among the farmers, ranchers, and rural communities will allow government staffers to gain knowledge and wisdom from the folks who use the programs they manage.\n\nImagine an agricultural researcher being able to easily and routinely visit commercial farms where innovative production practices are being used, return to the office, and brief actual decision-makers in person without typing memorandums to Washington that might never be read.\n\nOr, imagine program managers being able to gain insights into the impacts of their work through daily conversations with their rural neighbors and how that would improve the speed of feedback to enable beneficial program pivots. These are the benefits of “going to the Gemba,” and when the farm is your Gemba, an office in Washington simply won’t do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE “REFORMING THE DEEP STATE” SERIES\n\nDuring the last election, voters made clear that the federal government had grown unaccountable and that they did not trust the direction that the decision-makers in Washington were taking the country. The USDA’s proposed reorganization and relocation plan is a bold effort to change that dynamic and redemocratize our government.\n\nIn an era where bureaucracy wields immense power, this proposal demonstrates a true commitment to representative government and to a smarter, leaner executive branch.\n\nKip E.

Mikie Sherrill’s carefully choreographed campaign appearances and occasional gaffes have given fodder to allies of her Republican foe, some of whom have branded her as “the Kamala Harris of New Jersey.’’\n\nGOP opponent Jack Ciattarelli’s team believes Sherrill’s cautious campaign has given its candidate momentum as he struggles with a significant deficit in voter surveys.\n\n“She’s a gaffe machine, frankly,” said Chris Russell, a New Jersey GOP consultant who works with the Ciattarelli campaign, to The Post.\n\n“There’s similarities [between Sherrill and Harris] in that they both are incapable of answering basic questions and seem to have a penchant for putting their foot in their mouth,” he said. “[They] hide from the press, hide from the public [and are] very, very managed and choreographed.”\n\nCiattarelli is making hay of Sherrill’s perceived aloofness as he criss-crosses New Jersey, running on a toned-down MAGA platform that includes kitchen-table issues such as skyrocketing utility prices and the highest-in-the-nation property taxes.\n\nHis team has claimed that Sherrill has had less unscripted face-time with voters than he has — even as she missed 64% of votes in Congress between July and September, according to GovTrack.\n\n“I do this for a living — I know what it looks like when you pick out just your supporters to go to the event,” said GOP strategist Alex Wiles.\n\n“Everyone I’ve seen with her looks highly curated, like there was a heavy hand in the selection process. … It’s just safe towns, safe places, safe faces.”\n\nEven some nonpartisan outside observers have noted that Sherrill’s campaign feels laconic — perhaps for good reason, because of her massive polling lead.\n\n“Mikie Sherril is very much running what we call a Rose Garden strategy. She’s doing very few interviews. She’s doing relatively few unscripted moments,” said Dan Cassino, a politics professor and executive director of the Fairleigh Dickinson University Poll.\n\n“The strategy Sherrill is running has been effective for other candidates,” he said.\n\nSherrill’s team is downplaying the attacks against her from “two-time loser Jack Ciattarelli” as futile and contends that the congresswoman is connecting with voters in ways he never could.\n\nThis is the third time Ciattarelli has run for Jersey governor.\n\n“Mikie has gotten support from fellow veterans to seniors to families struggling to make ends meet to young people hoping to build their future in New Jersey,” Sherrill campaign rep Sam Chan said.\n\n“Jack’s campaign is desperate because Mikie is fighting for every New Jersey family and Jack is only out for himself and follows Trump’s lead without a shred of independence.”\n\nSherrill has a commanding 8.8 percentage point lead over Ciattarelli in polls so far, according to the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate.\n\nOnly one known poll has the GOPer up, an outlier internal survey commissioned by Ciattarelli’s campaign, which pegs him in the lead 46% to 45%.\n\nCiattarelli’s campaign, which began TV ads earlier this month, recently took to the airwaves to zing Sherrill for being flummoxed during an interview in May when asked about the top piece of legislation she’d like to get across the finish line.\n\n“That’s a really good question, ’cause there’s so many that are coming to mind right now,” she replied, stalling for about 18 seconds before conjuring up a vague federal block grant program — something beyond the purview of the legislature and governor.\n\nThe clip is reminiscent of the word salads that former Vice President Harris became infamous for while in office.\n\nSherrill cut her teeth in national politics in the halls of Congress and was first elected during the country’s 2018 blue-wave year to succeed former Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen, the top GOPer on the powerful House Appropriations Committee at the time.\n\nSherrill, a former federal prosecutor, was famously one of three relatively centrist female Dems with national security credentials who were elected to the House that year — alongside Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), who is now in the Senate, and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.), who’s vying to be governor of Virginia.\n\nBut now she’s being forced to focus on issues close to home.\n\n“She doesn’t seem to have a grasp of the policies of New Jersey and state government,” New Jersey GOP strategist Jeanette Hoffman said.\n\n“Look, it’s a lot easier to be one of 435 members of Congress than it is to lead a complicated state like New Jersey.”\n\nIn a departure from his unsuccessful 2021 campaign for governor, Ciattarelli has seemingly been more open-armed toward Trump and the MAGA agenda. \n\nPart of this means calling for an end to sanctuary state laws, despite roughly 23% of New Jersey’s population being foreign-born — the second highest in the nation.\n\nBut Ciattarelli is also focusing on pocketbook issues.\n\nHis campaign recently took aim at Sherrill’s plan to address energy costs in the state, a touchy subject, particularly after New Jersey’s Board of Public Utilities warned this year that electric bills could spike between 17% and 20%.\n\nHis team cut an ad showcasing Sherrill’s comments in a March interview, faulting Democrats’ messaging on clean energy as often being along the lines of, “It’s going to cost you an arm and a leg, but if you’re a good person, you’ll do it.”\n\nIn the interview, Sherrill argued that a green-energy push will be “cheaper than any other source of power,” but that context wasn’t included in the ad, prompting her team to rip the spot as a “blatantly misleading, desperate smear.”","summary":"New Jersey Rep.

What To Know","text":"ABC's decision to suspend Jimmy Kimmel Live! has sparked questions about whether the late-night host could pursue legal action, particularly against President Donald Trump and federal regulators.In criticizing how some Republicans reacted to Charlie Kirk's death, Jimmy Kimmel alleged that conservatives were using Kirk's assassination for political advantage rather than mourning the conservative activist sincerely. Trump said Kimmel had said \"a horrible thing\" about Kirk and praised ABC's decision to pull Jimmy Kimmel Live! off the air.Why It MattersThe dispute cuts to the heart of how far government officials can pressure media outlets without violating the First Amendment. If regulators can threaten broadcasters' licenses to influence programming decisions, critics warn it could chill not only comedians but also journalists, academics and other public voices from speaking freely.The outcome could set an important precedent for media independence and democratic norms in an era of escalating political polarization.What Did Jimmy Kimmel Say About Charlie Kirk?On September 15, during his opening monologue, Kimmel addressed the fallout from Kirk's killing, saying, \"Many in MAGA land are working very hard to capitalize on the murder of Charlie Kirk.\"He added, \"The MAGA gang [is] desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.\"On September 18, Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr publicly warned that broadcasters airing content like Kimmel's could face regulatory review, a statement critics argued was intended to pressure networks into compliance.Hours later, ABC announced that it was indefinitely suspending Jimmy Kimmel Live!—which premiered on the network on January 26, 2003.In an interview with podcaster Benny Johnson, Carr said: \"We can do this the easy way or the hard way. These companies can find ways to change conduct and take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\"\"They have a license granted by us at the FCC, and that comes with it an obligation to operate in the public interest,\" he continued.Carr called Kimmel's remarks \"some of the sickest conduct possible,\" adding that it could constitute \"news distortion.\"After the show was taken off the air, Carr said, \"We're not done yet with seeing the consequences of that.\"Anna Gomez, the sole Democratic commissioner at the FCC, told CNN while commenting on Carr's remarks, \"This administration is increasingly using the weight of government power to suppress lawful expression.\"The Trump administration has long clashed with late-night hosts and media outlets the president views as hostile, and allies have defended the FCC's involvement—describing it as oversight rather than censorship.The Core Legal QuestionFor Kimmel to succeed in a First Amendment lawsuit, he would need to show that his suspension was not simply a corporate decision made by ABC or Nexstar but the result of coercive government action.Courts generally hold that free speech protections apply to state action, not private companies acting independently. If ABC pulled the program in response to FCC threats, such as license revocation, Kimmel could claim a constitutional injury.The challenge lies in proving that government pressure, rather than business or reputational concerns, caused the decision.Precedent and the Chilling EffectLegal scholars point to recent Supreme Court precedent underscoring that government officials cannot pressure private actors to suppress speech.In NRA v. Vullo, the court held in its 2023 ruling that officials could not coerce third parties into penalizing disfavored viewpoints.Eugene Volokh, a professor emeritus at UCLA Law, told Newsweek: \"If ABC was pressured into suspending the Kimmel program by threat of FCC retaliation, then that would likely violate the First Amendment. The key precedent on this is NRA v. Vullo, where the Supreme Court made clear that 'government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors.'\"Volokh added: \"I can't speak with confidence about whether ABC acted because of government pressure or just based on its own disapproval of Kimmel's comments ... or perhaps a business judgment about the public's disapproval.\"Experts on Coercion and Free SpeechOther constitutional experts emphasized the gravity of government involvement in media decisions. RonNell Andersen Jones, a professor at the University of Utah, told Newsweek: \"The Supreme Court has repeatedly made clear that government officials cannot attempt to coerce private parties in order to punish or suppress views that the government disfavors. Given the complex mix of corporate and governmental decisions that were made here, it's unclear whether any parties will bring this First Amendment claim. But we do see the government openly acknowledging that it encouraged the development, which is extraordinary.\"The Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University issued a sharper critique. Jameel Jaffer, its executive director, told Newsweek: \"The Trump administration is becoming increasingly brazen in its abuse of government power to silence its critics—in part because too many of the powerful institutions that could stand up to this thuggery are capitulating instead. Collectively, we need to do more to assert and defend the freedoms that are essential to our democracy, including the freedom to criticize the powerful.\"Obstacles to LitigationEven with supportive precedent, legal hurdles remain significant.If a suit is brought, courts may require clear evidence that FCC threats directly influenced ABC's choice. Internal communications between regulators and broadcasters would be critical in discovery.Remedies may also be limited: While Kimmel could seek an injunction to prevent retaliation or compel ABC to restore his program, securing damages is less likely.Another complication lies in broadcast regulation itself.While FCC license revocations are rare, Nexstar's pending merger, which would exceed the statutory cap on national market reach, may have heightened sensitivity to regulatory pressure.This intersection of corporate interests and political speech complicates the case beyond a straightforward censorship claim.What People Are SayingPresident Donald Trump said aboard Air Force One when asked whether Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr should go after other talk show hosts: \"They give me only bad publicity or press. I mean, they're getting a license. I would think maybe their license should be taken away.\"Trump said in his inaugural address in Washington, D.C., on January 20: \"After years and years of illegal and unconstitutional federal efforts to restrict free expression, I also will sign an executive order to immediately stop all government censorship and bring back free speech to America.\"Then-Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance said at a rally in Wausau, Wisconsin, on October 26, 2024, while commenting on the backlash against a conservative comedian's joke about Puerto Rico: \"I think that it's telling that Kamala Harris' closing message is, essentially, that all of Donald Trump's voters are Nazis and you should get really pissed off about a comedian telling a joke. That is not the message of a winning campaign, and most importantly, it's not the message of a person who's fit to be the president of the United States of America. ... I think that we have to stop getting so offended at every little thing in the United States of America.\"What Happens NextA lot depends on whether Kimmel pursues legal action. He could file a First Amendment lawsuit arguing that FCC threats unlawfully pressured ABC to suspend his show or challenge the agency through administrative law, but success would hinge on evidence showing government coercion rather than corporate discretion.Even without a lawsuit, the controversy is fueling debate over media independence, with advocacy groups calling out potential overreach and the FCC's pending review of Nexstar's merger heightening industry sensitivity to regulatory pressure.","summary":"Kimmel's suspension raises First Amendment stakes over the president's role in pressuring media voices.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/could-jimmy-kimmel-sue-donald-trump-canceled-what-know-2133521","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2727154/jimmy-kimmel-pulled-over-kirk-comments.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=f0866881f735d88fd723cab093ae8dd7","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 09:08:32","author":"Robert Alexander","authors":["Robert Alexander"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":362479702,"title":"Harris is speaking. This time, she isn’t bending to Biden’s bullies","text":"\"He has to run because she can’t.\" \"She\" was Vice President Kamala Harris. \"He\" was President Joe Biden. The message was clear: Biden had to run because his team didn’t believe she could. \"Then why did you pick her in the first place?\" I asked as I sank back into my seat on Brightstar, the first lady’s plane. BIDEN AIDES BLAST HARRIS BOOK EXCERPTS, ADDING VP 'WAS SIMPLY NOT GOOD AT THE JOB': REPORT Silence. Deflection. Business as usual. We were instructed to parrot one line — \"No one runs for president for four years.\" That was the strategy. Harris’s forthcoming book, according to recently released excerpts, says what insiders whispered for years: the Biden bubble was full of bullies. The former vice president is finally saying the quiet part out loud. KAMALA HARRIS COMPLAINS ABOUT 'IMPOSSIBLE' LACK OF SUPPORT FROM BIDEN'S COMMS TEAM, INNER CIRCLE Biden won the most votes of anyone for president in our country’s history. But he never won the hearts and minds of the American people, and especially not of his own party. That fragile foundation collapsed fast. The Biden White House was filled with its share of cartoonist characters out of a badly cast high school version of \"West Side Story.\" They thought they were a \"BFD\" because they had worked in a previous administration or because our campaign defied the odds and beat expectations. But they had no instincts for the shifting media and political landscape — and no instinct for politics as it is now lived and practiced in the age of Donald Trump. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi was more direct, \"I’ve never been that impressed with his political operation,\" referring to Biden’s team. There was no pragmatic truth-teller, because no one admitted that we weren’t a movement. We swaggered like we’d won President Barack Obama’s mandate or his congressional majorities. We hadn’t. We lost 13 Democratic House seats on our way in. From the moment Biden won the nomination, no one ever wanted to admit the obvious: Democrats felt stuck with us, not inspired by us. HARRIS ADMITS BIDEN 'GOT TIRED,' DENIES 'CONSPIRACY' TO HIDE MENTAL DECLINE Inside the White House, the Regina Georges of Biden’s circle ruled like mean girls and policed loyalty. Staff weren’t serving a president and first lady — they were serving a cult. You never knew when Regina was in charge or when the Bidens were. It was all blurred. Joe and Jill Biden were warm, decent, empathetic. But they enabled some of the nastiest and most mean-spirted people I’ve ever encountered in politics. That contradiction defines the Biden era. I believed in Joe Biden once. After hearing him and Jill deliver barnburner speeches at the 2018 Human Rights Campaign gala, I was convinced he was the champion to take on Trump. As someone who endured relentless bullying growing up, Biden’s words about standing up for LGBT youth resonated. I left determined to join his effort. One year later, Biden was in the race, and I was chief spokesperson to his very influential and active spouse. KAMALA HARRIS SCOLDS 'PILING ON' AGAINST JOE BIDEN WHEN ASKED ABOUT SEPARATING HERSELF DURING 2024 CAMPAIGN In the summer of 2020, Jill reintroduced herself to the country while launching \"Joey,\" her children’s book about young Joe Biden — a natural leader who stood up to bullies. \"School was where the bullies were.\" He stood up for himself and \"also defended others from bullies,\" Jill wrote. Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi was more direct, \"I’ve never been that impressed with his political operation,\" referring to Biden’s team. \"We were expected to stand up to bullies,\" Valerie Biden Owens wrote in her memoir, \"Growing Up Biden.\" Biden’s final mission, he said, was to save the country from Trump — who Democrats consider to be the ultimate bully. KAMALA HARRIS HAD PROFANE MESSAGE FOR GOVERNORS UNEASY ABOUT SUPPORTING BIDEN But bullies are everywhere, even among Democrats, and despite his brand — even around Biden. When I entered the fraught world of part-time punditry, there were times I questioned the strategic direction of the Biden reelection effort. When the economic message was \"Bidenomics is working,\" I explained why it was an error and pushed alternatives. When the polls were bad, I said so. How could I say the sky is red when we all know it’s blue? \"It will always feel like friendly fire to them,\" MSNBC television host Nicolle Wallace warned me. \"But all you have is your credibility,\" she emphasized. I wanted to be taken seriously, not just another robot regurgitating thoughtless talking points. I balanced my love for and personal loyalty to the Biden family with candid and thoughtful analysis. But the president’s bullies didn’t see it that way. To them, I had taken off the team jersey by pointing out missed opportunities and mistakes, so they came for me. The example they tried to make of me was meant to serve as a warning to any Democrat who raised concerns ahead of 2024. The same bullies who claimed to serve a president who despised bullies were sending me a message: shut up or we’ll humiliate you. In time, however, the roots of their insecurity would be revealed to the entire world on a debate stage, one tragic June night in Atlanta. Biden’s bullies and their intimidation tactics would crumble over the course of four long, hot, summer weeks — along with their credibility. Bullies don’t win. They implode.

The crimson tide has run wide and deep ever since.\n\nThose riding the tide have included Jacobins, Bolsheviks, National Socialists, Maoists, Black Lives Matter incendiaries, antifa thugs and gender-ideology hit men.\n\nAmong its victims, over the course of 236 years, are aristocrats, Christians, Jews, bourgeoisie, kulaks, intellectuals, dissidents and conservative hero Charlie Kirk.\n\nOur culture of violence was shaped by the revolutionary left, which has infiltrated every aspect of society, including higher education and entertainment.\n\nAccording to a 2024 survey by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, 25% of liberal college students approve of violence to stop conservatives from speaking on campus.\n\nOnly 55% of Gen Z believe political violence is never acceptable, compared with 93% of baby boomers and 86% of Gen X. In a 2024 Rasmussen survey, 28% of Democrats said America would have been better off if President Trump had died by an assassin’s bullet. Another 24% said they were unsure.\n\nThose celebrating Mr. Kirk’s demise include professors, teachers, physicians, airline pilots, elected officials and even a U.S. Army colonel, since relieved of duty. Can you imagine anyone in a position of authority in 1963 applauding the assassination of President Kennedy?\n\nLeftist violence is an almost daily occurrence. The death toll includes law enforcement, business leaders and prominent conservatives. New Left philosopher Herbert Marcuse taught a generation of activists that silencing so-called oppressors was justified in the name of the fight for equality.\n\nWhen the Supreme Court was deliberating on reversing Roe v. Wade, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer warned justices that if they did so, they would “release the whirlwind” and “pay the price.” This was followed by weeks of illegal demonstrations at the homes of conservative justices and an attempt to assassinate Associate Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nMost Democratic politicians condoned the rioting after the death of George Floyd in 2020, including Massachusetts Gov. Maura Healey, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and then-Sen. Kamala Harris, whose staff set up a bail fund for rioters.\n\nBlack Lives Matter organized the arson and looting. Patrisse Cullors, one of its co-founders, described herself as a “trained Marxist.” She was recruited to the cause by Eric Mann, a former member of the terrorist group Weather Underground.\n\nTyler Robinson, charged with killing Mr. Kirk, is the latest link in a chain stretching back to the Reign of Terror. Messages on his rifle and bullet casings include Bella Ciao, a slogan adopted by antifa, along with the word “fascist.” Antifa’s latest campaign is assaulting immigration enforcement agents.\n\nAntifa is a contraction of anti-fascist. If you disagree with it on race, sexuality or immigration, you are a Nazi, and they have carte blanche to attack you. They sent independent journalist Andy Ngo to the hospital for exposing their tactics. Mr. Trump just announced he will designate antifa as a major terrorist organization.\n\nLast week, an activist judge dismissed terrorism charges against Luigi Mangione, charged with murder in the death of health care CEO Brian Thompson. Like Mr. Robinson, Mr. Mangione is part of the left-wing assassination culture.\n\nAccording to indictments, Mr. Robinson killed Mr. Kirk for his views on transgenderism and Mr. Mangione killed Thompson to strike a blow against the health care industry.\n\nConservative commentator Charles Krauthammer once observed: “To understand the workings of American politics, you have to understand this fundamental law: Conservatives think liberals are stupid. Liberals think conservatives are evil.”\n\nWhat do you do with someone you think is stupid? If you’re Charlie Kirk, you try to educate them.\n\nWhat do you do with someone you consider evil? You send them to the guillotine. You put them against the wall. You stick them in a gulag or death camp. You shoot them in the neck with a high-powered rifle.\n\nThe left’s utopian vision can be realized only with bloodshed. It asks us to give up our property, our families, our faith and our freedom for a classless society.\n\nFor the envious, the malicious and those desperate to merge their identity with a cause, that may work. In certain circumstances it may even work with a majority — for a time.\n\nEventually, however, reason will prevail. People will get tired of being robbed, starved and beaten. That’s why violence is necessary to build the workers’ paradise — that and free bus service — and violence is needed to maintain it.\n\nThe building process includes dealing with counterrevolutionaries by any means necessary.\n\n• Don Feder is a columnist with The Washington Times.","summary":"The left was born in bloodshed","url":"https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2025/sep/21/left-born-bloodshed/","image":"https://media.washtimes.com/media/image/2025/09/20/B3federLGleftrevolution.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 07:35:34","author":"Don Feder","authors":["Don Feder"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.079},{"id":362442728,"title":"Kamala Harris: Why running with gay man Pete Buttigieg was ‘too big of a risk’","text":"Former US Vice President Kamala Harris has revealed she did not want a gay, male Democrat to run with her in her bid for the presidency as she felt it would be “a lot” to ask of America.\n\nMs Harris’ name was thrust to the top of the Democrat ticker after then-US President Joe Biden pulled out of the 2024 election following a train wreck debate against Donald Trump.\n\nMr Biden resisted the urge to step down over concerns relating to his age and cognitive function, eventually announcing that he would not seek reelection.\n\nHis move gave Ms Harris just 107 days to run for the presidency.\n\nWhen it came to picking a vice presidential candidate, one immensely popular Democrat’s name kept coming up in speculation.\n\nPete Buttigieg.\n\nThe respected Democrat is a former naval officer who was deployed in Afghanistan, a graduate of Harvard College, a recipient of the Rhodes Scholarship at the University of Oxford and, as of 2021, the first openly gay Cabinet secretary in US history.\n\nIn 2019, he sought out the Democratic nomination to run for the presidency, however, dropped out and endorsed Mr Biden.\n\nIn 2020, following Mr Biden’s election win against Mr Trump, Mr Buttigieg was named the President’s nominee for Secretary of Transportation, a nomination which was confirmed on February 2, 2021.\n\nMr Buttigieg is also a former mayor, having served the community of South Bend, Indiana for eight years.\n\nHe is also personally close with Ms Harris.\n\nIn her new book 107 Days, which is released on September 23 in Australia, Ms Harris reveals she wanted to pick Mr Buttigieg as her running mate, however, his sexuality made her choose someone else.\n\nShe writes that Mr Buttigieg “would have been an ideal partner—if he were a straight white man,” as revealed by The Atlantic which recently published an excerpt from the book.\n\n“But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man,” Ms Harris adds.\n\n“Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let’s just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.\n\n“I think Pete also knew that—to our mutual sadness.”\n\nThe decision from Ms Harris could be seen as a contributing factor to her loss.

He then allegedly asked if Harris was familiar with several people related to the matter, but she was not.\n\n“His brother had told him that those guys were not going to support me because I’d been saying bad things about him. He wasn’t inclined to believe it, he claimed, but he thought I should know in case my team had been encouraging me to put daylight between the two of us,” Harris wrote in the book, according to an excerpt of the book in The Guardian.\n\nBiden then went on to talk about his past debate performances, leaving Harris confused, “angry and disappointed,” according to The Guardian. She was upset that her boss had called before a critical moment in her political career and made “it all about himself.” Harris added that Biden was “distracting me with worry about hostile power-brokers in the biggest city of the most important state.”\n\nThen-second gentleman Doug Emhoff apparently noticed his wife was in distress and advised her to “let it go” before facing off against Trump.\n\nWhile Harris avoided criticizing Biden during her campaign, she has used her upcoming book to shed light on the tensions between them as she took his place as the Democratic presidential nominee. Harris’ book is set to hit shelves on Sept. 23, but it has already sparked conversations about the 2024 election cycle.\n\nIn another section, Harris said while “It’s Joe and Jill’s decision” became a mantra ahead of the 2024 election cycle, she said it was “recklessness,” rather than “grace,” according to an excerpt released by The Atlantic.\n\n“‘It’s Joe and Jill’s decision.’ We all said that, like a mantra, as if we’d all been hypnotized. Was it grace, or was it recklessness? In retrospect, I think it was recklessness. The stakes were simply too high. This wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition. It should have been more than a personal decision,” Harris wrote.\n\nHarris also revealed in her book that then-Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg was her “first choice” as running mate, not Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. However, she said it was “too big of a risk” because the campaign was “already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man.”\n\nFox News Digital’s Deirdre Heavey and Greg Norman contributed to this report.","summary":"Kamala Harris revealed in her upcoming book, \"107 Days,\" that then-President Joe Biden rattled her right before she went head-to-head with then-candidate Donald Trump on the debate stage.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/22/us-news/kamala-harris-reveals-what-biden-told-her-just-before-crucial-debate-with-trump-that-left-her-angry/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/us-vice-president-democratic-presidential-111919493.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Bbr8FRdP-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-22 05:16:50","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.152},{"id":362390468,"title":"Taylor Swift skips Travis Kelce's Sunday night NFL showdown in New York amid recent safety concerns","text":"Taylor Swift skips Travis Kelce's Sunday night NFL showdown in New York amid recent safety concerns\n\nREAD MORE: Kelce arrives at MetLife as Chiefs look to turn season around\n\nBy JAMES COHEN, SPORTS REPORTER\n\nPublished: 02:01 BST, 22 September 2025 | Updated: 02:18 BST, 22 September 2025\n\nTaylor Swift opted to skip Travis Kelce's must-win game on Sunday night amid growing safety concerns surrounding the global superstar.\n\nKelce and the Chiefs faced off against the New York Giants at MetLife Stadium as they looked for their first win of the season after losing their first two games, leaving Patrick Mahomes 0-2 for the first time in his career. \n\nTight end Kelce had his game-face on as he was pictured entering the stadium on Sunday in a sleek, purple suit - but there was no sign of Swift on the night.\n\nIn the first quarter, the Giants teased her attendance at the game with a 'Taylor Cam' on the jumbotron, initially showing the back of a blonde-haired woman - only to reveal NFL legend Lawrence Taylor instead. \n\nThe other Swift - global superstar singer Taylor - was seen at the Chiefs game against the Eagles last weekend, where she arrived behind what was believed to have been a bullet-resistant screen.\n\nInsiders recently revealed to the Daily Mail that Chiefs players were warned in advance that there would be heightened security at the game.\n\nThe insider pointed to increased tensions in the wake of Charlie Kirk's murder at an event in Utah, which came just days before the Chiefs game against the Eagles.\n\nTaylor Swift opted to skip Travis Kelce's game against the New York Giants on Sunday night\n\nA week prior, the popstar was shielded by what is believed to have been a bullet-resistant screen as she made her way inside Arrowhead Stadium\n\n'They used the screen to keep her safe,' the insider said. 'They have used that screen before, but usually it is for the President or someone like that, not a celebrity. But this was a weird week.'\n\nConservative activist Kirk, 31, was assassinated by a gunman last Wednesday while speaking at Utah Valley University.\n\nMeanwhile, Swift is a known liberal who has backed the last two Democratic Party candidates, in the 2020 and 2024 presidential elections.\n\nKirk even spoke about Swift a fortnight before his death, remarking on her recent engagement to tight end Kelce, 35. \n\n'This is something that I hope will make Taylor Swift more conservative,' he said, before adding that the singer should 'submit' to her future husband.\n\nKirk also controversially said the burly sportsman could 'de-radicalize' Swift from being 'a cat lady to a JD Vance supporter.'\n\nThe Giants teased Swift's attendance at the Sunday Night Football showdown at MetLife\n\nInstead they went on to show Lawrence Taylor, the Giants' Hall of Fame linebacker\n\nSwift is usually pictured cheering on from her suite, seen here with Brittany Mahomes \n\nFor her part, Swift is said to have been left in shock at Kirk's very public assassination. And it is that trauma, coupled with her ongoing issues of stalking, that has meant those around her are not 'taking any chances' when it comes to safety.\n\n'Taylor had concerns because she has received hate mail from the same kinds of extreme groups,' said another insider. 'Charlie's murder, and the weirdness with her stalkers, is why she will take serious measures to increase her security and only a core group of people know what her schedule is.\n\n'She was targeted by far-right extremist groups after going against Trump [by endorsing Kamala Harris] and there are legitimate concerns about some of the threats that have been made. They aren't taking any chances.'\n\nIn August last year, Swift found herself the target of a foiled terror attack in Vienna, Austria, and was forced to cancel three of her 'Eras' world tour dates in the capital. She later said the incident filled her with a 'new sense of fear.'\n\nSwift broke from tradition to sneak into the Arrowhead Stadium undetected last Sunday (pictured in September 2024)\n\nSources have claimed her mysterious entrance was a security measure after the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk (pictured) in Utah last week\n\nTerrifying real reason Taylor Swift hid behind that bulletproof screen: 'legitimate threats'\n\nIt came days after three young girls were tragically knifed to death while at a Taylor Swift-themed dance class in Southport, England.\n\nSwift has also found herself the target of multiple male stalkers.\n\nMost recently, she was granted a restraining order against Colorado man Brian Jason Wagner, who sent hundreds of emails and showed up at Swift's in Los Angeles multiple times.\n\nIn the wake of Kirk's death, there were a number of heightened security measures put in place at different sports events that high-profile figures attended. \n\nFor example, Trump visited the New York Yankees just 24 hours after Kirk's death to mark the anniversary of the 9/11 terror attacks.\n\nImages released before the game showed a row of three glass panels lined up next to each other in the stand. There were also snipers pictured overlooking the field. \n\nTravis KelceNew York\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nTaylor Swift skips Travis Kelce's Sunday night NFL showdown in New York amid recent safety concerns\n\nAdd comment","summary":"There was no sign of the global superstar at MetLife Stadium as Travis Kelce and the Chiefs looked for their first win of the season.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/nfl/article-15120827/Taylor-Swift-Travis-Kelce-NFL-New-York-safety-concerns.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/09/22/01/102178817-0-image-m-36_1758501776096.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-22 01:18:52","author":"Editor,James Cohen","authors":["Editor","James Cohen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.109},{"id":362387670,"title":"Why Sydney Sweeney and Scooter Braun's hot new romance could get them CANCELLED - if they don't turn on each other first","text":"Kim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Sep 22nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTearful Erika Kirk says she forgives Charlie's 'assassin' Tyler Robinson in devastating farewell at memorial\n\nNigel Farage vows to save taxpayers £230BILLION by sending back hundreds of thousands of migrants if Reform wins next election\n\nHamas claims 'victory' after Starmer hands out enormous 'prize for terrorism': Sir Keir is branded 'modern-day appeaser' after recognising Palestinian state despite Israeli and US fury\n\nDAN HODGES: With his formal recognition of Palestine, we now finally know what Keir Starmer actually stands for: Cowardice, appeasement, cynicism and deceit\n\nRevealed: The radical new therapy that can silence tinnitus and stop it in its tracks - before it becomes long term or even permanent\n\nTrump to warn parents everyday drug may trigger AUTISM... as officials hail breakthrough reversal treatment\n\nPrince Harry will NEVER be allowed to return as a 'half-in, half-out' working royal - and claims he could help ease William's workload are 'wide of the mark'\n\nI'm a 49-year-old beauty editor and menopause gave me hair loss and short, brittle locks that wouldn't grow.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk \nBy REBECCA LAWRENCE, ACTING DEPUTY SHOWBUSINESS EDITOR \n Published:01:03 BST, 22 September 2025 |Updated:02:15 BST, 22 September 2025 \n\nWhat a difference a few years can make. \nNo one knows this more than Sydney Sweeney and Scooter Braun - who not long ago were revered Hollywood figures. \nSydney, an all-American blonde bombshell, was lauded for her work on HBO's Euphoria, landing herself Emmy nominations and a string of brand deals. \nScooter too was at the top of his game, credited with launching the music careers of Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande and managing a range of high-profile artists. \nYet now the pair are arguably as synonymous with scandal as they are with their glittering careers. \nIndeed, Google now helpfully suggests 'cancelled' as an option when you search 'why is' followed by their names. \n\nWhy Sydney Sweeney and Scooter Braun's hot new romance could get them cancelled - if they don't turn on each other first (pictured at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding) \nFor Sydney its her politics that have come into question, with liberals sent into meltdown by the claims she has been 'secretly' harbouring MAGA views. \nWhile Scooter dared take on the wrath of the Swifties after taking ownership of the masters of her first six studio albums.\nSo a public fall from grace gives them some common ground. \nEven their meeting was controversial - with the pair being introduced at the wedding of billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and presenter Lauren Sanchez. \nThe ceremony - which had a $20million budget - was branded ostentatious by critics, with several protesters targeting the wedding. \nIn the three months that have followed, what started as 'casually dating' seems to have grown stronger, with friends stating the romance has quickly become serious.\nScooter is even said to have secretly joined Sydney on a getaway to Lake Tahoe this month - although he didn't feature in her swimsuit-clad snaps. \nHowever, there could be one big sticking point in the romance - politics. \n\nWhat started as 'casually dating' seems to have grown stronger, with Scooter said to have joined Sydney on a getaway this month - although he didn't feature in her swimsuit-clad snaps\nLast month, it was also revealed that Sydney was a member of the Republican Party of Florida, according to public voter records viewed by the Daily Mail. \nShe registered in Monroe County, Florida in June 2024.\nSydney skirted around the issue of politics in 2022, after she posted snaps of her mother's birthday party guests wearing MAGA-inspired hats.\nShe told GQ: 'Honestly I feel like nothing I say can help the conversation. It’s been turning into a wildfire and nothing I can say will take it back to the correct track.'\nIn contrast, Scooter is a Democrat, having hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton at his home in 2015. \nLast year, he endorsed Kamala Harris as he shared a gallery of snaps with the politician, saying he was 'proud' to call her his 'friend'.\nHe also called out Donald Trump after the President lashed out at Taylor Swift for endorsing Kamala. \nDespite their long-running feud, Scooter leapt to the singer's defence, sharing the message Donald posted on Truth Social - 'I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!' - and joking 'Shake it off Donald'.\nTaylor could also find herself dragged into Scooter and Sweeney's romance.\nScooter has long been hated by Taylor's fans after he purchased the hitmaker's musical masters in a deal reportedly worth more than $300million.\n\nLast month, it was also revealed that Sydney was a member of the Republican Party of Florida, according to public voter records viewed by the Daily Mail \n\nIn contrast, Scooter is a Democrat, having hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton at his home in 2015 (pictured with mayor Eric Adams in 2024) \n\nScooter also called out Donald Trump after the President lashed out at Taylor Swift for endorsing Kamala - despite his long-running feud with the singer \nIn the years since, Taylor very publicly battled against him, claiming that she had tried to purchase the masters herself but had not been given the chance, and accused him of 'incessant, manipulative bullying'. \nTaylor subsequently re-recorded several of her albums that she had lost the masters of, and, in May this year, she finally bought back the rights to all her music for a reported $360million.\nAs Scooter's romance with Sydney came to light, fans on X penned: 'Starting to wonder if rage baiting is Sydney Sweeney's new marketing strategy.\n'As someone who has been mildly amused and very impressed by Sydney Sweeney's ability to constantly p**s everyone off, it pains me to say that the Scooter Braun dating rumours have stunned me to silence. She finally got me.'\nLast year, Scooter announced his retirement from music management, saying he wanted to focus on his new role as a board member of Hybe and CEO of Hybe America.\nNews of his retirement followed on from losing clients such as Ariana Grande, Carly Rae Jepsen, and Demi Lovato.\nAriana's departure was first reported in August 2024 - the same month Demi and Scooter ended their contract as part of an 'amicable' agreement.\nAt the time, a separate source told DailyMail.com this was untrue, claiming that 'people are spreading rumors based on what they know, but they are off' in their speculation.\n\nScooter has long been hated by Taylor's fans after he purchased the hitmaker's musical masters in a $300million deal - and they've weighed in on his new romance \nJust hours after the news was revealed, Scooter poked fun at his professional predicament on Twitter.\n'Breaking news... I'm no longer managing myself,' he wrote.\nFollowing Demi's departure, reports then surfaced that Justin Bieber - who he discovered on YouTube in 2008 - was also leaving the music manager.\nBillboard dismissed the reports, confirming that Justin had signed a seven-year contract with Braun in 2020.\nWhile Scooter found himself losing clients, it appears Sydney has been losing friends. \nDuring the Emmy Awards this month, she appeared to have fallen out of favour with her fellow stars, with the Euphoria actress making a subdued appearance on the biggest night in television.\nWhile she took to the stage to present Owen Cooper with the Outstanding Supporting Actor award, Sydney was not pictured mingling with any of the celebrities backstage, nor was she seen at any of the afterparties.\nThe Anyone But You star has been on shaky ground after a huge backlash over her American Eagle denim campaign, which was branded 'Nazi propaganda' by critics.\n\nDuring the Emmy Awards this month, she appeared to have fallen out of favour with her fellow stars, with the Euphoria actress making a subdued appearance on the biggest night in telly \n\nThe Anyone But You star has been on shaky ground after a huge backlash over her American Eagle denim campaign, which was branded 'Nazi propaganda' by critics \n\nShe was swept up in a bizarre controversy after she appeared in an American Eagle denim campaign that had the tagline: 'Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans,' with critics claiming the ad was pro-eugenics and supported far-Right politics.\nIn one ad, the Anyone But You actress could be seen buttoning a pair of denim blue jeans while saying: 'Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality and even eye color. My genes are blue.'\nAnother clip filmed the star wearing a denim jumpsuit with a plunging neckline on the front as the camera panned down towards her chest.\n'My body's composition is determined by my genes,' she said, and then stopped to add, 'Hey, eyes up here.' The camera then jumped back up to her face.\nSome social media users slammed the campaign and labelled it as 'Nazi propaganda' while other fans branded the backlash as 'unhinged'.\nIt seemed the backlash only had a positive effect on the brand's profits, as figures published on Wednesday showed it has earned $1.28 billion since June.\nWall Street responded after the bell, sending the clothing store's stock price up 25 percent. The stock is still down 18 percent on the year.\nExperts previously told the Daily Mail that the contentious ad was intentionally attention-grabbing.\n\nSydney was previously engaged to businessman Jonathan Davino, 42, but the two split in January (pictured in 2018) \n\nScooter was married to South African–born Canadian health activist Yael Cohen for eight years. They share three young children and divorced in 2022 (pictured in 2020) \n\n What Sydney Sweeney's inner circle REALLY think of her new love Scooter Braun: ALISON BOSHOFF \n'From a PR perspective, what we're seeing from Sydney Sweeney isn't a \"misstep\"', Alexandria Hurley, a Las Vegas-based publicist, said.\n'Sydney has flirted with controversy before — from her SNL Hooters skit to her recent Bathwater Bliss collaboration with Dr. Squatch — and rather than walk it back after criticism, she's leaned further in. That's not oversight. That's strategy.'\nHowever, this strategy was no help when it came to ticket sales for Sydney's latest movies, which were both released in August.\nRon Howard's $50million-budget survival thriller Eden — debuted in 664 screens and earned just $1million.\nThe film's disappointing box office performance may be partly due to lukewarm reviews, despite a star studded-cast.\nSydney had a dramatic make-under for her role as the real-life German settler Margret Wittmer in the movie, which also stars Ana de Armas and Jude Law.\nMeanwhile, her film Americana, made only $500,000 on its opening weekend against a $9million budget, the weekend prior.\nSydney was previously engaged to businessman Jonathan Davino, 42, but the two split in January.\nScooter was married to South African–born Canadian health activist Yael Cohen for eight years.

We all were, and we’re here today to celebrate the way he lived his life and to remember the way he changed so many of ours. So, I want to start where I know Charlie would want me to, with what was most important to him, and that was his relationship with Christ,” Trump said at the beginning of his speech.\n\nWATCH — Beautiful! Thousands WORSHIP God at Charlie Kirk’s Packed Memorial:\n\n“To say Charlie knew more about the Bible than me is an understatement, folks. It’s like saying Donald Trump knows more about being president than Hillary Clinton or Kamala Harris,” he continued, pointing to an interview of Kirk where he said he would want to be remembered for his courage and faith.\n\n“And let me tell you guys, those were not empty words. Last week, Charlie joined a long line of courageous men and women who were martyred for what they believe. According to the book of Acts, the first martyr in the early Christian church was Stephen who was stoned to death. And as Stephen was being killed, he said, ‘Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.’ Now, there are many times in the Bible where Jesus is seated at the right hand of God, but this is the only time he’s seen standing. And while the Bible isn’t explicit about this, I like to think Jesus was standing to welcome Stephen, the courageous martyr, into heaven,” Trump said, explaining that it gives him great comfort because “11 days ago, as a cowardly assassin crawled on his stomach to end Charlie’s life on Earth.”\n\n“I’m betting Charlie saw the son of God standing tall to welcome him home,” he said, adding that Kirk “always brought out the best in all of us.”\n\n“At one of the last events of the 2024 campaign at Arizona State, some lunatic called in a threat to try to keep us from going on the stage again. We went out there anyway, without fear. Charlie led the way. His message was clear then, and his message is clear now. We won’t back down. … We won’t be intimidated,” he said, noting that the Bible repeatedly says to not be afraid.\n\n“And the 100,000 people here today are a signal to the world, our message of faith, family and country will not be silenced,” he added.","summary":"A relationship with Jesus was the most important thing to Charlie Kirk, Donald Trump Jr. said during the memorial service for the Turning Point USA founder.\n\n\nThe post Donald Trump Jr.: Relationship with Jesus Was the Most Important Thing to Charlie Kirk appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/09/21/donald-trump-jr-relationship-with-jesus-was-the-most-important-thing-to-charlie-kirk/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/09/AP25264771517668-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 23:05:21","author":"Hannah Knudsen","authors":["Hannah Knudsen"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.09},{"id":362395968,"title":"So you want to move to Canada, eh?","text":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\nLots of people say they’ll leave the United States if an election doesn’t go their way. The idea is simple: Find a government that matches your values—maybe universal health care—or, at the very least, get a break from the administration you loathe at home.\n\nAfter President Donald Trump’s 2024 win, those musings turned into action. CNN reported that Americans searching “move Canada” spiked to a 12-month high between Nov. 3 and 9. “How to move to Canada” peaked on Nov. 6, especially in deep-blue states like Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.\n\nIt’s not just Democrats who fantasize about fleeing. Ahead of last year’s election, The New York Times found Republicans plotting their own exits if Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won. One man, certain of Harris’ victory, said he’d be in Paris by the end of 2024. (Wonder if he unpacked his bags?)\n\nBut here’s the bigger question: Does moving abroad actually fix the problems you’re running from? Probably not, according to new data from the Pew Research Center.\n\nAcross 25 countries, majorities of adults in 20 say their nation's political system needs significant change or a complete overhaul. In the U.S., Argentina, Brazil, Greece, Kenya, Nigeria, and South Korea, around 8 in 10 adults think so.\n\nBut even among those demanding reform, optimism is scarce. In all but a handful of countries, sizable portions of the population are pessimistic about whether reform is even possible.\n\n“Political systems are designed to be complex and messy. Multiple parties express their preferences and then negotiate and attempt to reach a compromise,” Saskia Brechenmacher, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, told Daily Kos. “That’s the benefit of democracy—but it also creates numerous hurdles for action, making it harder to accomplish anything, particularly if the democracy is not functioning fully.”\n\nShe added that in younger democracies, elections alone aren’t enough if governments can’t deliver. \n\n“If that’s not combined with a state that can act, deliver services, build roads, fix the grid, and provide basic goods, it creates a lot of frustration,” Brechenmacher told Daily Kos. “Additionally, democracies around the world are also dealing with corruption scandals, which I believe further erode citizen trust.”\n\nSome countries express more faith in their leadership, according to a related Pew study. Large majorities of adults in Indonesia (80%), Mexico (78%), India (76%), and South Africa (63%) have a favorable view of their nation’s governing party. And in most countries Pew looked at, only about a quarter of adults or fewer hold negative views of both the main governing and main opposition parties. (Greece and Japan are exceptions, with majorities of adults in each expressing “double negative” views).\n\nMeanwhile, Pew found only five countries whose adults say their nation needs only minor tweaks, if any. That’s especially true in the Netherlands and Sweden, where about 7 in 10 say no significant changes are needed. Notably, both have public health insurance or similar protections.\n\n“The Netherlands and Sweden are two countries where there is a great deal of political power sharing,” said James Adams, a political scientist at the University of California, Davis. Coalition governments are common, he said, and that forces parties to cooperate. \n\n“The opposite of those systems are systems like the ones in place in France, Britain, and, to some extent, the United States, which feature these winner-take-all voting systems,” he said. “In those countries, you see a lot more political anger and much more public conflict.”\n\nIndeed, Pew found that many countries hold bleak views of their political parties. “People in many countries see at least one party favorably—but in 15 countries, no party we asked about gets positive ratings from a majority of adults,” the organization wrote. And that includes the U.S., where only 8% of adults view both major parties favorably. \n\nAdams argued that Americans are particularly angry because cultural issues—from LGBTQ+ rights to debates over immigration—dominate political life, leaving little room for compromise. \n\n“With economic issues, it’s easier to meet in the middle. But with cultural questions—whether gay marriage should be legal, whether transgender athletes should compete on teams that match their gender identity—it’s harder to do that,” he said. “That fuels distrust and makes people fired up.”\n\nAcross Pew’s survey, dissatisfaction isn’t just about partisanship. In the U.S., 53% of adults say few or none of their elected officials are honest, and 54% believe leaders don’t understand the needs of ordinary people. Similar distrust shows up in several Latin American, African, and many European countries—though Canadians, Swedes, the Dutch, and a couple others are largely more forgiving.\n\nMeanwhile, when it comes to views of political parties, Canada—the go-to escape fantasy for many Democrats—doesn’t look radically different from the U.S. In Canada, 39% have a favorable view of only the governing party, while 33% have a positive view of only the opposition party. But in the U.S., 32% like only the governing party, and 29% like only the opposition.\n\nThreatening to “move to Canada” might feel cathartic after a rough election night, but the data suggests that dissatisfaction with politics isn’t uniquely American—and you might not find the political paradise you’re dreaming of across the northern border.\n\n“Most people don’t know much about the politics of even their own country, let alone other countries,” said Matthew Singer, a political science professor at the University of Connecticut. “Why Canada? It’s close, you can speak English in most of the country, and it’s generally progressive. But Canadians are quite divided politically and geographically.”\n\nPew also looked at right-wing populist parties in 10 European countries. Most remain unpopular, but the organization finds that support is rising for many. Parties like France’s National Rally, Germany’s AfD, and Spain’s Vox have all seen gains in support recently.\n\n“A lot of those parties are anti-system, about tearing down existing institutions instead of reforming them,” Brechenmacher said. “The fact that those parties are becoming popular tells us something about the level of discontent that people feel with existing structures.”\n\nWhile it’s tempting to blame “the other party” or fantasize about starting fresh in a new country, dissatisfaction with politics is widespread worldwide. The U.S. stands out for its particularly low trust in elected officials and extreme polarization—but the desire to escape isn’t uniquely American. Pew’s data suggests that leaving may not give you the political reprieve you’re expecting. \n\nBefore booking that one-way flight, remember: The grass isn’t always greener on the other side of the border.\n\nAny updates?\n\n A new Washington Post-KFF poll offers one of the most explicit pictures yet of vaccine hesitancy among American parents—and who is driving it. Roughly 1 in 6 parents with kids under age 18 say they’ve skipped or delayed at least one routine childhood vaccine (excluding COVID and flu shots). Nine percent report skipping the MMR or polio vaccines, raising fears of renewed outbreaks of once-controlled diseases. Parents most likely to delay shots are homeschoolers (46%), white and very religious (36%), Republicans (22%), or under 35 (19%). The poll finds that concerns about side effects and doubts about the necessity of vaccines are the main drivers for skipping inoculations, not cost or access. And trust is low—and may be eroded even further with Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist, as the nation’s top health official. According to the poll, roughly half of parents say they lack confidence in federal health agencies to ensure vaccine safety.\n\n New polling finds that Americans are creeped out by the birthday card Trump allegedly sent to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The card features a silhouette of a woman’s torso drawn over apparent dialogue between the two men. “We have certain things in common, Jeffrey,” Trump reportedly wrote. “Happy Birthday—and may every day be another wonderful secret.” And a new YouGov/Economist poll finds that 61% of Americans say the card’s message is “disturbing,” compared with just 13% who consider it playful. Even among Trump voters, more find it disturbing (35%) than playful (25%), suggesting the card’s contents are crossing a line for people far beyond Trump’s critics.\n\n Far-right activist Charlie Kirk’s death has put his past words back in the spotlight—especially his claim that “some gun deaths every single year” are worth it “so that we can have the Second Amendment.” Most Americans disagree, though. A YouGov/Economist poll finds that just 30% agreed with Kirk, while 52% reject the idea. Even among Republicans, support isn’t overwhelming: 56% agree with Kirk, while nearly a quarter disagree.\n\nWith all the grim news out there, let’s end on a lighter note: What actually makes something a kids-only activity—and when is it fair game for adults to enjoy without guilt or judgment?\n\nA new YouGov poll put this to the test. According to Americans, some things are apparently off-limits for grown-ups: trick-or-treating (57%), playing with dolls (41%), and using bumpers while bowling (35%) are all considered strictly “for kids” (sorry, bad bowlers). \n\nOther activities are more of a gray area. Only 20% of adults say Legos are just for children. (As a Lego adult myself, I was relieved.) Dressing up in costumes is also deemed mostly for kids but still okay for adults to join in.\n\nAnd then there’s the weirdest result: crying. Seventy percent of Americans say it’s equally fine for adults and kids to cry, but 26% said crying is mainly or entirely for children, which is… bleak.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n\n\n\nLots of people say they’ll leave the United States if an election doesn’t go their way.

He urged his followers on X to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election, but he has donated to Republicans in the past.In a follow-up post on X, Graham said, \"If there's one thing history shows, it's that persecuting comedians who mock the head of state is always on the wrong side of history.\"He also said he'll be relieved not to have to overhear his kids watching \"The Family Guy\" anymore.","summary":"Y Combinator founder Paul Graham says he canceled his Disney+ subscription, joining fans boycotting the company over Jimmy Kimmel's suspension.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/paul-graham-y-combinator-canceled-disney-streaming-kimmel-suspension-2025-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/68d070ef183847aa39d730b2?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 22:32:22","author":"Lakshmi Varanasi","authors":["Lakshmi Varanasi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.315},{"id":362395970,"title":"Kat Abughazaleh’s punk-rock House bid","text":"The 26-year-old Chicagoan is betting that empathy and righteous anger can remake Democratic politics.\n\nBy Amanda Becker for The 19th\n\nIt is 2 p.m. on a Friday before a long weekend and as Kat Abughazaleh sits down at the tamales shop near her campaign office on Chicago’s North Side, she laments that the day has been so busy that she’d only managed to scrounge up a single saltine with some hot sauce.\n\nSaltines and hot sauce have become a go-to snack for the 26-year-old Democratic congressional candidate. Running for the House of Representatives has proven to be consuming, and the combo always seems to be on hand.\n\nAlready that day, Abughazaleh had woken up early for a therapy appointment (that she’d forgotten to schedule), taken her cat to the vet, arrived at the office for an all-day staff retreat to discuss their signature-gathering efforts to get on the ballot and participated in a photo shoot for this story. She updated her widely followed social media accounts along the way, teasing a forthcoming video that would highlight how the fight for workers’ rights in Chicago helped establish the imminent Labor Day holiday.\n\nThursday had been a late night — the campaign had hosted a punk show at a Wrigleyville bar. Punks for Progress featured three bands: Rude Echoes, The First Rule and Malört & Savior. In between sets, the local stand-up comedian Steve Tapas cracked that he knew the $5 he spent for the Abughazaleh campaign sticker on his drink cup “was not going to Democratic consultants” and blasted party leaders for being feckless when it came to standing up to Republican President Donald Trump.\n\n“What did you say? You didn’t like Chuck Schumer’s resistance? What? You don’t think the DNC, that took over $1.5 billion to lose the last campaign, is doing enough?” Tapas said to jeers from the crowd.\n\nThe vibe in the bar was righteous fury. Attendees in earplugs — available for free in the rear of the room, at the merchandise table — nodded their heads as Tapas said, “The price of eggs is $9 and my trans friends are scared to walk down the street.” They were dressed in “Tax the Rich” t-shirts, and in American flag pants, and in denim jackets with patches for the punk bands Minor Threat and Bikini Kill and another that urged “Protect Trans Youth.” There were songs about American imperialism and lyrics about how “nothing lasts forever, even one’s country.” There were reminders to tip the bartender, a military veteran. Special guest DJ Jayleigh, who spins for drag and burlesque shows, joined The First Rule on stage for their song “Dictator (We Elected A…),” written after Trump’s first election, when Abughazaleh was not yet old enough to vote.\n\nAbughazaleh wore a black leather jacket over a “Make Nazis Afraid Again” t-shirt, denim cutoffs, fishnet stockings and black high-heeled boots. Periodically, she would stop skanking — a type of moshing associated with ska music — and take the microphone to talk about affordable housing, groceries and health care, a trifecta she called “basic human rights.” She gleefully told the crowd that she had just texted a friend: “There’s a keffiyeh in the mosh pit!” She and members of Malört & Savior took shots of the band’s namesake anise-flavored liquor, infamous to Chicago.\n\nLooming over the event was Trump’s recent intimation that the city could be next on his list to send federal law enforcement. “Are we pissed the fuck off?” Abughazaleh called out. “Yeah!!!” the crowd responded. “Can I get a ‘fuck ICE!’ in here? Can I get a ‘fuck Trump!’ in here?” she continued.\n\n“This is not just about me getting into Congress — I don’t want to do this for the rest of my life,” Abughazaleh told them of her campaign. “I’m 26 and this is the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done, it is the most exhausting thing I’ve ever done. How do people do this for decades and decades? The conclusion I’ve come to is that they stop doing it right. And what we need right now is representatives that talk to people, that listen to them, that flex empathy like a muscle, and then leave this job … for the next generation.”\n\nWhen Abughazaleh launched her bid to represent Illinois’ 9th District on March 24, her 26th birthday, she joined a growing cohort of young Democrats who have concluded the stakes for democracy are so high — and the party’s old guard is so reluctant to give up power — that they need to push their way into the political arena, even if they are met with resistance.\n\nAt the time, the heavily Democratic district’s current representative, Jan Schakowsky, had not announced plans to retire, so Abughazaleh’s candidacy meant that she was challenging an incumbent who had held the seat since the year she was born, 1999. Abughazaleh explained that while Schakowsky was a reliably liberal vote in Congress, the last presidential election — when Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden on the ticket at the eleventh hour and ultimately lost to Trump despite raising and spending $1.5 billion in a whirlwind campaign — underscored the need for proactive generational change.\n\nAbughazaleh’s campaign slogan is a question: “What if we didn’t suck?” The “we” are Democrats. In a direct-to-camera launch video, she says, “Donald Trump and Elon Musk are dismantling our country piece by piece and so many Democrats seem content to just sit back and let them. So I say it’s time to drop the excuses and grow a fucking spine.”\n\nThough Trump’s approval rating is underwater and sinking, a series of opinion polls released over the summer also portend serious issues for Democrats as they attempt to take back control of the House, Senate or both in the 2026 midterm elections. Angry Democratic voters spent the summer at town halls pleading with their representatives to do more to counter Trump and his agenda. Pundits have started asking whether this is the Democrats’ “Tea Party” moment, likening it to the grassroots conservative takeover of the Republican Party in 2010 after the election of President Barack Obama.\n\nAbughazaleh explained that the question of Democratic succession is “less about age and more about the fact … that you’re legislating on ideas that are completely abstract to you as a person.”\n\n“Most of our members of Congress didn’t go through school shooting drills or didn’t have kids that went through school shooting drills; they don’t have to worry about out-of-pocket [health care] costs or paying rent because they own their house, and that’s good for them, but it makes it really difficult when you’re legislating about corporate landlords or about universal health care or about gun control,” she said.\n\nAbughazaleh’s path to being a congressional candidate has been as surprising to herself as much as to anyone else: She was supposed to be monitoring right-wing politicians for Media Matters for America, the liberal nonprofit newsroom where she got her first non-service industry job after graduating from George Washington University in 2020. But after Musk sued the organization over their reporting on antisemitism on his social media platform X, Media Matters was forced into layoffs and Abughazaleh lost her job. She joined her partner, Ben Collins, in New York City for a time and then did a stint freelancing as a “digital nomad” while she figured out how to leverage the large social media followings she had built across platforms. Her longtime bio on X, formerly Twitter, was: “I watch Tucker Carlson so you don’t have to.”\n\nWhen Collins moved to Chicago to become chief executive of the satirical newspaper The Onion, Abughazaleh saw it as a chance to explore another geographic “cornerstone” of her family. Abughazaleh’s maternal grandmother was a prominent GOP operative in Texas; she was raised in a household where President Ronald Reagan could do no wrong. She grew up in Dallas, spent summers in a tiny Colorado town and moved to Tucson halfway through high school. Chicago, though, was where her father spent much of his childhood. His own father settled there after fleeing The Nakba, an Arabic word meaning “catastrophe” that describes the mass, forced displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.\n\nAbughazaleh noted that she “could have, from day one, been like, ‘I’m a third-generation Chicagoan,’” to quash early criticism in the House race that she was a carpetbagger who had moved to the city just months before. “But I think that’s kind of toxic, how we look at politics, and I don’t think that should make someone vote for me. There are a lot of refugees in our own country that are coming here, whether it’s because you or your kid is trans, or you’re trying to protect your reproductive health,” she said, adding that once she starts trying to have children, for example, she won’t be comfortable spending time in Texas due to its restrictive abortion laws.\n\n“One of the cool parts of the campaign is learning specifics about my family history here,” Abughazaleh continued. “I knew my grandfather came here for college. He went to George Williams, when it was still in Hyde Park, then went back to the Middle East and opened the first Western-style supermarket in Kuwait. We have a lot of really cool volunteers who have kind of gone into archives. They found this picture of my grandfather in his yearbook … it’s like ‘Taher Abughazaleh, an ardent advocate for the rights of the people, reads his Quran in traditional costume.’”\n\nThe move to Chicago meant Abughazaleh was on the ground for last summer’s Democratic National Convention. She got credentialed as an independent creator to cover it. When it became clear that party leaders would not allow a Palestinian speaker as Israel’s war in Gaza raged on, dividing the party’s base, she joined a group of uncommitted delegates outside to protest. They slept there; the experience was overwhelming. “I heard slurs that I never heard before, aimed at us, and I am a Palestinian kid who grew up in Texas after 9/11,” she said. But there was also kindness: Colleagues at a podcast she was contributing to sent tea, coffee, nicotine and snacks.\n\n“I still had hope till the end of the DNC. I was, like, maybe there’s a chance to turn this around. And then they didn’t; she didn’t,” Abughazaleh said of Democrats and Harris. “Then a bunch of people who haven’t won an election in a decade or more came in and gave the same shitty advice that’s lost us elections unless we had a literal global pandemic.”\n\nOn election night, Abughazaleh went to bed early as Collins continued to watch returns. When she woke up briefly in the early hours of Wednesday and saw that it was shaping up to be a near clean sweep of swing states for Trump, she thought, “Fuck it, I’m going to run for something.”\n\nThen she went back to bed.\n\nIt took Abughazaleh several more months of tallying up what she thought was wrong in Democratic politics before she definitively decided to challenge Schakowsky. The final straw was watching party leaders at Trump’s inauguration, then, them “pushing through his fascist appointees.” She recalled thinking, “They’re not going to do anything, are they?” Sometime in February — “I don’t remember the exact breaking point, but there’s a note in my planner” — she told herself: “OK, I guess I’m running for Congress now.”\n\nBut she would run a very different type of campaign.\n\nAbughazaleh has focused on mutual aid and is using her campaign’s fundraising prowess to inject resources into the district. The price of “admission” to her launch event was donated menstrual products, which were given to an area shelter. Backpacks filled with supplies were stacked in a corner of the campaign’s office from a recent back-to-school drive. During the backpack drive, the campaign booked a popular barbershop for the day, providing $2,500 worth of free haircuts, mostly for kids. Sam Weinberg, Abughazaleh’s 24-year-old campaign manager, said he was drawn to work for her, despite not having traditional campaign experience, because of the “vision of the campaign she had,” which “wasn’t awful and soul sucking.”\n\nAmanda Litman, the co-founder and president of Run for Something, which supports young and diverse progressive candidates in state and local races, said that roughly 67,000 people have signed up to explore a run for office since the 2024 elections — more than during the entirety of Trump’s first term. About 80 percent are under 40 and the field slightly favors women. While Run for Something does not work with candidates for federal offices, Litman said she still gets a lot of email from people considering running for Congress, “and particularly about primarying Democrats.” She has spoken to Abugazaleh informally and is tracking her campaign, but is not advising her in any official capacity.\n\nLitman said the biggest spikes in interest that Run for Something saw were in the two weeks after Trump beat Harris; in February, after the first wave of firings of federal workers by Trump’s so-called Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE; when New York City progressive Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral primary; and in March, when Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer “caved” — Litman’s word choice — during a congressional standoff over a spending bill and worked with Republicans to avert a government shutdown. As another spending fight looms, liberal commentators are questioning whether Schumer and other leaders need to embrace more obstructionist tactics.\n\n“The thing we’re hearing that’s different this time around is that people are saying, ‘I’m done waiting for my turn,’” Litman said of the influx of candidates. “They’re particularly furious at the party leadership and they want to see that the leaders are as mad as they are.”\n\nShe said if you plot Democratic candidates on two axes, fight versus fold and transform versus return, in terms of the direction of the party, it’s “the people on the fight and transform, they’re breaking through.”\n\nAt the federal level, these candidates face real headwinds: Taking on an entrenched incumbent requires tenacity and economic resources. But it has been done before. In 2018, now-Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat then-Rep. Joseph Crowley of New York, who was seen as a potential successor to then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In the years since, she has built a national profile via her savvy use of social media and membership in the Squad, a group of progressive House lawmakers who are mostly women of color. They are a frequent target of right-wing media and politicians, while also sometimes playing the role of left-of-center antagonists to their own party. Their stances on national and international issues — a minimum wage hike, raising taxes on the wealthy, universal health care, the war in Gaza — carry immense weight with the Democratic base.\n\nOcasio-Cortez is now seen as a potential challenger to Schumer. Around the time that the minority leader canceled his book tour during uproar from Democratic voters about the government-funding battle, Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont packed tens of thousands into venues for their Fighting Oligarchy Tour. \n\n“AOC is absolutely an inspiration,” Abughazaleh said. “She created a permission structure for people like me to be able to run, and I wanna create a permission structure for even more people.”\n\nAbughazaleh pointed out, when drawing contrasts between herself and her Democratic primary opponents, that she comes into the race already having a sizable social media following and is likewise already accustomed to weathering attacks from prominent far-right figures — many of them virulently misogynist.\n\nRelated | Can Bernie Sanders train the next generation of progressive candidates?\n\nYoung candidates who, like Abughazaleh, are challenging their party’s status quo skew liberal. Beyond policy, they share the sentiment that their party elders did little to stop Trump’s rise and are ill-equipped now to contend with the far-right forces his movement unleashed. They reject the conclusion, after Democrats’ brief soul-searching following the party’s devastating 2024 loss, that Harris’ failure to respond to Trump’s attacks on her support of transgender people led to her defeat. (Rumored 2028 presidential hopefuls, including California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, have since publicly softened their support for transgender rights, specifically as it relates to playing sports.)\n\nThese young candidates make the case, in styles that range from angry to humorous, that it’s time for those in power to step aside from the broken system they have built and make room for a generation that has never experienced anything else, but insist a different, better Democratic Party is possible. They believe that showing they are willing to fight to protect vulnerable people’s rights, while offering an economic plan that appeals to the middle and working classes, isn’t an either/or but a both/and endeavor.\n\n“Trans people have kitchen tables. People that love trans people have kitchen tables. Immigrants have kitchen tables,” Abughazaleh said. “Democrats have been messaging on this issue, which is basic human decency, wrong this entire time. It’s a two-pronged thing. When it comes to extremism, if you’re constantly ceding ground that trans people don’t deserve to exist, or that there are carve-outs for that … it never stops with the people that you deem inhuman, it will always come to you.”\n\nAt a Pride Month event, Abughazaleh gave anti-LBGTQ+ protesters the middle finger during a clash, prompting outrage online from the political right. “Yes, I did flip off some bigots for telling children they’d go to hell and, no, I’m not going to apologize,” she said in a video response. The campaign designed a “Kat isn’t sorry” t-shirt with her image, middle finger raised. The shirt urges people to “stand up for trans kids.”\n\nAbughazaleh noted that the far-right uses a playbook of division so their attacks “resonate with people whose material needs aren’t being met.” She cited Russian President Vladimir Putin’s “war against queer people” as a modern-day example. She also pointed to how “when the Nazis came to power in Germany, one of the first things they did was burn down the library of gender and sexuality.”\n\nAbughazaleh does not accept corporate PAC money and has pledged to offer would-be constituents greater access to her, something her campaign is already doing with weekly “office hours.” During one such office hour in July, as she waited for her first guest to join, she fielded a question from the online chat about what she would do after serving her self-limited five terms. She immediately responded: “Hang out with Heater, obviously.” Heater is the cat Abugazaleh adopted with Collins last year after she gifted him a visit to a Brooklyn cat cafe, even though she is allergic to cats. She has embroidered Heater’s likeness on a pair of denim overalls. The orange cat is also depicted on a favorite set of earrings.\n\nAbughazaleh said that when she made initial calls about taking on Schakowsky, “I had people literally hang up the phone when I said there was an incumbent.” She saw it as further evidence of a broken system where you can “literally be blacklisted” by the party and deprived of its machinery and support. After Schakowsky, the incumbent, decided to retire, the 9th District’s primary grew crowded. The field now includes fellow front-runners Evanston Mayor Daniel Biss, a one-time Democratic gubernatorial challenger to current Gov. JB Pritzker, and state Sen. Laura Fine, who has name recognition but trails them both in fundraising.\n\nAbughazaleh joked that for a split second after buying tamales for herself and a campaign worker, she worried the charge wouldn’t go through because she was behind on submitting her expenses for reimbursement. She has been open about likely being one of the “poorest members of Congress” if she is elected, only recently secured health insurance and often talks about the “paywall” that keeps people out of politics. \n\n“I think that competitive primaries are great. If we win, I want someone to try a primary the next [cycle], because I think that if you truly are the best candidate, you shouldn’t be worried about a little competition,” she said.\n\n“When Biden was in power, it was like, ‘Well, we have to keep up a strong front, so you can’t challenge the party.’ And now that Trump’s there, it’s like, ‘Well, we have to show we’re united, so we can’t challenge the party.’ If now is not the time to challenge who is in power, when will there ever be a time?” she asked.","summary":"The 26-year-old Chicagoan is betting that empathy and righteous anger can remake Democratic politics.\n\n\n\nBy Amanda Becker for The 19th\n\n\n\n\nIt is 2 p.m. on a Friday before a long weekend and as Kat Abughazaleh sits down at the tamales shop near her campaign office on Chicago’s North Side, she laments that the day has been so busy that she’d only managed to scrounge up a single saltine with some hot sauce.\n\n\n\nSaltines and hot sauce have become a go-to snack for the 26-year-old Democratic congressional candidate.

US intel chief warns world is on the edge of annihilation\"The CIA just wants to blame ODNI all the time,\" the official said.White House defends Gabbard's security clearance actionsA White House spokesperson did not address whether there had been advance notice or when the emails were sent but said in a statement: \"Director Gabbard is doing a phenomenal job and the White House has worked closely with her on implementing the President's objectives.\"The entire administration is aligned on ensuring those who have weaponized their clearances to manipulate intelligence, leak classified intelligence without authorization, and many other egregious acts are held to account,\" the spokesperson said.Security clearance revocations target Russia investigation officialsRescinding security clearances was supposed to be part of an effort to correct what Trump's advisers view as flaws in intelligence assessments and to punish Trump's political enemies for allegedly mischaracterizing intelligence about Russian malign influence operations during the 2016 election.Gabbard said in the memo announcing the revocations last month that her actions were at Trump's direction and claimed that the people targeted were involved in the \"politicization or weaponization of intelligence\" to advance partisan agendas, or had leaked classified information.\"Being entrusted with a security clearance is a privilege, not a right,\" Gabbard wrote. \"Those in the Intelligence Community who betray their oath to the Constitution and put their own interests ahead of the interests of the American people have broken the sacred trust they promised to uphold.\"It was also in keeping with an executive order and followed the administration pulling security clearances for dozens of Trump's political adversaries including former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as other figures from Trump's first impeachment.Also read: Did White House post misleading video of Tulsi Gabbard over Iran's nuclear weapon amid her 'clash' with TrGabbard expected to face limited consequences despite tensionsGabbard is not expected to face significant ramifications over the episode, in large part because she has emerged relatively unscathed from other fraught moments, including when Trump in June publicly contradicted her assessment that Iran was far from acquiring nuclear weapons.\"I don't care what she said,\" Trump said in response to a question about Gabbard's testimony that Iran had decided not to make a nuclear bomb, shortly after she was notably absent from a key meeting at Camp David on the matter. \"I think they were very close to having it.\"Gabbard also drew Trump's ire when she posted a video in June warning of nuclear annihilation. Trump harangued Gabbard, saying it would scare people and that she appeared more engaged in self-promotion in order to set herself up for higher office, a person familiar with the matter said.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onTulsi Gabbard security clearancesDirector of National IntelligenceJohn Ratcliffe CIATrump administration intelligence communitysecurity clearance revocations\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

Tim Walz wasn't her top choice for running mate in the 2024 election.\n\nIn an excerpt from her upcoming memoir 107 Days published by the Atlantic, Kamala revealed that she was eyeing the then-Secretary of Transportation to be her vice presidential nominee. She wrote that Pete \"would have been an ideal partner — if I were a straight white man.\"\n\n\"But we were already asking a lot of America: to accept a woman, a Black woman, a Black woman married to a Jewish man,\" Kamala wrote, according to the Atlantic. \"Part of me wanted to say, Screw it, let's just do it. But knowing what was at stake, it was too big of a risk.\"\n\n\"And I think Pete also knew that — to our mutual sadness,\" Kamala added.\n\nWell, Pete responded. On Thursday, Pete told Politico that he was \"surprised\" to read that excerpt from Kamala's book, but believes in giving \"Americans more credit.\"\n\nAccording to Politico, Pete referenced how former president Barack Obama won Indiana in the 2008 election and his two terms as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, to support his perspective. \"You just have to go to voters with what you think you can do for them,\" he said. \"Politics is about the results we can get for people and not about these other things.\"\n\nPete told Politico that Kamala's concerns, which she addressed in her upcoming book, were \"not something that we ever talked about.\" But it seems like the internet really wishes they did.\n\nPeople had a lot to say about Pete's reaction in this Reddit thread, and they're not holding back on how they feel about giving America credit.\n\n\"'I believe in giving Americans more credit than that,'no offence but LMAOOOOOOOOOOO ok,\" one person wrote.\n\nSomeone else said, \"Hilarious that running with a gay man was risky but glazing the Chenneys and their 'legacy' was seen as a winning strategy though.\"\n\nThis person said, \"Americans don't deserve more credit than that. They haven't earned it. [Kamala] was right,\" and this person added, \"Harris is a realist and he's an idealist. She's right but I wish he was.\"\n\n\"Why would you possibly give more credit? This country is too scared to even have a woman president,\" one person said.\n\nAnd finally, someone said, \"With all due respect to Pete, come the fuck on. They elected that orange before they even elected a woman. It's time to live in the real world,\" followed by someone asking, \"Have you met our fellow Americans, Pete?

As per an expert, she criticised Biden’s decision to seek a second term as president, describing it as an act of “recklessness” that should never have been driven by “an individual’s ego.”\nSpeaking on Stephen A Smith’s SiriusXM show, Shapiro said he had not read her book, but Harris was going to have to answer for “how she was in the room and yet never said anything publicly,” according to the New York Post.\nShapiro was among a shortlist of candidates for VP under Harris before she picked Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, after Biden pulled out from the presidential race following a disastrous debate against Donald Trump in June last year. Shapiro said he conveyed his own concerns about Biden privately to his team.\n“I was direct with them. I told them my concerns,” he said, adding that his critique was framed around battleground stakes.\nKamala Harris On Shapiro\nIn her memoir, Harris argued that she remained silent during months of growing unease about Joe Biden’s age and political viability because of what she calls her “delicate status” as vice president. She said that she remained loyal but was also as a target of indifference from Joe Biden’s inner circle.\nShe said Shapiro was unusually focused on her shortcomings during vetting, as per the NYP. A spokesperson for Shapiro called those claims “simply ridiculous” and said the Governor was focused on defeating Trump, who went on to win the election.\nBiden, 82, was diagnosed with prostate cancer, which revived questions about what health issues the former US president was dealing with while he was in the White House. The former president had long sparked concerns over his mental health after a series of public gaffes.\nRepublicans argue that Biden, who ran for re-election as the oldest president in history, was physically unfit for office. The Trump administration seized on the cancer announcement and alleged a cover-up.","summary":"Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, who was considered for VP under Kamala Harris, said she would have to answer for not raising Joe Biden's health concerns publicly.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/pennsylvania-governor-warns-kamala-harris-says-shell-have-to-answer-over-joe-bidens-health-ws-kl-9587804.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/06/Kamala-Harris-2025-06-1321c78efd10f01efe5c00416bff1746.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 18:18:46","author":"Aveek Banerjee,News18","authors":["Aveek Banerjee","News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":362324430,"title":"Trump says Fox CEO Lachlan Murdoch involved in TikTok deal to control app’s algorithm","text":"Trump said on Sunday that multiple people are involved in the U.S.’s negotiations regarding TikTok, including Murdoch, Dell Technologies CEO Michael Dell, and Oracle Chief Technology Officer Larry Ellison.

And one is playing out in business right now.The first might be called the Direct Method: The government brings down the hammer of censorship by criminally prosecuting an individual or business directly for their speech. From World War I through the 1920s, laws like the Espionage Act authorized imprisoning activists and newspaper publishers who circulated anti-war ideas. Earlier, the Sedition Act of 1798 effectively made it illegal to criticize the sitting president, John Adams, resulting in the prosecution of at least 25 Americans.The second tradition of censorship could be called the Indirect Method, utilizing what First Amendment scholars sometimes call \"soft coercion.\" In this approach, the government leverages all the creative ways it can to punish speech peripherally — by withholding certain benefits, making regulatory tweaks, or tagging groups with toxic legal designations in national security or the tax code. This tradition came to define the McCarthy-era crackdown on Communist sympathizers, which reached its zenith in the 1950s.The suspension this past week of Jimmy Kimmel by ABC — at the apparent behest of FCC Chairman Brendan Carr — bears the features of soft coercion. Expressing displeasure at Kimmel's characterization of Charlie Kirk's assassin, Carr appeared on a podcast to announce that he would consider regulatory punishments for ABC if it didn't remove Kimmel from the air, before adding, \"We can either do this the easy way, or the hard way.\" ABC announced Kimmel's suspension hours later.What followed was a predictable ritual. As a nationwide chorus of political and business icons — from Barack Obama to Joe Rogan to former Disney CEO Michael Eisner — raised their voice in defense of free speech, MAGA partisans charged Democrats with bad faith, claiming that activists were merely being served their own medicine of \"consequence culture.\"Beneath MAGA's reversal is a point worthy of reflection. The First Amendment only prohibits censorship by government, not by private businesses. Nevertheless, corporations and universities, no less than government bureaucrats, can also practice soft coercion. \"Government is not the only thing that can make you unfree,\" Pete Buttiegieg observed when running for president — so can \"your neighbor,\" your \"cable company,\" and an employer. It's when these two forces conspire that the result, historically, spells trouble.The recruitment of private actors for government ends is the marquee feature of soft coercion. And in Carr's remarks, several scholars have identified the same DNA signature that came to define the Red Scare of the 1950s. \"This is clearly a case of unconstitutional threats and coercion of a private actor,\" Evelyn Douek, a professor at Stanford Law School who teaches the First Amendment, wrote by email. \"Like the McCarthy Era, the government is relying on private actors to carry out its speech repression on its behalf.\"In the 1950s, federal and state governments found creative ways to induce private institutions — Hollywood studios, unions, and universities — to purge or blacklist unwanted speakers. Less appreciated, but no less vast, was the pressure campaign waged on private industry. As historian Ellen Schrecker describes in her book \"Many Are the Crimes,\" the country's corporate behemoths in manufacturing and engineering — GE, Bethlehem Steel, RCA, Lockheed, General Motors, and others — were enlisted to cooperate with FBI and Pentagon loyalty screening programs, effectively monitoring the political views of thousands of employees.While some executives resisted somewhat, such as those at Ford, the overwhelmingly majority complied. The auto giants, particularly dependent on government defense contracts, were among the most galvanized by threats of investigations or lost business. GM officials repeatedly testified before Congress, required political loyalty oaths from unions, established a \"loyalty and security\" office, and preemptively fired workers flagged in reports by HUAC. In 1958, across all areas of employment, estimates suggest as many as one in five of Americans were subject to some form of loyalty review.In some respects, the second Trump administration's own efforts mirror this 1950s-era paradigm — not a Red Scare, but a Woke Scare. Under the auspices of reigning in far-left ideology, the administration has implemented a concerted crackdown on speech by foreigners (should they write an impolitic op-ed), private universities (should they fail to make ideological adjustments, like firing DEI staff), and law firms (should they advocate insufficiently for government-approved causes).As for broadcasters, Carr's rationale may be rooted in the First Amendment concept of \"government speech\": while it can't interfere with others' speech, government doesn't have to spend its money on speech it dislikes — and these are the government's licenses, after all. That argument, too, echoes 1950s-era tactics of soft coercion: Here, as then, the administration hasn't made it criminal to advocate left-wing causes, teach left-wing ideas, or litigate for left-wing clients — but if you do, you stand to lose your green card, your research funding, your security clearance, and now, your broadcast license. Corporate America has taken heed of this message, from Target rolling back its DEI policies, to Paramount paying Trump a $16 million settlement of his lawsuit over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris.While vast, the Trump administration's practice of soft coercion is also easily comprehensible. It follows three basic techniques — the Heckler's Veto, jawboning, and the use of vagueness — which collectively nudge or compel Americans and their employers to suppress certain types of speech on the administration's behalf.The first tactic is known as the \"Heckler's Veto\" — in which the government outsources the task of censorship to crowds of private citizens, then looks the other way while the mob wreaks havoc. This past week, while guest-hosting \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" Vice President JD Vance called on millions of Americans to take action. \"When you see someone celebrating Charlie's murder, call them out,\" Vance said. \"And hell, call their employer.\"It is bad morals to celebrate someone's murder. But it is bad civics for a head of state to enforce morals by punitive threat. The illegality of such a scheme would be obvious if Vance had made this request not of private citizens, but of the FBI. Vance's exhortation recalls the FBI's loyalty program but in reverse: a national snitch line, in which private citizens monitor their bosses. As Douek put it: \"The government is trying to use its power to force private actors to do for it what it couldn't do directly — suppress protected political expression.\"The second tactic is \"jawboning.\" The term refers to a strategy in which government officials improperly lobby a private actor to remove or censor third-party speech, often using vague or implied threats. Until recently, it was Democrats who had been tarred with jawboning. In 2024, a federal court ruled the Biden administration had inappropriately pressured Facebook and Twitter to combat vaccine-related and other misinformation. Carr's implied threat to ABC maps with laser precision onto the same jawboning offense.The third and final tactic of soft-coercion censorship is the use of vagueness. Instead of writing laws that articulate clearly what speech is banned, a purposefully vague law (or executive order) leaves doubt as to what speech is legal and which is criminal. Amid this confusion, citizens come to live under perpetual uncertainty that their speech — the next text, tweet, or Slack message — might or might not invite the wrath of criminal prosecution. Vagueness is a First Amendment violation because of its unusual power to achieve widespread self-censorship not by fiat, but doubt — the origin of the concept of \"chilling\" speech.Vagueness appears to be the cornerstone of the administration's censorship strategy — the entirety of which could be conceived as one massive, rolling vagueness violation. Consider two recent examples: A $15 billion lawsuit against The New York Times for defamation (dismissed this week by a federal judge as \"improper and impermissible\"), and an executive order banning flag burning (a black-letter First Amendment violation). But why bring lawsuits and executive orders that can't be enforced?These maneuvers have been described as clear attempts to make Trump's dissatisfaction plainly understood. In reality, the censorship campaign is in many ways seemingly intended not to be understood — designed not to clearly prohibit speech but instead invite the question whether it is. Trump strikes a bargain with law firms, for example, but the agreements aren't publicly written down, and no one publicly knows who has agreed to what. Trump bans the Associated Press from the White House grounds for using the phrase \"Gulf of Mexico,\" but grants access to other outlets that use the same phrase, leaving lawyers to speculate about Trump's motives in court. Even Carr's comments this past week resound in the Kafkaesque, accusing ABC of a vague failure to serve \"the public interest.\" These lawsuits and executive orders serve a similar purpose: to signal loudly that it doesn't credit the First Amendment rules we have come to accept as ironclad — and to invite the next journalist, or activist, to think twice about which free speech guarantee he might discard next.\"Unlike the McCarthy Era, the list of views that are on the forbidden list is much longer and more amorphous and growing every day,\" observes Douek. \"This is not just about suppressing Communism, for example — it seems like it has become dangerous to criticize the government or its allies in general.\"There is one crucialremaining factor that explains the success of Trump's soft coercion: the fecklessness of the institutions — law firms, universities, broadcasters — that have capitulated to it, sometimes with remarkable speed. With this phenomenon, we are reckoning with the casualties of a tragic misadventure that continues to haunt our public life: the abject failure of mainstream Democrats over the last decade to passionately defend free expression as a matter of first principle. By acquiescing to progressives who believed otherwise, the liberal and conservative custodians of these institutions weakened the resolve of their leaders to learn the vocabulary of liberal resistance. Inadvertently, then, they softened the institutional terrain for MAGA's eventual Viktor Orban-style conquest today. It takes years to become proficient in the customs of capitulation — to become acclimated to incessantly kowtowing to offended mobs, for instance, and bending to political whims. In American institutions' 10-year course in political submission, in other words, the left was their first teacher.Now, as people begin building a renewed case for free speech, they should keep two principles in mind, both drawn from the lessons of the 1950s. The first comes from Arthur Koestler. \"You can't help people being right for the wrong reasons,\" the Austro-Hungarian journalist said in 1949. In the coming months, left-wing activists will find themselves making points about free expression that match verbatim the past words of Tucker Carlson and Andrew Tate — a fact they must be prepared to credit and embrace. Anything less, warned Koestler, will poison their cause with the most lethal affliction any argument can suffer: \"Lack of self-confidence.\"The second principle comes from Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas. In 1951, Douglas immediately identified the threat of soft coercion, warning that America would soon \"enter dangerous territory to the liberties of every citizen.\" He also articulated the phenomenon that explains the First Amendment's political staying power: the confidence — faith, really — in the reasoning powers of the American public, and the inherent esteem it conveys toward one's countrymen. Famously, Douglas pronounced a \"confidence in the ability of our people to reject [the] noxious,\" whether in literature, theology, or politics. Today, a coalition of Americans must find a way to project certainty in the reasoning capabilities of every American: a new kind of public faith. This will remain true even if that certainty is later proven to have been tragically misplaced. That is, after all, what faith requires.Benjamin Wofford has written for Wired, Politico Magazine, Vox, and Rolling Stone, and is a graduate of Stanford Law School.","summary":"The three main ways the Trump administration is cracking down on speech.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/beyond-jimmy-kimmel-trump-soft-pressure-silencing-business-2025-9","image":"https://i.insider.com/68cc6418f9db348adc0bc305?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-21 15:05:50","author":"Benjamin Wofford","authors":["Benjamin Wofford"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.079},{"id":362306404,"title":"Trump pushes back on Harris’ book claim he privately praised her as a 'tough, smart customer'","text":"President Donald Trump rejected former Vice President Kamala Harris’ claim in her new book that he privately praised her during a concession phone call, saying he was cordial but never described her as a \"tough, smart customer.\" \"[I didn't call her that] that I know of, but I was nice to her,\" Trump told Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Doocy, co-host of the new program, \"The Sunday Briefing.\" Trump sat down with Doocy for an exclusive interview for the show's debut episode, where he addressed the excerpt explored in a New York Times review of Harris' new book, which chronicles her 2024 campaign run.
