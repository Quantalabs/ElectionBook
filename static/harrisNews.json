Ukraine launched more than 100 drones at Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula early on Saturday, local time, which Russia's defence ministry said had been shot down. The strikes set an arms depot on fire just kilometres from one struck by Ukrainian drones earlier this week, in an attack that wounded 13 people and also caused a huge blaze. Ukraine's General Staff said on Saturday \"at least 2,000 tons\" of weaponry, including missiles supplied by North Korea, were destroyed in a night-time drone strike that targeted depots in Russia's south and north-west. Russian authorities temporarily closed a 100km stretch of a highway and evacuated passengers from a rail station after a blaze caused a series of explosions near the town of Toropets, in the Tver region. Posts on local Telegram channels said a missile depot was struck. Unverified images circulating on Telegram on Saturday showed a large ball of flame rising into the night sky and dozens of smoke trails from detonations. Also on Saturday, an ammunition depot and missile arsenal in the southern Russian region of Krasnodar also caught fire and caused a series of blasts, triggering evacuations near Tikhoretsk. Authorities later announced a state of emergency around the town. Videos on social media showed bright orange clouds rising over the horizon and Russian state media described clouds of smoke above two sites near Tikhoretsk. Regional officials in both provinces attributed the blazes to falling shrapnel from drones downed by Russian air defence. There were no immediate reports of casualties in either region. Earlier in the week a separate military depot was struck by Ukrainian drones in Toropets itself, which was described by the UK defence ministry as \"one of Russia's largest strategic ammunition depots directly supporting its operation in Ukraine\". In its latest intelligence update, the ministry said that strike, reported on Wednesday, likely caused \"enormous losses of ordnance\". The update, posted on X, referenced reports of North Korean missiles being stored at Toropets, but did not independently confirm it. Boy killed in Ukraine In Ukraine, a 12-year-old boy and two older women were killed as Russian missiles overnight struck Kryvyi Rih, Mr Zelenskyy's hometown in central Ukraine, local Governor Serhii Lysak reported on Saturday. Mr Lysak said the missiles hit \"in the middle of the night, when the city slept\", wounding three more people, destroying two buildings and damaging another 20. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, 15 people including young teens were wounded by Russian air strikes on Friday evening, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said. Shortly after the strike, Mr Terekhov said seven civilians, including three children, were hurt after Russian Su-34 fighters dropped guided precision bombs on three Kharkiv districts. Russian drone and artillery strikes on Saturday also wounded at least three civilians in Ukraine's southern Kherson region, local officials reported, while a fourth was wounded after an air strike hit the northern city of Sumy. Zelenskyy's 'victory plan' Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy appealed for quick action from the United States to send more weapons before his visit to the White House next week with a multi-point \"victory plan\". This plan will include long-range strike capabilities and other weapons long sought by Kyiv, along with serving as the basis for any future negotiation with Russia, Mr Zelenskyy told reporters. Mr Zelenskyy has regularly alluded to the plan's preparation, but has not publicly outlined its contents, saying only that it contains terms acceptable for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia. \"This will be the start and foundation for talking in any format with Russia. In any format, with any of its representatives, because there will be a plan and something to show,\" he said in a briefing on Friday. He said US reluctance so far to allow the use of Western weapons in Russian territory stems from fears of escalation with Moscow, a major global nuclear power. But the longer Western partners wait to green-light long-range missiles, the more tactically obsolete their value would become, he added. Ukraine has had to use its own capabilities to conduct strikes inside Russia. Mr Zelenskyy's remarks came shortly before he kicks off a busy week in the US shoring up support for Ukraine. He is expected to address the UN General Assembly annual gathering in New York and travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris. Ukraine's Western backers have routinely been criticised for only helping the country to survive the invasion, rather than win, out of concern for the chaos that it might cause in Russia should Vladimir Putin fall. The victory plan could be an attempt to change that calculus. Beyond making demands of Mr Biden, Ukraine is likely to seek detailed commitments from European allies as well, with Mr Zelenskyy saying \"a number of actors\" between October and December would help Kyiv make headway.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Terry Zeller and Justin Enriquez For Dailymail.com Published:01:20 BST, 22 September 2024 |Updated:01:39 BST, 22 September 2024 e-mail View comments Photos of Jennifer Lopez in bed with her ex Diddy have resurfaced following the disgraced rapper's recent arrest. Diddy, 54, was taken into custody in New York on Monday as part of a sex trafficking investigation and is currently held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center. Denied bail, he has been placed on suicide watch after being indicted for sex trafficking, racketeering, and prostitution-related charges. Amid the controversy, a viral image from Diddy's 2000 Fourth of July party shows him in bed with Lopez and the late R&B icon Aaliyah. Also pictured were late record executive Andre Harrell, model Natane Adcock, and Damon Dash. Photos of Jennifer Lopez in bed with her ex Diddy have resurfaced following the disgraced rapper's recent arrest Amid the controversy, a viral image from Diddy's 2000 Fourth of July party shows him in bed with Lopez, late R&B icon Aaliyah, late record executive Andre Harrell, model Natane Adcock, and Damon Dash among others Read More Diddy's longtime partner Cassie remains silent amid his indictment over shocking charges The attendees beamed with smiles as they relaxed on the oversized bed, appearing to cozy up next to one another. At the time, JLo and Diddy were still a couple, having dated from 1999 to 2001. The resurfaced images come after a clip of her mother becoming furious after being asked if a romantic reunion with Diddy was a possibility went viral after his sex trafficking arrest. Back in 2015, Jennifer appeared on The Wendy Williams Show with her mother Guadalupe Rodriguez in the audience. Talk show host Wendy was curious if there was any possible reconciliation on the horizon at the time as she said: 'So if you recall, the last time you were here I was telling you that I could always see you getting back with Puffy in a little way.' JLo laughed and shook her head while Wendy shrugged but it was Guadalupe's reaction which was the most eyebrow-raising. The audience could be heard reacting as the camera cut to the A-lister's mother in the audience as she furiously looked toward her famous daughter and shouted 'no!' while doing a 'cut it' hand gesture. The clip resurfaced on X (formally Twitter) after Diddy's arrest as a user wrote 'Some of y'all didn't catch JLO's mom reaction when Wendy Williams said this.' JLo and Diddy dated for two years before splitting in 2001; they are pictured together in February 2000 The disgraced music artist was arrested on Monday in New York amid a sex trafficking probe and is currently being held at Brooklyn's Metropolitan Detention Center; seen in 2002 Conan O'Brien interview This comes after Diddy was seen making a joke about locking women up at parties in a resurfaced Conan O'Brien interview that took place 22 years earlier. A 2002 interview of Diddy on Late Night With Conan O'Brien has now resurfaced and gone viral as he made comments about having 'locks on the doors' to prevent women from leaving parties. While giving tips on how to put on a 'killer party,' Combs said, 'This is what you need to do. Women. Beautiful women, of course. Beautiful men for the ladies, of course.' He continued to give a checklist to throw a bash, such as needing 'alcohols' and 'some water.' When Conan questioned why water was on the list, Diddy said, 'I don't know if guys have noticed this, like, a lot of ladies drink water at parties. They just, you know, so if you don't have what they need, they're gonna leave.' 'Gotta keep them there,' he continued. 'You need locks on the doors.' Combs was arrested by Homeland Security officials at the Park Hyatt hotel in midtown Manhattan, and on Tuesday a judge ordered him to be held without bail. At the center of allegations against Diddy are so-called 'freak off' sessions where the rapper would allegedly coerce and drug women into performing lengthy sexual marathons. Meanwhile, Lopez, who recently filed for divorce from Ben Affleck, was seen on a shopping spree in Beverly Hills on Saturday but has remained silent about her ex's arrest At the time of the 4th of July photo, JLo and Diddy were still a couple, having dated from 1999 to 2001 The shopping spree follows a recent reunion with her estranged husband Ben Affleck, marking their second meeting in just a week The arrest of Diddy came approximately six months after federal authorities raided his homes in Los Angeles and Miami. In those raids, prosecutors said agents found over 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant that were alleged to have been used in his infamous 'freak offs.' Authorities said they have interviewed more than 50 witnesses and associates, and their raids included the seizure of a trove of laptops, cell phones and hard drives. Lopez is reportedly ' trying to be friendly' with her Affleck for the sake of their kids Jennifer and Ben originally met on the LA set of Martin Brest's box office bomb Gigli in 2001, but abruptly split just three days before their wedding in 2004 They both moved on to marry others after their initial breakup, with Jennifer tying the knot with Anthony in 2004 and Ben marrying Garner in 2005 However, after the end of both marriages, the two rekindled their romance in 2021 Prosecutors also claim they are in possession of footage that they claim proves Diddy coerced and manipulated victims into taking part in lewd acts. Diddy's attorney Marc Agnifilo has argued in court this week that his client does not deserve to be lumped in with other high-profile figures accused of similar crimes, such as R. Kelly and Jeffrey Epstein. Speaking of the indictment, Agnifilo said: 'This is evidence, not of sex trafficking, but of being caught being unfaithful... He was in a 10-year loving relationship through dark periods.' Meanwhile, Lopez, who recently filed for divorce from Ben Affleck, was seen on a shopping spree in Beverly Hills on Saturday but has remained silent about her ex's arrest.

Biden, who U.S. officials say feels very close to Kishida, hosted him at his private residence in Wilmington, the president's hometown in Delaware, and praised the Japanese premier for being a \"visionary and courageous\" leader over the past three years. Biden noted Kishida's leadership has made it possible for Japan to fundamentally strengthen its defense capabilities and transform its role in world affairs, the White House said. \"The two leaders committed to sustain efforts to take the U.S.-Japan alliance to new heights and to continue standing side-by-side together as steadfast global partners,\" it said. Kishida and Biden, who both took office in 2021, each decided this summer not to seek reelection amid slumping public support in their respective countries. During the meeting, which took place hours before a four-way summit of the Quad grouping also involving the leaders of Australia and India, Kishida and Biden reviewed some of their joint accomplishments and candidly discussed common challenges facing Japan and the United States, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. In addition to confirming the importance of passing the robust alliance to future leaders, they discussed major foreign policy issues, including China's \"coercive and destabilizing activities\" in the South China Sea and other parts of the world, according to the White House and the ministry. They said the leaders also reaffirmed that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are essential and underscored their opposition to any attempts to change the status quo by force. Kishida agreed with Biden to continue supporting Ukraine and applying tough sanctions to Russia, as well as to deal with North Korea's evolving nuclear threats closely together and trilaterally with South Korea, according to the ministry. Kishida announced in August he will not run in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's presidential election, set to take place on Friday. Biden, who ended his bid for another four years in the White House in July, has repeatedly praised Kishida for significantly increasing Japan's defense spending amid the severe security environment in Asia. Despite the enduring conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, the United States continues to view China as its most consequential geopolitical challenge and the Indo-Pacific as a region of central importance for Washington's strategic interests. Under such circumstances, Japan is increasingly seen as an indispensable ally not only by the Biden administration, but also by a large majority of Democrats and Republicans. Nonetheless, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have opposed plans by Japan's Nippon Steel Corp. to acquire United States Steel Corp., siding with a powerful labor union based in a critical battleground state that could determine the U.S. presidential election in November. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee running against the Democrat Harris for the White House, is also against the Japanese leading steelmaker's proposed acquisition of the smaller U.S. producer, making the issue a delicate one between the two countries. Kishida stressed that Japan has contributed to the U.S. economy as the largest investor, while voicing hope to further strengthen bilateral cooperation, according to the ministry. But it remains unclear if either of them touched on the buyout plan during the meeting that lasted about an hour. On many occasions, Biden has hailed Kishida's strong commitment to support Ukraine and consistent efforts to warn that \"Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,\" which has drawn global attention to the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Biden invited Kishida to Washington as a state guest in April, during which he said the alliance has been transformed into a \"truly global partnership\" during their tenures and announced a long list of agreements with the prime minister. The agreements, focused on boosting the alliance's deterrence and facilitating its networking with like-minded partners, included working toward more integrated command and control structures between Japanese and U.S. forces.

The other shadow hanging over the summit was November's US presidential election, with the isolationist former president Donald Trump in a tight race against Biden's political heir Kamala Harris. Biden insisted that the group would survive whatever the political situation. \"While challenges will come, the world will change because the Quad is here to stay,\" Biden told the leaders in his public remarks before journalists were ushered out. Asked by reporters if the Quad would make it past the Nov 5 election, Biden replied: \"Way beyond November. Way beyond November.\" \"HERE TO STAY\" India's Modi made a similar pledge - in a commitment that will be welcomed by Washington, Canberra and Tokyo as they court the historically non-aligned New Delhi. \"Our message is, the Quad is here to stay,\" said Modi, who is due to host next year's Quad summit in India. Biden, who bowed out of the US presidential election in July after concerns about his age, filled his farewell summit with personal touches. The four-way summit took place at his former high school in Wilmington and he earlier opened up his home in the city for private, one-on-one talks with each of the leaders. \"I am really pleased that you were able to be in my home and see where I grew up,\" he said. The leaders also announced investment into fighting cervical cancer for Biden's \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative - again a deeply person project as his eldest son Beau died of brain cancer. The media were given no access to the private meetings at Biden's home. Biden posted pictures on social media of him with Albanese and then with Kishida in a wood-paneled drawing room in his house, and showing them the view of a lake from a veranda. The White House said the summit reflected the way Biden prioritized international alliances. There are growing questions about what would happen if Trump -- who has threatened to pull the United States out of groups like NATO while praising the leaders of Russia and North Korea -- returns to the Oval Office.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/world/biden-hot-mic-china-testing-us-quad-allies-xi-jinping-4623541","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--xUbpqQF7--/c_crop,h_562,w_1000,x_0,y_65/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_one-cms:core:watermark:ap_data-1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/biden_quad_07521.jpg?itok=dB_nttgc","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 00:09:38","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":0.252},{"id":256947266,"title":"Janet Jackson Questions Whether Kamala Harris Is Black, Thinks Election May Bring ‘Mayhem’","text":"Janet Jackson appeared to question the fact that Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is Black. In an interview with The Guardian, which was published on Saturday, the reporter asked the pop star “where she stands on the forthcoming election,” with America “on the verge of voting in its first female Black president,” the author wrote. “Well, you know what they supposedly said?” she asked the reporter. “She’s not Black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian.” It appeared that she was not aware that Harris is both Black and Indian, which the reporter explained to Jackson. “Her father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days,” Jackson responded. “I was told that they discovered her father was white.” That is, of course, false. Harris’ father, Donald J. Harris, was born in Browns Town, Jamaica and grew up in Jamaica. Her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, was born in Chennai, India, and died in 2009. Harris’ parents divorced in 1971. As The Guardian points out, those who question Harris’ heritage “tend to be hardcore QAnon-adjacent, Trump-loving conspiracy theorists,” which the reporter concluded that Jackson was likely neither. And while it’s unclear who the specific “they” is who falsely claimed Harris is not Black and that her father is white according to Jackson, the reporter pondered where Jackson might be gathering this misinformation. Back in July, GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump claimed he didn’t know Harris is Black. “I’ve known her a long time indirectly,” Trump said during an appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists. “She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. I didn’t know she was Black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn Black.” He added: “She made a turn, and she became a Black person, and I think somebody should look into that,” appearing to imply she “became a Black person” for political gain. The Guardian also asked Jackson if she believed America was ready for Harris. “Honestly, I don’t want to answer that because I really, truthfully, don’t know. I think either way it goes is going to be mayhem,” Jackson said.","summary":"In an interview with The Guardian, pop star appears to parrot misinformation Trump and others have spread","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/janet-jackson-kamala-harris-black-election-mayhem-1235108774/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/JanetJackson-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 00:07:20","author":"Althea Legaspi","authors":["Althea Legaspi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.375},{"id":256947752,"title":"US presidential candidate Donald Trump conceded that another debate would have 'good entertainment value'","text":"US presidential candidate Donald Trump conceded that another debate would have 'good entertainment value' | National News | guampdn.com Skip to main content You have permission to edit this image.

Jackson, 58, made the shocking assertion in an interview with The Guardian, when asked on her feelings about the United States having its first female black president. ‘Well, you know what they supposedly said?’ the singer answered. ‘She’s not black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian.’ ‘Her father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white.’ Harris, 59, was born in 1964 to Dr Shyamala Gopalan, an Indian-born cancer researcher, and Donald J. Harris, a black Jamaican economics professor. The couple wed in 1963 and separated in 1971, after welcoming Kamala and her younger sister Maya, 57. Gopalan died of cancer in 2009 aged 70, while Donald Harris, 86, is now a professor emeritus of economics at Stanford University after retiring in 1998. Jackson’s late brother Michael faced controversy about his skin after it changed color from black to white over the course of his career. He blamed a medical condition called vitiligo and denied bleaching his skin. And the Nasty singer’s false claim about Harris being half-white has been compared to one of Donald Trump’s most notorious claims during the presidential campaign. Trump claimed Harris ‘happened to turn black’ while addressing a the National Association of Black Journalists’ convention in Chicago in July. He said: ‘She was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage. ‘I didn’t know she was black until a number of years ago, when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black. ‘So I don’t know, is she Indian or is she black? ‘I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden she made a turn and she went – she became a black person. I think somebody should look into that too.’ Harris shrugged off the remarks days later accusing Trump of ‘the same old show, the divisiveness and the disrespect.’ She added: ‘The American people deserve better.’ The vice president has yet to comment on Jackson’s remarks about her race. Trump’s comments on Harris race outraged many conservatives, with even his own supporters said to be annoyed at the former president for not focusing on attacks on Harris’ policies. Earlier this month, Trump appeared to double down on his comments about Harris’ race. ‘I don’t care what she is. I don’t care. Whatever she wants to be is okay with me.’ Polls show that the race between Trump and Harris remains on a knife edge ahead of election day on Tuesday November 5.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJanet Jackson has claimed that Kamala Harris is not black &#8211; and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Janet Jackson shockingly reveals something about Kamala Harris that echoes one of Trump&#8217;s infamous remarks about the VP first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/janet-jackson-shockingly-reveals-something-about-kamala-harris-that-echoes-one-of-trumps-infamous-remarks-about-the-vp/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Janet-Jackson-makes-jaw-dropping-claim-about-Kamala.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-22 00:01:25","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":256947618,"title":"Watch: President Biden places hand on PM Modi's shoulder as he answers question on Quad survival","text":"Placing his hand on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s shoulder, President Joe Biden reaffirmed to the Quad members that the alliance would endure 'way beyond November', addressing concerns about its future after the US elections.The 2024 US Presidential Election is set for November 5, 2024.

When Mr. Biden began his presidency he looked to elevate the so-called Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend’s summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. “It will survive way beyond November,” Mr. Biden declared as the leaders gathered at the Archmere Academy, his high school alma mater in nearby Claymont for joint talks. Biden hosts leaders at his Wilmington home and high school alma mater The president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner. “I don’t think the headmaster of this school thought I’d be presiding over a meeting like this,” Mr. Biden joked to fellow leaders. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. “This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,” said Kishida, who like Mr. Biden, is set to soon leave office. Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. Kishida, according to the prime minister’s office, thanked Biden at the outset of their meeting for inviting him to meet at his home. White House officials said holding the talks at the president’s house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan described the vibe of Mr. Biden’s one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as “two guys — one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.” He said Mr. Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him “insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.” Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Mr. Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks at Archmere. “There cannot be a better place than President Biden’s hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,” Modi said. Reporters and photographers were prohibited from covering Mr. Biden’s individual meetings with the leaders, and Biden does not plan to do a news conference — a question-and-answer appearance that is typical at such international summits. What Biden hopes to accomplish with the summit As part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. Mr. Biden and Modi had been expected to discuss Modi’s recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sullivan said “that countries like India should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity” and that “every country, everywhere, should refrain from supplying inputs to Russia’s war machine.” The gathering was also an opportunity for Mr. Biden and Japan’s Kishida to bid each other farewell. Mr. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The two leaders sat down for their wide-ranging, one-on-one conversation on Saturday morning. The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and increasing Chinese assertiveness. Mr. Biden commended Kishida for demonstrating “courage and conviction in strengthening ties” with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China’s “coercive and destabilizing activities” in the Pacific, Russia’s war against Ukraine and emerging technology issues. Tension surrounds Nippon Steel’s proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel The U.S. and Japan are negotiating through a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Mr. Biden, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the two candidates in the 2024 presidential election, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel. Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee’s formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the Nov. 5 election. Sullivan pushed back against speculation that the expected timing of the report could suggest Mr. Biden is having second thoughts about his opposition to the deal. The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries. The White House said the leaders later Saturday will roll out a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific. The announcement is related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths. The Bidens’ son Beau died in 2015 at age 46 of brain cancer. As Mr. Biden’s time in office draws down, the White House also was celebrating the bipartisan, bicameral formation of a “Quad Caucus” in Congress meant to ensure the longevity of the partnership regardless of the outcome of the November election.","summary":"President Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown of Wilmington to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India as he hosted what is likely the last gathering of the Indo-Pacific partnership that has grown in prominence under his White House tenure.

The official added that Harris would welcome the opportunity to attend as president if she is elected in November. The decision was first reported by CNN. Donald Trump's campaign did not immediately respond to a question about whether he would attend the dinner. His 2016 appearance at the dinner invited boos when many in the audience felt he crossed a line when he called Democrat Hillary Clinton corrupt and claimed she hated Catholics.This year's white-tie gala is scheduled for Oct. 17.Cardinal Timothy Dolan, who plays a prominent role in the dinner, has been highly critical of Democrats, writing a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed that carried the headline, \"The Democrats Abandon Catholics.\"The Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner is named for the former New York governor, a Democrat and the first Roman Catholic to be nominated for president by a major party in 1928. He was handily defeated by Herbert Hoover. It raises millions of dollars for Catholic charities and has traditionally shown that those vying to lead the nation can get along, or pretend to, for one night.The event has become a tradition for presidential candidates since Richard Nixon and John F. Kennedy appeared together in 1960. In 1996, the Archdiocese of New York decided not to invite then-President Bill Clinton and his Republican challenger, Bob Dole, reportedly because Clinton vetoed a late-term abortion ban.Trump and then Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who is Catholic, both spoke at the fundraiser in 2020, when it was moved online due to concerns about large gatherings spreading COVID-19. Amid the pandemic and economic woes, there was no joking and both candidates instead used their speeches to appeal to Catholic voters.Mr. Biden, who is Catholic, has not attended since he took office. In 2016, Trump began innocently enough. He joked that then-Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer used to love Trump when he was a Democrat. He poked fun at plagiarism involving the Clintons.

Her speech writer Ronald Millar recalled leaning forward moments before Margaret Thatcher went to the rostrum with words of encouragement. “Piece of cake, prime minister,” he whispered, only to be rebuffed with “not now Ronnie, I’m about to deliver my speech”. The Liberal Democrats only came third in the general election but Sir Ed Davey‘s conference in Brighton last week was one long triumphal rally, complete with 72 Lib Dem MPs and an ABBA singalong. Surely this Labour conference in Liverpool is set to be an even greater celebration. Sir Keir Starmer has just delivered a stunning victory that catapulted Labour straight into government after 14 years of opposition. He is in illustrious company – not many leaders of either main party have done that. There have been 21 in the past 60 years but only five – Harold Wilson, Ted Heath, Margaret Thatcher, Tony Blair, and David Cameron – have faced their first conference as prime minister fresh from turning the tables decisively against their political foes. For all the habitual nervousness of party leaders about their big speech, Sir Keir’s first set-piece speech as prime minister to his party conference this week in Liverpool really might have been expected to be “a piece of cake”. He has not been so lucky. Sir Keir is under pressure within his party and with the public before he opens his mouth. Read more politics news:Jenrick claims England’s national identity is at riskRow over PM’s freebies ‘not important’, minister says Just 80 days into office, there is no honeymoon for Labour. The leader already has ground to make up. Sir Keir and his allies have devoted their energies to blaming the last government successfully for the rundown state of nation. The prime minister has emphasised that things will get worse before they get better so determinedly that many of his party believe there is an urgent need to lift the gloom. Things are not going well. Labour MPs are in sullen mood having been whipped to vote for continued restrictions of child benefit and to abolish winter fuel payments for most pensioners. Sir Keir is under personal attack for being parliament’s biggest taker of gifts and freebies including designer spectacles, clothes for his wife and an executive box at Arsenal. Those working most closely with the prime minister, supposedly behind the scenes, are generating headlines by purportedly briefing viciously against each other. Both Labour and Sir Keir’s popularity have gone down in opinion polls. In raw electoral terms this may not matter very much at the moment. Neither Labour nor Sir Keir were much liked at the election, but 33.7% of the votes gave them a practically impregnable 63% of the MPs at Westminster, thanks to the electoral system and competition between numerous other parties. That should mean that the party will stay securely in power for the next four years come what may. Activists are already asking themselves what will happen then. Just to stay in power, they calculate that Labour is bound to need more solid support than it polled in July, not less. They want Sir Keir to lift the depression and give his audiences some hope for better times in his keynote address at 2pm on Tuesday. Ellie Reeves MP, the Labour Party chair, and the more bubbly sister of Chancellor Rachel Reeves, will try to set the tone for “hope” in her remarks at the official opening of the conference on Sunday. Sir Keir could look for inspiration from previous election winners at conference. Like Sir Keir last week, Harold Wilson had just returned from the glamour of the White House visiting Lyndon Johnson. He paraphrased flatly from the assassinated John F Kennedy’s inaugural address: “Whatever our role in industry, our approach must be not what we can take out of the national pool, but what we can put into it.” Neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris have yet come up with a resounding soundbite worth borrowing. Besides, Sir Keir is unlikely to be as bold, and undiplomatic, as the Lib Dem leader and say that he can’t wait for Ms Harris to beat Mr Trump. Several other newly victorious prime ministers have used the occasion to give their party and the country a pep talk about what was expected from them. In 1970 Ted Heath talked about the long task of laying the foundations for future Conservative governments. In 1979, Mrs Thatcher’s closing words were: “You gave us your trust. Be patient. We shall not betray that trust.” On recent form Sir Keir will find it easy to slip into this stern mode. Unlike John Major, or all the Tory prime ministers since Theresa May, Sir Keir does not have to explain away the mistakes made by his own party in government. Mr Major’s victory in 1992 kept the Conservatives in power only for the economy to be hit months later when the pound crashed out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism. Mr Major opted for rueful humour: “Well it hasn’t exactly been a dull week, has it?… Politics is a rough, tough, unpredictable business – and troubles come in bunches.” Sir Keir is not a man who finds it easy to apologise, to charm or to ask for sympathy. He also has yet to attempt the upbeat optimism of Tony Blair, Labour’s last election winner. His speech in Brighton in 1997 was one happy boast. “I am proud, privileged to stand before you… I want to set an ambitious cause for this country. To be nothing less than the model 21st Century nation, a beacon to the world.” Sir Keir is likely to be happier following David Cameron in 2010 and Boris Johnson in 2019. Both spent much of their time putting the boot into the Labour Party they had just defeated. He will have to tread carefully however, especially since he is refusing to apologise for the gifts he is taking. He would be bold indeed to repeat the charge he made in his first full conference speech as Labour leader: “The one thing about Boris Johnson that offends everything I stand for is his assumption that the rules don’t apply to him.” Nobody should expect a change of direction from the prime minister at conference from the spending and tax rises due to be announced by Ms Reeves in her budget on 30 October. For now the government’s plans to generate hope and growth hang on organisational changes which won’t cost the Treasury much, such as partial rail renationalisation, the private sector building onshore wind, renters reform, workers’ rights, Ofsted reform, a planning overhaul and booting out hereditary lords. In a round of pre-conference interviews, Sir Keir gave previews of the core argument he is likely to make in his speech. Things are tough now and spending cuts are being made, but that is like “stripping down and doing the difficult work first”, he says, when you are “redoing a house”. Anyone who has tried a home renovation will know that they take years and always much longer than predicted. There will be no jam on Tuesday in Sir Keir’s leader’s speech, and certainly no piece of cake.","summary":"Even the Iron Lady flinched at the prospect of delivering her leader&#8217;s speech to the annual party conference.

Biden welcomed Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida for a four-way meeting near his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware, to stress the importance of maintaining the Quad, which he sees as a signature foreign policy achievement, before he leaves office in January. Senior Biden administration officials told reporters ahead of the meeting that the leaders would announce plans to expand an Indo-Pacific Partnership for Maritime Domain Awareness, launched two years ago to include the Indian Ocean region. The leaders will announce a plan for joint coast guard operations that will see Australian, Japanese and Indian personnel spend time on a U.S. Coast Guard vessel. The countries will also announce plans for increased military logistics cooperation, the officials said before the meeting. They said the leaders would step up work to provide critical and security technologies, including a new open radio access network, to the Pacific islands and Southeast Asia, regions of intense competition with China, Washington’s main strategic competitor. A health initiative will highlight cooperation in combating cervical cancer, the officials said. Analysts said the expected outcomes would mostly build on work that has already been done within the Quad, which Biden elevated to summit level in 2021. Saturday’s meeting will be Quad’s sixth leader meeting. Journalists were granted access to initial remarks from the leaders before a meeting on Saturday. However, after journalists were asked to leave, officials were briefly caught on hot mics discussing China during what was intended to be a private meeting. “Our first topic of discussion is China,” said Secretary of State Antony Blinken after reporters were escorted out. Moments later, Biden said, “We believe Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China diplomatic relationships. And he’s also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China’s interest.” “China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region. It is true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South China, South Asia and the Taiwan Strait,” Biden continued. “It’s true across the scope of our relationship, including on economic and technology issues. At the same time, we believe intense competition requires intense diplomacy.” The president also pointed to his phone call with China’s President Xi Jinping earlier this year, as well as national security adviser Jake Sullivan’s trip to China this summer, adding that “we see this engagement as important for conflict prevention and crisis management amidst our strategic competition.” The hot mic comments about China came after Sullivan was asked earlier on Saturday about whether the four leaders will focus on China. “The Quad isn’t really about any other country. It’s not directed at another country,” Sullivan told reporters. “It’s directed at problem-solving, standing up for a set of common principles and a common vision for the region.” “So I don’t think you should expect to see focus on any particular country, including the PRC in the Quad leader statement,” he continued, using the abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. Analysts said new maritime security initiatives at a time when China is stepping up pressure on its territorial rivals in the South and East China Seas would send a message to Beijing. They said it would also represent a further shift of emphasis of the Quad’s activities to security issues, reflecting growing concerns about China’s intentions. Lisa Curtis, an Asia policy expert at the Center for a New American Security who previously worked at the White House, CIA and State Department, said India, which is not part of any military alliance, has been worried about perceptions that the Quad could be militarizing the Indo-Pacific. “But I think China’s recent maritime aggression could be changing the equation for India and could be prompting India to become a bit more open to the idea of Quad security cooperation,” she said. Analysts and officials say Biden hosting the Quad is part of efforts to institutionalize the body ahead of his departure from office, as well as that of Kishida, who is stepping down after a leadership contest next week, and elections in Australia by next year. “We’re expecting this Quad summit … to demonstrate the Quad partners are more strategically aligned than they have ever been, that they remain committed to putting real resources behind this effort to provide public goods for the Indo-Pacific, and most importantly, that the Quad is here to stay,” a senior U.S. official said. The official noted that the Quad met at foreign minister level under the previous administration of Donald Trump, who is running against Vice President Kamala Harris in November, and enjoyed bipartisan support, as reflected by the formation of a congressional Quad Caucus ahead of the summit. Albanese told reporters on Thursday that Canberra and Washington share concerns about China’s security ambitions in Pacific islands countries where Beijing is seeking a growing policing role. “We’ll be discussing ways in which we can provide further support in the region to developing nations, including the action that we’re taking together on climate change and supporting their energy security,” he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLeaders of Australia, India, Japan and the United States will announce plans&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Indo-Pacific Leaders Strengthen Maritime Security Cooperation at Biden&#8217;s Final Summit first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/indo-pacific-leaders-strengthen-maritime-security-cooperation-at-bidens-final-summit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Indo-Pacific-leaders-expand-maritime-security-cooperation-at.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 23:15:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.099},{"id":256945342,"title":"Vance: Trump tickets picks up ‘100,000 votes’ with every time Harris bombs an interview","text":"Kamala Harris is serving up so much “word salad” during her rare media interviews according to Republican veep candidate J.D. Vance, that the Trump campaign is openly rooting for her to do more. “Every time she does [an interview], I think we pick up 100,000 votes,” quipped during a rally on Saturday in Leesport, Pa., when asked about Harris avoiding media interviews. Harris’ latest public-speaking debacle came Thursday during a star-studded virtual rally hosted by Oprah Winfrey. She ended with a two-minute monologue that confused many people listening — including Winfrey, according to online commentators who said the powerful media mogul looked “lost” and “unimpressed.” “We love our country. I love our country. I know we all do, that’s why everybody’s here right now. We love our country. We– we take pride in the privilege of being American and this is a moment where we can and must come together as Americans, understanding we have so much more in common than what separates us,” Harris said with pauses and smiles. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump also fired shots at Harris’ bizarre remarks at the celebrity rally while addressing 10,000 of his supporters on Saturday in Wilmington, N.C. “Kamala was a total disaster yesterday, and at every other interview it’s been a freefall …. She just can’t do an interview,” he said. During a softball interview with an ABC affiliate last week – her first solo media sit-down since becoming the Democratic presidential nominee — Harris also appeared to dodge questions and said little of substance. Harris went off on a series of cringe-worthy rants with anchor Brian Taff of Philadelphia-based Action News 6, including after Taff’s initial question on how she’d bring prices down in the U.S. “Well, I’ll start with this: I grew up as a middle-class kid. My mother raised my sister and me. She worked very hard,” said Harris, before moving on to greener pastures — but not the economy. “I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn. You know? And, um, and I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity,” the vice president added. She never said how she’d tackle inflation, but instead highlighted her proposed policy to give a $25,000 handout to new homeowners and provide tax breaks to new small businesses.","summary":"Kamala Harris is serving up so much “word salad” during her rare media interviews according to Republican veep candidate J.D.

Martin Sheen and others from the cast of “The West Wing,” the hit drama about a liberal president and his staff, were invited by first lady Jill Biden for an event to mark the 25th anniversary of the show. Sheen exhorted the crowd to find something worth fighting for, “something deeply personal and uncompromising, something that can unite the will of the spirit with the work of the flesh.” His voice and hands rose, his cadence matching perfectly that of President Jed Bartlet, the character Sheen played for seven seasons. “When we find that, we will discover fire for the second time, and then we will be able to help lift up this nation and all its people to that place where the heart is without fear, and their head is held high,” Sheen said. “The West Wing” remains a favorite of many who now work in Washington, both liberal and conservative. Among those spotted in the Rose Garden were House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, and Joe Walsh, once a tea party-aligned Illinois congressman who is now a sharp critic of former President Donald Trump and supporting Vice President Kamala Harris. Asked to name his favorite character, Walsh replied, “I’m partial to Martin Sheen because I want to be president one day.” (Walsh ran and lost a longshot Republican primary challenge to Trump in 2020.) It was clear in the speeches and the party’s touches that at least a few “West Wing” fans work in the White House. There was the U.S. Marine Band playing the opening notes to the show’s theme as Biden and the cast walked out. There were references to “big blocks of cheese” — a show tradition of requiring staffers to meet with eccentric or offbeat characters — and the walk-and-talk dialogues in which characters moved through the halls at high speed. Waiters passed out bourbon-and-ginger ale cocktails called “The Jackal,” a reference to press secretary C.J. Cregg’s dance and lip sync routine in one iconic episode. The show’s creator, Aaron Sorkin, spoke after Sheen and referenced a bit of real-world politics: Biden’s decision not to seek a second term after his disastrous debate performance. Sorkin was among the high-profile Democrats who called for him to withdraw, writing a column for The New York Times with a potential “script” for Democrats to replace Biden as their nominee with a Republican, Utah Sen. Mitt Romney. His column ran on July 21, hours before Biden announced he would drop out. “The fact is, ‘West Wing’ moments do happen,” he said Friday, addressing the first lady. “And Dr. Biden, we saw proof of that on the morning of July 21.” Sorkin also recognized the cast members in attendance. Among them: Richard Schiff, who played communications director Toby Ziegler; Janel Moloney, who played assistant Donna Moss; and Dulé Hill, who played the president’s bodyman, Charlie Young. He noted the absence of a few high-profile actors — Allison Janney, who played Cregg, as well as Bradley Whitford and Rob Lowe — who he said were on set elsewhere. “The rest of us are apparently unemployed,” he joked. After the crowd laughed, a voice chimed in from Sorkin’s right. “Not yet!” Jill Biden said.","summary":"WASHINGTON (AP) — With President Joe Biden away from the White House, it was left Friday to another man with Oval Office experience to stand at the front of the Rose Garden and give a rousing call to service....","url":"https://nation.lk/online/the-west-wing-cast-visits-the-white-house-for-a-25th-anniversary-party-277863.html","image":"https://s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/assets.eastidahonews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/jill-biden-and-west-wing.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 23:00:08","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"lk","sentiment":0.357},{"id":256945744,"title":"Trump rejects CNN debate against Harris, citing start of early voting","text":"Earlier in the day, Harris’s campaign said she had accepted an invitation from broadcaster CNN to participate in a debate on October 23. It would have been the candidates’ second debate, after a September 10 encounter that most pundits said she had won. “The American people deserve another opportunity to see Vice President Kamala Harris and Donald Trump debate before they cast their ballots,” her campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a statement. “I hope (Trump) will join me,” Harris posted on X. Trump claimed during a campaign rally in the battleground state of North Carolina that he would like to debate — calling it “good entertainment value” — but the start of early voting in some states had taken the air out of the idea. “It’s just too late, voting has already started,” he said. He added, to a large and enthusiastic crowd of supporters, that while CNN had been “very fair” when he debated President Joe Biden in June, “they won’t be fair again.” Vice President Harris replaced her boss at the top of the Democratic ticket after the 81-year-old Biden’s disastrous performance against Trump. His exit from the race left Trump, 78, now the oldest ever presidential nominee, against a much younger Harris, 59. Voting underway Saturday’s announcement came as some states have already begun early voting in what is an agonizingly close race. The result is expected to hinge on seven battleground states, including North Carolina. Trump addressed the crowd in the port city of Wilmington from behind bulletproof glass, following an apparent second assassination attempt against him. A gunman was discovered on his golf course in Florida last Sunday, with security agents foiling any plan to harm the former president. In July, Trump was struck on the ear by a bullet at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, after a gunman opened fire from a nearby rooftop. The US Secret Service — tasked with protecting the candidate — on Friday admitted to “deficiencies” and “complacency” in the shocking security breach. Anti-immigrant rhetoric Trump won North Carolina in the 2020 election against Biden. But Harris is aiming to flip the southeastern state for Democrats, on the strength of her support from African Americans and young voters. Trump’s speech on Saturday reinforced the hardline anti-immigrant rhetoric that has become a centerpiece of his campaign, falsely claiming migrants were “attacking villages and cities all throughout the Midwest.” He also promised the crowd that the United States would “reach Mars before the end of my term.” The former president was facing a new challenge in North Carolina after a bombshell report on Thursday revealed that Mark Robinson, the Republican candidate for governor whom Trump has endorsed, had called himself a “Black Nazi” and made other incendiary comments on a porn website message board more than a decade ago. Robinson has denounced the CNN report as “salacious tabloid lies.” The presidential race remains neck-and-neck and every vote will count in the election, whose result Trump has once again refused to say he will accept if he loses. Trump faces criminal charges for allegedly trying to overturn the 2020 result, after which his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on January 6, 2021.","summary":"Harris's campaign said she had accepted an invitation from broadcaster CNN to participate in a debate on October 23.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/09/21/donald-trump-cnn-presidential-debate-kamala-harris-early-voting/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2172740128-e1726958746492.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 22:52:18","author":"AFP","authors":["AFP"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.325},{"id":256944248,"title":"Harris Agrees To Second Debate, Trump Says It's 'Too Late'","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris agreed Saturday to debate former President Donald Trump again next month — but he told a crowd of supporters it was \"too late\" for a rematch.Both candidates \"received an invitation\" from CNN to face off Oct. 23 in the Atlanta studio where Trump debated President Joe Biden in June before Biden dropped his reelection bid, the network noted.Harris' campaign chair, Jen O'Malley Dillon, said in a statement that the Democratic nominee was \"ready for another opportunity to share a stage with Donald Trump,\" and that he \"should have no problem agreeing to this debate.\"Harris also said on social media that she \"will gladly accept a second presidential debate\" and added that she hoped Trump \"will join me.\"But Trump said during a campaign rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, that he would turn down the invite.\"The problem with another debate is that it's just too late, voting has already started,\" he said, CNN reported.Since their Sept. 10 debate, Trump has waffled on the idea of facing Harris again, saying in a Sept. 12 post on his social media website, \"THERE WILL BE NO THIRD DEBATE!\" because, he insisted, he had won.The next day, he softened that position, telling reporters in California: \"I did great in the debates, and I think they've answered everything.

She boosted her war chest in August after raising $361 million, while Trump spent $32 million more than the $130 million he raised as he launched a costly ad campaign to blunt her momentum. His allied super political action committee also depleted some of their cash reserves. Trump got support from new sources including donors from the crypto industry, whom he’s assiduously courted, and some longtime Republican donors who’ve only recently started supporting him, such as hedge fund manager Paul Singer, who didn’t contribute to his prior campaigns. The filings recorded the largest single reported gift from Elon Musk, the Tesla Inc. and SpaceX chief executive officer. He gave $289,100, the maximum amount, to the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports GOP House candidates. Musk also created a super PAC this year to support Trump and House Republicans, which has been spending millions in recent weeks. It won’t disclose its donors until next month. The new support for Trump wasn’t enough to offset the costs of launching expensive ad campaigns. Harris and her main super PAC, Future Forward PAC, have booked $421 million in paid media from September through Election Day, nearly double the $216 million for Trump and his allied super PAC MAGA Inc.

Finance industry donors included Oaktree Capital Management LLC’s Bruce Karsh, Robert Stavis of Bessemer Venture Partners and I Squared Capital co-founder Sadek Wahba. Janice Savin Williams of Siebert Williams Shanke, legendary oil trader Andy Hall, Glenn Fuhrman, who managed money for Michael Dell, and E. John Rosenwald, a vice chair at JPMorgan Chase, also donated. Celebrities Scarlett Johansson, Carol Burnett, Frances McDormand, Mayim Bialik and Alan Alda were among the donors. Fashion brand founders Stacey Bendet, of Alice + Olivia, and LoveShackFancy’s Rebecca Hessel Cohen also gave. Bronson van Wyck, known for designing and planning Trump donor Stephen Schwarzman’s 70th birthday party, joined Florida chronicler Carl Hiaasen and Susan Fales-Hill, a writer and television producer, as Harris donors. Harris’ allied super PAC Future Forward got $3 million each from Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and the Pacific Environmental Coalition, a nonprofit led by technology venture capitalist Matt Cohler. Cohler’s nonprofit donated to Nikki Haley’s super PAC in the Republican primary. Reed Hastings of Netflix and Ripple Labs co-founder Christian Larsen each gave $1 million, the latter in the form of XRP cryptocurrency. (Hastings, co-founder and executive chair of Netflix, is on the board of Bloomberg Inc.)

He also will address the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York and travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells. They are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 15 miles to 20 miles (24 kilometers to 32 kilometers) away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells from the U.S. With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia. So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be “at war” with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan. In response the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month. During his visit, Zelenskyy is expected meet and thank workers who have increased production of the 155 mm rounds over the past year. Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon’s top weapons buyer — are also expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as is Gov. Josh Shapiro, D-Pa. The 155 mm rounds are just one of the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many of the European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict.","summary":"The Scranton Army Ammunition Plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/09/21/ukraine-president-volodymyr-zelenskyy-visit-us-military-aid-american-workers-factories/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24255525004732-e1726956175208.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 22:18:04","author":"Tara Copp,The Associated Press","authors":["Tara Copp","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.081},{"id":256943492,"title":"Biden hosts his final Quad summit at his Delaware home, high school","text":"President Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown of Wilmington to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India as he hosted what is likely the last gathering of the Indo-Pacific partnership that has grown in prominence under his White House tenure.When Mr. Biden began his presidency he looked to elevate the so-called Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific.

The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China.Mr. Biden and Modi had been expected to discuss Modi's recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.Sullivan said \"that countries like India should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity\" and that \"every country, everywhere, should refrain from supplying inputs to Russia's war machine.\"The gathering was also an opportunity for Mr. Biden and Japan's Kishida to bid each other farewell.Mr. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The two leaders sat down for their wide-ranging, one-on-one conversation on Saturday morning.The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and increasing Chinese assertiveness.Mr. Biden commended Kishida for demonstrating \"courage and conviction in strengthening ties\" with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China's \"coercive and destabilizing activities\" in the Pacific, Russia's war against Ukraine and emerging technology issues.Tension surrounds Nippon Steel's proposed acquisition of U.S. SteelThe U.S. and Japan are negotiating through a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Mr. Biden, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the two candidates in the 2024 presidential election, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan's Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel.Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee's formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the Nov. 5 election.Sullivan pushed back against speculation that the expected timing of the report could suggest Mr. Biden is having second thoughts about his opposition to the deal.The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries.The White House said the leaders later Saturday will roll out a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific.

The question was posed at the outgoing President - who is not seeking re-election - as he posed for a photo with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Australian and Japanese counterparts, Anthony Albanese and Fumio Kishida. The four leaders represent the four member countries of the Quad, a security and strategic grouping committed to a free and open Indo-Pacific. Responding to the question on Quad's future, Biden turned around and placed a hand across PM Modi's shoulder and said, \"(It will survive) way beyond November.\" The Quad summit is being held in Biden's hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. The US elections this November will see a Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump fight with Biden not returning to the ring. Japan's Kishida too has announced he won't seek re-election. This implies both the US and Japan are set to be represented by new leaders at its next Quad summit. In his opening remarks, PM Modi offered to host the Quad Leaders' summit in India in 2025. He also highlighted that a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific is a shared priority and shared commitment of the Quad. \"We are meeting at a time when the world is surrounded by tensions and conflicts. At such a time, it is important for all of humanity that the members of the Quad move forward based on shared democratic values,\" he told the Quad leaders.","summary":"US President Joe Biden, one of the architects of the Quad grouping, was asked ahead of the Quad summit in Delaware if it would survive beyond November elections.","url":"https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/watch-will-quad-survive-beyond-november-bidens-gesture-pm-modi-by-his-side-6620503","image":"https://c.ndtvimg.com/2024-09/8t8f5l48_biden-modi_625x300_22_September_24.jpg?im=FeatureCrop,algorithm=dnn,width=1200,height=738","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 22:14:00","author":"His Side","authors":["His Side"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.124},{"id":256942892,"title":"Janet Jackson Talks about Kamala Harris’ Family and Background in a Strange Way","text":"Janet Jackson knows a lot about Rhythm Nation, but she clearly doesn’t know anything about Vice President Kamala Harris‘ heritage. In a sprawling and at times confusing interview with The Guardian, Jackson postulated about Kamala Harris’ family background while seemingly admitting that she did not know what she was talking about. “Well, you know what they supposedly said? She’s not Black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian,” she told the reporter. When the profile writer clarified that she is of both Black and South Asian heritage, Jackson answered, “Her father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days. I was told they discovered her father was white.” Jackson, in making her comments, was parroting conspiracy theory right-wing talking points perpetuated by GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump. At the presidential debate held earlier this month, he said, “I don’t know. I mean all I can say is I read where she was not Black. And then I read that she was Black and that’s OK. Either one was OK with me. That’s up to her.” (In an interview with NPR, one scholar called it birtherism 2.0, referencing the conspiracy first posited by fringe theorists, who wanted to call into question former president Barack Obama’s legitimacy as a candidate by weaponizing his African father’s immigrant status.) It is well documented that Harris’ father, Donald, is a Jamaican American professor of economics at Stanford University, while her late mother, Shyamala Gopalan, a renowned breast cancer researcher and scientist, hailed from southern India. Both her parents immigrated to the United States, meeting as graduate students at the University of California, Berkeley. In Harris’ 2019 memoir, The Truths We Hold, she wrote, “My mother, grandparents, aunts and uncle instilled us with pride in our South Asian roots. Our classical Indian names harked back to our heritage, and we were raised with a strong awareness of and appreciation for Indian culture.” She added, however, “My mother understood very well that she was raising two Black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see Maya [her sister] and me as Black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident, proud Black women.” Elsewhere in the interview, Jackson went on a tangent about “all this child trafficking crap that’s going on,” a strange out-of-the-blue comment considering the plethora of child sexual abuse allegations levied against her late brother. She also said she believes the U.S. will descend into “mayhem” regardless of the election results this November. Jackson, a multiplatinum artist who has influenced everyone from Britney Spears to Kendrick Lamar, has been cited as a source of inspiration by the biggest R&B and pop musicians today. The five-time Grammy-winning artist has also graced television and film screens in credits like Will & Grace (where she played herself), Fame, Good Times, Nutty Professor II: The Klumps and Poetic Justice, for which she got an Oscar nom for Best Original Song. The legendary performer is currently on the second leg of her Together Again tour. Her older brother, Tito, the founding guitarist of The Jackson 5, died less than a week ago.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nJanet Jackson knows a lot about Rhythm Nation, but she clearly doesn’t&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Janet Jackson Talks about Kamala Harris&#8217; Family and Background in a Strange Way first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/janet-jackson-talks-about-kamala-harris-family-and-background-in-a-strange-way/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Janet-Jackson-Goes-On-Bizarre-Kamala-Harris.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 22:12:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.091},{"id":256942734,"title":"Trump Melts Down And Attacks Bill Maher And Stephanie Ruhle As Election Slips Away","text":"More proof that Trump knows that the election is slipping away from him as he went off off on a rant about Bill Maher, Stephanie Ruhle, Bret Stephens, and The New York Times.

That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian,” the “That’s The Way Love Goes” hitmaker, 58, said during a chat about “the State of the Union.” “Her father’s white. That’s what I was told,” she went on. “I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white.” Vice President Harris, 59, is the daughter of two immigrants. Her father is Jamaican while her mother is Indian. Fans were appalled by Jackson’s false statements and slammed her on X, with one writing, “This is why she’s irrelevant and leeching off of her brothers’ success.” Of course, the singer’s older brother is the late Michael Jackson, who was frequently questioned after his skin turned black to white in the 1990s. It was known at the time that he had vitiligo, a disorder that causes patches of skin to lose color, per Mayo Clinic. Bringing up the debate that the “Beat It” singer’s changing skin tone caused, another X user penned, “Janet, you know better than to believe that nonsense… especially after all the race controversies Michael went through…” “‘That’s what I heard’ is the new way of saying ‘i believe the stupid, unsubstantiated s–t people tell me,'” a third dismayed person tweeted. Another shocked user added, “I have always been a fan of Janet Jackson but this just no. Stop.” Several others compared Janet’s comments to the statement Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made about Harris changing her race while speaking at a conference of black journalists in July. “I’ve known her a long time, indirectly, and she was always of Indian heritage, and she was only promoting Indian heritage,” the former president, 78, said. “I did not know she was black until a number of years ago when she happened to turn black, and now she wants to be known as black.” He added, “I respect either one, but she obviously doesn’t, because she was Indian all the way, and then all of a sudden, she made a turn and … she became black.” Page Six contacted Janet’s rep for comment but did not immediately hear back.","summary":"\"I was told that they discovered her father was white,\" the musician said in a recent interview.","url":"https://pagesix.com/2024/09/21/celebrity-news/janet-jackson-called-irrelevantfor-questioning-kamala-harris-race/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2024/09/90160027.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:50:02","author":"Sara Whitman","authors":["Sara Whitman"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.703},{"id":256944062,"title":"Biden tells Quad leaders that Beijing is testing region at turbulent moment for Chinese economy","text":"CLAYMONT, Del. (AP) — President Joe Biden told Indo-Pacific allies on Saturday that he believes China’s increasing military assertiveness is an effort to test the region at a turbulent moment for Beijing. Biden’s comments were caught by a hot mic after he and fellow leaders of the so-called Quad delivered opening remarks before the press at a summit he’s hosting near his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. He said his administration sees Beijing’s actions as a “change in tactic, not a change in strategy.” China continues to struggle to pull up its economy that was pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic and has seen an extended slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand. “At least from our perspective, we believe Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China’s diplomatic relationships, and he’s also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China’s interest,” Biden told Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. “It is true across the scope of our relationship, including on economic and technology issues.” Starting with a trade war that dates back to 2018, China and the United States have grown at odds over a range of issues, from global security, such as China’s claims over the South China Sea, to industrial policy on electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturing. The administration has repeatedly spoken out about concerns about Chinese military assertiveness against Taiwan and more recently on the frequent clashes between the Chinese and Philippines navies in the South China Sea. Biden recently dispatched his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Beijing for three days of talks with Chinese officials. Sullivan during that visit also met with Xi. Both governments are eager to keep relations on an even keel ahead of a change in the U.S. presidency in January. And both sides have said they remain committed to managing the relationship, following up on a meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco last November. Biden added that he continues to believe “intense competition requires intense diplomacy.” The comments came as Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India as he hosted what is likely the last gathering of the Indo-Pacific partnership that has grown in prominence under his White House tenure. When Biden began his presidency he looked to elevate the Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific.

Trump campaigned in Wilmington, along the state's southern coast, without Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the GOP gubernatorial nominee and one of the former president's top surrogates in the state, following a CNN report about his alleged posts on a pornography website’s message board. He did not mention Robinson during a speech that lasted just over an hour. Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn’t be forced out of the race by “salacious tabloid lies.” Trump's campaign has appeared to distance itself from Robinson in the wake of the CNN reporting, which the AP has not independently verified, saying in a statement that Trump “is focused on winning the White House and saving this country\" and calling North Carolina “a vital part of that plan,\" without mentioning Robinson. Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump’s ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together, as well as a new ad from Harris' campaign highlighting the Republican candidates’ ties as well as Robinson’s support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. According to Harris’ campaign, it’s their first ad effort related to tying Trump to a down-ballot race. Both abortion rights and Robinson are electoral liabilities for Trump in a state he previously won twice. Already before CNN's report, Robinson was trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the state’s attorney general. Polls show Trump and Harris locked in a close race here and nationally. Trump downplays abortion as a campaign issue In his first outdoor rally since the second apparent attempt to assassinate him, Trump argued women would be safer and more prosperous with him as president and would “no longer be thinking about abortion.\" “I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe and secure,” Trump said. “Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and their lives will be great again. So women, we love you. We’re going to take care of you.” The former president said women won't have to think about abortion because decisions about regulating it are now left to the states. Many Republican-led states have taken steps to restrict or eliminate abortion access after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. Trump nominated three of the six justices who voted to overturn Roe. Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories North Carolina banned most abortions after 12 weeks last year, with Republicans in the state legislature overriding Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's veto. Voters overwhelmingly say they trust Harris to do a better job handling abortion policy, with 55 per cent favouring her while 27 per cent favoured Trump in a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Harris and Democrats running down ballot have highlighted stories of women who faced severe medical complications or death because they didn't get proper medical care from doctors worried about the impact of abortion laws. Harris on Friday blasted Trump as a threat to women’s freedoms and their lives, warning in a speech in Georgia that Republicans would continue to target access to abortion if he returns to the White House. Trump also showed a gentler side, inviting two of his young grandchildren on stage. The former president lifted Carolina to the microphone, where she said “Make America great again” to cheers, followed by her older brother, Luke Trump, who said, “Vote for Grandpa.” They’re the children of Eric Trump, the former president’s second son, and his wife, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native who is now serving as co-chair of the Republican National Committee. Bulletproof glass surrounded Trump as he spoke, a new precaution for outdoor venues the Secret Service implemented after a bullet grazed Trump's ear during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective Trump supporters dismiss the new claims against Robinson A Republican has carried North Carolina in every general election since 1976 save one, when Barack Obama won the state in 2008. Trump won there in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state that Trump won. That’s part of why Democrats see the state as winnable this fall. With neither Senate seat up for grabs, the gubernatorial contest has been North Carolina’s marquee down-ballot race this year. Robinson has become a natural top surrogate for Trump in the state and a frequent presence at campaign events there, appearing with the nominee as recently as an event last month in Asheboro. Trump has long praised Robinson, who is Black, referring to him as “Martin Luther King on steroids.\" Endorsing Robinson ahead of the GOP gubernatorial primary, Trump continued: “I think you’re better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two.” Robinson has a long history of making inflammatory comments, including suggesting women who sought abortion “weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down\" and comparing abortion to slavery. Charlie Kimball, a 46-year-old former construction worker from Burgaw, who said he is currently on disability, dismissed the new allegations against Robinson as “fake news.\" “That’s his personal life. Who cares?” Kimball said. “It’s all hearsay … It’s not true. It’s all speculation. Where’s the proof?\" While more visits have been made by presidential contenders to the Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, both Harris and Trump have made multiple trips to North Carolina, highlighting the state’s importance. Following Biden’s departure from the race in July, Trump held his first large-scale rally there, turning his full focus toward Harris. Wilmington is home to New Hanover County, which Biden won in 2020. But his margin over Trump in the county was among his slimmest in the state. Julia Novotny, 55, of Wilmington, said she's come around to supporting Trump after initial reservations because of allegations that he's been sexually abusive to women, which he denies. “He’s classy, he’s a gentleman, he looks good in a suit and he has strong values,” Novotny said. “Everybody makes mistakes, and whether he did or didn’t, I don’t know, but you know what? Leave him alone. He’s a good man. He wants to change this country. Our country is in the dirt, and the only man who pulls us out is Donald Trump.” Follow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp Associated Press writers Michelle L. Price in New York and Jonathan J. Cooper in Phoenix contributed to this report.","summary":"Donald Trump returned to North Carolina on Saturday, stumping in the southern battleground state with direct appeals to women, claiming he would be a better champion for them than U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, who is vying to become the first female president.","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/trump-appeals-to-women-in-return-to-north-carolina-without-mark-robinson-a-top-in-state-supporter-1.7047441","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/content/dam/ctvnews/en/images/2024/9/21/donald-trump-1-7047445-1726954797909.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:43:37","author":"Meg Kinnard And Erik Verduzco,The Associated Press","authors":["Meg Kinnard And Erik Verduzco","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":256941878,"title":"Trump Claims Women Will Be ‘Happy, Free’ Due to Abortion Bans","text":"Donald Trump appeared at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina on Saturday, his first time in the state since CNN reported that Trump-backed gubernatorial nominee, Mark Robinson, made lewd and divisive comments — including calling himself a “black NAZI,” expressing support for reviving slavery, and admitting to enjoying porn featuring trans performers — on the pornographic website “Nude Africa” more than a decade ago. Trump recognized a number of Republicans while completely sidestepping any mention of Robinson during his rhetoric-and-racism-filled rally, which included his typical unsubstantiated rants that migrants are ruining our country, this time claiming they are “attacking villages and cities throughout the Midwest” and that “every job” created in the U.S. in the last two years has gone to migrants. He also touched on his obsessions with crowd size, saying this one went back “as far as the eye can see” to open the rally and later denying that he and J.D. Vance are “weird.” He said women will be better off should he be reelected, claiming “Women will be happy, healthy, confident, and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion because it is now where it always had to be, with the states,” despite 63 percent of U.S. adults in a Pew Research Center survey saying abortion should be legal in all or most cases. He also made the unsubstantiated claim that Democrats are demanding “execution of a baby after birth, which is what they want.” His claim was eloquently refuted earlier in the month during his debate with Democratic presidential nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris. Yet, he added on Saturday, “I will protect women at a level never seen before. They will finally be healthy, hopeful, safe, and secure. Their lives will be happy, beautiful, and their lives will be great again.” Meanwhile, as abortion has been in the hand of states, a disinformation campaign against a ballot measure to restore abortion rights in Florida has taken hold as providers say the state’s abortion ban has doctors afraid to do their jobs and is putting patients at risk. Trump’s rally comes ahead of running mate J.D. Vance’s appearance as a special guest of the Tucker Carlson Live show in Hershey, Pennsylvania also on Saturday. Trump’s next rally will be held in Indiana, Pennsylvania on Monday.","summary":"During his rally in Wilmington, North Carolina the former president who helped kill Roe v.

The coins were announced Saturday. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts The Trump Coins website describes the $100 coin as a one ounce “99.9% fine silver,” much higher than the $31.50 per ounce market value of silver (though if it proves a true collectible, its price could hypothetically grow). Trump announced the coin in a Truth Social post Saturday, and it features Trump’s profile on one side and the White House and his signature on the other. The collectible coin’s page notes the product is “not political” and has “nothing to do with any political campaign,” adding the coin is not sold by Trump, The Trump Organization or any of its affiliates. Trump’s coin will be released about a month after he released his fourth series of non-fungible token trading cards for $99, marking one of the former president’s latest attempts at courting crypto traders. Trump also launched a line of high-top sneakers in February starting at $99 and selling for as much as $399 per pair. The former president endorsed a $60 Bible in March as part of a partnership with Lee Greenwood, the singer and songwriter behind the chart-topping hit, “God Bless the USA.” The Trump campaign did not immediately respond to Forbes’ request for comment.

How Much Has Trump Made Off His Bibles, Sneakers And Nfts? The bible endorsed by Trump generated $300,000 in sales, according to recent financial disclosures cited by the Los Angeles Times. It is unclear how much money the entire line of Trump sneakers raked in, though the $399 shoes were limited to 1,000 pairs and eventually sold out, according to The Washington Post, meaning at least $399,000 was made off the sneaker line. The former president’s involvement in NFTs has provided the highest gains for him, as he netted $7.2 million from NFT licensing fees, according to CBS News. Forbes Valuation We estimate Trump’s net worth at $3.7 billion, which slightly dropped this week after Trump Media stock repeatedly hit record lows. Much of that fortune, however, is wrapped up in his DJT stock, the media company behind his social network, Truth Social, which many believe is wildly overvalued. Key Background The merchandise has been released as Trump has battled multiple criminal cases against him that have culminated in hundreds of millions of dollars in unpaid legal fees. In February, the former president was ordered to pay more than $440 million in a fraud trial against him and the Trump Organization. Trump’s legal expenses for the firms representing him across multiple trials reached nearly $6 million in February and slightly lowered to more than $3.5 million in March, April and May, according to Axios. Trump’s cash crunch has also extended to his campaign financing, as Vice President Kamala Harris’s campaign outspent Trump’s campaign by a large margin in August, but managed to raise enough to maintain an edge over Trump, according to Politico, which noted the Harris campaign reported raising $190 million last month compared to the Trump campaign’s $45 million in fundraising within the same period.

Sipas Donald Trump, zëvendëspresidentja Kamala Harris kërkon një debat të dytë pasi e vëren se po humb përballë tij. “Tani ajo dëshiron të bëjë një debat para zgjedhjeve me CNN, sepse po humb keq”.

C. - U.S. Sen. JD Vance on Saturday responded to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine’s criticism of attacks he and Donald Trump have leveled at Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio by saying the Republican party is a “big tent” where disagreements are welcome. “We’re OK with disagreements, as long as you’ve got common sense,” Vance told a rally at a fairgrounds in Berks County, Pennsylvania, claiming that Democrats try to censor people who disagree with them. “That’s not what Donald Trump and I are doing. So, let’s have the conversation.” DeWine on Friday called out former President Donald Trump and Vance, his vice presidential running mate, for spreading unsubstantiated rumors that Haitian immigrants in Springfield are eating people’s pets. In a lengthy op-ed published in the New York Times, Vance said he was “saddened by how they and others continue to repeat claims that lack evidence and disparage the legal migrants living in Springfield.” “This rhetoric hurts the city and its people, and it hurts those who have spent their lives there,” DeWine’s opinion piece said. “The Biden administration’s failure to control the southern border is a very important issue that Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance are talking about and one that the American people are rightfully deeply concerned about,” DeWine contined. “But their verbal attacks against these Haitians — who are legally present in the United States — dilute and cloud what should be a winning argument about the border. In Pennsylvania on Saturday, Vance pointed out that DeWine has endorsed the Trump ticket, as have public figures as diverse as former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, former Hawaii U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, Georgia Gov Brian Kemp, and Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.. Vance said that he’s thrilled to have DeWine’s political support, but believes he is wrong about the Haitian migrants to Springfield, who are in the U.S. legally under temporary protected status, a policy that was extended in June for another 18 months. “The 20,000 Haitian migrants who have come to Springfield are part of hundreds of thousands of Haitian migrants, part of 25 million illegal aliens in this country,” said Vance. He said that when the media says people are here legally, they mean that “Kamala Harris has granted mass amnesty to millions of illegal aliens. “Now I happen to think that what Kamala Harris has done is not just wrong, it is illegal,” Vance continued. “So, when Kamala Harris uses an illegal action to give amnesty to aliens that does not make them legal immigrants, that makes them illegal immigrants, unless you’ve lost all common sense.” “So. I’m going to keep on talking about illegal immigration,” Vance continued. “I’m going to keep on talking about how Kamala Harris doesn’t have the authority to grant mass amnesty, and I’m going to keep on talking about the fact that we need to close down that border and send Kamala Harris back to San Francisco where she belongs.”","summary":"Donald Trump's vice-presidential nominee said the GOP is a \"big tent\" with room for disparate viewpoints.","url":"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2024/09/jd-vance-isnt-bothered-by-dewines-criticism-of-his-attacks-on-haitian-immigrants-in-springfield.html","image":"https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/DG2YTKO5YNHVNBCG32YXNMTTHU.jpg?auth=1d2379bb916e1715555974a1f8a5acad2cacd77d6e3b9a5de6d08133cbef88bf&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:21:50","author":"Sabrina Eaton","authors":["Sabrina Eaton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":256941512,"title":"'Trump made Robinson...': Harris' campaign aims to shift voters in NC amid scandal","text":"Kamala Harris' campaign is taking advantage of the scandal surrounding North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson as an opportunity to make inroads with Black and suburban voters.With Robinson facing backlash for controversial comments, including those made on a pornographic website, Harris' advisers see an opportunity to shift voter sentiment.According to Politico the campaign's strategy, as outlined in a memo by senior advisers Scott Falmlen and LT McCrimmon, revolves around targeting moderate Republicans, suburban voters in Charlotte and Raleigh, and Black voters in this critical swing state.The campaign aims to remind voters of Trump and Robinson's long-standing relationship, and utilise footage of their appearances together. “Trump made Mark Robinson, and he will have to answer for him,” the advisers said.Harris' team is focusing on Robinson's controversial positions, particularly his remarks on abortion, which they believe will alienate voters. The memo pointed out that while Trump has attempted to present himself as a moderate on abortion, Harris’ team is capitalizing on his recent declaration that he will oppose a Florida ballot measure aimed at expanding access to the procedure. Meanwhile, Robinson's controversial statement that women seek abortions \"because you weren’t responsible enough to keep your skirt down\" further highlights his extreme views, which the campaign believes will resonate negatively with voters.To kick off this strategy, Harris’ team launched a new ad featuring Robinson’s inflammatory comments, juxtaposed with clips of Trump praising him. North Carolina, which hasn’t voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Barack Obama in 2008, is seen as a key battleground for Harris. Trump narrowly won the state in 2020, but Harris’ campaign views it as their 'top pickup opportunity' in the upcoming election.Although Trump has not withdrawn his endorsement of Robinson, he has distanced himself from the controversial candidate, who will not be attending Trump’s rally in Wilmington, North Carolina.","summary":"Kamala Harris' campaign is seizing the scandal surrounding North Carolina gubernatorial candidate Mark Robinson to win over Black and suburban voters.

Governor Mark Robinson have been removed from the porn site Nude Africa following a CNN report outlining the offensive comments made by the Republican gubernatorial nominee between 2008 and 2012. Robinson has rejected all responsibility for the comments, which were posted before he went into politics. His comments, which were removed on Thursday, go against his public positions on matters including reproductive and trans rights. Robinson shared his full name on the porn site and was a frequent user of its message board, according to the bombshell CNN Report. He also used an email address on the site that he used on a number of other sites for years. He also used the username, “minisoldr”, on other websites. CNN matched the “minisoldr” account to a large number of biographical details shared by Robinson. He wrote on the site about “peeping” on women in public gym showers when he was 14. “I came to a spot that was a dead end but had two big vent covers over it! It just so happened it overlooked the showers! I sat there for about an hour and watched as several girls came in and showered,” he wrote on Nude Africa, according to CNN. “I like watching tranny on girl porn! That’s f****** hot! It takes the man out while leaving the man in!” Robinson wrote in separate comments on the site. He has a history of anti-trans rhetoric. In his online comments, Robinson repeatedly attacked Martin Luther King Jr, including when a new monument was put in place in Washington, DC. “Get that f****** commie bastard off the National Mall!” he wrote at the time. One user accused the gubernatorial candidate of being a white supremacist. “I’m not in the KKK. They don’t let blacks join. If I was in the KKK I would have called him Martin Lucifer Koon!” he wrote. Robinson wrote “I’m a Black NAZI!” on a forum discussing Black Republicans. “Slavery is not bad. Some people need to be slaves. I wish they would bring it (slavery) back. I would certainly buy a few,” he wrote in a separate post. “I’d take Hitler over any of the s*** that’s in Washington right now!” he wrote in March 2012. In October 2011, he called Martin Luther King Jr “worse than a maggot” and a “huckster.” Former President Donald Trump, who campaigned in North Carolina without Robinson on Saturday, has previously heaped praise on the gubernatorial candidate, calling him Martin Luther King “on steroids.” Robinson, who previously received Trump’s endorsement, is set to appear at a rally in Fayetteville later on Saturday, without Trump. Robinson is running against the Democratic nominee for governor Josh Stein to replace Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat. The Republican faced calls to leave the race after the CNN revelations but a deadline to remove him from the ballot came and went on Thursday night. North Carolina is a battleground state targeted by both Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. The last Democrat to win the state on the presidential level was former president Barack Obama in 2008. The Harris campaign moved fast to try to link Trump to Robinson after the CNN revelations, sharing footage on social media of Trump praising his fellow Republican. In a statement to news outlets on Thursday, the Trump campaign didn’t address the allegations against Robinson. “President Trump’s campaign is focused on winning the White House and saving this country. North Carolina is an [sic] vital part of that plan,” a spokesperson said. “We are confident that as voters compare the Trump record of a strong economy, low inflation, a secure border, and safe streets, with the failures of Biden-Harris, then President Trump will win the Tarheel State once again. We will not take our eye off the ball.” The lieutenant governor denied making the comments when speaking to CNN on Thursday. “This is not us. These are not our words. And this is not anything that is characteristic of me,” he said. “I’m not going to get into the minutia of how somebody manufactured this, these salacious tabloid lies.” He told CNN that the issues the residents of his state face are more important than “tabloid trash” as he began attacking his Democratic opponent. “We are not getting out of this race. There are people who are counting on us to win this race,” he told the network. He has also attempted to blame artificial intelligence for making the posts.","summary":"Trump and Robinson appear at separate rallies in North Carolina as Trump campaign appear to distance former president from gubernatorial nominee in key battleground state","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/mark-robinson-porn-site-posts-removed-b2616812.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/21/21/SEI222383551.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/P7xGNrqn-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:18:34","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.438},{"id":256911790,"title":"Biden talks China with 'Quad' leaders in hometown summit","text":"U.S. President Joe Biden met with the leaders of Japan, India and Australia to discuss the challenges a rising China poses to their countries, ahead of a farewell summit in his Delaware hometown on Saturday. The talks in Wilmington, in the twilight of Biden's one-term presidency, reflect the importance that the 81-year-old has placed on the so-called \"Quad\" group as a counterweight to Beijing. In a personal touch, Biden hosted Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at his home in the city for private one-on-one meetings on Saturday. He hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese there on Friday night. The media were given no access to the meetings. Biden posted pictures on social media of him with Albanese and then with Kishida in a wood-paneled drawing room in his house, and showing them the view of a lake from a verandah. The White House said in readouts of Biden's meetings with the Australian and Japanese leaders that they had discussed \"their shared concerns about the PRC's (People's Republic of China's) coercive and destabilizing activities, including in the South China Sea.\" Both statements also said the leaders backed \"maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait\" -- referring to tensions over Taiwan, the self-governing democracy that China claims as its territory, to be reunited by force if necessary. There was no immediate statement on Modi's talks with Biden. Later on Saturday, the leaders traveled to Biden's former high school in Wilmington for a formal four-way summit, followed by an event for his \"Cancer Moonshot\" initiative and then a dinner. Kishida, who like Biden is also on his way out of office, and Modi will hold a separate meeting later Saturday, officials said. White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said China would be \"high on the agenda\" at the summit, against a backdrop of tensions with Beijing, particularly over a series of recent confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the disputed South China Sea. As Biden tries to establish his legacy after dropping out of November's US presidential election and handing the campaign reins to Kamala Harris -- who was not invited to the summit -- US officials said there will be \"deliverables\" from the meeting. They include an expansion of maritime security cooperation and the first joint coast guard exercises between the four nations, featuring a meeting on a U.S. vessel. The summit takes place ahead of a U.S. presidential election that is on a knife-edge, with Harris and Republican former President Donald Trump -- who spent his last presidency decreasing US engagement abroad -- neck-and-neck. The Quad grouping dates back to 2007, but Biden was the first to set up leaders' summits and has strongly pushed it as part of an emphasis on international alliances after the isolationist Trump years. US officials played down any risk to the grouping, whoever ends up in the Oval Office in January 2025. \"We are quite confident in the fact that the Quad will endure,\" the senior administration official said. For the United States, Australia and Japan, the Quad is also a long-term courtship of India. New Delhi has historically been insistent on its non-aligned status when it comes to contests between superpowers. © 2024 AFP","summary":"U.S. President Joe Biden met with the leaders of Japan, India and Australia to discuss the challenges a rising China poses to their countries, ahead of a farewell…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/politics/no-place-like-home-biden-hosts-%27quad%27-leaders","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/d8/00/0158d1cfaadb34f739629a4cf491aa06dcb9/d8000158d1cfaadb34f739629a4cf491aa06dcb9/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:17:24","author":"Brendan Smialowski,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Brendan Smialowski","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.395},{"id":256911804,"title":"Kishida, Biden hail stronger Japan-U.S. ties in farewell meeting","text":"Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday celebrated a stronger-than-ever alliance between Tokyo and Washington in what was seen as a farewell meeting between the two outgoing leaders. Biden, who U.S. officials say feels very close to Kishida, hosted him at his private residence in Wilmington, the president's hometown in Delaware, and praised the Japanese premier for being a \"visionary and courageous\" leader over the past three years. Biden noted Kishida's leadership has made it possible for Japan to fundamentally strengthen its defense capabilities and transform its role in world affairs, the White House said. \"The two leaders committed to sustain efforts to take the U.S.-Japan alliance to new heights and to continue standing side-by-side together as steadfast global partners,\" it said. Kishida and Biden, who both took office in 2021, each decided this summer not to seek reelection amid slumping public support in their respective countries. During the meeting, which took place hours before a four-way summit of the Quad grouping also involving the leaders of Australia and India, Kishida and Biden reviewed some of their joint accomplishments and candidly discussed common challenges facing Japan and the United States, according to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. In addition to confirming the importance of passing the robust alliance to future leaders, they discussed major foreign policy issues, including China's \"coercive and destabilizing activities\" in the South China Sea and other parts of the world, according to the White House and the ministry. They said the leaders also reaffirmed that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait are essential and underscored their opposition to any attempts to change the status quo by force. Kishida agreed with Biden to continue supporting Ukraine and applying tough sanctions to Russia, as well as to deal with North Korea's evolving nuclear threats closely together and trilaterally with South Korea, according to the ministry. Kishida announced in August he will not run in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's presidential election, set to take place on Friday. Biden, who ended his bid for another four years in the White House in July, has repeatedly praised Kishida for significantly increasing Japan's defense spending amid the severe security environment in Asia. Despite the enduring conflicts in the Middle East and Ukraine, the United States continues to view China as its most consequential geopolitical challenge and the Indo-Pacific as a region of central importance for Washington's strategic interests. Under such circumstances, Japan is increasingly seen as an indispensable ally not only by the Biden administration, but also by a large majority of Democrats and Republicans. Nonetheless, Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have opposed plans by Japan's Nippon Steel Corp to acquire United States Steel Corp, siding with a powerful labor union based in a critical battleground state that could determine the U.S. presidential election in November. Former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee running against the Democrat Harris for the White House, is also against the Japanese leading steelmaker's proposed acquisition of the smaller U.S. producer, making the issue a delicate one between the two countries. Kishida stressed that Japan has contributed to the U.S. economy as the largest investor, while voicing hope to further strengthen bilateral cooperation, according to the ministry. But it remains unclear if either of them touched on the buyout plan during the meeting that lasted about an hour. On many occasions, Biden has hailed Kishida's strong commitment to support Ukraine and consistent efforts to warn that \"Ukraine today may be East Asia tomorrow,\" which has drawn global attention to the possibility of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. Biden invited Kishida to Washington as a state guest in April, during which he said the alliance has been transformed into a \"truly global partnership\" during their tenures and announced a long list of agreements with the prime minister. The agreements, focused on boosting the alliance's deterrence and facilitating its networking with like-minded partners, included working toward more integrated command and control structures between Japanese and U.S. forces. © KYODO","summary":"Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and U.S. President Joe Biden on Saturday celebrated a stronger-than-ever alliance between Tokyo and Washington in what was seen as a farewell meeting…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/politics/update3-kishida-biden-hail-stronger-japan-u.s.-ties-in-farewell-meeting","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/26/6b/b1fa671c5bb21116e8ca97c3b50c503a9add/AP24265709452014/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:17:13","author":"Japan Today Editor","authors":["Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":0.134},{"id":256941502,"title":"Is Amy Nuttall's marriage with cheating husband Andrew Buchan on the rocks AGAIN?

Email tips@dailymail.com By Bethan Edwards For Mailonline Published:22:11 BST, 21 September 2024 |Updated:22:14 BST, 21 September 2024 e-mail 2 View comments Amy Nuttall has sparked speculation her marriage with with cheating husband Andrew Buchan is on the rocks again. The Emmerdale actress, 42, ditched her wedding ring and looked emotional as she headed out on Saturday - the day after their 12th anniversary. Amy previously took back Andrew, 45, back for the third time - despite him leaving her to move in with his Better co-star Leila Farzad last year. In pictures obtained by The Sun, the Downton Abbey star cut a casual figure in a blue padded jacket which she teamed with a pair of denim jeans, but her ring was noticeably absent. MailOnline have contacted both Amy and Andrew's representatives for comment. Amy Nuttall looked emotional as she headed out and about on Saturday, on what would have been her 12th anniversary with cheating husband Andrew Buchan The actress, 42, appeared to ditch her wedding ring for the outing after previously taking Andrew, 45, back for the third time, despite him leaving her to move in with Leila Farzad The actress previously wore a gold band alongside her engagement ring Amy and Andrew first split in December 2022 when he left her for his Better co-star Leila, with the affair becoming public knowledge the following February 2023. But just weeks later, Leila returned to her husband James Maizels, while Andrew went back to his family, with The Sun reporting the actor told a friend: 'We're healing.' In July, it was claimed Amy had set her husband seven strict rules to follow after their reunion in order to rekindle their relationship. The seven rules included having full access to one another's phones and having a date night once a week and going on a couple's holiday every seven months. Amy apparently demanded weekly date nights as they followed the 777 approach, full access to each other's phones and absolutely no out of work contact with any co-stars, according to The Sun. It was reported Andrew would also need to keep in contact via FaceTime when he's working away. 'No one thought they could come back from this but Amy has decided to give it one more go,' a source told the publication. '[Amy] doesn't want to throw away over a decade together but at the same time she is far from a pushover. Andrew with Better co-star Leila Farzad, 42, with whom he had an affair pictured together in Better But just weeks later, Leila returned to her husband James Maizels Amy is renowned for playing Chloe Atkinson in Emmerdale (pictured) from 2005 to 2005 and playing housemaid Ethel Parks in Downton Abbey from 2011 until 2012 'They will adopt the 777 approach which means every seven days you go on a date, every seven weeks you go away for the night and every seven months you go away on holiday just the two of you.' The 777 approach makes up three of the rules, and the final one is that their work should be on an equal footing, it was reported. Speculation Amy and Andrew had reunited came in June when Andrew was seen leaving their family home wearing his gold wedding ring. Amy was spotted around the same time at the property, without her ring, but insiders suggested they were giving things another go. A source close to the couple told the The Sun: 'Amy was, understandably, devastated to learn of the infidelity and wanted a clean break and a fresh start. 'But Andrew has come back to her and promised to change. 'They have been working through their problems and are trying to put the love triangle behind them for the sake of their family.' They reconciled but the former Emmerdale star reportedly split from him again in August 2023 when he failed to stick to seven marriage rules she had set out to help rebuild their marriage. At the time, 'Gutted' Amy was said to have called time on their 11-year marriage and thrown him out of the family home they shared with their two children. It was originally thought that the couple were separated after Amy reportedly demanded a divorce from her husband Andrew in March last year, just weeks after news of their split emerged, but it seemed her wishes changed. After their second split in August last year, a source told The Sun : 'It took a lot for Amy to give the marriage another chance but she thought it was worth one final roll of the dice. 'There is no suggestion he has cheated again, but as far as she is concerned this is it.' Amy is renowned for playing Chloe Atkinson in Emmerdale from 2000 to 2005 and playing housemaid Ethel Parks in Downton Abbey from 2011 until 2012. She will soon grace screens in Channel 5's new six-part series The Feud, which sees families dramatically fall out over planning permission in their street. AMY NUTTALL AND ANDREW BUCHAN BREAK-UP TIMELINE December 2022 Broadchurch star Andrew Buchan leaves actress wife Amy Nuttall after developing a relationship with his Better co-star Leila Farzad. The actor reportedly moved in with Leila after both parties are believed to have left their respective partners after the affair came to light. February 15 2023 In social media posts shared to her Instagram page, Amy alluded to their split with cryptic quotes. The day after Valentine's Day she shared a pointed post that read: 'I am not impressed by money, social status or job title, I'm impressed by the way someone treats other human beings.' Days before she shared pictures from a holiday, which featured no sign of Andrew but one image with a female pal and a cute snap of herself holding hands with two children. In another hint that she was going through a tumultuous time, Amy shared a selfie drinking a cocktail at the beginning of the month, penning: 'When a pornstar martini makes life a bit better.' February 27 2023 News that Amy and Andre have split breaks in the press, as it was revealed he had left the family home and moved in with Leila. Leila married her husband James Maizels in 2013, and they have a daughter who was born in 2014. It was not known when they split. A source told the outlet: 'It was a huge shock. Amy is heartbroken. 'For Andrew to walk away from his family was a huge shock to us all – and Amy is heartbroken. Everyone who knows them thought they were going to be together forever. 'But he's packed his bags and left with his new co-star. Whatever has gone on, it seems to have been enough for him to re-evaluate his whole life and rip up their marriage. 'Nobody is quite sure of the exact details, but Andrew has clearly had his head turned pretty dramatically.' March 2 2023 In the days after stories about their separation were published online, Amy was pictured looking downcast as she told MailOnline she was 'unable' to speak about her split. Friends reported that Amy had been 'crying almost everyday' and had been left devastated by their break-up. March 27 2023 Amy reportedly demanded a divorce from her husband of 11 years Andrew weeks after news of their split emerged. The star was said to be keen to make the shocking split official by formerly ending their marriage and getting what she is 'entitled' to. After being left devastated by her husband's alleged infidelity, Amy apparently wanted to take the power back after the betrayal, while also claiming that Andrew and Leila have already parted ways. June 3 2023 Amy and Andrew are both spotted arriving at their family home, sparking rumours that they were giving their relationship another go. In a serious U-turn, which was said to be unexpected by their close friends, Andrew told pals that the couple were 'healing'. July 4 2023 Amy set her 'cheating' husband seven strict rules to follow after their reunion. She had taken Andrew back after his 'affair' - but with strings attached to help them rebuild their marriage. Amy demanded weekly date nights as they follow the 777 approach, full access to each other's phones and absolutely no out of work contact with any co-stars, according to The Sun. August 23 2023 Amy and Andrew split for a second time' after he failed to stick to the marriage rules she set for him in the wake of his 'affair'. March 31 2024 Amy confirms she is still with Andrew and the couple still own their family home together.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Bethan Edwards For Mailonline Published:22:11 BST, 21 September 2024 |Updated:22:14 BST, 21 September 2024 e-mail 2 View comments Amy Nuttall has sparked speculation her marriage with with cheating husband Andrew Buchan is on the rocks again. The Emmerdale actress, 42, ditched her wedding ring and looked emotional as she headed out on Saturday - the day after their 12th anniversary. Amy previously took back Andrew, 45, back for the third time - despite him leaving her to move in with his Better co-star Leila Farzad last year. In pictures obtained by The Sun, the Downton Abbey star cut a casual figure in a blue padded jacket which she teamed with a pair of denim jeans, but her ring was noticeably absent. MailOnline have contacted both Amy and Andrew's representatives for comment. Amy Nuttall looked emotional as she headed out and about on Saturday, on what would have been her 12th anniversary with cheating husband Andrew Buchan The actress, 42, appeared to ditch her wedding ring for the outing after previously taking Andrew, 45, back for the third time, despite him leaving her to move in with Leila Farzad The actress previously wore a gold band alongside her engagement ring Amy and Andrew first split in December 2022 when he left her for his Better co-star Leila, with the affair becoming public knowledge the following February 2023. But just weeks later, Leila returned to her husband James Maizels, while Andrew went back to his family, with The Sun reporting the actor told a friend: 'We're healing.' In July, it was claimed Amy had set her husband seven strict rules to follow after their reunion in order to rekindle their relationship. The seven rules included having full access to one another's phones and having a date night once a week and going on a couple's holiday every seven months. Amy apparently demanded weekly date nights as they followed the 777 approach, full access to each other's phones and absolutely no out of work contact with any co-stars, according to The Sun. It was reported Andrew would also need to keep in contact via FaceTime when he's working away. 'No one thought they could come back from this but Amy has decided to give it one more go,' a source told the publication. '[Amy] doesn't want to throw away over a decade together but at the same time she is far from a pushover. Andrew with Better co-star Leila Farzad, 42, with whom he had an affair pictured together in Better But just weeks later, Leila returned to her husband James Maizels Amy is renowned for playing Chloe Atkinson in Emmerdale (pictured) from 2005 to 2005 and playing housemaid Ethel Parks in Downton Abbey from 2011 until 2012 'They will adopt the 777 approach which means every seven days you go on a date, every seven weeks you go away for the night and every seven months you go away on holiday just the two of you.' The 777 approach makes up three of the rules, and the final one is that their work should be on an equal footing, it was reported. Speculation Amy and Andrew had reunited came in June when Andrew was seen leaving their family home wearing his gold wedding ring. Amy was spotted around the same time at the property, without her ring, but insiders suggested they were giving things another go. A source close to the couple told the The Sun: 'Amy was, understandably, devastated to learn of the infidelity and wanted a clean break and a fresh start. 'But Andrew has come back to her and promised to change. 'They have been working through their problems and are trying to put the love triangle behind them for the sake of their family.' They reconciled but the former Emmerdale star reportedly split from him again in August 2023 when he failed to stick to seven marriage rules she had set out to help rebuild their marriage. At the time, 'Gutted' Amy was said to have called time on their 11-year marriage and thrown him out of the family home they shared with their two children. It was originally thought that the couple were separated after Amy reportedly demanded a divorce from her husband Andrew in March last year, just weeks after news of their split emerged, but it seemed her wishes changed. After their second split in August last year, a source told The Sun : 'It took a lot for Amy to give the marriage another chance but she thought it was worth one final roll of the dice. 'There is no suggestion he has cheated again, but as far as she is concerned this is it.' Amy is renowned for playing Chloe Atkinson in Emmerdale from 2000 to 2005 and playing housemaid Ethel Parks in Downton Abbey from 2011 until 2012. She will soon grace screens in Channel 5's new six-part series The Feud, which sees families dramatically fall out over planning permission in their street. AMY NUTTALL AND ANDREW BUCHAN BREAK-UP TIMELINE December 2022 Broadchurch star Andrew Buchan leaves actress wife Amy Nuttall after developing a relationship with his Better co-star Leila Farzad. The actor reportedly moved in with Leila after both parties are believed to have left their respective partners after the affair came to light. February 15 2023 In social media posts shared to her Instagram page, Amy alluded to their split with cryptic quotes. The day after Valentine's Day she shared a pointed post that read: 'I am not impressed by money, social status or job title, I'm impressed by the way someone treats other human beings.' Days before she shared pictures from a holiday, which featured no sign of Andrew but one image with a female pal and a cute snap of herself holding hands with two children. In another hint that she was going through a tumultuous time, Amy shared a selfie drinking a cocktail at the beginning of the month, penning: 'When a pornstar martini makes life a bit better.' February 27 2023 News that Amy and Andre have split breaks in the press, as it was revealed he had left the family home and moved in with Leila. Leila married her husband James Maizels in 2013, and they have a daughter who was born in 2014. It was not known when they split. A source told the outlet: 'It was a huge shock. Amy is heartbroken. 'For Andrew to walk away from his family was a huge shock to us all – and Amy is heartbroken. Everyone who knows them thought they were going to be together forever. 'But he's packed his bags and left with his new co-star. Whatever has gone on, it seems to have been enough for him to re-evaluate his whole life and rip up their marriage. 'Nobody is quite sure of the exact details, but Andrew has clearly had his head turned pretty dramatically.' March 2 2023 In the days after stories about their separation were published online, Amy was pictured looking downcast as she told MailOnline she was 'unable' to speak about her split. Friends reported that Amy had been 'crying almost everyday' and had been left devastated by their break-up. March 27 2023 Amy reportedly demanded a divorce from her husband of 11 years Andrew weeks after news of their split emerged. The star was said to be keen to make the shocking split official by formerly ending their marriage and getting what she is 'entitled' to. After being left devastated by her husband's alleged infidelity, Amy apparently wanted to take the power back after the betrayal, while also claiming that Andrew and Leila have already parted ways. June 3 2023 Amy and Andrew are both spotted arriving at their family home, sparking rumours that they were giving their relationship another go. In a serious U-turn, which was said to be unexpected by their close friends, Andrew told pals that the couple were 'healing'. July 4 2023 Amy set her 'cheating' husband seven strict rules to follow after their reunion. She had taken Andrew back after his 'affair' - but with strings attached to help them rebuild their marriage. Amy demanded weekly date nights as they follow the 777 approach, full access to each other's phones and absolutely no out of work contact with any co-stars, according to The Sun. August 23 2023 Amy and Andrew split for a second time' after he failed to stick to the marriage rules she set for him in the wake of his 'affair'. March 31 2024 Amy confirms she is still with Andrew and the couple still own their family home together.

President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, meanwhile, appealed for quick action from the United States to send more weapons before his visit to the White House next week with a multi-point “victory plan.” Ukraine launched more than 100 drones at Russia and the occupied Crimean Peninsula overnight, Russian news reports and the Defense Ministry said Saturday. The strikes set an arms depot on fire that appeared to be in the same town as one struck by Ukrainian drones earlier this week, wounding 13 people and also causing a huge blaze. Arms and ammunition depots were also hit in Russia's southern Krasnodar region. The “victory plan” that Zelenskyy will present to U.S. President Joe Biden will include long-range strike capabilities and other weapons long sought by Kyiv, and will serve as the basis for any future negotiation with Russia, Zelenskyy told reporters. Zelenskyy has regularly alluded to the plan’s preparation, but hasn't publicly outlined its contents, saying only that it contains terms acceptable for Ukraine to negotiate with Russia. “This will be the start and foundation for talking in any format with Russia. In any format, with any of its representatives, because there will be a plan and something to show,\" Zelenskyy said in a briefing Friday. Zelenskyy said he will present the plan to Biden and Kamala Harris, the U.S. vice president and presidential candidate. Zelenskyy said that he also plans to meet with Harris' opponent in the November election, former President Donald Trump. He said U.S. reluctance so far to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike deep inside Russia stems from fears of escalation from Moscow, a major global nuclear power. Ukraine has had to use its own capabilities to conduct strikes inside Russian territory. “I think that Biden is really getting information from his entourage today that there may be an escalation. But, and this is important, not everyone around him thinks so. And this is already an achievement that not all of his entourage thinks so,” Zelenskyy said. But the longer Western partners wait to allow the use of long-range missiles, the more tactically obsolete their value will become, Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy's remarks came shortly before he is set to kick off a busy week in in the United States shoring up support for Ukraine in the war. He is expected to address the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York and travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. Ukraine’s Western backers have routinely been criticized for only helping the country to survive the invasion, rather than win, out of concern for the chaos that it might cause in Russia should Putin fall. The plan could be an attempt to change that calculus. Beyond making demands of Biden, Ukraine is likely to seek detailed commitments from European allies as well. Zelenskyy said Thursday without elaborating that its success will rely on quick decisions by “a number of actors” between October and December. Trump has said he would end the war immediately if he wins, and many in Ukraine and Europe fear that it won't be on favorable terms for Kyiv. Also on Saturday, Ukraine's General Staff said that “at least 2,000 tons” of weaponry, including missiles supplied by North Korea, were destroyed in a nighttime drone strike that targeted depots in Russia's south and northwest. Russian authorities on Saturday temporarily closed a 100-kilometer (62-mile) stretch of a highway and evacuated passengers from a rail station after a blaze caused a series of explosions near the town of Toropets, in Russia’s Tver region, about 380 kilometers (240 miles) northwest of Moscow and 500 kilometers (300 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Posts on local Telegram channels said a missile depot was struck this week near Toropets, the site of the attack that struck a large arms storehouse, causing a huge blaze and prompting evacuations. It wasn't immediately clear whether the same depot was struck again. Unverified images circulating on Telegram on Saturday showed a large ball of flame rising into the night sky and dozens of smoke trails from detonations. In its latest regular intelligence update, the UK defense ministry called the Toropets site “one of Russia's largest strategic ammunition depots directly supporting its operation in Ukraine\" and said that a strike reported on Wednesday likely caused “enormous losses of ordnance.” The update, posted on X, referenced reports of North Korean missiles being stored at Toropets, but didn't independently confirm it. An ammunition depot and missile arsenal in southwestern Russia also caught fire in a separate attack Saturday in the Krasnodar region, triggering evacuations after the blaze caused a series of blasts near the town of Tikhoretsk. Videos on social media showed bright orange clouds rising over the horizon, as dull thuds of detonations sounded almost continuously. Russian state media described clouds of smoke rising from two sites near Tikhoretsk, and authorities later announced a state of emergency around the town. Regional officials in both provinces attributed the blazes to falling shrapnel from drones downed by Russian air defense. Russia’s Defense Ministry said early Saturday that its forces overnight shot down 101 Ukrainian drones over Russian territory and occupied Crimea. There were no immediate reports of casualties in either Russian region. A separate Ukrainian drone strike on Saturday wounded a tractor driver in Russia’s southern Belgorod region and left several villages without electricity, Gov. Vyacheslav Gladkov reported. In Ukraine, a 12-year-old boy and two older women were killed as Russian missiles overnight struck Kryvyi Rih, Zelenskyy’s hometown in central Ukraine, local Gov. Serhii Lysak reported Saturday. Lysak said the missiles hit “in the middle of the night, when the city slept,” wounding three more people, destroying two buildings and damaging another 20. In Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, 15 people including young teens were wounded by Russian airstrikes on Friday evening, Mayor Ihor Terekhov said, more than twice as many as initially reported. Shortly after the strike, Terekhov said that seven civilians, including three children, were hurt after Russian Su-34 fighters dropped guided precision bombs on three Kharkiv districts. Russian drone and artillery strikes Saturday also wounded at least three civilians in Ukraine’s southern Kherson region, local officials reported, while a fourth was wounded after an airstrike hit the northern city of Sumy.

But Trump will be campaigning in Wilmington, along the state's southern coast, without Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, the GOP gubernatorial nominee and one of the former president's top surrogates in the state, following a CNN report about his alleged posts on a pornography website’s message board. Two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity said Friday that Robinson was not scheduled to attend the Wilmington event. Robinson has denied writing the posts, which include lewd and racist comments, saying Thursday that he wouldn’t be forced out of the race by “salacious tabloid lies.” Trump's campaign has appeared to distance itself from Robinson in the wake of the CNN reporting, which the AP has not independently verified, saying in statement to the AP that Trump “is focused on winning the White House and saving this country\" and calling North Carolina “a vital part of that plan,\" without mentioning Robinson. While Robinson won his GOP gubernatorial primary in March, he’s been trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the state’s attorney general. State Republican officials have stood by Robinson, whose decision to keep campaigning could threaten GOP prospects in other key races, including Trump’s efforts in a battleground state he previously won twice. Democrats have seized on the opportunity to highlight Trump's ties to Robinson, with billboards showing the two together, as well as a new ad from Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign highlighting the Republican candidates' ties as well as Robinson's support for a statewide abortion ban without exceptions. According to Harris' campaign, it's their first ad effort related to tying Trump to a down-ballot race. A Republican has carried North Carolina in every general election since 1976 save one, when Barack Obama won the state in 2008. Trump won there in both his previous campaigns but by less than 1.5 percentage points over Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, the closest margin of any state that Trump won. That's part of why Democrats see the state as winnable this fall. With neither Senate seat up for grabs, the gubernatorial contest has been North Carolina's marquee down-ballot race this year. Robinson has become a natural top surrogate for Trump in the state and a frequent presence at campaign events there, appearing with the nominee as recently as an event last month in Asheboro. Trump has long praised Robinson, who is Black, referring to him as “Martin Luther King on steroids.\" Endorsing Robinson ahead of the GOP gubernatorial primary, Trump continued: “I think you’re better than Martin Luther King. I think you are Martin Luther King times two.” While more visits have been made by presidential contenders to the Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, both Harris and Trump have made multiple trips to North Carolina, highlighting the state’s importance. Following Biden’s departure from the race in July, Trump held his first large-scale rally there, turning his full focus toward Harris. Wilmington is home to New Hanover County, which Biden won in 2020. But his margin over Trump in the county was among his slimmest in the state. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

When Biden began his presidency he looked to elevate the so-called Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend’s summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. “It will survive way beyond November,” Biden declared as the leaders gathered at the Archmere Academy, his high school alma mater in nearby Claymont for joint talks. The president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner. “I don’t think the headmaster of this school thought I’d be presiding over a meeting like this,” Biden joked to fellow leaders. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. “This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,” said Kishida, who like Biden, is set to soon leave office. Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. Kishida, according to the prime minister’s office, thanked Biden at the outset of their meeting for inviting him to meet at his home. White House officials said holding the talks at the president’s house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel. White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan described the vibe of Biden’s one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as “two guys — one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.” He said Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him “insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.” Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks at Archmere. “There cannot be a better place than President Biden’s hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,” Modi said. Reporters and photographers were prohibited from covering Biden’s individual meetings with the leaders, and Biden does not plan to do a news conference — a question-and-answer appearance that is typical at such international summits. As part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. Biden and Modi had been expected to discuss Modi’s recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sullivan said “that countries like India should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity” and that “every country, everywhere, should refrain from supplying inputs to Russia’s war machine.” The gathering was also an opportunity for Biden and Japan’s Kishida to bid each other farewell. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The two leaders sat down for their wide-ranging, one-on-one conversation on Saturday morning. The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and increasing Chinese assertiveness. Biden commended Kishida for demonstrating “courage and conviction in strengthening ties” with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China’s “coercive and destabilizing activities” in the Pacific, Russia’s war against Ukraine and emerging technology issues. The U.S. and Japan are negotiating through a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Biden, as well as presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel. Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee’s formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the Nov. 5 election. Sullivan pushed back against speculation that the expected timing of the report could suggest Biden is having second thoughts about his opposition to the deal. The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries. The White House said the leaders later Saturday will rollout a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific. The announcement is related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths. The Bidens’ son Beau died in 2015 at age 46 of brain cancer. As Biden’s time in office draws down, the White House also was celebrating the bipartisan, bicameral formation of a “Quad Caucus” in Congress meant to ensure the longevity of the partnership regardless of the outcome of the November election.","summary":"President Joe Biden is showcasing the Indo-Pacific partnership he nurtured since taking office.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/09/21/biden-declares-quad-is-here-to-stay-as-he-hosts-indo-pacific-leaders-for-summit-in-his-hometown/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2024/09/Biden_Quad_68379.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:09:49","author":"Zeke Miller And Aamer Madhani,ZEKE MILLER and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press","authors":["Zeke Miller And Aamer Madhani","ZEKE MILLER and AAMER MADHANI - Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.074},{"id":256913206,"title":"Harris ‘too busy’ to talk to media – adviser","text":"US Vice President Kamala Harris hasn’t given many media interviews because “she’s a very busy person,” one of her campaign advisers, Keisha Lance-Bottoms, has told CNN. Even liberal pundits have criticized Harris for dodging the spotlight. In the two months since she announced her presidential campaign, Harris and running mate Tim Walz have given a total of seven sit-down interviews, while former President Donald Trump and running mate J.D. Vance have given 70 interviews and press conferences, according to a tally compiled by Axios this week. When conversations with partisan allies – for instance Trump’s live chat with X owner Elon Musk – are counted, the former president pulls even further ahead of Harris, who has largely stuck to scripted rallies to reach voters. Asked why Harris is not doing more interviews, Lance-Bottoms told CNN on Friday that “we would love to see her sit down every single day with CNN and do interviews, but it’s that she’s a very busy person.” “She’s the vice president as well as a candidate,” Lance-Bottoms continued, reiterating that Harris is simply “too busy” to match Trump’s media schedule. Harris has come under fire from the New York Times for avoiding unscripted appearances, while CNN commentator Scott Jennings hammered the vice president on Friday for deliberately avoiding “hostile media.” The night before, Harris spoke at length to TV host Oprah Winfrey, although the interview was friendly and featured a host of Harrris’ celebrity supporters, including Meryl Streep, Jennifer Lopez, Julia Roberts, Chris Rock, and Ben Stiller. Harris’ campaign believes that “limiting interactions with the press is the right strategy – even if it frustrates reporters,” Axios reported, citing sources close to the campaign. According to a recent New York Times/Siena poll, 31% of voters feel that they don’t know enough about Harris, while only 12% are unsure who Trump is or where he stands on key issues.","summary":"The US vice president is a busy person who doesn’t have time for interviews, one of her campaign advisers has claimed \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/604443-kamala-harris-avoiding-media/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2024.09/article/66ef33a285f54048b219ee27.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-21 21:09:28","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.036}]}
