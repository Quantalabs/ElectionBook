Joe Manchin, I-W.Va., wanted Republicans to win the Senate last year in order to prevent Democrats’ pursuit of \"raw political power.\" In his new book, \"Dead Center: In Defense of Common Sense,\" set to be released on Tuesday and obtained by Fox News Digital, the former West Virginia Democrat-turned-Independent ripped into his ex-political party, tore into former Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden and blasted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., while lauding the relationship that he had with President Donald Trump. Manchin made waves when he and former Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who also left the Democratic Party to become an Independent, bucked Schumer and voted against the move to nuke the Senate filibuster in 2022. SCHUMER SILENT AS VAN HOLLEN BLASTS 'SPINELESS' NY DEMOCRATS OVER MAMDANI SNUB He recalled that vote in his book and the pressure he felt from Schumer and Senate Democrats to fall in line on that and other key votes during Biden’s presidency. Manchin accused Schumer of wanting a vote he \"could broadcast to the radical left to prove his loyalty\" and said the then-Senate majority leader didn’t actually believe that getting rid of the filibuster was the right thing to do, but rather to fulfill his \"only priority\" of maintaining control of the Senate. \"Because of what I knew — and what I had seen firsthand — I wanted Republicans to win the Senate majority in 2024,\" Manchin wrote. \"I believed it was the only hope for preserving the Senate as an institution. I truly believed that, if in power, Republicans would uphold the filibuster, the last guardrail preventing total partisan rule.\" DEMOCRATS FRET RETURN OF JOE BIDEN, KAMALA HARRIS TO SPOTLIGHT AS PARTY TRIES TO 'TURN THE PAGE': REPORT \"Schumer and the Democrats had already shown their hand — eliminating the filibuster would have been their first order of business,\" he continued. \"They had no interest in protecting the Senate’s role as the deliberative body. They only cared about raw political power.\" The quest to end the filibuster is also why Manchin wouldn’t endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris in her run against Trump. \"She knew this was the Holy Grail and the only hope we have to preserve any bipartisanship and maintain our democracy,\" Manchin said. He also outlined an early fight he had with Biden where, when Democrats were trying to ram through the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan in the early months of his presidency in an evenly-divided Senate, Manchin rejected it. Biden ripped into Manchin for standing in the way of an early victory. EX-NBC NEWS HOST CHUCK TODD LAMENTS DEMOCRATIC PARTY A 'COLLECTION OF PEOPLE THAT DON'T LIKE TRUMP' \"As the drama began, I got a call from the president, and was he hot,\" Manchin wrote. \"'If you kill this f— bill, I will never speak to you again,’ he promised. Anyone who knows Joe Biden —- and I have known him for a very long time —-knows he’s got a very bad temper. He calls it his ‘Irish.’ I call it unfortunate. But if he was going there, so was I.\" \"'Your actions are reckless,' I spat back. ‘You’re sending a f—- check to everyone. And if you missed anyone, it was only by mistake.’\" The legislation ultimately passed after a compromise was reached, but Manchin noted that he later regretted \"capitulating on the American Rescue Plan.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP He also described having a far better relationship with Trump, who he considered a fellow \"outsider,\" than Obama, and noted that Obama reached out to him twice during his entire presidency: once after he won re-election to the Senate in 2012 and again in 2015 to persuade him from voting against his nuclear deal with Iran. \"From the start, President Trump had an open line of communication with me. I spoke to him more in the first two years of his presidency than I did to President Obama during all eight years of his time in office,\" Manchin said. Fox News Digital reached out to the offices of Schumer, Obama and Biden for comment but did not immediately hear back.","summary":"Former Sen.

Joe Manchin on Monday about why he did not endorse Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. Navarro asked, \"What was your issue with Kamala Harris, and now as you look back, and we are where we are, do you still stand by that decision?\" Manchin said his opposition stemmed from Harris’ support for eliminating the Senate filibuster. \"I do, because she openly came out and said she would get rid of the filibuster,\" Manchin told the co-hosts. 'THE VIEW' CO-HOST DESCRIBES HARRIS INTERVIEW AS 'MICROCOSM OF EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG' WITH DEMOCRATIC PARTY \"I know everybody has a different view. The filibuster is basically there to protect us from being singular, basically being a simple minority,\" he said. \"If you're a simple minority with a 51-vote threshold, and all you need is one more, OK, if it's 50-50 here, and one person, that's 51%, that doesn't basically give you any cohesion the way you're going to have anything that'll last.\" Manchin argued the U.S. would risk flip-flopping on policy like \"Europe\" or other governments around the world. \"The Senate is the most unusual body.

Harris said during a September 2024 interview that she supported eliminating the filibuster to pass abortion laws. \"I think we should eliminate the filibuster for Roe,\" Harris said on the \"Wisconsin Today\" show in September 2024. \"And get us to the point where 51 votes would be what we need to actually put back in law the protections for reproductive freedom and for the ability of every person and every woman to make decisions about their own body and not have their government tell them what to do.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Manchin retired at the end of 2024 after serving 14 years in the Senate.

Today, our national politics are broken and neither party is willing to compromise to find common ground.

The two-day meeting, which wrapped up on Monday, was the latest in a slew of negotiations that began in May.\n\n“We’re not going to talk about the commercial terms of the deal. It’s between two private parties, but the commercial terms have been agreed upon,” US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters.\n\nBessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer, who was also part of the trade delegation in Madrid, said China wanted concessions on trade and technology in exchange for agreeing to divest from the popular social media app.\n\n“Our Chinese counterparts have come with a very aggressive ask,” Bessent said, adding, “We are not willing to sacrifice national security for a social media app.”\n\n“TikTok’s divestment agreement not only keeps the app running in the US, but is also expected to help de-escalate a tense trade standoff and lay groundwork for further trade talks between the US and China,” Maria Pechurina, director of international trade at Peacock Tariff Consulting, told Al Jazeera. “Both US and Chinese delegations explicitly linked the fate of TikTok to progress on tariff reductions and related trade concessions during their conversations in Madrid.”\n\nThe deal comes despite the US pushing other nations to impose tariffs on China over purchases of Russian oil, which Bessent said was discussed briefly with the US’s Chinese counterparts.\n\nExperts warn to be wary of the deal being set until Xi and Trump speak on Friday.\n\n“It’s important to note that the Chinese often see the signing of a deal as the beginning, and not the end, of any negotiations. The devil would lie in the details behind the optics. Also expect much haggling on important details that may take years,” Usha Hayley, a professor of international business at Wichita State University who specialises in Chinese industry, told Al Jazeera.\n\n“The deal, when reached, would reflect the convergence of technology, national security, and geopolitics,” said Hayley. “TikTok sits at the centre of US concerns about data access, influence over public discourse, and Beijing’s reach into global tech. Washington is stating that the US views digital platforms as strategic assets, not private businesses.”\n\nTikTok did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.\n\nThe looming ban\n\nTrump proposed banning TikTok during his first term as US president, signing two executive orders in August 2020 that were aimed at restricting the app.\n\nIn April 2024, under then-President Joe Biden, the White House signed a law formally banning TikTok unless it sold its US operations. The ban was supposed to take effect on January 19, the last day of the Biden administration. Biden said he would not enforce the ban and said that he would leave that decision to the next administration.\n\nTwo days before the January deadline, on January 17, the Supreme Court stepped in to weigh in on TikTok’s challenge to the law and upheld the law. The app went dark briefly before the ban was paused during the early days of Trump’s subsequent presidency.\n\nThe pause was initially for 90 days and was later extended multiple times throughout the year.\n\nThe cultural importance to Trump\n\nTikTok’s cultural relevance has grown significantly in recent years, serving both as a tool for organising and activism, and as a platform to reach the public, particularly young voters. In April 2024, the pro-Trump videos on TikTok were nearly double those supporting Biden, who was then the Democratic nominee, the New York Times reported, citing TikTok’s internal data.\n\nTrump’s broader use of newer media was widely cited as a factor in his 2024 election victory. His campaign regularly engaged with right-leaning podcasts and influencers — such as Joe Rogan and Theo Von — to reach conservative audiences. It also targeted disillusioned men, who were drawn to influencers promoting traditional notions of masculinity, often conflated with conservative viewpoints.\n\nA Pew Research Center study from November found that news influencers — defined as those who discuss “current events and civic issues” and have at least 100,000 followers across any social media platform – are more likely to lean conservative. A separate report from Pew in February found that news influencers posted more content supporting Trump than former Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s 2024 election opponent: 28 percent for Trump versus 24 percent for Harris.\n\nTikTok’s role in spreading far-right narratives is not limited to US politics. The platform has reportedly influenced German state elections, contributing to the rise of far-right leaders, and has similarly affected far-right candidates in Poland, Sweden, and France.","summary":"The app would have gone dark if China’s ByteDance had not divested by Wednesday.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/9/15/tiktok-ban-in-flux-as-white-house-announces-china-us-framework-deal?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2025-08-29T113638Z_765241381_RC22BGA59QJX_RTRMADP_3_EGYPT-TIKTOK-RIGHTS-1757960630.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 19:30:25","author":"Andy Hirschfeld,Apps Support","authors":["Andy Hirschfeld","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.209},{"id":360792468,"title":"'Tremendous pressure': GOP senator predicts party will fold over rural hospital closures","text":"President Donald Trump's signature domestic policy law's cuts to Medicaid is already wreaking havoc on rural hospitals — particularly in some of the reddest states.

Jasmine Crockett has repeatedly used “Hitler” to refer to the president, including after Kirk’s assassination on Wednesday. Turrentine said on the 2WAY show that such heated and misleading rhetoric can incite violence and that now is the time to acknowledge it. (RELATED: ‘I Did See Him Fall’: Jason Chaffetz Provides Eyewitness Account Of Charlie Kirk Shooting)\n\n“[T]he party should not call Trump Hitler, should not say he’s a fascist. One, it’s bad politics. Two, it’s just not true. Right? It is simply not the case,” Turrentine said. “And I think that whenever a bad thing happens, parties need to call out in real time, ‘This is not acceptable.’ And I wish that one of our 2028-ers would come out and be more explicit.”\n\nThe former Democratic strategist praised independent Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders for doing “a great job” in his video on the assassination, wherein he denounced political violence. However, Turrentine argued his party needs to go further.\n\n“[T]he next step is some of these leaders: ‘I am wrong or was wrong … we all need to lower the temperature. And I’m going to do my part by saying we got to knock this crap off.’ Win in the marketplace of ideas, win at the ballot box,” Turrentine said. “But don’t say we have to destroy the other side and stop it because it’s Hitler, because I agree with [House Speaker Mike Johnson]. Crazy people hear that and think, ‘I have to do my part.'”\n\nCrockett on “The Breakfast Club” Friday justified calling Trump a “wannabe Hitler” by attacking the president’s rhetoric and claiming hers was “not necessarily” inciting violence.\n\n“Me disagreeing with you, me calling you a wannabe Hitler, all those things are like not necessarily saying ‘Go out and hurt somebody,'” Crockett said.\n\nTrump survived two assassination attempts during his 2024 presidential campaign, one during a July 13, 2024, rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the other on Sept. 15, 2024, while he was playing a round of golf in Florida.\n\nKirk was assassinated on Wednesday while speaking to a large crowd at Utah Valley University (UVU), during which he engaged in civil debate with students.

And it’s these supposed “facts” that caused him to murder Kirk.\n\n“It now appears that the person who shot and killed right-wing political commentator Charlie Kirk was like the majority of shooters in America: a young white male from a conservative, pro-gun, religious background,” she said.\n\n“After being told for two straight days that the left had ‘declared war on America,’ that the shooter was most likely trans, or in Congresswoman Nancy Mace’s words, ‘pro-tranny.’ After the Wall Street Journal published an article, they had to later walk back that the bullets had a pro-trans message because it turned out to be just the markings of one of the world’s biggest ammunition factories; they were wrong,” she continued, adding, “We still don’t know the motivation for the killing, but we will find out more in the coming days.”\n\n I have something to say about the Charlie Kirk murder. pic.twitter.com/N3P7crTKBH — PoliticsGirl (@IAmPoliticsGirl) September 12, 2025\n\nThis is the prevailing narrative for much of the left. Yes, early reports were that Robinson could possibly be yet another transgender violent killer. And for good reason. Republican Utah Gov. Spencer Cox confirmed that “Bella Chao,” the name of a song which has become a far-left battle cry, was engraved on one of the bullet casings of Kirk’s assassin.\n\nJournalist Andy Ngo, who has been a frequent target of Antifa and far-left transgender attacks, explains the importance of the evidence left behind that links Robinson to radical, violent movements. (Sign up for Mary Rooke’s weekly newsletter here!)\n\n“It’s hard for me to overstate the significance of the Charlie Kirk assassin suspect allegedly putting the lyrics of ‘Bella Ciao’ on a rifle cartridge. That is probably the most important rallying song to Antifa militants for decades. The 2019 Tacoma Antifa gunman cited it in his manifesto before carrying out a deadly shooting and explosives attack at an ICE facility,” Ngo said.\n\nDuring a vigil for Charlie Kirk in New York City, a far-left activist was recorded singing “Bella Ciao” and allegedly threatened to kill NYU College Republican Club President Ryan Leonard, according to a post made by the organization.\n\n Protesters sung the song written on the bullet casings which killed Charlie Kirk at the vigil mourning his death tonight at NYU. They also threatened to kill NYU College Republican Club president Ryan Leonard. They’re not looking for peace. pic.twitter.com/m9x8vuPHID — NYU College Republicans (@nyurepublicans) September 15, 2025\n\nRobinson was reportedly in a “romantic” relationship with a transgender-identified man, and his family, friends, and acquaintances claim that he had become radicalized by far-left ideologies, frequently espousing anti-Kirk sentiments and anti-conservative ideas at gatherings.\n\nBut the left isn’t just trying to blame Kirk’s murder on the right. They’ve blamed Kirk’s speech, often resulting in seemingly libelous and defamatory statements about Kirk after his death, with several preemptive apologies, retractions, and even firings as a result of outrage over their comments.\n\nAdditionally, the left has tried to claim that even if one of their own is responsible for Kirk’s murder, the rise in political violence is not their fault, pointing to several instances they claim are evidence of right-wing violence. (ROOKE: Did Your Pastor Say Anything About Charlie Kirk Or Iryna Zarutska On Sunday?)\n\nA popular case is that of the killings of Democratic Wisconsin state Rep. Melissa Hortman and state Sen. John Hoffman, both shot and killed in June. Their alleged killer, Vance Boelter, reportedly voted in the 2024 Republican primary, and his roommate, David Carlson, claims that Boelter voted for President Donald Trump in 2024.\n\nWisconsin is an open primary state, meaning you do not have to be a registered Republican to vote in the GOP primary. A common move in open-primary states is switching parties for the primary in order to vote for an opponent that your party’s candidate would have an easier time defeating. There’s no way to tell if that is what happened in this case.\n\nAnother interesting fact the left seemingly ignores or doesn’t know is that authorities found far-left, anti-Trump posters in his car during the investigation. He was also appointed to a state board by Kamala Harris’s running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.\n\n ABBY PHILLIP: “I just want to note, though, I mean, you cannot omit just a couple of months ago, democratic Minnesota State Representatives were assassinated.” REP GONZALES: “By a left wing lunatic” Vance Boelter was a Walz appointee with “No Kings” flyers in his car. pic.twitter.com/Q6jqd4zeXY — Thomas Hern (@ThomasMHern) September 12, 2025\n\nFor the governor’s mansion arson perpetrated on Democratic Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Cody Balmer had no party affiliation and held murky views critical of both parties. But Balmer’s motive against Shapiro was clear: he supported the Palestinians’ effort during the Gaza War and hated that Shapiro was Jewish and supposedly supported Israel. These are not opinions held by the majority of conservatives, but rather, they are more commonly found in stench-filled far-left protests carried out on college campuses.\n\nThe left is going to have to grapple with the reality that their demonization of conservatives in this country and the support of violence against us got a man killed. A good man who supported their right to hold views opposite to his, and simply wanted to have conversations with them in hopes it would change their minds.\n\nNot just that, but these heinous acts on Shapiro, Hortman, and Hoffman were not celebrated in mass by conservatives. The majority of leftists did not wake up the day after the Wisconsin killings or the Shapiro arson to see their friends, family, local teachers, and health professionals excusing or championing the violence. But conservatives witnessed just that with their fellow Americans, people they considered close, as way too many celebrated Kirk’s murder and egged on similar atrocities. (ROOKE: Don’t Lose Sight Of The People Most Affected By The Loss Of Charlie Kirk)\n\nThe left’s movement is violent, destructive, and antithetical to American ideals.

It’s also the big, undiscussed storyline behind all the media leaks that Padilla, California’s senior U.S. senator, is considering a run for governor next year.\n\nIf Padilla were to join the gubernatorial race, he’d become a favorite in a weak field of seven Democrats (currently led by former Congresswoman Katie Porter, of Orange County) and two Republicans (a scandal-plagued county sheriff and a former Fox News host from England).\n\nIf Padilla were to win the governorship, he’d succeed the term-limited Newsom at the end of 2026.\n\nThis is when the swap would come in. As the new governor, Padilla would get to fill the open Senate seat — to appoint his own successor, who could serve for two years, until the 2028 election.\n\nWhat if Newsom wanted the Senate opening? If he did, Padilla would be all but certain to appoint him to it. The two men are allies and share some political advisors. Most of all, Padilla owes Newsom, who appointed Padilla to the Senate in 2021, when Kamala Harris’ election to the vice presidency vacated the seat.\n\nHere’s guessing that Newsom will find some value in a two-year Senate term, in 2027 and 2028.\n\nThe seat would give Newsom an official post from which to continue his relentless fight against Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And it would provide the former governor both Washington experience and an East Coast home base in his likely run for the Democratic presidential primary nomination in 2028.\n\nShould he fail to get the nod from the party—or if it becomes apparent that an authoritarian Trump administration won’t allow 2028 to be a free and fair election—Newsom could run for election to the Senate seat in 2028. \n\nSo, now that I’ve outlined the political path to Gov. Padilla and Sen. Newsom, I’ll ask: Would this be good for California?\n\nThat’s a harder question. Padilla, an MIT graduate, might be the smartest person in California politics. And Newsom is perhaps the country’s most energetic politician, a ceaseless producer of both creative ideas and dumb blunders.\n\nBut political swaps like this are hardball insider moves that inspire cynicism and can backfire with the public. Especially if it begins to seem as if elites, not Californians, are picking our rulers, as the veteran Los Angeles political strategist Dan Schnur warned in a recent piece about redistriting, “When Voters Don’t Matter.”\n\nThe perception that the voters no longer matter is growing, with Newsom, Padilla, and other Democrats pushing a partisan gerrymander on this November’s special election ballot (Prop 50, which would add five Democratic seats in the House of Representatives). A Padilla-Newsom switch on top of that proposition might be tempting fate.\n\nThere is precedent for a high-profile California political swap going unexpectedly south.\n\nIn 1958, Republicans were nearly as dominant in California government as the Democrats are now. Since 1896, only one Democrat had been elected governor (the atheist Culbert Olson, in an electoral accident).\n\nGov. Goodwin Knight, a popular Republican moderate from Los Angeles, was preparing to run for re-election in 1958. But California’s senior senator, the conservative Republican William Knowland, owner of the Oakland Tribune, announced that he would challenge Knight for governor.\n\nKnowland saw the governorship as a better perch from which to run for president in 1960, according to the author Miriam Pawel. Knowland also wanted to block his rival California Republican, Richard Nixon, from the presidency.\n\nUnder pressure from Knowland allies, Gov. Knight dropped out of the governor’s race to make way for Sen. Knowland. Knight then joined the race to fill Knowland’s Senate seat.\n\nThis swap of campaigns was dubbed “The Big Switch.” And it backfired spectacularly. The Democrats, led by their gubernatorial candidate, Pat Brown, argued that Republicans were playing political games and taking voters for granted.\n\nThe election saw record turnout. Both Knowland and Knight lost, in twin upsets that ended their political careers. The era of Republican dominance of state government was over.\n\nToday’s overconfident California Democrats may dismiss this history. But Newsom and Padilla may be playing political musical chairs at a time of historic volatility in our state and country. The Republicans’ robust embrace of authoritarianism has put the very republic at risk. And the Democratic party is losing ground, as Latinos, men, and the young see it as weak and ineffectual.\n\nCalifornia’s political ground is shaking and shifting beneath our feet. Big plans and big swaps could bear fruit — or backfire, as coalitions rise and fall.\n\nPadilla and Newsom might switch their way into extending Democratic dominance in California, as they continue the righteous fight against Trumpism.\n\nOr, with too much political maneuvering, they could lose it all.\n\nJoe Mathews writes the Connecting California column for Zócalo Public Square, an ASU Media Enterprise publication.","summary":"Gov.

His comment, which drew mounting criticism after spreading online, came hours before the murder of Charlie Kirk sparked nationwide condemnation of calls for political violence and demands from Kirk’s conservative allies to fire people who make light of his death.\n\nWho said what\nKilmeade made his comment during a discussion about what to do with homeless people who rejected government intervention, after a conversation about a mentally ill man in North Carolina who fatally stabbed Ukrainian refugee Iryna Zarutska. His co-host Lawrence Jones suggested that homeless people needed to be “locked up in jail” if they refused mental health care. “Or, involuntary lethal injection — or something,” Kilmeade said. “Just kill ’em.”\n\nKilmeade yesterday apologized for his “extremely callous remark.” He said he was “obviously aware that not all mentally ill, homeless people act as the perpetrator did in North Carolina, and that so many homeless people deserve our empathy and compassion.” Kilmeade’s “rare on-air apology” also served as Fox News’ response to the controversy, The Washington Post said, citing network spokespeople. \n\nKilmeade’s continued employment at Fox News stood “in sharp contrast” with the sacking of commentators “deemed to have made offensive comments about Kirk’s death,” notably MSNBC analyst Matthew Dowd, said The Guardian. The GOP warning to mourn Kirk “respectfully or suffer the consequences” has already led to at least 15 people losing their jobs or being suspended, Reuters said, and the “campaign to fire Kirk’s critics has not slowed.”\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Poland last week shot down at least three of 19 Russian drones sent deep into its airspace, in NATO’s first military engagement with Russia during the Ukraine war. But Romania said its F-16s decided it was safer to only monitor the drone there. \n\nWho said what\nRussia claimed last week’s incursion over Poland was an accident and President Donald Trump also suggested it “could have been a mistake,” but Poland, other NATO countries and security analysts said Moscow was deliberately testing NATO’s resolve and defenses.\n\nTrump said Saturday he was “ready to do major sanctions on Russia when all NATO nations” have stopped “buying oil from Russia.” Most NATO nations did so after Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine, but not Turkey, Hungary and Slovakia, all of which are “led by Trump allies,” The Washington Post said. “Instead of looking for a solution,” former Lithuanian foreign minister Gabrielius Landsbergis told the Post, Trump seems to be “looking for a way out.”\n\nTrump, who is “resisting congressional plans to impose newer and tougher penalties on Russia’s energy sector,” also pushed NATO allies to slap steep tariffs on China for buying Russian oil, The Wall Street Journal said. Russia “remains the world’s second-largest oil exporter,” The Associated Press said, but Moscow has “paused gasoline exports” amid shortages from rising demand and “sustained Ukrainian drone strikes” on its oil refineries, including a hit early Sunday on the large Kirishi refinery outside St. Petersburg.\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

We must deter future illegal immigration and give our law enforcement and border patrol officers the tools they need to hold dangerous criminals accountable,\" Bice told Fox News Digital. House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., the No. 3 House GOP leader, criticized the Democrats who voted against the bill. \"House Democrats seem to still be taking their marching orders from Joe Biden and his failed Border Czar Kamala Harris. The fact that Democrats voted against commonsense penalties for people entering our nation illegally just goes to show that they’ve learned nothing since November,\" Emmer told Fox News Digital. \"They are continuing to double down on their pro-illegal alien, anti-American agenda.\" As the Minnesota Republican pointed out, border security and illegal immigration proved potent issues for the GOP in the 2024 election. Bice’s bill would mandate a sentence of five years to life in prison for someone who illegally enters the U.S. and is subsequently convicted of a felony. It would also increase the maximum prison sentence for illegal entry from two years to five years, while increasing the maximum term for someone who comes illegally, despite being previously denied entry from two years to 10 years. Among the Democrats who supported the bill is moderate Rep. Laura Gillen, D-N.Y., who called the legislation \"commonsense\" in a statement to the media. 148 DEMOCRATS BACK NONCITIZEN VOTING IN DC AS GOP RAISES ALARM ABOUT FOREIGN AGENTS CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"Americans overwhelmingly agree that violent criminals without legal status have no place in our country and should be held accountable to the full extent of our nation’s immigration laws,\" Gillen said. \"The previous administration’s inaction on the border led to a full-blown crisis that drained taxpayers’ wallets and made our communities less safe.\" The remaining 10 Democrats who voted for the bill are: Reps. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas, Don Davis, D-N.C., Jared Golden, D-Maine, Vicente Gonzalez, D-Texas, Adam Gray, D-Calif., Kristen McDonald Rivet, D-Mich., Frank Mrvan, D-Ind., Marie Gluesenkamp Perez, D-Wash., Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., and Gabe Vasquez, D-N.M.

A federal judge blocked Trump’s attempt last week, saying his unproven allegations that Cook committed mortgage fraud before joining the Fed were not sufficient cause to fire her. Newly unearthed documents also undermined Trump’s allegations.\n\nWho said what\nThe push to remove Cook has “quickly become the defining battle in Trump’s effort to take control of the Fed,” which Congress crafted in the 1930s to “insulate presidentially appointed governors from political pressure,” The Wall Street Journal said. This is the “first time in the central bank’s 112-year history that a president has tried to fire a governor,” The Associated Press said.\n\nJustice Department lawyers yesterday told the federal appeals court that Trump had “reasonable” cause to fire Cook and his decision was “an unreviewable exercise of the discretion Congress vested” in the president. Cook’s lawyers disagreed in a filing Saturday and argued that the “era of Fed independence would be over” if Trump could fire Fed governors on such “flimsy pretexts.”\n\nCook’s attorneys also pointed to a Reuters report, later confirmed by other major news organizations, that she listed her Atlanta condo as a “vacation home” and “second home” on two mortgage documents. Trump’s justification for firing her rests on allegations from his mortgage regulator Bill Pulte that she listed that condo and a Michigan house as “primary” residences, presumably to get lower interest rates. Her Atlanta mortgage was “higher than prevailing market rates at the time,” the Journal said. “This should be case closed on the Cook mortgage issue,” Georgetown Law professor Adam Levitin told The New York Times. “There is no way to maintain a criminal prosecution in light of the disclosure in Cook’s loan application.”\n\nTrump’s lawyers asked the appellate court to lift the lower court’s pause on removing Cook by this evening, before the two-day Fed policy meeting kicks off tomorrow. The ruling, and an expected Senate vote today to confirm White House economic adviser Stephen Miran to fill a Fed vacancy, “likely won’t change the outcome of the meeting,” which is expected to end with a quarter-point rate cut, Reuters said.\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

That’s a full 20-point gender gap. \n\nAnd among voters aged 18-29, the divide was even sharper: Trump eked out a 1-point win with young men, 49-48, while Harris crushed with young women by 23 points, 61-38. That’s a 22-point gulf.\n\nThis widening gap is more than just a number; it reflects the rise of the manosphere and the hard-right—and often fascist—turn by many young men. I’ve written about it here, here, and here. It is one of the fundamental political challenges facing the left, and the trend line isn’t improving.\n\nA recent NBC News Decision Desk poll underscores the cultural roots of this split. \n\nFor young men, 34% said that having children is important to their personal definition of success, with another 29% saying that of being married. For young women, the number was just 6% for each. \n\nBoth men and women highly value financial independence and a fulfilling career, but women—with higher educational attainment—are increasingly competing for and winning those opportunities. That leaves a generation of men who want families and children—while their female peers don’t—struggling to secure careers in increasingly competitive fields.\n\nEnter the manosphere and its influencers—a sprawling network of podcasts, YouTube channels, and social media accounts feeding young men a steady diet of grievance. The core message is always the same: Men are owed women—women to bear their children, keep their homes, and provide sex. \n\nIf they don’t get it, someone else is to blame. Feminism, liberalism, and “woke culture” are cast as corrupting forces that have tricked women into abandoning their supposed biological destinies. It’s a worldview that tells men that they’re victims, denied what is rightfully theirs.\n\nThat resentment finds fertile ground in the cultural divide we see in polling. One-third of young men say that marriage and children are central to their idea of success, while only a tiny fraction of young women agree. Men are setting expectations that their peers don’t share, then running headlong into disappointment when reality doesn’t match the script. \n\nThe manosphere thrives on that dissonance, telling frustrated young men that the problem isn’t them—it’s women who have been “brainwashed” to pursue independence and careers instead of family.\n\nThe most prominent figures package this poison in different ways. Andrew Tate flaunts wealth and hyper-masculinity, telling young men that dominance over women is proof of success. Nick Fuentes and his followers—dubbed “Groypers”—wrap their misogyny in white nationalism and “traditional values,” railing against women’s independence as a symptom of Western decline. \n\nOthers in the ecosystem dress up their message as self-improvement advice, but the pivot is always the same: True masculinity means reasserting rigid gender hierarchies—by any force necessary.\n\nIt’s toxic and dangerous. These ideas don’t just encourage resentment; they legitimize violence. When men are told that society has “stolen” their futures, it doesn’t take much for frustration to turn into radicalization. \n\nWe might even find that Charlie Kirk’s assassin was influenced by these circles, particularly the Groypers, who have feuded with Kirk for years in what they call the “Groyper War.” The difference between the two alt-right groups? To the Groypers, MAGA conservatives aren’t Nazi enough. \n\nThat kind of alienation and nihilism isn’t just a threat to the left. Disaffected young men could just as easily turn their anger against Republicans if they feel betrayed or ignored. Radicalized young men are combustible—history shows that societies that fail to channel their energy constructively often end up facing violence, extremism, or even authoritarian movements built on their resentment. \n\nAnd we’re already seeing the warning signs in online threats, mass shootings, and the growing overlap between misogynist and extremist communities. The stakes aren’t just electoral—they’re societal.\n\nI don’t write this to mock or dismiss. Their concerns may strike us as absurd, but to them, they’re real. Ignoring this problem only puts us at risk of making it worse.\n\nSolutions are tough, but we do have them.","summary":"The gender gap is a political chasm. \n\n\n\nIn the 2024 election, President Donald Trump won men by 12 points, 55-43, while Democratic nominee Kamala Harris won women by 8 points, 53-45.

Dave Min was the lone Democrat who sided with Republicans on several proposals that would exert greater federal control over Washington. \n\nHeld in the final hours of President Donald Trump’s 30-day takeover of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Department, GOP members advanced a series of bills aimed at codifying changes to policing, sentencing and self-governance in D.C. — a push that critics have viewed as an existential threat to home rule. \n\nMin crossed party lines to support several measures, including one that would lower the age that minors could be tried as adults for certain offenses, legislation that would increase mandatory minimum sentences for violent crimes, and a bill that would repeal a D.C. law that implemented changes to local policing practices that Republicans have frequently criticized.\n\nGetting to Congress: With a law degree from Harvard, Min began his career as a staff attorney for the Securities and Exchange Commission. He spent two years at the agency, followed by three years at the law firm WilmerHale before landing on Capitol Hill. Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., hired Min in 2007 as an economic and financial policy adviser on the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. \n\nNext Min moved to the Joint Economic Committee to serve as banking counsel, where Schumer was chairman. In 2009 he joined liberal policy group Center for American Progress, where he rose to become associate director of financial markets. He left CAP to teach at the University of California at Irvine’s law school. \n\nAfter an unsuccessful 2018 bid for Congress, Min was elected to the California Senate two years later. In 2024 he ran for the open House seat vacated by former Rep. Katie Porter. Min defeated Republican Scott Baugh in November with 51 percent of the vote.\n\nHis District: California’s 47th District covers coastal Orange County, including the city of Irvine, home to the University of California at Irvine, a major research institution and employer. The district is wealthy, with an overall median household income of over $123,229 in 2023, significantly higher than the national median household income of $80,610. In upscale communities such as Newport Beach, that figure climbs to nearly $160,000. \n\nDemographically, the district is home to a large Asian population, making up nearly a quarter of the overall population.

This includes data for Chicago — even as ICE ramped up at various points over the past few months and the president announced his so-called Operation Midway Blitz.\n\nCollective action: The Deportation Data Project is a collective of lawyers and academics who work to extend ICE’s data, including information about arrests and detentions in ICE custody. The collective won a lawsuit forcing the government to release these numbers under the Freedom of Information Act. Their data, covering the entire country, currently goes through July.\n\nThe reveals: ICE arrested 537 more people — a 59% rise — in Illinois in 2025 than in 2024 between mid-January and the end of July. And the number of those detained went through the roof: ICE detained 3,182 more people at its Broadview processing center or in downtown Chicago — a 185% increase — this year than in 2024.\n\nJim Edgar, former Illinois governor, dies at 79\n\nReporting by Selena Kuznikov\n\nEx-governor dies: Former Illinois Republican Gov. Jim Edgar, who also served as Illinois Secretary of State and as a state representative, died Sunday. Edgar was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January and had been hospitalized at the time of his death due to a reaction to cancer treatment. He was 79.\n\nPolitical past: Mr. Edgar was a moderate Republican whose ranks have all but disappeared in Illinois politics as the Trump-era MAGA movement took hold in the state. He was pro-choice on abortion and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in her 2024 presidential bid against Donald Trump.\n\n‘Good public servant’: In a July interview with Sun-Times reporter Fran Spielman, Mr. Edgar spoke about his legacy. He said: “I want people to think, ‘He was a good, good public servant, he did a good job. Didn’t always agree with him, but he tried to do what he thought was the right thing.’”\n\nEx-Ald.

Walter Burnett — Mayor Brandon Johnson’s pick to run the Chicago Housing Authority — and his wife, Darlena Williams-Burnett, have been paid more than $260,000 as housing voucher landlords for the agency since 2007, records show.\n\nConflict of interest?: The Burnetts have had 10 contracts for properties rented to CHA voucher holders, including two ongoing contracts and five that were active while Williams-Burnett worked for the city agency. The voucher payments to Burnett and his wife appear to present conflicts of interest, which could be a roadblock to Burnett’s appointment to lead the CHA.\n\nKey context: The vouchers are offered through the Housing Choice Voucher Program, widely known as Section 8, the nation’s primary subsidized housing initiative. Under the program, public housing agencies provide subsidies to help low-income residents pay for privately owned housing.\n\nMORE NEWS YOU NEED\n\nAnti-immigrant message: A dead rat and a threatening note were left outside 40th Ward Ald.

Agents allege González struck an officer with his car while attempting to flee a traffic stop, though that hasn’t been independently confirmed. Also Friday, Willian Gimenez, a day laborer who filed a lawsuit accusing off-duty police officers of ethnically motivated assault, was taken into custody less than a mile from where the parade kicked off, leaving many uneasy Sunday.\n\nMuted celebrations: Paradegoers told the Sun-Times that Sunday’s parade saw fewer participants than in years past, part of the weekend’s trend of muted Mexican Independence Day celebrations.

He described his strategy as “boring,” mentioning private equity firms, mutual funds, and indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) as his team’s primary focus.\n\nThe activist occasionally took bigger risks, however. In the same episode, he reflected on the “tariff stuff” and the COVID-19 pandemic, saying he “went all in” on triple-leveraged NASDAQ exchange-traded funds (ETFs), calling it the easiest bet of his life: \n\n“I went all in and bought the dip during the tariff stuff and COVID. During COVID I bought triple-leveraged QQQ. It was the easiest bet I’ve ever made in my life. My whole premise at the time was: this is so self-inflicted. We decided to shut down the country. A meteor didn’t strike. It’s not an alien invasion. We could reverse this immediately,” said Kirk, revealing his optimism for the nation’s economic future at the time.\n\nCharlie Kirk’s crypto rhetoric\n\nKirk’s political philosophy was closely tied to his economic outlook. Turning Point USA, his non-profit organization founded in 2021, claims on the official website that its mission is “to promote the principles of fiscal responsibility, free markets, and limited government,” all values that shaped his enthusiasm for cryptocurrency.\n\nUnsurprisingly, then, Kirk praised Trump’s pro-crypto campaign leading up to the 2024 presidential election, drawing a sharp contrast with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ skepticism.\n\nIndeed, even during the late 2024 bear market, Trump’s advisor described Bitcoin as possessing greater “integrity” than the U.S. dollar, noting in particular its fixed supply and transparent blockchain ledger.\n\nEarlier this year, he even called cryptocurrency a possible solution to national debt:\n\n“The United States should have a strategic Bitcoin reserve… There is something called the mass adoption theory, which is: over a period of time—like the English language, the U.S. dollar—things just catch on, and they’re kind of volitional, and there’s no stopping it. I think Bitcoin is that… If we start a strategic Bitcoin reserve it could, like, pay for the national debt and, like, cover our losses on the deficit.”\n\nKirk’s other investments\n\nKirk’s exact holdings prior to death were not disclosed, but it is known that he was one of the early investors in 1789 Capital, an American venture capital firm promoting products and companies associated with conservative values, most notably MAGA-related businesses.\n\nA large portion of his wealth also came from real estate. The Chicago activist owned multiple properties, most notably a Spanish-style mansion in Scottsdale, Arizona, which was reportedly sold for $6.5 million in early 2025. \n\nHis other properties included an oceanfront condo in Florida valued around $855,000 and a high-profile apartment in Phoenix of undisclosed value.\n\nAll in all, it appears that Kirk and his team were committed to diversification, focusing on conservative, steady-growth investments such as index funds and real estate while also promoting bolder, more high-risk bets and alternative assets like cryptocurrency.\n\nFeatured image via Shutterstock","summary":"The late Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA and a close ally of President Donald Trump, was widely known &#8230; Continue reading\n\n\nThe post Inside Charlie Kirk’s investment portfolio appeared first on Finbold.","url":"https://finbold.com/inside-charlie-kirks-investment-portfolio/","image":"https://assets.finbold.com/uploads/2025/09/Inside-Charlie-Kirks-investment-portfolio.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 12:58:46","author":"Marko Marjanovic","authors":["Marko Marjanovic"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":360659008,"title":"Donald Trump Left No Chance to Throw Shade at Stephen Colbert – But Guess Who’s Having the Last Laugh","text":"We bet that a certain television set at the White House, Washington D.C., won’t likely be tuning into the Emmys 2025 tonight, where Stephen Colbert bagged a humongous standing ovation bang on the minute he stepped on-stage to present the awards. However, his words of humility did not miss out on taking a jibe at Trump, who actually had a major hand behind Colbert’s prime time show being canceled out of nowhere.\n\nIn a viral video shared on X by the official handle of New York Magazine, Colbert can be heard saying, “Thank you very much. You’re very kind. Sit down. We gotta go. But while I have your attention, is anyone hiring?” Soon after, he actually pulled out his resume and added on, “I just — I haven’t had a chance to update my headshot in a bit, but I think it still works. I only have one [copy]. Harrison Ford, can you get this to Spielberg? Would you?”\n\n“Is anyone hiring?” – Stephen Colbert at the #Emmys after getting a raucous standing ovation. pic.twitter.com/NezyqyOzuS\n— New York Magazine (@NYMag) September 15, 2025\n\nFor those of you landing onto the context of the matter, do join us as we rewind in time just by a few days when CBS announced the cancellation of their show The Late Show, which Colbert himself hosted. In their statement, the channel network, which Paramount Global owns, had clarified that their decision was purely driven by ‘financial moves’ and was not closely linked to any other reason.\n\nHowever, curious viewers and whistleblowers were quick to dissect how the decision had a direct link with Paramount’s whopping $16 million settlement with none other than Donald Trump for a 60-minute-long interview of former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nAs for Colbert, he did not waste a beat in commenting on the rapid decision to cancel his show, and definitely criticized it as the ‘big fat bribe’ case during his show in July. He had said, “As someone who has always been a proud employee of this network, I am offended. I don’t know if anything will ever repair my trust in this company. But, just taking a stab at it, I’d say $16 million would help.”\n\nThat’s certainly not the end of the matter. The debate escalated further when Donald Trump gloated over Stephen Colbert getting fired from the show. According to The Hollywood Reporter, he dropped a note on his Truth Social Platform on the same day. He even extended his direct attack on Jimmy Kimmel and his other nemesis, Jimmy Fallon.\n\nHe had written, “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings. I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next. Has even less talent than Colbert! Greg Gutfeld is better than all of them combined, including the Moron on NBC who ruined the once great Tonight Show.”\n\nInterestingly, Stephen, too, wasn’t in any mood to take up the jibe at any cost. During a July 2025 episode of The Late Show, he finally made a direct reply to Donald Trump, adding how the latter was ‘not a good fit’ to run as the President. \n\nStephen Colbert’s Emmys speech was so good\n“I have never loved my country more desperately. Stay strong, be brave, and if the elevator tries to bring you down, go crazy and punch a higher floor!” pic.twitter.com/uYTTCXZhS2\n— Spencer Althouse (@SpencerAlthouse) September 15, 2025 \n\nColbert even clapped back at the nasty remark by Trump on his show and, without a blink, said, “How dare you, sir? Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism?” and then finally addressed the U.S. President directly on camera with the words, “go f— yourself.”","summary":"Trump's enemy gets honored at Emmy's, what's in store at White House tonight?","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/donald-trump-left-no-chance-to-throw-shade-at-stephen-colbert-but-guess-whos-having-the-last-laugh","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/cover-7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 12:58:22","author":"Srijony Das","authors":["Srijony Das"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":360658922,"title":"Kamala Harris book excerpts show Democrats still clueless on border security","text":"That said, Harris is still a Democrat in good standing, and while she may not be the party’s future leader, her approach to issues reflects how the party broadly engages with them.\n\nIn her new book, 107 Days, Harris frames her role in immigration policy as part of a broader narrative that attributes her election loss to former President Joe Biden and his team rather than herself.\n\nTo be fair, Harris correctly points out that she was never made “border czar” as many have claimed. She was instead tasked with a much smaller portfolio of addressing the “root causes” of migration in the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador. Harris claims she was right for the task since she had “ideas about the kinds of investments and other interventions that over time would reduce irregular migration, help to bring stability, and offer people a safer future in their own community.”\n\n“Most people don’t want to leave home,” Harris writes, echoing a phrase Biden often repeated when talking about border security. “And when they do [leave], it is usually for one of two reasons: they fear for their lives, or they can’t make a living,” Harris continues. “Much of that region is rural, and farmers are increasingly hit by climate events such as floods and droughts. If you can no longer grow food where you are, and if there’s no other livelihood, you will leave, because there’s simply no choice. Corruption and gangs thrive when there are limited resources.”\n\nThis was not just Harris’s view of the border crisis. This is exactly what Biden said, and it is what all of the major left-of-center think tanks said as well. If we could just get the economies of Central America on track and reduce crime and corruption, migrants would stop coming from these countries.\n\nTo this end, Harris claims she secured “$5.2 billion in new investments by private companies for the region” and “held numerous bilateral meetings with leaders throughout the region,” including then-Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei and then-Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. \n\n“In the locations where I was able to bring new enterprises and greater stability,” Harris claims, “data showed it was working. Our investments had created 70,000 new jobs, reached more than a million people with training programs, and connected 2.5 million previously unbanked people with banking services and access to credit. These people were staying put.”\n\nTurning back to the purpose of her story, Harris then takes a dig at Biden: “I wanted to get that good news out. But White House staff stalled. ‘Not yet. We need more data.’ The story remained untold.”\n\nApparently, she wants us to believe that if only the Biden White House had put out more press releases celebrating the investments Harris “secured” in Central America, then voters would have ignored all the deprivation and chaos Biden’s border crisis had created in their communities.\n\nBut does the “data” show that all the private sector commitments “secured” by Harris stopped the flow of migrants from Central America? Not at all.\n\nHarris first announced $1.2 billion in investments for Central America in December 2021, followed by another $3 billion by February 2023 for a total of $4.2 billion, including a $300 million investment from Target. Meanwhile, while all this Harris-directed investment was pouring into Central America, migration out was still rising. When Harris was first tasked with addressing the “root causes of migration from Central America” in May 2021, just 22,630 migrants from those countries were caught illegally crossing the southern border. By June 2022, that number had risen to 57,948, and by August 2023, it had ballooned to 79,185.\n\nNow it is true that illegal immigration did start falling during the Biden administration before Trump was sworn into office for his second term. But again, the reason Biden and Harris both claim illegal immigration fell is complete fiction. Biden, Harris, and the Democratic Party want everyone to believe that immigration started falling in June 2024, after Biden issued an executive order requiring migrants affirmatively to claim fear of being returned to their home country, instead of Border Patrol agents just assuming everyone who was arrested wanted to claim asylum.\n\nAnd illegal border crossings from all countries did fall from 130,415 in June 2024 to 96,308 in the last month of Biden’s presidency — since Trump took office, they have fallen to a historic low of 7,832, a subject we will return to later. But the decline in border crossings during the Biden presidency did not start in June. It started six months earlier, in December 2023, when a record high of 301,981 illegal immigrants were encountered at the southern border. \n\nSo, what happened in December 2023 that suddenly turned illegal immigration around? Maybe that $300 million check Harris got from Target finally cleared? No. What happened was that then-Secretary of State Antony Blinken and then-Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, not Harris, met with Obrador in Mexico and made a secret deal.\n\nObrador agreed to have Mexican law enforcement officials begin detaining migrants in cities close to the U.S. border, forcing them onto buses, and then sending those buses far south back into Mexico. In exchange, Biden would support Obrador’s chosen successor, Claudia Sheinbaum, and would not announce his new executive order on immigration until after Sheinbaum had been safely elected, which is exactly what happened.\n\nMexican police began rounding up migrants, putting them on buses, which then rolled into towns like Villahermosa, which is 1,000 miles away from the U.S.-Mexico border. As a direct result of these enforcement policies, illegal border crossings plummeted. \n\n“I shouldered the blame for the porous border,” Harris whines in her book, “an issue that had proved intractable for Democratic and Republican administrations alike. … It was an issue that absolutely demanded bipartisan cooperation at an impossibly partisan, most uncooperative time.”\n\nExcept that Trump’s second term in office has exposed this argument to be completely false as well. The border is not an “intractable” issue. It did not require “bipartisan cooperation.” Trump solved it by himself. As mentioned above, when Trump first came into office, almost 100,000 illegal immigrants were crossing the border every month. That number has since fallen to just 7,832. With numbers that low, the federal government no longer has to release migrants into the United States due to limited detention capacity. Since May 2025, zero illegal immigrants have been released into the U.S., a number not achieved in over a decade.\n\nTrump solved the border crisis. Completely. Without any new laws and without any help from Congress. All he had to do was enforce existing immigration law (and maybe use tariffs as leverage to force Mexico to take more migrants back).\n\nNow, Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed without any Democratic support this July, does help provide resources for future immigration enforcement, including $45 billion for new detention facilities and $10 billion to hire 10,000 new Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel. These investments will make it easier for Trump to continue keeping the border secure. But the fact remains that he was able to secure the border without these resources months before they were allocated by statute.\n\nIn a sense, all this is water under the bridge. Biden, Harris, and the Democratic Party were epically wrong about the cause of and solution to the border crisis Biden created. But the past does matter. Democrats are going to run a presidential campaign again in 2028. They are going to claim they have learned from Biden’s immigration failures. Harris’s book shows they have made no progress.\n\nWhen 2027 rolls around and Democrats start running for president, they must be pressed on their immigration views: Will you dismantle Trump’s ICE policies? Will you apply the necessary pressure to Mexico to keep the border secure? Do you have the political will necessary to turn migrants away at the southern border, even if they say the word “asylum”? \n\nBiden oversaw a historic wave of illegal immigration that caused tremendous strain on communities across the country. Voters everywhere learned that when the border isn’t secure, every community is a border community. Unless voters want that tragedy to unfold again, the next Democratic presidential candidate must show he or she understands what is necessary to secure the southern border.","summary":"In Focus delivers deeper coverage of the political, cultural, and ideological issues shaping America.

But here it is, for the record: nobody in America should die for their politics.\n\nThat said, in the wake of Charlie Kirk’s assassination — the guy who downplayed slavery, demonized Black and brown people, promoted the racist antisemitic Great Replacement Theory, attacked queer people, made degrading comments about women, said gun deaths were fine because that’s the price we must pay for the Second Amendment — the media is afraid to say anything about the state of our politics other than “we need to stop violence-provoking political rhetoric on both sides.”\n\nAs if there were two sides here.\n\nHere’s the hard truth that the bullshit-embracing “both sides” punditry won’t say out loud: calling for Democrats to “tone it down” has become a permission slip for Republicans to keep stoking hate, flirting with violence, and treating fellow Americans as enemies rather than opponents.\n\nIf you actually look at the political science and the public record, the escalation didn’t start with Democrats, and it doesn’t continue because Democrats use accurate words to describe what we’re facing. The political research is clear.\n\nAs Rachel Bitecofer points out, Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein said the quiet part our loud when they wrote that the modern GOP had become “ideologically extreme, scornful of compromise, and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition” in their 2012 Washington Post essay and book-length work on asymmetric polarization.\n\nAnd this isn’t new: the rhetoric that got us here wasn’t even invented on social media. Lee Atwater explained Nixon’s Southern Strategy out loud in 1981, describing how race-baiting messages were laundered into “abstract” appeals that produced the same results without resorting to the N-word.\n\nRonald Reagan elevated the “welfare queen” trope into a national morality play that exploited poverty and race for partisan gain. The Willie Horton ad and “Revolving Door” spot baked fear-first politics into a Republican presidential campaign’s core strategy.\n\nPat Buchanan then said the quiet part with a bullhorn in his 1992 convention speech, declaring a “culture war” against Democrats and anyone who didn’t fit his vision of a Christian white America. Newt Gingrich operationalized it with his GOPAC training memo, a how-to guide that told Republican candidates to brand Democrats with words like “corrupt,” “sick,” and “traitors” while reserving terms like “freedom” and “strength” for themselves.\n\nThis wasn’t an internet rumor, it was the Republican party’s official training literature.\n\nWhen the National Rifle Association mailed a fundraising letter in 1995 calling federal agents “jack-booted thugs,” former President George H. W. Bush resigned from their board in protest, which tells you how far the mainstream right still had to travel to normalize incendiary attacks on law enforcement when it suited their politics.\n\nFast forward to the past decade and the escalation didn’t slow.\n\nRepublicans have long normalized calling Democrats “socialists” or “communists” as a baseline insult rather than an argument. This isn’t a fringe habit, it’s a standard applause line for Republican leaders and conservative media outlets.\n\nThe “Second Amendment” wink-and-nod-endorsing-violence politics isn’t new either. Sharron Angle campaigned on “Second Amendment remedies” in 2010 and Donald Trump suggested in 2016 that the “Second Amendment people” might have to step up to stop Hillary Clinton.\n\nWith Trump’s 2016 campaign, the glorification of violence moved from innuendo to stagecraft. He urged rallygoers to “knock the crap out of” protesters, then later told police “please don’t be too nice” to suspects during a Long Island speech.\n\nArmed rightwing extremists swarmed the Michigan Capitol in April 2020, a preview of how “we the people” could be recast as a threat display when public health or election results didn’t go the way Republicans wanted.\n\nRepublican Congressman Paul Gosar posted an anime video that depicted violence against AOC and President Joe Biden, which isn’t normal in an advanced democracy. Nonetheless, all but two Republicans refused to vote for his censure.\n\nThe GOP’s information pipeline supercharged moral panics about identity and belonging; the old birther lie about Barack Obama’s citizenship migrated from fringe to Fox to Trump’s core brand.\n\nThen the “Great Replacement” narrative went from white supremacist fever dream to a standard talking point on the country’s most-watched rightwing channel, and then into the manifestos of mass murderers in El Paso and Buffalo, and into the antisemitic rantings of the Tree of Life shooter who blamed Jews for “bringing invaders” here.\n\nAfter Florida’s Parental Rights in Education law, the “groomer” slur against queer people exploded by more than 400 percent because political entrepreneurs like Kirk realized how quickly a smear can mobilize fear and clicks in the current media economy.\n\nRepublican officials and aligned media also popularized the false frame that gender-affirming care equals “genital mutilation,” a homophobic slur Kirk kept using that’s been rejected on the record by federal judges examining the facts in these cases.\n\nThis is the ecosystem that produced a presidential debate moment in which Trump told the racist Proud Boys to “stand back and stand by,” and a January 6 rally where he urged supporters to “fight like hell.” The Republican National Committee later tried to rebrand the attack as “legitimate political discourse,” which was an explicit signal to their base that political violence is just fine with the GOP.\n\nThe Department of Justice charged more than 1,500 people in connection with the attack on the Capitol, including hundreds for assaulting police officers (three of whom died): Trump then pardoned them all, explaining again by his action (and the failure of any Republicans to condemn it) that political violence is just fine with today’s GOP.\n\nRuby Freeman and Shaye Moss, two election workers falsely smeared by Trump’s lawyer, won a landmark defamation verdict because Republican threats to public servants are real, not rhetorical flourishes.\n\nWhen critics talk about authoritarian drift, they aren’t making it up for cable hits. Trump created “Schedule F” by executive order in 2020 to strip job protections from large categories of civil servants. President Biden revoked it but now it’s back, leading to a dangerous politicization of the federal bureaucracy that’s now hunting and purging “lefties” the way slave patrolers once tracked down escapees.\n\nAlongside that, Trump has publicly urged defunding or punishing the FBI and DOJ when they investigate him, and even floated “terminating” parts of the Constitution, which is rhetoric that would have ended careers a generation ago and now earns a shrug from most of his party’s elected officials.\n\nAnd, as Jessica Valenti points out:\n\n“[W]hen a pregnant woman dies of sepsis in a hospital that could have helped her but is legally prevented from doing so, that’s political violence. It’s political violence when a child is shot in their classroom because lawmakers refuse to take action on guns. An abortion provider being assassinated after years of conservatives calling them ‘baby-killers’ is political violence, as is the death of a person who had their medical claim denied by companies more interested in their bottom line than people’s lives.”\n\nAnd now, in the wake of Kirk’s murder, Republicans are again amping up the violent rhetoric. \n\nLaura Loomer posted, “More people will be murdered if the Left isn’t crushed with the power of the state.” Trump referenced “radical left political violence” as if that’s the only source of it. Sean Davis, the CEO of The Federalist, wrote: “When Democrats lose elections they couldn’t steal, they murder the people they were unable to defeat.” Fox host Jesse Waters said, “Whether we want to accept it or not, they are at war with us.”\n\nMother Jones compiled a more comprehensive list of Republican calls for violence against Democrats.\n\nTrump made jokes about Paul Pelosi’s near-murder, and laughed when a thuggish congressional candidate assaulted a reporter for asking him a question about health care policy. That thug is now governor of Montana.\n\nAnd let’s not forget Charlie Kirk’s hero, Kyle Rittenhouse, who murdered two people and blew most of the arm off a third. Trump invited him to Mar-a-Largo to congratulate him.\n\nViolence is their brand.\n\nAnd in the wake of all this, Trump pulls the Secret Service security detail from Kamala Harris just as she begins her book tour.\n\nNow put that record next to what Democrats have done.\n\nI realize it makes them sound like wimps, but instead of vilifying their opposition Democrats in Congress have been working across the aisle for the average person, passing healthcare legislation, trying to strengthen voting rights, reduce student debt, clean up the environment, rebuild our infrastructure and kick-start chip manufacturing, and hold corporate criminals to account.\n\nAfter Democratic Minnesota House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband were murdered by a rightwinger with a list of almost 50 other Democrats he planned to kill, and a state senator and his wife were wounded, Trump refused to even call Governor Tim Walz, much less lower flags to half-staff. Democrats, who’d lost a genuine hero, universally called for toning down political rhetoric instead of vengeance or retributive violence.\n\nWhile the GOP’s brand is “We’re victims!!!,” Democrats are more interested in getting things done for the people. And when they do call out the authoritarianism of this administration, they’re pointing to actual policies like masked secret police, military in the streets, Trump grifting billions in crypto, using the FBI to go after his political opponents, and Republicans on the Supreme Court giving Trump immunity from prosecution for actual crimes.\n\nOn top of passing legislation, Democratic leaders have consistently condemned political violence without caveat, from Biden’s 2020 speech spelling out that “rioting is not protesting” to repeated condemnations after attacks on public officials and public servants.\n\nSo when commentators ask both parties to “lower the temperature,” we should be honest about what that means in practice.\n\nToo often, it’s a request for Democrats to stop calling out the very real way the modern right has mainstreamed eliminationist rhetoric, moral-panic politics, and procedural hardball.\n\nIt is a call to pretend that saying “you’re child-abusing communists who hate America” versus “you’re undermining democracy and endangering people with lies” are mirror images.\n\nThey are not.\n\nOne is a smear that licenses political violence. The other is a description of a documented pattern of behavior with decades of receipts.\n\nNone of that means Democrats are perfect. It means Democrats are operating inside the reality-based world where deals must be made, bills must be passed, and violence is condemned when it appears on your own side.\n\nFormer Republican George Conway warns that the GOP is on the verge of turning Kirk into Horst Wessel, the Nazi streetfighter who Hitler made into a martyr when he was killed. Conway posted:\n\n“They may not want to hear it, and it may incense them, but the parallels between what the Nazis did then, and what Trump and MAGA are doing today, are striking, chilling — and as any expert on authoritarianism will tell you, straight out of the same toxic, but dog-eared, playbook.”\n\nJim Stewartson suggests Kirk’s killing could be used by Trump the way Hitler used the Reichstag Fire to change German law and give himself unlimited power.\n\nThese are indeed very, very dangerous times. And the political rhetoric coming out of 1500 rightwing hate-radio stations, Republican politicians, and billionaire-funded hard-right-biased-social-media-algorithms is at the center of the crisis.\n\nIf Republicans want the volume to come down, the path is simple.\n\nStop labeling mainstream opponents as “communists” and “groomers.”\n\nStop flirting with “Second Amendment remedies.”\n\nStop normalizing threats against election workers.\n\nStop trying to bend the machinery of government to punish critics and shield allies.\n\nWhen that happens, Democrats will meet them in the middle, because Democrats already live there when they write bipartisan infrastructure bills, subsidize domestic chip manufacturing, narrow gun loopholes, and harden the legal process for counting electoral votes.\n\nUntil then, asking Democrats to “watch their tone” is not a plan for peace: it’s a plan for unilateral disarmament in a fight the other side first chose.\n\nOur media must call the problem what it is, or we’ll never fix it. The people who lit this fire keep tossing gasoline on it. The only way to put it out is to stop pretending the arsonists and the firefighters are the same.","summary":"As a guy who regularly gets death threats because of my media presence, I shouldn’t have to say that killing people — or even threatening them — for their politics is wrong.

The political research is clear.\n\nAs Rachel Bitecofer points out, Thomas Mann and Norm Ornstein said the quiet part our loud when they wrote that the modern GOP had become “ideologically extreme, scornful of compromise, and dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition” in their 2012 Washington Post essay and book-length work on asymmetric polarization.\n\nAnd this isn’t new: the rhetoric that got us here wasn’t even invented on social media. Lee Atwater explained Nixon’s Southern Strategy out loud in 1981, describing how race-baiting messages were laundered into “abstract” appeals that produced the same results without resorting to the N-word.\n\nRonald Reagan elevated the “welfare queen” trope into a national morality play that exploited poverty and race for partisan gain. The Willie Horton ad and “Revolving Door” spot baked fear-first politics into a Republican presidential campaign’s core strategy.\n\nPat Buchanan then said the quiet part with a bullhorn in his 1992 convention speech, declaring a “culture war” against Democrats and anyone who didn’t fit his vision of a Christian white America. Newt Gingrich operationalized it with his GOPAC training memo, a how-to guide that told Republican candidates to brand Democrats with words like “corrupt,” “sick,” and “traitors” while reserving terms like “freedom” and “strength” for themselves.\n\nThis wasn’t an internet rumor, it was the Republican party’s official training literature.\n\nWhen the National Rifle Association mailed a fundraising letter in 1995 calling federal agents “jack-booted thugs,” former President George H.

It’s a brand-new program. We think you qualify,’” Sintery said. But it seemed too good to be true.\n\nThe program promised $1,500 for all expectant mothers during pregnancy and $500 per month for the first year of their infant’s life. All Sintery had to do was upload a copy of her ultrasound and ID. Pregnant with her second child 19 years after she’d had her first, Sintery needed all new baby supplies. And as a preschool teacher, she’d be grateful for any help she could get paying for all of it.\n\nIt wasn’t too good to be true. Researchers at Michigan State University had just launched the United States’s first community-wide, unconditional cash transfer program for new families, and Sintery – who gave birth to her daughter Jolene Love in May 2024 – qualified.\n\n“It took so much stress away,” said Sintery. “I used that money to buy my car seat, to buy her bassinet and her crib.” She was also able to take the first 14 weeks of her daughter’s life off from work, and afford diapers and wipes in the months to come. The extra money helped Sintery “step back and enjoy my pregnancy”.\n\nThis week, researchers at Michigan State University published two studies formalizing what Sintery felt. Their results showed that Rx Kids lowered rates of maternal postpartum depression, stabilized families’ housing and improved infant outcomes – saving millions of dollars in NICU spending.\n\nThe town of Flint made headlines a decade ago when pediatrician Mona Hanna discovered lead levels in local children’s blood had risen dangerously after the city switched its water supply to the Flint River. The coalition that came together to protect children then continued to advocate for children after the water crisis resolved, Hanna said.\n\n“Rx Kids was born out of the same spirit that a community came together and said: ‘We’re not OK with poisoned water’” and later would say “we’re not OK with our babies being born into poverty”, she said.\n\nBut it wasn’t until Congress implemented the expanded child tax credit in 2021, to support families during the Covid-19 pandemic, that Hanna said she realized the United States could do something nearly 70% of countries worldwide already do: give money to parents of young children.\n\n“As a pediatrician, I have wanted for decades to be able to prescribe away poverty,” she added. “Poverty is a pathogen. It makes kids sick.”\n\nThe expanded child tax credit cut child poverty in the United States in half. But when Congress chose not to renew it, Hanna said she and her fellow researchers felt an urgent need to “keep this work in the public imagination”.\n\nNow director of the Michigan State University-Hurley Children’s Hospital Pediatric Public Health Initiative, Hanna and her colleague Luke Shaefer, a professor of social justice and social policy at the University of Michigan and director of the university’s Poverty Solutions program, decided they wanted to try something that actually would prescribe away poverty.\n\nThey founded Rx Kids, with the support of the non-profit GiveDirectly, a US-based group focused on ending extreme poverty through unconditional cash transfers. In the 1o years that it’s been active, GiveDirectly has delivered $900m to families in 15 countries, such as Bangladesh, Liberia, Rwanda and Uganda.\n\n“The need for these types of programs is a testament to the fact that we’re not as ahead as we think we are, especially relative to our wealthy, peer nations,” said Laura Keen, the group’s US program director. She cites the fact that the United States is one of few countries in the world without a universal child benefit and the country’s high child poverty rate relative to peer nations. The US is also one of only seven countries in the world without a paid maternity leave policy. In Flint, she notes, three in five children live in poverty.\n\nOther cities and counties have piloted similar cash transfer programs in the United States, but Rx Kids is believed to be the first universal, community-wide cash transfer program in the country. Rather than prescribing cash transfers for low-income residents only, the Flint program is open to every pregnant resident. And because the sign-up process is streamlined, and well-advertised, 100% of eligible residents in Flint sign up for it. That take-up rate is notable compared with other child welfare programs, such as Wic, where only about 50% of those eligible sign up for the benefit.\n\n“This is a place-based intervention. This is not for poor people. It’s for poor places,” said Hanna. That approach reduces shame and stigma, and tells residents “we trust you, we know how hard it is to have a kid and there’s a whole village, society, walking alongside you and investing in you”, she said.\n\nThe approach also has helped Rx Kids rebuild trust in the city’s institutions, Keen says, especially after the water crisis. Regardless of income, “pregnancy and childbirth are hard for everyone”, she said. The program aims to acknowledge that “families are poorest in this perinatal period, leading right up to birth and then following the birth of a child” but also that the same “period conversely is such a critical developmental window for the baby”.\n\nHanna adds that the universality makes the program easy to administer; even as it’s expanded to new communities, it hasn’t had to hire more staff - which has won it wide bipartisan support. The size of the program has also created a large dataset for Michigan State researchers to assess its impacts.\n\nIn one paper, published Monday in the American Journal of Public Health, Hanna and her co-authors found that no low-income families were evicted after childbirth and postpartum depression levels fell 14% among mothers who participated in Rx Kids.\n\n“In every measure of financial stability, of maternal mental health and maternal wellbeing, the mamas that were exposed to Rx Kids had improved outcomes,” said Hanna.\n\nThe perinatal period can be one of the most financially unstable times for families, as they take time off work to give birth and care for newborns but also see the rising costs of diapers, formula and childcare.\n\nIn a second, preprinted analysis published on the Social Science Research Network, Hanna and her colleagues found that those same cash transfers translated to better infant outcomes, which saved millions of state dollars. Infants whose families were enrolled in Rx Kids experienced lower rates of prematurity and low birth weight, which resulted in fewer NICU admissions, saving the city of Flint up to $6.2m a year.\n\nHanna hopes these two studies are just the first of many. Although Rx Kids began in Flint, the program has since expanded to 11 communities across Michigan, and is near to launching in six others.\n\n“What we started in Flint was never just about Flint,” said Hanna, adding it was instead proving that unconditional cash transfers could be done on a large scale in the United States.\n\n“Nothing that we’re doing is new and exciting,” she added. “This work is done around the world because nations understand that it’s for their best interest” to invest in children. “We have the most expensive healthcare system in the world. It is a sickness-based system. It is reactive. And really we should be funding and supporting interventions like Rx Kids, which is prevention-driven.”\n\nHanna and her colleagues are hopeful that the success of the expanded child tax credit and programs like Rx Kids are creating a growing base of support for similar programs in the United States – across party lines. During the 2024 presidential campaign, both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris campaigned on promises of giving larger tax credits to families of newborns. “Caring for babies is a nonpartisan issue,” Hanna said, noting that Rx Kids has begun having conversations with lawmakers in red and blue states about replicating the program elsewhere.\n\n“People see different virtues in it that reflect their distinct viewpoints. So we have senators that make a pro-life case advocating for Rx Kids. We have others that make a libertarian case advocating for it,” said Keen. “Our goal is to expand to a red state to show that this isn’t predicated on certain political conditions.”\n\nToday, Sintery’s daughter Jolene is 16 months old and attending daycare at the same preschool where Sintery works. She says Jolene is outgoing, talkative and curious – and that as her mom, she’s “having a blast”.

Senack writes for multiple newspapers in the Ottawa area, including the Barrhaven Independent—a local community outlet in Nepean, where Prime Minister Mark Carney was running (and later won). Shortly after the election was called, Senack was barred from a campaign event because it was “pool coverage only”—meaning only select journalists were given access to the PM. “I said to his team that I didn’t think this was a good idea,” Senack says. He writes for residents who would be voting in his riding. “We should probably have a good relationship.”\n\nTwo hours later, the PM’s office called to apologize. “I’m, like, if you want to make it right, you’re going to have to give me an interview with Mark Carney,” he says. As the campaign dragged on, it became clear the interview wasn’t happening. Then came the call: no PM—but maybe a sit-down with Carney’s wife. \n\nAfter some back and forth came the confirmation: Fox Carney was in. “I was told this is the only interview she’ll be doing, as she doesn’t like doing them,” Senack says.\n\nBut behind that reluctance was a résumé that suggested she would have plenty to say. An alumna of the University of Oxford—where she met the future PM—Fox Carney studied philosophy, politics, and economics. She holds a master’s degree in agricultural economics from Oxford and another master’s, in international relations, from the University of Pennsylvania. She’s also widely respected as an expert on global climate and energy policy.\n\nThe interview, however brief, offered a glimpse into her own political instincts and the Carney campaign’s ground game. Acting as “his eyes and ears” in Nepean while her husband criss-crossed the country, she knocked on doors daily, calling the riding “friendly” and diverse—“it’s got every community here.” Asked about her ties to the area, a less affluent suburb than the family’s own Ottawa neighbourhood, she replied, “I’ve been in and out of Nepean for twenty years,” citing her kids’ hockey tournaments. Though new to retail politics, she came across as enthusiastic, well briefed, and strategically deployed.\n\nThe interview appeared to double as a soft launch for her public role: part surrogate, part character witness, part co-pilot. And in a race where Carney’s national profile left him somewhat distant from local concerns, her presence seemed engineered to bridge that gap. \n\nSome questions were off limits. During the campaign, stories had circulated about one of the Carney children. “I was told I couldn’t ask about the kids for that reason,” says Senack. One wonders if the recirculated 2013 photos of the Carneys at a British music festival alongside convicted sex offender Ghislaine Maxwell—the former partner of the late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein—have also had something to do with the hesitancy to grant an interview. Fox Carney’s sister and Maxwell were reported to have gone to high school together. Perhaps Fox Carney was concerned that the Maxwell association might come up. \n\nPersonal interviews can certainly be intimidating, especially if you aren’t used to them. And in a world where some first ladies can be eager performers, Fox Carney stands out. “I don’t think she likes being the centre of attention,” says Senack.\n\nWho Is Mark Carney, Really?\nJustin Trudeau Lost the Plot. Now He’s Looking for a New One\nOf Course We’re Interested in the Trudeau Split\n\nThe role of first lady can be daunting. You’re very visible, often politicized, and bound by expectations of grace and restraint while under constant scrutiny. Most wives have time to ease into it, adjusting gradually as their spouses build campaign teams and gear up for a run. That wasn’t the case for Fox Carney. Former PM Justin Trudeau didn’t leave office in disgrace, but the circumstances leading up to his resignation came about abruptly. Last December, few could have predicted that Fox Carney’s husband would be his successor come March and then take the election a month later. She was thrust into the spotlight almost overnight.\n\nEliza Reid knows how that feels. The former first lady of Iceland was thrown into her new job when her husband, Guðni Thorlacius Jóhannesson, took office as president in 2016. The Panama Papers—leaked documents exposing how the global elite hide their wealth in offshore accounts—had ensnared then prime minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson, who had failed to disclose that he and his wife owned an offshore company. The scandal led to his resignation, propelling incumbent president Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson to bow out of the election. As Jóhannesson provided calm, insightful commentary on television, the public took notice. Encouraged by the response, he ran for office—and won.\n\nReid, who was born in Ottawa and raised close to the capital city, became the first lady of a country she had adopted—just like Fox Carney. “It all happened over a period of seven weeks, so very, very suddenly,” Reid tells me from her home in a suburb outside Reykjavik.\n\nThere are a number of stresses that come with being the spouse of a world leader, says Reid. The first is superficial. Female spouses of world leaders undergo a scrutiny male counterparts bypass. “There was my clothing and image,” she says. “It’s not my forte or my interest.” Reid’s thought process was: “I want to serve well and everything, but I don’t even know how to dress.’” \n\nFox Carney, a mother of four, had to contend with the same thing. Within weeks of her husband’s election, fashion magazines contrasted her “no-nonsense” fashion sense with that of the stylish Sophie Grégoire Trudeau. But fashion, for first ladies, is never just fashion—it ends up being a form of signalling. And for political watchers, even understated choices can seem to offer insight into policy values. Fox Carney’s well-toned silhouette could be said to suggest a disciplined, pragmatic side; her clothes are more about movement than ornament. She’s fond of tennis: the Carneys have been spotted at Wimbledon in the past. But she’s also an avid hockey fan, who met her husband through the sport while both were students at Oxford. She played forward; he was a goaltender. The university’s ice hockey club once described her as someone who could “skate rings around her opponents and move effortlessly through the opposing line.” \n\nThat mix of athletic grit and quiet polish was probably honed long before Oxford: she attended Marlborough College, the same boarding school that Catherine, the princess of Wales, went to. “She’s British, but she’s not like the ‘snobby British,’” says Senack. “She didn’t give me that energy at all.”\n\nThe energy Fox Carney does radiate is that of an “eco-warrior,” a label given to her by the Telegraph—one that she picked up for her environmental expertise and long-standing activism. She was previously the vice president of Canada 2020, a self-styled “independent progressive think-tank.” She has chaired climate funds and has been on the boards of several charities, such as Save the Children. (She joined Eurasia Group—political risk forecasters for businesses, investors, and governments—as a senior adviser in 2021, working under Vice Chairman Gerald Butts, former principal secretary to Justin Trudeau.) \n\nWhatever interest Fox Carney has in fashion seems focused on pushing responsible supply chains and resisting consumerism. In 2012, she said that “having more stuff doesn’t make us happy,” adding that she has “seen first-hand the devastation that our willful refusal to challenge consumerist habits is wreaking on marginal communities.”\n\nBut advocacy comes with complications—especially for a political spouse. “If you’re choosing to be active and talking about things, you put yourself up for criticism,” says Reid, who participated on panels and gave keynote addresses. “At the same time, you’re not the one elected to a position.” The former first lady gives the example of being asked for help several times on any given issue: it could be an ask for her to push for a certain legislation or to push back against one. “It was usually something that had nothing to do with what I was doing.”\n\nPerhaps the most jarring shift for Reid was realizing she was suddenly defined by her marriage. “While I’m proud to be my husband’s wife, I don’t consider it my defining characteristic as a human being,” she says. It’s a public adjustment other political spouses know well. Last year, in our interview for her book Closer Together, Grégoire Trudeau bristled at how people projected a role onto her. “A lot of people asked me in the beginning if I was going to be okay being the wife of somebody,” she told me. “I said, ‘I’m not the wife of anybody!’”\n\nBut resisting the label doesn’t always mean escaping the expectations that come with it. In 2019, Reid wrote a New York Times piece about her own frustrations with the stereotypes foisted on first ladies—which include acting as “window dressing” for their husbands’ politics. Female spouses, as Reid put it, are expected to showcase the “lighter side of the Force.” \n\nSenack’s interview with Fox Carney is a case in point: she describes a man who devours books, chases new bands, and fumbles chores. “I’m not going to say he’s the most practical person around the house,” she quips about the technocrat now moving through Canadian politics with the cold focus of someone bent on remaking it in his image.\n\nPerhaps part of the mystery surrounding Fox Carney is in how inaccessible she seems. Selective in appearances, uninterested in the limelight, she doesn’t appear to currently have a social media presence other than her LinkedIn account. “My speculation is that she will have more of a back-feet role during her husband’s reign,” says Senack. “She prefers to stay on the sidelines.” \n\nBut there are also signs that she’s warming up to her situation. The last time Senack saw her in person was during King Charles’s official visit to Ottawa for the speech from the throne in May. “The impression I got was that she seemed very comfortable.” Similarly, Senack says, she was engaged and animated at the Canada Day event in Nepean. “I feel like she does better with smaller settings and crowds, one on one.” In her first official function as wife of the PM, Fox Carney hosted a luncheon for the spouses of G7 leaders in Alberta in June.\n\nFox Carney may be finding her footing in a space that male political spouses are almost never expected to tread. Flip the script and the expectations vanish. Hillary Clinton joked that if she became president, she’d still pick the flowers for the state dinner; pundits puzzled over what a first gentleman’s job even was; and when then vice president Kamala Harris ran against Donald Trump, a columnist mused whether her husband Doug Emhoff’s suits were likely to make the cover of Vogue.\n\nDefining yourself outside your spouse’s job feels like its own political act. Before her husband took office, Reid was an editor of Icelandair’s in-flight magazine. She had also co-founded a writer’s retreat. “It was very top of mind that I didn’t allow Eliza to disappear in that whole adventure,” she says. She also worked on a Nordic noir mystery novel, Death on the Island, which came out this past April. During her husband’s time in office, Reid also wrote a non-fiction book on Iceland’s “sprakkar”—or famous women. It was an extension of her advocacy work for gender equality.\n\nLike Reid, Grégoire Trudeau used her platform to amplify a cause she was passionate about: mental health. Laureen Harper, the wife of former PM Stephen Harper, had planned to keep a low profile but then became vocal on, among other issues, organ donation. Margaret Trudeau, the ex-wife of former PM Pierre Trudeau (and, later, mother to the younger Trudeau), actively engaged in political campaigning—something that hadn’t been the case for her predecessors. She spoke at public events, introduced Trudeau at rallies, and backed local candidates in tightly contested ridings.\n\nWith her impressive academic and professional credentials, Fox Carney has just as much to offer. There could be areas of conflict—for instance, why Fox Carney isn’t translating her environmental expertise to the new position. “Maybe because the role itself is an ill-defined one, it means that the solutions, and how to navigate it, is also ill-defined,” Reid points out.\n\nIndeed, perhaps Fox Carney’s inactivity could be strategic because of how politicized the climate crisis has become. Case in point: her husband axed the carbon tax as soon as he took office. And with the passing of the controversial Bill C-5, many Indigenous leaders and opposing politicians are upset at the law’s powerful potential to weaken environmental protections already in place. \n\nBut even if there isn’t any conflict of interest, is it imperative that Fox Carney be more involved? “I’ve always seen it as a personal choice,” says Reid. “We have to remember that she’s not the one who ran for office. I chose to be very active and to speak up, but I don’t think people should be under an obligation to do that. If we want to make it compulsory for spouses of world leaders to do these things, then I think we should pay them.”\n\nIn this way, being a first lady in Canada is fundamentally different from being one in the US, where the position, while unofficial, comes with an office and staff. In Canada, the prime minister’s spouse has no formal role or institutional support, and technically isn’t even the partner of a head of state. As a result, the title “first lady” doesn’t really apply in the same way.\n\nReid has already lived through what comes after. Jóhannesson chose not to seek a third term in 2024 and returned to academia. Reid has mixed feelings about that part of her life being over. “I’m glad I don’t have to wear makeup as much,” she quips. \n\nFor now, Fox Carney seems content to keep things low-key and play ceremonial sidekick, appearing when protocol demands it. “I think the way she views it,” says Senack, “is she will do her duty when called upon, but he’s the one who signed up to be prime minister.”\n\nTechnically, it is early days, so of course, a lot could still happen. “I’d be curious to see if anything changes,” says Senack. Who knows? She might just follow suit and make her own mark on the role after all.","summary":"Months after the federal election, Canada’s unofficial “first lady” remains an enigma\n\n\nThe post Diana Fox Carney Is Trying Hard Not to Be Noticed first appeared on The Walrus.","url":"https://thewalrus.ca/diana-fox-carney-is-trying-hard-not-to-be-noticed/","image":"https://walrus-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/img/WEB_TheReluctantFirstLady_SEPT25.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 10:30:08","author":"Wendy Kaur","authors":["Wendy Kaur"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.101},{"id":360614290,"title":"‘National embarrassment’: MAGA fight erupts","text":"On the one hand you have President Trump himself, who has sought to stoke anger at the “radical left”. On the other you have Utah Governor Spencer Cox, also a Republican, who is calling for calm and unity.\n\nMr Kirk was shot in Mr Cox’s state, which is dominated by the Republicans. On policy matters, the Governor is unquestionably conservative; Utah’s gun laws, for example, are very much on the permissive side. In fact Mr Cox recently signed a law that allows people in his state to carry concealed firearms in public places without requiring a permit.\n\nWhat could possibly go wrong there?\n\nMr Cox’s rhetoric, however, has long been stubbornly conciliatory, at a time when both sides of US politics have been speaking in increasingly hyperbolic and apocalyptic terms.\n\nWhat do I mean by hyperbolic?\n\nI mean Kamala Harris saying “democracy is on the ballot” before last year’s election, as though a win for Mr Trump would mean the end of a 250-year-old political system.\n\nI mean Mr Trump’s simultaneous insistence that, if his opponent were to win, “we are not going to have a country anymore”.\n\nMr Cox, who endorsed Mr Trump over Ms Harris, but only after the attempt on the now-President’s life during the election campaign, falls somewhere in between. He’s the sort of Republican who is genuinely friends with Democrats; he and the Democratic Governor of Maryland, Wes Moore, have reportedly been texting every day since Mr Kirk’s murder.\n\n(I’m not sure I even text my wife every day.)\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of Mr Kirk’s death, he sought to defuse, rather than inflame.\n\n“We mourn as a nation,” Mr Cox said.\n\n“If anyone celebrated even a little bit at the news of this shooting, I would beg you to look in the mirror and to see if you can find a better angel in there somewhere.\n\n“I don’t care what his politics are. I care that he was an American.\n\n“We desperately need leaders in our country, but more than the leaders, we just need every single person in this country to think about where we are and where we want to be.\n\n“We can return violence with fire and violence. We can return hate with hate. And that’s the problem with political violence, it metastasises, because we can always point the finger at the other side.\n\n“And at some point we have to find an off-ramp, or it’s going to get much, much worse. These are choices that we can make.”\n\nFor this attitude, he was condemned by elements of Mr Trump’s MAGA movement. Steve Bannon, for example, who was the President’s chief political adviser for a time during his first term, and remains an influential voice on the American right, with a popular podcast.\n\n(Mr Bannon also got caught defrauding Mr Trump’s supporters, having told them they were donating money to build the President’s border wall with Mexico before distributing the funds to his mates. He doesn’t really talk about that part of his resume.)\n\n“Spencer Cox is a national embarrassment,” he told The Daily Mail after the remarks above.\n\n“In a time when we need action, he tells us to sing kumbaya and hold hands with Antifa.”\n\nAntifa, which derives from the term “anti-fascist”, is a nebulous group of left-wing activists in the United States, often accused of stoking violence.\n\n“While the good and decent Charlie Kirk lies in a mortuary awaiting burial, he tells us to invite Democrats over for a cookout. The radical left, that burns Portland (a city in Oregon) daily and shoots up schoolkids weekly,” said Mr Bannon.\n\n“This is not a time for treacly pontificating. This is a time to declare Antifa a domestic terrorist organisation and have the FBI go kick down some doors.”\n\nPro-Trump journalist Julie Kelly was of a similar opinion.\n\n“It came across as grandstanding to me,” she said of Mr Cox’s remarks.\n\n“I don’t need to be lectured by Spencer Cox about how we should feel, think or act.”\n\nMs Kelly called Mr Cox’s speech an off-putting” call for “surrender”.\n\nMr Cox did the rounds on America’s various Sunday current affairs shows today, hitting back at Mr Bannon directly.\n\n“Mr Bannon is angry, and rightfully so,” he told CNN.\n\n“I’m not saying we have to just sing kumbaya and hold hands. What I’m saying is we actually should disagree. I think Charlie represented that better than anyone.\n\n“Charlie said some very inflammatory things. And in some corners of the web, that’s all people have heard.”\n\nHe stressed that Mr Kirk had “also said some other things about forgiveness”.\n\n“There are conflict entrepreneurs out there who benefit from radicalising us. And I’m not one of those. I don’t know that that’s particularly helpful,” he said.\n\n“That’s what I appreciate most about Charlie. If we don’t keep talking, that’s when the violence starts,” he added, referring to Mr Kirk.\n\n“But (Bannon) is right on this: we need to find out how this happened, and we need to stop it from happening (again).”\n\nHe lamented the fact that America’s politics now “feel like rage”.\n\n“It feels like rage is the only option,” said Mr Cox, urging supporters of Mr Kirk to “find an off-ramp” lest it get “much, much worse”.\n\n“We can choose a different path.”\n\nThe Governor invoked Mr Trump to support his case.\n\n“The President reached out to me after the press conference and thanked me multiple times for what I said. That might surprise some people,” he said.\n\n“The reason I’m doing these morning shows – I don’t do much national press anymore – is because the White House asked us to come on and talk about this. Because they are worried about the escalation that’s happening out there.”\n\nIf Mr Trump is genuinely worried about “the escalation that’s happening”, he’s done little to show it in his own public remarks.\n\n“I’ll tell you something that is going to get me in trouble, but I couldn’t care less,” he said on Fox News last Friday, when asked how America could fix the radicalisation of people on both the left and right.\n\n“The radicals on the right oftentimes are radical because they don’t want to see crime,” the President claimed.\n\n“The radicals on the left are the problem.”\n\nBefore that, in a video filmed in the Oval Office, he reeled off a list of examples of political violence aimed at Republicans, while omitting all examples of violence aimed at Democrats.\n\nSpeaking afterwards, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, very much a pro-Trump Republican, called for more temperate rhetoric.\n\n“People have got to stop framing simple policy disagreements in terms of existential threats to our democracy and all these phrases you hear all the time,” said Mr Johnson.\n\n“You can’t call the other side ‘fascists’ and ‘enemies of the state’ and not understand that there are some deranged people in our society who will take that as cues to act, and to do crazy and dangerous things.”\n\nHis remarks prompted inevitable compilations, on social media, of the times Mr Trump had called the Democrats fascists and derided the news media as an “enemy of the people”. Which sums up the hypocrisy, here, pretty damn well.","summary":"The pro-Trump politician in charge of the state where Charlie Kirk was shot is under fire after offering an alternative to the President’s stance.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/national-embarrassment-fight-erupts-within-maga-over-response-to-charlie-kirks-murder/news-story/74b7b3ff0d6fc627d6f716fe5a54c661?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/5df610b70d2deddb8804f18f7bc908a3","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 10:19:21","author":"Samuel Clench","authors":["Samuel Clench"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.097},{"id":360663666,"title":"PDP chieftain Plang dismisses insinuations Nentawe won’t deliver Tinubu, APC in 2027","text":"From Jude Owuamanam, Jos\n\nPlateau Central Senator Diket Plang and a chieftain of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Isaac Wadak, have dismissed insinuations that the National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Prof. Nentawe Yilwatda, lacks the capacity to lead the party and to return President Bola Ahmed Tinubu in the 2027 general elections.\n\nSpeaking to our correspondent in separate interviews in Jos against the backdrop of predictions by a cleric that Nentawe does not have what it takes to lead APC into the future and to deliver the presidency to the party in 2027, Plang and Wadak said that there is a world of difference between predictions and reality.\n\nWadak said Tinubu will not be unwise to place his destiny on the shoulders of a man whose capacity he doubts, adding that for the president to appoint Nentawe as the national chairman of APC, he (president) must have weighed all options, both the capacity and capability of the appointee to deliver.\n\n“We must understand the difference between predictions and prophecies. One is based on empirical data and analysis and the other divine. What primate dishes out to the public are mere predictions or better yet, his opinion or commentary on public or world affairs.

We pray that all of us holding offices, that we succeed for the benefit of the people with the present national leadership of the party. Human beings predict. Their prediction may come true or not. May the people of Plateau be a participant in the return of Tinubu in 2027. And for the fact that Tinubu has a hand in making our son a busy chairman, may we succeed in delivering him.

The political field is a competitive market. What the people want to buy by casting their votes for you is what you’re bringing into the market. So for me, I don’t think that the PDP are so ignorant, so unwise, that somebody will come into your house and divide you. If you are allowed to divide, it means you have a problem.

The suspect is also charged with the attempted murders of a Democratic state senator and his wife.\n\nRepublicans now hold a 67-66 seat edge in the state House. If Democrats hold Hortman’s seat in the heavily Democratic district, the chamber will once again be tied at 67-67. A Democratic vacancy earlier in the year prompted a Republican attempt to take control of the legislative body, but a boycott by House Democrats, led by Hortman, eventually resulted in a power-sharing agreement between the two parties.\n\nRunning to replace Hortman are Democrat Xp Lee, a former Brooklyn Park City Council member, and Republican Ruth Bittner, a real estate agent seeking her first elected office.\n\nBacked by the state party, Lee won the Aug. 12 Democratic primary with 59% of the vote over Brooklyn Park City Council member Christian Eriksen and Erickson Saye, an associate attorney in the Hennepin County attorney’s office.

Democrats have the biggest advantage in Brooklyn Park, where both Harris and Hortman received about 64% of the vote. Champlin is the most competitive. Harris and Hortman both won there with roughly 52% of the vote.\n\nBrooklyn Park has by far the largest presence in District 34B, comprising 11 of the district’s 14 precincts and about 85% of the district’s total vote. Two precincts are based in Coon Rapids and one in Champlin.\n\nThe Associated Press does not make projections and will declare a winner only when it’s determined there is no scenario that would allow the trailing candidates to close the gap.

In doing so, the AP will make clear that it has not yet declared a winner and explain why.\n\nThere are no automatic recounts for state legislative races in Minnesota. A losing candidate may request a publicly funded recount if the margin is less than 0.5% of the total vote.

Polls close at 8 p.m. local time, which is 9 p.m. ET.\n\nWhat’s on the ballot?\n\nThe Associated Press will provide vote results and declare a winner in the state House special election.\n\nWho gets to vote?\n\nAny voter registered in state House District 34B may participate in the special election.\n\nWhat do turnout and advance vote look like?\n\nThere were nearly 29,000 voters registered in House District 34B in the 2024 general election. Turnout was about 75% of registered voters in the 2024 general election and about 62% in 2022. About 44% of ballots in 2024 were cast before Election Day, compared with about 30% in the 2022 midterm elections.\n\nAs of Thursday, 812 ballots had been cast before Election Day, 95% of which came from Hennepin County. The remainder came from Anoka County.\n\nHow long does vote-counting usually take?\n\nIn the 2024 general election, the AP first reported results in District 34B at 11:29 p.m. ET. The tabulation ended for the night at 3:49 a.m. ET with more than 99% of total votes counted.\n\nAre we there yet?\n\nAs of Tuesday, there will be 413 days until the 2026 midterm elections.","summary":"If Democrats hold Hortman’s seat in the heavily Democratic district, the chamber will once again be tied at 67-67, edging out Republicans' current 67-66 control.\n\n\nThe post What to expect in the House special election for Melissa Hortman&#8217;s seat appeared first on MinnPost.","url":"https://www.minnpost.com/state-government/2025/09/what-to-expect-in-the-house-special-election-for-melissa-hortmans-seat/","image":"https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Hortman3-e1751124581449.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 10:00:00","author":"Associated Press,House Democrats,Robert Yoon","authors":["Associated Press","House Democrats","Robert Yoon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.217},{"id":360722054,"title":"New Yorker Covers, Brought to Life!","text":"But what if those images could spring to life, like Pygmalion’s statue? For The New Yorker’s centenary, the magazine asked six photographers to reinterpret covers from our archives as flesh-and-blood portraits, starring familiar faces. The role of Eustace went, this time around, to Spike Lee, who traded in the classic monocle for a movie camera. After all, isn’t Eustace a kind of filmmaker, zooming in for an extreme closeup of the butterfly? The artist Awol Erizku, known for turning Manet and Vermeer paintings into contemporary Black portraiture, posed Lee under a golden basketball net. Rea Irvin, meet the ultimate Knicks fan.\nCovers from the Jazz Age hold a glamorous mystique that proved especially enticing. Marilyn Minter adapted Barbara Shermund’s 1925 image of a goddess-like woman in grape-cluster earrings; Minter shot the actor Sadie Sink through glass, creating a dreamy haze. Julian de Miskey’s winking illustration of a soirée of cigarette-smoking swells in top hats and pearls, from 1930—what Great Depression?—was interpreted for a new age of glitter and doom by Alex Prager, featuring the actor and musician Sophie Thatcher and her identical twin, the artist Ellie Thatcher. And Stanley W. Reynolds’s 1926 depiction of a sailor canoodling with his lass struck Collier Schorr as resonant in an era of renewed discrimination against trans service members. In Schorr’s photograph, the duo, played by Julia Garner and Cole Escola, is more ambiguous, more gender-flouting, projecting an air of affectionate defiance. (An extra connection: Garner’s father, the artist Thomas Garner, has illustrated for The New Yorker.)\nJump ahead a few decades. Charles Saxon, a frequent contributor of New Yorker covers from 1959 until the late eighties, tended to draw besuited businessmen, but in 1974, when he was in his fifties, he rendered a gaggle of young bell-bottomed bohemians, perched at the base of a flagpole as if posing for a group photo. (You can almost smell the pot and patchouli oil.) To re-create the image, Ryan McGinley photographed some friends, including the countercultural comedian Julio Torres, at the New York Botanical Garden, in the Bronx, observing them less as curiosities than as peers. And Camila Falquez, whose subjects have included Zendaya and Kamala Harris, shot the Oscar-winning performer Ariana DeBose as the discerning woman with a magnifying glass drawn by Lorenzo Mattotti in 1999. None of these portraits go for detail-for-detail accuracy. Think of them as an elaborate game of dress-up, a century and change in the making.\nCasting: Lauren Tabach-Bank (DeBose, Garner, Sink).

As housing costs in Pilsen rise, newer Mexican American families are being driven to other neighborhoods.\n\nLike other Chicagoans, Pilsen residents have tended to be reliable Democrats. But in 2024, the neighborhood saw modest shifts toward Mr. Trump, with some residents saying they favored him on the issues of the economy and illegal immigration. Vice President Kamala Harris won the neighborhood overwhelmingly, but by a narrower margin than President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had in 2020, and in some places Mr. Trump’s vote totals were more than 20 percentage points higher in 2024 than in 2020.\n\nTensions escalated across the country over immigration in 2023 after Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas began sending busloads of asylum seekers from Central and South America to Chicago and other cities, saying that his own state was unfairly overwhelmed by people crossing the border. Chicago was inundated with people who had nowhere to stay, and some camped out on streets and filled up shelters and city facilities.\n\nThe Biden administration granted temporary deportation protections and work permits for many of the new arrivals from Venezuela. For some Mexican Americans, especially those with undocumented relatives or friends who had been in Chicago longer, the move was seen as unfair, creating resentment and division.\n\nThough many of the encampments are now gone, some bitter feelings have lingered.","summary":"Pilsen, a part of the city long home to Chicagoans of Mexican heritage, has grown quieter since the Trump administration announced an operation against illegal immigration.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/15/us/chicago-trump-ice-mexican-immigrants.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/16/multimedia/16-NAT-CHICAGO-NEIGHBORHOOD-01-PRINT/pilsen-chicago-1-fcjq-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 09:02:07","author":"Jazmine Ulloa","authors":["Jazmine Ulloa"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.237},{"id":360622670,"title":"Trump's DC crime success puts spotlight on Chicago's deadly 'war zone'","text":"President Donald Trump’s focus on crime across America is timely and necessary. It’s epidemic in many blue cities in our country, and something must, and can, be done about it. His crackdown in Washington, D.C., proves that dramatic reductions in crime in cities acclimatized to perpetual lawlessness and violence are possible, but only if you have the political courage to do so. Next up is Chicago, another city plagued by non-stop violent crime. Trump’s focus there has forced local leaders to defend their lax policies and deny the reality of rampant crime in their cities – claims that ring hollow to terrorized local residents. Before exposing the crime rates in Chicago and the lax policies that have caused them, let’s look at the results of the D.C. crime crackdown. In Washington, D.C., since the operation began on Aug. 7, arrests are up, homicides are down nearly 60%, and violent crime has decreased by 17%. In one two-week stretch, there wasn’t one homicide, which is, sadly, remarkable. TRUMP PRANKS DEMOCRATS INTO OPPOSING SOMETHING THEY'VE ALWAYS CLAIMED TO SUPPORT Despite this impressive decline, more effort is needed. There have been 106 homicides, 984 reported robberies and 3,157 car thefts this year alone. Those numbers are unacceptable in any city, especially the nation’s capital. Lax local laws passed by the D.C. City Council and local judges who give criminals a pass every day are major contributors to the city’s culture of violence. To fix these gaps, Congress is considering several proposals to fix the criminal justice system in D.C. permanently. As a developer who owns property in Chicago, Trump is quite familiar with the chronic crime carnage in the Windy City. The numbers speak for themselves, despite what Gov. JB Pritzker and Mayor Brandon Johnson declare. To put this carnage into perspective, between 2003 and 2010, 3,481 Americans were killed in action in Iraq, an average of 435 a year. In the war in Afghanistan, between 2001 and 2014, 1,833 Americans were killed in action, an average of 141 per year. In Chicago, between 2017 and 2024, there were 5,220 homicides, an average of 652 per year! Chicago is a war zone, pure and simple. PROGRESSIVE CITIES FACE BILLIONS IN ECONOMIC LOSSES AS RETAIL CRIME SURGES 93% SINCE 2019 Like in most big blue cities across America, there is a stark difference in crime rates between the richest and poorest parts of town. White liberal elites in the safest parts of town are oblivious to, or at least immune from, the constant drumbeat of violent crime in their own city. Chicago is a perfect example. District 3, which includes Hyde Park and Washington Park, had a homicide rate of 80.68 per 100,000 residents, according to 2024 Chicago Police Department data. District 6 (Englewood, Roseland, Woodlawn) had a rate of 73.43 per 100,000 residents. And District 11 (Humbolt Park, West Garfield Park, Near West Side), had a homicide rate of 72.86 per 100,000 residents. Compare those killing fields to Jefferson Park (1.97), Lincoln Square (2.29), and Uptown (3.27) – home to doctors, lawyers, venture capitalists and other professionals. Not surprisingly, liberal elites who live in those areas tend to be the ones who complain the loudest when Trump engages in increased federal enforcement, including offering much-needed assistance to state and local officials. TRUMP IS TRYING TO SAVE 100,000 AMERICAN LIVES WHILE DEMOCRATS LET CITIES SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL It’s also no coincidence that the first George Soros-backed \"progressive\" prosecutor, Kim Foxx, was in Chicago. As I detailed in my book, Foxx was hoisted from obscurity into office in 2017 with almost $700,000 of Soros-connected financial support. Foxx unleashed a tsunami of pro-criminal, anti-victim, anti-business policies on the city as its top prosecutor, causing a dramatic increase in violent crime. In the six years prior to that, there was an average of 510 homicides per year (2011–2016). In the three years before Foxx was elected, 4,460 rapes were reported to the police, an average of 1,486 per year. During Foxx’s tenure (2017–2022), 10,789 rapes were reported to the police, an average of 1,804 per year. Two weeks into the job, Foxx announced that she had raised the bar for prosecuting felony shoplifting from $300 per incident to $1,000 per incident, even though the law in Illinois was clear: felony shoplifting starts at $300. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION When she made that announcement, there were 101 people in Cook County Jail on felony retail theft charges. Ali Abid, a staff attorney at the Chicago Appleseed Fund for Justice, said, \"I think this is a really positive step.\" Abid’s boss, Malcolm Rich, was on Foxx’s transition team with then-Sen. Kamala Harris. But Rob Karr, the president of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, said he was \"extraordinarily shocked and disappointed,\" adding Foxx’s rewriting of the laws \"sends a message that retail theft is victimless and not serious… this is tantamount to declaring open season on retail stores.\" By 2019, three years into Foxx’s social experiment, Karr was proved right. Retail theft reports had skyrocketed across the city. In the ritzy Rush Street shopping district, reported incidents had more than doubled. And on State Street, retail theft cases were up 32%. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP President Trump’s use of the bully pulpit to highlight the high crime rates of Chicago and other blue cities is welcome news. Gone are the days of feel-good slogans about \"reimagining\" reform and \"mass incarceration.\" The Soros rogue prosecutor movement has failed, as has the \"defund the police\" and cashless bail experiment. Americans of all stripes want and deserve to live in safe neighborhoods. Thankfully, the national mood has shifted in the right direction on crime.

Social media users also expressed skepticism regarding CBS' claim that the cancellation was \"purely a financial decision\" and \"not related in any way to the show’s performance, content, or other matters happening at Paramount.\"This appeared to be a reference to Paramount's then ongoing attempts to secure the Trump administration's approval for a proposed merger with Skydance Media — efforts that some speculate may have coloured its recent decisions. In early July, Paramount agreed it would pay Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit in which he claimed they'd deceptively edited a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris to be favourable to her leading into November's presidential election. Paramount had previously called the lawsuit \"completely without merit,\" making its capitulation appear highly suspect to many.One such person Colbert himself, who has long been a vocal critic of Trump and who called out the settlement as a bribe. Trump subsequently responded to news of the Late Show's cancellation by stating that he \"absolutely love[ed] that Colbert got fired,\" and calling for other late shows such as Jimmy Kimmel Live to be cancelled next. The Trump administration approved the Skydance/Paramount merger one week after the Late Show's cancellation was announced.","summary":"Celebrities at the 2025 Emmy Awards showed their support for \"Late Night\" host Stephen Colbert after CBS cancelled the popular talk show.","url":"https://mashable.com/article/emmys-stephen-colbert-standing-ovation","image":"https://helios-i.mashable.com/imagery/articles/00HFEXdLQHYuux7fc4NYi3w/hero-image.fill.size_1200x675.v1757922885.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 08:08:21","author":"Amanda Yeo","authors":["Amanda Yeo"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":360595444,"title":"There’s no denying the trans links to suspect in Charlie Kirk’s assassination","text":"IT wasn’t until Utah Gov. Spencer Cox spelled out the transgender links to the suspect in Charlie Kirk’s assassination that The New York Times and the rest of the Hate Media and their social media offshoots finally gave up the absurd nudge-nudge wink-wink pretense that the killer was its favorite type of villain, a MAGA gun nut. \n\nNope, Tyler Robinson, 22, turns out to be a hard-core leftist, Antifa devotee and Kirk-hater who was living with his transgender boyfriend, identified as Lance Twiggs, 22, who claimed, “We are riding with Biden” in a 2022 post on the social media platform Reddit.\n\nThe two men also reportedly shared a sexual fetish for “furries,” anthropomorphic animal characters, with Twiggs pictured in photos online wearing animal headdress.\n\nIn the midst of an epidemic of left-wing political violence, you’d have to be pretty perverse not to understand the motive for assassinating Kirk.\n\nThe 31-year-old conservative leader was shot through the throat just as he was answering a question about transgender mass shooters.\n\n“Too many,” he replied to the question, “Do you know how many transgender Americans have been mass shooters over the last 10 years?”\n\nHe was silenced with a bullet to stop him from voicing an opinion held by the majority of Americans. \n\nThe next day podcaster Steven Crowder posted a screenshot of what he said was an ATF report showing that the cartridges found with the fatal weapon had engravings “expressing transgender and anti-fascist ideology.”\n\nSure enough, despite scoffing from the Hate Media, Crowder was right.\n\nThe Utah County Sheriff’s Office report described the Mauser bolt action rifle with scope found wrapped in a towel and stashed in a bush near the murder scene.\n\n“One spent cartridge, three live rounds recovered,” the report notes. “Investigators noted inscriptions that had been engraved on casings found with the rifle. Inscriptions on a fired casing read ‘Notices Buldge OWO what’s this?’\n\n“Inscriptions on the three unfired casings read: ‘hey fascist! CATCH!’ A second unfired casing read ‘O Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Bella ciao, Ciao, ciao!’ A third unfired casing read ‘if you read This, you are GAY Lmao’.”\n\n“Notices Buldge [sic] OWO what’s this?” is reportedly a meme related to “furries” and transgender people.\n\nThe two Antifa messages are more straightforward. But the New York Times coyly characterized the phrase “bella ciao” as “likely a reference to a popular Italian folk song with a sprawling cultural history.”\n\nHah. The Times didn’t want to illuminate its readers that “Bella Ciao,” an Italian anti-fascist WWII song, is “probably the most important rallying song to Antifa militants for decades,” as independent journalist Andy Ngo reports.\n\nAntifa terrorist Willem Van Spronsen cited the song in his “manifesto” before the deadly attack on an ICE facility in Tacoma, Wash., in 2019.\n\nBut the more recent deadly marriage of transgender and Antifa ideology is no surprise to anyone who has followed Ngo’s work the past six years.\n\nNgo has dubbed it “Trantifa,” and has charted the rise of the violent movement that hijacked BLM protests in the summer of 2020 and unleashed hell across the country, almost unnoticed by the Biden FBI and a media that bends over backwards not to notice leftwing terrorism or anything negative about transgenderism.\n\nA radical leftist trans militant cult of vegans, for instance, has been accused of the murder of a US Border Patrol agent near the Canadian border in January and other murders across the country.\n\nThe assassination of Kirk has lifted the veil of silence that hung over the threat posed by these unhinged nihilists.\n\nAnd after four years of Democrat pandering to the most extreme demands of transgender ideology, it was inevitable that there would be an explosion of rage after the American electorate rejected the madness last November.\n\nTrans rabbit hole \n\nPolling shows that transgender ideology is an 80-20 issue. While they believe in adults being able to do what they like, most Americans draw the line at transgender athletes competing in women’s sports, or children having gender ideology thrust down their throat to deliberately confuse them, or puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgical mutilation being provided to minors.\n\nThe most successful political advertisement President Trump ran during the 2024 campaign was about Kamala Harris bragging that she would make taxpayers fund transgender surgery for illegal aliens in jail.\n\nThe catchline of the ad was: “Donald Trump is for you, Kamala Harris is for they, them.”\n\nAnd yet Democrats keep falling down the rabbit hole.\n\nOn his first day in office, Joe Biden signed one of many executive orders to enforce the euphemistically titled “gender affirming care” for “trans kids.” \n\nOn Easter Saturday, 2023, who could forget Biden inviting a transgender person who pranced around the White House lawn exposing a pair of shaved and surgically created fake breasts.\n\nIn the Biden years, emboldened Democrats in blue states started pushing legislation that would make it a crime for parents not to “affirm” their child’s sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\nLast June Biden administration transgender health bureaucrat Adm. Rachel Levine pressured an international group of medical experts to remove all age limits for adolescent surgeries from guidelines for care of transgender minors, according to court documents reported in The New York Times.\n\nThe initial guidelines for the World Professional Association for Transgender Health recommended lowering the age minimums to 14 for hormonal treatments, 15 for mastectomies, 16 for breast augmentation or facial surgeries, and 17 for genital surgeries or hysterectomies.\n\nBut according to emails tendered to the court, Levine demanded the age limits be removed because they would “result in devastating legislation for trans care.”\n\nPeople like Robinson and Twiggs were told the lie by everyone from the president to their school counselors that it was possible for a man to become a woman.\n\nNow the Trump administration, inspired in large part by Kirk, has started to dismantle the whole sick edifice.\n\nKirk always spoke the truth, with compassion, but never sugarcoating the fact that biological sex is immutable. \n\nHe called the “transing” of children one of the greatest moral crimes of the century.\n\nHe told conservative media figure Ben Shaprio after the election last year that one of his “pet projects” was for the incoming Trump administration to “sign executive orders and launch a DOJ legal blitzkrieg in every gender-affirming care center in the country. . . We need criminal investigations, civil investigations.”\n\nHe said the “T” in LGBT stands for “tyrannical.” \n\n“It is that it is full totalitarian control of your speech, of your children, of your body . . . It cloaks itself on its surface, the trans agenda, as live and let live . . . And honestly, my temperament, I’m fine with [it]. I think it’s weird.\n\nBut OK, if you want to wear a dress in your living room, I’m not going to have a public policy measure against that.\n\n“But it’s never been about that. Instead, it’s, no, allow me to propagandize your 13-year-old child and then put them under general anesthesia and chop up their breasts because it’s good for them.”\n\nDecade of lies\n\nHe was right, and he was branded a “fascist” for telling the truth.\n\nIt ought to burn the consciences of The New York Times, The Washington Post, the Guardian and MSNBC, who have spent a decade lying that Donald Trump and his supporters like Kirk are fascists, Nazis, and an “existential threat” to our democracy.\n\nThat’s why I call them the Hate Media, because it’s the same technique used in the 1994 Rwandan genocide, where hate messages pumped out 24/7 on radio and by Hutu politicians dehumanized the Tutsi ethnic minority, branding them vermin to be exterminated, and inciting extremists to violence.\n\nThe result of years of 24/7 brainwashing was the slaughter of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 100 days.\n\nDemocrats and their Hate Media allies knew the risk of the signal they were sending to an unhinged subset of their followers, that fascists must be eliminated by any means necessary. \n\nNow it’s time for them to stop pretending that the motive for Kirk’s assassination is a mystery.\n\nStop lying that he was “divisive.”\n\nStop telling boys that they can be girls. \n\nTell the truth. Atone. Then the country can heal.","summary":"The 31-year-old conservative leader was shot through the throat just as he was answering a question about transgender mass shooters.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/09/15/opinion/theres-no-denying-the-trans-links-to-suspect-in-charlie-kirks-assassination-miranda-devine/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/111452185.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 08:03:12","author":"Miranda Devine","authors":["Miranda Devine"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.016},{"id":360611324,"title":"Schoen: Kamala Harris’ book rips open Dem wounds, does her no favors","text":"If Democrats hoped that their wounds from the 2024 election would soon begin healing, former Vice President Kamala Harris just ripped open the scab. \n\nHarris’ book, “107 Days,” is due to be released on Sept. 23, but an excerpt was published by The Atlantic. In it, the former VP holds little back, risking renewed infighting among a Democratic party struggling to find its way.\n\nUnfortunately, based on the excerpt, Harris’ book will do nothing to help the larger party, nor herself. Despite ostensibly her best efforts, it is remarkably self-serving.\n\nIn just a few words, Harris criticized Biden’s decision to run for a second term, claimed that his administration undercut her from the start, and revealed significant frustrations towards the former president and those around him. \n\nIndeed, Harris slammed certain decisions Biden made, but none more than his most fateful: seeking a second term when so many Americans felt he was too old, a recognition that the issue will still be critical in 2028.\n\nAcknowledging that “At 81, Joe got tired,” Harris describes a reluctant acceptance of “Joe and Jill’s decision” to run again. \n\nAnd, despite recognizing that “this wasn’t a choice that should have been left to an individual’s ego, an individual’s ambition,” Harris says that she and others were “hypnotized” into acquiescence, which she describes as “recklessness.”\n\nHarris’ harshest criticism, however, was reserved for Biden’s advisors. \n\nAs she describes it, Biden’s team either stuck her with unsolvable policy issues – the border – or totally sidelined her. \n\nShe went further, accusing the Biden White House of “showing little interest in defending her against attacks from Republicans.”\n\nOn the contrary, Harris believes that “the president’s staff was adding fuel to the negative narratives around me” and left her to “shoulder the blame for a porous border.”\n\nFor issues where Harris polled better than Biden, such as abortion, Harris writes that Biden’s advisors refused to give her credit out of what she said was their belief that “if she’s shining, he’s dimmed.” \n\nHarris’ anger at the Biden White House is clear. What is less evident is any sense of responsibility or agency on her part.\n\nNor, for a vice president who consistently touted her loyalty to Biden on the campaign trail, is there any evidence of that same loyalty now. \n\nHarris ran a campaign centered on, by her own admission, an inability to find anything on which she disagreed with Biden, yet now, has a book full of places where she found daylight between the two.\n\nIn fact, in this excerpt, there’s little on the myriad of Biden decisions which actually helped her. Specifically, tapping her for VP, giving her a platform bigger than most VPs get, or, most importantly, almost immediately backing her for president when he withdrew from the race.\n\nTaken together, while Harris’ frustration with – and attempt to distance herself from – the Biden White House is obvious, the timing is wrong, the degree of disloyalty is great, and her lack of political judgement is more than apparent.\n\nOf course, this is only one excerpt of a larger book. But still, the Harris camp chose this excerpt for a reason, indicating their belief that the information it contained is critical.\n\nTo that end, the excerpt has already begun ripping open old wounds, prompting rebuttals and personal attacks on Harris from Biden staffers. \n\nAccording to Politico, one former Biden White House official pushed back on Harris’ characterization of the administration, saying, “No one wants to hear your pity party.”\n\nA national Democratic strategist was even harsher, saying that Harris’ “criticisms weren’t on the substance…but it was on them not doing enough to promote her and have her back in the press…it speaks to why she lost.”\n\nWhen the full book is published, it’s possible that these wounds will deepen, infecting the entire Democratic Party at an incredibly vulnerable time.\n\nSince the 2024 election, Democrats have been embroiled in intra-party finger pointing, trying to figure out who is responsible for all of the things that went wrong. \n\nBy dint of her position in the administration, Harris’ book is certain to reignite that debate. Even more so as it comes at a time when Democrats have been virtually unable to mount any form of effective opposition to the Trump administration.\n\nIn that same vein, the popularity of Harris’ book will draw renewed attention to the Biden administration’s issues when Democrats should be looking towards the 2026 midterms and then to the 2028 primary.\n\nAnd yet, for Harris, the book will likely be the starting point for her own presidential campaign. \n\nIn taking pains to highlight her own successes in office while blaming any and all stumbles on Team Biden, Harris is clearly hoping that voters will not associate her with a Biden administration that was deeply unpopular.\n\nOr, in Harris’ own words, “When polls indicated that I was getting more popular, the people around him (Biden) didn’t like the contrast that was emerging.”\n\nMoreover, by stressing that there was never a cover up of Biden’s infirmities, and attributing Biden’s candidacy to “Joe and Jill” – as well as “an individual’s ego” – Harris appears to be trying to acknowledge the problem without taking full responsibility.\n\nThe issue over who in the administration knew what about Biden’s age will almost certainly be an issue in the 2028 primary, and attempting to get her side of the story out there is critical. \n\nAs such, laying the fault at Biden’s advisors – who she describes as freezing her out from the beginning – appears to be her “out.”\n\nNevertheless, Harris’ book threatens to drive a wedge among the Democratic base between those who backed Biden throughout 2024, and younger, progressives who did not.\n\nThe Atlantic’s Jeffery Goldberg, who read the book in its entirety, said he was “expecting lawyerly calibration and discretion.” But he soon saw that “she no longer seems particularly interested in holding back.”\n\nUltimately, the political impact of Harris no longer holding back remains to be seen, both on her and on the wider Democratic Party. \n\nAt this point, however, we can be reasonably certain that the ramifications will be significant for both. \n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"If Democrats hoped that their wounds from the 2024 election would soon begin healing, former Vice President Kamala Harris just ripped open the scab. ","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/09/15/kamala-harris-book-rips-open-democratic-wounds-and-does-her-no-favors/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Election_2024_How_We_Got_Here_64999.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 07:28:39","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.426},{"id":360555950,"title":"Stephen Colbert receives standing ovation as he delivers defiant Emmy acceptance speech after show cancellation","text":"Late night host Stephen Colbert received a standing ovation at the Emmy Awards Sunday night - two months after CBS announced it would be canceling his show. \n\nThe 61-year-old comedian accepted the award for Best Talk Series, which his show won over The Daily Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live! \n\nDespite the cancellation he thanked the network and revealed his hope for the network to continue the show as he said: 'I want to thank CBS were giving us the privilege to be part of the late-night tradition, which I hope continues long after we are no longer doing this show.'\n\nHe thanked the crew for the chat show and his entire family before ending on a sweet, positive, and patriotic note.\n\nStephen said: 'I have never loved my country more desperately.

He now owns a grain and hog farm near Moscow, Iowa - but he's unsure about its prospects.\n\n\"I'm in a little bit of a worried place,\" says Mr Maxwell, who wears a baseball cap bearing the logo of a corn company.\n\nHe is concerned that American farmers aren't able to sell their crops to international markets in the way they could in previous years, in part because of the fallout from President Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"Our yields, crops and weather are pretty good - but our [interest from] markets right now is on a low,\" he says. \"It's going to put stress on some farmers.\"\n\nHis fears are not unique. US agricultural groups warn that American farmers are facing widespread difficulty this year, mostly due to economic tensions with China. Since April, the two countries have been locked in a trade war, causing a sharp fall in the number of Chinese orders for American crops.\n\nAmerican farmers are wounded as a result, economists say. The number of small business bankruptcies filed by farmers has reached a five-year high, according to data compiled by Bloomberg in July.\n\nWith all this economic pain, rural areas could well have turned against Trump. But that doesn't seem to be happening.\n\nRural Americans were one of the president's most loyal voting blocs in last year's election, when he won the group by 40 percentage points over Kamala Harris, beating his own margins in 2020 and 2016, according to Pew Research analysis.\n\nPolling experts say that in the countryside, he is still broadly popular.\n\nMr Maxwell says he is sticking with Trump, despite his own financial worries. \"Our president told us it was going to take time to get all these tariffs in place,\" he says.\n\n\"I am going to be patient. I believe in our president.\"\n\nSo why do so many farmers and other rural Americans broadly continue to back Trump even while feeling an economic squeeze that is driven in part by tariffs - the president's signature policy?\n\nFarmers on a 'trade and financial precipice'\n\nIf you want a window into rural America, the Iowa State Fair is a good start. The agricultural show attracts more than one million visitors over 10 days.\n\nThere is candy floss; deep-fried hot dogs on a stick for $7 (£5) - known as \"corn dogs\"; an antique tractor show; a competition for the biggest boar.\n\nBut when the BBC visited last month, there was another topic of conversation: tariffs.\n\n\"A lot of people say he's just using tariffs as a bargaining chip, as a bluff,\" says Gil Gullickson, who owns a farm in South Dakota and edits an agriculture magazine.\n\n\"But I can say: history proves that tariffs don't end well.\"\n\nIn April, what he termed \"liberation day\", Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on most of the world, including a 145% tariff on China.\n\nIn response, China put a retaliatory 125% tariff on American goods - a blow to farmers in the American Midwest, sometimes known as the \"corn belt\", many of whom sell crops to China.\n\nLast year Chinese companies bought $12.7bn (£9.4bn) worth of soybeans from America, mostly to feed their livestock.\n\nSeptember is harvest season, and the American Soybean Association (ASA) has warned that soybean orders from China are way below where they should be at this point in the year.\n\nTariffs have fluctuated dramatically since they were introduced - and the uncertainty is proving tough for farmers, says Christopher Wolf, a professor of agricultural economics at Cornell University.\n\n\"China is just so big that when they buy things, it matters - and when they don't, it matters.\"\n\nThe cost of fertiliser has rocketed, too - partly because of trade disputes with Canada, which has raised the cost of potash, a salt imported from Canada by American farmers and used in fertiliser.\n\nJon Tester, a former Democrat Senator of Montana, who is a third-generation farmer, told a US news station earlier this month: \"With all these tariffs the president's put on, it's interrupted our supply chain… it's increased the cost of new equipment… and because of the trade and tariffs, a lot of customers have said to heck with the United States…\n\n\"The people who are new to agriculture, those young farmers who haven't saved money for times like this, they're going to be in trouble and a lot of those folks are going to go broke.\n\n\"And if this continues, a lot of folks like me are going to go broke too.\"\n\nAmerican farmers already suffer from high levels of stress. They are more than three times more likely than average to die by suicide, according to a paper by a charity, the National Rural Health Association, which analysed a period before Trump's presidency.\n\nIn a letter to the White House, Caleb Ragland, president of the ASA, warned of a tipping point: \"US soybean farmers are standing at a trade and financial precipice.\"\n\nTrump: 'Our farmers are going to have a field day'\n\nSupporters of President Trump say that his tariffs will help American farmers in the long run, by forcing countries like China to come to the negotiating table and agree new deals with the US over agriculture.\n\nAnd they point to other ways this White House has helped farmers. Over the summer, as part of Trump's tax and spend bill, his administration expanded federal subsidies for farmers by $60bn (£44bn), and boosted funding for federal crop insurance.\n\nIn his annual speech to Congress in March, Trump warned farmers of a \"little bit of an adjustment period\" following the tariffs, adding: \"Our farmers are going to have a field day… to our farmers, have a lot of fun, I love you.\"\n\nSid Miller, commissioner of the Texas Department of Agriculture, is among those who have praised Trump for his \"vital support\".\n\n\"We finally have an administration that is prioritising farmers and ranchers,\" he wrote in a statement earlier this year. \"They advocate for farmers, challenge China ... and ensure America's producers are receiving fair treatment.\"\n\nAnd it is possible the president's tariff strategy could eventually work, according to Michael Langemeier, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University.\n\nBut he also worries that uncertainty is inflicting long-term damage. \"Your trading partner doesn't know exactly what your position's going to be next year, because it seems like we're changing the goalposts.\n\n\"That is a problem.\"\n\nTariffs will make us great again\n\nThere's an old adage in American politics that says people \"vote with their pocketbooks\" - and turn against politicians if they appear to harm their finances.\n\nYet despite financial pressures, the rural Americans we spoke to are firmly sticking with Trump.\n\nExperts say they haven't seen any evidence of meaningful change in support among rural voters since last year. A survey by Pew last month found that 53% of rural Americans approve of the job Trump is doing, far higher than the 38% figure for the country as a whole.\n\nThough a survey by ActiVote earlier this month did find a small decline in Trump's approval among rural voters from 59% in August to 54% in September. Analysts warn not to pay too much attention to those shifts, however, because the number of rural voters included in those polls is so small.\n\n\"The data I've seen suggests Trump is still heavily supported in rural communities,\" says Michael Shepherd, a political science professor at the University of Michigan who focuses on rural politics.\n\nFor some farmers at the state fair, the explanation is simple: they believe the US president when he tells them that tariffs will help them in the long run.\n\n\"We think the tariffs eventually will make us great again,\" says John Maxwell, a dairy farmer and cheese producer from Iowa.\n\n\"We were giving China a lot, and [previously] we paid tariffs when we sold to them. Let's make it fair. What's good for the goose is good for the other goose.\"\n\nSome may also hold onto hope that the president will bail farmers out. During Trump's first term he gave farmers a $28bn (£20.7bn) grant amid a tariff dispute with China.\n\nA case of selective blame attribution?\n\nFor Nicholas Jacobs, a politics professor at Colby College and author of The Rural Voter, there's a deeper reason at play.\n\n\"It's easy for an outsider to ask, 'Why the hell are you still with this guy?'\" he says. \"But you have to understand that across rural America, the move towards Republicans long predates Donald Trump.\"\n\nStarting in the 1980s, he says, rural Americans started to feel alienated and left behind while cities benefited from globalisation and technological change.\n\nWhat he calls a \"rural identity\" formed, based on a shared grievance and an opposition to urban liberals. The Republicans seemed like their natural champion, while he says the Democrats became \"the party of the elite, technocrats, the well-educated, the urbane\".\n\nSome repeat that sentiment at the state fair. Joan Maxwell, a dairy farmer from Davenport in Iowa, says that her area is too often viewed as \"flyover country\".\n\n\"We are not looked at very positively for the most part from the media,\" she says. \"We've been called deplorables, uneducated,\" - a reference to Hillary Clinton's description of half of Trump's supporters as a \"basket of deplorables\".\n\nMs Maxwell added: \"A lot of times they ignore us or make fun of us.\"\n\nProf Shepherd, of Michigan University, believes there's another factor: in his view, America has become so polarised - with voters from both sides entrenched in their camps - that many are willing to forgive much more than they would previously, as long as it's a policy implemented by their own side.\n\nHe calls this \"selective blame attribution… they might be really angry about some things that are happening, but they're reticent to blame Trump for them.\"\n\n'We're giving him a chance - there'd better be results'\n\nMr Wolf has his own view on the \"best case scenario\" from here. \"What I hope happens is that he [Trump] just declares victory and leaves it [tariffs] alone.\"\n\nBut he warns that even if the policy is dropped, the damage to American farmers could be long-term due to the shake-up to supply chains. Some Chinese firms are now buying their soybeans from Brazil rather than America, he says; they may not quickly return.\n\nMany of the analysts we spoke to believe that rural America's support for Trump is not a blank cheque, despite their current support.\n\nMr Shepherd points to the Great Depression and rural \"Dustbowl\" of the 1930s, which forced millions of farmers to migrate to American cities, causing a long-term realignment in politics - though nobody expects it to get anywhere near that bad this time. The farm crisis of the 1980s also saw thousands of farms go under.\n\nBack at the state fair, Ms Maxwell, the Iowan dairy farmer, makes this point clear.\n\n\"We're giving him the chance to follow through with the tariffs, but there had better be results. I think we need to be seeing something in 18 months or less.\n\n\"We understand risk - and it had better pay off.\"","summary":"He is concerned that American farmers aren't able to sell their crops to international markets in the way they could in previous years, in part because of the fallout from President Trump's tariffs.","url":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/us-farmers-are-being-squeezed-and-its-testing-their-deep-loyalty-to-trump/","image":"https://www.myjoyonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-1228.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 02:46:00","author":"Abubakar Ibrahim,Bbc 46am","authors":["Abubakar Ibrahim","Bbc 46am"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.007},{"id":360536266,"title":"“The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” wins at the 2025 Emmys after getting canceled","text":"The Late Show With Stephen Colbert just won another Emmy before signing off for good.\n\n During Sunday's star-studded awards ceremony, Stephen Colbert's long-running late-night show won Outstanding Talk Series, only two months after CBS — the network also airing tonight's Emmys — made the controversial decision to cancel it.\n\n The entire audience gave Colbert a standing ovation and chanted \"Stephen! Stephen! Stephen!\" as the host and his creative team walked up to the mic.\n\n \"I want to thank CBS for giving us the privilege to be part of the late-night tradition, which I hope continues long after we're no longer doing this show,\" Colbert said before thanking the entire team of \"200 incredible professionals\" who made the show in addition to his family. He then shouted out \"a young woman who should be here tonight, Amy Cole,\" paying tribute to his longtime executive assistant who died in March 2024 at age 53 after battling cancer.\n\n Colbert went on to remember the very beginning of his tenure hosting The Late Show.\n\n \"10 years ago, in September of 2015, Spike Jonze stopped by the office and said, 'Hey, what do you want this show to be about?'\" Colbert said. \"And I said, 'Ah, Spike, I don't know how you could do it, but I'd kind of like do a late-night show, a late-night comedy show, that was about love.'\"\n\n While Colbert was never sure if he \"ever figured that out,\" he realized \"at a certain point, and you can guess what that point was,\" that they were actually making a late-night comedy show \"about loss.\"\n\n \"And that's related to love, because sometimes you only truly know how much you love something when you get a sense that you might be losing it,\" Colbert added. \"10 years later, in September of 2025, my friends, I have never loved my country more desperately. God bless America, stay strong, be brave, and if the elevator tries to bring you down, go crazy and punch a higher floor!\"\n\n The Late Show's new trophy joins the one that Jim Hoskinson won at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys for Outstanding Directing for a Variety Series (for the episode, \"David Oyelowo, Finn Wolfhard, Special Appearance by Alan Cumming, Performance By Ok Go\"). That was the franchise's first-ever Emmy win after it was nominated 33 times since its debut in 2015. \n\n The show beat out fellow nominees The Daily Show and Jimmy Kimmel Live! — likely helped by the fact that Jimmy Kimmel himself even campaigned and voted for his friend Colbert because it's \"the least we could do at this point.\"\n\n \"I think it will be a nice statement if he does win,\" Kimmel previously said. \"Obviously, awards don't mean much, but every once in a while they do, and in this case, I think it will. I fully expect Stephen to win the Emmy as I think people are very, very upset about what happened to him and his show.\"\n\n The industry backlash against CBS for canceling the series has been swift and intense. Sen. Elizabeth Warren — who has been candid about her disapproval over Paramount settling the lawsuit brought by Trump over a 2024 60 Minutes interview with his contender in that year's presidential election, Kamala Harris — is among the most vocal critics calling out the deal as \"bribery.\"\n\n In July, CBS announced that The Late Show would officially be coming to an end in May 2026. While the network noted at the time that the cancellation was \"purely a financial decision,\" critics have questioned if the then-pending merger of Paramount Global to Skydance Media — which required the approval of the Trump administration — played a factor as well. The FCC approved the merger on July 24, eight days after Colbert announced the show's cancellation on air.\n\n \"We consider Stephen Colbert irreplaceable and will retire The Late Show franchise,\" CBS said in a statement. \"We are proud that Stephen called CBS home. He and the broadcast will be remembered in the pantheon of greats that graced late night television. This is purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night. It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\"\n\n Sign up for Entertainment Weekly's free daily newsletter to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.\n\n Trump celebrated news of The Late Show's cancellation on social media, writing that Colbert's \"talent was even less than his ratings.\" In the wake of the news, Colbert has not backed down on openly criticizing Trump and his administration throughout the president's second term. Reacting to Trump's post about his cancellation, Colbert said, \"How dare you, sir. Would an untalented man be able to compose the following satirical witticism: Go f--- yourself.\"\n\n Colbert officially took over as host of The Late Show in September 2015, replacing David Letterman, who launched the franchise in August 1993. When Letterman hosted the show, it won nine Emmys.\n\n Before these two Late Show wins, Colbert already won 10 Emmys for The Colbert Report and his special, Stephen Colbert’s Election Night 2020: Democracy’s Last Stand: Building Back America Great Again Better 2020.","summary":"CBS announced in July that Colbert's late night series will end next year, claiming it was \"purely a financial\" decision.","url":"https://ew.com/the-late-show-with-stephen-colbert-wins-after-getting-canceled-emmys-2025-11809402","image":"https://ew.com/thmb/yghCxQmbf_jqxVYyOMq4SJ6_Xk0=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Stephen-Colbert-2025-Emmys-091425-3a5e6288a4bb401595f4555313ea4d21.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-15 02:43:41","author":"Sydney Bucksbaum","authors":["Sydney Bucksbaum"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.041},{"id":360524702,"title":"Farmers are being squeezed - it's testing their loyalty to Trump","text":"His fears are not unique.

I wish his message would die with him.”\n\nIn an article titled “Charlie Kirk and the Empathy Trap” — with the subhead, “Democrats will never be as cruel as Republicans after a political assassination. That’s to their credit. But it may not be to their advantage” — the magazine derided conservative outrage and mocked reports of leftists celebrating Kirk’s murder, declaring: “You can go online and nut-pick the odd leftist making light of Charlie Kirk’s death.” \n\nIt then dismissed Democratic leaders’ official statements — Kamala Harris saying, “Political violence has no place in America,” Hakeem Jeffries declaring it is “completely incompatible with American values,” and Gabby Giffords, herself a survivor of gun violence, warning that “We must never allow America to become a country that confronts those disagreements with violence.”\n\nThe author argued that such remarks only showed weakness, declaring that “these denunciations of political violence are too tasteful for the moment,” and adding, “piously expressing respect for Kirk’s work and incanting the importance of ‘debate’ are capitulations to Republicans’ invoking standards to which the right no longer pretends to adhere.” \n\nThe piece went further: “Actually, it’s worse: There are no Republicans asking or demanding that their Democratic counterparts play the part of sympathetic colleague.” Democrats, it claimed, “reflexively” react that way, and “it still surprises them when the notoriously remorseless refuse to reciprocate.”\n\nThe New Republic pressed its case by praising Republican “shamelessness,” seizing on an isolated episode from three months ago when Utah Sen. Mike Lee posted mocking memes on X about the assassination of Minnesota Speaker Melissa Hortman — posts he later removed. From that, the author insisted, “using the awesome power of U.S. government to compound people’s grief is exactly how Republicans measure success.” \n\nThe demand followed: “Democrats must adopt some version of that metric for themselves. They do not need to be cruel, but they can’t shy away from speaking plainly even if they offend. Next to that sort of shamelessness, a willingness to shove Republicans’ faces in the consequences of their actions is maybe still too mild.”\n\nThe article described Democrats as defined by compassion: \n\nWe are trained in dignity and empathy. It’s where our politics come from. It’s why we care about gay people and trans people and immigrants and the working class. We believe empathy matters, and we act like it matters.\n\nYet it immediately dismissed that instinct, arguing that “it has gotten us nowhere, even when we ask for empathy around gun violence more objectively — at least quantitatively — horrific than what befell Charlie Kirk in Utah. The deaths of children in the most violent fashion imaginable have done nothing to turn the Republican Party away from their lurid embrace of killing machines.”\n\nThe author resurrected Kirk’s words from years ago about the Second Amendment, repurposing them as evidence to condemn him after his death. Years earlier, Kirk had remarked, “I think it’s worth it to have a cost of, unfortunately, some gun deaths every single year so that we can have the Second Amendment … That is a prudent deal. It is rational.” \n\nThe article sneered in response: “Nobody talks like this, either: Charlie Kirk was right. Gun deaths are the inevitable outcome of valuing the Second Amendment over all the others.” And then the line aimed squarely at his family: “I can’t imagine that Kirk’s family finds it ‘a prudent deal.’”\n\nFrom there, the rhetoric sharpened. \n\nThe article asked, “What is the upside to empathy these days, politically speaking? What are liberals or Democrats gaining by reaching a hand across the aisle to join in grief? The warm, fuzzy feeling of having done the right thing will hopefully be enough, because that’s all there is.” \n\nIt then spelled out the approach: “The tone I’m envisioning is callous, perhaps, but short of cruel,” even proposing lines such as, “‘I’m sorry his family is suffering. I wish his message would die with him.’ … ‘No one deserves to die an untimely death, even Charlie Kirk, a supporter of policies that have killed people far more innocent than him.’”\n\nThe piece warned Democrats to stop framing political violence as an aberration. “Stay away from the invocation that political violence is an aberration. Instead, point out that Trump, cheerled by Kirk, has normalized it.” One example suggested is: “This is a horrible crime. Maybe Donald Trump should consider sending the National Guard to Utah.” \n\nThe piece highlights how Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) was praised for refusing to soften her rhetoric. Asked if Democrats would dial it back, she snapped: “Oh, please. Why don’t you start with the president of the United States? And every ugly meme he’s posted and every ugly word.”\n\nTo justify this hard line, the author pointed to Kirk’s past rejection of compassion.\n\nThe essay concluded by contrasting the two parties’ reactions to violence, with the author declaring that “when someone tried to assassinate Donald Trump, Democratic leaders fell over themselves to release the appropriate statements.” \n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, “refused to hold hands and instead pointed their fingers at Democrats, despite the evidence that the shooter’s ideology was, at best, confused.” The piece added that they “hailed Trump as a hero and sold T-shirts with images of the incident” and “reframed the 2024 election as a vigilante operation.” The warning was blunt: “I fear we are about to see the same playbook run again.”\n\nThe New Republic left no doubt about what it was advocating: “The last real surge leftward in American politics came after George Floyd’s murder … The lesson shouldn’t be ‘Don’t squeeze a tragedy for political capital.’ The lesson should be, look at what can happen if you do.”\n\nThe matter comes as many on the left have openly celebrated the political violence. In the wake of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk’s shocking assassination, leftists flooded social media to mock, deride, and even cheer his death. A new website, Charlie’s Murderers, has since launched with the stated goal of exposing those who targeted and vilified Kirk in his final moments.\n\nJoshua Klein is a reporter for Breitbart News.

Jim Edgar, the two-term Republican credited with steering the state toward greater fiscal stability in the 1990s, has died. He was 79. Edgar’s family said he died from complications related to his treatment for pancreatic cancer; the family added they were “deeply grateful for the love, support and kindness so many have shown to Jim and our family over these last several months.” Edgar, Illinois’ 38th governor, served two terms from 1991 to 1999 after a decade as the state’s secretary of state. A native of Oklahoma, who grew up in Charleston, Illinois, he earned a bachelor’s degree from Eastern Illinois University and began his political career in the Illinois House before rising through state government.Elected governor as a pragmatic, fiscally focused Republican, Edgar took office with the state facing a severe budget shortfall and months-long delays in paying bills. Amid a national recession, he pushed through budget cuts and made permanent a temporary income-tax surcharge that had been intended to stabilize funding, particularly for public schools, steps that supporters say helped bring Illinois’ finances into better balance during the 1990s. Edgar himself told The Associated Press in 1998 that “it wasn’t always pretty how it was done, but we got a lot done. We went after some pretty tough issues. We didn’t get them all, but we got most of them.”Edgar’s political style was broadly seen as moderate and managerial rather than theatrical. He surprised observers by announcing in 1997 that he would not seek a third term despite high approval ratings, and he repeatedly declined later efforts to return to elective office, even after Republicans tried to draft him for US Senate and gubernatorial runs. After leaving office he taught and served as president emeritus of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation, among other public roles. In recent years Edgar grew publicly uneasy with the national Republican Party’s rightward shift. He was one of several prominent GOP figures in Illinois who joined a “Republicans for Harris” effort that supported then-Sen. Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential campaign, a notable cross-party public stance. Live Events“By any standard, he was a Republican whose integrity guided his time in office and who managed one of the most successful periods in Illinois state government,” Bob Kustra, who served as Edgar’s lieutenant governor, said in a statement.Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker said Sunday that flags in the state would fly at half-staff in Edgar’s honor. “Now more than ever, we should channel that spirit and resolve to live as Governor Edgar did: with honesty integrity, and an enduring respect for all,” Pritzker, a Democrat, said in a statement. “He will live on in the incalculable number of lives he touched and in the stronger institutions he helped build.”Edgar is survived by his wife and two children. His relatives said funeral arrangements would be announced in the coming days.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!\n (You can now subscribe to our Economic Times WhatsApp channel)\n\nRead More News onJim Edgarpancreatic cancerbudget cutsRepublican PartyIllinois state governmentpolitical careerformer Illinois governorAbraham Lincoln Presidential Library FoundationKamala Harris\n\n(Catch all the US News, UK News, Canada News, International Breaking News Events, and Latest News Updates on The Economic Times.)

His family said he passed away due to complications from treatment for pancreatic cancer, which he had publicly disclosed earlier this year. Career And Political Achievements Edgar began his political career as a state legislator and later served 10 years as Illinois Secretary of State. He was elected governor in 1990, winning re-election easily, including in heavily Democratic Cook County, home to Chicago. During his tenure, Edgar focused on stabilizing Illinois’ finances. When he took office, the state faced hundreds of millions in debt and often paid bills months late. Amid a recession, he pushed legislators to cut the budget, implement layoffs, and make a temporary income tax surcharge permanent, providing a steady source of funding for public schools. Edgar was known as a moderate Republican who valued integrity and was often cautious and reserved compared to his predecessor, James R. Thompson. Even after leaving office, he remained a respected party figure, though he grew uneasy with the Republican Party’s shift to the right and did not support Donald Trump’s presidency, according to The Guardian. He joined a group supporting Kamala Harris’ campaign last year. Surprising many, Edgar chose not to run for a third term in 1997 despite his popularity. He later declined offers to run for the US Senate or return as governor. After politics, he taught and served as president emeritus of the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library Foundation. Tributes And Legacy Former Lieutenant Governor Bob Kustra praised Edgar, saying he was “a Republican whose integrity guided his time in office and who managed one of the most successful periods in Illinois state government.” Illinois Governor JB Pritzker ordered flags to fly at half-staff in Edgar’s honor, saying he exemplified honesty, integrity, and respect for all. “He will live on in the incalculable number of lives he touched and in the stronger institutions he helped build,” Pritzker added. Edgar is survived by his wife and two children. Funeral details are expected to be announced in the coming days.

Jim Edgar died Sunday after a battle with pancreatic cancer. He was 79.\n\nMr. Edgar died after being hospitalized due to a reaction to treatment for cancer. The former governor was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in January.\n\nIn February, Mr. Edgar told the Sun-Times he was fighting the deadly disease because he had “a lot to hold out for.”\n\n“I’ve told many people I want to stay around. I’ve got a few things I want to do and see. I want to see great-grandchildren. I kind of like to see my horses do a little better than they’ve done. So I’ve got a lot to hold out for. But to be very truthful, if it ended tomorrow, I’ve had a great life.”\n\nMr. Edgar was the state’s 38th governor, serving two terms from 1991 to 1999. He also served in the Illinois House of Representatives from 1976 to 1979 and as Illinois secretary of state from 1981 to 1991.\n\nHe was reelected by the widest plurality any incumbent Illinois governor has ever received, winning 101 of the state’s 102 counties, including Cook County.\n\nAfter retiring from office, Mr. Edgar was a resident fellow at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker on Sunday called Mr. Edgar a friend and mentor. He said flags across Illinois would fly at half-staff to honor Edgar’s legacy.\n\n“Now more than ever, we should channel that spirit and resolve to live as Governor Edgar did: with honesty, integrity, and an enduring respect for all,” Pritzker said in the statement.\n\nA moderate Republican, Mr. Edgar joined fellow Illinois Republicans last year in campaigning for Democrat Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign as part of the nationwide “Republicans for Harris” push.\n\nIn 2012, the former governor started the Edgar Fellows Program, which centers around developing young Illinois leaders and fostering mutual understanding between parties.\n\nLt. Gov. Julianna Stratton, who was part of the 2016 Edgar Fellows cohort, said Edgar’s legacy is one of lasting impact.\n\n“Former Governor Jim Edgar was a man of principle and a passionately dedicated civil servant,” Stratton said in a statement. “He saw past political divides and emphasized the importance of unity in leadership by making a point to always extend his hand across the aisle. He was practical, gave great advice, and did everything he could to build up the next generation of future leaders so that Illinois can continue to grow.”\n\nIn a July interview with Chicago Sun-Times staff reporter Fran Spielman, Mr. Edgar detailed the difficulties of chemotherapy and what he wanted his legacy to be. He said he was taking things “one day at a time,” and taking care of his horses to occupy himself.\n\n“I want people to think, ‘He was a good, good public servant, he did a good job. Didn’t always agree with him, but he tried to do what he thought was the right thing,’” Mr. Edgar said in the interview.\n\nThis is a developing story, check back for updates.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/obituaries/2025/09/14/jim-edgar-obituary-former-illinois-governor-dies-at-79","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/fb46d8f/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5029x3355+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fd1%2Ff6%2F3c423e4ab47007e2cf5caba99489%2Fedgar","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-14 22:01:32","author":"Selena Kuznikov","authors":["Selena Kuznikov"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.015},{"id":360519838,"title":"Biden Aides Launch Brutal Counterattack on Kamala Harris as Former White House Erupts in Bitter Feud","text":"Former aides to Joe Biden have sharply pushed back against former Vice President Kamala Harris after she revealed in her upcoming memoir that she harbored deep doubts about the ex-president's decision to seek reelection, RadarOnline.com can report.In 107 Days, set for release September 23, Harris writes that she felt trapped in an impossible position as Biden weighed his run. \n\nAn excerpt published in The Atlantic gives insight into her inner conflict: “During all those months of growing panic, should I have told Joe to consider not running? Perhaps. Of all the people in the White House, I was in the worst position to make the case that he should drop out. I knew it would come off to him as incredibly self-serving if I advised him not to run. He would see it as naked ambition, perhaps as poisonous disloyalty.”\n\nBut Biden’s former aides are ridiculing her account. One ex-White House official told Axios that Harris was “simply not good at the job.” The official added, “She had basically zero substantive role in any of the administration’s key work streams, and instead would just dive bomb in for stilted photo ops that exposed how out of depth she was.”Harris has argued that the truncated timeline of her 2024 campaign — just 107 days — made success impossible. But another Biden aide dismissed that defense, insisting the blame was hers alone. \n\nThe official said: \"The independent variable there is the vice president, not Biden or his aides.\"\n\nOthers took aim at Harris' suggestion that she lacked sufficient backing from Biden's team. One official countered that multiple staffers had tried to set her up for success.\n\nThe former aide explained: \"There were several officials who really tried to help her thrive. But she and her team did not seize that support and make the most of it. It is all a tragedy.\"Another adviser rejected Harris' claim that her silence on Biden's reelection was rooted in loyalty. \n\nThe official said: \"I'm not sure the very robust defense of not having the courage to speak up in the moment about Biden running is quite as persuasive as she thinks it is.\"\n\nPerhaps the harshest rebuke came from a Biden aide who twisted Harris' own campaign slogan into a cutting prediction about her political future. \"We're not going back,\" the official said when asked about her prospects for 2028.Harris’ memoir is already stirring fierce debate within Democratic circles, reopening old wounds from the tumultuous 2024 race and raising new questions about her ability to mount another presidential run.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris accused former President Joe Biden’s staffers of undermining her.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/joe-biden-aides-brutal-counterattack-kamala-harris-white-house-bitter-feud/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/9xfzd5wep/0x0/joe-biden-aides-brutal-counterattack-kamala-harris-white-house-bitter-feud-1757881371363.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-14 21:45:00","author":"Joshua Wilburn","authors":["Joshua Wilburn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":360493804,"title":"Gen Z men and women divided on having kids, poll finds","text":"Gen Z men and women divided on having kids, poll finds\n\nIE 11 is not supported.
