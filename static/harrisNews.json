In July, the deal was approved by the Trump administration.\n\nIn Jobrani's mind, the axing of Colbert's show is no coincidence.\n\n\"I love Colbert — I get my news from Colbert — he makes the news fun,\" he told ABC News in a Melbourne interview last month, after landing from Los Angeles for the start of his latest Australian tour.\n\nThe tour across six Australian cities ended on Sunday, but Jobrani's been coming to Australia since 2008.\n\nHe says Melbourne, as home of the annual International Comedy Festival, has \"good comedy audiences\".\n\nColbert has vowed to continue speaking \"unvarnished truth to power\" and sharing \"what I really think about Donald Trump\".\n\nJobrani, who also regularly speaks out against Trump in his comedy skits — most commonly against the administration's deportation policies — says he intends to do the same.\n\n\"I thought Trump would maybe send the IRS out to audit them or something, just make their lives hard, because Trump unfortunately does not have a sense of humour, he doesn't know how to take a joke, which is what dictatorships usually are like.\"\n\nThe job of the comedian\n\nSince CBS announced the axing in June, there's been much talk in the US entertainment and media industry about how far the Trump administration might go in censoring free speech.\n\nJobrani has united with some of the biggest names in entertainment and late-night television to show support for Colbert, and to fight for free speech.\n\n\"The job of the comedian is to reveal the emperor has no clothes. I think we need to keep doing that — if we don't, we're going to lose our democracy,\" he said.\n\nJobrani has called on others in comedy and the wider entertainment and media industry to stand their ground.\n\n\"I always say the whole point of America is, I can make fun of the president in America. I couldn't make fun of the president of Iran, that wouldn't work,\" he said.\n\nJobrani's family left Iran for the US in 1978, when he was six years old.\n\nIt was just a year before Iran's Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi fell to Islamist rulers, and his family, like many others at the time, made the decision to flee.\n\nIn our interview, he talks of how growing up as an Iranian in California at that time was a struggle.\n\nBut he says it framed the backdrop to much of his comedy, which focuses on the weird and often hilarious events that occur as a child of immigrants.\n\nWhile his parents hoped the UC Berkeley graduate would become a doctor, lawyer, or engineer, he had other plans.\n\nAnd now he's among several Iranian Americans showcasing Iranian culture on stages around the world, and making audiences laugh with Iranians, instead of at them.\n\nThis was something Jobrani never envisaged back in November 1979 — when 52 Americans were taken hostage in the US Embassy in Tehran and held for 444 days.\n\n\"[Being Iranian] has been a challenge, but it also obviously is giving me plenty of material because I have been able to try and present people from Iran and other people from that part of the world, hopefully in a positive light versus what you see when they show us in the news.\"\n\nA path for Iranian American entertainers\n\nJobrani's career took off in the post 9/11 era.\n\nHe had first toured with other \"brown comedians\", including Ahmed Ahmed, Aron Kader and Sam Tripoli, on a show called the Arabian Nights, which was aimed at showcasing the voice of Muslim/Middle Eastern people a year before 9/11 happened.\n\nBut as they toured under that name, they decided to change the title.\n\nAt that time, then-US president George Bush had called Iran, Iraq, and North Korea an \"Axis of Evil\".\n\nSo the trio settled on \"Axis of Evil Comedy Tour\" as the show's name.\n\nSince then, Jobrani has gained worldwide fame and in many ways paved the way for a new generation of comedians from Iranian backgrounds to make it to the world stage.\n\nOn his Australian tour, Jobrani was joined by another rising star, Iranian African American comedian Tehran Ghasri.\n\n\"Comedy is part of the Iranian heritage,\" Ghasri tells ABC News.\n\nJobrani says when he started out, being a comedian was frowned upon by the Iranian diaspora, including his parents.\n\nHe says he was an anomaly when he first started.\n\n\"Now 20-some-odd years later, there's Tehran and there's Max Amini, and there's Amir K … there's Melissa Shoshahi, and there's Peter the Persian, and there's Omid Djalili — and it really does make me happy to see all of these people in this business now.\n\n\"Once the next generations realise, 'Oh, you can make a living doing other things' or you should live your life doing what makes you happy, they start doing it.\n\n\"It's really something that's just great for our community … because until we're telling the stories, no-one's going to tell our stories the way we want to tell them. They're just going to keep making us the bad guy.\"\n\nComedy can 'humanise'\n\nIn recent years Jobrani's played a prominent role in diaspora activism against the Islamic Republic, particularly in the aftermath of the #Women, Life, Freedom protests spurred by the death in custody of Mahsa Jina Amini.\n\n\"I grew up in America, so I always say that I'm not in Iran, but Iran is in me. I feel an affinity towards the country of Iran. I feel an affinity towards the soccer team when they play,\" he said.\n\nJobrani says the various waves of massive protests inside Iran, the recent Israel–Iran war, and people's suffering under Iran's regime is \"heartbreaking\".\n\nHe points to the forced veiling of women, \"discrimination against women, the discrimination against the LGBTQ community, the discrimination against religious minorities like the Baha'i's and others\" as examples of that.\n\n\"I do feel that I want to support the people of Iran, and I do pray and hope for a day where Iran can become a functioning part of the world.\"\n\nJobrani fears Trump's America is becoming more like Iran's repressive regime.\n\nHe says comedy can be a unifying force and a way to fight rising antisemitism and Islamophobia.\n\n\"I think that there's people out there that are waiting to pounce\" he said.\n\n\"Hate and hatred, it's easier to go that way and I think that comedy can counter that.\n\n\"Like when I do a show, I have people from all backgrounds, all religions in the room, we're laughing together and we're humanising each other. What war does is it dehumanises.\n\n\"You get a room where you have a Palestinian, and you have a Jew, and you have a Muslim — people from different backgrounds and we're laughing together — then people realise, 'Oh, he's human. I'm human.'\"","summary":"Iranian-American comedy veteran Maz Jobrani believes the US president is trying to censor free speech in the United States, and he intends to hit back.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-08-13/iranian-american-comedian-maz-jobrani-jokes-about-donald-trump/105611144","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2a656eaf0516d5e5b075694cdc55543a?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2592&cropW=4608&xPos=0&yPos=240&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 22:58:08","author":"Nassim Khadem","authors":["Nassim Khadem"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.18},{"id":350533580,"title":"Trump’s takeover of blue DC met with praise and rage by fed-up residents","text":"President Donald Trump announced the takeover on Monday, saying he would activate hundreds of troops and take over the Metropolitan Police Department in order to address violent crime. \n\nTrump is also targeting homelessness, with the White House saying homeless people must accept shelter, mental health, or addiction treatment, or face jail time to clean up the city’s streets, both for locals and for tourists visiting the Nation’s capital.\n\nIt’s a lot to take in for a city that voted 90.3% for Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in last fall’s election. By contrast, just 6.5% of D.C. voters, 21,076 people in a city of over 700,000, pulled the lever for Trump.\n\nHowever, the district remains a federally controlled entity. Trump is likely on solid legal ground to make the move thanks to the power granted to him by 77 million voters in other parts of the country.\n\nAs the troops arrived Tuesday, D.C. residents who spoke to the Washington Examiner shared a variety of reactions ranging from support for the president’s actions to horror at the prospect of being sent to a concentration camp.\n\nMelanie Splendora, who has lived in the District since 2011, was glad to hear it.\n\n“I feel safer. It’s terrible here,” Splendora said during an interview near her residence on Thomas Circle, just two blocks from the scene of a fatal shooting that took place Monday night. \n\nSplendora added that she’d witnessed groups of teenagers stealing from a nearby CVS more than once, though she said she herself was not targeted.\n\n“Security doesn’t do anything because they’re in a big group, and then they go cursing and being rude to the people in the stores,” she said. “They think they can do whatever they want because they feel like they’re in control of the situation, and they just run off. No one is going to say something.”\n\nSplendora no longer goes out at night out of fear, and cited comments from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser acknowledging that more law enforcement presence in local neighborhoods may be positive in fighting crime.\n\nBut Splendora is likely in the minority of local opinion.\n\nShashank Bharadwaj, who also lives near Thomas Circle, doesn’t feel the takeover is needed. \n\n“I’m worried about it encroaching on D.C.,” Bharadwaj said while walking his dog. “There’s no reason for their presence. Crime rates are down, so I don’t see any good reason to justify it.”\n\nBharadwaj hopes the deployment is as short as possible and said he does feel safe walking city streets. \n\n“That’s the problem with D.C., right?” said Bharadwaj, who has lived in Washington since 2022. “We don’t really have representation at the federal level, so there’s only so much [the city council] can do. It seems like Trump is allowed to just nationalize or federalize the city and take over the police department.”\n\nNew OPM director takes gentler approach to streamlining the federal bureaucracy\n\nA third D.C. local, Axol Campo, also opposes the move, though in far stronger terms.\n\n“I’m a non-binary person that is a D.C. resident,” Campo said. “I also have a last name that’s not traditionally white, so if I get stopped in the wrong area, I could get sent off to a concentration camp or sent to another country or disappeared.”\n\nCampo, who lives in the northern part of the city, described the deployment as a “complete fascist overreach” and was concerned because, “I don’t know where these Gestapo are going to pop up.”\n\nFor Campo, who has lived in Washington for 10 years, a lack of police on the streets beats the threat of a militarized force, and the plans to remove homeless people from the streets are also a concern.\n\n“I feel safe when there are unhoused people, because where the f*** are they going to go?” Campo said. As for Mayor Bowser, Campo wishes she would be much more aggressive in her interactions with the president and Washington’s police force. \n\n“Stand the f*** up,” Campo said. “She, for years, has been offering bigger bonuses to police, while choosing not to fund things that would actually support the community.”\n\nCampo declined to be photographed, citing safety concerns.","summary":"Washington D.C. residents are preparing for a federal takeover of local law enforcement as National Guard troops made their way to the District Tuesday morning.

Texas’ effort could move up to five U.S. House seats now controlled by Democrats into Republican hands.\n\nTo blunt those possible GOP gains in Texas, Democratic Gov. JB Pritzker has hinted Illinois might try to make his party’s dominance of the state’s 17-member congressional delegation even more lopsided through a new round of redistricting.\n\nHow or if that would happen remains to be seen. But given the way Illinois’ current map was drawn four years ago, eking out another Democratic district could be a tall order. Democrats hold a 14-3 majority in Illinois’ congressional delegation.\n\n“I don’t think anyone’s certain that it is [possible] at this point to add another Democratic district to the current map here,” said Ryan Tolley, executive director of CHANGE Illinois, a nonpartisan, nonprofit group that has pushed for redistricting reform.\n\nDemocrats’ options with downstate districts now held by Republican U.S. Reps. Mary Miller and Mike Bost appear limited. They are generally not near any major, Democratic-rich urban areas, and Trump ran up 40 percentage point advantages in each over Democrat Kamala Harris during last year’s presidential election.\n\nThe third GOP district now occupied by U.S. Rep. Darin LaHood is still decidedly Republican but less one-sided. It skirts Democratic-friendly areas of Rockford, Peoria and Bloomington-Normal, and Trump’s advantage over Harris last year stood at about 23 percentage points.\n\nLast week, Pritzker did not rule out an effort to reconfigure those districts in response to Texas.\n\n“When Republican states are more often gerrymandering than Democratic states are, it seems like all bets are off,” the governor said. “We’ve got to consider all the options when they’re trying to take democracy away.”\n\nThe government reform group, Common Cause, gave Illinois’ last redistricting effort a failing grade, one notch below the D- it gave to Texas. The group faulted the congressional maps put into place by Illinois and six other states “due to egregious partisan and racial gerrymandering.”\n\nStill, Pritzker has accused Trump, in particular, of “cheating” with his open advocacy for Texas redoing its congressional boundaries to safeguard his power in Washington during next year’s midterm elections.\n\n“He knows he’s going to lose the Congress in 2026. That’s why he’s going to his allies and hoping that they can save him. And we’ve all got to stand up against this,” Pritzker said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “This is — it’s cheating. Donald Trump is a cheater. He cheats on his wives. He cheats at golf. And now he’s trying to cheat the American people out of their votes.”\n\nBut the window to do something in Springfield is narrow. Nominating petitions for the March 17, 2026, primary election already are circulating, and candidates begin filing their election paperwork with the state in late October.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Tony McCombie, R-Savanna, told WBEZ she doesn’t think Pritzker has the political power to force it, noting Democratic supermajorities in the Legislature stymied a couple of his past legislative priorities.\n\n“If [Illinois House] Speaker [Emanuel Chris] Welch wants to do it, then it will be done,” she said of a possible redistricting effort.\n\nWelch’s office told WBEZ this week that it’s currently not on the table.\n\n“We have no[t] had any new conversations about new congressional maps in the House,” Welch spokesman Jon Maxson said.\n\nIf Pritzker and Illinois Democrats do answer Texas with a new round of redistricting aimed at Illinois Republicans, Tolley worries about the impact of a political tit-for-tat.\n\n“This fighting fire with fire? We’re just going to end up disenfranchising more and more people,” he said.\n\nAlex Degman is based in Springfield and covers Illinois government and politics for WBEZ.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/springfield/2025/08/12/illinois-redistricting-jb-pritzker-texas-democrats-greg-abbott-remap","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/605ed62/2147483647/strip/false/crop/5187x3458+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F39%2F63%2F02f7ba894cf4a5e200e6a3f098e8%2Felect","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 22:16:37","author":"Alex Degman | Wbez,Dave McKinney | Wbez","authors":["Alex Degman | Wbez","Dave McKinney | Wbez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.508},{"id":350521006,"title":"Brown’s Reported Senate Run Leads to Shift in Ohio Race","text":"After weeks of speculation, former Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, is reportedly entering the race to run next year against Republican Sen. Jon Husted, who was appointed earlier this year to replace now Vice President JD Vance. Crystal Ball’s Larry Sabato already changed the state of the race from “Likely Republican” to “Lean Republican.”\n\nBrown was denied a fourth term when he was defeated by Sen. Bernie Moreno by 3.6 points last November. That flip helped Republicans regain control of the Senate.\n\nThe Plain Dealer/Cleveland.com “spoke with three Ohio labor leaders whom Brown has told directly of his decision to run for Senate, as well as other Ohio Democrats who have heard of Brown’s plans via members of his inner circle.”\n\nThe Daily Signal reached out to Husted’s office for comment on the state of the race given the change from Crystal Ball. \n\nHusted’s political X account has reposted comments in support of his reelection from Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who serves as the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, as well as Sen. Eric Schmitt R-Mo. Both highlighted Brown’s loss from last year.\n\nWhoever wins next year’s U.S. Senate race in Ohio will be up for reelection in 2028, which is when Vance’s freshman term in the Senate would have ended. Moreno is up for reelection in 2030.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee also provided The Daily Signal with a statement: “Chuck Schumer and the Democrats are so desperate they’ve recycled a liberal loser,” said Nick Puglia, the committee’s regional press secretary. “Ohioans just rejected Sherrod Brown and they’ll do it again in 2026.”\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y, reportedly met with Brown to encourage him to run to defeat Husted, with the former senator being seen as Democrats’ best hope. \n\nSenate Leadership Fund Chairman Cory Gardner also released a statement on Thursday. “Sherrod Brown has spent his entire career collecting a government paycheck, and now just eight months into retirement and after a date night with Chuck Schumer, he’s begging taxpayers for more,” said Gardner. “Ohioans firmly rejected Sherrod after he oversaw Biden’s disastrous inflation crisis as Banking Chairman, and they’ll gladly do it again. [The Senate Leadership Fund] stands strongly with Senator Husted and we look forward to seeing him re-elected.”\n\nA press release with Gardner’s statement also referenced examples of “Sherrod Brown’s Radical Record,” citing his positions on illegal immigration, transgender politics, race, and taxes.\n\nAmericans for Prosperity-Ohio likewise shared a statement about Brown’s reported run that focused on his record.\n\nAFP Ohio State Director Donovan O’Neil’s tied Brown to “the Biden/Harris Bidenomics playbook.” President Donald Trump beat former President Joe Biden in Ohio in 2020 and former Vice President Kamala Harris there in 2024, most recently winning the Buckeye State by 11.2 points.\n\nRepublican operative Jai Chabria explained why Crystal Ball changed the race to “Lean Republican,” telling The Daily Signal how Brown is “very capable” and an “institution in Ohio,” though he added that “people have lost faith” in the institution.\n\nChabria also spoke to how “there were tens of millions of dollars spent to define [Brown] as too liberal,” which he says “will continue to stick” and is “a brand [Brown’s] got to spend just to overcome in a state that’s moved red.”\n\nIt’s not merely what Brown has going against him, but what Husted has going for him. Chabria praised the current senator’s campaign as “very capable” and being a “tested campaign,” which he notes “makes it very challenging for Sherrod Brown.”\n\nChabria, a political advisor for Republican gubernatorial candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, also pointed to strength from the “top of the ticket” for 2026 as a plus for Husted.\n\nBrown was first elected as senator in 2006, when he defeated now Republican Gov. Mike DeWine, the incumbent at the time. Brown was comfortably reelected in 2012 and 2018 before Moreno beat him in the “Toss-Up” race. \n\nThe Daily Signal also reached out to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for comment.","summary":"After weeks of speculation, former Sen.

During the Substack conversation, Schmidt praised Moran for describing Miller as such and the former ABC news reporter argued that value judgments were crucial in journalism.\n\n“We must use the language of values in covering the world because the world is made up of that — of right and wrong, of love and hate,” Moran said. “And if you can’t, as a journalist, describe and perceive those values at work, good and evil, then you aren’t really doing your job. You’re collecting a paycheck, and it was a pretty good one, but you aren’t really doing your job.”\n\nMoran also said on “The Bulwark” in June after his firing that journalists do not have a duty to aim for impartiality in their coverage.\n\n“My own feeling is you don’t sacrifice your citizenship as a journalis[t]. And your job is not to be objective,” Moran said. “There is no Mount Olympus of objectivity where a Mandarin class of wise people have no feelings about what happens in their society.”\n\n“We’re all in this together. What you have to be is fair and accurate. And I would refer to the interview with [President Donald Trump] that I did or a lot of my work,” he continued. “And I would also say that this, while very hot, is an observation, a description that is accurate and true.”\n\nHowever, an ABC spokesperson told CNN’s Brian Stelter that Moran’s post blatantly breached ABC News’ policies, specifically noting the outlet mandates “the highest standards of objectivity, fairness and professionalism” for its reporters.\n\nMiller alleged that Moran’s tirade indicated the corporate media consisted of “radicals adopting a journalist’s pose” and that “Terry pulled off his mask.”\n\nMoreover, Moran acknowledged in a July 29 Substack piece that ABC News was a “biased” organization.\n\n“Were we biased? Yes. Almost inadvertently, I’d say,” Moran wrote. “ABC News has the same problem so many leading cultural institutions do in America: A lack of viewpoint diversity.”\n\n“It is no secret. There are hardly any people who supported Donald Trump at ABC News or the other corporate/legacy/mainstream news networks,” he added. “And this is bound to impact coverage, not so much out of malevolent bias … but more out of what is a kind of deafness.”\n\nABC News paid $15 million to settle Trump’s defamation lawsuit against the network in December after “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos falsely asserted in March 2024 that Trump was found liable of rape.\n\nABC News debate moderators Linsey Davis and David Muir also received backlash for fact-checking Trump more frequently than former Vice President Kamala Harris during their sole debate of the 2024 presidential election. Although Harris made multiple misstatements, the moderators did not interrupt her or fact-check her like they did Trump.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Vance Has Found a Remarkable New Way to Seem Like an Entitled Doofus","text":"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nWasn’t it just days ago that news outlets reported that Vice President J.D. Vance had the military raise an Ohio river’s water level to make conditions more optimal for his 41st-birthday kayaking trip? So how is it that he’s already moved on to wreaking havoc on an entirely different locale for a whole separate getaway, this time to England’s Cotswolds, where, a few days ago, his security team allegedly dispatched the police en masse in advance of his arrival? We are 12 days into August, and the Vance travel monster has managed to upend life on two separate continents.\n\nAccording to a dispatch from U.K.’s Observer, this was the scene:\n\n “We have had the police knocking on every door,” said a dog walker and resident of Dean, as a helicopter buzzed overhead. “They wanted the names of everybody living there and details of their social media. I know several people refused. We asked them if they were protecting us, or Vance. At least they were honest and said it is for him and that it will all be passed on to the American security people.”\n\nThe locals apparently found the authorities demanding to know if they’ve posted photos of Vance in the style of a Furby to be “unsettling.” No kidding. (Kamala Harris reportedly visited the area recently as well, but the most noteworthy thing about her stay was that she was spotted at a famous pub.)\n\nA pattern is beginning to emerge here. In his travels this year, the vice president has been known to have places like the Colosseum, as well as the Taj Mahal and Disneyland, closed off to the public while he and his family enjoy a private visit—behavior that may be typical for a foreign leader of his notoriety but will do little to help his officious public image. Nor will raising the water level of a river, something I’m pretty sure I didn’t even know was possible to do until I read about his ordering the Army Corps of Engineers to work their magic on the Little Miami River. Demands like this make him sound like some kind of mad king, no matter what excuses his camp makes about safety concerns. (And, hey, the New York Times noted, Al Gore did this once too!)\n\nAnyway, does Vance really go on all that many vacations? The full rundown of Vance’s other destinations this year—remember, he’s been in office only since January—includes Italy, India, Vermont, Greenland, Disneyland, and Nantucket. Many of those were “official trips,” which politicians from both parties take frequently, reasonably or not. And it’s not unusual for anyone to spend time with their families in August. But as with many things in his life, Vance does seem to have a unique knack for looking like a complete jerk when it’s his turn. The former Ohio senator is already known for many dubious things—he is the guy who mocked “childless cat ladies,” the guy who’s utterly convinced that he has a great sense of humor, and the guy who always looks as if he has eyeliner on, to name a few—but being a guy who has main-character energy in foreign resort towns is some kind of humiliating new low.

Despite all the headlines, I don’t think we have any real hope of making Vance feel shame or humility. But on a purely surface level, next time he books a trip—the Daily Beast says he has his heart set on getting to Hawaii one of these days—maybe he’ll at least think about how this all looks to everybody else.","summary":"He's bringing “American on vacation” energy to heights few thought possible.","url":"https://slate.com/life/2025/08/jd-vance-trump-river-raised-ohio-vacation-meme.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/2493742e-debe-4e17-bf2c-f88601031296.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 21:06:28","author":"Heather Schwedel","authors":["Heather Schwedel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.017},{"id":350513962,"title":"Terry Moran Demands Journalists Take Stand On ‘Good And Evil’ To Do Their ‘Job’","text":"Former ABC News correspondent Terry Moran asserted on a Monday Substack conversation with Lincoln Project co-founder Steve Schmidt that journalists must ascribe “values” to the subjects of their reporting.\n\nABC News fired Moran in June due to his tirade against White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller, whom he alleged was a “world-class hater” in a now-deleted X post. During the Substack conversation, Schmidt praised Moran for describing Miller as such and the former ABC news reporter argued that value judgments were crucial in journalism. (RELATED: ‘It Was Embarrassing’: Sean Spicer Goes Off On Media For ‘Disgusting’ Coverage Of Army Parade)\n\n“We must use the language of values in covering the world because the world is made up of that — of right and wrong, of love and hate,” Moran said. “And if you can’t, as a journalist, describe and perceive those values at work, good and evil, then you aren’t really doing your job. You’re collecting a paycheck, and it was a pretty good one, but you aren’t really doing your job.”\n\nMoran also said on “The Bulwark” in June after his firing that journalists do not have a duty to aim for impartiality in their coverage.\n\n“My own feeling is you don’t sacrifice your citizenship as a journalis[t]. And your job is not to be objective,” Moran said. “There is no Mount Olympus of objectivity where a Mandarin class of wise people have no feelings about what happens in their society.”\n\n“We’re all in this together. What you have to be is fair and accurate. And I would refer to the interview with [President Donald Trump] that I did or a lot of my work,” he continued. “And I would also say that this, while very hot, is an observation, a description that is accurate and true.”\n\nHowever, an ABC spokesperson told CNN’s Brian Stelter that Moran’s post blatantly breached ABC News’ policies, specifically noting the outlet mandates “the highest standards of objectivity, fairness and professionalism” for its reporters.\n\nMiller alleged that Moran’s tirade indicated the corporate media consisted of “radicals adopting a journalist’s pose” and that “Terry pulled off his mask.”\n\nMoreover, Moran acknowledged in a July 29 Substack piece that ABC News was a “biased” organization.\n\n“Were we biased? Yes. Almost inadvertently, I’d say,” Moran wrote. “ABC News has the same problem so many leading cultural institutions do in America: A lack of viewpoint diversity.”\n\n“It is no secret. There are hardly any people who supported Donald Trump at ABC News or the other corporate/legacy/mainstream news networks,” he added. “And this is bound to impact coverage, not so much out of malevolent bias … but more out of what is a kind of deafness.”\n\nABC News paid $15 million to settle Trump’s defamation lawsuit against the network in December after “This Week” host George Stephanopoulos falsely asserted in March 2024 that Trump was found liable of rape.\n\nABC News debate moderators Linsey Davis and David Muir also received backlash for fact-checking Trump more frequently than former Vice President Kamala Harris during their sole debate of the 2024 presidential election. Although Harris made multiple misstatements, the moderators did not interrupt her or fact-check her like they did Trump.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

O’Brien gave a historic address to the Republican National Convention (RNC) in 2024 after President Donald Trump invited him to the event, Breitbart News reported at the time.\n\n“President Trump had the backbone to open the doors to this Republican convention, and that’s unprecedented. No other nominee in the race would’ve invited the Teamsters into this arena. Now you can have whatever opinion you want, but one thing is clear: President Trump is a candidate who is not afraid of hearing from new, loud, and often critical voices,” he said during his speech.\n\nAccording to the Politico article published on Monday, O’Brien is “signaling a more permanent realignment” in the form of donations going to Republicans:\n\nFor the second year in a row, the labor union’s political arm donated to the Republicans’ House campaign arm after nearly two decades of mostly backing Democrats. The labor union’s D.R.I.V.E political action committee — Democrat, Republican, Independent Voter Education — gave the National Republican Congressional Committee $5,000 in the second quarter.\nIn addition to giving to the NRCC, Teamsters doled out a combined $62,000 in contributions to nearly two-dozen GOP congressional candidates, including in significant battleground districts.\n\nA Teamsters spokesperson told the outlet its members are “working people whose interests cut across party lines.

Brown, who began his career as a state representative in the 1970s, won U.S. Senate races in 2006, 2012 and 2018 prior to losing to sitting Republican Senator Bernie Moreno last fall by more than 200,000 votes.The very slim Democratic field affords Brown the opportunity to face off against Republican Senator Jon Husted, Ohio's former lieutenant governor and secretary of state, who was appointed by Republican Governor Mike DeWine to fill the vacant U.S. Senate seat opened by JD Vance becoming vice president.Newsweek reached out to Brown and Husted via email for comment.What To KnowBrown has told Democratic allies and labor leaders of his decision, according to sources including Cleveland.com, CNN and Politico.The ex-senator, who lost to Moreno by a 50.1-46.5 percent margin, had not publicly commented on his campaign at press time.Polling on a hypothetical Brown-Husted matchup remains slim, with the Democracy and Public Policy Network at Bowling Green State University (BGSU) and YouGov conducted in February and April showing Husted leading by 6 and 3 percentage points, respectively.The polls each had roughly a 4 percentage point margin of error, according to Real Clear Politics.Robert Alexander, a professor of political science and founding director of the Democracy and Public Policy Network at BGSU, told Newsweek that Brown's reemergence in Ohio politics is \"huge news.\"\"There were a lot of kinds of inside baseball Ohio folks thinking he was going to run for the governor's position, and would probably have a better shot at running for governor,\" Alexander said. \"I think a lot of Democrats are concerned that [Republican Vivek] Ramaswamy will take the state even further into Trump-y territory.\"As for Husted, Alexander said that even with his many years of being a public official in different major statewide offices, \"there's a lot of Ohioans that don't know who he is.\" Also, a candidate's first Senate run is also the most vulnerable.\"Sherrod Brown does have a good name in the state,\" Alexander added. \"He lost against a relative newcomer in Bernie Moreno. Headwinds were against him. Kamala Harris did not fare very well; he certainly overperformed against Harris, so in a midterm election, he's able to change those fortunes a little bit.\"So, I think the risk among the Democrats is worth the reward. It's gonna say, look, this could put us in contention to win back the Senate even if he won the governorship, you know, Republicans. he risk in in outweigh the reward in running for Senate as opposed to the governor's position.What People Are SayingSenate Leadership Fund Chairman Cory Gardner, in a statement: \"Sherrod Brown has spent his entire career collecting a government paycheck, and now just eight months into retirement and after a date night with Chuck Schumer, he's begging taxpayers for more. Ohioans firmly rejected Sherrod after he oversaw Biden's disastrous inflation crisis as Banking Chairman, and they'll gladly do it again. SLF stands strongly with Senator Husted and we look forward to seeing him re-elected.\"What Happens NextOhio's special Senate election will be held in November 2026 to determine the seat holder for the remainder of Vance's final two years of his last term, which expires in 2029.Whoever wins next year will likely run for a full six-year term in 2028.","summary":"One pollster told Newsweek that Brown's reemergence in Ohio politics is \"huge news.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/sherrod-brown-jon-husted-ohio-senate-election-2112454","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2701235/sherrod-brown.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=b801739106bb27e911f9347fa8dfd71f","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 19:50:04","author":"Nick Mordowanec","authors":["Nick Mordowanec"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.114},{"id":350508566,"title":"Late Night Host Jimmy Kimmel Gets Italian Citizenship, Says US Under Trump ‘Worse Than...’ | N18G","text":"Last Updated:August 13, 2025, 01:17 IST Videos\n\nLate-night host Jimmy Kimmel has revealed that he obtained Italian citizenship this year, partly as an exit option amid growing concerns about President Donald Trump’s administration.

'I'm aligning with the gun-carrying, cowboy conservative, prepper Arizona population, which I always thought were rednecked and religiously fervent, you know?'\n\nSimilarly, Dalton - who is in her 70s - says the center of her political belief is the opposition to 'corruption'.\n\nShe allegedly supported Trump and Elon Musk's efforts to reshape federal bureaucracy under the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nShe made several sarcastic Facebook posts criticizing Democrats and championing several DOGE initiatives, including cutting funding to the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).\n\nIt is somewhat unsurprising that many Sedona mystics are Trump supporters, given that most of Arizona favored the president in the last election.\n\nTrump successfully flipped the state of Arizona last November, sweeping all seven swing states in the 2024 presidential election. \n\nHe captured 52.6 percent of votes in Arizona, compared to Kamala Harris' 46.4 percent. The state had previously been won by Joe Biden in the 2020 election.\n\nSedona is also situated in relatively conservative Yavapai County, which has voted Republican in every presidential election since 2000.","summary":"The so-called new age Sedona hippies are openly supporting Donald Trump at their shops and meditation centers amid a statewide shift towards conservative politics","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14993845/arizona-city-love-trump-shun-untrustworthy-democrats.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/12/19/101153363-0-image-m-15_1755023979872.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 19:32:54","author":"Editor,Natasha Anderson","authors":["Editor","Natasha Anderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":350488954,"title":"Why did Jimmy Kimmel take Italian Citizenship?

My own one-man U Street patrol last night, however, came too late to find any action at all, though I traversed that same 15th Street corner. Even U Street, apparently, is quiet on Monday midnights. I flagged down one cop in a passing patrol car and asked if there were National Guard or other agents out there. She told me if there were, I wouldn’t see them; they’d be “blending into the walls.” Which meant no Guards, but maybe plainclothes FBI, whom perhaps I had mistaken for the handful of guys sitting on bus benches waiting disconsolately for the 12:20 to Anacostia. An FBI agent dragooned into midnight outdoor duty on a steamy D.C. August night wouldn’t have to work hard to look disconsolate.\n\nSo far, Trump’s takeover of the D.C. cops and militarization of the city is conceptually both outrageous and dangerous, while in actuality, a good share of it is still blending into the walls. The number of uniformed Guardsmen who’ll be deployed at any one time is supposed to number 200, clustered around prominent intersections and providing some kind of ill-defined support for the police. They have no power to make arrests, while roving FBI and ICE agents do have that power. What that means is that, as was definitely not the case in Los Angeles in June, Trump’s legions will not be assembled en masse or storming places of work to make mass arrests. Their deployment is a wholesale outrage on a retail scale.\n\nAs was absolutely the case in Los Angeles, Trump sends in the troops in hopes of provoking a backlash in a city he knows hates his guts, which he uses to justify further deployments and a drift toward martial law. D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser all but openly said yesterday that that was her primary fear. The way to protest, she told D.C. residents, was to revive the cause of D.C. statehood in Congress (though that would require a Democratic majority in the House and a 60-vote supermajority in the Senate). What “would be a disaster,” she said, would be “if people who aren’t committing crimes are antagonized into committing crimes. That would be a disaster.”\n\nAntagonized into committing crimes. Her fear is Trump’s hope; it would pave the road to the militarization of civil life. Unlike L.A., as of now there won’t be the massive deployment of Guards that brought thousands of demonstrators to confront them, nor will individual arrests here have the same effect that the ICE raids have had on California. Also unlike L.A., of course, D.C. is the site of the White House, where there are sure to be angry demonstrations. Trump doubtless hopes they’ll turn violent, opening the door to a more violent repression. The cops and the feds will surely stage shows of force at busy nightlife centers when they’re busy (if I’d gone up 18th Street instead of along U Street last night, I’d have seen them), but whether those assemblies will become flashpoints is as much, if not more, up to the cops and their new federal helpers than it will be to any protesters.\n\nD.C.’s police union reacted to Trump’s takeover with unconcealed glee; like many cop unions, it gives voice to those officers who see themselves as occupying hostile territory and being held back from sufficiently forceful action. The union, in an official statement it released yesterday, said it “acknowledges and supports the President’s announcement this morning to assume temporary control of the MPD in response to the escalating crime crisis in Washington, DC. The Union agrees that crime is spiraling out of control, and immediate action is necessary to restore public safety.”\n\nIn actuality, the rate of crime in D.C. is spiraling downward, in 2024 to its lowest point in the past 30 years, and lower still in the first half of 2025. D.C. residents clearly remain concerned about crime. A Washington Post poll from May showed that 50 percent of D.C. residents believed the problem of local crime was “extremely” or “very” serious, while 41 percent termed it “moderately” serious. Blacks and lower-class residents were more concerned than other D.C. residents; 65 percent of Black women considered it extremely or very serious—though that was down from 82 percent in the previous year. These numbers echo numerous other polls from across the nation showing that concern over crime is markedly higher among working-class residents than it is among more affluent Americans, and validate pollster Stan Greenberg’s argument that crime suppression has to be part of any Democratic outreach to working-class voters.\n\nTrump’s offensive also includes the breaking up of homeless encampments, with their residents sent to shelters or, if they refuse to go, then to jails. Giving voice to his larger desire to make poor people invisible, he remarked yesterday, “We’re getting rid of slums, too.” This shouldn’t be interpreted as his desire to build affordable housing; I suspect it’s more like his wish for a class-based ethnic cleansing of D.C.’s struggling lower-class Black community. That struggling should be no mystery. As American cities go, D.C. is at the top of the list for metro areas that offer almost no opportunities for remunerative blue-collar work or manual labor. It’s pre-eminently an office city with an office culture, which comes with a side of low-wage jobs in retail, hospitality, and other services. Outside of construction, opportunities for blue-collar men are few and far between—a growing national problem of which the nation’s capital is at the cutting edge. Rather than grapple with this problem, Trump’s default solution appears to run the micro-gamut from banishment to imprisonment.\n\nDespite the falling rate of D.C. crime, the District is low-hanging fruit for a federal takeover. The D.C. home-rule law explicitly permits the president to take over the police force if he deems the city to be in an emergency and gives him unchecked authority to deploy the National Guard in those circumstances as well. The federalization can only last for 30 days, however, unless Congress votes to extend it. That would require 60 votes in the Senate, and its Democratic members aren’t going to let that total reach 60, though Trump would like to provoke so much protest that he can hammer the Democrats for being soft on crime. Then again, he’ll hammer the Democrats for being soft on crime even if there are no protests, which there doubtless will be and doubtless should be.\n\nTrump knows that the vast majority of residents in America’s metropolises are dead set against his policies and hold him in contempt. (In the 2024 presidential election, Kamala Harris got 90.3 percent of the D.C. vote; Trump got 6.5.) What we saw in Los Angeles and are now seeing in D.C. is his way of punishing them for opposing him, as well as his attempt to agglomerate more power for himself over his opponents. These are the most dangerous displays yet of his authoritarian impulses and agendas.\n\nJust as the presence of troops in L.A. provoked protests, so Trump is hoping that the quality of his now enhanced D.C. policing will provoke protests even if the quantity of newly deployed troops and agents isn’t in itself up to the task. In his press conference yesterday, he all but ordered the cops to run amok. Currently, he said, “they’re not allowed to do anything. But now they are allowed to do whatever the hell they want.”","summary":"Today on TAP: In federalizing the D.C. police, Trump seeks some state-sponsored violence.","url":"https://prospect.org/blogs-and-newsletters/tap/2025-08-12-trump-federalizing-washington-dc-police/","image":"https://prospect.org/downloads/23363/download/Meyerson%20on%20Tap%20081225.jpg?cb=90a94a650293e54b0800cead6691d365&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 19:00:00","author":"Harold Meyerson","authors":["Harold Meyerson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.342},{"id":350512156,"title":"Kamala Harris slammed by Teamsters boss for alienating union","text":"to top close Video This video is playing in picture-in-picture.\n\nOn Air August 12, 2025 07:27 \n\n Kamala Harris slammed by Teamsters boss for alienating union \n ‘The Big Money Show’ panelists weigh in on Teamsters latest move to pour money into the Republican Party.\n\nTags WHAT TO WATCHSHOWSUNIONSPOLITICSMONEY AND POLICYECONOMY","summary":"‘The Big Money Show’ panelists weigh in on Teamsters latest move to pour money into the Republican Party.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6376839423112","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/854081161001/350ff008-917c-43b2-bf5f-bca6a6a7f089/2c0399a3-ac9a-4684-bfc6-b4ceacc00afa/1280x720/match/1024/512/image.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 18:47:51","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.181},{"id":350501500,"title":"Laura Loomer Takes X-Rated Jab at Kamala Harris in Newly Unsealed Court Testimony From Bill Maher Defamation Fight","text":"Far-right provocateur Laura Loomer took an X-rated swipe at Kamala Harris in newly unsealed testimony from her ongoing defamation battle with comedian Bill Maher, a comment Puck reported on but deemed too inappropriate to publish, RadarOnline.com can reveal.\n\nThe testimony stems from Loomer’s lawsuit over Maher’s on-air joke saying she had slept with Donald Trump, which she claims damaged her reputation and cost her a White House job.Loomer testified about her connections inside Trumpworld, her repeated visits to Mar-a-Lago, and her past incendiary remarks, including one about Harris' anatomy, Maher's legal team confronted her with in court.\n\nAccording to reports, the testimony revealed Loomer was no stranger to lobbing crude personal attacks at political rivals.Loomer's Deposition Over Maher's Trump JokeMaher’s attorney, Kate Bolger of Davis Wright Tremaine, grilled Loomer about some of her most inflammatory remarks, including her graphic dig at Harris’ anatomy.\n\nThe deposition exchange appeared designed to undermine Loomer's claim that Maher's joke caused meaningful reputational harm by pointing out her history of slinging sexual innuendos.The X-rated jab wasn't Loomer's only swipe at the former vice president. \n\nIn October 2024, on her Rumble show Loomer Unleashed, the 32-year-old accused Harris of \"rolling out more of her fake accents\" in an attempt to connect with Black voters. \n\n\"I mean, she might as well just start talking about fried chicken and watermelon because her policies and her outreach to Black Americans is, is very offensive,\" Loomer said at the time, according to Media Matters. \"I’m not Black, obviously.

JB Pritzker compared President Donald Trump federalizing Washington, D.C.'s police department and sending in the National Guard to moves made by the Nazis. \n\nDuring Trump's announcement Monday morning, the Republican president signaled he could make similar moves in other cities, including Chicago, which set Pritzker off. \n\nPritzker, 60, charged that Trump 'doesn't follow the law.' \n\n'I have talked about the fact that the Nazis in Germany in the '30s tore down a constitutional republic in just 53 days,' Pritzker said.\n\n'It does not take much, frankly, and we have a president who seems hell-bent on doing just that,' the Democrat added, according to the Chicago Tribune.\n\nThe comments came a day after Pritzker signaled that he was open to a 2028 presidential bid - something that Trump mocked during his raucous briefing. \n\n'And now I understand he wants to be president,' Trump said. 'But I noticed he lost a little weight, so maybe he has a chance, you know? You never know what happen,' the president teased before adding, 'But Pritzker's a gross incompetent guy.' \n\nIn a social media post, Pritzker sarcastically wrote, 'Donald, thanks for the compliment!'\n\n'Let's not lie to the public, you and I both know you have no authority to take over Chicago,' he continued. 'By the way, where are the Epstein files?' \n\nA handful of other possible 2028 Democratic hopefuls were quick to criticize Trump too - though they didn't take it quite as far. \n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom, who objected to Trump deploying U.S. Marines and the National Guard to Los Angeles earlier this year to quell anti-Immigration and Customs Enforcement protests, noted that the president 'was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles.' \n\n'He will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America,' Newsom said. 'This is what dictators do.' \n\nMaryland Gov. Wes Moore, whose state is adjacent to Washington, D.C., said in an official statement that Trump's announcement 'lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous.'\n\nHe claimed Trump was 'simply using honorable men and women as pawns to distract us from his policies.'\n\nNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, a failed 2020 White House candidate, took to X to claim that 'Trump doesn't care about the rule of law, and he doesn't care about D.C.' \n\n'This insulting stunt and abuse of power is all a distraction from his corruption and incompetence,' the New Jersey Democrat said. \n\nFormer Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who also ran an unsuccessful 2020 presidential bid, said the D.C. announcement amounted to a distraction and more. \n\n'The president is doing this not in order to make the city safer - that's the job of local law enforcement - but to solve his own political problems,' Buttigieg said. 'I hesitate to use a word like \"distraction,\" even though distraction is part of the goal, because it is legitimately important thing that he is taking power in this way.' \n\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro didn't chime in because he was distracted. \n\nOn Monday a steel mill outside of Pittsburgh exploded killing two workers and hurting others. \n\nOther notable 2028 wannabes, including former Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer didn't immediately comment on the issue.","summary":"Democratic Illinois Gov.

O’Donnell, a frequent Trump critic, recently told Variety she had no plans to return to the US anytime soon, citing concerns for her child’s safety and the political climate.\nKimmel regularly targets Trump in his late-night monologues, which has led to Trump publicly threatening the cancellation of Jimmy Kimmel Live. Trump claimed it would be the next show to go after CBS cancelled Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show. Responding on air, Kimmel said: “I’m hearing you’re next.

Fortunately, the economy is sooo good that we’ve blown through Powell and the complacent Board. I am, though, considering allowing a major lawsuit against Powell to proceed because of the horrible, and grossly incompetent, job he has done in managing the construction of the Fed Buildings,” the president said.\n\nHe added that the construction project “should have been a $50 Million Dollar fix up.”\n\nIt’s unclear what the lawsuit’s claims would be. Powell’s press office did not immediately respond to a Post request for comment.\n\nThe president slammed Powell shortly after the monthly release of inflation data for July, with the Consumer Price Index showing a 2.7% annual increase in prices — remaining above the Fed’s 2% target but well below a 9.1% peak under former President Joe Biden in June 2022.\n\nPowell has refused to lower interest rates at all in 2025 — with Trump alleging political motivations after three cuts last year, including two reductions shortly before the presidential election. During that race, Vice President Kamala Harris faced criticism for her role in the incumbent administration’s economic program.\n\nPowell has justified the unchanged rates by citing the unknown effect of Trump’s tariffs on inflation.\n\nThe Fed’s next meeting to discuss possible rate cuts is scheduled for Sept. 16.\n\nHigh interest rates have made it more expensive to finance home purchases and for businesses and consumers to take out loans, including to lease cars and reduce credit-card balances.\n\nTrump and his team recently appeared to back away from allegations that Powell may have broken the law over the government building renovations, which could have provided a potential justification for termination.\n\nCongressional Republicans had suggested that Powell lied to a Senate committee — a crime punishable by five years in prison — by testifying that the building lacked various luxury features, insisting that plans had changed.\n\nTrump’s budget chief, Russ Vought, then wrote to Powell last month pointing out an apparent Catch-22: that he may have violated the National Capital Planning Act by making unapproved changes to plans.\n\nPowell replied that he considered the changes minor enough that disclosure was not required.\n\nTrump, a billionaire real-estate developer, said he had no plans to fire Powell after touring the site on July 24 — attributing cost overruns to wasteful decisions including to retroactively build basements and parking spots beneath historic buildings just north of the National Mall.\n\nTrump has said he wants Powell to resign but that if he won’t do so, he plans to empower a replacement when his term expires in May 2026 who will immediately move to lower interest rates by more than 2%.","summary":"Trump said that his next line of attack against \"loser'' Jerome Powell for refusing to lower interest rates could be a lawsuit over his $2.5 billion HQ renovation.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/08/12/us-news/trump-threatens-to-sue-loser-fed-chair-jerome-powell/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/trump-jerome-powell-federal-reserve-threat-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/FKHu11CL-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-12 16:37:05","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.311},{"id":350464268,"title":"CNN panel knocks national Democrats on 'tone-deaf' response to Trump DC crime plan","text":"A CNN panel suggested on Monday that the Democratic Party's overall response to President Donald Trump's plan to reduce crime in Washington, D.C., might come across as tone-deaf, likening it to the Democratic Party's messaging on the economy during the Biden administration. \"What’s striking is that national Democrats are not following Mayor Bowser‘s lead on this, and that national Democrats have been insisting, ‘Just look at the statistics, we have a 30-year low in violent crime.’ Whereas Mayor Bowser is talking about, ‘Hey, we need to get 500 more police officers on the streets. We'd like the federal government to help us rebuild our jail,’\" Axios reporter Alex Thompson said during a discussion on \"The Arena with Kasie Hunt.\" \"She's also talking about some of the reforms she did to make it so accused violent offenders don‘t get out of jail pretrial. So there is this disconnect, and I’ve talked to Democrat strategists today that think that national Democrats saying, ‘look at the statistics,’ is sort of a tone-deaf way to react,\" Thompson continued.

TRUMP IS THREATENING TO 'FEDERALIZE' DC WITH NATIONAL GUARD AND MORE.

Look at the statistics. We promise you the economy is great, while people are going, ‘It doesn't feel great to me.’ That feels like a lot of this conversation around crime that you can point to statistics all day long that say, ‘Hey, D.C. is safer this year than it was last year,’ but do people feel safe?\" she observed. \"Bottom line, if they don't, they may be more okay with something that would otherwise be considered extraordinary,\" Anderson said.

Sherrod Brown has reportedly decided to mount a comeback campaign for the Senate after losing by roughly 200,000 votes during his failed 2024 reelection bid.\n\nBrown’s decision, first reported by a local Cleveland-based outlet, capped off months of intrigue about whether the former three-term senator would enter the race against Republican Ohio Sen. Jon Husted or run for Ohio governor in the 2026 midterms. Though Brown is likely to face an uphill battle to unseat Husted, Democrats view the former senator as their best recruit to enter the race and help Democrats retake Senate control during the midterms — and force Republicans to divert significant financial resources to the Ohio contest. (RELATED: Dem Senator’s Campaign Spent Thousands On Fine Dining And Ritzy Hotels, Including Martha’s Vineyard Stay)\n\nRepublican Ohio Sen. Bernie Moreno ousted Brown from his Senate seat last November by roughly four percentage points in the most expensive Senate race of the 2024 presidential cycle — with more than $440 million in spending — according to AdImpact. Moreno’s victory made Ohio one of four states in which Republicans flipped Senate seats on their way to retaking control of the upper chamber in 2024.\n\nBrown’s forthcoming challenge against Husted is similarly expected to be one of the most expensive races of the midterms.\n\nHe has consolidated Republican support with an early endorsement from President Donald Trump and Republican Ohio Governor Mike DeWine and is growing a war chest with roughly $2.65 million in the bank.\n\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee, Senate Republicans’ campaign arm, is projecting confidence that Brown’s comeback bid will end in defeat. The NRSC released a memo Tuesday detailing the challenges a Brown comeback candidacy will face, including the state’s continued shift to the right over the past decade and Husted’s high statewide name recognition and track record of never losing a statewide election before.\n\n“Ohio has experienced an electoral transformation thanks to President Trump, as evidenced by Sherrod Brown’s failed reelection in 2024,” the memorandum, first reported by Punchbowl News, states. “We will defeat him by an even wider margin the second time around with a proven winner in Senator Husted.”\n\n“As Ohio reddens and conservative momentum grows, Sherrod Brown’s waning legacy will be that of a two-time loser – and Husted is well positioned to defeat him again,” the memorandum continues.\n\nTrump decisively carried Ohio in all three of the presidential elections where he was the Republican nominee. In 2024, he received 55% of the state’s vote to Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ 44%.\n\nSome Democrats appealed to Brown to enter Ohio’s gubernatorial race to take on Republican candidate Vivek Ramaswamy instead of running for the Senate. However, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer traveled to Ohio in July to personally lobby Brown to make another run for the upper chamber, Axios first reported.\n\nA spokesperson for Brown did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

President Donald Trump carried it by double digits last November.Democrats must win at least two Senate races in double-digit Trump states to win back control of the Senate. Maine, which backed former Vice President Kamala Harris by seven points, and North Carolina, which voted for Trump by only three points, are viewed as Democrats' top targets.However, no other Harris or single-digit Trump states are up for grabs, so they are looking at races in states like Alaska, Iowa, Ohio and Texas as potential opportunities.The outcome of the GOP primary between Cornyn and Paxton could have key implications for how competitive the race is. Cornyn leads Allred, a former congressman, by a more comfortable margin in polling than Paxton. But Paxton is favored by many of the state's more conservative voters and has built an early primary polling lead.What To KnowThe Senate Leadership Fund (SLF), the GOP's principal Senate super PAC, urged donors to invest in Paxton during the primary to avoid a more expensive general election, according to a presentation obtained and reported by Punchbowl News.Helping Cornyn win the GOP nomination would cost up to $70 million, but it could cost up to $250 million to help Paxton win the general election, according to the report. The presentation also included a slide showing Cornyn leading Allred by about six points, while Paxton trails by about one point.A poll from YouGov and Texas Southern University, which surveyed 1,200 registered voters from May 9 to May 19, 2025, showed Cornyn led Allred by four percentage points (48 percent to 44 percent), while Paxton led by only two points (48 percent to 46 percent).It had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.Meanwhile, a survey conducted by GOP pollster Brad Parscale showed Paxton trailing Allred in a hypothetical matchup. It found that 52 percent of voters would likely vote for Allred, while 37 percent would vote for Paxton. It surveyed 1,000 likely voters in mid-April.Mark Jones, fellow in political science at the Baker Institute and political science professor at Rice University, told Newsweek that while Paxton would still likely be favored in a general election because Texas remains reliably red, he would be more vulnerable than Cornyn due to having a \"considerable amount of political, ethical and legal baggage.\"A \"perfect storm\" for Democrats could brew if Paxton becomes the nominee, the economy struggles, and Trump's approval rating continues to dwindle, Jones said.The overall national environment could be a critical question in determining how competitive the race becomes, he said.\"If it's a good election year for Republicans, say like 2024 or even 2022, then even Paxton should be able to win under that scenario,\" Jones said. \"I think the fear that Republicans have is, what if 2026 is more like 2018 than 2024. If it's like 2018, when they were within three points of defeating [Texas Senator] Ted Cruz, that's where having a flawed candidate like Ken Paxton could be a real liability.\"The latest polls also show Paxton leading Cornyn in the primary.A University of Tyler poll, which surveyed 538 registered voters from May 28 to June 7, showed Paxton leading by about 10 points (44 percent to 34 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points.The YouGov/Texas Southern University survey also showed Paxton leading by about nine points (43 percent to 34 percent).Cornyn, for his part, is already doing two things he should do to win back support in the primary by working to boost his image among GOP primary voters, while also using resources to tarnish Paxton's image, Jones said.Despite these polls, winning Texas would be a major uphill challenge for Allred or another Democrat. Texas has not voted Democratic on the presidential level since 1976, and has not voted for a Democratic senator since 1988. The state last elected a Democratic governor in 1990.Trump won Texas by more than 13 points last November, performing stronger in suburban areas while also making inroads in Southern Texas, a heavily Hispanic area that shifted rightward.Allred, however, lost by a smaller 8.5 margin against Cruz.Trump has declined to endorse in the race so far.What People Are SayingSenator John Cornyn's campaign senior adviser, Matt Mackowiak, told Newsweek: \"It would be political malpractice for the GOP to have to invest $200+ million to hold a safe Senate seat if Crooked Ken Paxton is the nominee. John Cornyn hasn't been on the ballot in five years. Educating voters about his actual record is job #1 — especially his 99.2% record voting with Trump while President. All public polling shows Cornyn's image with Republican voters is solid and it will continue to grow as voters learn about his actual record. We have a plan to win this race and we are executing it.\"President Donald Trump told reporters in April: \"I like Paxton, I like Cornyn, they're both good people. So, I'll make a decision somewhere along the line. But you have two very good men.\"Colin Allred, on July 1 in a post to X: \"Washington is broken and the system is rigged – and Texas families are paying the price. Today I'm announcing I'm running for the U.S. Senate because Texans deserve someone who will fight for them. From working to lower costs to taking on corruption, I'm ready to be the fighter Texans deserve.\"What Happens NextThe Cook Political Report classifies the race as Likely Republican, meaning it is \"not considered competitive at this point\" but has \"the potential to become engaged.\" Sabato's Crystal Ball also lists the Texas Senate race as Likely Republican.The primary will be held on March 3, 2026.","summary":"Cornyn's senior adviser said it would be \"political malpractice\" for the GOP to have to invest more than $100 million in the race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/texas-senate-polls-gop-john-cornyn-2112310","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2701020/senator-john-cornyn.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=f8af780f899cbd02ceb1aec44e3146f1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 15:48:22","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":350430932,"title":"Jon Batiste Supports Stephen Colbert amid “Late Show” Cancellation: 'His Voice Won't Be Silenced'","text":"Jon Batiste is standing by his former colleague Stephen Colbert.\n\n In an interview with Rolling Stone AU/NZ on Monday, Aug. 11, Batiste, who was the bandleader and musical director of The Late Show from 2015 to 2022, defended the late-night host, 61, after it was announced last month that The Late Show will end after 10 seasons.\n\n “What happened to my friend Stephen is a symptom of big money,” the composer, 38, said.\n\n Batiste added: \"We’re in a time where the right price can silence the voice of free speech, which we should be very, very conscious of.

Entre los asistentes se encontraban figuras destacadas de la política local, desde el alcalde Todd Gloria hasta la supervisora Paloma Aguirre y la sheriff Kelly Martinez.\n\n“A medida que profundizamos nuestras raíces aquí en San Diego, un lugar que me formó como soy, me emociona compartir lo que viene para esta campaña”, dijo Atkins a la multitud de simpatizantes. “No es solo una sede de campaña, es el corazón de un movimiento”.\n\nEn las últimas semanas, dos importantes cambios han afectado la ya apretada contienda por el máximo cargo del estado.\n\nEl mes pasado, Harris se negó a participar en la contienda, eliminando a una contendiente de gran éxito cuyo reconocimiento era mucho mayor que el de cualquier rival.\n\nY justo el viernes, la vicegobernadora Eleni Kounalakis se retiró de la contienda, reduciendo aún más las posibilidades. Kounalakis ha anunciado que ahora planea postularse para tesorera estatal.\n\nEstos acontecimientos han abierto un amplio abanico de demócratas que compiten por una ventaja de cara a las primarias del próximo junio.\n\n“Creo que la experiencia importa”, declaró Atkins en una entrevista, destacando su experiencia como presidenta de la Asamblea estatal y presidenta pro tempore del Senado estatal.\n\n“He representado a esta zona durante casi 30 años de una forma u otra”, afirmó. “Las relaciones son profundas, así que pretendo que esto sea mi base”.\n\nFuncionaria electa durante décadas, Atkins ha consolidado el apoyo a su candidatura en el área de San Diego y ahora busca expandirlo por toda California en los próximos meses. Para dar a conocer su candidatura y conocer a votantes en otras partes del estado, Atkins emprenderá una gira estatal a finales de este mes, desde Red Bluff, en el norte de California, hasta Riverside.\n\n“Esta vez no es solo la persona más calificada”, dijo el representante federal Scott Peters sobre Atkins. “Es la persona más calificada en mucho tiempo”.\n\nEl punto clave de la candidatura de Atkins, señaló Peters, era cómo dar a conocer a alguien que ya ha estado al frente del gobierno estatal durante tanto tiempo.\n\n“El desafío es que ha estado bastante callada”, dijo sobre el tiempo de Atkins en la política. “Solo tenemos que difundirlo”.\n\n¿Dónde están las encuestas y el dinero?\n\nLas encuestas a estas alturas de la contienda han sido dispersas. Pero con la salida oficial de Harris, la posición de la contienda se ha vuelto más evidente.\n\nLa exrepresentante federal Katie Porter ha experimentado el mayor aumento desde que Harris se retiró de la carrera por la gobernación, con un apoyo del 18% este mes, en comparación con el 12% de abril, según una encuesta reciente de Emerson College. Sin embargo, Porter ha sufrido una derrota recientemente a nivel estatal, quedando en tercer lugar en la contienda por el Senado de EE. UU. del año pasado.\n\nEn el evento del sábado, Peters lanzó una indirecta abierta a su excolega en la delegación estatal del Congreso, conocida por mostrar pizarras blancas durante las audiencias de los comités para ilustrar sus argumentos.\n\n“La gente puede ser muy elocuente con sus pizarras blancas”, dijo Peters. “Se puede hacer un espectáculo en televisión. Pero esto es una entrevista de trabajo, ¿de acuerdo?”.\n\nAun así, la encuesta de Emerson muestra que un alto porcentaje de votantes se mantiene al margen: un 38% indeciso y un 5% con otra preferencia.\n\nOtros demócratas en la contienda tienen porcentajes de apoyo de un solo dígito, como el exsecretario de Salud y Servicios Humanos de EE. UU., Xavier Becerra, el multimillonario Rick Caruso y el exalcalde de Los Ángeles, Antonio Villaraigosa.\n\nAtkins se encuentra entre ellos, con aproximadamente un 2% de apoyo, según la encuesta.\n\nEntre los republicanos, el presentador de Fox News, Steve Hilton, cuenta con un 12% de apoyo, en comparación con el 7% de apoyo para el sheriff del condado de Riverside, Chad Bianco.\n\nEn cuanto a la recaudación de fondos, Atkins es la persona demócrata con mayor efectivo disponible.\n\nSegún la información financiera de la campaña, Atkins cuenta con 4,3 millones de dólares en sus arcas. Villaraigosa es la segunda con mayor cantidad, con 3,4 millones, mientras que Porter tiene 2 millones y Becerra 2,1 millones, según la información.\n\nOriginal Story","summary":"El sábado, Atkins realizó su primera demostración de fuerza en la carrera por la gobernación, con sus partidarios abarrotando una nueva sede de campaña en Mission Hills.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/08/12/tras-el-anuncio-de-harris-la-candidatura-de-toni-atkins-de-san-diego-por-la-gobernacion-de-california-toma-fuerza/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/SUT-L-Toni-Atkins-001.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 14:40:03","author":"Lucas Robinson","authors":["Lucas Robinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":1},{"id":350444520,"title":"'It can happen here': Critics slam Pentagon proposal to put troops in US cities","text":"The Washington Post reports the administration of President Donald Trump is evaluating a Pentagon proposal to establish a “Domestic Civil Disturbance Quick Reaction Force” for rapid deployment into American cities in the event of protests, which are protected by the U.S. Constitution.\n\nSocial media blasted the plan to set aside 600 troops to be on standby at all times for deployment. \n\n“They told me if I voted for Kamala Harris we would have martial law.

They were wrong.\n\nThey believed millions of Americans wouldn't put up with another four years of Trump. They couldn’t have been more wrong.\n\nInstead, they suffered an enormous body blow as Harris was swept across all seven swing states on the way to a wipeout loss in what was supposed to be one of the closest elections in history.\n\nThe GOP also maintained control of the House and Senate, leaving the shell-shocked party leaders looking at each other dumbfounded and asking: What now?\n\nThe desperate race is on to find the new leader who, in 2028, stands a chance against the candidate picked to carry MAGA into a future beyond its king.\n\nThe whispers have already started as candidates quietly make moves behind the scenes, laying the groundwork for a presidential run.\n\nBut, if the latest DailyMail+ Power List is anything to go by, the Democrats are in serious trouble if they are considering looking at one of their own for the answer.\n\nBased on exclusive polling, our Power List captures public sentiment around likeability, trustworthiness, perceived bias and knowledge.\n\nThe data reveals who Americans like and trust and who they don't, and the verdict is as damning as it is surprising.\n\nWe polled 29 high-profile figures: 22 popular faces with direct ties to the party and seven others who have been floated as candidates.\n\nThe result reads less like a political power list and more like a Hollywood guest list, and it has insiders painting an ominous picture of a party in crisis.\n\nThe first elected Democrat doesn't appear until sixth place, and he isn't the youthful figure needed for the future.\n\nThe results pose an existential question: Do they need an outsider like Trump to take back the White House in just over three years?\n\nThe ranking shows that voters have turned their backs on Washington and are instead looking to A-list stars and wildcards.\n\nThe findings show the American public has serious trust and relatability issues with the Democrats in power.\n\nThe poll's most likeable, truthful and fun figure is… Tom Hanks.\n\nThe 58-year-old Hollywood icon was also voted the most knowledgeable, the least bias, and the most likely to tell the truth.\n\nThe Toy Story and Forrest Gump star won every Power List category except for one: Who voters would most like to spend time with.\n\nA lifelong Democrat, he has campaigned for liberal candidates for decades, famously joking when he endorsed Barack Obama in 2008: 'As an official celebrity, I know my endorsement has just made your mind up for you.'\n\nIn an interview with BBC ahead of the 2016 election, he called Trump a 'self-involved gas bag.'\n\nBut every time fans have begged him to throw his hat into the presidential election ring, he hasn't been persuaded.\n\nAnd then there's Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, who voters said they most like to spend time with.\n\nHe came a close second to Hanks in every other category.\n\nThe former wrestler has teased a political run for years — telling fans in 2021: 'I don't think our founding fathers EVER envisioned a six-four, bald, tattooed, half-Black, half-Samoan, tequila drinking, pickup truck driving, fanny pack-wearing guy joining their club – but if it ever happens, it'd be my honor to serve you.'\n\nThe 53-year-old actor even admitted in November 2023 that he was approached by both parties after a poll suggested 46 percent of Americans would support his candidacy.\n\nJohnson is followed by George Clooney.\n\nThe actor's scathing New York Times op-ed calling for Biden to step aside was seen by many insiders as the tipping point that forced the then-81-year-old president to end his re-election bid.\n\nBillionaire businessman Mark Cuban and talk show mogul Oprah Winfrey, both staunch supporters of Harris during her 2024 campaign, complete the top five.\n\nThey were both part of the cadre of stars who appeared alongside the vice president during her doomed bid.\n\nTo critics, filling the stage with celebrities helped paint the picture that Democrats were out of touch with most of the population.\n\nYet Cuban and Winfrey's names have both been mentioned in the past as wildcard presidential candidates. \n\nA report in October 2023 revealed that Winfrey considered running for president and even pitched the idea to potential running mate, Utah's Republican Senator Mitt Romney.\n\nBut on 60 Minutes in 2016 she appeared to rule out any White House prospects by admitting: 'It's not in my DNA'.\n\nThe first elected Democrat on the list is Bernie Sanders, the 83-year-old Vermont senator who has spent decades railing against the political establishment.\n\nSanders ranks as the most knowledgeable politician on the list and one of the most truthful, but his advancing age and socialist brand hardly scream fresh leadership.\n\nPennsylvania's hoodie-wearing Senator John Fetterman and New Jersey's Cory Booker scrape into contention.\n\nFetterman, 55, has denied claims he has flirted with switching to the Republicans and has infuriated many in his party with his moderate stances, especially in his support of Israel.\n\nSenator Booker, 56, unsuccessfully ran for president in 2020. \n\nOn April 1, he shot back into the headlines and into contention with his record-breaking 25-hour Senate floor speech attacking Trump’s policies.\n\nBut the rest of the party's elected leaders struggle, only breaking the top five in two categories: Whether they are a good hang or biased.\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Gretchen Whitmer - two candidates widely considered to have presidential aspirations - come in 10th and 11th respectively.\n\nGovernor of Maryland Wes Moore, the rising Democrat star who has been compared to Barack Obama, comes in 12th and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshar comes in 13th.\n\nFormer Vice President Harris and California Governor Gavin Newsom, two California power players in the 2028 mix, could only manage 16th and 17th place.\n\nNeither has formally announced a run. Haris has ruled out a bid for Governor of California, clearing the way for another shot at the White House.\n\nNewsom has laid the groundwork with a slew of recent podcast appearances and an increase in attacks on what he perceives as Donald Trump's abuse of power.\n\nThe results were bleak reading for voters who believe the progressive wing of the party could carve a path to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nFirebrand Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s name has been floated as a prospect.\n\nYet the New York Democratic Rep. finished 24th out of 29, one spot above Biden.\n\nHer fellow members of 'The Squad', representing the members on the far left of the party, didn't fare any better.\n\nRep. Ilhan Omar finished dead last, two below firebrand Michigan Rep. Rashida Tliab.\n\nThe results have sent Democratic operatives into a panic about the future. 'At this stage in the cycle, name ID is everything,' admitted John McCarthy, President Biden's former senior political adviser. \n\n'Democrats have a talented bench, but the next generation of leaders is still largely unknown. Our nominee probably won't be Tom Hanks — but the fact voters know him better than most of our electeds says it all.'\n\nDemocratic strategist Meghan Hays' assessment was more blunt: 'Many people hold celebrities in a more favorable view right now because they're not the ones in power. \n\n'Some use their platforms to push back on Trump's policies, while many Democrats feel frustrated by the lack of visible action from elected officials.'\n\nAndrew Bates, former Biden spokesperson, frames it as a broader credibility crisis: 'This is a moment of cultural skepticism towards those who've been in power. Democrats who prove they're listening about costs and have a genuine hunger to fight for working people will climb.'\n\nBut in key Democratic cities, the mood is grimmer still.\n\n'They are solid politicians, but none of these folks speak to all Democrats,' said Malcolm Weems, a Chicago-based operative.\n\n'Some Black voters here don't feel like the national party talks to them at all. The list looks like it could have been pulled from five years ago.\n\n'These are safe bets for risk-averse donors — not the future of the party.'\n\nRodell Mollineau, partner at ROKK Solutions, summed it up: 'There are a lot of angry and despondent Democratic voters right now. They're looking for the energy that meets the moment.'\n\nLast month, DailyMail+ launched the Power List by revealing the best-loved (and most loathed) morning-show hosts and news media stars.\n\nWe also ranked the sports analysts who divide the opinion of millions of fans across the country and revealed the nation's most beloved NFL quarterback.\n\nOur standings of the leading figures in Trump's inner circle revealed who holds the most influence.\n\nIn the weeks ahead, we'll bring you our power list rankings for more figures in the world of media, US politics, fashion and sport.","summary":"The desperate race is on to find the new leader who, in 2028, stands a chance against the candidate picked to carry MAGA into a future beyond its king.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14929199/Democrats-Daily-Mail-Power-List-ranking-2028.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/08/12/13/101114527-0-image-a-23_1755001566723.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-12 14:21:37","author":"Editor,Elina Shirazi,Harriet Alexander,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Elina Shirazi","Harriet Alexander","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":350414836,"title":"JD Vance claims Kamala Harris snubbed White House olive branch gesture","text":"JD Vance claims Kamala Harris snubbed a White House olive branch tradition, saying she \"rebuffed\" his family's request to see their new living quarters in January.\n\nThe nicety has become a recent norm in American politics, where the outgoing vice president shows the incoming VP’s family where they'll be living on the grounds of the Naval Observatory in north west Washington.\n\nMr Vance said he had to instead show his children old diagrams, photos, and books of the house, which U.S. President Donald Trump calls \"nicer than The White House\".","summary":"JD Vance claims Kamala Harris snubbed a White House olive branch tradition, saying she \"rebuffed\" his family's request to see their new living quarters in January.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/tv/news/jd-vance-kamala-harris-white-house-video-b2806025.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/11/10/59/JD-Vance-wants-Elon-Musk-back-in-White-House-but-says-Tesla-boss-wont-take-his-calls.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/YJvbXWRL-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-08-12 14:07:49","author":"Luke Reevey","authors":["Luke Reevey"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.168},{"id":350426102,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Claws Are Out!

Colin Allred and Sen. Ted Cruz and Allred breaking fundraising records, Democrats dared to dream once again of a Blue Texas.\n\nBut like every statewide race since 1994, Democrats’ dreams were just that — dreams. And Election Day 2024 was more of a nightmare. Allred lost by over 8 percentage points as a Trump wave swept both Texas and the nation.\n\nBut the 2026 Senate race has given Democrats a new spectre of hope. Like 2018, when then-Rep. Beto O’Rouke came within three points of victory, Democrats are the party out of power and Trump is in office. The prospect of facing embattled Attorney General Ken Paxton, who is challenging Sen. John Cornyn and leading in the polls, is even more enticing. A Republican poll from May found Allred beating Paxton by one point; another found Paxton losing to a generic Democrat.\n\nFresh off a loss, Allred is trying to convince Democratic voters that he’s still the best option.\n\nAllred, who flipped a Republican-held House seat in 2018 and spent three terms in Congress, announced his repeat bid in late June, with a new campaign message focused on opposing corruption. And he has pledged to bring a new energy to this race. “Last time they got the Congressman; this time they’re getting the linebacker” has been a common refrain in his pitch to voters.\n\nTo that end, Allred, a former NFL player and civil rights attorney, has appeared at rallies and town halls across the state and has posted frequent direct-to-camera short videos criticizing Republicans — including from the gym.\n\nTexas Democrats are contending with paradoxical conclusions about Allred’s prior campaign as he works to convince voters he has learned the right lessons.\n\nOn the one hand, Allred received more votes than any Democrat in Texas history — over 5 million — save for Joe Biden in 2020. In a year where Republicans dominated, he outran Vice President Kamala Harris by nearly 6 percentage points. And he overperformed her with key groups and in key regions, winning heavily-Latino counties along the border that Harris lost and edging out Cruz in swingy Tarrant and Williamson counties even as Trump won them.\n\nBut some Democrats believe his 2024 campaign was too bland in a state where Democrats would need enormous turnout among left-leaning voters for a reasonable chance at victory. Often stuck in Washington due to House votes instead of out on the road, Allred relied on heavy TV spending to introduce himself statewide and improve his name recognition, touting his bipartisan bona fides. He frequently noted that he was endorsed by both labor (the AFL-CIO) and business (the Chamber of Commerce) in his House races. It was a much more conventional campaign than O’Rourke’s in 2018, where he barnstormed every county in the state and routinely had viral moments.\n\nNow away from Congress, Allred said he plans to run an “entirely different” campaign. To that end, he has traveled around the state as part of Texas Majority PAC’s Turn Texas Blue tour, hosting rallies in the big metropolitan areas and in smaller corners of the state.\n\n“I think in the past, I've probably been known as maybe more moderate,” he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune. “I've told people I'm just as angry as they are about what's going on. In this campaign, I do think one of the things I want to do is take this conversation directly to Texans and have it with them all over the state.“\n\nWith Texas in the national news cycle over Republicans’ plans to conduct mid-cycle redistricting, Allred has also launched an “Unrig Texas” series of town halls to discuss redistricting around the state in August, starting in Denton.\n\nWhile Allred has echoed other Democrats’ calls to “fight fire with fire” on redistricting, he said he sees a hunger among Texans at his events for good governance — and has spoken often about the need for a national ban on gerrymandering.\n\n“I was telling them not that we should gerrymander in return,” Allred said of a rally he hosted in early August in Missouri City. “I was saying, we should ban this. And I think people — that’s what they also agreed with.”\n\nBut as Democrats clamor for fighters, others in the party — including state Rep. James Talarico, a potential primary opponent — have generated more attention than Allred with their more forceful remarks. Talarico, who has done dozens of interviews from Illinois where he is part of a quorum break, has, like Allred, discussed the need for an end to gerrymandering writ large. But he’s also said he hopes Democrats in blue states redraw maps if Texas’ do pass and encouraged other Democrats to learn “how to have a backbone” from he and his colleagues in Texas.\n\n“If one side cheats, then all bets are off,” Talarico told Medhi Hasan.\n\nO’Rourke is even more blunt. “Fuck the rules!” he told a crowd in New Orleans. “We’re going to win, whatever it takes.”\n\nThose differences in rhetorical style could matter if it comes to a primary. Chuck Rocha, a Democratic strategist with a decades-long history in Texas, said all Democrats in Texas need to improve their appeals to middle-class voters, especially in how they talk to them. While he praised Allred for his performance in the Rio Grande Valley, he said his 2024 campaign was too buttoned-up and cautioned him — and the consultant class — against making that mistake twice.\n\n“You have to let the candidate be their authentic self, not a caricature from a thesis book in your political science class of what they're supposed to be,” Rocha said.\n\nAllred’s strategy\n\nAllred said his main focus this go-around would be to “show, not tell” voters that he cares about them. He has leaned into messaging that emphasizes his working-class background — raised by a single mom in Dallas, Allred said he wants to connect with voters on their affordability concerns above all else.\n\n“My mom and I struggled growing up, and she was a public school teacher who never had enough money to go around,” he said. “We always, going to the grocery store, were counting what we could afford that week. I know that feeling very well, and I want to speak more to that in this campaign.”\n\nAllred also believes a tighter focus on the economy can help Democrats lure back Latino voters in Texas, whom both Trump and Cruz won in 2024 according to exit polls, though the latter by a smaller margin.\n\nPost-2024, Democrats across the country — but especially in Texas — have done plenty of soul-searching about their struggles with Latino voters, including diagnosing why Trump appealed to them, particularly in South Texas. Allred has his own theory.\n\n“I think they were promised in the last election that the candidates they voted for were going to [lower costs], but they have done the opposite,” he said, referencing Republicans’ passage of a mega-bill that is projected to raise energy costs and Trump’s tariff policy. “It's going to be a very expensive Christmas for working people, and I think that's what we have to speak more to, both for Hispanic and Latino voters, but also just for Texas in general.”\n\nAllred said he wants to be more accessible to voters across the state. Through his rallies and town halls, he has already been spending more time on the road in Texas, from Abilene to Houston to McAllen.\n\nThe Democratic political class — including his critics — have noticed.\n\n“He's a much better speaker — I noticed that immediately,” said a Democratic operative who works on races in Texas and thought Allred’s team was overly cautious in 2024. “He's significantly more energetic in his presentation. I think what he's saying is much more interesting.”\n\nHe sees particular opportunity in improving urban turnout. Voter turnout was lower in 2024 than in 2020, particularly in the state’s urban centers. In Texas’ four big blue counties — Harris, Bexar, Dallas and Travis — turnout was about 50% in 2024, compared to over 60%in 2020.\n\nDemocrats always face an uphill battle of convincing their voters to turn out in a reliably red state, but Allred hopes to connect with urban voters through showing up more often.\n\n“They're working harder for less, and then an election comes up, and it's almost secondary,” Allred said. “I want to speak to that, but also [make sure] they know my story, that I understand what they're going through, that I have plans that I know that we can put in place to lower their costs from health care to child care to housing.”\n\nHe’s funneling much of his message through the lens of corruption, between the economy and redistricting, calling both rigged systems that reward the wealthy. Though Allred has routinely attached both “Paxton and Cornyn” in his anti-corruption appeals, Paxton, who has faced ethical and legal troubles, would be an easier target.\n\nA competitive primary?\n\nBefore Allred announced his re-election, he met with Talarico, O’Rourke and San Antonio Rep. Joaquin Castro to discuss their 2026 ambitions. All interested in the Senate, the hope was that they could find a way to efficiently use all of their talents.\n\nBut Allred announced a campaign shortly after, and with the Senate a far more attractive option than taking on Gov. Greg Abbott or other state-level positions, none of the other two have announced a national move yet. Talarico has openly pondered a Senate bid, including inquiring with stations about ad rates.\n\nAllred said the four have not had any further coordination, though he has had some informal conversations.\n\nThe Senate logjam is a corollary of Texas Democrats’ statewide failures. Governors, senior senators or other statewide elected officials are often unofficial statewide party leaders, who can solve disputes before they reach the level of a primary. But with no obvious party leader in Texas, no one has the clout to issue top-down directives, including which statewide races to assign their most talented candidates.\n\nMatt Angle, a longtime Texas Democratic operative and director of the Lone Star Project, said Allred brings a lot of proven ability to the race and was a victim of Democrats’ national collapse last cycle.\n\n“He's not somebody who's a fresh face or somebody who's going to spout curse words every tenth word,” Angle said. “But he's somebody who has proven that he can beat a Republican. He's somebody that's proven that he can get money. He's somebody that's proven that he can run ahead of a national ticket by three or four percentage points.”\n\nBut Angle also said that Talarico, who has an enormous online presence and has become the face of the quorum break among national media, brings a vibrancy that voters like.\n\n“Democrats like candidates that make their pulse race,” he said. “James Talarico is an extraordinarily talented and very capable guy. If he runs for Senate, he'll be a serious candidate.”\n\nRelative to Talarico, Allred also comes to the race with higher name recognition — having just run statewide — and a serious fundraising operation that brought in over $80 million last cycle.\n\nBut not all consultants were as bullish on Allred.\n\nThe Democratic operative who works on races in Texas said Allred was encouraged to lay low too often in 2024. The operative has been encouraged by Allred’s travel schedule and messaging thus far, but worried that he is not generating enough attention for voters to notice.\n\n“He's done a good job so far this cycle showing that there are other sides to him, but no one's seeing them,” the operative said. “The press isn't super excited to cover him, and then the voters sort of think of him as this guy who was just sort of calm and works on both sides of the aisle — quiet. It's hard to get a second chance sometimes.”\n\nAnother Democratic consultant in the state said that progressives are not enthused about Allred. The operative said Allred was late to the redistricting news cycle — he did not testify at any of the Legislature’s field hearings until the map was released and he spoke in Austin — and is too scripted in his overall presentation.\n\n“People want to see a fighter,” the operative said. “You just can't be seen otherwise as middle of the road…I think that whole middle thing just does not play as well in this midterm.”\n\nShape the future of Texas at the 15th annual Texas Tribune Festival, happening Nov. 13–15 in downtown Austin!

But is Dana White’s Trump bond a liability?","text":"Forget for a moment the stereotype that MMA athletes and their fans are All-American bar fighters. The MMA community is far more diverse and far more cerebral than the casual onlooker realizes.\n\nHas Dana White forgotten that?\n\nThe UFC president has long sought to expand the sport’s appeal to as many demographics as possible. But in the past few years, he has bet big on a tight affiliation with Donald Trump, who has been perfectly content to revel in the adulation of one segment of the population while heaping scorn upon all others. White has campaigned for Trump, welcomed him to several UFC events and hasn’t immediately smacked down the notion of holding a UFC card at the White House.\n\nOn the surface, that might seem logical. MMA culture is intertwined with bro culture, and bros are considered the antithesis of “woke” liberalism.\n\nBut it’s not that simple. Consider a startling fact: while Maga champions an “America First” ideology, the UFC is a paragon of globalism. Of the 11 reigning UFC champions, only one is American – Kayla Harrison, thriving in an organization White once insisted would exclude women. Both Australia and Georgia (the country) boast twice as many champions as the UFC’s home country. The only belt firmly held by US fighters is the unofficial ‘BMF’ (Baddest Motherfucker) belt. White invented this to reward charismatic fighters who put on great shows. While it’s a clever way to encourage personality and panache, it also seems like a DEI program to ensure US fighters remain prominent in the UFC pantheon.\n\nSo the UFC roster is more global than ever. But UFC fighters have never fit neatly into categories.\n\nThis diversity was a hallmark of the reality show that broke the UFC into the mainstream, The Ultimate Fighter. The casts included cerebral chess players, devout Christians and someone who brought a compass to ensure that his bed would face north, and another who fled the show to reassure his girlfriend that rumors she saw online weren’t true.\n\nAnd the UFC evolved in ways that might be considered “progressive.” Cain Velasquez didn’t lose any noticeable fan support in 2010 when he sported a “Brown Pride” tattoo across his chest and admitted that his father had immigrated illegally. (Velasquez has since been sentenced to prison for issues unrelated to immigration.) After opposing the idea of female fighters for many years, White threw open the Octagon door to Ronda Rousey in a 2013 bout against Liz Carmouche, who was openly gay. White strongly supported Carmouche and even gave an impassioned plea to legalize gay marriage wherever it wasn’t already recognized – a position he stated well before a series of landmark US supreme court decisions upheld that right. Four years later, UFC fighter Jessica Andrade proposed to her girlfriend in her postfight interview in the Octagon. While the UFC sold Pride Month gear and gave proceeds to an LGBTQIA+ organization in Nevada, outspoken Trump supporter Colby Covington emerged as one of the sport’s biggest villains.\n\nStill, the UFC’s primary demographic of young adult men proved to be a decisive force for Trump’s return to the presidency. This group overlaps significantly with the audience for UFC commentator Joe Rogan’s popular podcast, and Rogan – who felt ostracized by the left after touting scientifically unsound Covid treatments – endorsed Trump last year.\n\nBut that was November. Fast forward to this summer, and this demographic has veered sharply against Trump. Rogan himself has broken with the president over tariffs, deportations and the Epstein files. Last month, Rogan told podcast guest James Talarico, a Texas Democrat, that he should run for the White House. There’s a case to be made that if the Kamala Harris campaign had managed to get her on Rogan’s podcast last fall, we would have a different president today.\n\nSuch changes shouldn’t be a surprise. Rogan himself is always on the lookout for new ideas – if anything, he’s a little too receptive to some schools of thought and doesn’t push back or check facts. While older Americans are prone to adopting a party and sticking with it come hell or high water, Gen Z is fiercely independent politically. They’re also more diverse than previous generations, more likely to be non-white, LGBTQ+ or any other group that may feel aggrieved by Trump’s actions since reclaiming the presidency. Younger generations are also much more receptive to socialism than prior ones – after all, young men made enough of a fuss over Bernie Sanders to warrant the term “Bernie Bros.”\n So Maga’s place in “bro culture” – and those who are MMA fans – is by no means secure. And one day, Donald Trump will be out of office. We’ve already seen that US conservatives are eager to abandon one trend for another. Today’s Maga supporters had a decidedly different message when the Tea Party reigned supreme. Two decades after calling Democrats “traitors” for opposing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, they excommunicated the entire Bush family.\n Trump’s popularity may well be on the slide too. His approval rating has tanked, and his mutable responses to the Jeffrey Epstein saga have fractured his base. The UFC may well be losing as many fans as its attracts by aligning itself with Trump.\n\nThe UFC, meanwhile, is still a strong brand but perhaps not the hot property it was a few years ago. Last week’s Disney earnings report made a brief reference to “lower Ultimate Fighting Championship pay-per-view fees due to lower average buys per event.” The fight game tends to be cyclical, driven by big personalities like Rousey, Jon Jones and Conor McGregor, all of whom have either left the sport or gone through a prolonged period of inactivity. It’s tough to imagine current light heavyweight champion Magomed Ankalaev reaching the level of fame of Forrest Griffin, Rampage Jackson or Chuck Liddell. While we can’t really quantify the impact of the Trump lovefest on the UFC’s popularity, the organization clearly can’t afford to alienate the 60% or so of the population that disapproves of Trump’s presidency thus far.\n\nPerhaps this is one reason why the UFC has just opted for a new media deal that breaks from their pay-per-view model in order to get wider exposure. “This shift in distribution strategy will unlock greater accessibility and discoverability for sports fans,” said the press release announcing the seven-year, $7.7bn deal. Some fight cards will be on network TV, and others will be free to subscribers of their streaming partner.\n\nThat streaming partner, though, is Paramount, which has also drawn the ire of many US viewers through a series of moves that appear to be a capitulation to the president’s desire to control the media. First, Paramount settled a lawsuit over the editing of a Kamala Harris interview, a lawsuit deemed by many legal scholars as rather simple for Paramount to win, at the same time that the media conglomerate sought government approval for a merger. Second, after TV host Stephen Colbert criticized his parent company for settling the suit, Paramount announced that his show will end in 2026, ostensibly for financial reasons even though it is the highest-rated late-night show. (Fox News Channel claims its show Gutfeld! has higher ratings, but it airs earlier than the traditional late-night window that starts at 11.30pm Eastern time.)\n\nStill, the decision to move away from the pay-per-view model can only be seen as a sign that the UFC feels the need to make its big tent a bit bigger as it faces the difficult challenge of keeping US fans interested in a sport in which American athletes are far from dominant. Typically, US sports broadcasters gravitate to events in which US athletes are faring well, which is why Olympic coverage focuses far more attention on swimming and snowboarding than, say, table tennis or biathlon.\n\nWhite and Trump were always an odd match. Trump was involved with Affliction, a rival MMA organization of the late 2000s that White fought with the venom of the Trump administration’s attacks on Harvard and the media. Trump has ridiculed veterans, dating back to when he said he didn’t consider John McCain a war hero because he likes “people who weren’t captured’ and continuing with Ice arrests of veterans in his second term and a recent awkward moment in which he turned attention to himself at a ceremony honoring Purple Heart recipients; White and the UFC are staunch supporters of the Wounded Warrior Project and other veterans’ groups. White is an affable philanthropist; Trump used funds from his own foundation on a portrait of himself and his presidential campaign.\n\nWe probably won’t see White publicly repudiate Trump, a move that wouldn’t sit well with a sizable portion of UFC’s audience. But over the years, White has shrewdly expanded the UFC fanbase, and he would dearly love for his sport to be the biggest in the world. White has already pronounced that his involvement with politics ends with Trump, telling The New Yorker last year that: “I’m never fucking doing this again. I want nothing to do with this shit. It’s gross. It’s disgusting. I want nothing to do with politics.”\n\nWhite has changed his mind about many things over the years. He brought in Kimbo Slice not long after denigrating his fighting skills. He brought women into the cage. But those moves were driven by popular uprisings, and White is almost always willing to give fans what they want. While much of the country watches in horror as Medicaid is slashed, Gaza’s suffering gets worse by the week, the economy teeters on the brink, and the White House is in crisis mode trying to deflect from the Epstein case, the clamor to make White reassert his position at Trump’s side will surely be muted.","summary":"The Octagon is more international than ever – so why is Dana White still tied to an administration that seeks to isolate large parts of its audience?\n\nForget for a moment the stereotype that MMA athletes and their fans are All-American bar fighters.

Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) said. “Donald Trump has no basis to take over the local police department. And zero credibility on the issue of law and order. Get lost.”\n\nThe takeover of the DC police, which is expected to last 30 days, was met with outrage from leading Democratic lawmakers, including Govs. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), JB Pritzker (D-IL), and Wes Moore (D-MD), all potential 2028 presidential candidates.\n\n“He was just getting warmed up in Los Angeles,” Newsom wrote on social media following Trump’s Monday press conference, referencing the president’s use of National Guard assets earlier this year to quell protests and riots surrounding Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in the Los Angeles Area. “He will gaslight his way into militarizing any city he wants in America. This is what dictators do.”\n\n“Let’s not lie to the public, you and I both know you have no authority to take over Chicago,” Pritzker added in his statement. “By the way, where are the Epstein files?”\n\nMoore said, “Trump’s decision to mobilize the National Guard to conduct municipal policing in D.C. lacks seriousness and is deeply dangerous.”\n\nThe Democratic Mayors Association cited statistics showing that “crime is down in most major cities — including Washington, D.C.” to claim that Trump “only wants to create another political charade to serve his own interests and distract Americans from his failures.”\n\nSenior Republican operatives with close ties to the Trump White House told the Washington Examiner that Newsom, Pritzker, and other presidential hopefuls “predictably” fell into Trump’s political trap, one that pits them on the “losing side” of the issue.\n\n“There’s no denying that Washington is an absolute cesspool — wannabe teenage gangsters, weed smoke everywhere. President Trump is doing what any reasonable person would hope, making this city safe and liveable,” one former Trump administration official said. “And instead of saying, ‘thank you, Mr. President, for cleaning up our streets,’ the Democrats are coming out as pro-crime. It’s the perfect play.”\n\n“I certainly hope so,” a veteran operative with past work on Trump’s political campaigns laughed when asked if Trump’s move could put Democrats at a disadvantage ahead of next year’s elections. \n\nTrump has employed similar tactics in the past, albeit with mixed results. Throughout the 2020 campaign, which he eventually lost, the president repeatedly sought to paint former President Joe Biden and Democrats as soft on crime by linking them to the Black Lives Matter protests and national police reform movements. \n\nThat tactic proved much more successful during the 2024 election. However, as Trump was able to spin Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’s border policies into electoral gold, he specifically sought to tie immigration to crime on Monday morning.\n\n“We’re not going to take it just like we did on our southern border,” he said during his press conference. “Nobody comes to our southern border anymore.”\n\nTrump’s intervention happened after a string of high-profile crimes in DC, including the murder of two Israeli Embassy staffers, Yaron Lischinsky and Sarah Milgrim, the attack of Edward Coristine, a former Department of Government Efficiency engineer who goes by the nickname “Big Balls,” and the shooting death of 21-year-old congressional intern Eric Tarpinian-Jachym.\n\nTamara Tarpinian-Jachym, Eric’s mother, said she doesn’t care that statistics show DC crime may be declining when far too many people are getting hurt.\n\n“I looked at Eric’s ashes, and I said, Eric, you haven’t died in vain,” Tarpinian-Jachym told Fox News in praising Trump’s announcement. “Things will change so other people are safe when they go visit DC or work at DC. And that’s my goal, to make people safe.”\n\nEven the DC Police Union issued a statement on Monday welcoming Trump’s takeover announcement. Chairman Gregg Pemberton said his union stands “with the president in recognizing that Washington, DC, cannot continue on this trajectory.” \n\n“Crime is out of control, and our officers are stretched beyond their limits,” Pemberton wrote. “The federal intervention is a critical stopgap, but the MPD needs proper staffing and support to thrive. This can only happen by repealing the disastrous policies that have driven out our best officers and hindered recruitment.”\n\n“This is why Democrats continue to be so unpopular among everyday Americans — they think the President of the United States cracking down on crime in our nation’s capital is a bad thing,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers added in a statement when asked if Trump’s announcement is meant to put political pressure on the opposing party.\n\nHowever, Trump’s polling remains negative, with the RealClearPolitics average showing his approval rating sitting six points underwater as of Monday. Furthermore, only 4% of respondents to an Economist-YouGov tracking poll last week ranked crime as the most important issue to them, with inflation and prices (21%), jobs and the economy (14%), and healthcare (11%) all significantly outranking crime.\n\nAnd not all Democrats took Trump’s Monday bait.\n\nWashington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser framed Trump’s announcement as an opportunity to supplement their existing police initiatives.\n\n“I can’t say that given some of the rhetoric of the past, that we’re totally surprised,” she told reporters. “I can say to D.C. residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.”\n\nThough Bowser did call Trump’s moves “unprecedented,” she also repeatedly declined to tell reporters that she would resist the federal takeover in any form or fashion, despite protests breaking out in the city demanding a “Free DC.“\n\n“If people are concerned about the president being able to move the National Guard into our city, the time to do that would have been when Congress had a bill that it could have given control of the D.C. National Guard to D.C.,” the mayor continued.\n\nA Democratic National Committee spokesman declined to comment on whether Trump’s D.C. takeover would put political pressure on Democrats regarding crime, instead citing chairman Ken Martin’s statement from earlier in the day.\n\n“Donald Trump’s record as president is marked by gross abuses of power, and his latest move to supersede local law enforcement by deploying the National Guard to Washington, D.C. is no exception,” Martin wrote. \n\nDemocratic strategist Mike Nellis downplayed questions regarding whether Trump has potentially put pressure on Democrats concerning crime.\n\n“Federalizing the D.C. police is another wild swing from the president as his approval rating continues to crater,” Nellis told the Washington Examiner. “His decision-making is driven by erratic attempts to change the subject.”\n\nNellis, who worked for former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2020 Democratic primary campaign during which she was pressured regarding crime, added: “Polls show him underwater on every major issue, including immigration. Most Americans don’t care about what happens in DC — they want action on the economy, and most say they’re worse off than before Trump took office.”\n\nA second Democratic strategist, Christopher Hahn, agreed, “This is the standard GOP playbook being taken to another level.” \n\n“Now that he’s involved, he owns all of it,” Hahn told the Washington Examiner regarding Trump. “And we all know how powerful a single crime can be in political ads.”","summary":"President Donald Trump is painting Democrats as soft on crime ahead of the 2026 midterm elections as he seizes control of law enforcement in Washington, D.C., and accuses liberals of presiding over a public safety crisis.

Get your fat a***s over at a Cracker Barrel because nobody wants to see your f****ng smug a**, teeny weeny pink arm, big gut around.\n'Nobody wants to see that s**t, no one.'\nFans quickly slammed the 'pompous and arrogant' interior designer - with one writing: 'It’s always the most intolerant and hateful pretending to love everyone.'\nOthers wrote: 'Yes listen to this elite rich white woman. \n'What a pompous, arrogant thing to say.\n'Uber Karen. I voted for Trump and I’m having a burrito with chorizo and spinach dip for lunch today.\n'I know a lot of black, Hispanic and Indian people who voted Trump three times as well.'\n\nAppearing on her I've Had It podcast, Welch ranted: ' I’ve had it with white people that triple Trumped that have the nerve and the audacity to walk into a Mexican restaurant, a Chinese restaurant, an Indian restaurant, go to a gay hairdresser'\n\nWelch - who formerly starred on short-lived reality show, Sweet Home, Oklahoma - ranted: 'Get your fat a***s out of the Mexican restaurant. Get your fat a***s over at a Cracker Barrel because nobody wants to see your f****ng smug a**'\nBack in April Welch had a tense debate with former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel when he joined I've Had It to discuss the problems within the Democratic Party.\nEmanuel previously served as Chicago's mayor from 2011 to 2019, was an adviser to President Bill Clinton, served as President Barack Obama's chief of staff and was an ambassador to Japan under President Joe Biden. \nThe two Democrats struggled to find a consensus on transgender rights and their conversation quickly morphed into a tense debate, hinting at a divide that may cause trouble in 2028. \n\n Woke female podcaster's meltdown appears to spell doom for Dems' future election chances \nWelch, a more progressive member of the left, laid into Emanuel during their conversation when he accused Kamala Harris of not prioritizing economic issues, noting that Democrats weren't 'really good about the family room issues.' \n'The only room we were doing really well was the bathroom, and that’s the smallest room in the house,' he continued, referencing the ongoing debate about allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom they prefer.\nThe comment set Welch on a tirade, and she quickly responded that his claim was, 'total bulls**t.'\nEmanuel argued that transgender issues were 'tangential,' and not a core value on the left, to which Welch vehemently disagreed. \n'I’m so sick of Democrats like you selling out and saying this. You know who talks about trans people more than anybody? MAGA. MAGA is the most genital-obsessed political party I have ever seen,' she said. \nWelch argued that Harris did have a comprehensive economic plan and even referenced the vice president's proposal to provide up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. \nShe went on to slam Donald Trump for 'droning on about Hannibal Lecter' and accused Democrats of losing because they're 'playing the game with the rulebook' while Republicans have 'ripped up the rulebook.' \n\nWelch slammed Rahm Emanuel (right) for his stance on transgender rights in April \n\nEmanuel then threw up his hands and pushed back, saying as mayor, he did deal with the 'bathroom issue' but that transgender rights were not a cornerstone of the Democratic party. \n'They’re the gender-obsessed weirdos, [Republicans], not us [Democrats]. We’re the ones who fight for Social Security. We fight for Medicare, and yeah, we’re not gonna bully trans people,' Welch argued. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBravo star Jennifer Welch claims 'fat' Trump voters should be banned from Mexican restaurants in explosive rant\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 602\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Head over to a Cracker Barrel because no one wants to see your arrogant presence, with your small pink arm and large belly.”\n\n‘Nobody wants to see that s**t, no one.’\n\nFans quickly criticized the interior designer, labeling her as ‘pompous and arrogant.’ One person commented, “It’s often those who are the most intolerant and hateful who pretend to care for everyone.”\n\nOthers wrote: ‘Yes listen to this elite rich white woman. \n\n‘What a pompous, arrogant thing to say.\n\n‘Uber Karen. I voted for Trump and I’m having a burrito with chorizo and spinach dip for lunch today.\n\n‘I know a lot of black, Hispanic and Indian people who voted Trump three times as well.\n\nBack in April Welch had a tense debate with former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel when he joined I’ve Had It to discuss the problems within the Democratic Party.\n\nEmanuel previously served as Chicago’s mayor from 2011 to 2019, was an adviser to President Bill Clinton, served as President Barack Obama’s chief of staff and was an ambassador to Japan under President Joe Biden. \n\nThe two Democrats struggled to find a consensus on transgender rights and their conversation quickly morphed into a tense debate, hinting at a divide that may cause trouble in 2028. \n\nThe issue has become a divisive topic across the aisle, but Republicans have seemed to find unity, while Democrats haven’t formed a consensus on how to approach transgender rights. \n\nWelch, a more progressive member of the left, laid into Emanuel during their conversation when he accused Kamala Harris of not prioritizing economic issues, noting that Democrats weren’t ‘really good about the family room issues.’ \n\n‘The only room we were doing really well was the bathroom, and that’s the smallest room in the house,’ he continued, referencing the ongoing debate about allowing transgender individuals to use the bathroom they prefer.\n\nThe comment set Welch on a tirade, and she quickly responded that his claim was, ‘total bulls**t.’\n\nEmanuel argued that transgender issues were ‘tangential,’ and not a core value on the left, to which Welch vehemently disagreed. \n\n‘I’m so sick of Democrats like you selling out and saying this. You know who talks about trans people more than anybody? MAGA. MAGA is the most genital-obsessed political party I have ever seen,’ she said. \n\nWelch argued that Harris did have a comprehensive economic plan and even referenced the vice president’s proposal to provide up to $25,000 in down payment assistance for first-time homebuyers. \n\nShe went on to slam Donald Trump for ‘droning on about Hannibal Lecter’ and accused Democrats of losing because they’re ‘playing the game with the rulebook’ while Republicans have ‘ripped up the rulebook.’ \n\nEmanuel then threw up his hands and pushed back, saying as mayor, he did deal with the ‘bathroom issue’ but that transgender rights were not a cornerstone of the Democratic party. \n\n‘They’re the gender-obsessed weirdos, [Republicans], not us [Democrats]. We’re the ones who fight for Social Security. We fight for Medicare, and yeah, we’re not gonna bully trans people,’ Welch argued.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA former Bravo star has been slammed after claiming &#8216;fat a**&#8217; Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Bravo Celebrity Suggests Banning Trump Supporters from Mexican Restaurants first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/bravo-celebrity-suggests-banning-trump-supporters-from-mexican-restaurants/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Bravo-star-says-Trump-voters-should-be-banned-from-Mexican-restaurants.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-11 22:32:05","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.038},{"id":350317414,"title":"Trump seizes control of Washington DC police and deploys national guard","text":"Donald Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of the city’s police force, describing a “lawless” city in ways that are sharply at odds with official crime statistics.\n\nThe US president’s move was swiftly condemned as a “disgusting, dangerous and derogatory” assault on the political independence of a racially diverse city. The federal takeover is expected to be in effect for 30 days, the White House confirmed to the Guardian.\n\nSpeaking at a White House press conference on Monday, Trump said he was taking “a historic action to rescue our nation’s capital from crime, bloodshed, bedlam, and squalor and worse. This is liberation day in DC and we’re going to take our capital back.”\n\nHe described Washington DC as “one of the most dangerous cities anywhere in the world”, claiming its murder rate is higher than Bogotá or Mexico City, even though violent crime is at a 30-year low.\n\nThe defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, who was among officials joining Trump on the podium, said 800 national guard troops would take to the streets of Washington over the coming week. “They will be strong, they will be tough and they will stand with their law enforcement partners,” he said.\n\nTrump, who lost the presidential election in DC to Democrat Kamala Harris by 86 percentage points, added that he may send in the military “if needed”.\n\nBy invoking section 740 of the District of Columbia Home Rule Act, the president is federalising DC’s Metropolitan police department for the first time in its history. He said he was declaring a public safety emergency and putting the police under the control of the attorney general, Pam Bondi.\n\nTrump vowed to allow police to “do whatever the hell they want” in the face of provocations. “That’s the only language they [alleged criminals] understand. They like to spit in the face of the police. You spit, and we hit, and they get hit real hard.”\n\nSection 740 requires the mayor, Muriel Bowser, to provide “such services of the Metropolitan Police force as the President may deem necessary and appropriate”, when the president determines that there are “special conditions” requiring it. The president can only exercise such control under the act for 30 days without Congress passing a law extending it.\n\nAfter the former General Services Administration staffer Edward Coristine – a 19-year-old on the so-called “department of government efficiency” team nicknamed “Big Balls” – appeared to have been attacked by a group of young people last week near his car, Trump began discussing a return to federal control of the city and the use of national guard to quell street crime.\n\nWashington DC was hit hard by the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, recording more homicides in 2023 than in any year since 1997. At that time it was among the top five homicide rates in major population centres – those with more than a million residents – behind only Memphis in Tennessee, St Louis in Missouri and Baltimore in Maryland, according to the non-profit USAFacts.\n\nBut violent crime in Washington DC has fallen sharply since 2023, shaking off the pandemic increases to reach a 30-year low on the day Trump took office, and has fallen 26% further this year according to weekly reports from the Metropolitan police department. The change in crime rates is consistent with dramatic decreases in violence in large cities across the country.\n\nThe capital is much safer than it used to be. In 1991 it was branded the murder capital of the US with the killing of 482 people. By last year the total number of homicides had fallen to 187. This year the rate is on course to be lower.\n\nNonetheless, Trump ordered a range of federal law enforcement agencies to deploy on to DC streets over the weekend in a surge. About 450 officers from the United States Capitol police, the Federal Protective Service, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and other agencies were present into the city’s quadrants over the weekend.\n\nAt the press conference on Monday morning, Trump painted a nightmarish portrait of a city “overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals, roving mobs of wild youth, drugged out maniacs and homeless people”.\n\nThe DC attorney general, Jeanine Pirro, a former Fox News host only confirmed to her role on 2 August, said she saw “too much violent crime being committed by young punks who think that they can get together in gangs and crews and beat the hell out of you or anyone else”.\n\nPirro expressed her frustration with what she views as excessive leniency when it comes to the way juveniles are prosecuted. “I can’t arrest them. I can’t prosecute them,” she said. “They go to family court, and they get to do yoga and arts and crafts. Enough, it changes today.”\n\nPirro called for changes to the law to allow a wider range of juvenile cases to be heard in adult court.\n\nAgain taking to social media on Sunday, Trump demanded that homeless residents of the capital leave, posting images of encampments ostensibly taken from his motorcade.\n\n“The Homeless have to move out, IMMEDIATELY,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday morning, shortly after being driven from the White House to his golf club in Virginia. “We will give you places to stay, but FAR from the Capital.”\n\nHomelessness rates in the nation’s capital have also been falling, with the most recent point-in-time count showing a decrease from 2024.\n\nMonday’s announcement by Trump, who pardoned his supporters who attacked the US Capitol in Washington on 6 January 2021, was criticised by Democrats and civil rights leaders.\n\nEleanor Holmes Norton, a non-voting delegate representing DC in the House of Representatives, said the decision “is an historic assault on DC home rule, is a counterproductive, escalatory seizure of DC’s resources to use for purposes not supported by DC residents, and is more evidence of the urgent need to pass my DC statehood bill”.\n\nKen Martin, the chair of the Democratic National Committee, said: “Trump is once again playing political games using service members and federal law enforcement officials. Trump doesn’t give a damn about keeping DC residents safe.\n\n“When rioters violently stormed the Capitol and there were repeated requests for the national guard, Trump failed to act. To add insult to injury, he released from jail those 1,500 violent insurrectionists who assaulted police officers and broke local and federal law.”\n\nAl Sharpton, the founder and president of the National Action Network, suggested that the intervention was motivated by a desire to distract from criticisms over the administration’s handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files.\n\n“Donald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” he said. “Let’s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files.”\n\nLater Muriel Bowser, the mayor of DC, who has pursued a non-confrontational relationship with Trump, described the intervention as “unsettling and unprecedented” but declined to criticise the president directly.\n\n“I’ve said before, and I’ll repeat, that I believe that the president’s view of DC is shaped by his Covid-era experience during his first term,” she told reporters.\n\n“It is true that those were more challenging times related to some issues. It is also true that we experienced a crime spike post-Covid but we worked quickly to put laws in place and tactics that got violent offenders off our streets, and gave our police officers more tools.”\n\nBowser said her office plans to follow the law and cooperate with the federal government, though “I don’t want to minimise the intrusion on our autonomy”. She has requested a meeting with Bondi, who will temporarily oversee the Metropolitan police department.\n\nFlanked by Pamela Smith, the DC police chief, and other city officials, Bowser added: “While this action today is unsettling and unprecedented, I can’t say that, given some of the rhetoric of the past, we’re totally surprised. I can say to DC residents that we will continue to operate our government in a way that makes you proud.”\n\nAsked about Trump’s hint that he could deploy the US military if required, the mayor replied: “I think I speak for all Americans. We don‘t believe it is legal to use the American military against American citizens on American soil. I am not a lawyer, but I think that is a fairly widely held fact.”\n\nMeanwhile Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic minority leader in the House, described Trump as a “wannabe king” and argued his plan to “unleash the national guard on the city’s youth and homeless population has no basis in law and will put the safety of the people of our nation’s capital in danger”.\n\nHe added: “We stand with the residents of the District of Columbia and reject this unjustified power grab as illegitimate.”Shrai Popat contributed reporting","summary":"President claims US capital ‘overtaken by violent gangs and bloodthirsty criminals … and homeless people’\n\n\nUS politics – live updates\n\nDonald Trump has ordered the national guard to Washington DC and seized control of the city’s police force, describing a “lawless” city in ways that are sharply at odds with official crime statistics.\n\nThe US president’s move was swiftly condemned as a “disgusting, dangerous and derogatory” assault on the political independence of a racially diverse city.

He simultaneously announced the Pentagon would deploy US National Guard forces to the city of more than 700,000.\n\nGathered just blocks away, with the White House looming in the background, protesters erupted in a chorus of “boos”.\n\nThe Pentagon later said 800 soldiers were activated on Monday, with 100-200 of them supporting law enforcement.\n\nTrump’s latest move, said Keya Chatterjee, the executive director of Free DC, was not just another salvo against the long marginalised rights of the residents of the city, but a “major escalation”.\n\n“This goes beyond the sort of words people have been using, like ‘unprecedented and ‘unusual,'” said Chatterjee, whose group advocates for DC self-determination.\n\n“This is just authoritarianism,” she told Al Jazeera, over the chants from the crowd.\n\n‘Represent ourselves’\n\nThe rights of the hundreds of thousands of residents of Washington, DC have been the subject of debate since it was established by Congress in 1790 with land from Maryland and Virginia.\n\nThe district continues to fall under the direct auspices of the federal government, having never been granted statehood. However, it maintains a level of local autonomy per the Home Rule Act of 1973, which allows residents to elect some local officials. Congress still reviews all legislation passed by those elected officials and approves the district’s budget.\n\nThe city’s superlative as the first Black majority city in the US, and its current status as a Black plurality city, has further added a racial dynamic to what advocates have long decried as the systematic disenfranchisement of its residents.\n\nCivil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton called the move the “ultimate affront to justice and civil rights,” in a statement.\n\n“Donald Trump was inspired to take this disgusting, dangerous, and derogatory action solely out of self interest,” Sharpton said in a statement. “Let’s call the inspiration for this assault on a majority Black city for what it is: another bid to distract his angry, frustrated base over his administration’s handling of the Epstein files.”\n\nIn March, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser agreed to rename the Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, where Monday’s protest was held, amid pressure from Trump and concerns that federal funding could be withheld.\n\nBowser said Monday that the deployment of the National Guard was “unsettling”, but not without precedent.\n\n“My message to residents is this,” Bowser said. “We know that access to our democracy is tenuous. That is why you have heard me and many Washingtonians before me advocate for full statehood.”\n\nFor many gathered on Monday, Trump’s move again underscored how little power they had in directly influencing the policies of the local law enforcement that directly oversees their community.\n\nAmari Jack, a 20-year-old college student, described what he saw as “the first step” in a wider consolidation of power over the city, noting Trump has for years floated the idea of taking more full control of the metropolis surrounding the White House. Such a move would likely require Congress overturning the Home Rule Act.\n\n“I came out today because I was really scared about the potential that DC could lose any autonomy it has,” Jack told Al Jazeera.\n\n“I feel like as DC natives, born and raised, we need to be able to represent ourselves and enrich our communities. We can’t just have a president come in and rule over our home.”\n\nCrime as a pretext?\n\nFor his part, in an order declaring the “emergency”, Trump decried what he called the “city government’s failure to maintain public order and safety”, claiming crime rates posed “intolerable risks to the vital Federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”.\n\nSpeaking to reporters from the White House, Trump vowed to “take our capital back”, outlining what he described as “massive enforcement operations targeting known gangs, drug dealers and criminal networks to get them the hell off the street”.\n\nTrump further claimed he was “getting rid of the slums”, and would clear homeless people from the city, without offering further details of his plans.\n\nAmong those pushing back on the characterisation was the District of Columbia Attorney General Brian Schwalb, who called the move “unprecedented, unnecessary, and unlawful.”\n\n“There is no crime emergency in the District of Columbia,” he said.\n\nWhile DC crime rates are typically higher than the national average, violent crime rates have dropped significantly in recent years, plummeting 35 percent from 2023 to 2024 and another 26 percent this year compared to the same period last year, according to Metropolitan Police data.\n\nEarly this year, the Justice Department announced that violent crime in DC had hit a 30-year low.\n\nGroups like the Center for American Progress have attributed the decline to both local law enforcement strategies, as well as “investments in crime prevention and resources such as housing and education and employment supports”.\n\nTwenty-year-old Radha Tanner, like many gathered, saw Trump as using the pretext of crime to enact a wider political mission, one that paints Democrat-dominated cities like DC as “unsafe and riddled with crime”.\n\nOver 90 percent of DC voters supported Trump’s Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election. Trump, in turn, won about 6.5 percent of the vote.\n\nTanner saw Monday’s moves as in line with Trump’s deployment of the National Guard and Marines to Los Angeles, California to aid in immigration crackdowns and the protests they spurred.\n\n“He’s doing this to make an example out of a city full of Democrats that is vulnerable because we don’t have representation,” Tanner said.\n\n‘Best place for us to resist’\n\nMaurice Carney, 60, saw a similar goal in Trump’s actions, arguing that long-term investment, not a short-term commandeering of local law enforcement or the deployment of the National Guard, would actually show a real commitment to addressing crime.\n\n“When you see this increase in militarisation, whether it’s in DC or on the African continent or anywhere else in the world, you always see an increase in violence, either from resistance or from creating an environment that’s unstable,” said Carney, who works with a DC-based group that advocates for citizens of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\n“Like it or not, DC is seen as the capital of the empire, the capital of the world,” Carney told Al Jazeera. “So if Trump wants to show he’s this ‘law and order’ guy, DC is the best place for him to do that.”\n\n“It’s also the best place for us to resist,” he said, “for us to stand up and let the rest of the world know that even right in the heart of the empire, the people – local residents of DC – resisted.”","summary":"Trump takes control of police, deploys National Guard in a move DC-rights activist calls &#039;just authoritarianism&#039;.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/11/us-protesters-say-trump-using-crime-emergency-to-justify-dc-takeover?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25223532371698-1754938325.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-11 20:28:00","author":"Apps Support,Joseph Stepansky","authors":["Apps Support","Joseph Stepansky"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":0.189},{"id":350198566,"title":"Millie Bobby Brown Is Giving Cozy-Chic in Crocs’ New Furry Clogs","text":"Skip to main content\n\nAugust 11, 2025 1:20pm\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nCourtesy of Lillie Eiger for Crocs\n\nShare on Facebook\n\nShare to Flipboard\n\nSend an Email\n\nShow additional share options\n\nShare on LinkedIn\n\nShare on Pinterest\n\nShare on Reddit\n\nShare on Tumblr\n\nShare on Whats App\n\nPrint the Article\n\nPost a Comment\n\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\n\nCrocs have always been comfy, but now they’re cozy, too.\n\nThe cult-favorite footwear brand has tapped Millie Bobby Brown as global ambassador and the face of its new Surrey Hills-set campaign, highlighting the brand’s latest drop: the Classic Unfurgettable Clog.

Each one of them involves obvious improprieties that necessitate investigations. In many instances, I believe investigators will find criminal activity, which ought to be prosecuted.\n\nIt is encouraging and heartening to see that the Department of Justice has taken up a criminal investigation into New York Attorney General Letitia “Tish” James and that the Office of the Special Counsel is investigating Special Counsel Jack Smith. This could mark a new era of accountability in this country and a return to law and order.\n\nLast week, I offered a list of people who ought to get investigated by the DOJ. After reflecting on the list for a few days, I have concluded that the next person who ought to face deep scrutiny is Judge Juan Merchan, who presided over the Stormy Daniels (not-)”hush money” case. (Hush money is not illegal; it was a case about falsifying business records.)\n\nMerchan, a partisan Democrat from a deeply partisan family, presided over the most partisan political persecution of any I documented in the book. He relied on unprecedented absurdities to get Trump branded as a “convicted felon” just ahead of the election. This was a grave miscarriage of justice.\n\nThe improprieties in the case are too numerous to ignore. Here are some of them:\n\nHe’s a Joe Biden Donor\n\nThis is grounds for an ethics investigation already. Under Section 100.5 of the New York Code of Judicial Conduct, sitting judges cannot “directly or indirectly engage in any political activity.” Prohibited political activity includes “soliciting funds for, paying an assessment to, or making a contribution to a political organization or candidate.” The New York State Advisory Committee on Judicial Ethics is unequivocal: “A sitting judge may not make political contributions at any time, even to a U.S. presidential candidate.”\n\nHe literally gave to a group called “Stop Republicans.” It wasn’t much money: ten dollars. But that’s ten too much according to the law. \n\nHis Daughter Is a Democrat MEGA-Fundraiser \n\nMerchan’s daughter, Loren Merchan, is an activist Democrat with ties to the prosecution. She is president of a Chicago-based leftist consulting firm, Authentic Campaigns, which counts the Senate Majority PAC, a major fundraiser for Democrats, and then-Congressman Adam Schiff as clients. Schiff was the lead manager prosecuting Trump in his first impeachment trial and would go on to become a senator from California.\n\nThe New York Post reported in March 2024 that Loren Merchan’s consultancy had raised at least $93 million in campaign donations for the election cycle. That number no doubt ballooned from there.\n\nAuthentic Campaigns bagged a staggering $36,414,889 during the 2024 election cycle, according to Open Secrets. This would make Loren Merchan one of the Democrats’ biggest fundraisers.\n\nShe was also tied to Dan Goldman, another impeachment attorney, and worked for “Kamala Harris for the People.”\n\nFor Loren Merchan’s father to preside over a trial where Trump is the defendant in an election is, as Trump put it to me, “the greatest conflict of interest of all time.”\n\nInappropriate Use of Gag Orders – Which Remains in Place \n\nMerchan gagged Trump, ordering him to not make public comments about witnesses, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, connected family members (did he have his Democrat consultant daughter in mind?), and others. He threatened Trump with fines or up to thirty days in jail.\n\nI asked President Trump in March 2025 if the gag order remained in place. “Nobody knows,” he said. “The case is over and nobody knows if it still applies. He never took it off. You know why? Because he knows how crooked it was.”\n\nAllowing the Court to Degenerate into Debauchery\n\nMerchan allowed the porn star and professional provocateur Stormy Daniels to take the stand, and her testimony was exactly what you would have expected. She shared graphic details of the alleged encounters that left jurors cringing. She reportedly made jokes that fell flat.\n\nViolation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendment Rights \n\nThe Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution demands that a defendant “be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation.”\n\nAs I explain in Breaking the Law, D.A. Alvin Bragg had to piggyback Trump’s supposed falsifying business records crime to a secondary crime in order to get it classified as a felony from a misdemeanor. If he failed to do so, the statute of limitations would have run out. (That this was attempted is obvious evidence that this was a targeted political prosecution.)\n\nThe second crime finally came to light during the jury instructions.\n\nAccording to the court, Donald Trump attempted to influence an election by “unlawful means.” What were the unlawful means? Well, nobody ever specified. Instead of solving the unnamed crime issue, this only made it worse. The charge introduced a third (!) mystery crime piggybacking off the second one.\n\nIf this is sounding ridiculous, just wait until you hear that the third crime was not specified, ever!\n\nMerchan told the jury that the third crime could be multiple choice. It was a choose-your-own-adventure trial. He informed the jury that if they agreed that Trump falsified business records to influence an election, they no longer had to agree unanimously.\n\nAt a constitutional level, the jury verdict needed to be unanimous. But in Merchan’s courtroom, it did not need to be unanimous on the third crime. The jury merely needed to agree that there was a third crime, any crime.\n\nIn addition to Trump’s being denied his Sixth Amendment rights to being informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, Merchan was now denying Trump due process rights afforded to him by the Fifth Amendment.\n\nIt was absolute lunacy that this was allowed to go on.\n\nBlocking a Key Trump Witness \n\nOn the menu for the third crime was a Federal Election Commission Act (FECA) violation. While the porn star Daniels was allowed to take the stand and contradict herself, Mechan blocked the Trump team’s effort to bring in former member of the Federal Election Commission Bradley A. Smith to explain this area of the law to the jury. I see no other explanation for this other than it may have ruined Bragg’s case.\n\nConvicted Felon Trickery\n\nMerchan allowed for a dirty trick to allow for the “convicted felon” branding to stick to Trump into his second presidency.\n\nAfter Trump was convicted, and subsequently won the election anyway, Judge Merchan set sentencing for President Trump during the transition of power from Biden to Trump, on January 10, 2025. Merchan wanted to make sure he could brand Trump with the “convicted felon” tag before he became president, when it would be impossible (or at least overly complicated) to take the case any further.\n\nNow, if Trump wants to clear his name—and he certainly does—it will take years of effort.\n\nAll of this is designed to distract him during his presidency.\n\nPerhaps all of this is legal, but it is nonetheless outrageous and deeply anti-democratic to try to sabotage a president in this way.\n\nOther Improprieties\n\nThere were a series of other peculiarities and outrages in the case that are documented in Breaking the Law, such as the presence of Matthew Colangelo, the wringer brought in from the very top of Biden’s DOJ to Alvin Bragg’s Manhattan D.A. office in order to try win the case against Trump. And consider that the case would likely never have happened if the government did not have access to former-Trump attorney Michael Cohen’s gmail account as part of the investigations into the Russia collusion hoax. (Throw all the felony convictions out based on that alone!)\n\nReaders will have to read the book to see the full accounting of them all.\n\nStill, there is one more reason to investigate Juan Merchan:\n\nElection Interference\n\nThe Stormy Daniels case, like all six of the major cases against Trump, amounted to election interference. They were trying to jail him or at least monopolize his time to hamper his ability to campaign. “I should be out campaigning now instead of sitting in a very cold courthouse all day long,” Trump told reporters outside the courtroom. “This is a Biden prosecution. It’s election interference at a level that nobody in this country has ever seen before.”\n\n“This all comes from in the White House,” he said.\n\nHe was 100 percent correct. If Joe Biden had suggested this was an unfair targeted prosecution at any point, the charges certainly would have been dropped, and America could have resumed our tradition of free and fair elections.\n\nNot in Juan Merchan’s courtroom. He and Biden were going to see this through to the bitter end, which they no doubt believed saw Trump in an orange jumpsuit.\n\nThis article was adapted from portions of Breaking the Law.\n\nBreaking the Law: Exposing the Weaponization of America’s Legal System Against Donald Trump, which has been hailed by President Trump as a “must read” book, is available in hardcover, eReader format, and as an audiobook read by the author himself.\n\nAlex Marlow is the editor-in-chief of Breitbart News, a two-time New York Times bestselling author, and the host of “The Alex Marlow Show” podcast produced weekdays by Breitbart News and Salem Podcast Network.

UFC and WWE merged to create TKO in 2023.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Paramount currently has no plans to charge additional fees for access to the UFC fights.\nWith UFC fights occurring throughout the year with no real set schedule, this should keep MMA fans tethered to their Paramount+ subscriptions for longer.\nMeaning you won’t see fans cancelling when the season is over in the same way that baseball or football fans might after the championship games end.\n\nSign up to get the BEST of Tom's Guide direct to your inbox.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\n(Image credit: Chris Unger/Zuffa LLC via Getty Images)\n“UFC is a unicorn asset that comes up about once a decade,” said TKO Group CEO David Ellison. TKO Group\nBetween UFC and Paramount itself, Skydance has spent 15 billion dollars in less than a month. And it may not be done.\nReportedly, Paramount also wants the international rights to air UFC bouts. Due to the US deal, the company has an exclusive negotiation window with more than 20 countries that air UFC, allowing it, and because of the US deal, the company has an exclusive negotiation window with more than 20 countries that air UFC to secure those deals.\nTKO seems prepared for the future going forward as the company just inked a five-year, $1.6 billion deal with ESPN that gives the sports brand the U.S. rights to premium WWE live events.\nMoving fast\n\n(Image credit: Monticello/Shutterstock)\nThere are reports that Paramount placated the FCC and President Trump’s administration by settling a lawsuit with Trump over a “60 Minutes” Kamala Harris interview. This could have influenced the FCC to let the Skydance purchase go through.\nThe $16 million settlement will be allocated to a future Trump presidential library.\nThat and the controversial cancellation of “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” has some speculating that CBS and Paramount are making moves to pacify President Trump and enable deals like the Skydance purchase.\nEither way, the deal is done, and Paramount is diving headfirst into its new Skydance era with huge streaming moves.\nFollow Tom's Guide on Google News to get our up-to-date news, how-tos, and reviews in your feeds.

For the first time in his illustrious career, the signing made Stern no longer the biggest, most relevant star at SiriusXM. By agreeing to pay Cooper $125 million over just three years, the satellite media company also signaled a shift in strategy: from live radio to on-demand podcasting. Now, a year later, reports suggest Stern is unlikely to re-sign with the platform this fall. According to The Sun, Cooper’s growing influence could be a contributing factor. \"She’s the one that bugs him,\" an insider told the Sun earlier this week. \"She gets hundreds of millions of hits, she has this mega $125 million deal, and he hates that this young bubbly woman is the big new thing.\" Reportedly, executives go out of their way to keep the two talents apart. \"That’s who they have to keep Howard away from when she comes to New York.\" Cooper, 30, is based in Los Angeles. Stern, meanwhile, typically broadcasts from the basement of his New York-area home, with only occasional studio appearances. Radio vs. podcast Stern, a radio stalwart, used to scoff at the idea of podcasting. He vowed that it would never replace terrestrial or satellite radio in influence. Well, for younger generations, it has. \"Alex and Joe Rogan, these massive podcasters, have traditional radio guys stunned,\" another insider told the outlet. The insider said Cooper is \"female, she’s the next generation.\" Stern was long the premier interviewer in media. The biggest stars in Hollywood and D.C. clamored for an appearance on his show. Today, that is no longer the case – thanks to podcasters like Cooper. Last October, Cooper interviewed Kamala Harris days before Stern. Harris' team reportedly pushed Cooper to interview the then-vice president for weeks, understanding her audience and appeal to young women. This had to irk Stern, who campaigned aggressively on-air for Harris after Biden bowed out of the race in July 2024. Moreover, the accessibility of podcasts like \"Call Her Daddy\" can make Stern's program feel archaic. Listeners can find \"Call Her Daddy\" anytime for free on YouTube, Spotify, and Apple, while they must pay a $15-a-month fee to listen to Stern live on radio. Stern's declining relevance As Clay Travis often says, \"the old Howard Stern would think the new Howard Stern is a pussy.\" We concur. Since COVID, Stern has become increasingly crusty and erratic. As late as 2023, he was still shaming people for hosting holiday gatherings (including Oprah Winfrey). And his TDS is as severe as Stephen Colbert's and Jimmy Kimmel's. Last fall, he clarified that he doesn't \"hate\" Trump but \"hates\" the \"people who vote for Trump.\" He then ordered that all Trump voters stop listening to his show. \"I'm at the end of my career, so fuck you and listen to another station if you don't like my views [on Trump],\" Stern told his audience. Stern also bragged about \"being woke\" on his show: \"I am a woke motherfucker, and I love it. I want to be awake. I want to read legitimate news sources. Here’s how woke I am. I believe the election was not rigged. I am woke. I think that’s a compliment,\" Stern declared. \"And if woke means I can’t get behind Trump, which is what I think it means, or that I support people who want to be transgender or I’m for the vaccine, dude call me woke as you fucking want.\" As Clay said... And, let's be honest: both Stern and Cooper lean heavily into banter about sex. Listeners and guests will always choose the attractive 30-year-old woman discussing her sex life over the ugly 71-year-old man fantasizing about a better sex life. Frankly, we understand why Stern dislikes Cooper and why SiriusXM would rather have her than him moving forward.","summary":"Howard Stern reportedly &apos;can&apos;t stand&apos; colleague and &apos;Call Her Daddy&apos; host Alex Cooper.","url":"https://www.outkick.com/analysis/howard-stern-reportedly-cant-stand-colleague-call-her-daddy-host-alex-cooper","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2024/08/Screenshot-2024-08-20-at-5.42.06-PM.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-11 18:32:41","author":"Bobby Burack","authors":["Bobby Burack"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.05},{"id":350167916,"title":"What Trump's Executive Order Means for Your Retirement Accounts","text":"Enable Accessibility\nSkip to Content\n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nB Inspired \n\nEntertainment\n\nLondon / Europe\nBorder / Cartel Chronicles\nIsrael / Middle East\n\nLatin America\n\nOn the Hill\n\nOn the Hill Articles\nOn The Hill Exclusive Video\n\nBreitbart News Daily\n\nNewsletters Signup \n\n BREITBART\n\nDC Crime Crackdown\nTexas Redistricting\nRussia Hoax Exposed\n\nIsrael vs Hamas\n\nWhat Trump’s Executive Order Means for Your Retirement Accounts\n\n Official White House Photo by Joyce N.
