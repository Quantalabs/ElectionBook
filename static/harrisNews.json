Actor exchanges vows in intimate London ceremony as his former co-stars send their congratulations\n\nHave YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy AMELIA WYNNE, SHOWBUSINESS REPORTER \n Published:00:07 GMT, 28 October 2025 |Updated:00:47 GMT, 28 October 2025 \n\nGame Of Thrones star Isaac Hempstead Wright has confirmed he is married after exchanging vows over the weekend. \nThe actor rose to fame as crippled Bran Stark in the HBO television series, which earned him a Young Artist Award nomination as Best Young Supporting Actor in a TV Series. \nNow 26-years old and the holder of a university degree in neuroscience, Isaac shared a series of photos from his intimate London ceremony as he wed his partner, who he simply referred to as 'M'.\nCaptioning the shots, he wrote: 'The best person I have ever met, the best day of my life, the best friends and family we could ever ask for. What a day, what a life - I love you M.\n'An enormous thank you to everyone who made the day so special.'\nThe images showed them emerging from the ceremony as confetti was thrown by their friends and family.\n\nGame Of Thrones star Isaac Hempstead Wright has confirmed he is married after exchanging vows over the weekend \n\nOver the weekend he shared snaps from his intimate London ceremony as he wed his partner who he simply referred to as 'M'\n\nThe actor, 26, played Bran Stark in the HBO television series, which earned him a Young Artist Award nomination as Best Young Supporting Actor in a TV Series\nThey then took a red London bus to their reception to enjoy the evening with dinner and dancing.\nHis on-screen sister, Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), gushed in the comments: 'Congratulations Isaaaaaac!!!!!!'\nWhile John Bradley, (Samwell Tarly) added: 'Oh MATE!! Congratulations! ❤️' \nBack in 2019 when the series ended Isaac revealed he did not expect his character Bran to ascend to the Iron Throne in the divisive season finale. \nThe British actor told 9Honey he was nonetheless pleased that a 'disabled character' was crowned king.\nHaving joined the cast of Game of Thrones when he was 12, Isaac didn't have the 'slightest inkling' that the youngest living Stark would become King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men.\n'Nobody thought it was going to be Bran - least of all me! So I didn't even have a slight inkling,' he said. \nIsaac also spoke of his pride at Bran representing the disabled community on screen.\n\nHe penned in the caption of his snaps: 'The best person I have ever met, the best day of my life, the best friends and family we could ever ask for. What a day, what a life - I love you M'\n\nHis on-screen sister, Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), gushed in the comments: 'Congratulations Isaaaaaac!!!!!!'\n\nBack in 2019 when the series ended Isaac revealed he did not expect his character Bran to ascend to the Iron Throne in the divisive season finale\n'I think it's brilliant to have a disabled character win the whole game. What are the odds of that? There are dragons and all these other things going on and Bran comes out on top, it was really special,' he said.\nHe was particularly happy that his character went from 'Bran the Broken' to 'The Lord of the Six Kingdoms'.\n'In the very first episode, you think he's toast, he's dead,' he explained, referring to when Bran was pushed out a window by Jaime Lannister. \n'He goes from being this vulnerable character to the most powerful there is,' he added.\nIsaac revealed at the time that he liked the controversial ending, but acknowledged that it would have been impossible for the writers to please everybody. \n'I think the thing to remember is Game of Thrones isn't a superhero movie, it's not all going to be tied up in a neat bow when you find out everything about all these people, that's not how it works,' he said. \nHe has also previously said he thought he received a 'joke script' as he said he understood why die-hard fans were angry with the ending. \n\n Game Of Thrones star Isaac Hempstead Wright admits he thought the final script was a JOKE as he lends sympathy to 'broken-hearted' fans \nHe told Entertainment Weekly: 'I genuinely thought it was a joke script and that show runners [David Benioff and D.B. Weiss] sent to everyone a script with their own character ends up on the Iron Throne. \"Yeah, good one guys... Oh s**t, it's actually real?\"\nHe also lent his sympathies to unhappy fans but he countered it would be 'so difficult' to wrap up the show without 'p***ing some people off'.\nIn the dramatic final shock twist, the rightful heir to the Iron Throne Jon Snow (Kit Harington) was exiled for stabbing his lover Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke).\nJon was handed the punishment to live out the rest of his days with the Night's Watch, take no wife and father no children for the murder of the Mad Queen. \nWhile the pack survived, the Stark family went their separate ways in an emotional sequence that broke fans hearts.\nBran was named king of the six kingdoms, Sansa (Sophie Turner) became Queen in the North while Arya (Maisie Williams) headed out to explore unknown territory. \nThrowing his support behind the HBO bosses, Isaac pointed out the ending wasn't 'predictable' and that was what the producers were hoping for. \n\nBran was named king of the six kingdoms, Sansa (Sophie Turner) became Queen in the North while Arya (Maisie Williams) headed out to explore unknown territory\nLondonHBOSophie TurnerGame of Thrones\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nGame of Thrones star Isaac Hempstead Wright is married!

Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris — begs the next question: Does a California Democrat stand a chance of winning the White House?\n\nNo state has been more maligned by Republicans, especially by President Trump, than the golden one. Harris, in an abbreviated campaign where she was painted as a “radical California liberal,” lost to Trump in November by a narrow vote margin, but a sweep of red states.\n\nAnd with every social media mention of Newsom — especially his acerbic posts mocking Trump — a flood of comments are posted follow blaming him for all of California’s ills, from San Francisco’s stubborn homeless problem to the devastating Los Angeles fires.\n\nAt a time when the country remains deeply divided between urban and rural voters, and Trump’s influence over the Republican party continues unabated, is California’s political baggage too heavy for both of them? Can their personal brands in a national campaign supersede the weighted label of a California Democrat to ultimately appeal to voters in the Heartland?\n\n“They absolutely have a chance,” said Thad Kousser, UC San Diego political science professor. “Polls have consistently shown that they’re the two candidates on the top of people’s minds right now. Now that doesn’t mean that they’re the true favorites, but I think each is a political heavyweight who has a real opportunity here.”\n\nPolitical science professor David McCuan of Sonoma State is not so sure.\n\n“It’s hard to see a Californian winning the hearts and minds of voters in three key battlegrounds that you have to flip to win, which are Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin,” McCuan said. “Those three states have gone with the winner every presidential election together since 1992.”\n\nSo what’s it going to take?\n\n“Lightning in a bottle,” McCuan said.\n\nNeither Newsom nor Harris, longtime political allies who have both progressive and centrist bonafides, have committed to the 2028 race yet. Despite breathless news coverage about the possibility, their comments during weekend TV interviews barely moved the needle.\n\n“Possibly,” Harris told the BBC when asked if she might be president one day. Although she hasn’t decided to run, she said, “I am not done. I have lived my entire career as a life of service and it’s in my bones.”\n\n“I’d be lying otherwise,” Newsom told CBS Sunday Morning when asked whether he would seriously consider a presidential run after the 2026 midterm elections.\n\nNonetheless, the potential for a Golden State match-up between dueling political cousins presents interesting dynamics for both a Democratic presidential primary as well as the general election, should one of them get that far.\n\nThe political pathways of Harris and Newsom have largely mirrored each other since both were elected to political office in San Francisco in 2003 — Newsom as mayor and Harris as district attorney. Newsom, whose second term as California runs out at the start of 2027, has become a champion of redistricting Proposition 50. Harris advanced to state attorney general, U.S. senator and, under President Biden, vice president.\n\n“It’s almost impossible to see a situation in which they both end up in competition,” said Dan Schnur, who teaches political communications at UC Berkeley and USC. “One of them would end up leaving the race fairly quickly. There’s not enough room for both.”\n\nThey each face separate challenges. Harris, who recently released her memoir “107 Days” explaining her failed presidential campaign, will have to convince voters why she deserves another chance.\n\n“Democrats are going to want to make it very much a change election,” said Bill Whalen, a Hoover Institute distinguished policy fellow. “They’re going to want to find a shiny new object to rally behind. She is clearly not that.”\n\nThe challenge for Newsom, is that he might be peaking too early, he said.\n\nNewsom has become Trump’s top antagonist, posting a barrage of social media messages trolling Trump about everything from the president’s White House ballroom to his girth. Along the way, Newsom has poked fun at himself, posing as superheroes.\n\nDespite Newsom’s constant reminder that California is among the world’s largest economies, he will have a lot of explaining to do about the problems he hasn’t fixed in California, including high housing prices and some of the highest unemployment and poverty rates in the country.\n\n“Newsom has all sorts of advantages coming into this race, most notably that he’s emerged as the party’s most forceful and most effective Trump critic,” Schnur said. “But it’s not hard to imagine one of his primary opponents running an ad with three seconds of grainy video of the Mission District in San Francisco with the caption, ‘this is Gavin Newsom’s California.'”\n\nDespite the naysayers, and two-and-a-half year lag before the spring 2028 presidential primary season, both Harris and Newsom are running away with the top two spots for the Democratic primary — both above 20% of polling averages. Left in the single digits are former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, U.S. Sen. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker.\n\nSeveral polls are already taking the far-away contest one step further. Polymarket, which predicts election outcomes by combining news, polls and expert opinions into a value based on a market’s view, shows who would lead a contest between Newsom as the Democratic nominee and Republican Vice President J.D. Vance.\n\nThe projected winner? J.D. Vance, with a 29% chance of winning, compared with Newsom with a 23% chance.\n\nAs much as personality appears to rule the day — Trump is a New York billionaire developer whose bombastic style captured the souls of discontented rural Americans — the 2028 presidential race might come down to simple, timeworn economic forces.\n\nIn each of the last three elections, the economic models that studied where the economy was going and whether people wanted change all correctly predicted a Trump victory in 2016, a Biden victory in 2020 and a Trump re-election victory in 2024, said Kousser of UC San Diego.\n\n“Candidates have to play the economic hand that they’re dealt,” Kousser said. “Voters may well want to see a change in the direction of the country in 2028 and turn to a Democrat, even if that Democrat is someone who comes with the baggage of being from California.”","summary":"At a time when the country remains deeply divided between urban and rural voters and Trump’s influence over the Republican party continues to grow, is California’s political baggage too heavy for both of them?","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/10/27/with-newsom-and-harris-considering-presidential-run-could-america-choose-a-california-democrat/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/BRN-L-ELIAS-COL-0712-1-e1720235947614.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 23:53:43","author":"Julia Prodis Sulek","authors":["Julia Prodis Sulek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.4},{"id":373182014,"title":"Obama’s reaction to Nancy Pelosi’s ‘surprise’ endorsement of Kamala Harris revealed: ‘What the f–k did you just do?’  ","text":"Former President Barack Obama was “not happy” with Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) quick endorsement of then-Vice President Kamala Harris — and he let it be known in a phone call with the former House speaker, according to a new book. \n\nPelosi described Harris as “brilliantly astute” and expressed “full confidence” that the ex-California senator could defeat President Trump in her endorsement statement, which came less than 24 hours after Joe Biden ended his 2024 re-election bid. \n\nObama, who preferred to let “a process” determine Trump’s Democratic Party opponent, called Pelosi shortly after her endorsement to vent his frustration — having thought they were on the same page, ABC News’ Jonathan Karl wrote in “Retribution,” out Tuesday. \n\n“The Obamas were not happy,” a Pelosi confidant told Karl, according to an excerpt obtained by the Daily Mail. \n\n“This person summed up Obama’s message to Pelosi as, essentially, ‘What the f–k did you just do?’”\n\nIt has been widely reported that the 44th president wanted an open convention to determine the party’s nominee, rather than anointing Harris after Biden’s shocking drop-out. \n\nObama reportedly had serious concerns about Harris’ competence and her ability to beat Trump in the general election. \n\n“That train has left the station,” Pelosi reportedly told Obama during their call, according to Karl, apparently referring to Biden’s quick endorsement of Harris after announcing his decision to end his campaign. \n\nKarl wrote that Obama and Pelosi both “agreed Harris should not simply be handed the nomination unchallenged.” \n\n“Therefore, Obama and Pelosi — arguably the two most influential figures in the Democratic Party — had privately agreed to abstain from making any endorsements,” the journalist claimed. \n\nThe pair had been in “regular communication” leading up to Biden’s July 21, 2024, withdrawal announcement, which is why Obama was so stunned by Pelosi’s decision to back Harris. \n\nA source close to Obama described the former president’s conversation with Pelosi as “’good-natured ribbing,” rather than heated, according to Karl. \n\n“The former president wanted to know what had happened. Why had Pelosi issued a statement endorsing Harris so soon? Hadn’t he and Pelosi agreed days earlier that party leaders anointing the vice president as Biden’s replacement would be a mistake?” Karl writes. \n\nHowever, the source close to Pelosi felt Obama sounded “genuinely irritated” on the call. \n\nAt least one Biden official believed that Obama, who waited five days after the then-81-year-old president dropped out to endorse Harris, didn’t think the former vice president could win. \n\n“There’s only one Black Jesus,” the senior Biden adviser told Karl. \n\nLike Obama, Pelosi’s husband was also surprised by the former House speaker’s decision. \n\n“Kamala?” Paul Pelosi asked his wife, according to Karl. \n\nTo which Nancy Pelosi shot back: “Don’t start with me.” \n\nIn “Retribution,” Karl notes that with big-name Democrats, such as the Clintons, and potential challengers, like Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and California Gov. Gavin Newsom, quickly endorsing Harris, Pelosi “had no choice.” \n\n“No other candidates had stepped forward — Kamala Harris was it. The only thing Pelosi could do was try to help her win the election,” he wrote. \n\nPelosi’s office did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.","summary":"Obama, who preferred to let “a process” determine Trump’s Democratic Party opponent, called Pelosi shortly after her endorsement to vent his frustration – having thought they were on the same page.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/us-news/obamas-reaction-to-nancy-pelosis-surprise-endorsement-of-kamala-harris-revealed/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/former-president-barack-obama-moderates-114314493.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Ogw9rgDG-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-27 23:48:14","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.731},{"id":373178434,"title":"New video emerges of King Charles heckler being pulled by bystander after he yelled at monarch about Prince Andrew ","text":"Home and Garden\n\nLatest Headlines\n\nUniversity Guide\n\nThe Crime Desk\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nMonday, Oct 27th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJamaica to be hit by 'worst ever hurricane': Hundreds of holidaymakers are locked down in hotels as Hurricane Melissa barrels towards island with 40 inches of rain expected to hit in 24 hours\n\nVenezuela 'captures CIA agents' amid fears of all-out war as GOP senator warns Trump's boat strikes set chilling precedent\n\nPolish 'stalker' who claimed she was Madeleine McCann breaks down in court after telling how she remembered being 'taken, abused and held with other girls'\n\nI was only 35 but felt 55.

Email adam.pogrund@dailymail.co.uk \nBy FREYA BARNES, NEWS REPORTER and ADAM POGRUND, TRAINEE REPORTER\n Published:23:35 GMT, 27 October 2025 |Updated:23:35 GMT, 27 October 2025 \n\nNew footage has emerged showing the protester who heckled King Charles over Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein's relationship being pulled back by a bystander.\nThe anti-monarchy protester - from the campaign group Republic - shouted questions about the Prince and convicted sex trafficker Epstein as the King visited Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire. \nThe heckler's identity remains unknown but a new angle of the outburst shows him being pulled back by a frustrated onlooker as he launched the tirade. \nThe furious demonstrator, a brown haired man who was wearing a green jacket and holding his phone to record the King, was jeered by crowds after he yelled at the monarch. \nAs the King walked past, the protester shouted: 'How long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\n'Have you asked the police to cover up for Andrew?\n'Should MPs be allowed to debate the royals in the House of Commons?'\nThe King chose to ignore the heckler, showing no reaction while other people outside Lichfield Cathedral told the heckler to 'shut up' as the King made his way through the crowd, greeting fans and tuning out the chaos.\n\nNew footage has emerged showing the protester who heckled King Charles over Prince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein 's relationship\n\nThe furious brown haired man can be seen wearing a green jacket and holding his phone to record the King \n\nOther people outside Lichfield Cathedral told the heckler to 'shut up' as the King made his way through the crowd, greeting fans and tuning out the chaos\nIt comes as the King faces mounting pressure to kick his brother out of his Royal Lodge home where he has lived rent-free for over 20 years.\nAndrew has only paid 'peppercorn' rent for the last 20 years, and while he initially tried to dig his heels in by citing the terms of his 'cast iron' lease with the Crown Estate, it is understood he will finally move out.\nThe prince still has 50 years left on his pre-paid lease and it not known exactly how much money he could receive in compensation for the £7.5million he has spent on Royal Lodge renovations.\nOn Sunday night, it was claimed Andrew and Fergie have finally agreed to leave their sprawling mansion - but have demanded two homes in return.\nThe 65-year-old is said to have requested Harry and Meghan's former home, Frogmore Cottage, while Fergie is eyeing up nearby Adelaide Cottage ahead of William and Kate's departure next month.\nThe Prince's links to Epstein have dominated headlines recently with fresh focus on his sex accuser Virginia Giuffre's claims after her posthumous book was published.\nLast week, The Mail on Sunday revealed that Andrew tried to involve the Metropolitan Police and one of Queen Elizabeth's most senior aides in a campaign to smear Virginia Giuffre, who had accused him of assaulting her as a teenager.\nA bombshell email obtained exposed how Andrew asked his taxpayer-funded police bodyguard to investigate the 'lying' young woman.\n\nThe King was heckled as he greeted people in the crowd who had lined up behind metal barriers outside Lichfield Cathedral\n\nIn line with the Royal family's usual response to unwanted questions or criticism - never complain, never explain - the King chose to ignore the heckler, showing no reaction (Pictured: The King inside Lichfield Cathedral in Staffordshire)\nShockingly, the prince passed on details of her date of birth and social security number, presumably given to him by Epstein.\nHe also claimed Virginia, who took her own life earlier this year, had criminal convictions, a claim which has not been backed up by any evidence or confirmed by police and has been strongly denied by her family.\nAn earlier email exposé proved that Andrew lied to Buckingham Palace and the British public when he claimed he had cut off all contact with his close friend in December 2010, following Epstein's release from prison on child-sex charges.\nTwelve weeks later, he emailed the paedophile financier to say they were 'in this together' and sickeningly expressed his wish to 'play some more soon'.\nHis ex wife Sarah Ferguson, who has also been living in Royal Lodge, came under fire in recent weeks as astonishing new emails claimed Epstein had secretly bankrolled her for 15 years.\nThe convicted paedophile complained to friends about the disgraced duchess's scrounging ways in messages that suggest his financial support went far beyond the £15,000 she admitted taking from him.\nIn the previously unseen emails, Epstein reveals Fergie was so desperate to cosy up to him that 'she was the first to celebrate' his release from jail 'with her two daughters in tow'. Princess Beatrice would have been 20 at the time and Eugenie 19, the same age as many of his victims.\nThe shocking claims are contained in a huge tranche of documents under review by the US Congress. They are set to be released once they have been redacted to protect the identity of hundreds of young girls Epstein raped and sexually abused.\nLast month, the MoS revealed how Fergie wrote to Epstein calling him a 'supreme friend', just weeks after giving an interview claiming she would 'never have anything to do with' the sex offender ever again – reviving the scandal that saw her and Andrew relinquish their titles on Friday.\n\nPrince Andrew and his ex-wife Sarah Ferguson (pictured in 2019) are facing increased scrutiny over their friendship with Jeffrey Epstein\n\nIt comes as the King faces mounting pressure to kick his brother out of his Royal Lodge home (pictured) where he has lived rent-free for over 20 years \nIn the London Evening Standard interview of March 7, 2011 Fergie issued a 'heartfelt apology' for accepting £15,000 from Epstein and called it 'a giant error of judgment'.\nThe comment angered the financier, who sent an email to his friend, French modelling agent Jean-Luc Brunel, that day, complaining: 'The duchess that I have financially helped for 15 years said that she wants nothing to do with a paedophile and child sex abuser. It has caused quite a stir.'\nBrunel was later arrested on rape charges and killed himself in jail in 2022, three years after Epstein's own jail suicide.\nEpstein demanded Fergie write him a public letter of apology over the interview and threatened to sue her if she did not.\nIn Ms Giuffre's posthumous memoir, she claimed Prince Andrew remarked that Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie were 'just a little younger than you' on the first night they allegedly had sex.\nOn the day Ms Giuffre says she met the prince in March 2001, Maxwell woke her up at her London townhouse and told her she was going to have a 'special day' and 'just like Cinderella' she would meet a 'handsome prince'.\nWhen Andrew arrived, Maxwell told him to guess her age. The prince, then 41, 'guessed correctly' that she was 17, she recalled, and he added: 'My daughters are just a little younger than you.'\nMs Giuffre said she remembered running for her disposable camera to snap the now infamous picture of her with Andrew – saying that 'my mom would never forgive me if I met someone as famous as Prince Andrew and didn't pose for a picture'. The prince has repeatedly denied her claims.\n\nPrince Andrew and Jeffrey Epstein pictured together in Central Park in 2011 \n\nVirginia Giuffre photographed with Prince Andrew and Ghislaine Maxwell in London in 2001 \nLater that night, Ms Giuffre claimed she went to Tramp nightclub with Andrew, Epstein and Maxwell, where the prince 'sweated profusely' – despite him later insisting a medical condition made this impossible. Maxwell instructed her: 'When we get home, you are to do for him what you do for Jeffrey.'\nMs Giuffre doubled down on her claim she and Andrew had a bath together.\nShe wrote: 'We didn't stay there long because the prince was eager to get to the bed. Afterward, he said thank you in his clipped British accent. In my memory, the whole thing lasted less than half an hour.'\nShe added: 'He was friendly enough, but still entitled – as if he believed having sex with me was his birthright.'\nEpstein later gave her $15,000 'for servicing the man the tabloids called \"Randy Andy\",' she said.\nMs Giuffre repeated her fiercely denied claim that Andrew took part in an orgy with her and 'approximately eight other young girls' on Epstein's Caribbean island of Little St James, known as 'Paedo Island', in 2001.\nShe wrote: 'It was not just the two of us this time; it was an orgy. The other girls all seemed and appeared to be under the age of 18, and didn't really speak English. Epstein laughed about how they couldn't really communicate, saying they are the easiest girls to get along with.'\n\nFergie pictured with Princess Eugenie (L) and Princess Beatrice (R), at a film premiere in 2009\n\nThe convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein reportedly claimed he bankrolled the former duchess for 15 years (Pictured in 2017 in prison mugshot)\nAndrew has always strenuously denied Ms Giuffre's claims.\nPrince Andrew insisted Ms Giuffre sign a gagging order – so he did not embarrass the late Queen during her Platinum Jubilee celebrations in 2022, the book claims.\nAfter Ms Giuffre launched a court action against the prince for alleged rape and emotional distress, she was paid a reported £10million in a settlement in which the prince did not admit any wrongdoing. He has consistently and vehemently denied all her claims.\nMs Giuffre said she agreed to stay silent for at least one year, as part of the settlement, saying it 'seemed important to the prince because it ensured that his mother's Platinum Jubilee would not be tarnished'.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNew video emerges of King Charles heckler being pulled by bystander after he yelled at monarch about Prince Andrew \n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

We can't wait to keep dancing with you.'\nHis other child, Miah, continued: 'Thank you Daddy for stepping out of your comfort zone for us - you're absolutely amazing.' Meanwhile, youngest daughter Khloe added: 'Well done, Daddy.'\nFinishing the message, Natalie added: 'And Lauren, thank you for bringing out this new and fun side of Jimmy.'\nThis left Strictly pro Lauren wiping her tears away and she confessed: 'It was setting her off already'.\nWhen asked what his family made of his time on the show, Jimmy explained: 'That was emotional. They are really happy - they have been so supportive.\n'Obviously, they were very sad after Saturday but very proud. It's family time, it's bringing everybody together and to see them and to see that message, I've got no words.'\nBefore his performance, Jimmy revealed that he had been left 'frustrated and angry' over a mistake he was continually making during rehearsals.\nJimmy confessed that he 'complicates things' every time he tries to learn the steps.\n\nAfter the clip Strictly pro Lauren wiped her tears away and she confessed: 'It was setting her off already'\n\nWhen Jimmy, who achieved his highest score of the competition on Saturday, was voted off he said he had ‘absolutely loved’ his time on the show\nHe said: 'The first hit, I do them, and then after the third time trying, I complicate things, and I end up thinking too much about it and overcomplicating it, and then getting frustrated with myself and getting angry.\n'So, it's a process that I just need to get out of. I don't know what it is, but I haven't cracked it yet in my head.\n\n Strictly star Amber Davies confesses she is feeling like 'trash' after a 'gut-wrenching' dance off \n'So, it's a process that I just need to get out of. I don't know what it is, but I haven't cracked it yet in my head.\n'I think it's just because it's not natural, it's not a day-to-day thing, it's a new discipline.\n'And you can just see my face changing and my demeanour shifting. I just get really upset with myself.'\nWhen Jimmy, who achieved his highest score of the competition on Saturday, was voted off he said he had ‘absolutely loved’ his time on the show.\nHe then added: ‘The only thing you can do is dance as best as you can and then it’s up to the public.\n'I was actually quite happy to dance again because I wanted to do better than my previous one.\n'So listen, I have had a blast. From the people up there [pointing to the other couples], to the judges – thank you very much for your comments.’\nHis professional dance partner, Lauren, said she was ‘gutted’ about his exit and added: ‘We have had the best time and I am so proud of how far he has come.\n'And it proves that anyone can be a dancer if you put your mind to it. He’s a footballer! And he just danced like that.\n‘We’ve had the best time and I’m just so proud and I feel honoured to have been able to teach you. You’ve been an amazing student.’\nIt comes after presenters Tess Daly and Claudia Winkleman announced they will depart the show at the end of the series.\nClaudia, 53, said: 'We thank you for your beautiful messages. We've got another eight weeks on this incredible show and a Strictly champion to crown.'\nTess, 56, added: 'We cannot wait to spend the rest of the series with you and our incredible couples.'\nThe remaining ten couples will take to the dancefloor for a Halloween special, when Strictly Come Dancing returns to BBC One on Saturday 1 November at 6.35pm\nJimmy Floyd HasselbainkNikita KuzminAmber Davies\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nStrictly Come Dancing star Lauren Oakley is reduced to tears after Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's family send an emotional message after his exit\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy LAURA CRAIK \n Published:22:02 GMT, 27 October 2025 |Updated:22:17 GMT, 27 October 2025 \n\nTechnically, it was a reproduction of the garment worn by actress Rita Hayworth in the 1946 Hollywood film Gilda. Symbolically, it had a different meaning altogether. \nWhen Nicole Kidman took to the catwalk as guest – and model – of honour at a Hollywood-themed Vogue extravaganza on Sunday, it was hard not to interpret her strapless black Chanel gown as a very glamorous revenge dress.\nFor if living well is the best revenge, dressing well is surely a very close second. \nWhen Princess Diana stepped out in a little black off-shoulder dress by Christina Stambolian on the night that Charles publicly admitted his infidelity, she immediately changed the narrative, going from ‘victim’ to ‘vixen’.\nAnd while there’s no suggestion infidelity is behind the shock split between Kidman, 58, and her husband Keith Urban, also 58, reports that she was ‘blindsided’ have led some to paint her as the ‘victim’.\nDespite announcing their separation at the end of September, the former power couple have continued to follow each other on Instagram.\n\nTechnically, the dress worn by Nicole Kidman at Vogue World was a reproduction of the garment worn by Rita Hayworth in the film Gilda. Symbolically, it had a different meaning\n\nHayworth wears an identical gown while starring in the 1946 Hollywood film (pictured)\nNicole currently follows just 372 people on the platform - and Keith remains one of them.\nLikewise, the country music star follows only 115 accounts, with Nicole still included among his select list.\nNevertheless, it takes more than a little black dress to fix a marriage – even if that dress is by Chanel. \nBut as ego boosts go, there could be few as effective, or public, as Kidman’s starring role in Vogue World: Hollywood – she both opened and closed the 30-minute show. \nKendall Jenner was another of the catwalk models, wearing the original costume worn by Kidman’s character, Satine, in the 2001 film Moulin Rouge!\nThe show was also choreographed by the film’s director, Baz Luhrmann. Now in its fourth year, Vogue World turns the normally private sphere of the fashion show into public entertainment, selling tickets with proceeds going to charity.\nWhile last year’s event was held in Paris as a preface to the Olympics, this year’s took place in Paramount Pictures’ studio lot in Los Angeles, in keeping with its theme of celebrating the love affair between fashion and film.\nHollywood’s great and good showed up to lend their support, many on the catwalk too, including actresses Angela Bassett and Julia Garner.\n\nWhen Nicole took to the catwalk as guest of honour at the Vogue extravaganza on Sunday, it was hard not to interpret her strapless black Chanel gown as a very glamorous revenge dress\n\nWhile there’s no suggestion infidelity is behind the shock split between Kidman and her husband Keith Urban, reports that she was ‘blindsided’ have led some to paint her as ‘victim’\nGuests included actresses Gwyneth Paltrow, Dakota Johnson, Cynthia Erivo and Viola Davis, as well as singer Miley Cyrus, tennis ace Venus Williams, model Heidi Klum, and Brooklyn and Nicola Peltz Beckham.\nBut if the evening was a validation of sorts for Kidman, it was equally so for Dame Anna Wintour, 75, who recently stepped down as Vogue’s editor-in-chief after almost 40 years at the magazine’s helm, though she remains its global editorial director.\nThe event was a neat reminder of her formidable ability to persuade fashion and film’s biggest players to come together for a good cause.\nAccording to parent company Conde Nast, a total of £3.4million was raised for costume designers affected by the Los Angeles wildfires earlier this year. \n\nIt takes more than a little black dress to fix a marriage – even if that dress is by Chanel\nChanelNicole Kidman\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nNicole Kidman the Hollywood bombshell is a double for sex siren Rita Hayworth as she models reproduction of legendary dress at Vogue World\n\nAdd comment\n\nComments 25\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

SIX months after the baby was born\n\nHave YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SHARON MAI, ENTERTAINMENT REPORTER \n Published:21:33 GMT, 27 October 2025 |Updated:21:38 GMT, 27 October 2025 \n\nJennifer Lawrence revealed the gender of her second child as she opened up about her postpartum anxiety battle after giving birth earlier this year.\nThe 35-year-old actress welcomed her second baby, now over six months old, in March with her husband, art gallery director Cooke Maroney, 41.\nWhile talking about her new film, the movie adaptation of Ariana Harwicz's novel Die, My Love, produced by Martin Scorsese, she revealed she welcomed a second son — whose name is rumored to be Louie.\nNow as a mother to two boys, she opened up about her ongoing postpartum experience since giving birth to her infant son half a year ago.\nShe said that with the birth of her first child Cy in February 2022, she 'wasn't really having a bad postpartum.' \nIn contrast, she told The New Yorker in an interview published on Monday: 'I had a worse postpartum with my second, but the first time the only thing I was at war with was the rest of the world.'\n\nJennifer Lawrence revealed the gender of her second child and opened up about her postpartum anxiety battle after giving birth earlier this year\n\n'I just thought every time he was sleeping he was dead,' the Oscar winner said. \n'I thought he cried because he didn’t like his life, or me, or his family. I thought I was doing everything wrong, and that I would ruin my children.' \nLawrence said she was prescribed Zurzuvae, a recently developed drug, to help with her postpartum anxiety. \nShe recounted a story about crying while asking ChatGPT a question about breastfeeding, and said the kind response from AI chatbot made her more anxious and doubt herself even more.\n'You're doing the most amazing thing for your baby. You're such a loving mother,' it had told her, but she said that a robot would tell her that made her question the sincerity of other people who said the same thing to her.\nDuring the same interview, the No Hard Feelings star talked about her longtime battle with anxiety.\n'I feel like I am driven by anxiety,' she shared at one point. 'When I was a kid, I soothed my anxiety by trying to be good, trying to do the right thing, so that I wouldn't upset God or my parents.'\nJournalist Jia Tolentino also 'mostly jokingly' asked Lawrence about what cosmetic procedures she has undergone in the interview before the star answered honestly. \n\nShe said that with the birth of her first child Cy in February 2022, she 'wasn't really having a bad postpartum.' In contrast, she told The New Yorker in an interview published on Monday: 'I had a worse postpartum with my second; pictured in November 2024\n\nWhile talking about her new film, the movie adaptation of Ariana Harwicz's novel Die, My Love, produced by Martin Scorsese , she revealed she welcomed a second son — whose name is rumored to be Louie\n\n Jennifer Lawrence steps out with her parents after celebrating sixth wedding anniversary \nThe Hunger Games alum said she she has not gotten fillers because they 'show on camera' but she gets Botox — just a little so she can still 'use her forehead and play people who don't have access to celebrity dermatology.'\nWhen asked if she'd gotten a facelift, she replied: 'No, but believe me, I'm gonna!' \nThis comes after she seemingly revealed her second child's name on accident during an outing in New York City in early September. \nShe was spotted carrying a beaded keychain with her first son's name Cy and another that read 'Louie,' the rumored moniker of her second baby. \nThe actress first announced her second pregnancy publicly when her representative confirmed the news to Vogue in an article published in October 2024. \nThe Kentucky native and Cooke married in October 2019 at the Belcourt mansion in Newport, Rhode Island. \n\nThe 35-year-old actress welcomed her second baby, now six months old, in March with her husband, art gallery director Cooke Maroney, 41; pictured in May 2021\n\n Jennifer Lawrence reveals the revolting dish she served Robert Pattinson \nMaroney has worked as the art gallery director for Gladstone Gallery in New York City since 2022. \nLast October, an insider teased to People magazine that JLaw's son Cy 'will be 3 when the new baby arrives.'\n'She loves being a mom. She’s thrilled to be pregnant again. It feels like the perfect timing to her. Her son will 3 when the new baby arrives,' they added. \nIn a 2022 interview with Vogue, Lawrence opened up about the joy of becoming a first-time mother, sharing that the birth of her son Cy 'felt like my whole life had started over.' \n'I just stared. I was just so in love. I also fell in love with all babies everywhere. Newborns are just so amazing,' she gushed. \nElsewhere in the conversation, she described, 'I mean the euphoria of Cy is just — Jesus, it's impossible. My heart has stretched to a capacity that I didn't know about. I include my husband in that.' \nChatGPTJennifer LawrenceMartin Scorsese\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nJennifer Lawrence FINALLY reveals the gender of her second child...

The anchor slammed CBS’s then owner Paramount in an on-air tirade this summer for inking a $16 million settlement with President Trump over allegations that “60 Minutes” “deceptively edited a Kamala Harris interview.\n\nLikewise, Bill Whitaker, the correspondent who conducted the controversial Harris interview, may also be in the crosshairs after he was criticized for throwing softball questions and not vetting what was aired, sources said.\n\n“Bari isn’t wrong to try to bring in new people,” said a CBS source, noting that Pelley and Whitaker are 68 and 74, respectively. “Most of the show’s correspondents and its viewers are geriatric.”\n\nNevertheless, insiders say the furious guessing game that has erupted over Weiss’s prospective ax sharpening isn’t so simple. \n\nFor example, 83-year-old Lesley Stahl — who last year rebuffed President Trump’s demand that she apologize for dismissing The Post’s Hunter Biden laptop story — is said to be thought of as a “treasure” by Weiss and may keep her role for some time longer, despite retirement rumors, according to a source. \n\nAnother major question mark is how Tanya Simon – who succeeded Bill Owens as “60 Minutes” executive producer in a tumultuous, Trump-related reshuffle this summer – will fit into Weiss’s new regime, according to insiders.\n\nSimon — the daughter of late correspondent Bob Simon — appears to agree with Weiss that the show has “gone soft,” according to a well-placed source. Before Weiss’s arrival, Simon already had been looking to shuffle personnel to make the show “more hard hitting” and cut back on “soft entertainment pieces,” the source said.\n\nNeither Simon nor a rep for “60 Minutes” commented. \n\n“’60 Minutes’ has become the headquarters of book and movie launches,” an insider told The Post. “It is not the home of the investigative journalism of Mike Wallace anymore.”\n\n“60 Minutes” has had some strong reports last year, such as its Emmy Award-winning investigation on “Havana Syndrome.” But the the current season opened last month with a lightweight piece on Utah Gov. Spencer Cox calling for unity after Charlie Kirk’s murder and a puffy sit-down with UFC head Dana White, the source griped.\n\nIn a segment on Sunday, correspondent Cecilia Vega interviewed mentalist Oz Pearlman, who guessed the name of Vega’s third-grade teacher.\n\n“This reporting is afternoon cable fare,” a CBS source scoffed. “It is not ’60 Minutes’ caliber.”\n\nThe overhaul comes as Weiss and CBS News president Tom Cibrowski are mulling whether to purge big names like “CBS Mornings” co-host Gayle King, whose eight-figure salary is hard to justify for the third-place show. Meanwhile, the network is expected to announce major headcount reductions Wednesday.\n\n“Big changes are coming,” said a source with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe person added that Weiss is focused on bringing back hard-hitting investigations — long part of CBS News’ DNA. Weiss has reportedly reached out to former CBS News investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge, who famously clashed with the network’s bosses as she broke stories on Hunter Biden’s laptop.\n\n“There’s not much of an investigative reporting unit anymore,” said a CBS News exec. “The reality is ‘60 Minutes’ is the investigative arm of CBS News.”\n\nOn Monday, the network confirmed that “CBS Evening News” co-anchor John Dickerson – who sources say is earning a couple million annually – would be retiring at the end of the year. Insiders expect his co-host Maurice DuBois to follow suit as Weiss and Cibrowski identify who would be best to anchor the show.","summary":"CBS News editor in chief Bari Weiss is looking to shake up the iconic TV news magazine -- and casualties could include any number of the show's star anchors, The Post has learned.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/10/27/media/cbs-news-boss-bari-weiss-eyes-major-shakeup-at-60-minutes-sources/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/10/114312004.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Ogw9rgDG-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-27 21:37:01","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":373166032,"title":"Travis Kelce joined Taylor Swift in ALSO shaking off Kamala Harris","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris' doomed presidential campaign didn't just get rebuffed by pop star Taylor Swift - who never joined the Democratic nominee on the campaign trail - but it was rejected by Swift's fiancé, Travis Kelce, as well. \n\nIn his new book, Retribution, ABC News' Jonathan Karl charted the 'increasingly desperate' ways in which Harris' campaign tried to shake up the trajectory of the 2024 race. \n\nThe Daily Mail obtained an early copy of Karl's book. \n\nAfter the initial Democratic excitement for the party's new nominee, following President Joe Biden's exit from the race in July, Harris' advisers feared that President Donald Trump had built up an insurmountable lead in the final weeks. \n\nSo they decided to think outside the box. \n\nKarl reported that Harris' team reached out to the New Heights podcast helmed by Travis Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs, and his brother Jason, a retired Philadelphia Eagle. \n\n'The Kelce brothers, however, rejected the offer, even though Travis’s girlfriend, Taylor Swift, had endorsed Harris weeks earlier,' Karl wrote. 'Their producer explained they do sports, not politics.' \n\nSwift's endorsement of Harris - which came following her strong debate performance against Trump on September 10 - had surprised the vice president's campaign team. \n\n'Neither Harris nor anyone on her campaign had any idea Swift's endorsement -arguably the biggest one she could get - was coming,' Karl wrote. \n\n'If they had, they would have asked her to hold off for a day or two,' he continued. 'Coming when it did, the news could only do one of two things: get buried by Harris' dominant debate performance or distract from it.'\n\nAs Harris headed to Philadelphia's Cherry Street Pier to address supporters at a watch party, her campaign quickly had to decide how she should handle the Swift news. \n\nThey did so with just a slight nod. \n\nHarris and Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff exited the stage to Swift's 'The Man.' \n\nThe crowd ate it up - with the expectation that Swift would eventually join the Democratic nominee on the campaign trail, maybe even help her in the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania, where the pop star was born and spent her early years.\n\nBut Swift never showed. \n\n'The Harris campaign team tried to reach out to the pop star. Maybe she could appear in a campaign ad? Maybe she could perform at a campaign event? There were many possibilities - after all, Swift was massively popular with an important group of voters who could help Harris win the election: young women,' Karl wrote.\n\n'But the Harris campaign got no answer,' he continued. 'They couldn't even get a response from Taylor Swift's spokesperson, Trina \"Tree\" Paine, sending her several messages but never receiving an answer.'\n\nPaine did not immediately respond to the Daily Mail's request for comment. \n\nIn the book 2024: How Trump Retook the White House and the Democrats Lost America, journalists Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf wrote that Emhoff, who was a prominent Los Angeles-based entertainment lawyer, had tried to use his connections to get Swift involved in his wife's campaign. \n\n'Swift proved to be a special challenge. Staffers who worked on celebrity appearances were instructed not to make any outreach to her universe; Doug Emhoff was handling it,' the authors wrote. \n\nEmhoff reached out to Swift's lawyer, Doug Baldridge, as they were both partners at the law firm Venable, to 'convey that the campaign would appreciate any efforts the pop star could make to help Harris.' \n\nIn a brutal seven-word rejection, Baldridge said: 'Swift would do what Swift thought best.' \n\nSwift has never publicly explained why she decided not to join Harris at any campaign appearances. \n\nKarl's book Retribution will be released Tuesday.","summary":"Kamala Harris ' doomed presidential campaign didn't just get rebuffed by pop star Taylor Swift - who never joined her on the campaign trail - but it was rejected by Swift's fiancé, Travis Kelce , as well.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15229955/travis-kelce-kamala-harris-campaign.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/27/05/103338077-0-image-m-17_1761542255242.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 21:29:06","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.372},{"id":373156876,"title":"Donald Trump third term as US President: Republican says he ‘would love’ to run, fuelling wild speculation","text":"US President Donald Trump is doing little, potentially the least, to quash speculation he could seek a third-term presidency, something the US Constitution forbids.\n\nOn Monday, while travelling to Japan on Air Force One, Mr Trump spoke about his “best poll” numbers and that he “would love” to run in 2028, and took to Truth Social to again claim he won the 2020 US presidential election, the election former US President Joe Biden won.\n\n“Am I not ruling it out? You’ll have to tell me, Mr Trump told reporters who asked him if he would run in 2028.\n\n“I have the best poll numbers I’ve ever had.\n\n“I’ve just solved eight wars and a ninth is coming. I believe Russia-Ukraine will happen.\n\n“When you look at the treaty we just did (Thailand-Cambodia), that was a war. Thousands of people were already shot at the border.\n\n“If you look at what we just did, it was pretty amazing.”\n\nSpeaking about ending wars, something Mr Trump said made him “feel good”, the US President gave thanks to the Malaysian Prime Minister for his role in securing the peace deal between Thailand and Cambodia.\n\nIf Trump doesn’t run in 2028, who would?\n\nTalking about “great” Republican people, Mr Trump named US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and US Vice President JD Vance, saying he was not sure “if anyone would run against us”, in a 2028 US presidential election.\n\nHe named multiple Democrats that he speculates could consider running, saying they have “low IQ”.\n\nMr Trump also mentioned a recent MRI he had as part of his yearly health check-up, saying his result was “perfect”.\n\n“If I didn’t think it was going to be good.... I wouldn’t run. I’d do something, but... the doctors said some of the best reports for the age. some of the best reports they’ve ever seen,” Mr Trump said.\n\nTrump rules out running as Vice President\n\nMr Trump said he “would be allowed” to run for the vice presidency in another election, a popular theory amongst those speculating he may try and stay in the White House. However, on this occasion, Mr Trump ruled that option out.\n\n“I wouldn’t do it. I think it’s too cute. I would rule that out. I don’t think the people would like that. It’s too cute.”\n\nCan Donald Trump run for a third term?\n\nSince before his reelection, Mr Trump has fanned the flames of rumoured theories that he will try and stay in the White House longer than many think he is welcome.\n\nIn the past, only one US President has served more than two terms. Franklin D. Roosevelt served four terms between 1933 and 1945.\n\nHis historic 12-year hold over the White House saw Congress pass the 22nd amendment of the United States Constitution, with a change limiting a US President to just two terms.\n\nSection one of the amendment says: “No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.”\n\nSome speculate Mr Trump could find another way to get around the two-term limit.\n\nThe US Constitution can be changed. However, doing so, to change the limit on presidential terms, would require support from the Senate, the House of Representatives and three-quarters of state-level governments.\n\nAlthough Republicans hold the House and the Senate, they do not have the numbers needed to push through the change without Democrat support.\n\nSome Trump advisers have said Mr Trump will be the US President in 2028; however, they say they will only reveal this at an “appropriate time.”\n\nWho could run as Democratic presidential nominee in 2028?\n\nAlthough Mr Trump’s comments about politicians not wanting to run against Republicans in a 2028 US Presidential election are likely humour, a clear front runner to lead the Democrats remains in limbo.\n\nMr Trump’s comments come after former US Vice President, and 2024 Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris told the BBC “I’m not done”.\n\n“I have lived my entire career a life of service and it’s in my bones. And there are many ways to serve,” she said.\n\n“I’ve never listened to polls.”\n\n“If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office - and I certainly wouldn’t be sitting here.”\n\nOther than Ms Harris, Democrat names including California Governor Gavin Newsom, former US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg and US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Governor of Pennsylvania Josh Shapiro continue to have their names ran amongst the rumour mill.","summary":"US President Donald Trump is doing little, potentially the least, to quash speculation he will seek a third-term presidency.

Board documents did not state a reason for Hayes’ recusal.\n\n“Ms. Rollins wants to express her appreciation to the Office of Bar Counsel for its discretion and professionalism throughout this entire process, and is appreciative that this administrative matter has finally concluded,” Jeffrey Robbins, an attorney for Rollins, said Monday in a statement.\n\n“She is grateful to remain a lawyer in good standing, committed to public service, and looks forward to continuing to serve the community she loves,” he added.\n\nThe public reprimand came two years after Rollins resigned in disgrace from her former position as Massachusetts U.S. Attorney. She stepped down amid an ethics scandal revealed during a federal investigation.\n\nA Mass BBO representative told the Herald that the board’s written decision was in the process of being prepared and would not be available on Monday.\n\nPrior board records provided to the Herald by Rollins’ attorney last month shed light on the misconduct violation that led to the public reprimand.\n\nThe disclosure that Rollins was disciplined for came three days after Suffolk DA Kevin Hayden won the primary against her preferred candidate, ex-City Councilor Ricardo Arroyo. The Herald held off on publishing damaging information Rollins had been leaking to the Boston Globe and Herald about Hayden until after the primary.\n\nThe documents, signed June 30, show Rollins agreed to a public reprimand for misconduct without a hearing. The Mass BBO website now reflects the reprimand under Rollins’ public discipline information.\n\nDisciplinary proceedings are generally triggered by allegations of misconduct against an attorney, which could lead to disbarment, resignation, or suspension by the court, public reprimand by the board, or admonition by the bar counsel, according to Supreme Judicial Court Rule 4:01 for Bar Discipline.\n\nRollins resigned as U.S. Attorney in May 2023 after being scorched in two federal reports that found she abused her position, in part, by leaking false information to the media in an effort to influence the outcome of the Suffolk District Attorney’s race in favor of her preferred candidate, Arroyo, who lost the primary to Hayden.\n\nBoard of Bar Overseers documents released last month detail how Rollins sought to damage Hayden’s reputation after his primary win by leaking a sensitive Department of Justice document to the Herald about a possible criminal investigation into Hayden’s handling of a police misconduct case, and her office’s recusal from the matter.\n\nThe alleged police misconduct case began under Rollins’ tenure as Suffolk DA. Hayden was appointed interim Suffolk DA after Rollins was appointed U.S. Attorney, which was narrowly confirmed by the U.S. Senate with then-Vice President Kamala Harris casting the tie-breaking vote.\n\n“When the respondent disclosed the recusal memorandum to the Herald reporter, she erroneously thought she had discretion to disclose the matter without prior authorization,” the board’s documents state.\n\nThe documents also show Rollins sent a deceptive text message to her colleagues at the Department of Justice after a Herald article appeared quoting the confidential document she had leaked, “in order to avoid suspicion that she was the source of the leaked recusal memorandum.”\n\nThe same instances of serious misconduct were flagged in the two scathing federal reports that led to Rollins’ resignation two years ago.\n\nThe Boston Globe ran pre-primary stories leaked by Rollins that were damaging to Hayden, who ran unopposed in the general election after defeating Arroyo.\n\nThe Herald received similar information but didn’t publish until after the primary, one of the federal reports points out.\n\nThe two Department of Justice reports stated that Rollins faced further discipline from the feds if she did not promptly quit.\n\nThe federal investigation was sparked by Rollins’ appearance at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser headlined by then-First Lady Jill Biden, in potential violation of the Hatch Act, after it was first reported by the Herald.","summary":"The state’s Board of Bar Overseers voted to issue a public reprimand for misconduct to disgraced former U.S. Attorney Rachael Rollins, but three members of the board dissented, preferring to reject the penalty as \"too lenient.\"","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/10/27/disgraced-former-us-attorney-rachael-rollins-issued-public-reprimand-by-state-bar-board/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/ROLLINSsc-002.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 21:04:08","author":"Gayla Cawley","authors":["Gayla Cawley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.278},{"id":373174344,"title":"Why Biden’s White House Press Secretary Is Leaving the Democratic Party","text":"I recently spoke by phone with Jean-Pierre. During our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, we discussed why she believes Biden should have stayed on as the candidate in 2024, her surprising feelings about Kamala Harris, and whether Biden was getting accurate information about the state of his campaign against Trump.\nYou feel like you had to leave the Democratic Party because of the way it treated Joe Biden. How did it treat Joe Biden?\nI call it a betrayal. And the reason I say this, and I really want people to understand my perspective and where I come from and the role that I played in those three weeks—from the debate to the President deciding that he was no longer going to be at the top of the ticket and handing over the baton—is that I was the person who was standing on that podium behind that lectern, having to take in all the hard questions on this. Rightfully so. And I was watching what Democratic leadership was doing. It was an all-out, full-on campaign to embarrass him, to push him out. And I just thought to myself, Wow, you don’t have that much time left this election year. And I thought to myself, This man is one of the most decent people that I know. And objectively, objectively, it was a good Presidency. Some have even said he did more in one term than most Presidents do in two. So I just didn’t understand why this was happening.\nYou lay out very clearly why you think Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. And, at the same time, you are suggesting that what happened in those three weeks was so serious that you had to leave the Democratic Party, even at this moment of grave threat. You said that the Party was trying to undermine Biden. What do you think they were doing and why?\nWell, I mean, I just laid it out. I just said that there was an obvious campaign. You just had to watch.\nSure, but why were they doing that?\nBecause they believed that he needed to step aside. There’s more to this than just that period of time. This is very layered, right? There’s a period of time that I questioned what was happening and how do we treat our own, how do we treat people who are decent people? And then you also have to think about how I’m thinking about this as a Black woman who is part of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, and living in this time where I also don’t think Democrats right now, Democrats’ leadership, is protecting vulnerable people in the way that it should.\nSorry, I’m not trying to be dense. I’m a little unclear about what this has to do with Democratic leaders and many Democrats in the country thinking that Joe Biden was going to lose to Donald Trump—which was what the polls all showed—and therefore thinking that he should be replaced.\nO.K., wait a minute. Hold on a second. Nobody knows anything. Nobody knows what would’ve happened. People also thought that if you replace Joe Biden we were going to win, or have a better chance of winning. Millions of people who showed up in 2020 didn’t show up in 2024. We can’t forget that there was an incumbency issue as well. This is real. There are, like, several G-10 countries with incumbents who did not get reëlected. There was an incumbency issue as well.\nI’m not sure what you’re saying.\nNo, no, no. Wait a minute. You are saying that this was their thinking, and they were kind of predicting. But nobody knew what was going to happen. Nobody knew that Joe Biden was going to win in 2020. Nobody knew what was going to happen in 2024. People believed in their hearts that Kamala was going to win. They believed it. They saw the polling and they thought she was going to win, looking at the polling. Nobody knew anything. I’m only bringing up the polls because you brought up the polls to me.\nYou said you were speaking as a Black woman who’s part of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, and I think people were very—\nI’m talking about in this moment, too. I do not feel seen in the Party because I think they’re throwing the L.G.B.T.Q. community under the bus. They’re not fighting enough for migrants and immigrants. You have to be a big-tent party. You have to fight for everyone.\nI’m just still trying to understand. You argue that Donald Trump is a threat to democracy. A lot of people thought that Biden was not the best person to go up against Trump in the summer of 2024—after his debate, with his approval ratings in the basement. Shouldn’t those people have tried to give Democrats the best chance to replace Trump? You’re talking about Biden like loyalty was owed to him. Isn’t loyalty owed to the country?\nNo, that’s not what I’m saying. I’m not talking about that. I’m saying that this is not how you treat somebody.\nIs this a matter of how you treat someone, or a matter of putting the country first?\nWait a minute, wait a minute. Treating somebody with dignity is not the same as loyalty. I mean, the way he was treated, I had never . . . if you had seen something like that in the Democratic Party, please, please, point that out.\nSo what was an example of the way he was treated?\nI mean, it was nasty articles that were coming out daily. You should go back and see for yourself. You’re writing the articles, right? You should go back and see for yourself. It was a campaign. It was even reported that it was a campaign.\nSo you think asking him to step aside was O.K., but there shouldn’t have been nasty articles?\nLook, what I am saying is it shouldn’t have happened that way.\nBut it should have happened, or shouldn’t have happened?\nWait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I don’t think it should have happened. I believe that we should have done everything that we could, regardless of who was at the top of the ticket, and fought extremely hard. He was the one at the top of the ticket, and so, therefore, I believe we should have fought to make sure that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won. That’s what I believed.\nWhen he decided to run in 2023, we have to also remember what was happening at that moment. There was no red wave in the midterms. Matter of fact, the President and the Vice-President did better than any incumbent President in their first midterm. Polling was saying that it was going to be a red wave.\nThe polling was pretty accurate in 2022, but go on.\nWell, O.K., but remember it was reported that there would be a red wave.\nYou are right, there was a lot of talk of a red wave.\nSo there was no red wave. He was an incumbent, and he was the only person to have beaten Donald Trump. Those were the things that were true and in front of him, and he was being encouraged by Democrats in the leadership to run.\nSo you have no concern, even to this day, that Joe Biden could serve as President through January, 2029?\nI did not see anything that would’ve given me concern.\nBut you watched TV like the rest of us, right?\nI always couch it with this: of course, he was older. Of course, he was aging. He mentioned it. He talked about not speaking as well as he used to. He talked about not walking as well as he used to. No one is saying that he didn’t age, but he is someone that I engaged with. I saw him every single day as his White House press secretary, and he was someone that was engaged, on top of policy, challenging his staff.\nOne could conceivably think that he could do the job through January, 2025, but that it was not wise to think he could do the job through January, 2029, right?\nIt’s not my place to say.\nWhat do you mean it’s not your place to say?\nNo, no, no. Wait, I’m answering the question. I did not see anything that would cause me concern. That is my answer.\nExcept the debate, and the other things that everyone saw?\nWhat I’m saying to you is the debate for me was one time. I had never seen him like that before.\nYou write in the book, “He was just as defiant in his interview with [George] Stephanopoulos, though some nameless Democrats criticized that appearance too, saying it failed to ease their concerns.” This interview occurred after the debate, but before he dropped out. I went back and watched that interview. This was one answer he gave: “I, uh—I prepared what I usually would do, sitting down as I did, come back with foreign leaders or National Security Council for explicit detail. And I realized about partway through that, you know, all—I get quoted the New York Times had me down, at ten points before the debate, nine now, or whatever the hell it is. The fact of the matter is, that what I looked at is that he also lied twenty-eight times. I couldn’t, I mean, the way the debate ran, not—my fault, no one else’s fault—no one else’s fault.” When I watched that, I thought, This man should not be President for four more years. It doesn’t mean I think Donald Trump should be President, but I’m a little surprised that you don’t see what so many people, including so many Democrats, saw.\nI’m not the only person who feels this. I’m just the one speaking very loudly. I’m the person who’s saying the quiet thing out loud.\nThere’s a silent minority of people out there who feel that Biden was taken advantage of, and most people don’t want to say it. Is that what you mean?\nLet me just say, this is my experience that I’m speaking to, and what I saw. I just want to be very, very clear: on average. I just want to be clear: on average. Not from one interview, not from one debate. On average. I have heard from many, many people who were disappointed by the reaction of the Democratic Party. I have. I have. And these are citizens. These are people who vote.\nBiden also said in that interview, about him being down significantly in polls, “That’s not what our polls show . . . All the pollsters I talk to tell me it’s a tossup. It’s a tossup.” Apparently, Nancy Pelosi was concerned that Biden was not getting accurate information about what his polls against Trump showed. Was it a concern of yours that Biden was not getting accurate information about the state of the race?\nI was not involved in the campaign or any of the politics of it. I know that they had internal polling that was available to him that he was getting from his pollster. So I can’t speak to that. I really can’t. I didn’t see what he was getting. I didn’t see the polls he was talking about.\nI think that did concern people, though, that he seemed out of touch with where the race was.\nLook, that is one thing that I can’t speak to.\nOne thing in your book I was not expecting was that after Harris took over, you say you thought it was “an insult to [her]” that people wanted an open convention or didn’t want to have her be the nominee. Can you talk about that?\nYeah. I mean, look, you have to understand, I’m speaking also as a Black woman and what I experienced myself as being a first. This is not just me. There are many Black women who feel this. We are the backbone of the Party. We are on the front lines, and when it comes time to elevate us, or hear us, acknowledge our voice, we are largely ignored. And so the thinking was, Wait a minute, she’s the Vice-President. She’s more than qualified to be President. She was on the ballot in the primary with Joe Biden. Why wouldn’t she be the most qualified to do this? It’s almost like they didn’t want her. And so you have to understand the lens that I see that with, right? I feel that very viscerally, as do many in the Black community, and among Black women.\nI definitely thought that there was sexism and racism that Harris experienced during the campaign, and certainly before the campaign, too. But, when I talked to people about whether Harris should be the nominee or there should be an open convention, I found people split. And one reason some people thought that Harris should not be the nominee is that they did not think she could win, which is why I was surprised to read in your book, a little later on, that “the truth was, I never really believed Harris could win.” That’s why I’m a little confused when you say it was an insult to try to get her off the ticket.\nBut two things should be true, right? The thing that I say the second time actually proves the thing that I said the first time, right? Because it’s a feeling that we have. The reason I felt that is because of how we’re treated as Black women. We’re not elevated, we’re not protected, we’re not taken seriously. She was the Vice-President for heaven’s sake. But the reality of it is that being a Black woman, being Black and being a woman, it’s just tough. It’s hard. It makes it harder. And she ran a fantastic campaign, but it wasn’t good enough for some people. That is heartbreaking.\nShouldn’t you extend the same generosity to other people, who didn’t think she could win or that she was the best candidate?\nThis is a book about my experience.\nIt’s also attacking people with other opinions.\nYeah, but I have every right to talk about my experience and my perspective. That’s not taking away from others.\nMany people who did not think she could win wanted to replace her on the ticket because they thought beating Donald Trump was the most important thing for America, for any number of reasons having to do with race, foreign policy, whatever else, and that it was imperative to win the election. So what I was confused by was you saying that you didn’t think Harris could win, but then you attack other people who didn’t seem to think Harris could win by saying they were insulting her.\nYes. Well, again, I wish you could walk in my body and live my life, and then I think you could understand what I’m saying. I really do, because I think any other Black woman would understand what I’m saying. What it truly is is that it wasn’t just an open primary or a brokered convention. There was disrespect to her as well. It was discounting her and her position and who she was. That’s what it felt like. This is a very unique thing that I don’t think anyone would understand unless you walked in our bodies and lived our lives. My feeling was not about her not being qualified. It was about people not being able to see past her being Black and a woman. It’s not that confusing for us because we live this life day in and day out.\nI’m not trying to discount what you’re saying about Harris, but Biden is not an L.G.B.T.Q. Black woman, and you have the same feelings about how he was treated. This is what you keep going back to in the book. Sometimes I worry about losing sight of the fact that we’re dealing with a Presidential election here, and the feelings of Joe Biden are less important than the fate of the country.\nYou’re telling me about the feelings of Joe Biden, blah, blah, blah, but Joe Biden is out of the picture. He’s out of the picture.\nYeah, he sure is.\nHe’s out of the picture now and we lost.\nThis is what you wrote your book about. I am not bringing this up randomly.\nNo, I know, but you just said that to me. Right? So I’m just responding to it. He’s out of the picture. He stepped down, he’s out of the picture, and we lost. The book for me is really about the moment that we’re in. When I talk about the broken White House in the subtitle, I’m talking about the Trump White House. So what are the Democratic leadership actually doing to beat back and fight back? What are they doing?\nI’m not here to answer for the Democratic leadership. I would—\nYou’ve been answering for the Democratic leadership. [Laughs.] You were giving me their answers.\nI didn’t talk to anyone in Democratic leadership. I was just trying to remember how I and others felt watching Joe Biden in those weeks, that it felt like he was too old to be President for another four years, and too old to win.\nAnd here’s the thing: That’s your experience. That’s the experience that you had. ♦","summary":"Karine Jean-Pierre feels that Democrats were so mean to Biden that she is becoming an

as Obama is slammed for 'campaigning against black woman'","text":"Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Abigail Spanberger was considered a runaway favorite for the state's top office, but recent scandals and a lack of a clear identity for her party are keeping alive the chances of her Republican rival. \n\nIn the latest sign of peril, Barack Obama has been parachuted in and will speak alongside Spanberger next Saturday as polls show Republican candidate Winsome Earle-Sears gaining ground.\n\nThe former president's decision to enter the fray has been criticized as hypocritical after he bluntly rebuked black men for not supporting Kamala Harris during the most recent general election campaign.\n\n'I watched Obama sit there and chastise black men saying, y'all don't want to support this woman, but at the same time turn around, go to Virginia and campaign against a real natural black woman,' said one local on TikTok.\n\nSpanberger's campaign hit the skids earlier this month after her party's nominee for attorney general, Jay Jones, was plunged into scandal over texts he sent wishing death on then-Republican speaker of the Virginia House of Representatives.\n\nShe denounced Jones' rhetoric but stopped short of calling on him to drop out of the race, leading to widespread backlash. \n\nMeanwhile, Earle-Seares is gaining ground by campaigning for women's safety as the transgender issue has become a lightning rod in the state after a convicted sex offender identifying as a woman exposed himself in a Northern Virginia locker room.\n\nThus, the race for Virginia governor has tightened in recent weeks, with one survey from the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) showing Spanberger leading Earle-Sears, with 49 percent to Sears' 42 percent among registered voters, a drop from a nine-point lead in September’s Commonwealth Poll.\n\nIn a Saturday interview on Newsmax, Sears noted that if 'Abigail really believed those polls, she wouldn’t be flying in half the Democrat Party to save her.'\n\n'You can tell more about a campaign from their panic than from any poll,' Sears added.\n\nObama is just the latest big-name Democrat drafted in to assist flailing Spanberger after Bill and Hillary Clinton pulled in a record-breaking $2.2 million for her at a McLean, Virginia, fundraiser on October 13.\n\nThe event, which was hosted by former Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe at his home, drew more than 350 donors and became the 'largest gubernatorial fundraiser in Virginia history,' according to Politico.\n\nObama endorsed Spanberger on October 16 and is planning to campaign with her in the Hampton Roads area of Virginia on November 1.\n\nHis attempt to tip the scales sparked controversy online. \n\nIn a video posted on X, user @TheThe1776 called out Obama for chastising 'Black men for not supporting Kamala Harris' in 2024, but for coming to the Commonwealth to campaign 'against a natural born Black woman in Virginia.'\n\nX user EllieKayUSA wrote Friday that if 'Winsome Sears were a Democrat, she'd be on every magazine cover & mainstream media would be extolling her at every opportunity.'\n\n'But since Sears has an (R) next to her name, they pretend she doesn't exist, & if Spanberger loses, it's due to misogyny,' she added.\n\nA social media creator The Black MAGA Preacher added in his own X post that 'the NAACP just endorsed a liberal white woman over the conservative Black woman running for Virginia governor.'\n\n'The NAACP is a joke — it should be dismantled,' he concluded.\n\nSears is running both to make history and to continue Governor Glenn Youngkin's legacy in the Commonwealth, while Spanberger is attempting to run as a more moderate or mainstream Democrat without alienating the far left of her party.\n\nStatewide elections next week in Virginia, as well as New Jersey, will be closely watched as political observers will hope to draw conclusions about the future of a post-Trump GOP, as well as a Democratic party searching for a new identity.","summary":"The race for Virginia governor has tightened in recent weeks, sending Democrats

Baier anchors “Special Report,” a nightly newscast that like many Fox News programs is closely followed by President Donald Trump.\n\nAnderson Cooper, whose contract will soon be up at CNN, has also been mentioned internally as an evening news anchor candidate.\n\nThe changes to “CBS Evening News” were initiated by former “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens, who was pushed out of the company amid the controversy over a 2024 interview with former vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nTrump sued the network over the interview which he said was deceptively edited to help her presidential campaign. Although the case labeled as frivolous by First Amendment experts, Paramount settled the suit for $16 million to clear the regulatory path for its merger with Skydance Media.\n\nA former writer for Time magazine, Dickerson came to CBS News as a contributor before taking on a variety of roles in the division. He was anchor of the Washington-based public affairs program “Face the Nation.” He moved to New York to join “CBS This Morning” after the network fired Charlie Rose over sexual harassment allegations in 2017.\n\nDickerson anchored a nightly prime time newscast on CBS News Streaming before being tapped for “CBS Evening News.” He could not be immediately reached for comment.\n\n©2025 Los Angeles Times.

Weiss took over as editor-in-chief after Skydance, the new parent company of Paramount, which owns CBS, purchased The Free Press for $150 million in early October. (RELATED: Journos Are Losing It At New Pick To Lead CBS News)\n\nJennings and Weiss did not immediately respond to requests for comment from the Daily Caller News Foundation about the report. Jennings, a former George W. Bush administration official and former aide to Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, has become popular among conservatives for defending Trump on CNN.\n\nWeiss reportedly has a mandate from Skydance CEO David Ellison to restore balance to CBS News, according to NPR.\n\n“We believe the majority of the country longs for news that is balanced and fact-based, and we want CBS to be their home,” Ellison said in an Oct. 6 statement that announced Weiss’ hiring and the acquisition of The Free Press.\n\nCBS settled a $10 billion lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over the editing of an October 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential election, drawing criticism from inside the company, including from outgoing “CBS Evening News” co-host John Dickerson.\n\nWeiss has been eyeing a new weekday anchor for the nightly news broadcast and is reportedly plotting to poach “Special Report” anchor Bret Baier from Fox News. Former “CBS Evening News” anchor Norah O’Donnell is also reportedly under consideration to return to the desk after departing in January 2025 in favor of Dickerson and co-host Maurice DuBois.\n\nThe effort to hire Baier, first reported by Oliver Darcy in his Status newsletter, may not take place immediately, since he is under contract with Fox through 2028 at a salary of $14 million per year, according to Mediaite. Jennings, who is not a full-time employee at CNN, would likely have more freedom to take an offer from CBS, according to The New York Post.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

We’re more powerful than any dictator.”\n\nBiden, 82, was speaking publicly for the first time since completing a round of radiation therapy for an aggressive form of prostate cancer. He addressed an audience in Boston after receiving the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Edward M. Kennedy Institute.\n\nHe said America depends on a presidency with limited power, a functioning Congress and an autonomous judiciary. With the federal government facing its second-longest shutdown on record, Trump has used the lapse in funding to exercise new command over the government.\n\n“Friends, I can’t sugarcoat any of this. These are dark days,” Biden said. He predicted the country would “find our true compass again” and “emerge as we always have — stronger, wiser and more resilient, more just, so long as we keep the faith.”\n\nBiden listed examples of people who are standing their ground against threats from the current administration, citing federal employees who resign in protest, and universities and comedians that have been targeted by Trump.\n\n“The late-night hosts continue to shine a light on free speech knowing their careers are on the line,” he said.\n\nBiden also shouted out Republican officials who vote against the Trump administration.\n\n“America is not a fairy tale,” he said. “For 250 years, it’s been a constant push and pull, an existential struggle between peril and possibility.”\n\nHe finished the speech by telling people to “get back up.”\n\nThe Democrat left office in January after serving one term in the White House.

JB Pritzker asserted on Wallace’s podcast that he had never “suggested that Donald Trump is Hitler,” despite his record of repeatedly linking Trump to Hitler and Nazis. Wallace not only accepted Pritzker’s claim at face value, but took it a step further.

We know exactly what he’ll do if he’s in power again. It cannot happen.”\n\nBoth The New York Times and The Atlantic published stories before on Oct. 22, 2024, where Trump’s former chief of staff John Kelly alleged Trump praised Hitler.

You’ve heard it from officials, former officials who worked for the former president say this as well,” Jean-Pierre said. “So, you know, do we agree, I know that the vice president just spoke about this. Do we agree about that determination? Yes, we do.”\n\nFurthermore, Democratic Texas Rep.

President's New Remark Sparks Speculation","text":"US President Donald Trump has reignited speculation that he may attempt to seek another term in 2028. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Trump ruled out running for Vice-President but declined to explicitly say he would not pursue a third term. When asked about the possibility of contesting the presidency again, Trump told reporters onboard Air Force One: \"I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever.\" Pressed further on whether he was ruling out a third-term bid, he responded: \"Am I not ruling it out? I mean you'll have to tell me.\" Asked whether he would be prepared to challenge the legal limits on presidential terms in court, Trump replied: \"I haven't really thought about it.\" Trump also mentioned Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as potential contenders for the 2028 election. \"I think if they ever formed a group, it'd be unstoppable,\" he said. \"I really do. I believe that.\" At 79, Trump will be the oldest president in US history when he leaves office in January 2029, at the end of his second term. Can Trump Run for a Third Time? The 22nd Amendment to the US Constitution prohibits any president from seeking a third term in office. Nevertheless, Trump and some of his supporters have continued to float the idea of him appearing on the 2028 ballot. He has also been spotted wearing \"Trump 2028\" hats at several events. Some commentators have speculated that Trump could attempt to run as vice president alongside another candidate, who might later step down to allow him to assume office again — though such a scenario would almost certainly face constitutional challenges. Last week, former Trump strategist Steve Bannon claimed that a \"plan\" was being developed to secure Trump another term. \"Trump is going to be president in '28, and people ought to just get accommodated with that,\" Bannon told The Economist. \"At the appropriate time, we'll lay out what the plan is.\" Trump's decision to build a large ballroom — scheduled for completion in 2028 — has also fuelled speculation that he has no plans to leave the White House permanently at the end of his term. Any effort to repeal the 22nd Amendment would require the approval of two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, or a constitutional convention called by two-thirds of state legislatures — a process seen as highly improbable. In March, Trump told CNBC he would \"probably not\" run again but later said he was \"not joking\" about the possibility. Who All Are Likely to Run for Presidency in 2028? It remains unclear which Democrats will seek the presidency in 2028, though several have expressed interest. California Governor Gavin Newsom told CBS that he would \"be lying\" if he said he was not seriously considering a bid. Former vice president Kamala Harris told the BBC she may also run again, saying she could \"possibly\" be president in the future.

Abrams and the Mumfords have been connected for a while. Last November, she and her co-writer Audrey Hobert revealed that they once played the band a “very vulgar” version of her song “That’s So True.”\n\nAbrams explained that she and Hobart were writing “That’s So True” on the roof of Electric Lady Studios, and they didn’t realize that there was another roof above them. The pair were “a little drunk in a great way — in a light, fresh way,” as Abrams put it. “We weren’t like sloppy,” Hobart added. And they “were just doubled over in tears, laughing so hard, saying the most horrific shit to song,” Abrams continued.\n\nTrending Stories\n\nCongress Enjoys Ultraluxe Health Care as It Fights to Gut Yours\n\nRadiohead Talk European Tour and Why They Took Break in New Interview: ‘The Wheels Came Off a Bit’\n\nHow Activists Are Fighting Trump’s Immigration Crackdown in Chicago\n\nThere’s Now a Casino in Everyone’s Pocket.

Martin Heinrich Backs Cardi B’s Claims About the Economy & Cost of Living Being Too High: She ‘Is Right’\n\nCardi B Fires Back at People Trying to Get Her to Lose Endorsement Deals: ‘Y’all Not Stopping No Bags Over Here’\n\nThe Grammy-winning rapper hopped on Instagram Live over the weekend, where she bluntly stated, “Donald Trump was never for y’all poor motherf—kers.”\n\nShe continued to say that Trump’s alleged disdain for the poor applies to all ethnicities. “Donald Trump was never for the poor people. For the white poors, for the Black poors, for the Spanish poors, for the Asians, for the Indians. He don’t give a f—k about none of y’all motherf—s,” Cardi said. “To him, even millionaires are poor.”\n\nCardi’s rant was seemingly inspired by the USDA’s announcement that checks for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps for 40 million Americans, will not go out on Nov. 1. The news came after Dept. of Agriculture memo surfaced Oct. 24, indicating that the Trump administration will not use about $5 billion in contingency funds to help the program as the government shutdown continues, according to the Associated Press.\n\n“Now, Donald Trump was blaming the immigrants for America’s downfall,” she said. “Like, I do understand if a country wants to enforce more strict immigration laws. I understand that. However, he was using that as an excuse for the issues that we have in this country, in this economy.”\n\nThe 33-year-old went on: “Now, how many f—king immigrants has he deported? He has deported so many people. So, now the immigrants are deported, who are we blaming for the fact that we are practically going into a recession? We don’t even have food stamps.”\n\nCardi B originally wasn’t going to vote in the 2024 election, as she didn’t agree with Democrats’ “funding wars,” but she ended up throwing her support behind Kamala Harris. Cardi gave the former VP her endorsement with a public appearance at a Milwaukee rally ahead of the election.\n\n“You really wanted better for ALL of us!” the rapper wrote in a post-election letter to Harris following the loss to Trump. “This may not mean much but I am so proud of you! No one has ever made me change my mind and you did! I never thought I would see the day that a woman of color would be running for the President of the United States, but you have shown me, shown my daughters and women across the country that anything is possible.”\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

Përpjekja për t’i vjedhur vëmendjen Donald Trump vjen nga sfiduesja e tij presidenciale e vitit 2024, Kamala Harris , e cila në orët e fundit është hapur ndaj një kandidature të mundshme në vitin 2028. “Nuk kam mbaruar ende”, tha ish-prokurorja e Kalifornisë në një intervistë me BBC- në. Harris, e mundur nga manjati në fund të një fushate zgjedhore që zgjati pak më shumë se tre muaj dhe u nis pas tërheqjes së Joe Biden, tha se mbesat e saj do të shohin një presidente femër “me siguri, gjatë jetës së tyre”, duke pranuar se kishte menduar të kandidonte përsëri për komandant të përgjithshëm. Ish-nënpresidenti shtoi se e kishte kaluar të gjithë karrierën e tij “duke i shërbyer shtetit dhe kjo është në gjakun tim”, por sqaroi se ende nuk kishte marrë një vendim përfundimtar për të ardhmen e tij politike.\n\nRikandidimi i Harris\n\nKur iu tha se ajo është prapa në sondazhe, madje edhe pas aktorit Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Harris u përgjigj se nëse do t’i kishte dëgjuar, “nuk do të kisha kandiduar për mandatin tim të parë apo të dytë, dhe sigurisht që nuk do të isha ulur këtu”. Ish-prokurorja deklaroi më pas se parashikimet e saj për atë që do të bënte Trump pasi të kthehej në Shtëpinë e Bardhë ishin realizuar. “Ai tha se do ta përdorte Departamentin e Drejtësisë si armë, dhe e ka bërë pikërisht këtë”, tha politikania demokrate, duke aluduar në paditë e fundit, ndër të tjera, ndaj ish-drejtorit të FBI-së James Comey dhe Prokurores së Qytetit të Nju Jorkut Letitia James. Lidhur me fajin për humbjen e saj në zgjedhje, Harris, e cila aktualisht është në një turne për promovimin e librit të saj “107 Ditë”, i cili përshkruan kandidaturën e saj për Shtëpinë e Bardhë, tha se do të donte të kishte pasur më shumë kohë për t’u lidhur me amerikanët e klasës punëtore dhe për të shpjeguar axhendën e saj mbi strehimin dhe kujdesin ndaj fëmijëve.\n\nPërsëritja e skenarit\n\nZëdhënësja e Shtëpisë së Bardhë, Abigail Jackson, komentoi intervistën e Harris me BBC- në duke thënë se, pas humbjes së saj zgjedhore, ish-sfiduesja e Trump nuk e kuptoi që ” populli amerikan nuk është i interesuar për gënjeshtrat e saj absurde”. Megjithatë, duket se gara e vitit 2024 mund të përsëritet. Podkasteri i MAGA-s dhe ish-ndihmës i Krahut Perëndimor, Steve Bannon, sugjeroi në një intervistë të kohëve të fundit se ekziston një plan që Presidenti Donald Trump të përpiqet të sfidojë Kushtetutën dhe të kërkojë një mandat të tretë në detyrë në vitin 2028. “Trump do të jetë president në vitin 2028 dhe njerëzit thjesht duhet të përshtaten me këtë”, i tha ai The Economist më 23 tetor. Edhe pse Bannon, i cili vuajti katër muaj burg vitin e kaluar dhe është deklaruar fajtor për akuza të veçanta për mashtrim , nuk ka të njëjtin pushtet në Shtëpinë e Bardhë siç kishte gjatë mandatit të parë të Trump, ai tregoi se ka “shumë alternativa të ndryshme” për ta mbajtur ish-shefin e tij në presidencë. “Në kohën e duhur, ne do të paraqesim se cili është plani,” tha Bannon. “Por ekziston një plan.”\n\nPlanet e Trump\n\nTrump e ka përmendur publikisht këtë ide në shumë raste që kur fitoi rizgjedhjen në vitin 2024, pavarësisht faktit se Amendamenti i 22-të i ndalon një presidenti të kandidojë për më shumë se dy mandate katërvjeçare, pavarësisht nëse ato kanë qenë të njëpasnjëshme. Kufizimet e mandatit presidencial janë një parim qendror i demokracisë amerikane dhe sistemit politik amerikan. Pohimet e Trumpit në lidhje me marrjen me qira të Shtëpisë së Bardhë janë vetëm një nga shumë shembuj të gatishmërisë së tij për të shkelur kufijtë e autoritetit ekzekutiv. Republikanët e Kongresit deri më tani i kanë hedhur poshtë komentet e presidentit në lidhje me shërbimin e një mandati të tretë. Udhëheqësi i shumicës në Senat, John Thune, republikan nga Dakota e Jugut, u tha gazetarëve në mars se Trump nuk mund të qëndronte në Shtëpinë e Bardhë “pa një ndryshim në Kushtetutë”.","summary":"Partia Demokratike, ose një segment i saj, po përpiqet të bëjë bujë dhe të krijojë një hapësirë ​​për vete në një media të dominuar nga iniciativat e politikës së jashtme dhe të brendshme të Shtëpisë së Bardhë, në mes të një mbylljeje federale pa asnjë fund në horizont.

But the people said he was cognizant that significant changes, including a revamp of the “Evening News,” were on the way at the news division, which is now under the editorial control of opinion journalist Bari Weiss.\n\nWeiss was appointed by Skydance, a Hollywood studio run by technology heir David Ellison that completed its absorption of Paramount in August. The deal was approved by federal regulators after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit brought by President Donald Trump against the CBS program “60 Minutes,” which he accused of deceptively editing an interview with his presidential opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWeiss, a frequent critic of traditional news organizations, has pledged to restore CBS’ trust with viewers, and she signaled in her first weeks on the job that she wants a new direction for the news division.\n\nWeiss, in a recent meeting, asked the staff of “60 Minutes” why the country thinks they are biased, and she has mused about the possibility of hiring Bret Baier, a Fox News anchor, for a potential anchor position at the “CBS Evening News,” according to a person familiar with her remarks. Baier is under contract at Fox through the end of 2028; the idea she may approach Baier was first reported by media newsletter Status.\n\n“CBS Evening News,” which changed its format last year, has suffered from a sharp ratings decline and now badly lags its rivals at ABC and NBC. The program, which Dickerson co-anchors with Maurice DuBois, is expected to be reimagined in the months ahead.\n\nLayoffs at Paramount Skydance are also expected to occur this week, with CBS News bracing for deep job cuts.\n\nDickerson, 57, has a long family legacy at CBS News.\n\nHis mother, Nancy Dickerson, was a broadcast journalist who, in 1960, became CBS’ first female correspondent. John Dickerson started his career as a print journalist at Time magazine and joined CBS News as a contributor in 2009. He has been its political director, moderator of “Face the Nation,” and a co-host of the morning show, and he moderated a pair of televised primary debates in the 2016 campaign.\n\n“John epitomizes the very best of journalism,” Tom Cibrowski, president of CBS News, said in a statement today.\n\nDickerson is also a contributing writer at The Atlantic and a co-host of Slate’s Political Gabfest podcast.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"Anchor John Dickerson said today that he would depart CBS News at the end of the year, the first sign of what is expected to be a major shake-up at the network under its new corporate owners.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/10/27/breaking-news/john-dickerson-anchor-and-correspondent-to-leave-cbs-news/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/web1_20251027_brk_cbs01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 19:00:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.26},{"id":373116554,"title":"‘CBS Evening News’ Co-Host Announces He’s Leaving Show As Speculation Swirls Over Bari Weiss’ Next Moves","text":"“CBS Evening News” co-host John Dickerson announced on Monday that he will be leaving the network weeks after Bari Weiss was named editor-in-chief of CBS News.\n\nDickerson, who had been with the network for 16 years, was picked to replace Norah O’Donnell as host of the nightly broadcast news show alongside Maurice DuBois in January 2025. Dickerson told followers on Instagram his last show would be in December.

I will miss you.”\n\n View this post on Instagram \n\nHis decision to depart the network came less than four weeks after Skydance, the new owners of CBS News’ parent company, Paramount, named Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News after purchasing The Free Press for $150 million. Weiss is reportedly trying to recruit Fox News “Special Report” host Bret Baier to the network.\n\nCBS sent the Daily Caller News Foundation a copy of Dickerson’s statement after being reached for comment.\n\nCBS settled a $10 billion lawsuit filed by President Donald Trump over the editing of an October 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, who was Trump’s opponent in the 2024 presidential election, drawing criticism from inside the company, including from Dickerson.\n\n“Can you hold power to account after paying it millions?” Dickerson said during the July 3 edition of “Reporter’s Notebook.” “Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust?

Why The ‘CBS Evening News’ Co-Anchor Is Leaving After 15 Years","text":"Veteran political journalist John Dickerson, co-anchor of “CBS Evening News,” announced Monday that he will depart CBS News at the end of the year, ending a 15-year tenure with the network. The move marks the first high-profile departure since Bari Weiss was appointed editor in chief of CBS News earlier this month, part of a sweeping internal restructuring aimed at modernising the network’s editorial direction. Dickerson shared the news in a heartfelt Instagram post, writing: “I am extremely grateful for all that CBS News gave me — the work, the audience’s attention, and the honour of being a part of the network’s history — and I am grateful for my dear colleagues who’ve made me a better journalist and a better human being. I will miss you.” Dickerson joined CBS News in 2009, initially as a political contributor after his tenure at Time magazine, later anchoring “Face the Nation” and “CBS This Morning”. He took over as co-anchor of “CBS Evening News” in January 2025 alongside Maurice DuBois, replacing Norah O’Donnell as part of a broader programming overhaul led by then–executive producer Bill Owens. Leadership Shake-Up and Future of CBS Evening News Despite the format changes, “CBS Evening News” has continued to trail ABC’s “World News Tonight” and NBC’s “Nightly News” in overall viewership, prompting internal discussions about another revamp. Sources cited by The Los Angeles Times indicate that Weiss is exploring bold anchor changes, including outreach to Fox News’ Bret Baier and CNN’s Anderson Cooper, whose contracts end in 2028 and 2026 respectively. Weiss, who joined CBS after a stint leading The Free Press, has been described as seeking a “more assertive, journalistically independent tone” across CBS platforms. Her arrival follows years of internal turbulence at CBS, including a 2024 defamation lawsuit by Donald Trump over an interview with Kamala Harris, which Paramount settled for $16 million ahead of its merger with Skydance Media. Dickerson’s Legacy at CBS Over his 15-year tenure, Dickerson became known for his analytical depth and calm interviewing style. His departure closes a chapter for CBS News as the network pivots toward a younger, opinion-forward leadership under Weiss. Dickerson has not disclosed his next move, though industry sources suggest he may pursue long-form projects or a return to political commentary ahead of the 2026 election cycle..

The charges are precise — sexist cyber-harassment directed at France’s first lady, Brigitte Macron — but the reverberations are anything but. This is a case about rumor, age, gender and the strange energy of online mobs. It is also a story about how a small northern city called Amiens became the unlikely epicenter of an international spectacle.\n\n“You feel like you’re watching a slow-motion assault that no one can touch,” said Marie Lefèvre, who runs a tiny pâtisserie three blocks from the Trogneux family confectionery in Amiens. “People used to visit for the macarons and the quiet streets; now they whisper about things they read on a phone in another country.”\n\nWhat’s at Stake\n\nTen people — eight men and two women, aged between 41 and 60 — are due before a Paris criminal court, accused of making repeated malicious comments about Brigitte Macron’s gender and sexuality and of equating the couple’s 24-year age difference with criminality. If convicted, they face up to two years behind bars, a reminder that French law has tangible teeth when it comes to harassment and defamation.\n\nThe legal case is the latest chapter in a long-running saga that began in earnest during Emmanuel Macron’s rise to the presidency in 2017. Since then, a rumor — now repeatedly described by prosecutors as unfounded — has circulated: that Brigitte Macron was assigned male at birth. That rumor has been amplified by far-right commentators, conspiracy-minded circles in France and abroad, and a handful of online influencers.\n\nA timeline of escalation\n\nConsider how the story moved from gossip to government-level action:\n\n2017 — Rumours began surfacing during Emmanuel Macron’s election campaign.\n\n2021 — A long-form YouTube interview alleges a family connection and identity confusion.\n\nAugust 2024 — Brigitte Macron files a complaint in France prompting investigations into cyber-harassment.\n\nDecember 2024 & February 2025 — Police make arrests connected to the online posts and harassment.\n\nJuly 2024 — The presidential couple files a separate defamation lawsuit in the United States against a conservative podcaster.\n\nPresent — Criminal trial of ten defendants in Paris.\n\nFaces and Voices\n\nAmong the defendants is Aurélien Poirson-Atlan, a 41-year-old publicist who has cultivated an online presence under the name “Zoe Sagan” and is often associated with conspiracy communities. Also named is Delphine J., a 51-year-old self-described spiritual medium who goes by Amandine Roy; she was already the subject of an earlier libel case.\n\n“It’s not just about one person’s dignity. It’s about the permissiveness of our public spaces,” said Laurent Dubois, a Paris-based cyberlawyer who has followed the case. “When rumors about private life are weaponized for clicks, they don’t just harm reputations. They degrade public discourse.”\n\nAcross the Atlantic, the controversy has slipped into America’s culture wars. The Macrons filed a defamation suit in the U.S. in July against a prominent conservative podcaster who produced a series claiming Brigitte Macron was born male. The French couple have signaled they will produce “scientific” evidence and photographs in that lawsuit, according to their U.S. lawyer — a striking move that turns intimacy into exhibits.\n\nHow the Internet Became a Megaphone\n\nOnline harassment is not a uniquely French problem. A 2021 Pew Research Center study found that 41% of adults reported experiencing some form of online harassment, and about 22% said they had been targeted with severe harassment or stalking. Women, public figures and marginalized people disproportionately bear the brunt.\n\n“The algorithms don’t judge; they amplify,” said Dr. Anaïs Morel, a researcher in digital culture who studies how conspiracy narratives spread. “A salacious or absurd claim is ideally suited to travel quickly because it provokes outrage, confusion and repeat sharing. After a while, repetition substitutes for evidence.”\n\nIn Amiens, that repetition has real-world effects. Shopkeepers speak of strangers showing up at the family’s former chocolate shop looking for answers; locals have received messages, and the town — known for its gothic cathedral and riverside promenades — has had to contend with a new kind of pilgrimage: rumor-seekers with smartphones.\n\n“We sell Trogneux chocolates,” said Luc Chardin, 58, who runs a souvenir stall near the cathedral. “People come to enjoy the town and suddenly conversation turns. They ask questions about things that are not true. You can feel the strain. It’s not only about politics — it’s about respect.”\n\nBroader Patterns: Gendered Lies as a Political Weapon\n\nBrigitte Macron is far from the only woman targeted by grotesque disinformation about gender or sexuality. High-profile figures including Michelle Obama, Kamala Harris and New Zealand’s late prime minister Jacinda Ardern have all been subject to similar lies. Why this pattern?\n\n“Sexist narratives travel well because they elide complex realities in favor of a single, salacious hook,” said Sophie Tremblay, director of a French NGO working on online safety. “They make audiences complicit — people who might never otherwise engage in political violence end up circulating dehumanizing material.”\n\nThis weaponization of gender talkers cuts across borders, feeding into global anxieties about identity, legitimacy, and power. In the United States, transgender rights have become a polarizing flashpoint; in France, a country prizing laïcité and republican values, the attacks have leaned heavily on intimate slander and moral panic.\n\nWhere Do We Go From Here?\n\nThe trial itself will be more than a legal bellwether. It is a test of how democracies respond when digital rumor slides into harassment, and when public curiosity tramples on private life. Will criminal penalties deter future mobs chasing virality? Will legal avenues provide meaningful reprieve for public figures whose private histories are stripped and sold online?\n\n“People love a story where the powerful are somehow not what they seem,” observed Camille Martin, a sociology professor who studies rumor and political communication. “But you have to ask: at what cost? The cost here is human dignity and the integrity of information.”\n\nAs the courtroom prepares for testimony and the town of Amiens resumes its slow rhythm of market days and church bells, there is an unsettled question that extends beyond one couple or one rumor: how do we protect truth and human dignity in an era when anyone with a phone can be a witness — or a weapon?\n\nThink about the last time you saw a rumor online and scrolled past it. What did you assume about the person who posted it? About your own role in circulating it? At the end of the day, the digital spaces we inhabit are built on our choices, shared in tiny acts: click, share, retweet, comment. What will we choose to build with them?","summary":"A Trial, a Rumour, and the Quiet Town at the Center of a Storm In a hushed courtroom in Paris, ten ordinary faces will stand before a judge accused of a decidedly modern crime: weaponizing the internet to erode a woman’s dignity.

(Photo illustration by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nWhat To Know\n\nAcross the board, 23 percent of Americans in the eHarmony survey said different political viewpoints could cause them to turn down a date.\n\nFor millennials, that rate was 21 percent, while Gen Z was a bit higher at 28 percent.\n\nAnd just 13 percent of Gen Z said similar political views could persuade them to travel a greater distance for a date, whereas 14 percent of millennials said the same.\n\nThis data contrasts with another recent survey from the SheKnows Teen Council that revealed some of the youngest, teenage age Gen Z feel uncomfortable dating someone with different views.\n\nOver half of female respondents said they’d feel somewhat uneasy, while a third said they’d feel very uncomfortable. Across the male respondents, 57 percent would still be comfortable.\n\nMeanwhile, a Coffee Meets Bagel report found that 37 percent of women across the Gen Z, millennial and Gen X age cohorts would not consider dating someone with different political views. Only 15 percent of men said the same.\n\nWhat People Are Saying\n\nClinical psychologist Dr. Hannah Holmes previously told Newsweek: “Gen Z grew up hearing stories about couples—or even seeing their own parents or family members—separating due to differences in political and social beliefs. Many of them see it as a serious sign of lack of compatibility, rather than a minor difference in opinion.”\n\n“Politics aren’t just abstract concepts for many Gen Z-ers, but instead ways of understanding reality, with real-world consequences. Understandably, this means that a misalignment in politics is understood as a misalignment of core values, which is typically considered a relationship deal-breaker.”\n\nWhat Happens Next\n\nIf more Gen Z-ers decide to refrain from dating those with different political viewpoints, that could dramatically lower their range of dating partners.\n\nStill, for those who don’t keep this as a dating deal-breaker, more potential life partners could be found that still offer some compatibility, depending on the level of difference in viewpoints.\n\n“Young voters don’t like aligning themselves too closely with political parties in general, because they tend not to trust institutions … Which, to me, further suggests that many under-30s may not have hard and fast rules when it comes to the ideological allegiances or political affiliations of the people they date—and ultimately marry,” New York Times writer Jessica Grose wrote last year.","summary":"Roughly 28 percent of Gen Z said different political opinions could lead them to turn down a date.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/are-gen-z-more-willing-to-date-across-political-lines-than-millennials-10946557","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-1016772796-2.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 18:19:12","author":"Suzanne Blake","authors":["Suzanne Blake"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.069},{"id":373119682,"title":"Democrats reopen old wounds with 2028 calendar kickoff","text":"Democratic state parties are set to receive a request for proposals that they can submit to the committee if they want to apply for an early voting slot.\n\nThe process is meant to give states ample time to make their case to the national party apparatus and create an orderly process, but it will inevitably flare tensions after New Hampshire was dislodged from its first-in-the-nation status last cycle. \n\nMembers of the committee were adamant that the new process would help the DNC select states that reflect not only the changing demographics of the nation, but also claw back the White House from Republican control.\n\n“I think that as we go through this process, the real question we face is asking each state why including them in the early window, pre-window, period helps us elect a Democratic president and win the elections,” said Stuart Appelbaum, a committee member. “That is [the] prime criteria that we will be looking at and making our decision.”\n\nStates will need to meet three criteria — rigorousness, fairness, and efficiency — that show each state has a diverse enough group of voters needed to win the election and that they are working to include them in the process. States will also need to touch on geographic diversity, media markets, and digital communication/social media plans and provide evidence of support from state parties, state election officials, and legislative leaders.\n\nSince former Vice President Kamala Harris’s loss to President Donald Trump, Democrats have reflected on their platform and message, with some questioning whether a focus on identity over economic matters may have cost them the White House.\n\nLeah Daughtry cautioned Democrats against moving away from affirming the key constituencies that have consistently supported the party during a passionate speech. “I don’t want us to affirm that we are stepping back in any way for the concern and the attention we pay to the core people who vote for us every single cycle, because it feels like erasure,” she said. \n\nThe party is also still reeling from the drama that booted New Hampshire and Iowa from their top spots in the nominating window.\n\nFormer President Joe Biden deprived New Hampshire of its first-in-the-nation primary status during the 2024 presidential cycle by giving South Carolina, a state that helped him win the nomination in 2020, the first spot. The Iowa caucuses were also dethroned from their early position after a disastrous performance in 2020.\n\nJoanne Dowdell, a committee member, suggested “states need to show their ability to report the results of the election in a timely manner,” likely alluding to Iowa’s problems in the past. The committee ultimately added an amendment to the resolution asking states to describe their experience conducting a party-run caucus and primary, and how problems will be avoided in 2028. \n\nIn the last cycle, New Hampshire defied Biden and the DNC and set the state’s primary before South Carolina, forcing state Democrats to stage a successful write-in operation for Biden.\n\nRaymond Buckley, New Hampshire’s state party chairman, claimed the Granite State should vote first, not because of a state law mandating it, but because it represents the base of the Democratic Party, in a more conciliatory memo sent out before the Monday meeting.\n\n“Rather, New Hampshire will highlight that we should go first because we are unique in being a small, purple state with an exceptional track record of civic engagement,” Buckley wrote. \n\n“We believe New Hampshire offers diversity in a number of key areas, but also that the early primary states should be considered as a whole – not just individually – in terms of providing strong racial and geographic diversity,” he also noted. \n\nThe DNC is still figuring out what severe penalties to impose on state parties that buck its early state process, which will get hammered out at the beginning of 2026.\n\n“I think it’s important for folks to realize that there are three steps to this process. This is the criteria on which we’re going to consider these bids for the early state window. We still have to codify the call and rules,” said DNC chairman Ken Martin. \n\nElaine Kamarck, another committee member, alluded to the problem of state legislatures, particularly Republican-controlled legislatures, interfering in the presidential primary process. “I think that one of the things the states that are coming before us have to show is, well, can they get the legislature … can they get them to do this? Otherwise, it’s just a waste of time,” Kamarck said.\n\nDNC continues to pay Harris campaign debt almost a year after she lost\n\nDonna Brazile, a former interim DNC chairwoman, also pointed to the migration patterns of Americans as a key factor in which states may be considered for early voting status. December estimates from the Brennan Center for Justice show that southern states will gain nine seats in the next reapportionment of congressional districts, with Texas, Florida, and North Carolina leading the changes.\n\n“What worries me now is that we’re set to see more demographic transformation across the country. The Sun Belt states are going to become more and more competitive,” Brazile said. “And so we might want to take a look at this so-called guideline that we have to have one from each region, four regions, when the greatest growth will occur over the next couple of years, including upwards until 2030, in Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Texas, Florida, and Nevada, and I just don’t want us to box ourselves in.”","summary":"The Democratic National Committee is jump-starting a fight over which states vote first in the 2028 presidential calendar, approving a process Monday expected to invite controversy after the party’s primary shake-up in 2024.

Weeks before the Trump administration approved the deal, Paramount paid Donald Trump $16 million to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\n\n“He’s a huge, huge loss,” one CBS News senior staffer told The Independent, while another network employee said it felt like the network “wanted him to fail.”\n\nRepresentatives for CBS News and Dickerson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, other CBS News sources expressed their “disappointment” at Dickerson's departure from the network after a lengthy career that also included hosting CBS News’ flagship morning program and Sunday political talk show. “He is a true journalist,” one network reporter said.\n\nDickerson’s exit from the network was first announced internally during Monday’s 10 a.m. editorial morning news call, prompting the longtime CBS anchor to quickly take to his social media to publicly reveal that he was stepping away.\n\n“At the end of this year, I will leave CBS, 16 years after I sat in as Face the Nation anchor for the first time,” he wrote on Instagram. “I am extremely grateful for all that CBS gave me— the work, the audience’s attention and the honor of being a part of the network’s history— and I am grateful for my dear colleagues who’ve made me a better journalist and a better human. I will miss you.”\n\nIn a separate note, CBS News President Tom Cibrowski said that Dickerson would continue to host CBS Evening News until the holidays, adding that the veteran anchor “epitomizes the very best of journalism” and that there will be “plenty of time to thank him for his work here and honor his contributions to our success.” Cibrowski also framed the decision as Dickerson’s, saying that he “had decided” to step away from the network.\n\nIt was just a year ago that Dickerson was tapped to replace Norah O’Donnell on CBS Evening News, as the company decided to go with a two-man anchor team featuring Dickerson and reporter Maurice DuBois. The shake-up not only saw O’Donnell step down as the face of the program, but the network also brought the show back to New York City. \n\nThe experiment, which network insiders initially said they were “excited and fearful” over as “nothing was really working” under O’Donnell’s leadership, has largely been seen as unsuccessful so far. The show’s ratings have only continued to fall, and the weeknight telecast has fallen further behind its broadcast counterparts.\n\nWhile staffers who spoke with The Independent about Dickerson’s departure said they were “not surprised,” especially amid the new corporate ownership and the installation of Weiss as the newsroom’s editorial leader, they still expressed sadness over his exit and felt the network was worse off with him leaving.\n\n“He’s an excellent journalist, good human being, and someone you want in a newsroom,” the network senior staffer said, adding that the combination of Weiss’ arrival and the efforts to once again reshape the evening news broadcast “was probably too much for him.”\n\nAdding that Dickerson has held “nearly every marquee job” at the network during his tenure, the senior staffer remarked that the anchor has had “quite the journey” at CBS News. Besides CBS Evening News, Dickerson also served as the lead anchor of Face the Nation and CBS Mornings, and reported for the network’s legendary newsmagazine, 60 Minutes. \n\n“Still, it is a huge, huge loss” for the newsroom, the staffer remarked.\n\nCommending Dickerson as a “true journalist,” a network reporter noted that there was a “lot of disappointment” among the news staff over the anchor’s exit. Meanwhile, a longtime journalist at the network praised Dickerson’s reporting while suggesting he shouldn’t shoulder the bulk of the blame for the evening broadcast’s continued soft ratings.\n\n“Very sad and disappointed. He knew how to ask solid questions. And get interesting people to speak. This is a huge loss for CBS,” the source said.\n\nInsisting that Dickerson wasn’t given enough corporate support to succeed during his short tenure at CBS Evening News, the source added: “It’s like they wanted him to fail.” When Dickerson first replaced O’Donnell, staffers were “super excited” that the show could echo the editorial sensibilities of 60 Minutes and past iterations of the evening broadcast.\n\nWhile Dickerson is the first high-profile on-air talent to leave during the Ellison/Weiss era, his announced departure comes less than two weeks after the news division’s head of standards turned in her resignation. \n\nIn her announcement to staff this month, Claudia Milne – whose father was the CBS News London Bureau editor for three decades – urged the network’s journalists to “keep asking those tough questions” and “to hold the powerful to account.” Much like Milne, Dickerson also has a familial legacy at the network, as his mother was CBS News’ first female correspondent.\n\nPrior to Paramount closing its deal with Ellison’s Skydance Media, Dickerson took a subtle on-air swipe at his then-corporate bosses for settling with Trump and paying him millions of dollars to make the 60 Minutes lawsuit go away.\n\n“Can you hold power to account after paying it millions? Can an audience trust you when it thinks you’ve traded away that trust?” Dickerson pondered while delivering the news about the settlement. He also brought up the merger’s potential role in the agreement with Trump.\n\n“That deal needs Trump administration approval,” he concluded. “The corporation said the settlement of the Trump lawsuit is completely separate from and unrelated to the merger. In the end, Paramount decided to settle a suit it said is without basis in law and fact and an affront to the First Amendment.”\n\nSince Ellison’s takeover of Paramount in August, CBS News has been in the midst of a restructuring that has sparked criticism that the 42-year-old executive – whose father is mega-billionaire and close Trump ally Larry Ellison – is shifting the network’s coverage to the right to appeal to the president.\n\nBesides hiring the “radically centrist” contrarian Weiss and purchasing her “heterodox” digital outlet The Free Press, Ellison has installed a former Trump appointee as an ombudsman to root out “complaints of bias” at CBS News and revamped Face the Nation’s editing rules following complaints from the White House. \n\nMeanwhile, just a year after the evening broadcast underwent a facelift, Weiss has looked to make a splash early in her tenure by potentially bringing in a big name to take over CBS Evening News.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, Weiss has mentioned that she would like to bring in Baier – though it would seem highly unlikely that the Fox News star would decamp from the conservative cable giant. Not only is Baier making $14 million a year, but he is locked into a contract until 2028 – meaning that Fox owners Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch would have to let him out of his deal so he can depart for a network rival.\n\nThe chatter around Baier, however, has sparked additional concern among staff about the editorial direction that Ellison and Weiss have in mind for the network. At the same time, though, Weiss has floated other names to host the nightly news show that wouldn’t be seen as conservative-leaning.\n\nCooper, who also serves as a special correspondent for 60 Minutes, is apparently one target high on Weiss’ list. However, much like Baier, the CNN anchor is locked into a high-dollar contract. Sources have also said that he’s “not interested.” Of course, with Ellison eyeing a Trump-approved takeover of CNN’s corporate parent Warner Bros. Discovery, it is also possible that CBS News and CNN could soon be part of a massive news operation managed by Weiss.\n\nAdditionally, Weiss is also considering bringing back O’Donnell – who has been lobbying hard for the role behind the scenes – to anchor the evening program. CBS Mornings co-anchor Tony Dokoupil, whom The Free Press fiercely defended after the network’s news leaders reprimanded him last year for his combative interview with Ta-Nehisi Coates over Gaza, is also in the mix.\n\nAmid all the ongoing changes at the network, the newsroom is also preparing for looming layoffs, as Ellison has vowed to trim $2 billion from Paramount’s ledger — likely meaning up to ten percent of the CBS News staff will be cut. Those layoffs are expected to be announced this week.","summary":"‘He’s an excellent journalist, good human being, and someone you want in a newsroom,’ one staffer told The Independent about Dickerson’s pending departure.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cbs-news-john-dickerson-departure-reaction-b2853174.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/01/21/Media_CBS_Evening_News_50579.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/fu4LtG4d-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-10-27 18:01:50","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.163},{"id":373120464,"title":"AOC Rallies for Mamdani: ‘They Want Us to Think We Are Crazy — We Are Sane’","text":"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) joined New York City mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani (D) at a weekend rally in Queens, evoking the city’s immigrant roots and calling on supporters to reject claims that their movement is “crazy” or “outlandish.”\n\nOcasio-Cortez, a longtime ally of Mamdani, took the stage Sunday to rally voters ahead of next month’s general election, framing New York City’s diversity and resilience as a foundation for the progressive movement’s platform.\n\n“This city was built by the Irish escaping famine, Italians fleeing fascism, Jews escaping the Holocaust, Black Americans fleeing slavery and Jim Crow,” she told the crowd. “Latinos seeking a better life, Native people standing for themselves, Asian Americans coming together in Queens, in Brooklyn, in the Bronx, in Manhattan, in Staten Island, in this country, in a vision to build the freest, toughest and greatest city on earth.”\n\nDemocrat Party leadership has shifted in response to the growing influence of figures like Ocasio-Cortez and Mamdani. On Friday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) formallyendorsed Mamdani after months of internal division in the party, writing that Mamdani had “explicitly committed to being a mayor for all New Yorkers.” The endorsement came months after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) backed Mamdani, calling him “the best choice for NYC mayor” and praising his “grass-roots movement fueled by everyday people.”\n\nIn her speech, Ocasio-Cortez urged voters to stay firm in their convictions, saying, “We must remember in a time such as this, we are not the crazy ones, New York City. We are not the outlandish ones, New York City. They want us to think we are crazy. We are sane.”\n\nPolling from this summer suggests that Ocasio-Cortez and Mamdani maintain strong favorability among Democrat primary voters. A July survey commissioned by a pro-Palestinian group found that 68 percent of respondents viewed Mamdani favorably, with 75 percent expressing a positive opinion of Ocasio-Cortez. The same poll showed widespread support among Democrats for enforcing an international arrest warrant against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and withholding American weapons from Israel—positions central to Mamdani’s platform.\n\nMamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), has benefited from an electorate increasingly open to socialist ideas. A September survey funded by the Democratic Socialists of America Fund found that a majority of Democrats now identify more closely with socialism than capitalism, with 74 percent expressing that democratic socialism best represents their views.\n\nMamdani’s rise has drawn attention beyond New York politics. On HBO’s Real Time in August, host Bill Maher pointed to Ocasio-Cortez, Mamdani, and Sen. Elizabeth Warren as examples of Democrats who have become major figures in the party’s left wing but “won’t come on” his show. Maher said he has repeatedly invited them, along with Bill and Hillary Clinton and former Vice President Kamala Harris, but all have declined, despite the fact that he “voted for them.” He contrasted their absence with Republicans who, he claimed, “show up and take their beating like a man.”","summary":"Rep.

Ann Selzer for The Des Moines Register, and claimed Harris held a three-point edge over Trump in Iowa, 47% to 44%.\n\nIt was pushed to the headlines just two days before the election.\n\nAnd it was a “stunning” reversal from shortly before, when Trump was confirmed to have a four-point lead.\n\nAccording to a documentation from Americafirstreport.com, “Released just days before voters headed to the polls, the numbers lit up cable news and social media, painting a false picture of momentum for the Democratic ticket in a reliably red stronghold. In reality, Trump crushed Harris by more than 13 points, his widest margin in Iowa yet and the biggest Republican presidential win there since Ronald Reagan’s era.”\n\nTrumps court filing in Polk County District Court charged that the defendants, Selzer, the Register and others, of “brazen election interference” through a “leaked and manipulated” poll intended to sway undecided voters.\n\n“The complaint lays out a pattern of suspicious shifts: sample sizes skewed toward urban areas, questionable weighting that favored younger and minority respondents, and a sudden leak to friendly outlets that amplified the Harris lead without scrutiny,” the report said.\n\nNow the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has cleared the way for the defamation lawsuit to proceed in state court.\n\n“This move strips away what Trump’s lawyers called a shield of ‘unlawful gamesmanship’ by the defendants, forcing them to face accountability where the wrongs took place,” the report said.\n\nThe report pointed out that the huge fail by Selzer, who strangely decided to abandon polling days after this was released, “smacks of something more coordinated, especially given the timing and the media echo chamber that treated it as gospel despite her spotted track record…”\n\nThe report noted, “Her polls have always tended to favor whoever she personally supports.”\n\nThe defendants had tried to move the case from state to federal court, but Trump’s lawyers argued that the federal venue move was a delay tactic as state law governed the claims.\n\nThe 8th Circuit agreed.\n\nThe report noted this case, ultimately, “could crack open doors to similar suits against pollsters nationwide reminding the press that free speech doesn’t license fraud.”","summary":"'Suspicious shifts, sample sized skewed toward urban areas, questionable weighting, and a sudden leak to friendly outlets'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/10/unlawful-gamesmanship-court-clears-path-trump-lawsuit-brazen/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/donald-trump-walking-colonnade-melania-mirror.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 17:43:14","author":"Bob Unruh","authors":["Bob Unruh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.308},{"id":373096882,"title":"DeSantis predicts what would happen if Mamdani wins NYC election: 'Great' for GOP, 'bad for New York City'","text":"Florida Gov.

And I'm not — I can't do that.\" \"I have no idea,\" Newsom said of whether he would decide to run, adding that he has not let academic struggles from across his life prevent him from working to ascend the political ladder. \"The idea that a guy who got 960 on his SAT, that still struggles to read scripts, that was always in the back of the classroom, the idea that you would even throw that out is, in and of itself, extraordinary.

President Donald Trump ultimately swept the seven battleground states and won the popular vote and the Electoral College. GOV. GAVIN NEWSOM REVEALS WHEN HE'LL START THINKING ABOUT A POTENTIAL 2028 RUN Harris also left the door open to a potential 2028 presidential run while speaking with the BBC in an interview that aired Saturday. Harris is a longtime California Democrat who has served as San Francisco district attorney, the California attorney general, and a U.S. senator representing California before ascending the political landscape as the nation's vice president in 2021. \"I am not done,\" Harris told the British outlet. \"I have lived my entire career as a life of service, and it’s in my bones.\" Harris said during the interview that her grandnieces would see the first female president \"in their lifetime, for sure,\" and that she could \"possibly\" be that woman, according to the BBC. Harris brushed off polling that shows her as a 2028 Democrat outsider, saying during the interview that she historically has not listened to polling data. KAMALA HARRIS TO PUBLISH BEHIND-THE-SCENES ACCOUNT OF FAILED 2024 CAMPAIGN \"If I listened to polls I would have not run for my first office, or my second office — and I certainly wouldn't be sitting here.\" The 2024 presidential election threw the Democrat Party into a tailspin as it continues searching for its next de facto leader. Harris published a memoir in September detailing her 107 days on the campaign trail after Biden dropped out of the race, which included a handful of shots at the former president that has caused rifts within the party to grow deeper as it looks for fresh leadership.

'This person summed up Obama's message to Pelosi as, essentially, \"What the f*** did you just do?\"' \n\nPelosi told the former Democratic president: 'That train has left the station.' \n\nThe endorsement had come as a surprise to Obama because he and Pelosi had been in 'regular communication' as it appeared then 81-year-old Biden was nearing the decision to drop out of the race, and 'they agreed Harris should not simply be handed the nomination unchallenged,' Karl wrote. \n\n'Therefore, Obama and Pelosi - arguably the two most influential figures in the Democratic Party - had privately agreed to abstain from making any endorsements,' the longtime ABC News reporter said.\n\nThe president had a shockingly awful debate against Trump on June 27, 2024, followed by an uneven sit-down with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, in which he couldn't say if he had watched his debate performance after the fact. \n\nHe then made several eyebrow-raising gaffes, including calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky 'President Putin' at the NATO summit and referring to Harris a 'Vice President Trump.' \n\nThose fumbles didn't help Biden address mental competency concerns, and then he contracted COVID-19 during a trip to Las Vegas, leaving him so physically frail that it appeared Secret Service agents had to help him get into a black SUV that whisked him to his Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, vacation home so he could recover. \n\nIt was from there that he decided to abort his reelection bid - putting out a statement on July 21 - and then endorsing Harris shortly thereafter. \n\nAround 1 p.m. the next day, Pelosi endorsed Harris, leaving Obama miffed.\n\n'The former president wanted to know what had happened. Why had Pelosi issued a statement endorsing Harris so soon? Hadn't he and Pelosi agreed days earlier that party leaders anointing the vice president as Biden’s replacement would be a mistake?' Karl wrote.\n\nA source close to Obama told Karl that the former president wasn't actually angry at Pelosi over the endorsement, characterizing the conversation as a 'good-natured ribbing.'\n\nBut the source close to the California congresswoman remembered it differently, believing Obama sounded 'genuinely irritated' by Pelosi's move, using the four-letter word to describe the tone.\n\nA senior Biden adviser, who also worked in the Obama White House, told Karl that the real reason Obama didn't want Pelosi to endorse Harris so quickly was that the former president didn't think the vice president could win. \n\n'There's only one Black Jesus,' the senior Biden adviser quipped. \n\nSomeone even closer to Pelosi was also surprised by the former House Speaker's decision: Pelosi's own husband.\n\n'Kamala?' Paul Pelosi asked his wife, Karl reported. \n\n'Don't start with me,' Nancy Pelosi replied in a conversation shortly after her endorsement of the vice president became public.\n\nPelosi had never been a big Harris fan and had privately told Biden in 2020 that she had reservations about him picking her fellow Californian as his running mate. \n\nBut with major Democrats like Bill and Hillary Clinton, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and potential challengers like Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, California Governor Gavin Newsom and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer quickly backing Harris, 'she had no choice,' Karl wrote. \n\n'No other candidates had stepped forward - Kamala Harris was it. The only thing Pelosi could do was try to help her win the election,' Karl said. \n\nObama and his wife, former First Lady Michelle Obama, made the same assessment days later, officially endorsing Harris in a campaign video five days after Biden exited the 2024 race. \n\nKarl's Retribution hits bookstores Tuesday.","summary":"Barack Obama was not pleased that Nancy Pelosi endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris the day after President Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, a new book claims.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15229783/barack-obama-nancy-pelosi-kamala-harris-endorsement.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/10/27/03/103337151-0-image-m-40_1761536250497.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-10-27 15:59:04","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.489},{"id":373073302,"title":"Kamala Harris’s spellbinding shutdown of Laura Kuenssberg was both impeccably courteous and totally devastating at the same time","text":"Laura Kuenssberg has been off interviewing Kamala Harris and it appears – unlike with Boris Johnson – she didn’t accidentally email her the questions in advance.

Her press briefings were a heavyweight bout with the English language. And, when she announced in June she would be writing a book called Independent about having left the Democrat Party, we made a promise we’d read it and fill it with Post-It notes.\n\nThat time has come and it’s far worse than predicted. Jean-Pierre’s book broke no new ground on the inner workings of the White House. Rather, she offered meandering, repetitive excuses for President Biden and denied his cognitive decline. Overall, she penned 172 pages of texts that were comical, insipid, scatterbrained, sloppy, and vapid.\n\nAs others have noted in reviews and Jean-Pierre had said in interviews, she saw nothing cognitively wrong with Biden and rather saw a Democrat Party that both “abandon[ed]” and “betray[ed]” a man with “no scandals,” while also “haz[ing] Harris” that kept a “trailblazing, extremely accomplished” woman from the White House.\n\nIn essence, she argued, America and the Democrat Party failed black women and were uniquely important to our country’s canvass. Why? Because the country had shown an aversion to “repay[ing] what it owes us” for having built the country.\n\nBut her sanctimoniousness started from the dedication: “To those who refuse to sit quietly — May this book remind you that politics isn’t a game played by others, but a compass we each hold in our hands.”\n\nSince this is a media blog, we’ll focus on what she had to say about the liberal media, which she denied were leftists: “[T]hough the GOP often accuses the press of being overwhelmingly liberal, slightly more than half of American journalists say they are independents, according to a 2022 ‘American Journalist’ survey by professors at Indiana University.”\n\nSpeaking to distrust in the national press, Jean-Pierre blamed it on “misinformation and disinformation circulated by right-wing forces” but also the White House press corps’ own “belligerent” attitude.\n\nJean-Pierre whined early in the book that “the press had taken every opportunity to imply Biden was too old or mentally unfit for the job, and I braced for the narrative they’d spin after” the fateful debate.\n\n“All the reporters wanted to talk about was Biden’s age. They were waiting for something to happen because they were looking for something to happen, and the debate performance became their proof,” she huffed.\n\nShe had plenty to say about Fox’s Peter Doocy, including a September 3, 2024 exchange in which he called out Kamala Harris’s code-switching between audiences. Jean-Pierre argued she had to pitch a fit because “my connection to Harris transcended politics” as “two Black women” in power and Doocy’s “disingenuous” questions contained “a thread of racism.”\n\nShowing her purposeful ignorance, Jean-Pierre said code-switching was no different than “sipping a pint of beer at a neighborhood pub.”\n\nDespite that, Jean-Pierre insisted she “got along” with Doocy, who “would often check in with me and reassure me that he was just doing his job” with the tough questions, which she said “I appreciated[.]”\n\nAnother moment was the July 9, 2024 briefing when she “was floored” CNN’s M.J. Lee “tried to trip me up” by simply asking if, in retrospect given Biden’s debate performance, she had regretted her September 2022 statements defending Biden’s mental ineptitude calling out to a dead Republican Congresswoman.\n\nJean-Pierre was incensed years-old statements were fair game and somehow spun her bumbling answers into a girl boss moment (click “expand”):\n\nI told them Walorski had simply been “top of mind for Biden since she had been one of the lawmakers whose efforts led to the health and nutrition conference. Fast forward to post-debate 202 when Lee asked if I still wanted to stick with that answer. Was that what the president actually said, or did I now want to take it back?\n\nI was floored. Despite the many months that had passed, I happened to remember that day clearly. I’d gone to the Oval Office before my daily briefing and Biden said verbatim the three words I later relayed to the press. So, no, I told Lee, I wasn’t retracting an answer I’d given in 2022. She went silent, even shrank a bit into her seat. But I was annoyed. Lee was trying to lure me into a gotcha moment, implying that I couldn’t be trusted to give accurate information. That kind of accusatory tone, that undermining of my credibility, was constantly throughout my two and half years in the top job.\n\n A third post-debate briefing she highlighted was the July 8, 2024 rumble with CBS’s Ed O’Keefe over the administration’s lack of transparency concerning a neurologist’s secret White House visit. Jean-Pierre said O’Keefe’s “attacks on me were so heated and personal” as he wasn’t satisf[ied]” with her word salads about privacy.\n\nDescribing O’Keefe as a “smoldering” individual with questions that struck “a low blow,” Jean-Pierre hid behind MSNBC’s The Last Word host Lawrence O’Donnell, who offered a commentary that night calling O’Keefe “not very good at the respect thing” and were thus handing Trump the White House.\n\nTry and not laugh at this rant claiming the White House press were anti-Biden, but were pro-Trump (click “expand”):\n\nHe concluded with a warning: When the press behaves unprofessionally, it can hinder the flow of truth to an electorate that desperately needs to be well-informed.\n\nI appreciated what O’Donnell said, and not only because he spoke up for me. The mainstream press has an overwhelming responsibility to counter the conspiracies, mistruths, and trolling that are operating in overdrive. But at times they are part of the problem, escalating falsehoods and spin, like The New York Times implying that the President was seeing a neurologist when he wasn’t. And beyond the animosity some reporters directed my way, they also frequently disrespected the president. They would yell questions after he gave remarks as he walked to Air Force One and pretty much any other time he was within earshot. That was in marked contrast to the dference showen to Trump on the campaign trail and during his first term, when many reporters waited patiently to be called on, stood quietly as Trump rambled on, and routinely allowed Trump’s lies to stand without a fact-check or follow up.\n\nIt was what I called the Trump double standard, splashed in our faces once again during his second term.\n\nThere was more: “At least since the era of Spiro Agnew...the GOP has unfairly accused the mainstream media of having a left-wing bias. In response, too many news organizations have twisted themselves into knots trying to prove they aren’t predisposed to progressives, resulting in them grilling Democrats....while softballing conservatives.”\n\nBut as part and parcel of this book’s perpetual flip-flopping, she would pull further on this thread to only change her mind pages later, and again a few pages after that (click “expand”):\n\nThat capitulation became particularly dangerous when it evolved to a “both sides” framing that normalized the behavior of an increasingly authoritarian Republican Party, acting as though its actions were comparable to what was being done by Democrats. They weren’t.\n\nBelief in the media has dramatically diminished in no small part because Trump has spent the past decade smearing the press as an enemy of the people, dubbing any story that highlights his lies or crimes as “fake news.” It’s an accusation brandished by authoritarians throughout history.\n\nIn the midst of such vindictiveness from the Trump administration, the news business also faces tremendous financial pressures. The emergence of free news sites in the early 200s got people used to not paying for information, but journalism is an industry like any other that needs profits for its shareholders and revenue to pay its staff and to fund its work. Advertising...has also migrated online, resulting in many news organizations consolidating, laying off large numbers...or shutting down all together.\n\nWithout naming them, Jean-Pierre spilled ink kvetching over the New York Post’s Steven Nelson and White House colleagues John Kirby and Anita Dunn.\n\nPainting herself as a victim constantly “bullied” for being a black “queer” woman, Jean-Pierre said she declared it a “Machiavellian” effort she constantly had to shake off with numerous stories emerging about her incompetence with the “known right-wing paper” leading the way with the “most outrageous” one alleging she was unprepared for briefings.\n\nJean-Pierre addressed this on multiple occasions, relaying she “spent ours each day doing research” with 13 people assisting her so she “never approached the lectern unprepared.”\n\nExplaining she learned “the person who was planting pieces on me” was a “she” and “should have been my mentor,” she vented how “it was painful to learn that this person was personally leading an effort...relentlessly smearing me behind my back” when Dunn, as a fellow woman, should have had her back.\n\nJean-Pierre offered no concrete explanations for why White House staff wanted her out, but she nonetheless farcically claimed it was because of “my independence” and that Dunn, as an older white woman, could no longer control her once she became Biden’s lead spokeswoman.\n\nShowing how disjointed her book was, she changed her mind over 50 pages later by conceding “I wasn’t at the top of my game right out of the gate” and took “months” realizing “I absolutely needed to find my sea legs,” “anticipat[e] some of the questions I might be asked,” and realize she had to offer corrections.\n\nBut by the very next page, she declared the attacks unfair because she, unlike predecessor Jen Psaki, was a black lesbian and thus had to “void the ‘angry Black woman’ trope.” She provided no evidence, but insisted “black people...intuitively understood” her predicament.\n\nAnd therein sat the problem with nearly every page, passage, or thought in this book.\n\nIn chapter after chapter, she would provide no evidence to support her analysis or jabs. In explaining the negative stories, she settled on racism because that was the best she “came up with.”\n\nAt other moments, Jean-Pierre would voice a thought, but immediately cast it aside for a separate tangent or even contradict herself.\n\nJean-Pierre claimed to be an independent, but ruled out ever voting third-party or for a Republican. She claimed there are good people on the right, but then argued they shouldn’t be seen as friends because they don’t “believe you or loved ones have a right to exist.” She extolled Biden’s preparation, but blamed his debate performance on everything from a cold to jet lag to Hunter Biden’s conviction.\n\nSimply put, Jean-Pierre’s book should have never made it past the first line of edits.","summary":"For years, Biden White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was arguably the most reliable source of entertainment for NewsBusters (and viral posts on X).

I know because I briefed Kamala when she was senator, at this judiciary committee. I said that by opening up the gates, you are allowing child trafficking as a by-product,” Ballard said. \n\n“Harris is hopping around from state to state trying to implement no voter ID laws. They have this dream that Hispanics will come into the country and vote Democrat because the Democrats let them in. But just let them learn English and acclimate because the Hispanic people are, at their soul, conservatives, so that wouldn’t last,” Ballard added. “Kamala, in my opinion, is a war criminal that may not be hit until heaven, but she knew exactly what she was doing. HHS was the most powerful trafficking organization between 2020 and 2024.” \n\nUnder Biden’s administration, nearly 7 million illegal immigrants crossed the southern border into the United States.\n\nBallard left the DHS under the Obama administration, which oversaw similar border policies, after noticing that he could do more to fight child sex trafficking on his own rather than under the umbrella of a bureaucratic government agency riddled with red tape. \n\n“I work for Jesus. There’s no red tape and no deep state. There’s no political pushback, and I can get valuable information that would otherwise be politically challenging for them [the government] to get,” Ballard said. \n\n“We were very limited by jurisdictional mandates. The bureaucracy, and later on the deep state element, was very frustrating. There are many people in the deep state that do not want these things exposed because they’re very much a part of it. So that was a very big thing when I left in 2013,” Ballard added. “It would take five people to approve a mission, and by the time it gets approved, the child traffickers are gone.” \n\nSince stepping down from his government post, Ballard has expanded his fight against child trafficking across more than 30 countries, partnering with international authorities to dismantle global networks of traffickers and pedophiles.\n\nHis independent missions were dramatized in the 2023 blockbuster Sound of Freedom, which depicted “Operation Triple Take,” a coordinated sting that began along the U.S. southern border and culminated in a Colombian hotel raid, rescuing over 100 victims, including 55 children, and leading to the arrest of more than a dozen suspected traffickers.\n\nBallard is now set to release his second movie on Nov. 14, Hidden War, where he takes the fight to hunt down pedophiles and sex traffickers who look to take advantage of the situation that has opened up in Ukraine. \n\nBallard hopes to continue highlighting real-world efforts in the fight against child trafficking and bring this problem up for debate on the federal legislative stage.","summary":"By securing the southern border, President Donald Trump saved the lives of countless child trafficking victims, Tim Ballard, a former special agent for the Department of Homeland Security, devout Christian, and founder of anti-child sex trafficking nonprofit organization the Tim Ballard Foundation, told the Washington Examiner. “Nobody will ever give Trump the credit.

Schumer and a majority of Democrats have voted against a clean funding measure to reopen the government a dozen times — and will vote on a spending bill to end the shutdown for a 13th time as soon as Tuesday. (RELATED: ‘Negotiate With Us Now’: Democrats Demand GOP Bail Them Out Of Schumer-Caused Shutdown)\n\n“It’s time to pass a clean continuing resolution and end this shutdown today,” AFGE national president Everett Kelley said in a statement. “No half measures, and no gamesmanship. Put every single federal worker back on the job with full back pay — today.”\n\n“It’s long past time for our leaders to put aside partisan politics and embrace responsible government,” Kelley added. “A strong America requires a functioning government — one that pays its bills, honors its commitments, and treats its workforce with respect by paying them on time.”\n\nThe AFGE and other federal worker unions have long been seen as a core constituency of the Democratic Party. The union endorsed failed Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024. The AFGE has also been a vocal critic of Trump’s efforts to reduce the size of the federal government.\n\nMonday marks Day 27 of the government shutdown that continues to stretch on despite mounting financial distress for Americans who receive federal paychecks or depend on federal food aid programs, such as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).\n\nThe AFGE letter, first reported by NBC News, comes as a majority of federal workers missed their first full paycheck of the government shutdown on Friday. Many federal workers have taken up temporary jobs and turned to food banks to make up the lost income.\n\nJust three Senate Democrats — John Fetterman of Pennsylvania and Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock of Georgia — voted for legislation to pay essential federal workers and military personnel during the shutdown on Thursday.\n\nFunding for SNAP, which helps feed roughly 42 million Americans, is expected to lapse in at least 25 states this week barring an end to the government shutdown.\n\n“Just open up the whole thing and just cut the shit,” Fetterman told reporters Thursday. “I don’t care about who’s winning, who’s losing, who’s going to blink.”\n\n“They’re right,” House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said at a press conference on Monday, referring to the union’s statement. “It’s a national disgrace what Democrats are doing to good, hard working people, to women, infants, and children, who are just looking to this town to say, ‘What are these Democrats doing?’ What happened to your father’s Democrat Party?”\n\nSenate Democrats, however, show few signs of relenting from their hardball tactics that have kept the government shuttered for one of the longest durations in American history. Schumer continues to demand an extension of expiring Obamacare subsidies — in addition to a bevy of costly left-wing priorities — in exchange for reopening the government.\n\nJust three Democratic caucus members have crossed party lines to vote for the bipartisan spending measure. Republicans must get buy-in from an additional five Democrats in order to clear the Senate’s 60-vote threshold for government funding bills and end the shutdown.\n\nRepublican Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul has consistently voted against the bipartisan funding measure, arguing the bill does not do enough to cut spending.\n\nA spokesperson for Schumer did not immediately respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.
