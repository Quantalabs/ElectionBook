We have to do what's right.'\n\nAssistant Homeland Security Secretary Tricia McLaughlin slammed the reality star for her comment as she doubled down on the Trump administration's assertions that the ICE operations in Los Angeles are targeting convicted criminals. \n\n'@KimKardashian, which one of these convicted child molesters, murderers, drug traffickers and rapists would you like to stay in the country,' McLaughlin posted on X, sharing photos of four individuals she said ICE arrested in recent days from the City of Angels.\n\n'These are just a few of the convicted illegal criminals who have been picked up in the last 72 hours.'\n\nOthers accused the billionaire - who is good friends with Ivanka Trump - of virtue signaling. \n\n'Eh not buying it,' one Reddit user said.\n\n'She needs to call out her friend Trump by name directly if she wants people think she's being genuine. \n\n'These deportations have been going on for years since the first Trump admin and she only decides to speak up when it's convenient, when people will question her silence if she doesn't.'\n\n'Why doesn't she just call up her bestie Ivanka?!' another asked. 'C'mon Kim - get your a** up and WORK.'\n\nA third blasted: 'This is for public perception only. She has a direct line to the Trump/Kushner clan. Wtf is she telling us for? Call up your bestie, Kimberly.'\n\n'She's got Ivanka on speed dial,' a fourth agreed. 'She could easily go that route, if need be.' \n\n'Every time I see Kim K virtue signal I die a little inside,' added another.\n\n'You say \"damned if you do\" as if she's \"doing\" anything,' said a sixth. 'She has a direct line to the Trumps and could call that f**ker out by name if she really cared. But she doesn't. Her words are meaningless.'\n\nA seventh pointed out: 'She has actual ability to do a whole lot more.'\n\nKim has never spoken publicly about who she endorsed in the 2024 Presidential election, in which Donald Trump triumphed over Democrat candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nHowever, she has a close friendship with Trump's daughter Ivanka.\n\nKim and Ivanka's friendship traces back several years, and it only strengthened after the pair began working on prison reforms together.\n\nThe duo first crossed paths in 2014 at the Met Gala, where it was said that they bonded over motherhood.\n\nA source told Us Weekly in 2023, 'Kim and Ivanka have been friends for years and have hung out on a number of occasions.\n\n'They initially bonded nearly a decade ago at the Met Gala over motherhood and being new moms. But they continued to connect numerous times over the years.'\n\nSince their initial meeting a decade ago, the women have been spotted together on numerous occasions.\n\nIn 2018, the pair was seen posing side by side at the White House, where Kim was petitioning Ivanka's father, then-President Trump, to commute the life sentence of drug offender Alice Marie Johnson.\n\nThe duo worked closely together to reduce and clear prison sentences - with Kim often confiding in Ivanka while attending dinner parties at her house.\n\nAnd by 2020, the reality star was gushing about Ivanka's dad online.\n\n'President Trump commuted the sentences of three really deserving women. I didn't hear much about it in the news, so I wanted to share with you their stories,' she wrote on X (formerly Twitter).\n\n'I have the pleasure of spending the day with these women today along with Alice Marie Johnson, who helped to pick these women.'\n\nMeanwhile, the White House has said its deportation efforts in Los Angeles are continuing - despite Kardashian's comments and photos and videos showing protesters wearing face masks confronting police in riot gear.\n\n'The Trump Administration will fulfill the President’s promise to deport illegal aliens and no one – not even violent left-wing rioters – will get in the way of our mission,' White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson told the Daily Mail on Wednesday.\n\n'ICE is arresting illegal aliens and will continue to do so all around the country no matter what radical liberals do, the safety of the American people depends on it,' she said in a statement.\n\n'Radical liberal rioters, enabled by weak politicians like Gavin Newsom, are using violence to try and stop the American people’s agenda from being implemented. It won’t work,' Jackson told the Daily Mail. \n\n'In November, the American people gave President Trump a mandate: deportations.' \n\nAnd according to migrant arrest data exclusively provided to the Daily Mail, ICE's Los Angeles team is continuing to act on the president's orders.","summary":"The Department of Homeland Security joined the growing number of voices hitting out at Kim Kardashian for her criticism of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions in Los Angeles.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14803871/Homeland-Security-turns-Kim-Kardashian-ICE-criticism.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/12/00/99282851-0-image-m-41_1749683696916.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 23:43:15","author":"Editor,Melissa Koenig","authors":["Editor","Melissa Koenig"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":330500920,"title":"New Jersey GOP Gubernatorial Nominee Eyes Judicial Openings and Targets Sanctuary Laws","text":"HOLMDEL, New Jersey—Just a few minutes after telling an enthused crowed of supporters that he is committed to the goal of a “safer, more prosperous, and affordable New Jersey,” Jack Ciattarelli told The Daily Signal that he very mindful of the openings on the state supreme court.\n\n“We have two new appointments,” the Republican gubernatorial nominee said while making his way through a crowd of voters who figured into a decisive primary victory. Ciattarelli, a 63-year-old businessman a former Republican assemblyman, nearly unseated Gov. Phil Murphy, the incumbent Democrat governor, in the 2021 gubernatorial race.\n\nOn Tuesday, he won all 21 New Jersey counties over a crowded field of primary opponents winning more than 67% of the vote. Ciattarelli also received the endorsement of President Donald Trump. In the November election, he will face off against Rep. Mikie Sherrill, a Democrat House member, now representing New Jersey’s 11th Congressional District. While the Democrat primary was more closely contested, Sherrill emerged as a clear winner with more than 34% of the vote.\n\nJudicial appointments are among the several topics where the two candidates are expected to clash. The seven-member New Jersey Supreme Court is widely viewed by policy analysts as one of the most activist in the entire country. Two of its most controversial decisions include the Abbott v. Burke ruling, which involved school funding, and the Mount Laurel decision that dealt with affordable housing.\n\nOn his campaign website, Ciattarelli pledges to “break from the failed tradition of artificially providing partisan balance on the State Supreme Court.” Instead, his focus will be selecting “the best and most qualified nominees (regardless of party affiliation) who will apply the law as written by the legislature, not endeavor to make law that resulted in the failed Abbott and Mount Laurel decisions.” \n\nUnder New Jersey law, the governor nominates and the Senate confirms high court judges. Once confirmed, judges serve for an initial seven-year term. Once that term is up, a governor can then nominate a judge for a tenured position that also requires Senate confirmation. Tenured judges are automatically retired when they reach the age of 70.\n\nMichel Hurtado, the Trenton Republican Party vice chairman, is keen on the idea of breaking with tradition when the opportunity comes to fill expected vacancies on the state supreme court. He spoke with The Daily Signal following Ciattarelli’s victory speech at the Bell Works facility in Monmouth County.\n\n“For too long we’ve had this gentlemen’s agreement regarding appointments to the supreme court to maintain a partisan balance,” Hurtado said. “But it hasn’t served us well. We’ve just ended up with far-left appointments.”\n\nSherrill, a U.S. Naval Academy graduate, Navy helicopter pilot, and former federal prosecutor, has not made any clear statements yet on what kind of judges she would select. Her campaign website does put some emphasis on criminal justice reforms while expressing concern over the “threat of gun violence.” Sherrill has told news outlets she intends to pick an “aggressive” attorney general for the purpose of opposing the Trump administration.\n\nBut Ciattarelli appears poised for battle in the general election. He warned the hundreds of attendees at his victory rally of the coming campaign attacks, saying they should expect to be “Trumped off their a– everyday” since Sherrill “has no plan for New Jersey and can’t run on her own record.”\n\nSanctuary Laws in the Crosshairs\n\nCiattarelli also called out Sherrill for voting in favor of “open borders” as a member of Congress. He was also particularly critical of the fact Sherrill voted against the Laken Riley Act, which requires the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to detain illegal aliens admitting to, charged with, or convicted of theft-related crimes, assaults against police officers, and crimes that result in death or serious injury. Trump signed the bill into law earlier this year.\n\nAs governor, Ciattarelli has said he we would repeal New Jersey’s sanctuary law known as the “Immigrant Trust Directive” designed to shield illegal aliens from law enforcement. He has also pledged to ban municipalities from declaring themselves sanctuary cities.\n\nMaria Bua, a former Mercer County Republican chairwoman, sees law and order questions working to Ciattarelli’s advantage.\n\n“There’s real public fatigue with the lawlessness that comes from illegal immigration in Jersey and across the country,” she said. “You see what’s happening out in Los Angeles and with the foolish stunts Democrats have pulled in Jersey protesting against the detention facility in Newark where dangerous criminals who are also illegal aliens have been held.”\n\nEven so, Bua acknowledges that the Democrats have built in advantages in the Garden State where they hold a 896,350 voter registration advantage over Republicans. She also points to the historical tendency for the party in the White House to lose seats in off year elections. Yet, Trump came within six points of winning the state against former Vice President Kamala Harris in last year’s presidential race.\n\n“I expect a competitive race,” Bua said. “It looks like Jack is going to get help from the national party that he didn’t quite get last time. There’s a feeling New Jersey is in play now and into the future.”\n\nSomeone else in attendance with a long history in the state was former Republican state Sen. Richard LaRossa who represented parts of Mercer County. He expressed some optimism that Ciattarelli could win in November.\n\n“This is a very strong statement with Jack winning all 21 counties,” LaRossa said. “I think Jack is in the best position of any GOP candidate in the past 30 years.”\n\nRocco Riccio, a public school teacher in Trenton, is particularly impressed with Ciattarelli’s position on education. The Republican candidate has expressed support for the expansion of charter schools and other school choice initiatives modeled after Florida’s voucher program. Ciattarelli has also called for a “Parents’ Bill of Rights.”\n\nRiccio takes a critical view of diversity, equity, and inclusion policies that have been implemented in school districts.\n\n“I’ve seen up close how damaging these DEI policies are for students,” he said.\n\nRiccio also cites an alarming figure that he hopes will find its way into the campaign. In a little more than 10 years these figures show, there’s been a paltry growth of about 5% in the number of teachers statewide compared to a 95% growth in administration.\n\n“We need to change direction,” Riccio said. “Now is the time.” The New Jersey gubernatorial election will be held on Nov. 4. Republicans have not won statewide in New Jersey since 2013 when former Republican Gov. Chris Christie was reelected. The last Republican presidential candidate to win the state was George H. W. Bush in 1988.","summary":"HOLMDEL, New Jersey—Just a few minutes after telling an enthused crowed of supporters that he is committed to the goal of a &#8220;safer, more prosperous,...

The reason why, we don’t know. I posit that maybe we are part of a national experiment to determine how far the federal government can go in reaching in and taking over power from a governor, power from a local jurisdiction, and frankly leaving our city and our citizens, our residents in fear.”\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, more than 40 people were arrested on Friday as ICE agents carried out immigration raids and served several search warrants in the parking lot of a Home Depot, and at two Ambience Apparel office locations:\n\nFederal agents served four search warrants and nearly two dozen people were detained outside a Home Depot near MacArthur Park, NBC Los Angeles reported on Friday. The agents also went to two office locations of Ambience Apparel in the downtown area.\n\nIn response to demonstrators throwing rocks at Border Patrol vehicles, vandalizing federal buildings, and setting fire to vehicles, on Saturday, President Donald Trump deployed 2,000 California National Guardsmen to quell the violence.\n\nChief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell revealed in a post on X Monday that the Department of Defense would be “mobilizing an additional 2,000 California National Guard.”\n\n“At the order of the President, the Department of Defense is mobilizing an additional 2,000 California National Guard to be called into federal service to support ICE & to enable federal law-enforcement officers to safely conduct their duties,” Parnell said.\n\nIn response to Trump federalizing the National Guard, Democrats, such as California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D), former Vice President Kamala Harris, and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA), have claimed that deploying the National Guard is a “purposefully inflammatory” move and a “dangerous escalation.”\n\nRep.

The scale of the Republican Party's triumph in November—taking the White House, flipping the Senate, and maintaining control of the House—has sparked soul-searching within the Democratic Party over what went wrong and how to rebuild.The Democratic Party has struggled with unpopularity and internal dissatisfaction since the sweeping defeat, facing pronounced ideological and generational divides, compounded by widespread voter frustration with congressional leaders and the party's overall direction.Democratic leaders have come under criticism from within, some for pushing the party too far left, and others for appearing too conciliatory toward Trump, and a number who have felt disillusioned with its agenda have left the party entirely to either identify as independent or as a Republican.What To Know A Quinnipiac University Poll of 1,265 registered voters nationwide, conducted between June 5 and June 9, found that disapproval of Democrats in Congress has increased since a February poll.Seventy percent of participants said they disapprove of how Democrats are handling their jobs in Congress, while 21 percent approve. Among Democrats, 53 percent disapprove, and 41 percent approve. Just 9 percent of Republicans approve of Democrats' performance, while 84 percent disapprove.A similar Quinnipiac University poll of 1,039 registered voters in February found that 68 percent of participants disapproved of congressional Democrats and 52 percent disapproved of congressional Republicans.The June poll found that 61 percent of participants disapproved of congressional Republicans' handling of their jobs, while 32 percent approved. Among Republicans, 79 percent approve, and 13 percent disapprove. In contrast, only 2 percent of Democrats said they approve of Republicans' handling of their jobs, with 97 percent disapproving.The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.8 percentage points.Other polls, like a May poll from the Associated Press and NORC at the University of Chicago, found that most Democrats are not particularly optimistic about their own party.The poll, which surveyed 1,175 adults nationwide from May 1 to May 5, found only 35 percent of Democrats are optimistic about the party's future, while 36 percent are pessimistic. Twenty-nine percent said they are neither.The latest figures are worse for Democrats than in July 2024, when a poll found that 57 percent were optimistic about the party's future. Twenty-six percent were pessimistic, while 16 percent said they felt neither way.That earlier poll was conducted from July 25 to July 29 among 1,148 adults, just days after former President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 race and endorsed his vice president, Kamala Harris.In the early days of the Harris campaign, many Democrats felt hopeful about her chances of victory, as polls showed her more competitive against Trump than Biden, who had faced growing questions about his ability to lead the country for another four years.Polling showing disapproval with the Democrats comes after party divisions widened in the wake of Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and several colleagues supporting a Trump-backed Republican spending bill, a move that triggered internal backlash and led to calls for new leadership and more aggressive opposition to Trump's policies.However, YouGov's congressional ballot tracker, which tests which party voters would choose in a congressional election, shows that the Democrats are more than 1.5 points ahead of the Republicans, with 43.9 percent to the GOP's 42.6 percent.What People Are Saying John Feehery, a partner at EFB Advocacy, told Newsweek: \"The Democrats are not leading their activists but being led by their activists. And the American people don't like their activists because they are mostly crazy.\"Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, speculated as a potential presidential candidate for Democrats, said in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in May: \"Democrats do not have the best brand around here or in a lot of places. There's a lot of reasons for that. Some fair, and some not fair.\"Former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, in a statement about her book: \"Until January 20, I was responsible for speaking on behalf of the President of the United States. At noon on that day, I became a private citizen who, like all Americans and many of our allies around the world, had to contend with what was to come next for our country. I determined that the danger we face as a country requires freeing ourselves of boxes. We need to be willing to exercise the ability to think creatively and plan strategically.\"CNN pollster Harry Enten said in May: \"These numbers should be a major wake-up call for Democrats. Democrats cannot count their chickens just yet, because those eggs have not cracked at this particular moment.\"What Happens Next Democrats are continuing to work out the direction of the party as they prepare for the 2026 midterms, when they aim to win back voters who shifted toward Trump last year.","summary":"A Quinnipiac University poll shows disapproval of congressional Democrats has increased since February.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/disapproval-rating-democrats-congress-poll-2084270","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2661371/democrats.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 21:59:21","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":330462604,"title":"Los Angeles riots may encourage illegal immigrants to self-deport ","text":"Many continue to regard some top appointments as eccentric. His style of discourse, OFTEN IN ALL CAPS, is eccentric by any past presidential standard. But in a political system that remains democratic and is increasingly demotic, that which sounds coarse to you (and me) is apparently acceptable to most people. \n\nAs for his, um, unusual appointments, they may make sense for a president who is less interested in fine-tuning organizations than in affecting the behaviors of mass publics. \n\nCandidate Donald Trump in 2024 promised that he would eliminate shortfalls in military recruitment, which he attributed to the Biden Pentagon’s “woke” policies. He pointed out accurately that the Army and Navy fell short of recruitment goals by as much as 25% in fiscal years 2022 and 2023. \n\nAs defense secretary, he named Fox News host and military veteran Pete Hegseth, saying he’d promote a warfighting ethos that would attract un-woke young men and women to join up. The Army raised its recruiting goal from 55,000 to 61,000 and reached it in May, four months early. \n\nMaybe that’s a coincidence or a response to other factors. But it looks like Trump’s rhetoric made a big difference.\n\nOr look at trade. Trump has made no secret of his love for tariffs and his desire to reduce trade with China. This week, the Wall Street Journal reported that China’s exports to the U.S. in May were the lowest since Covid-wracked February 2020. It looks like thousands of American and Chinese market participants have made new decisions in response to Trump’s rhetoric. \n\nMeanwhile, the May job numbers in the U.S. increased by a more-than-expected 139,000, despite a 60,000 reduction in federal jobs since January. And despite a drop of foreign-born workers in the labor market estimated between 773,000 and 1,000,000 since March. \n\nThree-quarters of a million to a million — those numbers dwarf the number of annual deportations from the interior of the U.S. as compiled by my Washington Examiner colleague Conn Carroll. \n\nThose range from 65,000 in the last year of the Obama administration and from 28,000 to 47,000 in the four Biden years. They were higher, 81,000 to 95,000, in the first three years of Trump I and then fell to 62,000 in Covid year 2020. \n\nThese numbers put in perspective the drama that has been playing out in Los Angeles this past week. The Trump administration cannot expect that it can, logistically, remove all the untold millions of illegal immigrants that whoever was running the Biden administration (no one, including the authors of Original Sin, has disclosed just who that was) allowed into the U.S. But splashy raids and deportations can get hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of illegal immigrants thinking about what Mitt Romney in 2012 called “self-deportation.”\n\nWhich is probably happening thanks to what has been happening in Los Angeles these past five days. Demonstrations against ICE deportation activity resulted in the arrest of the head of the SEIU, the big government employees’ union. When “sanctuary city” Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) let the rioting go on, Trump nationalized the California National Guard and dispatched Marines. \n\nHe plainly had the authority to do so when federal law enforcement is blocked, and as my Washington Examiner colleague Byron York recounts. And the Supreme Court in 2012 made it clear that federal immigration law prevails over countervailing state law. \n\nThere’s no question whose side the public is on. A pre-riot CBS poll showed 54% approving of Trump’s deportation program, and two polls taken this week showed approval, Insider Advantage by 59% to 39%, and the Napolitan News poll by 58% to 36%. \n\nAfter eight years of stark contrast between Trump and Democrats’ policies, as CNN poll analyst Harry Enten points out, most voters give Trump high marks and “believe that Democrats don’t have a clue on the issue of immigration.” \n\nSimilarly, voters who remember Democrats’ insistence and journalists’ assurances that Joe Biden was fully functional are skeptical that the L.A. rioters were “overwhelmingly peaceful” (Kamala Harris) or “largely peaceful” (the New York Times).\n\nThere’s ample historic precedent for Trump’s action as well. President Eisenhower in 1957 and President Johnson in 1965 sent in federal troops to uphold federal law over the opposition of Democratic governors in Arkansas and Alabama.\n\nThose governors were defying federal law for a cause, preservation of racial segregation, that the vast majority of voters, after a decade of reflection, were determined to reject. Today’s California Democrats are defying federal law for a cause, permanent amnesty for illegal immigrants, which it appears that voters, after a decade of reflection, are bent on rejecting as well. \n\nAs for the illegal immigrants themselves, I’m not aware that anyone has conducted a poll of them, or could, since people in their situation are wary of being interviewed. But as the workforce numbers suggest, for many, self-deportation, together perhaps with the Department of Homeland Security’s $1,000 travel stipend, is looking like a good option. One that may be taken up by many more than are legally deported. \n\nSo “how’s he doin”? Better, perhaps, than his critics think.","summary":"“How’m I doin’?” the late New York Mayor Ed Koch used to ask constituents on his travels through the city.

Almost immediately, Moran's message (a \"clear violation\" of the network's policies, it said) and his dismissal became a flashpoint in the debate over press freedoms and ethics during the Trump administration. And coming just months after ABC parent company Disney agreed to pay $15 million to settle a defamation suit brought by Trump, critics contend that Moran's departure is a sign of corporate capitulation to an administration hungry for boundary-pushing powers.\n\nWhat did the commentators say? \nMoran's dismissal by the network he had called home for nearly 30 years brought reactions \"mostly split along partisan lines,\" said CNN. While \"pro-Trump columnists\" had pushed for his ousting, critics of the Trump administration were \"lamenting\" his suspension and eventual firing.\nCurrently, \"traditional newsrooms don't look kindly on reporters being so outspoken\" as compared to columnists, said Margaret Sullivan, former public editor for The New York Times at her American Crisis newsletter. But given Trump's \"march to autocracy,\" the \"larger question\" is whether \"traditional reporters should have the license — even the encouragement — to say whatever they wish, in whatever way they wish.\"\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

While newspapers need to \"stick to their own ethical standards,\" excessively punishing Moran as \"some sort of peace offering to Trump is wrong — as wrong as settling the libel suit earlier this year.\"\n\n\"Whether or not\" you believe Moran's post was true, or that he had the \"right to express his thoughts,\" the real \"issue at hand\" is that his comments are being \"used by the right to accuse, once again, the media of bias,\" said Tom Jones at Poynter. White House opprobrium and threats toward ABC demanding consequences for Moran's comments are a \"textbook example of 'jawboning,'\" said Robby Soave at Reason. This is when the government \"tries to accomplish some censorship by threatening improper government action.\"\nBut by exposing his \"true feelings about key figures within the Trump administration,\" Moran's post \"wasn't a partisan critique on policy matters, but a full-blown personal attack\" on the people he'd been tasked to cover with \"impartiality” and “objectivity,\" said Shawn Fleetwood at The Federalist. As such, merely suspending him for the offense would be an \"insufficient punishment.\"\nSome members of this administration were more concise with their reactions: \"Talk shit, get hit,\" said White House adviser Steven Cheung on X in response to Moran's firing. Moran's words were \"unhinged and unacceptable,\" said White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on X, calling his post a \"rampage.\"\nWhat next? \nMoran's firing will be \"celebrated by conservatives\" and \"condemned by others,\" said Jones. While he has since taken down the X post at the heart of this episode, Moran has \"not repudiated it,\" said NPR. Broadly, the incident suggests that \"prohibitions\" on reporters sharing personal opinions across social media \"seem increasingly outdated,\" said Soave. The expectation that journalist should \"conceal their perspectives\" seems \"quaint and not exactly useful.\"\nOusting Moran is \"another win\" for an administration that has \"aggressively attacked mainstream media outlets for their coverage of the president,\" said Politico. Not only does the firing come soon after Disney's $15 million settlement with the White House, but Trump also has an ongoing $20 million lawsuit against CBS over that network's 2024 election interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, which the network is reportedly considering settling.\n\nExplore More\n\nToday's big question\nDonald Trump\nStephen Miller\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nRafi Schwartz, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nRafi Schwartz has worked as a politics writer at The Week since 2022, where he covers elections, Congress and the White House.

Trump took the settlement toward establishing a “Presidential foundation and museum to be established by or for Plaintiff, as Presidents of the United States of America have established in the past.”\n\nThis week, ABC News opted not to renew its contract with Terry Moran after his online rant against White House Deputy Chief of Policy Stephen Miller.\n\n“It does not mean that we are without fault.

At the time, Trump claimed the edits made to Harris’s interview were “the biggest scandal in broadcast history: they actually took her answer out and gave her a different answer after it was shot.” The network said the interview was edited for time purposes but not doctored.\n\nCostas has long criticized Trump, calling him “by far the most disgraceful figure in modern presidential history.” Trump has not yet responded to Costas’s most recent remarks.","summary":"Former NBC sports analyst and CNN contributor Bob Costas blasted ABC News and CBS News for &#8220;running the gauntlet that the Trump administration will throw up against them,&#8221; during an award speech Monday.

Susan Collins next year.\n\nCostello, who ran unsuccessfully last year as a Democrat against Independent Gov. Angus King, said he’s running to “end the Trump Administration’s and Republican Congress’s reckless assault on our democracy, environment, and economy.”\n\n“Senator Collins, aside from expressing concern, has done little to prevent the Trump Administration and her Republican colleagues from undermining our economy, our critical government programs, and our nation’s long-standing defense of democracy against authoritarianism and aggression,” Costello said in a written statement.\n\nCollins chairs the powerful Senate Appropriations Committee and has used her influence to pushback and in some cases reverse unilateral funding and program cuts by the Trump administration, which she has described as “illegal,” since it’s being done without congressional approval.\n\nCollins also has a split record on Trump’s most controversial cabinet members. She voted against Pete Hegseth as Defense Secretary and Kash Patel as FBI director, but supported Tulsi Gabbard as director of National Intelligence and vaccine-opponent Robert F. Kennedy , Jr. as secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDemocrats believe Collins is vulnerable this year. She’s the only Republican running in a state won by Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024 presidential race. But recent polling has shown her approval rating on the rise, Collins has defied the odds before.\n\nThe 65-year-old Brunswick resident is the third Democrat to formally declare a run against Collins, who is seeking a sixth, six-year term in the Senate.\n\nJordan Wood, a 35-year-old Bristol resident, declared his candidacy in April and has been holding town hall events across the state. Wood is a former chief of staff for U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif, and founder of democracyFIRST, a Democratic Super PAC.\n\nNatasha Alcala has also declared a run. She also filed paperwork to challenge King last year, but never qualified for the ballot.\n\nGov. Janet Mills, meanwhile, has been facing pressure from national party leaders to take on Collins, especially after her high-profile clash with President Trump at the White House over transgender student athletes, which has been used to raise money. Mills says she’s neither planning to run, nor has she ruled it out.\n\nAnd House Speaker Ryan Fecteau, D-Biddeford, is also considering a run, though he is currently trying to wrap up the legislative session, which is scheduled to end next Wednesday.\n\nOther candidates who have filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission include independent Phillip Rench and Republicans Carmen Calabrese and Daniel Smeriglio.\n\nCostello has decades of experience in government, but his candidacy against King, who routinely tops the polls as Maine’s most popular politician, never caught traction with Democrats.\n\nCostello placed third with about 11% of the vote, behind King, who received 52%, and Republican Demi Kouzounas, who received 36%.\n\n“In 2024, I campaigned to strengthen our democracy and bolster the federal government’s ability to address such pressing challenges as climate change; lack of affordable housing and health care; economic inequality; and insufficient retirement security,” he said. “These are challenges the Trump Administration and Senator Collins and her Republican colleagues are either ignoring, or worse yet, exacerbating.”\n\nIn a news release, Costello said his work experience includes having held a high-level position at US AID, where managed foreign aid in Cambodia, Haiti, Bosnia, Serbia and Kosovo. He has also worked as a senior aide to the Maine Secretary of State, the mayor of Baltimore and the governor of Maryland, as well as Deputy and Acting Secretary of the Maryland Department of the Environment.","summary":"David Costello, 65, says he's running to 'end the Trump Administration’s and Republican Congress’s reckless assault on our democracy, environment, and economy.'","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/06/11/brunswick-democrat-announces-campaign-for-susan-collins-senate-seat/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/39877100_20241003_david-costello_7-1749656741.jpg?w=753","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 15:34:26","author":"Randy Billings","authors":["Randy Billings"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.12},{"id":330378784,"title":"White House mocks Newsom address, accuses governor of hiring Harris', Biden's campaign manager","text":"The White House took several jabs at California Gov.

In response, White House assistant to the president and director of communications Steven Cheung accused Newsom of spending time creating the video rather than serving as governor.

This is about you. California may be first, but it clearly will not end here. Other states are next. Democracy is next. Democracy is under assault before our eyes.\" White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller also responded to one of Newsom's posts on X late Tuesday evening after the governor said the Founding Fathers did not \"live and die to see this moment,\" and urged for peaceful protests. Meanwhile, Miller shared a photo of a shirtless man standing on a vehicle and waving a California flag in front of fumes with the comment: \"According to Governor Newsom, this is what the Founders were fighting for.\" Trump has gone head-to-head with Newsom over the deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles following protests sparked by ICE arrests in the city on Friday. HEGSETH DEFENDS NATIONAL GUARD LA DEPLOYMENTS, SAYS ICE AGENTS MUST BE PROTECTED While Trump has argued the National Guard troops are necessary to prevent destruction in Los Angeles, Newsom said most of the troops \"are sitting, unused, in federal buildings without orders.\" Additionally, Newsom argued that the move violates state sovereignty because governors typically oversee National Guard troops.

Trump has clashed with California leadership, including Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, over his decision to send in National Guard troops and Marines to quell the protests. His authority to send in the troops has faced some pushback, though Trump reportedly cited Title 10 of the U.S. Code on Armed Services in a memo, which gives the president authority to deploy troops if the United States is “invaded or is in danger of invasion by a foreign nation,” or if there is a “rebellion or danger of a rebellion against the authority of the Government of the United States.” Newsom, in a televised address on Tuesday, slammed Trump as “a president who wants to be bound by no law or constitution, perpetuating a unified assault on American traditions.”\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nKhaby Lame, a content creator who is the most-followed person on TikTok, was detained by immigration authorities in Las Vegas on Friday, the Department of Homeland Security confirmed to Forbes. Lame, 25, was born in Senegal and raised in Italy and is an Italian citizen. Lame was granted voluntary departure by DHS and chose to leave the country, the department told Forbes. Lame’s exact whereabouts are unclear, but as of early Wednesday, he has posted multiple Instagram stories from São Paulo, Brazil. Lame has more than 162 million followers on TikTok and ranked as the tenth highest-earning creator in 2024, with more than $20 million in earnings, according to Forbes estimates. Bo Loudon, a pro-Trump influencer who is friends with the president’s son Barron, claimed on X he reported Lame to authorities as an illegal immigrant.\n\nKardashian, who in recent years has worked toward becoming a lawyer and completed a law apprenticeship program in May, has met with the White House numerous times over the past several years to discuss prison reform, including with Trump during his first term. Kardashian reportedly pressured Trump to grant clemency to Alice Marie Johnson, who was sentenced to life for a nonviolent drug offense, in 2018, and lobbied for the First Step Act, which aimed to reduce prison sentences, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent drug convictions. Kardashian met former Vice President Kamala Harris at the White House last year, where she also met with former prison inmates who had sentences commuted by former President Joe Biden.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nLos Angeles Protests Live Updates: Anti-ICE Protests Spread To New York, Philadelphia, Chicago And More (Forbes)\n\nTikTok's Top Star Khaby Lame Flees U.S. After Trump's ICE Crackdown—Whereabouts Still Unknown (Forbes)\n\nAs immigration raids continue, ICE protests spread coast to coast (NBC News)\n\nGot a tip?

What I think he's doing is he is baiting liberals and liberal governors like Gavin Newsom into taking the bait and adopting rhetoric that he thinks will be divisive and damaging ahead of the midterms.\n\nSo, what he wants to happen is he wants Newsom and Democrats to start chanting things like “defund ICE” and “defund the police.” Cause we know that that hurt Kamala Harris, we know it hurt Tim Walz. They had to run away from those previous positions. And he’s trying to create that sort of stand off right now.\n\nBut here’s the problem, most Americans oppose rioting. That's just across the board.

Trump authorized the deployment after protests began on Friday, June 6, 2025, following the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) apprehending 44 individuals in the city for immigration violations, Al Jazeera reported.The deployment immediately drew condemnation from California Governor Gavin Newsom, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, former Vice President Kamala Harris, and many other senior Democratic leaders.They described the deployment of the National Guard to confront the protesters as a provocation aimed at escalating tensions in the second-largest city in the United States.What is Meant by the National Guard?According to the Council on Foreign Relations website, the National Guard is a unique branch of the U.S. military that serves the state and federal governments. Normally, the National Guard is activated to respond to state-level emergencies such as hurricanes or wildfires.However, unlike most other military forces, the Guard can also be assigned to domestic law enforcement duties. If necessary, the president can deploy the Guard for foreign missions, as seen in Afghanistan and the Horn of Africa.The Guard has two main components: the Army National Guard and the Air National Guard. Although both are considered reserve forces, they differ from the regular Army and Air Force reserves.The National Guard Bureau, headed by a four-star general who sits on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, oversees the National Guard at the federal level.In fiscal year 2023, the National Guard had 430,040 members, organized into fifty-four separate units in each state, Washington, DC, and three U.S. territories: Guam, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.This includes the Army National Guard, which consists of 326,317 soldiers, and the Air National Guard, which has 104,974 members.Most National Guard members work part-time, balancing military duties with civilian jobs or education. They typically train one weekend every month and serve several weeks annually, with most members stationed in their home state.All enlistees in the Guard must undergo basic training. After that, they attend regular training. Typically, training takes place one weekend each month. Every year, members undergo training for two weeks.What is the History of the National Guard?The National Guard's roots can be traced back to the colonial era, when colonies in America formed militias based on the British tradition of citizen soldiers defending their communities. The Massachusetts Bay Colony formed the first militia regiment on December 13, 1636. After the United States was established, these state militias persisted. This reflects the balance between state and federal powers established in the Constitution.It wasn't until the early 1900s, particularly after the Militia Act of 1903 and World War I, that the Guard transformed into a more organized force equipped with full gear. This era also clarified the relationship between state and federal authority over the Guard.Who Leads the National Guard?Typically, the governor of a state controls their respective National Guard units, but the president can activate the National Guard in certain situations. (The DC National Guard always falls under federal command.)The president can call the National Guard for various reasons, from responding to natural disasters to supporting military operations abroad. State-level missions are typically short-term, while federal deployments can last for a year or more.In international deployments, Guard units often train and serve under active-duty task force commanders, performing the same duties as regular military personnel. However, administrative matters usually remain under state control. Sometimes, the federal government funds a deployment that remains under state command. This was the case during the pandemic.When is the National Guard Deployed?Typically, if a U.S. state is in a state of emergency that requires the deployment of the National Guard in response, the governor of the state can mobilize the troops stationed there.However, the president can activate the National Guard from a state, but this usually requires the governor's approval.The National Guard is deployed in the event of natural disasters or severe weather, civil unrest, war, or when election assistance is needed. For example, around 50,000 National Guard troops were deployed in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina hit several southern states.In January, Newsom deployed the National Guard when wildfires ravaged several areas in Los Angeles. In recent years, National Guard troops in civilian clothing have been stationed at polling places during elections.However, during the current protests, Trump deployed National Guard forces in Los Angeles without Newsom's approval.Robert Cohen, a history and social studies professor at New York University, told Al Jazeera that Trump's decision to deploy the National Guard without seeking Newsom's approval was \"wrong, but typical of Trump's biased way of tarnishing almost all of his major decisions.\"What Controversies Involve the National Guard?Disputes over who has the authority to deploy the National Guard between the US president and state governors are not unique to the present. There have been several disputes, particularly during periods of civil unrest.While governors can use the National Guard for temporary law enforcement, presidents are generally constrained by the Posse Comitatus Act unless they use the Insurrection Act. Presidents like Eisenhower and Kennedy used this law to enforce civil rights decisions in the South.Debates about the use of the military domestically resurfaced in 2020 during national protests. President Trump threatened to deploy the military under the Insurrection Act, but instead called governors to send their National Guard units to Washington, DC. This move was criticized for being overly forceful and legally questionable. The response to the Capitol riots in January 2021 was criticized for being slow, partly due to the unique federal control over the DC National Guard.At the southern border, the deployment of the National Guard faced criticism for a lack of authority to enforce immigration law and poor working conditions, especially in Operation Lone Star in Texas. Supporters argued that the deployment was necessary to support border patrol efforts.President Trump's declaration of a national emergency at the border in 2025 allowed for developing additional National Guard troops, raising concerns about the blurred lines between civilian policing and military action.In 2023, the involvement of the Air National Guard in intelligence operations came under scrutiny after a young member, Jack Teixeira, was arrested for leaking classified documents. This incident prompted calls for reform in handling sensitive information and raised questions about access to military intelligence within the National Guard.Editor's Choice: California Governor Sues Trump over Sending National Guard to Los AngelesClick here to get the latest news updates from Tempo on Google News","summary":"President Trump deployed the California National Guard to Los Angeles amid immigration protests, sparking a feud with the state's governor.","url":"https://en.tempo.co/read/2016648/understanding-national-guard-role-in-the-los-angeles-riots","image":"https://statik.tempo.co/data/2025/06/09/id_1404400/1404400_720.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 11:51:44","author":"Ida Rosdalina","authors":["Ida Rosdalina"],"language":"en","source_country":"id","sentiment":0.174},{"id":330344686,"title":"Trump warns of 68% tax hike if budget bill fails. Not true, say experts","text":"US President Donald Trump has been sounding an alarm: if Congress doesn’t pass his tax and spending bill, Americans will be forced to pay much higher taxes.\n\nReferring to his wide-ranging tax and spending legislation called the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” Trump said in a June 5 Truth Social post, “If this bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% tax increase.”\n\nTrump cited the same figure in May 25 comments to reporters and during a May 30 news conference.\n\nHowever, independent analyses of the controversial bill – which would extend the 2017 tax cuts that are slated to expire later this year – found that Trump’s estimate is about 10 times bigger than the expected increase would be if the cuts expire.\n\nThe budget bill has caused a split between Trump and his close aide, Elon Musk, who called it a “disgusting abomination”.\n\nThe White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.\n\nHow much would taxes be expected to increase?\n\nRepublicans have largely advocated for extending the full 2017 law. Democrats – including the party’s 2024 presidential nominee, then-Vice President Kamala Harris – have generally supported extending the lower tax rates only for families earning up to $400,000 a year.\n\nIf the 2017 tax bill sunsets, taxes would rise for most taxpayers. But the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, has estimated, on average, Americans’ taxes would rise by about 7.5 percent if the 2017 tax cuts fully expired, not 68 percent.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center didn’t find any single income group, whether lower-income or higher-income, that would see a 68 percent tax hit if the law expired.\n\nTaxpayers earning up to $34,600 could expect a nearly 12 percent increase, and taxpayers earning $67,000 and up could expect a 7 percent to 8 percent increase.\n\nTaxes would rise for all income groups if the bill fails, but not by the 68 percent\n\nThe centre-right Tax Foundation hasn’t calculated an estimate, but the group made broadly similar projections as the Tax Policy Center, said Garrett Watson, the Tax Foundation’s director of policy analysis. Watson said the 68 percent figure is much higher than estimates he has seen from credible experts.\n\nIt’s possible that Trump’s 68 percent figure is a garbled reference to a separate statistic, tax experts said.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center estimated that just over 64 percent of taxpayers would see taxes increase if the law expires. That percentage varies based on the household income. Many low-income households would see no change, often because they don’t earn enough to pay federal income taxes. But for households making $67,000 or higher, there’s a roughly 80 percent likelihood of a tax increase.\n\nAbout 62 percent of taxpayers will see a tax increase if the bill is not renewed\n\nSimilarly, the Tax Foundation said 62 percent of taxpayers would pay higher taxes if the 2017 law lapsed.\n\nNone of this, however, means that the increase for the typical taxpayer would be more than 60 percent compared with what they paid in taxes the previous year.\n\nThe Republican tax bill generally reduces taxes for lower and middle-income groups while benefitting wealthier taxpayers the most, the Tax Policy Center found.\n\nThose earning $34,600 or less would see their after-tax incomes rise by 0.6 percent if the Republican bill passes, while those earning $67,000 or more would see a 2.8 percent increase. The boost would be even stronger for the top 5 percent of earners, the top 1 percent of earners and the top one-10th of 1 percent of earners.\n\nHigher-income groups would gain more if the 2017 tax law is renewed\n\nA Tax Foundation February analysis found higher gains among all income groups, especially when factoring in expected economic growth from the lower taxes. But the same pattern held – the biggest percentage gains from passing the Republican bill went to the top 5 percent and 1 percent of earners.\n\nTrump said if his “Big Beautiful” tax and spending bill doesn’t pass, “there will be a 68 percent tax increase.”\n\nIf the 2017 tax law is not extended, independent analyses show that taxes will increase, but by far less than what Trump said.\n\nThe Tax Policy Center projects that the increase would be about 7.5 percent overall. The Tax Foundation broadly agreed with that assessment.\n\nWe rate the statement False.","summary":"Think tanks say the tax might rise by 7.5 percent if the ‘Big Beautiful Bill’ does not pass, rejecting Trump&#039;s claims.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/11/trump-warns-of-68-tax-hike-if-budget-bill-fails-not-true-say-experts?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/AP21211635815457.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 11:50:57","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.453},{"id":330305030,"title":"Los Angeles Is Now A Battle Ground Between Trump’s Federal Govt And Mexican Immigrants","text":"By T N Ashok\n\nLOS ANGELES: Los Angeles, the city of angels (Mexican), is on fire on Reality TV playing to the advantage of the master of the Apprentice show and Art of the Deal as the city of Hollywood battles the federal government over its powers to federalize the state national guard on matters of crime and policing as it rides roughshod in its pursuit of illegal immigrants keeping an election pledge that brought the Republican Party led by Donald Trump to power In 2024 November elections.\n\nIt all started with ICE – Immigration Customs Enforcement – agents storm trooping popular shopping centres such as Home Depot to whisk away Latino workers considered illegal immigrants with an alleged criminal record.\n\nThe situation was exacerbated when a very popular union leader, David Huerta , leader of several unions in the state, was detained and hurt besides an Australian got shot in an overtly armed excessive use of force by the national guard which was federalized without the consent of the state governor who belongs to the Democratic Party..\n\nThe state of California has sued the federal government for its alleged illegal action as the 10th amendment in the constitution forbids the federal government to interfere in a state’s law and order situation, which is a state subject, by federalizing the national guard against the state overruling its powers.\n\nThe city has been on fire as protesters against Trump’s immigration policy have torched cars, vandalised public places provoking Trump to federalise the national guard and deploying 700 special marines from the army to quell the riots as he seeks to push through his agenda against aliens on which he was voted to power. The federal guard action using weapons to control the riots is going live on TV as a reality show much to the advantage of the Republican supporters who support Trump on his agenda.\n\nThe upcoming gubernatorial battle in New Jersey is another testing ground for Trump’s 2nd term endorsement from the people in a largely blue state where governor Democrat Phil Murphy cannot contest again as he has exceeded his term.\n\nTrump in 2024 elections stormed into the bastion of the two blue states New Jersey and California reducing the Democrats margin but failed to stake the states. White House officials say that Trump has a mandate to carry out his hard-line immigration agenda and that politically, battling it out with a blue state is a winning issue for them.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s immigration agenda has met a groundswell of opposition in Los Angeles, the country’s second-largest city. California, which was carved out of the erstwhile larger Mexico, has a dominant immigrant population consisting of latinos mostly from Mexico.\n\nThe White House has retaliated threatening to arrest California’s governor Gavin Newsom and mobilized Marines to support National Guard troops in defending federal property — even though state officials say they don’t want the assistance and are now suing the administration.\n\nFor the White House, this scene — Trump battling a blue state over his signature issue — is a political win, officials said. It’s a nationally watched saga on live TV, of the sort that has long defined his career: a made-for-TV moment. Trump’s Art of the Deal and Apprentice show playing larger than life on nationwide Television, he is enjoying every moment of it as it fuels groundswell of support for his actions from the GOP supporters.\n\n“We’re happy to have this fight,” a White House official said, emphasizing that politically, the administration sees it as a winning issue. Democrats and immigration activists have broadly blasted the Los Angeles operation as illegal and inhumane and insisted that it’s all about politics — and not about sound public policy.\n\n“This Administration’s actions are not about public safety — they’re about stoking fear,” former Vice President Kamala Harris, a Los Angeles resident who ran against Trump last year, wrote in a statement.\n\nBut Trump allies argue that it’s simply Trump carrying out the hardline immigration agenda that was the centrepiece of his campaign. NBC News spoke with four White House officials, in addition to other Trump supporters, who requested anonymity to speak candidly.\n\n“This is what America voted for, period,” a Trump adviser said. “This is the America First focus that got the president elected and is driven by nothing else than what he promised American voters.” “Look at the violence, the attacks on law enforcement,” the adviser added. “If Democrats want to support that, let them. This is why we win elections, and they do not.” Trump advisers also pointed to the fact that the president’s immigration policies continue to get high marks in most public polling.\n\nTrump advisers say the president also points to the fact that he got more votes in California in 2024 than in his previous campaigns, even though he still badly lost the heavily Democratic-leaning state. The administration’s response to the protests does seem to have one eye on the reaction in conservative media, a space increasingly dominated by pro-Trump influencers.\n\nThe Trump adviser, asked about McGraw’s involvement, said: “This is an important moment in American history. People have a right to see it in a way not unfairly skewed by a biased mainstream media.” The adviser wouldn’t elaborate on how McGraw, whose presence was first reported by CNN, was able to have front-line access to the federal immigration operations. A spokesman for McGraw didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nRepublicans more broadly also see the fight as a political winner and say Democrats are functionally taking the bait on an issue in which polling has given Trump an advantage. “I think it is a symptom of how far left this party has done when you have major Democrats standing on the side of illegal aliens that are torching vehicles,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis told Fox News on Monday. “It is one of the reasons the Democratic Party is struggling so much nationally,” he added.\n\nMatthew Bartlett, a Republican strategist and former Trump administration official, said the raids shouldn’t be a surprise because immigration is a “legitimate issue” the voters have signalled they care about. “There is no political upside in defending or denying the images of burning cars, rioters and looting and the destruction,” he said of Democrats. “\n\nA feeling that things have spun out of control in California and that the government can’t effectively govern. … It has changed the conversation from illegal immigration to a breakdown in society. (of law and order)”. Still, there has been some disagreement — at least in public messaging — about how far to push in going after California Democrats, a break between what may be politically popular with the base and what’s politically realistic.\n\nThe clearest example centres on the Trump administration’s authorizing the deployment of National Guard troops over the opposition of California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass have argued that inserting National Guard troops will inflame tensions and potential violence — a response that has led Trump to signal he would consider arresting Newsom if he were to continue what the administration considers to be his interference.\n\n“I would do it if I were Tom,” Trump said, referring to his “border czar,” Tom Homan, the head of ICE overseeing the operations in LA. . “I think it’s great. Gavin likes the publicity. But I do think it would be a great thing.” While detaining Newsom would no doubt please Trump’s MAGA base, White House officials privately say it’s not currently in the cards. “It’s not being actively planned or considered,” a senior White House official said. “But anyone who breaks federal law puts themselves at risk of being arrested. That’s just a basic fact.”\n\nA second White House official said that if either Newsom or Bass, a former Democratic congresswoman, do something at odds with federal immigration law, they could be detained. But the official also acknowledged that the optics of arresting California officials amid an immigration fight they believe most Americans support could backfire with some Republican voters because, at the moment, it doesn’t appear they have actually broken any immigration laws.\n\nOn Monday, California sued the Trump administration, arguing that Trump’s federalizing the state’s National Guard is “unlawful.” “Let me be clear: There is no invasion. There is no rebellion,” Democratic state Attorney General Rob Bonta said. “The president is trying to manufacture chaos and crisis on the ground for his own political ends. Federalizing the California National Guard is an abuse of the president’s authority under the law — and not one we take lightly. We’re asking a court to put a stop to the unlawful, unprecedented order.”\n\nHowever, Trump supporters have lined up behind him, with some even offering to head to Los Angeles to help, despite having no law enforcement experience. “Preparing to deploy … to Los Angeles,” vocal Trump supporter Benny Johnson said on X. He followed up with a post to his 3.7 million followers showing him wearing military-style gear with his name on it. The battle between the MAGA Republicans led by President Trump and the Democrats led by California Governor is on and it is not ending shortly as Trump has a political agenda.

That brings the total Soros funding to $8,300,000 over just the past couple of years.\n\nThe Soros-backed group’s latest initiative involves working “with state and county parties to recruit candidates and sign up volunteers, starting with a series of organizing rallies in June. Organizers plan to visit more than two dozen cities in July to recruit candidates,” according to The Journal. Texas Majority PAC Deputy Executive Director Katherine Fischer told the newspaper that “‘If a win is on the table in 2026, we don’t want to leave it there by not being organized.’” She continued: “‘There is no choice for Texas or for anyone else in the country who wants to see a Democrat in the White House after 2032 but to find a pathway through Texas.’”\n\nWhen looking at Democrats’ track record in the Lone Star State, it makes sense why the Soros machine is working overtime to change its fortunes there, as The Journal noted:\n\nDemocrats haven’t won a statewide election since 1994, and Trump generated his largest margin of victory in Texas last year, defeating former Vice President Kamala Harris by nearly 14 percentage points. Republicans have won every presidential election in Texas since 1980, and the last Democratic U.S. senator to win an election in the state was Lloyd Bentsen in 1988.\n\nSoros may indeed be 94, but the dark \"open society\" empire he passed to his son Alex is not showing any signs of slowing down soon in its goal to defeat conservatives and overhaul politics both in the U.S. and abroad. The news about Texas Majority PAC’s scheme comes on the heels of MRC Business’s latest investigation in coordination with Bongino Report highlighting how the Soros machine allocated at least a whopping $618,895,617 collectively between 2016 and 2024 toward exploiting the issue of climate change alone to reshape the world into an eco-utopia. \n\nThe thought of Texas becoming the bright, shiny, new conduit of the extremist Soros agenda is indeed a very chilling thought.

Tim Walz and two Democratic fellow governors will face orchestrated attacks from some of the fieriest hard-right lawmakers in Congress who accuse their high-profile witnesses of harboring dangerous criminal aliens.\n\nThursday’s hearing on “sanctuary states” will be held by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which is headed by Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., a Trump loyalist and political attack dog who is weighing a run for governor.\n\nThe high-profile hearing will be held against the backdrop of the unrest touched off by federal immigration actions in Los Angeles, which prompted President Donald Trump to send in National Guard troops and Marines to try to quell the disturbance, moves opposed by California Gov. Gavin Newsom. \n\nComer leads a panel that includes some of the most fractious Freedom Caucus members among its members, including Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Lauren Boebert of Colorado.\n\nThe panel has also attracted some feisty Democratic lawmakers, too, including Reps. Jasmine Crockett of Texas, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Ro Khanna of California. So, testy exchanges are expected to characterize the hearing.\n\nWalz has riled the GOP by touring the nation, holding town halls in districts of Republican House members who have stopped hosting these in-person events after colleagues were faced with angry constituents.\n\nAnd Walz has been more combative than he was when he stumped for vice president as Kamala Harris’ running mate.\n\nSo, fireworks are expected at Thursday’s hearing on “sanctuary” states, during which Walz is expected to maintain that Minnesota is not a “sanctuary” state and is not in violation of any federal laws.\n\n“Governor Walz is happy to work with Congress, but since Minnesota is not a sanctuary state, one can’t help but wonder if this is, perhaps, politically motivated,” Teddy Tschann, a spokesperson for Walz, said in an emailed statement.\n\nRelated: Walz says Trump is destroying the federal government. Where does that leave Minnesota? \n\nThe Trump administration has classified a wide range of state and local policies as “sanctuary” behavior.\n\nIt has demanded that American cities allow federal immigration agents access to prisons and that they provide advance notice when prisoners wanted on an immigration detainer are being released.\n\nBut in a legal opinion, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison determined that, unless accompanied by a court order, a request to detain an immigrant are requests, not commands, which federal courts around the country have recognized.\n\n“Because no Minnesota civil law authorizes immigration detainer arrests, Minnesota law enforcement agencies risk significant civil liability if they enforce immigration detainers,” Ellison said.\n\nEllison also determined that the 10th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which reserves all powers not given to the federal government to the states, prohibits the federal government from commandeering state and local officials to enforce federal regulatory programs.\n\nThat could put the state at odds with the Trump administration, which has required cities and states to certify compliance with a federal law, known as Section 1373 of the Aliens and Nationality Act.\n\nThat law says states and localities can’t bar local officials from communicating with immigration authorities about the citizenship status of an individual.\n\nWalz will be accompanied at the high-profile hearing by outside counsel, and the governor will also bring a prepared statement.\n\nRep. Tom Emmer, R-6th District, who as majority whip is part of the GOP House leadership, slammed Walz, who supported the expansion of state-funded health care to the undocumented and sarcastically wished him “good luck” at the hearing. \n\n“From hurling outrageous insults against ICE agents to offering a multitude of taxpayer-funded benefits to illegal aliens in Minnesota, Tim Walz’s immigration agenda can be summed up easily: pro-illegal alien, anti-Minnesotan,” Emmer told Fox News Digital on Monday.\n\nEmmer also said “if Tim Walz thinks he will be able to defend his abysmal record before Congress, then he’s even more of a buffoon than I thought. I only have one thing to say to Timmy as he heads to Washington this week: GOOD LUCK.”\n\nHearings often more smoke than fire\n\nComer spent much of the last Congress promoting sinister-sounding allegations against former President Joe Biden and his son Hunter, as well as other members of the Biden family.\n\nHis many hearings on what he called the “Biden crime family” propelled him to stardom among MAGA voters who were bent on bringing the former president down. Earlier this month, Comer said he is broadening an investigation into the extent of Joe Biden’s physical and mental decline while in office.\n\nHe’s also investigating Harvard for “unlawful discrimination” against Jewish students, the Democratic fundraising platform Act Blue for possible fraudulent foreign donation and liberal-leaning non-profit organization for what Greene has called “corruption.”\n\nComer’s focus in this Congress has also shifted to immigration and he’s targeted Democratic elected officials, many of whom, like Walz, have been considered possible contenders for the White House in 2028. \n\nAnd this is not the first time Comer has tried to investigate Walz.\n\nWhen Walz was running as Harris’ running mate, Comer requested information from the FBI about the governor’s many trips to China, most of them made when he was a high school teacher. Comer was looking for any links Walz might have to the Chinese Communist Party, but he was not awarded with any kind of smoking gun from the FBI.\n\nAs fact-finding efforts, many of Comer’s investigations fizzled and his hearings were known more for their heated exchanges and platforms for conspiracy theories than attempts to collect new information.\n\nComer has had a bumpy ride in this Congress, too. For instance, his first hearing on sanctuary jurisdictions, held March 5, backfired.\n\nComer and his GOP colleagues on the oversight committee planned an attack on Democratic mayors from New York, Denver, Chicago and Boston, cities that tout municipal laws that protect undocumented migrants. The Republican lawmakers sought to portray the Democratic-led cities as havens for criminal activity and foreign gangs.\n\nBut the Democratic mayors used the occasion to amplify their arguments about immigration and urban safety.\n\nBoston Mayor Michelle Wu, who brought her one-month-old infant to the hearing, said it was the Trump administration’s “over-the-top“ tactics that jeopardized safety for Americans.\n\n“This federal administration is making hard-working, tax-paying, God-fearing residents afraid to live their lives,” Wu said. “A city that’s scared is not a city that’s safe, a land ruled by fear is not the land of the free.”","summary":"The testimony of Walz and two other Democratic governors in Washington, D.C., is expected to devolve into testy exchanges over the treatment of immigrants.\n\n\nThe post Walz readies for coordinated GOP attack in hearing over ‘sanctuary’ policies appeared first on MinnPost.","url":"https://www.minnpost.com/national/washington/2025/06/walz-readies-for-coordinated-gop-attack-in-hearing-over-sanctuary-policies/","image":"https://www.minnpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Walz.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 11:00:00","author":"Ana Radelat,Shadi Bushra","authors":["Ana Radelat","Shadi Bushra"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":330442732,"title":"A country music Maga thanked the Lord Kamala Harris wasn’t president right now and was owned into next year","text":"We hadn’t come across John Rich before but apparently he is something of a country singing star – one half of Big and Rich! – and a Maga.

That was the message shared by David Rhodes, executive chairman of Sky News and the former CBS News president, and Almar Latour, CEO of Dow Jones and publisher of The Wall Street Journal, both part of News Corp, during an appearance at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit in London on Wednesday.\n\n They spoke in a session, which was live-streamed and entitled “Media, Machines, and Mayhem: Truth as a Competitive Advantage.” \n\n “There is a failure of imagination” when it comes to a vision for AI, Rhodes argued. “Right now, we talk about generative AI and talk about answers to prompts, and we think only about text. But what’s really important to us is to be a design partner with all of the firms … on what it looks like when something much more compelling happens, which is when these models come for video. We do want that design partnership.” \n\n Of course, the appropriate business and financial models for AI companies to use media content remains a key focus and issue of debate. “We also want to advocate for good terms of trade, for how our information, how our results turn up in answers to those prompts,” Rhodes said. “We need to not repeat what were, the errors of the news media in approaching Web 1.0 and even Web 2.0 and social media where big mistakes were made.”\n\n Latour echoed that when sharing his company’s approach to AI. “We want a commercial arrangement with all the AI platforms. That’s the foundation of it. Information has value, and we need to, through a market mechanism, arrive at that value,” he emphasized. Highlighting that Dow Jones spends $1.7 billion every year “to perform the little miracle that is the Wall Street Journal and all of our other information,” he highlighted that nobody can expect to “take all of your productivity from this year… give it away for free, move it into the AI machine,” and take 130 years worth of archives without appropriate pay. “We’re not going to let that happen. We need fair value for that, or otherwise, there’s not going to be any news,” the CEO concluded. \n\n He didn’t mince words in his follow-up comments. “So we want to strike commercial arrangements. If you do not agree to that, you are a thug, and we’ll come after you like a common thief,” Latour shared. “We will see you in court, and we will argue our case. And that may sound belligerent, but it is a necessity.”\n\n Rhodes on Wednesday didn’t comment on the litigation brought by U.S. President Donald Trump against CBS News over how 60 Minutes edited his former opponent Kamala Harris’ answer to a question. The two sides have been in mediation talks to try and resolve the suit, with Paramount reportedly to have offered $15 million to resolve the suit. The Federal Communications Commission is also reviewing the interview via its “news distortion” purview while also reviewing CBS parent Paramount Global’s deal to sell to Skydance Media. \n\n So, is there press freedom in the United States right now? “Yes, there is press freedom,” replied Latour. “I get asked this question all the time, particularly when I’m traveling abroad. Our journalists can freely report, and our opinion writers are free to share their free markets, free people philosophy richly.”\n\n He continued: “There is a free debate. The President, of course, and the administration is free to respond to that, and the decibel level has gone up. But I think there should not be hysteria.” Concluded Latour: “The tension between an administration and established media, or other media, is common. We got clobbered when the Wall Street Journal did a front page story on President Biden’s cognitive decline, and that was not very comfortable. The decibel level has definitely gone up.”\n\n That conclusion wrapped up the session. “In a world where seemingly every voice has a platform, where narratives can make or break a business, and where public trust in corporations and institutions has rapidly eroded, the mission of global news organizations has never been more vital – or more complex,” its description said.","summary":"The former CBS News president and Almar Latour spoke at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council Summit in London about the topic of \"Media, Machines, and Mayhem: Truth as a Competitive Advantage.\"","url":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/sky-news-dow-jones-ceo-ai-thug-media-deals-us-press-freedom-1236262297/","image":"https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/David-Rhodes-Executive-Chairman-Sky-News-Group-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 09:58:54","author":"Georg Szalai","authors":["Georg Szalai"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.019},{"id":330275256,"title":"Trump and Musk’s feud timeline: From Epstein allegations to Elon’s olive branch","text":"On Friday May 30, President Donald Trump handed his close aide and “first buddy” Elon Musk a golden key to the White House, praising the work the tech billionaire had done for his administration.\n\n“Elon gave an incredible service,” Trump said in a joint press conference with Musk last week. “There’s nobody like him.” \n\nThat press conference was intended to mark the end of Musk’s 130 days as a special government advisor, leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) in slashing excess federal spending.\n\nAlthough there had been some disagreements during Musk’s time in the role – the Tesla owner made it clear he was not a fan of Trump’s tariffs, for instance – the event seemed to mark a conciliatory end to their working relationship.\n\nBut there were rumblings: Musk, whose whole purpose at DOGE had been reducing federal expense, was deeply opposed to Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill,” fearing it would ramp up the national debt over the next 10 years.\n\nWhile White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt had successfully managed to spin their difference of opinion as an example of healthy debate for a couple of days, everything came to a head on Thursday June 5.\n\nHere’s a timeline of how the very public fight between Trump and Musk unfolded, which appeared unresolvable until Musk offered a grovelling apology six days later.\n\nWriting on X, Musk says: “I’m sorry, but I just can’t stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork-filled Congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it: you know you did wrong. You know it.”\n\nHe continued: “It will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America (sic) citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.”\n\nTwo days later, things escalated dramatically. \n\nIn an Oval Office appearance with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz, Trump said he was “very disappointed” by Musk’s comments.\n\n“Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here,” Trump told reporters. “Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will anymore.”\n\nTrump added he “would have won Pennsylvania easily anyway,” without Musk’s help.\n\nMusk posts a slew of tweets to X, in one of which he rebuts Trump’s point about Pennsylvania, arguing: “Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate.”\n\nIn another, he asks, “Where is this guy today??” in response to a tweet of screenshots from the president’s previous criticisms of increasing the debt ceiling.\n\nHe then tweeted: “The Big Ugly Bill will INCREASE the deficit to $2.5 trillion!”\n\nThis is shortly followed by a new suggestion from Musk: “Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?”\n\nThis post was still pinned to the top of the X owner’s timeline for several days thereafter. \n\nResponding to MAGA blogger Laura Loomer on X, who was commenting about the divide amongst Republicans over the fight between Musk and Trump, the billionaire said: “Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years...”\n\nThe president says that Musk was “wearing thin” in a series of posts on his social media platform.\n\n“I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump said.\n\nHe then added: “The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!”\n\nRetweeting a screenshot of Trump’s EV mandate comment (alluding to the Big, Beautiful Bill scrapping a $7,500 tax credit for EV customers, which would impact Tesla), Musk said: “Such an obvious lie. So sad.”\n\nMusk tweeted: “Files linked to the investigation of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have emerged as a point of fixation for Trump and his allies and right-wing media figures.\n\n“Time to drop the really big bomb: Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public.”\n\nShortly after, he wrote: “Mark this post for the future. The truth will come out.”\n\n“In light of the President’s statement about cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately,” he tweeted.\n\nAnother X user replied, urging Musk to “cool off and take a step back for a couple of days.” Musk replied: “Good advice. Ok, we won’t decommission Dragon.”\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social: “I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It’s a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. \n\n“If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn’t create this mess, I’m just here to FIX IT. This puts our Country on a Path of Greatness. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nMusk retweets an X user, who said: “President vs Elon. Who wins? My money's on Elon. Trump should be impeached and JD Vance should replace him.”\n\nMusk tweets: “The Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year.” \n\nThe point echoes a warning issued by many of the president’s critics, from economists to pundits, but most notably his former presidential rival Kamala Harris.\n\nMusk tweets: “Call your Senator, Call your Congressman, Bankrupting America is NOT ok! KILL the BILL.”\n\nMusk’s last repost for the day came from an X user, who said: “This is why Republicans will likely lose the House in 2026 and then Democrats will spend two years investigating and impeaching President Trump. \n\n“Trump and the Republicans in Congress need to deliver. We want budget cuts. We want agencies shut down. We don't want big govt.”\n\nThe following day, West Wing aides briefed the media that the two men were planning a private phone call to clear the air, only for the president himself to tell reporters that he had no interest in speaking to the man who had donated at least $288m to his election campaign just months earlier, leaving their once-close relationship in limbo.\n\nTrump told Jonathan Karl of ABC News he was “not particularly” interested in talking to Musk and said to Dana Bash of CNN: “I’m not even thinking about Elon. He’s got a problem.

At one time, he was considered by executives as a potential evening news anchor in the mold of the late Peter Jennings.\n\nJust six weeks ago, Moran had interviewed Trump, earning acclaim from many of his peers for gently pressing the president over his false claims about a man deported by the administration to El Salvador. Trump, irritated, told Moran in the middle of the exchange that he had \"never heard of you.\"\n\n\"You're not being very nice,\" Trump said, suggesting Moran should not push back given the \"big break\" he had been given in getting the sit-down interview.\n\nIn December, the Walt Disney Co., ABC's corporate parent, agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Trump as a private citizen last fall over repeated assertions by anchor George Stephanopoulos that Trump had been found liable for rape in a civil trial. In fact, Trump was found liable for sexual abuse in a civil trial in New York City. (Disney agreed to pay $15 million to a foundation for Trump's eventual presidential library and $1 million for legal fees incurred by his lawyers.)\n\nParamount Global, the parent company of CBS, is in talks to settle another lawsuit filed by Trump as a private citizen over his ire at the editing of a 60 Minutes interview of then Vice President Kamala Harris during last fall's presidential campaign. Corporate officials believe that failing to strike such a deal could provoke federal regulators to hold up a sale of the company valued at $8 billion to the son of tech titan Larry Ellison, a Trump backer.\n\nHistorically, for a White House to tie up corporate transactions over personal or ideological pique would be considered a scandal. Trump often advertises the possibility: he threatened Elon Musk's government contracts during their recent falling out.\n\nIn Moran's case, White House officials including Vice President JD Vance and Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt denounced Moran and called for him to be punished or fired.\n\nMoran took down the post but has not repudiated it.\n\nIn his post over the weekend on Musk's social media platform X, Moran said that Deputy White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller \"is a man who is richly endowed with the capacity for hatred.\"\n\n\"[Y]ou can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment,\" Moran continued.\n\nBy contrast, Moran argued, Trump's hatred was \"only a means to an end\" — \"his own glorification.\"\n\nLeavitt, the White House press secretary, said Moran \"went on a rampage\" and called his remarks \"unhinged and unacceptable.\" She said the White House had asked ABC how it planned to hold Moran accountable.\n\nEven as journalists acknowledged Moran's comments were inappropriate, some also cautioned that administration officials should not dictate actions by news outlets.\n\nMargaret Sullivan, a columnist on politics and media for the left-leaning Guardian US, wrote on Substack that Moran should be suspended but not fired.\n\nRobby Soave, senior editor of the libertarian Reason magazine, called Leavitt's actions \"censorship adjacent.\" He wrote that the White House press secretary is \"trying to pressure ABC News to censor Terry Moran over his (admittedly a bit questionable) tweet.\"\n\nMoran's post and the controversy that subsequently surrounded it took colleagues by surprise. In his time at ABC, Moran was considered careful in his reporting and measured in his analysis. If anything, Moran was thought to be more conservative and more willing to outwardly acknowledge his religious faith than many peers, according to three former colleagues at ABC. (They asked for anonymity to speak given the sensitivity surrounding Moran's ouster by the network.)\n\nABC did suspend Moran over the weekend but by Tuesday concluded that – despite his 28 years at the network — he could not return.","summary":"In dropping veteran correspondent Terry Moran, ABC News said his post calling President Trump \"a world-class hater\" was \"a clear violation of ABC News policies.\"","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/06/11/nx-s1-5429827/abc-fires-terry-moran-trump-stephen-miller-world-class-hater","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x576+0+0/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F39%2F7b%2F5dc287ae46c9a2a64ad118903643%2Fterry-moran-ap-photo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 09:00:00","author":"David Folkenflik","authors":["David Folkenflik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":330276370,"title":"Trump proves a blowhard on Ukraine","text":"Last week we marked another anniversary of D-Day, the landing by Allied troops at Normandy, launched to liberate Europe from its murderous occupation by fascists. Thousands of young soldiers died in the initial phases of the campaign to free Europe; many thousands more would die before the Nazis surrendered.\n\nHistorically, June 6 is a date commemorated by American presidents, who point out how proud Americans should be to have stood up against tyrants. This year, not so much. Our sitting president, a convicted criminal who escaped with only 34 felony convictions by dint of the royal flush of political good fortune, used his family wealth to dodge the draft and has mocked those who in his view were foolish enough to have lost their lives serving their country. Having declared that he looked forward to being a “dictator” on day one of his second presidency, he has spent his first five months showing that, when he said he had absolute power as president, he meant it.\n\nSo as we pass June 6 and steam toward July 4, it’s an awkward time for Americans to tout their past. Our current president’s support for Russian totalitarian Vladimir Putin’s attempt to violently strangle Ukraine — support not merely tacit but explicit, not merely rhetorical but operational — has stained America darkly. Celebration of America has been supplanted by shame.\n\nSay this about Neville Chamberlain, the weak-kneed British Prime Minister who thought that by appeasing Adolf Hitler and handing him Czechoslovakia he could “make a deal” with him: there’s no evidence that Chamberlain liked and admired Hitler or wished him well in his future endeavors. By contrast, Donald Trump has made it crystal clear that he thinks highly of Putin, and believes that Ukraine, the victim of Putin’s aggression, has somehow brought Putin’s invasion on itself. It is a level of twisted that is hard to fathom, let alone untwist.\n\nReversing President Joe Biden’s masterful orchestration of international military support for Ukraine, Trump cut off American military support and ended the crucial intelligence sharing so vital to Ukraine’s self-defense. When totalitarians smile and their victims weep, it’s a sorry time.\n\nThat’s the large story. The lesser story is barely a story at all, which is Trump’s relentless BS-ing of Americans about how he not only knew how to end the war started by Russia but that he was going to do it before we could even say the words “bone spurs.” CNN has documented 53 separate times during the last presidential campaign when Trump boasted that if elected he would end the war with Putin before even taking office or, at the very latest, “on day one” of his presidency. It’s month five of Trump 2.0, and Russia, which is attacking Ukrainian civilians nightly as it occupies more and more Ukrainian territory, continues on, safe in the knowledge that America’s president won’t lift a finger to stop it.\n\nAmerica bought Trump’s con-artistry hook, line and sinker. CNN was right: Trump’s blowharding about his nonexistent plan to end the war was a staple of his testosterone-suffused windbaggery during the campaign, and it was always the same.\n\n“I’ll get that done within 24 hours,” Trump told one rally about ending the war. “Everyone says ‘Oh, no, you can’t.’ Absolutely I can. Absolutely I can.”\n\n“I know Zelenskyy. I know Putin. It’ll be done within 24 hours, you watch,” he told another crowd. “They all say, ‘That’s such a boast.’ It will be done very quickly.”\n\nHere was Trump during his debate with Biden: “I will have that war settled between Putin and Zelenskyy as president-elect before I take office on Jan. 20. I’ll have that war settled. ... I will get it settled, and I’ll get it settled fast before I take office.”\n\nAnd here he was during his debate with Kamala Harris: “I will get it settled before I even become president. I know Zelenskyy very well and I know Putin very well. I have a good relationship, and they respect your president. OK, they respect me; they don’t respect Biden.”\n\nWhen it comes to Trump and Putin, it’s not so much the lying as the appeasement that’s the story. But journalist Bill Moyers was right when he observed “A democracy can die of too many lies.” Best we absorb this before it’s too late.","summary":"When totalitarians smile and their victims weep, it's a sorry time.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/opinion/columnists/trump-proves-a-blowhard-on-ukraine/article_24e77693-dcc8-40f3-aa67-3a6b8fd645d4.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/da/0da5ad27-6614-44a9-b716-4ae66c78f0d7/68485d35168f9.image.jpg?crop=1609%2C845%2C0%2C221&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 09:00:00","author":"Blox Content Management,By Jeff Robbins","authors":["Blox Content Management","By Jeff Robbins"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":330234604,"title":"Q+A follows The Project onto the scrap heap – so where to now for non-traditional current affairs?","text":"Two long-running television current affairs programs are coming to an end at the same time, driving home the fact that no matter what the format, they have a shelf life.\n\nThe Project on Channel 10 will end this month after 16 years, and after 18 years on the ABC, Q+A will not return from its current hiatus.\n\nEach was innovative in very different ways.\n\nQ+A was designed specifically to generate public participation. Its format of five panellists, a host and a studio audience of up to 1,000 was a daring experiment, because the audience was invited to ask questions that were not vetted in advance.\n\nThis live-to-air approach gave it an edgy atmosphere not often achieved on television. From time to time, the edginess was real.\n\nIn 2022, an audience member made a statement supporting Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and repeated Russian propaganda to the effect that Ukraine’s Azov battalion was a Nazi group that had killed an estimated 13,000 people in the Donbas region.\n\nAfter a brief discussion of these allegations, the host Stan Grant asked the man to leave, saying other audience members had been talking about family members who were dying in the war, and he could not countenance the advocating of violence.\n\nIn 2017 the Sudanese-Australian writer Yassmin Abdel-Magied was involved in a fiery exchange with Senator Jacqui Lambie over sharia law.\n\nThey had been asked by an audience member if it was time to define new rules surrounding migration to avoid community conflict, to which Lambie replied: “Anyone that supports sharia law should be deported.”\n\nAbdel-Magied questioned if Lambie even knew what that meant, before getting into a heated defence of feminism and Islam.\n\nIn 2024, an audience member listening to politicians on the panel debate family violence could not contain his frustration, calling out: \n\nHow dare you go into politics, in an environment like this, when one woman is murdered every four days, and all you […] can do is immediately talk about politics? That is just disgraceful.\n\nHis outburst went viral.\n\nHe had put his finger on what was an increasing problem with the program. It became hostage to fixed political positions among those of its panellists drawn from party politics.\n\nAs a result, it became predictable, and although the surprise element supplied by audience participation remained a strength, the panellists’ responses increasingly became echoes of their parties’ policies.\n\nWhile the objective no doubt was to achieve a range of perspectives, it began to look like stage-managed political controversy.\n\nThis is not to criticise the established presenters – Tony Jones, who fronted the program for 11 years, Stan Grant and most recently Patricia Karvelas, all gifted journalists who adroitly managed the time bombs occasionally set off in their midst.\n\nUnfortunately, especially for Grant, the program was a lightning rod for attacks on the ABC by The Australian newspaper. ABC management’s abandonment of him, after a particularly vicious attack in 2023 over his commentary during coverage of the king’s coronation, was disgraceful.\n\nResigning from the program, Grant said: “Since the king’s coronation, I have seen people in the media lie and distort my words. They have tried to depict me as hate filled. They have accused me of maligning Australia. Nothing could be further from the truth.”\n\nThe ABC is promising to continue with audience-participation programming along the lines of Your Say, a kind of online questionnaire which the ABC says was successfully tried during the 2025 federal election.\n\nHow such a format would translate to television is not clear.\n\nMeanwhile at Ten, there is promise of a new current affairs program, but details are scant.\n\nThe Project will be a hard act to follow. It promised “news done differently” – and it delivered. News stories were given context and a touch of humanity by a combination of humour, accidents, slips of the tongue and the intellectual firepower of Waleed Aly.\n\nAly is a Sunni Muslim, and his “ISIL is weak” speech in 2015 spoke directly and passionately to the fears of the public at the peak of one of the many panics over terrorism.\n\nInevitably, much of the attention in the wake of the announced closure has been on the celebrated gaffes of long-time presenter Carrie Bickmore, a little rich to be reproduced in a sober article such as this, but findable here. \n\nIt may not be an auspicious time for launching a new current affairs program at Ten. Its ultimate parent company, Paramount, in the United States, is in the process of negotiating a settlement with US President Donald Trump over a trumped-up court case in which the president is suing the company for US$20 billion (A$30.7 billion).\n\nHe says an interview done by another Paramount company, CBS News, with the Democrats’ former presidential nominee Kamala Harris during the election campaign was “deceptively edited”.\n\nThis is said to have no prospect of succeeding in court, but Paramount wishes to merge with Skydance Media and fears the Trump administration would block it if the company doesn’t come across. The Wall Street Journal is reporting it is proposing to settle for $15 million.\n\nSenior editorial staff at CBS have already resigned in protest at Paramount’s cowardice, so what price editorial independence at Ten?","summary":"Both long-running shows have launched memorable and powerful TV moments.

From the earliest years of the republic to the modern era, contested outcomes, allegations of fraud, and constitutional ambiguity have repeatedly tested the resilience of American democracy.The latest case, allowed to proceed in New York’s Rockland County, challenges the validity of several voting machines used in the 2024 election. Filed by SMART Legislation, the lawsuit alleges that votes for Kamala Harris were undercounted or missing entirely from machines in towns like Ramapo. Affidavits from poll workers and voters suggest ballots showed zero votes for president while including votes for other contests, raising concerns about possible machine malfunctions or tampering.Also read: Kamala Harris election result: Trump's victory under scrutiny as lawsuit filed - here's what could happen nextThis case, while unlikely to affect Donald Trump’s presidency, brings renewed focus on electoral transparency and echoes the legacy of past presidential contests that reshaped US election law and public trust.From Jefferson to Bush: six disputed presidential electionsIn 1800, the Electoral College delivered a tie between Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, both receiving 73 votes. The House of Representatives required 36 ballots to award the presidency to Jefferson. The deadlock prompted the Twelfth Amendment, which separated presidential and vice-presidential votes to avoid future stalemates.A similar issue surfaced in 1824 when Andrew Jackson secured the most popular and electoral votes but lacked a majority. The House chose John Quincy Adams instead, triggering Jackson’s accusations of a “corrupt bargain.” His eventual win in 1828 led to reforms demanding greater voter participation and scrutiny of elite political deals.Abraham Lincoln’s 1860 victory with only 40 per cent of the popular vote triggered Southern secession. His win, reflecting a deeply divided electorate over slavery, came despite his absence from ballots in several Southern states. The dispute ultimately cascaded into the Civil War, underscoring how electoral fractures can deepen national crises.Also read: Kamala Harris voters ‘erased’ in Rockland? New York lawsuit to probe vanishing ballots: What we know so farIn 1876, Democrat Samuel Tilden won the popular vote and led in the Electoral College, but 20 electoral votes from four states were contested. A bipartisan commission awarded them to Republican Rutherford B. Hayes. In return, Hayes agreed to withdraw federal troops from the South, a deal known as the Compromise of 1877. This political resolution ended Reconstruction and enabled state-level disenfranchisement of Black voters.Fast forward to 1960, John F. Kennedy’s razor-thin win over Richard Nixon raised concerns over vote manipulation in Illinois and Texas. Allegations pointed to organized political machinery in Chicago and strategic ballot management in Texas. Nixon declined to challenge the result, citing national unity, though doubts persisted.In 2000, George W. Bush and Al Gore’s battle hinged on Florida’s 25 electoral votes. Machine errors like “hanging chads” and inconsistent ballot designs such as the “butterfly ballot” caused major confusion. The US Supreme Court halted recounts in Bush v. Gore, awarding Florida, and the presidency, to Bush by a margin of just 537 votes.Rockland County lawsuit: new scrutiny on voting machinesThe Kamala Harris election result lawsuit centers on irregularities in Rockland County, where five voting machines in Ramapo reportedly recorded zero presidential votes despite ballots including selections for down-ballot races. Voters and poll workers submitted affidavits confirming they cast votes for president.Also read: Kamala Harris won the U.S elections: Bombshell report claims voting machines were tampered with before 2024Election integrity advocate Susan Greenhalgh cited the rarity of such discrepancies, questioning whether software updates made before the election contributed to machine errors.

The case’s next hearing is scheduled for September 22, 2025.What the Kamala Harris election result case could meanWhile the lawsuit is unlikely to affect the 2024 presidential outcome, it may influence broader election reforms.

Speaking from the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump defended the deployment of 4,000 National Guard troops and 700 Marines to Los Angeles, where demonstrators have clashed with law enforcement in recent days. “This is the first—perhaps of many,” Trump said. “If we didn’t hit this hard, you'd see the same thing erupt across the country. But let me be clear: If others try this, they’ll be met with equal or greater force.” The president added that his administration would not tolerate violent protests targeting ICE operations and vowed strict enforcement of deportation policies. Notably, Trump had floated the idea of using military force in Democrat-led cities during his 2024 campaign, proposing federal intervention to combat unrest or gang violence. “In cities where there’s been a total breakdown of law and order, I won’t hesitate to send in federal assets, including the National Guard, until safety is restored,” he said at the time.According to The New York Times, nearly 5,000 troops are already present in the Los Angeles area. Reuters reported that 700 Marines were in a staging area in Seal Beach, about 30 miles south of the city, awaiting specific deployment orders. As of Tuesday, 2,100 National Guard members had been activated in the region—more than half the planned total. Both Marines and National Guard personnel are restricted from making arrests and are tasked solely with protecting federal facilities and personnel.

Every week, Cooper shares her interviews with major A-listers, including former Vice President Kamala Harris, model Hailey Bieber, singer Demi Lovato, and more.\n\nCooper is now at the height of her career after signing an even bigger contract with Sirius XM in 2024.\n\nHere’s everything we know about Cooper's success, from how much she’s made through her podcast to what she’s said about her finances.\n\nWhen Cooper left Barstool Sports in 2021, she signed a three-year agreement with Spotify, bringing Call Her Daddy to the music streaming service. According to Variety, that deal was worth $60 million — Spotify’s biggest deal for a woman-led podcast at the time. \n\nIn 2022, the Los Angeles Times reported that Cooper was the highest-paid female podcaster on the platform, with an annual salary of $20 million. \n\nIn August 2024, she signed a $125 million, three-year deal with SiriusXM to replace Spotify as her distribution and advertising partner. The deal also included rights to every existing and future show in Cooper’s Unwell Network, which she owns with her husband Matt Kaplan, such as Hot Mess, Pretty Lonesome, Boyfriend Material, and upcoming titles.\n\nIn October 2024, Forbes ranked Cooper as No. 8 on its Top Creators list, noting that she brought in $22 million from her endeavors.\n\nAccording to the finance magazine, Cooper also sold $800,000 worth of Call Her Daddy merchandise within three days of its release in November 2020.\n\nSince her rise to fame as a podcast host, Cooper has signed some major partnerships with brands like Jimmy Choo and Kim Kardashian’s shapewear company, Skims. \n\nLast year, she partnered with Peacock and hosted a watch party for the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. Her series was titled Watch with Alex Cooper, with special guests at the games offering their commentary and insight. \n\nIn March, Cooper’s network, Unwell, announced its collaboration with the National Women’s Soccer League. The collaboration made Drink Unwell, the network’s beverage line, the official partner of the professional soccer league.\n\n“This felt like the perfect fit for Unwell as we remain committed to not only supporting our community but celebrating women who are doing incredible things,” Cooper said in a press release at the time.\n\nDuring an April 2025 appearance on reality star Harry Jowsey's Boyfriend Material podcast, Cooper claimed she once turned down $8 million for a brand deal because she didn’t “stand by it.”\n\n“I just like didn’t believe in putting my face next to it,” she said. “I think it’s important to say no to s***, because then you just lose your f***ing credibility.”\n\nCooper bought her Los Angeles estate for $10.7 million in 2022, according to Architectural Digest. The property, located in Studio City, consists of two separate houses on two separate parcels. \n\nThe largest of the two houses is 5,300 square feet, while the smaller guesthouse is about 1,600 square feet. In total, the two homes have six bedrooms and six and a half bathrooms. \n\nMonths after announcing her SiriusXM deal, Cooper revealed that she also bought a home for her mother and father in Los Angeles, since they were moving out of her childhood home in Pennsylvania. \n\n“​​To be able to go to my parents… and be like, 'I want to buy you guys a house and I want to do this for you. And I’m so excited to be able to do this for you, and I want nothing in return. I just want your happiness and I want you guys to enjoy it and thrive and maybe babysit sometimes if I have kids. It’s such a cool feeling,” she said during a December episode of Call Her Daddy.\n\nCooper has spoken openly about her SiriusXM deal and her financial success. During an interview with The Hollywood Reporter in October, she said that while the money from the network was a big deal, it wasn’t the only reason she agreed to work with them. \n\n“Don’t get me wrong, it is life-changing. You want to make money off the product that you’re spending so much time on. But I started making content when I was five years old. I wasn’t hoping for a paycheck. I just wanted my friends to feel something from the videos I was showing them,” she said.\n\n“So I think it’s incredible that the money has come, but I chose Sirius because there is a lot of opportunity to go to different places and grow Call Her Daddy into something bigger,” she added.","summary":"Cooper first started the ‘Call Her Daddy’ podcast in 2018","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/alex-cooper-call-her-daddy-podcast-net-worth-b2767728.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/10/18/40/alex-cooper.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/m7FcP6zm-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-11 04:41:27","author":"Amber Raiken","authors":["Amber Raiken"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.535},{"id":330166160,"title":"Paramount Global Layoffs: Media Company To Lay Off Its 3.5% of US Workforce Amid Decline in Cable TV Subscribers","text":"New Delhi, June 11: Paramount Global is said to be laying off its workforce in the United States as part of its latest round of job cuts. These layoffs reportedly come as the company faces a drop in its cable TV subscribers. In recent weeks, many companies in the media sector have also been reducing their staff. Paramount is not the only media firm making these job cuts. Disney recently laid off several employees from its television, film, and corporate finance departments. Similarly, Warner Bros. Discovery has also reduced its staff in its cable television division. This trend reflects the challenges that media companies are experiencing in adapting to changing viewer habits. Procter & Gamble Layoffs: FMCG Major To Reduce 7,000 Jobs, 15% of Its Non-Manufacturing Positions Globally Over Next 2 Years. As per a report of CNBC, citiing a memo, Paramount Global is planning to reduce its workforce in the US by 3.5%. The company has informed its employees about the upcoming layoffs. As of December, before the recent job cuts, Paramount had approximately 18,600 employees worldwide, including full-time and part-time staff. The memo was issued by the CEO's office, including George Cheeks, Chris McCarthy, and Brian Robbins. Additionally, the memo reportedly mentioned that this process might lead to job cuts for employees outside the US as well. In the memo, the CEOs expressed their understanding of how challenging this situation is for employees and conveyed their gratitude for everyone's hard work and contributions. The CEOs said, \"These changes are necessary to address the environment we are operating in and best position Paramount for success.\" Amazon Layoffs Continue: US-Based E-Commerce Giant Cuts More Jobs From Kindle and Alexa Units, Continues CEO Andy Jassy’s Strategy To Streamline Operations. The Paramount layoffs reportedly coincide with its effort to secure regulatory approval for a merger with Skydance Media, which is delayed due to a legal dispute between CBS and the Donald Trump administration over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. Last June, the CEOs outlined a plan for the future that included job cuts and a reduction in spending. Following this, in August, Paramount started to implement it and laid off its workforce based in the US by 15%.","summary":"Paramount Global is reportedly laying off 3.5% of its US workforce due to declining cable TV subscribers.

Gavin Newsom, who irked him by criticizing his militarized response to Los Angeles protests against his administration's immigration raids. Just four days earlier, Trump had suggested that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk, his former ally, could lose his government contracts for going public with concerns about the president's fiscal recklessness.\n\nIt's not clear whether Trump was serious in either case, whether he intends to follow through on his threats, or exactly how that would work. But the authoritarian intolerance of dissent reflected in those comments is consistent with the various ways Trump already has used the powers of his office to punish people whose views offend him.\n\nOver the weekend, Trump deployed 2,000 members of California's National Guard to protect federal personnel and property, invoking a law that authorizes such action when \"there is a rebellion or danger of a rebellion\" against the U.S. government's authority. That unilateral step, Newsom argued, was unnecessary, provocative, and illegal because local and state law enforcement agencies were willing and able to maintain order without federal intervention.\n\nThis was the context in which a reporter asked Trump whether Newsom should be arrested, noting that border czar Tom Homan had threatened that consequence for \"anybody,\" including Newsom, who interferes with the immigration crackdown. \"I would do it if I were Tom,\" Trump replied. \"Gavin likes the publicity, but I think it would be a great thing.\"\n\nMaybe Trump was joking. Maybe he also was joking when he argued, during the public flap that Musk provoked by slamming a Trump-backed bill as a \"disgusting abomination\" that would add trillions to the national debt, that \"the easiest way to save money in our Budget\" would be to \"terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.\"\n\nThen again, maybe not. No such excuse is available for Trump's plainly serious crusades against foreign students, lawyers, universities, and new outlets he portrays as enemies of democracy and American values.\n\nBy deporting students who criticize the Israeli government, Trump says, he is fighting antisemitism and protecting U.S. foreign policy interests. The goal, he explains, is to make students think twice before they open their mouths.\n\n\"Any student that protests,\" Trump said during his 2024 campaign, \"I throw them out of the country. You know, there are a lot of foreign students. As soon as they hear that, they're going to behave.\"\n\nTo justify his executive orders against disfavored law firms—which aimed to ruin them by revoking their security clearances, restricting their access to federal officials and buildings, canceling their government contracts, and threatening other contractors with ties to them—Trump likewise cited their support for causes and clients he abhors. Federal judges therefore had no difficulty concluding that the orders violated the First Amendment.\n\nTrump's conflict with Harvard, framed as an attempt to enforce federal civil rights laws, extends far beyond that goal. The administration has said the university cannot regain access to federal research grants unless it surrenders academic freedom by implementing a litany of hiring, admission, administrative, curricular, and disciplinary reforms.\n\nTrump is still pursuing his legal vendetta against CBS News, which he absurdly claims committed consumer fraud by editing a pre-election 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris in a way that made her seem slightly more cogent. In February, he upped the ante by raising his already risible estimate of the damages inflicted by that interview from $10 billion to $20 billion.\n\nTrump's beef with CBS is not limited to his abuse of the legal process as a private litigant. Brendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, reopened an equally groundless investigation of the network for \"broadcast news distortion\" based on the same interview—a probe that entails second-guessing journalistic judgments protected by freedom of the press.\n\nGiven this track record, it may not be safe to assume that Trump is only kidding when he threatens government retaliation for constitutionally protected speech.\n\n© Copyright 2025 by Creators Syndicate Inc.","summary":"Even if the president was joking in both cases, he already has used his powers to punish people whose views offend him.","url":"https://reason.com/2025/06/11/trumps-threats-against-musk-and-newsom-reflect-an-authoritarian-intolerance-of-dissent/","image":"https://d2eehagpk5cl65.cloudfront.net/img/q60/uploads/2025/06/Donald-Trump-2-14-25-Newscom-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 04:01:50","author":"Jacob Sullum,John Stossel","authors":["Jacob Sullum","John Stossel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.037},{"id":330152162,"title":"Ciattarelli and Sherrill Face Off in NJ Governor's Race: What Polls Say","text":"New Jersey voters hit the polls on Tuesday and cast their ballots in the state's primary races ahead of this year's gubernatorial election.Jack Ciattarelli, a former New Jersey state representative and one-time critic turned supporter of President Donald Trump, won the Republican Party's nomination for governor. On the Democratic side, U.S. Representative Mikie Sherrill snagged the party's nomination.With primaries in the rearview mirror, New Jersey's gubernatorial race kicks into high gear, with Sherrill pulling out all the stops to keep the governor's seat in Democrats' hands and Ciattarelli leveraging Trump's backing to flip it red.Newsweek reached out to Ciattarelli and Sherrill's campaigns for comment via LinkedIn and email, respectively, on Tuesday.Why It MattersNew Jersey is among only two states holding gubernatorial elections this year, alongside Virginia, meaning November's election in the Garden State will be one of the first and earliest tests of Trump's agenda.With New Jersey's incumbent Democratic governor, Phil Murphy, being term-limited, both parties see the contest as a crucial bellwether, especially after a competitive 2021 governor's election in which Ciattarelli lost to Murphy by a narrow margin.What To KnowAccording to the Associated Press, Ciattarelli clinched the GOP nomination for governor at 8:17 p.m. ET Tuesday and Sherrill was projected to win the Democratic nomination at 8:39 p.m.New Jersey has voted for a Democrat in every presidential election since 1988. Although Trump lost the state in November, he significantly narrowed the gap between the two parties, losing to then-Vice President and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by less than 6 percentage points.As Newsweek reported this month, it was the best showing by a GOP presidential nominee in two decades. By comparison, Joe Biden won New Jersey by 16 percentage points in the 2020 election.Ciattarelli, who won Trump's endorsement in May, also got some good news in a recent poll published shortly before Tuesday's primaries. According to SurveyUSA, Ciattarelli and Sherrill are viewed favorably by a near-equal percentage of New Jersey voters.The SurveyUSA poll found that 40 percent of Garden State voters have a favorable view of Ciattarelli, while 41 percent view Sherrill favorably. But there's a larger gap between the two candidates when it comes to their unfavorables, with 29 percent of voters having an unfavorable view of Sherrill, compared to 36 percent who have an unfavorable opinion of Ciattarelli.What People Are SayingThe Democratic National Committee, in an emailed statement to Newsweek from Chair Ken Martin: \"Congratulations to New Jersey Democratic gubernatorial nominee Rep. Mikie Sherrill and to New Jersey Democrats up and down the ballot who are stepping up to fight for families across the Garden State.\"The DNC is all hands on deck to ensure the Governor's office and Assembly remain blue in November. We will do everything in our power to unite the party and defeat Republican extremists like Jack Ciattarelli who want to rubber stamp Donald Trump's cost-hiking agenda and sell out working-class Americans. In 2025, Democrats have overwhelmingly won and overperformed in special and off-year elections.Concluding, Martin said, \"We'll continue that trend in New Jersey by organizing in every corner of the state, investing strategically, and working with our allies on the ground to elect more Democrats who will stand up to the Trump disaster and deliver for working families.\"Sherrill's campaign said in a statement, in part: \"Let's be clear about the two visions in this race: I am ready to stand up to an extreme Washington that doesn't have New Jersey's best interests at heart. Jack has already surrendered to them. It's our duty to meet the moment and live up to our state's motto of liberty and prosperity, because a Trump yes man like Jack Ciattarelli in Trenton will threaten it all.\"She added: \"While Jack is for Trump, I am for New Jersey. A New Jersey where housing is affordable so our kids can afford to live here, middle-class families can buy a home, and our seniors can afford to stay. A New Jersey where we finally take control of our energy future, and slash the cost of utilities. A New Jersey where a woman's right to an abortion is non-negotiable, and we respect the rule of law, due process, and the Constitution.\"Trump wrote on Truth Social over the weekend: \"The Great State of New Jersey has a very important Primary coming up on Tuesday. Get Out and Vote for Jack Ciattarelli, who has my Complete and Total Endorsement! His Opponents are going around saying they have my Endorsement, which is not true, I don't even know who they are! We can't play games when it comes to Elections, and New Jersey is a very important State that we must WIN. The whole World is watching. Vote for Jack Ciattarelli to, MAKE NEW JERSEY GREAT AGAIN!\"What Happens NextThe general election in New Jersey's governor's race is on November 4. In addition to Sherrill and Ciattarelli, five third-party or independent candidates are also running for the seat.","summary":"New Jersey's gubernatorial race now kicks into high gear, with Democrats pulling out all the stops to keep the seat blue while the GOP goes for the flip.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ciattarelli-sherrill-face-off-nj-governors-race-what-polls-say-2083730","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2660683/jack-ciattarelli-holds-election-night-rally.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 03:01:17","author":"Anna Commander,Sonam Sheth","authors":["Anna Commander","Sonam Sheth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":330174012,"title":"Rep.

Before that, she was the nation’s first openly trans state senator when she served in the Delaware General Assembly. Her congressional election brought not only a national spotlight, but also anti-trans attacks from GOP lawmakers once she took office. There were also critiques from some trans people who wanted McBride to fight harder on their behalf as Republicans mount a full-scale assault on trans rights.\n\nState of Firsts portrays McBride grappling with both the highs and the lows of what it meant to step into her role. It resists an easy narrative about life as a “first” being an upward trajectory of progress and celebration. For McBride, it has also been heavy with impossible expectations, conflicting allegiances, and flattening portrayals. As McBride sums up early on in the film: “It is an unbelievable challenge to figure out how I am seen as a full human being rather than just as a walking trans flag.”\n\nPart of that challenge came from her GOP colleagues. In one scene, McBride watches Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) attack her with insults on Steve Bannon’s podcast. “She’s just going to act like that every day,” McBride says to a campaign staffer as they watch the clip while sitting on a couch, “and my job will be to not respond.”\n\nThat self-imposed challenge was put to the test just weeks after her election, when Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) introduced a resolution seeking to bar McBride from using the women’s restroom. That move led to a swarm of media coverage. Democrats and LGBTQ advocates rushed to McBride’s defense. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) eventually announced that he would back a bathroom ban in the Capitol and implied that McBride would have to use the private bathroom in her office or one of the building’s unisex bathrooms. Greene even reportedly threatened to fight a transgender woman if she tried to use a women’s bathroom in the House part of the Capitol.\n\nMcBride refused to take the bait. She issued a statement that did not mention Mace by name but called the chaos sowed by the bathroom ban an effort to distract from the real issues plaguing the majority of Americans. “We should be focused on bringing down the cost of housing, health care, and child care, not manufacturing culture wars.” After Johnson announced he would move to enforce the bathroom ban (on Transgender Day of Remembrance, no less), McBride put out another, lengthier statement saying she would follow the rules “even if I disagree with them.” But for some trans advocates who wanted McBride to fight back, her response came as a “betrayal.”\n\nThe documentary features McBride’s most extensive and personal commentary on the debacle to date. \n\n“The disobedience isn’t taking a toilet seat; the disobedience is taking this congressional seat,” McBride says in a scene while driving her car after an orientation in DC for freshman lawmakers. “It’s not just that they don’t want me in bathrooms; they don’t want me in Congress.”\n\n“A win for them is me fighting back and then turning me into a caricature,” she continues. “There would be a bounty on my head if I said I refused to comply. I refuse to be martyred. I want to be a member of Congress.” And in what is perhaps her most blunt assessment of the risks she faces, McBride says: “It’s hard to play the long game when your short-term life is at risk.” \n\nMcBride manages to display an unwavering faith that she will be able to shift the culture in Congress, even if her strategy for doing so is not the one some advocates wanted. “The power of proximity, the power of our presence—it doesn’t change everything, but it has an impact,” McBride says in the car scene. “There are people who think representation doesn’t matter at all and there are people who think it will solve everything, and it’s somewhere in the middle.”\n\nThe film also shows the ways McBride’s family, Democratic allies, and an ongoing supply of Wawa coffee supported her during the campaign and her early days in office. In a sit-down with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), the pioneering lawmakers discuss the harder parts of making history. “What people don’t see and what they don’t really experience is that being the first means being the only,” Ocasio-Cortez tells McBride. “What they go after is your essential dignity as a human being. And, to be frank, that’s what really pisses me off about this,” she adds, referring to the bathroom ban.\n\n“I want to respect your autonomy and I want to respect your story and how you want to handle this for yourself, but I also want to clock these motherfuckers,” Ocasio-Cortez adds.\n\nMcBride’s strategy, though, seems to have paid off: Mace and Greene have since directed their attention elsewhere, and McBride has managed to work with colleagues across the aisle to introduce and co-sponsor several pieces of bipartisan legislation.\n\n“You have to remove the incentives for these people, because at the end of the day the incentive is attention,” McBride said at a panel discussion after the New York City premiere. “They’re employing the strategies of reality TV.”\n\nMcBride, on the other hand, describes herself as “fairly disciplined” in how she conducts herself in office. But she makes room for humor: After the credits roll, there’s a short video of McBride giving a tour of her office in Congress—including the bathroom. \n\n“It’s amazing,” she says, when she steps inside, “that I didn’t just burst into flames.”\n\nState of Firsts will next show at the DC/DOX film festival in Washington, DC on June 15.","summary":"My red carpet interview with Rep.

(AP) — New Jersey primary voters chose their nominees — and President Donald Trump notched a win in his endorsement belt — in one of two high-stakes governor's races being held this year.\n\nWhile officials from both parties say November's general election will hinge on local, pocketbook issues, the outcome will also be closely watched as a harbinger of how both parties might fare in next year’s midterm elections, and as a test of both Democratic enthusiasm and how the GOP fares without Trump on the ballot.\n\nHere are five takeaways from Tuesday's primary results:\n\nTrump notches a decisive win\n\n2025's off-year elections have been rough for Republicans and Trump.\n\nThe president went all in on Wisconsin's state Supreme Court race this spring, backing conservative Brad Schimel, even as polls showed Schimel lagging his Democratic-backed rival. Schimel went on to lose by a whopping 10 points, even after billionaire Elon Musk and groups he backed poured $21 million into the race.\n\nThis time, Trump's chosen candidate, Republican front-runner Jack Ciattarelli, easily won the nomination.\n\n\"Jack Ciattarelli is a WINNER, and has my Complete and Total Endorsement – HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN,\" Trump wrote in a social media post announcing his endorsement last month. “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, ELECT JACK CIATTARELLI!”\n\nAfter losing in 2021 to term-limited Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy by the slimmest of margins, Ciattarelli is hoping his third try for the office will be the charm.\n\nThe endorsement was a blow, in particular, to Ciattarelli rival Bill Spadea, a conservative radio host who ran by vowing to enthusiastically back the president's agenda.\n\nCiattarelli, he complained in one ad, “did more than disagree with the president. He disrespected him. Me? I've been a supporter of President Trump since he came down the escalator.”\n\nHe said voters should feel free to flout Trump's advice: “I've disagreed with him in the past. It's ok for you to disagree with him now.\"\n\nTrump, who spends many summer weekends in the state at his Bedminister golf club, alluded to the name dropping during a tele-rally he held on Ciattarelli's behalf. “Other people are going around saying I endorsed them. That's not true,\" he said.\n\nAnother primary all about Trump\n\nCandidates on both sides of the aisle vowed to tackle pocketbook issues, from high property taxes to grocery prices, to housing and health care costs.\n\nBut Trump loomed large.\n\nOn the GOP side, most of the candidates professed their allegiances to the president.\n\nCiattarelli said in ads that he would work with Trump and end New Jersey's status as a sanctuary state “on Day One.” (Currently, the state's attorney general has directed local law enforcement not to assist federal agents in civil immigration matters.) He also pledged to direct his attorney general to end lawsuits filed against the Trump administration, including one challenging Trump's effort to end birthright citizenship.\n\nDemocrats featured him heavily, too.\n\nIn one ad, Democratic Rep. Mikie Sherrill — who won the Democratic primary Tuesday and will take on Ciattarelli in November — featured an armada of pickup trucks waving giant Trump flags and warned that, “Trump’s coming for New Jersey with Trump-endorsed Republican Jack Ciattarelli.\"\n\n“We’ve gotta stop them,” it said.\n\nIn another, she tells viewers, “I know the world feels like it is on fire right now,\" and vows to \"stand up to Trump and Musk with all I’ve got.”\n\nPast insults forgotten\n\nBack in 2015, Ciattarelli labeled then-candidate Trump a “charlatan” who was unfit for the office of the presidency and an embarrassment to the nation.\n\n“Instead of providing the kind of leadership that appeals to the better angels of our nature in calling us to meaningful and just action, Mr. Trump preys upon our worst instincts and fears,” he wrote.\n\nWhen Ciattarelli ran in 2021, he distanced himself from Trump, without the outward insults.\n\nTrump nonetheless complained about the treatment on Spadea’s radio show last year, saying Ciattarelli “made some very big mistakes” and would have won had he sought Trump's support.\n\nBut like Vice President JD Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and so many others, past insults gave way to alliance.\n\nTrump offered his enthusiastic backing in a tele-rally, and in his endorsement, said that, “after getting to know and understand MAGA,” Ciattarelli “has gone ALL IN, and is now 100% (PLUS!).”\n\nA changing state\n\nNovember’s presidential election offered warning signs for Democrats in the state. While Trump lost to Democrat Kamala Harris, he did so by only 6 points — a significantly smaller margin than in 2020, when President Joe Biden won by 16 points.\n\n“New Jersey’s ready to pop out of that blue horror show,” Trump said in the tele-rally held for Ciattarelli last week.\n\nTrump also made stunning gains in several longtime Democratic strongholds, including New Jersey’s heavily Latino Passaic County. He carried the city of Passaic and significantly increased his support in Paterson, which is majority Latino and also has a large Muslim community.\n\nIndeed, 43% of Latino voters in the state supported Trump, up from 28% in 2020, according to AP VoteCast.\n\nNovember's election will serve as a crucial test for Democrats and whether they can regain Latino support — both in the state and nationally.\n\nIn the primary, strategists, unions, organizers and candidates pivoted away from immigration and focused on pocketbook concerns in their appeals.\n\n“At the end of the day, if you’re worried about paying your bills and being safe at night, everything else is secondary,” Rep. Josh Gottheimer, one of the Democratic candidates, told the AP. “I think that is front and center in the Latino community.”\n\nOne exception was Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was arrested while trying to join an oversight tour of a 1,000-bed immigrant detention center. A trespass charge was later dropped, but he sued interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba over the dropped prosecution.\n\nIn one of his final campaign ads in Spanish, he used footage from the arrest to cast himself as a reluctant warrior, with text saying he is “El Único,” Spanish for “the only one,” who confronts Trump.\n\nDemocrats rally around a former Navy helicopter pilot\n\nSherrill emerged from a crowded field that included two members of Congress, Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steven Fulop, teacher’s union president and former Montclair Mayor Sean Spiller and former state Senate President Steve Sweeney.\n\nSherrill leaned heavily on her biography as a former Navy helicopter pilot, federal prosecutor and a mother of four, using images of herself in uniform in her ads. Her campaign logo features a mini helicopter.\n\nDemocrats hope November’s general election — along with a gubernatorial election in Virginia — will draw a swell of angry voters eager to show their disdain for Trump’s sweeping second-term agenda, foreshadowing Democratic gains in next year's midterms.\n\nThere were signs of strong Democratic enthusiasm in early voting numbers. As of the last day of early in-person voting Sunday, more than 330,000 Democratic ballots had been cast, well outpacing the number of votes cast prior to last year’s Democratic presidential primary.\n\nThat compares to just 130,000 ballots cast by Republicans during the same time — a number that also tops early votes cast in last year’s Republican presidential primary and reflects the broader trend of Democrats being far more likely to vote early than Republicans, who tend to turn out in far greater numbers on Election Day.","url":"https://www.yahoo.com/news/takeaways-jerseys-primaries-gop-nominees-004725229.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x_c7V3jSwjPERMAf.IDH8w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyNDI7aD04Mjg-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/83db7b0ace1f238cf2fdff59d987455d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-11 00:47:25","author":"Jill Colvin","authors":["Jill Colvin"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.156},{"id":330131068,"title":"Democrat Mikie Sherrill wins NJ gubernatorial primary, setting up showdown with Trump-backed GOP winner","text":"MORRISTOWN, N.J. — Rep. Mikie Sherrill won New Jersey's Democrat gubernatorial primary on Tuesday night. The Associated Press projects that Sherrill has won the primary, which tees up a competitive race against three-time gubernatorial candidate and former GOP state lawmaker Jack Ciattarelli to replace Democrat Gov. Phil Murphy, who is term-limited this year. Sherill swept a crowded field of Democrat candidates, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, New Jersey Education Association President Sean Spiller, former New Jersey Senate President Steve Sweeney and fellow U.S. Rep. Josh Gottheimer. Democrat and Republican candidates often mentioned President Donald Trump's name on the New Jersey campaign trail as Democrats positioned themselves as the most anti-Trump and Republicans vied to be the most pro-Trump candidate. It was Ciattarelli who landed the Trump endorsement as Democrats worked to contrast the president's vision with their own. TRUMP NOT ON BALLOT, BUT PRESIDENT FRONT AND CENTER IN NEW JERSEY'S PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR New Jersey is one of just two governor's races in 2025, along with Virginia. Both will be used by politicians and pundits to gauge how Americans are responding to Trump's second term ahead of the midterm elections next year. TRUMP FRONT-AND-CENTER IN REPUBLICAN PRIMARY FOR GOVERNOR AS EARLY VOTING KICKS OFF As they campaigned for the coveted nomination, Democrat candidates walked a fine line between building on Murphy's legacy and promising to change the status quo in Trenton. Like Murphy, Democrat candidates have rejected Trump's executive orders, his crackdown on illegal immigration and the Department of Government Efficiency spending cuts. Acting as the last line of defense to a sweeping Republican agenda, Democrat governors have often rejected Trump's executive actions during his second term. By suing the Trump administration to unlock federal funds or refusing to comply with ICE deportations, Democrat governors, including many rumored to harbor 2028 presidential ambitions, are often leading the party's resistance to Trump. Trump once again took center stage on Tuesday as Sherrill and Gottheimer were peppered with questions by the press about the protests and riots unfolding in Los Angeles. When asked how she would handle the ongoing situation in Los Angeles differently from Gov. Gavin Newsom, Sherrill touted her military and law enforcement background and told Fox News Digital she would stand up \"strongly in favor of keeping people here in the state safe,\" return safety to the streets and continue \"speaking out against a president who is trying to create violence in the country.\" Sherrill is a Navy veteran and served in the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey as an outreach and re-entry coordinator, which she described as prosecuting federal cases and advising law enforcement on investigations. \"Governor Newsom surged law enforcement in, and what Trump seems to be doing is trying to add fuel to the fire and really make the situation violent and bad,\" Sherrill told reporters after casting her ballot in Montclair on Tuesday morning. \"That's completely unacceptable.\" Gottheimer said it was \"outrageous\" for Trump to send the National Guard to California without Newsom's request. \"The fact that the president, for the first time since 1965, sent troops in from the National Guard without a request from the governor is outrageous. It's just more chaos that we're used to having in this administration. It's not how I would approach this,\" Gottheimer told Fox News Digital after voting in Tenafly. Democrat candidates threw their support behind Baraka last month after he was arrested for trespassing at an ICE facility in Newark. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) called it a \"beyond bizarre political stunt,\" but Baraka has maintained that he did nothing wrong. Last week, Baraka filed a lawsuit against Alina Habba, U.S. attorney for the District of New Jersey, and DHS Agent Ricky Patel \"for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and defamation.\" Trump outperformed in the Garden State in 2024, according to Fox News Voter Analysis. While former Vice President Kamala Harris won New Jersey in 2024 as expected, Trump saw a nearly five-point improvement from his 2020 vote share, and Harris' support dropped by about five points. He gained across New Jersey, with his largest swings in the northeast corner of the state; Hudson and Passaic counties led the pack.

Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed into law an expansion of New Hampshire’s school voucher program, removing the income eligibility restrictions that had defined the program during its first four years. \"Giving parents the freedom to choose the education setting that best fits their child’s needs will help every student in our state reach their full potential,\" Ayotte said. \"I’m proud to sign this into law today along with the Parental Bill of Rights, which ensures parents are the central voice in their children’s education.

The program provides families of children with additional needs of up to a maximum of $9,676 per year in taxpayer funds. Prior to the bill being signed by Ayotte, less than half of students in the northeastern state were eligible for the school voucher program. Corey DeAngelis, a senior fellow at the American Culture Project, told Fox News Digital that \"the teachers unions really stepped in it by fighting to keep schools closed during the COVID era.\" TRUMP ADMIN TO PROBE ILLINOIS SCHOOL OVER ALLEGATIONS GIRLS WERE FORCED TO CHANGE IN FRONT OF TRANS STUDENT \"New Hampshire is the 17th state to pass universal school choice in the past four years. The wind is at our backs and the momentum for education freedom is unstoppable. We have a state that went for Kamala Harris in November now going all-in on school choice. Putting parents in the driver's seat should be a nonpartisan issue – kids don't belong to the government – but the Democrat Party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the teachers unions,\" DeAngelis said. New Hampshire is the latest state to pass universal school choice, joining a trend of states with Republican trifectas expanding education options for children. New Hampshire is the first state that passed the legislation that went for Democrat Kamala Harris in 2024. Arizona became the first state to offer universal school choice for all families in 2022, launching an $800 million program that gives parents $7,000 to put toward their children's tuition.

Jean Carroll. \n\nA New York court had found Trump guilty of sexual assault — not rape, a key legal difference — in the civil case. \n\nTrump has denied wrongdoing in that case.\n\n“All they should’ve said was, ‘George misspoke. The president, that paragon of virtue, was only found guilty of sexual assault, not rape. So we stand corrected,’” Costas said of the decision to settle. “They didn’t have to pay a $15 million ransom.”\n\nThe Post had previously reported that Stephanopoulos had been told repeatedly by producers to not use the word “rape” but he ignored the warnings.\n\nCostas then turned to CBS parent Paramount Global, which is controlled by Shari Redstone, over its attempts to settle another Trump suit over the alleged biased editing of a “60 Minutes” sit-down with then-vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nParamount is currently looking to close an $8 billion merger with Skydance Media in a move that would require the greenlight from Trump’s Federal Communications Commission. \n\nThe network has denied it deceptively edited the “60 Minutes” interview to make Harris sound more cogent.\n\nUnder pressure from Trump’s lawsuit and higher-ups at Paramount, longtime “60 Minutes” boss Bill Owens exited the company, citing waning editorial dependence. \n\n“And did Shari Redstone, because she wants to affect a merger that Trump’s FCC can stand in the way of, did she have to besmirch and undercut the gold standard in our lifetime of broadcast journalism, ’60 Minutes?'” Costas said. \n\n“Paying $20 million in ransom to Trump is just the cost of doing business when there’s billions of dollars at stake. These are ongoing assaults on the basic idea of a free press.”\n\nCostas also took a jab at CNN, which he claimed has “valorized” Trump “in the name of being balanced,” dubbing such work as “MAGA media.” CNN brass has pushed for anchors to try to remain objective when covering the Trump administration.\n\n“But if the answer to that is MAGA media, if the answer to that is Donald Trump’s view of the world, which is only through a prism of what benefits him, there are no higher ideals. There are no principles at work other than what benefits him,” he said. “I’ll stay with where we are without correction if the correction is what Donald Trump represents.”\n\n“If someone says – and the idea that you have to find somebody who will not just defend Donald Trump, but valorize it, even on CNN or wherever else, just in the name of being balanced– look, if someone is contending that the Earth is flat, in order to appear objective, you are not required to say, ‘Well, maybe it might be oblong.’ No, it’s not,” Costas said. “Certainly things are just true.”\n\nHe concluded: “And regrettably, something that’s true in America right now is that the President of the United States has absolutely no regard, and in fact has contempt, for basic American principles and basic common decency.”\n\nMediaite first reported on Costas’ comments.","summary":"The legendary broadcaster singled out ABC News and CBS News for rolling over after Trump sued both networks.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/10/media/bob-costas-rips-mainstream-media-for-doing-maga-media-there-really-isnt-two-sides/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/106259537.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 23:19:48","author":"Alexandra Steigrad","authors":["Alexandra Steigrad"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.484},{"id":330112334,"title":"Fetterman emerges as Dems’ ‘voice of reason’ as LA burns, conservatives say","text":"Pennsylvania Democratic Sen.

Alex Cooper Was Viciously Bullied as a ChildIn Part One, Cooper shares an old photo of her from when she was a child, making note of her braces, freckles, natural red hair, and skinny legs.Cooper would go on to explain how boys would viciously bully her, comparing her to a skeleton and make all the usual comments that go with being a ginger (no soul, etc.).This led to significant self-hatred for Cooper, especially when she was at sleepovers with her friends who didn't have these problems.2. \"The Unwell Tour\" Almost Didn't HappenIn Part One, production manager Jon Dindas appeared as if he was going to walk out on the \"Unwell Tour\" the day before the first performance in Boston.While there were no exact details revealed regarding what happened, it was stated that he was \"burnt out.\" When Cooper stated that no one knew how to do anything but him, Dindas laughed and said, \"That's part of the problem.\"More Entertainment: Everything We Know About Netflix's Season 4 of 'Ginny & Georgia'After noting that the show cannot go on without Dindas, Cooper addressed the entire crew to make sure that all of them feel appreciated.In the end, Dindas stayed with the tour and opening night went off without a hitch.3. Alex Cooper Accuses College Soccer Coach of Sexual HarassmentThe most shocking reveal came at the end of Part One, where Cooper accused her former Boston University soccer coach, Nancy Feldman, of sexually harassing her.\"My sophomore year everything really shifted. I started to notice her really starting to fixate on me way more than any other teammate of mine. And it was confusing because the focus wasn't on 'You're doing so well, let's get you on the field, you're going to be a starter.'\"It was all based in her wanting to know who I was dating, her making comments about my body, and her always wanting to be alone with me.\"Cooper then revealed that she would have private meetings with Feldman where she would stare at her, sit next to her on the couch, and put her hand on Cooper's thigh.Cooper then revealed that her coach's questions eventually became about her sex life, and if she didn't speak about them, \"there would be consequences.\"\"It was this psychotic game of 'You want to play, tell me about your sex life,'\" Cooper said. \"'I have to drive you to your night class. Get in the car with me, alone.'\"Cooper later shared more details about her experience on the \"Call Her Daddy\" YouTube account, as well as how much revisiting her college campus had an effect on her.4. Alex Cooper Still Feels Small Returning to Her CollegeThe alleged harassment from Cooper's coach had a drastic effect on her, something that the podcasting giant still feels to this day.Toward the end of Part One, Cooper revisited the Boston University campus. However, she didn't expect the anger that welled inside her.More Entertainment: 'Wicked: For Good' is Coming in November: Watch the Official Trailer\"The minute I stepped back on that field, I felt so small,\" Cooper later said during a Q&A, per Marie Claire. \"I just felt like I was 18 years old again and I was in a situation with someone in a position of power who abused that power.\"I felt like I wasn't the 'Call Her Daddy' girl. I wasn't someone who had money and influence or whatever. I was just another woman who experienced harassment on a level that changed my life forever and took away the thing I loved the most.\"5. Cooper's Parents Supported Her, Although Her Family and Community Did NotWhile Cooper didn't really speak to her breakup with \"Call Her Daddy\" co-creator and former co-host Sofia Franklyn, she and her family went into detail about how the sexually explicit nature of the show – like the infamous \"Gluck Gluck 9000,\" – had an effect on her extended family and community.\"You know, if I can be a little bold about my daughter, our town, it was turning things upside down,\" Cooper's mother said. \"People were talking about it, like, 'How could she do this? She's a good kid. She was raised well.'\"\"Even at some of these tour shows, they look at me and they're like, 'Are you ok with this?'\" Cooper's father shared. \"They give me that look and I'm like, 'Yeah.'\"\"We're talking sex, we're talking relationships. Everyone's having fun. And by the way, if you listen to the screaming... I think it's pretty successful.\"More Entertainment: 'Outer Banks' Star Cast as Snoop Dogg in Official Biopic'A Minecraft Movie' Hits HBO Max for Free Streaming in June: What to KnowFor more streaming and entertainment news, head on over to Newsweek Entertainment.","summary":"Here are the five biggest bombshells dropped from Alex Cooper's \"Call Her Alex\" docuseries on Hulu.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/entertainment/streaming/call-her-alex-cooper-docuseries-hulu-bombshells-2083702","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2660526/alex-cooper-date-night-daddy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 22:00:01","author":"Jeremy Hanna","authors":["Jeremy Hanna"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":330200738,"title":"Terry Moran fired from ABC News over social media posts on Trump and Stephen Miller","text":"Veteran ABC News correspondent Terry Moran is leaving the network, following his suspension over social media posts that were harshly critical of the Trump White House. Moran, 65, was suspended Sunday after statements on X that described President Trump and Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller as \"world class\" haters. He also called Miller \"vile.\" Moran, a senior national correspondent for the news division who interviewed Trump in the Oval Office in April, is not a commentator. An ABC News representative said his actions violated editorial standards and his contract was not renewed. He had been with the network since 1997. “We are at the end of our agreement with Terry Moran and based on his recent post — which was a clear violation of ABC News policies — we have made the decision to not renew,\" the representative said in a statement. \"At ABC News, we hold all of our reporters to the highest standards of objectivity, fairness and professionalism, and we remain committed to delivering straightforward, trusted journalism.” Moran's expulsion from the network is a sign that news organizations are concerned about journalists incurring the wrath of Trump, who has shown a willingness to fight back against his critics in the press. Moran is the first high profile journalist to lose his job over publicly lambasting the president and his aides. Moran wrote on a now deleted X post that “Miller is a man who is richly endowed with the capacity for hatred. He’s a world-class hater...You can see this just by looking at him because you can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment. He eats his hate.” Other outlets are getting pummeled by the White House as well, such as PBS and NPR. Trump wants their federal funding ended, calling their programming “left wing propaganda.” Trump is suing CBS News over a “60 Minutes” interview in October that he claims was deceptively edited to help his 2024 election opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris. The suit — an obstacle to CBS parent Paramount Global’s deal to merge with Skydance Media — has gone to a mediator. ABC News paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit Trump filed over statements by “Good Morning America” co-host George Stephanopoulos, who incorrectly said on air that the president had been liable of rape, when it was sexual abuse. Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Bob Iger has asked that ABC’s “The View” spend less time talking about Trump, who typically leads the daytime talk show’s hot topics segment. Former CNN anchor Jim Acosta — who battled Trump in the White House briefing room during the president's first term — left the network rather than take a midnight time slot that would have lowered his profile considerably. Acosta has since launched his own program on Substack.","summary":"Moran called Miller \"vile\" and described him and Trump as \"world class\" haters.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2025-06-10/terry-moran-fired-from-abc-news-over-social-media-posts-on-trump-and-stephen-miller","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6983ed2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1100x578+0+78/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F61%2Fc4%2Ff5acb6314b6f8fcb1d764b5094ef%2Fmoran.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-10 21:45:01","author":"Stephen Battaglio","authors":["Stephen Battaglio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":330105500,"title":"Bob Costas Condemns ABC, Shari Redstone for Not Standing Up to Trump Attacks on Free Press | Video","text":"Bob Costas blasted President Trump’s lawsuits against media companies — and the executives who are buckling under them rather than fighting back. “The free press is under attack.

Tim Walz is set to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Thursday, and he’s sure to be grilled on “sanctuary city” policies in the Land of 10,000 Lakes. \n\nThe Daily Signal spoke with Walz’s fellow Minnesotan, House Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who spared few words in criticizing a governor he views as a “jet puff,” a “liar,” and a “challenged human being.”\n\nWalz, who was the Democrats’ vice presidential candidate last year on the presidential ticket of former Vice President Kamala Harris, will testify alongside Democrat Govs. JB Pritzker of Illinois and Kathy Hochul of New York.\n\nEmmer says that Walz’s administration has heavily discouraged detaining illegal immigrants.\n\nWalz “and his henchman, the attorney general, have literally threatened every law enforcement agency in the state, that if they try to do their jobs when they pick up an illegal alien—these criminals, the murderers, the terrorists, which we have in Minneapolis—that if you detain them, you’re going to get sued,” said Emmer. \n\nMinnesota state Attorney General Keith Ellison issued an opinion in February stating that holding people in custody on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainers is “unconstitutional.”\n\n“Minnesota law prohibits state and local law enforcement agencies from holding someonebased on an immigration detainer if the person would otherwise be released from custody,” Ellison’s opinion states.\n\nEmmer says that that policy has placed a heavy burden on local law enforcement.\n\n“They’ve really made it difficult for these guys to keep their communities safe and keep these bad guys out. Because Tim Walz actually thinks … he represents the murderers, rapists, terrorists, the illegals, at the expense of the citizens who are paying his salary.”\n\nWalz will be in difficult position on Thursday. On the one hand, he likely will want to project toughness, as he has recently called on Democrats to “bully the s–t out of” President Donald Trump. \n\nOn the other hand, he must be careful not to pick a fight that would lead to Minnesota losing federal funding—something the White House has threatened against sanctuary states.\n\nEmmer scoffed at Walz’s talk of bullying Republicans.\n\n“Now he’s saying he wants to be bullying people, he says he’s the whisperer to white men. This guy is challenged to say the least,” the Minnesota Republican congressman said.\n\n “He is a challenged human being who has just completely gone off the rails … and, clearly, he continues to show us through the sanctuary state policy that he’s concerned more about illegals … than he is about Minnesota citizens.”\n\nEmmer expects Walz to do his best to deflect throughout the hearing.\n\n“I think he’s going to do the same thing he always does. He always tries to deflect. He tries to talk about hate and racism and ‘everyone’s welcome here.’ There is absolutely no substance to this jet puff,” said Emmer. Jet-Puffed is a brand of marshmallows. \n\n“He is all sweetness on the outside and nothing on the inside, so I expect him to try to do that again. But hopefully, members of the committee will try to hold him to account for what he has caused and what he has done.”\n\nThe committee’s discussion of the sanctuary state issue likely will be further electrified by Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to help control the rioting there against immigration-enforcement raids.\n\nEmmer thinks that’s a winning issue for Republicans.\n\n“I think Tim Walz and the guy from Illinois and the ‘excuse’ from New York are probably going to come in and try to suggest that Trump caused that. It’s not going to play with the American people. The American people are smarter than that. They showed you that last November,” he said.\n\nEmmer clearly has a low opinion of his fellow Minnesotan. \n\nAsked whether he thought Walz might try to project an image of caring about border security as the Harris campaign did in 2024, Emmer spoke about what he views as a history of dishonesty from Walz.\n\n“He’s pathological with his lying. You saw it on full display on national TV when he lied about something as dumb as when he was at Tiananmen Square,” said Emmer, referring to Walz’s past erroneous claims to have been in Hong Kong at the time of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.\n\n“His excuse was when he was caught in a bald-faced lie on national TV, ‘Well, I grew up in a small town and I’m a bit of a knucklehead.’ Hey, Tim, you’re a liar. That is not just not being truthful … . So, when Kamala was saying that [she cared about border security], and when he was saying it, they didn’t mean it … . This is why Donald Trump was elected.”\n\nRepresentatives for Walz could not immediately be reached for comment.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.
