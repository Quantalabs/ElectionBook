He was the subject of several sexting scandals before she separated from him in 2016.\n\nUnlike the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, the Soros-Abedin weekend did feature a gesture of unity between two religions that have historically been the source of wars and cultural conflict with a smaller ceremony on Friday to honor both Ms. Abedin’s Muslim faith and Mr. Soros’s Jewish heritage. A rabbi and an imam both officiated, according to people who were there, the Times reported.","summary":"Married were Alex Soros, son of George Soros, the Democrat party’s dependable donor and the bane of conservatives, and Huma Abedin, longtime political aid to Hillary Clinton and ex-wife of disgraced former congressmen Anthony Weiner.\n\n\nThe post Alex Soros and Huma Abedin&#8217;s Hampton Wedding Features Democrat Elites and Donors appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/06/15/alex-soros-and-huma-abedins-hampton-wedding-features-democrat-elites-and-donors/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/GettyImages2213638978-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 21:31:37","author":"Lowell Cauffiel","authors":["Lowell Cauffiel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.375},{"id":331737032,"title":"Ivanka Trump praises her father’s ‘unwavering determination, boundless vision’","text":"“To my father @realdonaldtrump — your unwavering determination, boundless vision, and deep love for family have been a guiding force in my life,” Ivanka Trump posted on X. “You taught me to dream boldly, work relentlessly, and never give up.”\n\nDonald Trump Jr. and Tiffany Trump also shared social media messages celebrating their father, with the president’s oldest son posting a collection of photos with him and his “legend of a dad” together.

Alleged Minnesota assassin was appointed by Tim Walz, ‘voted for Trump’","text":"MINNEAPOLIS — The massive manhunt for alleged Minnesota political assassin Vance Luther Boelter — and revelations about his bizarre life and back story — have sparked major questions about his political affiliations and motives.\n\nCops believe that Vance Luther Boelter murdered a top Democratic state lawmaker and attempted to kill another Dem politician. But, he was also appointed to a state advisory board by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. \n\nBoelter claimed to have a doctorate of education, and said he spent extensive time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa — where he was seen in videos apparently preaching on stage.\n\nBoelter, 57, is being hunted by authorities in connection with the assassination of Democrat Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in their suburban Minneapolis home early on Saturday, in what Walz described as “targeted political violence.”\n\nThe suspected assassin, who reportedly had a list of 70 “targets” including that of Walz, is also accused of badly wounding a second Democrat lawmaker, Senator John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin, a northern suburb of Minneapolis, on Saturday.\n\nBoelter was reportedly impersonating law enforcement when he entered both lawmakers’ homes and when he later exchanged gunfire with police.\n\nHaunting security camera footage believed to show him wearing a creepy latex mask of an old man’s face was shared by the FBI on Saturday, which issued a $50,000 reward for information leading to his capture.\n\n‘Politically motivated assassination’\n\nGov. Walz described the killing of Hortman as “a politically motivated assassination.”\n\nHis roommate said that he had conservative political views, but rarely talked about politics and didn’t seem overtly political.\n\n“He was a Trump supporter. He voted for Trump. He liked Trump. I like Trump,” lifelong friend David Carlson told The Post. \n\n“He didn’t like abortion.”\n\nBoelter lived with Carlson and another man part-time while he worked a job in Minneapolis — while his wife and children lived on a farm in rural Green Isle, about 50 minutes from the big city. \n\nFollowing the shootings, he sent a sinister message to his friends.\n\n“I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way,” he said in the message, as reported by the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\nWhen cops searched Boelter’s car, they found a targeted list of individuals including several politicians as well as abortion providers and pro-abortion politicians, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nThose included Democratic Rep. Kelly Morrison and US Sen. Tina Smith, according to their respective offices.\n\nA picture of handwritten fliers with the slogan “No Kings,” which has become a popular anti-Trump rallying cry, were also reportedly found in his car, according to law enforcement.\n\nAppointed by Gov. Tim Walz\n\nTwo notices of appointment for Boelter to the Governor’s Workforce Development Board (GWDB) were obtained by KTTC.\n\nAlthough the exact motivations for Boelter’s alleged crimes are unclear, it is known that he served on the same state workforce development board as Sen. Hoffman, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said.\n\nThe first notice was issued by Gov. Walz’s predecessor, Mark Dayton, a fellow Democrat, in June 2016 for a two-year term.\n\nBoelter was listed as a private sector representative for Dayton’s appointment.\n\nHe was reappointed to the board by Gov. Walz in December 2019, this time as a business member, for a term that expired in January 2023.\n\nThe GWDB is listed under Minnesota’s Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED), which includes Sen. Hoffman under its current membership directory.\n\nWaltz sources told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that the governor, who was Kamala Harris’ presidential running-mate, didn’t know Boelter. \n\nBoelter was merely re-appointed to a bipartisan advisory board that had 60 members, his office told the newspaper.\n\nBoelter mysterious work history\n\nBoelter spent much of his career in the food industry, working at Nestle and Del Monte, as well as a spell at Wisconsin-based Johnsonville Sausage, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nHe is a St. Cloud State University graduate and later received his Master of Science and a doctor of education from Cardinal Stritch University, a private Catholic establishment in Milwaukee, which closed in May 2023 following financial challenges and declining enrollment.\n\nHe spent a decade as a general manager at a Greencore grocery store and at a 7-Eleven in Minneapolis before leaving in November 2021 to become CEO of a mysterious company called Red Lion Group.\n\nIt is not clear what the company did and the website for Red Lion Group, linked to Boelter’s LinkedIn profile, is currently down.\n\nBoelter also claimed he was the head of a security company in Minnesota, but also reportedly had links to central Africa.\n\nA month ago, Boelter claimed he was looking for work and wanted to get back into the food industry on his LinkedIn, while also describing his recent work in Africa with the mystery Red Lion Group.\n\n“I’m looking to get back into the US Food Industry and I’m pretty open to positions,” he wrote. “I have been doing projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa the last three years with Red Lion Group. If you hear of any opportunities or just want to catch up, please send me a message.”\n\nHe described himself as open to senior roles in Texas, Minnesota, Florida and the Washington DC-Baltimore area.\n\nTwo years ago, he claimed he was “currently in the Democratic Republic of Congo working on several projects, adding that “Red Lion Group had a great meeting with the new Governor of Congo Central to talk about our private business projects that are all moving forward.”\n\nBoelter is also listed as the director of security patrols on the website of the Praetorian Guard Security Services, which uses a photo of him also shared by the FBI.\n\nPraetorian Guard Security Services claimed to provide residential armed home security in Minnesota. However, his roommate Carlson said the company never had any clients or employees. \n\n“His dream was to have a security company. He never was or never had a security company. It’s like me saying I want to start a company selling hot dogs, but I need a hot dog stand,” he said. \n\n“I find a hot dog stand and I need supplies and it never kinda works out and I have the hot dog stand.”\n\nDespite that, he made big claims about his work.\n\n“Vance has been involved with security situations in Eastern Europe, Africa, North America and the Middle East, including the West Bank, Southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip,” his profile on the company website reads.\n\n“He brings a great security aspect forged by both many on the ground experiences combined with training by both private security firms and by people in the U.S. Military. He has worked for the largest U.S. oil refining company, the world’s largest food company based in Switzerland and the world’s largest convenience retailer based in Japan.”\n\nSearch continues\n\nPolice on Sunday are still surrounding Boelter’s home around five miles from the remote hamlet of Green Isle, which itself is an hour outside of Minneapolis.\n\nHis only public criminal history in Minnesota is for minor traffic tickets including speeding and parking violations, KTTC reports.\n\nThe manhunt for Boelter is continuing into Sunday with parts of suburban Minneapolis put under shelter-place-orders.\n\nResidents in South Dakota were warned to watch out for a maroon Buick potentially being driven by a “person of interest in the events that have happened in Minnesota,” who could be traveling with someone “armed and dangerous,” according to law enforcement.","summary":"Boelter claimed to have a doctorate of education, and said he spent extensive time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa — where he was seen in videos apparently preaching on stage.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/15/us-news/what-are-vance-luther-boelter-politics-alleged-minnesota-assassin-was-appointed-by-tim-walz-voted-for-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/vance-boelter-comp-106542401.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/USu8s2Iw-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-15 21:17:48","author":"Anthony Blair,Steven Vago","authors":["Anthony Blair","Steven Vago"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":331728190,"title":"Trump vetos Israeli plan to kill Iran’s supreme leader","text":"ISRAEL AND IRAN CONTINUE ATTACKS\n\nIsrael and Iran continued to launch attacks against each other on Sunday despite international calls to de-escalate their conflict, as reports claim US President Donald Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe New York Times says Israel bombarded the Iranian capital Tehran with a new wave of strikes on Sunday afternoon before Iran launched missiles and drones at Israel in response, with reports that explosions were heard over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, while the port city of Haifa was struck on Sunday evening. The BBC reports Israel has confirmed it is continuing to fire at targets within Iran throughout the night.\n\nThe NYT said Israel’s earlier daytime attack on Tehran came as both sides were still assessing the damage from assaults on Saturday evening. “Overnight, Israeli fighter jets bombarded Tehran, setting the sky ablaze with flames from burning fuel reservoirs from the country’s vital energy industry, while Iran launched volleys of ballistic missiles at Israel, some of which eluded the country’s air defences,” the NYT reports.\n\nThe BBC quotes Iranian media reports as saying 128 people have been killed in the country as of Saturday midday, while 10 people are reported to have been killed in Iran’s attacks on Saturday night. Iran’s health ministry says Israeli strikes have killed 224 people across the country since Friday.\n\nIn the last couple of hours, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given a live interview on Fox News, saying: “The issue here is not de-escalation. The issue here is not ceasefire. The issue is to stop those things that threaten our survival.”\n\nIsrael has claimed it launched “Operation Rising Lion”, which initially targeted Iran’s military command and nuclear sites, on Friday “to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival”. The Israeli PM said Iran has taken steps to “weaponise” in recent months and that, “if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time”, the BBC reports. The broadcaster adds Iran has denied that it has a nuclear weapons program.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News on Sunday, Netanyahu said he and Trump are “fully coordinated” as the latter took to his social media platform to try and claim there would be “peace soon” between Israel and Iran and called on both sides to “make a deal”. Writing on Truth Social, the 79-year-old claimed: “Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that’s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nIn the last couple of hours, Reuters has reported that Trump vetoed an alleged Israeli plan to kill Khamenei.\n\nA senior US administration official is quoted as saying: “Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do, we’re not even talking about going after the political leadership.” The Associated Press has also run the story and sourced the claims to a US official familiar with the matter.\n\nThe newswire states Israel “had informed the Trump administration in recent days that they had developed a credible plan to kill Khamenei. After being briefed on the plan, the White House made clear to Israeli officials that Trump was opposed to the Israelis making the move”.\n\nAP reports the Trump administration “is desperate to keep Israel’s military operation aimed at decapitating Iran’s nuclear program from exploding into an even more expansive conflict”.\n\nOn Sunday, the US president told America’s ABC News: “We’re not involved in it [Israel’s strikes on Iran]. It’s possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved.”\n\nThe New York Times adds that the head of the Iranian traffic police, residents and Iranian news media report the roads leading out of Tehran have been packed with heavy traffic “as people scramble to find a way to leave the capital”. The Guardian reports Netanyahu earlier on Sunday said Iran will pay a “heavy price” after Israeli civilians were killed in the overnight strikes.\n\nElsewhere, the newspaper also reports European leaders plan to spend the opening day of the G7 summit in Canada asking Trump to justify his aforementioned confidence in a peace deal between Israel and Iran.\n\nALBANESE IN CANADA FOR TRUMP TALKS\n\nSpeaking of the G7 summit, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will land in Canada on Sunday (local time) ahead of his much-discussed talks with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the gathering of world leaders.\n\nThe AAP highlights Albanese will get his meeting (depending on world events and Trump’s mood) in Kananaskis, Alberta, on Tuesday local time.\n\nHeading into the meeting with topics such as tariff exemptions, the future of AUKUS, and global unrest no doubt top of mind, the PM told business leaders in Seattle on Saturday: “The combination of Australia and the United States when we’re working together is an unbeatable combination.”\n\nThe Australian Financial Review reports Albanese will push back on demands from the US to ratchet up its defence budget when he meets with the president. The paper also quotes the PM as saying he was sure the Middle East would “be a topic of conversation” during the leaders’ meeting, but there was no expectation Australia would be asked to provide Israel with military support.\n\nBefore Albanese talks to Trump, he will hold bilateral talks with a series of other world leaders, including the host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. AAP states the pair are expected to discuss tariffs (most likely how to navigate Trump’s demands), defence, critical minerals, climate change and the situation in the Middle East.\n\nWhile in Seattle over the weekend, Albanese visited Amazon’s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services. On that theme, The Australian reports the prime minister “is facing internal dissent over Amazon’s access to lucrative public contracts … while three ministers are among at least 17 government MPs who have accused the company of exploiting its workers”.\n\nThe paper says the “internal disquiet” comes as Communication Minister Anika Wells prepares to sign off “one of the biggest federal government contracts with the company — a deal with the National Broadband Network to deliver satellite internet services to the bush”.\n\nThe broadsheet also reports on the fact the Reserve Bank of Australia will now reveal how its board members vote on interest rate decisions, although it won’t name them. The Nine papers have also picked up the story, saying the change is part of the reforms to the central bank about to be finalised by Treasurer Jim Chalmers and RBA governor Michele Bullock.\n\nThe papers point out the move will bring the RBA “largely in line with central banks around the world”, with those in favour of the change saying it will improve decision-making. The changes will see the vote decision made public in the case of a split decision by the board.\n\nThe Nine papers also point out that the financial markets are currently putting the chance of another rate cut at the next RBA board meeting in July at 97%. The AFR, meanwhile, says the Israeli strikes on Iranian energy infrastructure are causing concern “that a longer-term oil price spike will fuel inflation and derail hopes of interest rate cuts”.\n\nThe AAP reports this morning that tariffs and global conflict have knocked Australians’ optimism in the economy and trust in the US to 20-year lows.\n\n“Australians are clearly unsettled by what they’ve seen of the second Trump administration, with almost two-thirds (64%) now holding little to no trust in the United States to act responsibly — the lowest level in the history of the Lowy Institute Poll,” the institute’s executive director Michael Fullilove said.\n\nGuardian Australia over the weekend reported: “An Australian man who was detained upon arrival at Los Angeles airport and deported back to Melbourne says United States border officials told him it was due to his writing on pro-Palestine protests by university students.”\n\nON A LIGHTER NOTE…\n\nA museum in Italy has called on visitors to “respect art” after a chair covered in hundreds of crystals was broken.\n\nLast week, the Palazzo Maffei in Verona released footage of a couple taking pictures of each other pretending to sit on artwork by Italian artist Nicola Bolla, known as the “Van Gogh” chair, the BBC reports. The video, which has gone viral, shows the man slipping and falling on the chair.\n\nMuseum director Vanessa Carlon said of the incident: “Sometimes we lose our brains to take a picture, and we don’t think about the consequences.\n\n“Of course it was an accident, but these two people left without speaking to us — that isn’t an accident. This is a nightmare for any museum”.\n\nThe BBC reports the museum has notified the police, but the pair have yet to be identified.\n\nMike, I have to go. I am taking a call from Putin.Donald Trump\n\nThe US president spoke to The Atlantic’s Michael Scherer on Saturday (his 79th birthday) ahead of his heavily debated military parade. Trump attempted to counter the criticism levelled at him by the likes of Tucker Carlson, as well as trying to defend his promised ability to end conflicts around the world, as more rage every day.\n\nCRIKEY RECAP\n\nREAD ALL ABOUT IT\n\nAir India plane crash death toll rises to 270 (BBC)\n\nAuthorities still searching for suspect in shooting of two Minnesota state lawmakers (Associated Press)\n\nAt least eight killed near Gaza food sites as Palestinians fear global attention switching to Iran (The Guardian)\n\nAnti-tourism protests break out in Spain, Italy and Portugal (Sky News)\n\nThe Clintons and Kamala Harris descend on a Hamptons wedding of liberal royalty (The New York Times) ($)\n\nTHE COMMENTARIAT\n\nTrump loves playing toy soldiers, but it is not a game – The Herald’s View (The Sydney Morning Herald): Few seemed to notice the ironies: Trump glories in military might, yet was medically exempt from serving in Vietnam in 1968 after a foot doctor and friendly family business associate diagnosed heel spurs; he later attacked Republican rival John McCain, a navy flyer and POW at the Hanoi Hilton, saying, “He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.” The $69 million parade comes just months after Trump slashed funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nMeanwhile, as Trump bathed in birthday adulation, protests erupted across the US with the “No Kings” group adding a personal anti-authoritarian slap in the face to the president for defying court orders and questionable deportations.\n\nIsrael’s attacks on Iran are already hurting global oil prices, and the impact is set to worsen — Joaquin Vespignani (The Conversation): The weekend attacks on Iran’s oil facilities — widely seen as part of escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran — represent a dangerous moment for global energy security.\n\nWhile the physical damage to Iran’s production facilities is still being assessed, the broader strategic implications are already rippling through global oil markets.

The narrative being pushed is that President Trump is acting like a tyrannical ruler, which has led to the emergence of the “No Kings” movement.\n\nOn Friday, we encountered an intriguing situation as CBS News made a puzzling decision regarding these gatherings. The network is currently facing legal challenges from President Trump over its “60 Minutes” interview and is involved in internal disputes, with executives urging the news division to tone down its partisan expressions. Amidst all this, some creative minds at the network thought it prudent to guide viewers on where they could buy anti-Trump merchandise.\n\nThe actual protests were rather unimpressive affairs.

Mr Boelter also had fliers for anti-Trump “no kings” protests in his car.\n\nMs Hortman used her position as speaker in 2023 to champion expanded protections for abortion rights, including legislation to solidify Minnesota’s status as a refuge for patients from restrictive states who travel to the state to seek abortions – and to protect providers who serve them.\n\nAmy Klobuchar, a Democrat senator for Minnesota, said she believed abortion was a motivation for Mr Boelter.\n\n“It was politically motivated, and there clearly was some throughline with abortion because of the groups that were on the list, and other things that I’ve heard were in this manifesto.

I think he’s a terrible governor. I think he’s a grossly incompetent person. But I may, I may call him, I may call other people too,” he told ABC.\n\nMr Walz spoke with JD Vance, the vice-president, on Saturday. Mr Walz expressed thanks for the coordination between federal law enforcement and state public safety officials, according to CNN.\n\nThe attacks prompted warnings to other state elected officials and the cancellation of planned anti-Trump demonstrations over fears they could be targeted.\n\nSome protests went ahead anyway, including one that drew tens of thousands to the State Capitol.\n\nLaw enforcement agents recovered several AK-style firearms from the suspect’s vehicle, and he was believed to still be armed with a pistol, officials said.\n\nThe shootings happened at a time when political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions.\n\n“We must all, in Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence,” Mr Walz said.\n\n“Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!” Mr Trump said in a statement.\n\nPolice responded to reports of gunfire at the Mr Hoffman’s home shortly after 2 am, Champlin police said, and found the couple with multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nPolice sent officers to proactively check on Ms Hortman’s home. There they encountered what appeared to be a police vehicle and a man dressed as an officer at the door, leaving the house.\n\n“When officers confronted him, the individual immediately fired upon the officers who exchanged gunfire, and the suspect retreated back into the home” and escaped on foot, said Mark Bruley, the Brooklyn Park police chief.\n\nAuthorities believe the shooter was wearing a mask when carrying out the attacks, according to a law enforcement official.\n\nThe FBI released photos of the suspect including an image that appears to show him wearing a mask that covered his face and head, a police uniform, and holding a flashlight.\n\nMr Boelter is chief executive of Praetorian Guard Security Services, and has armed security experience across the Middle East, Africa, Eastern Europe and North America, according to a biography on its website.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/minnesota-gunman-motivated-hatred-abortion-195241147.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/O73f4vHxwtMWasspLIgS_g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03NTI-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_telegraph_818/9ea5f426b3b1c236448e45d23f886026","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 19:52:41","author":"Susie Coen","authors":["Susie Coen"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":331724912,"title":"Report -- 'Bad Vibes': Infighting Roils Democrat Party as Troubles Multiply","text":"The Democrat party is reportedly experiencing infighting as it faces a mountain of problems and lacks clear leadership.\n\nThere has apparently been much disagreement between members of the party, the Hill reported Sunday, especially after President Donald Trump won the White House for a second time in 2024.\n\nDemocrats have been grappling with controversies surrounding former President Joe Biden’s (D) cognitive decline as he was leading the nation, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) recently voting to remove gun-control activist David Hogg as its vice chair, and the upcoming primaries.\n\nWATCH — We’re Back!

Boelter fled on foot after exchanging gunfire with officers after the second shooting.On Sunday officers located another car related to Boelter in a rural area about a 90-minute drive west of Minneapolis, the Sibley County Sheriff's Office told AFP.Residents were warned of the find and agents are scouring the area, the office said without explaining how the vehicle is related to the suspect.Officials have issued security alerts in South Dakota and other states as the hunt proceeds, US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Sunday as she mourned her slain friend, Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman.\"I am concerned about all our political leaders, political organizations,\" she said.\"It was politically motivated, and there clearly was some throughline with abortion because of the groups that were on the list, and other things that I've heard were in this manifesto.

Altogether, at least 56 people were arrested in the L.A. area. In Downtown Los Angeles, near Westlake, the sight of blazes on several blocks — after riot police lobbed flashbang rounds at crowds, and protesters set off fireworks and torched cars — called to mind the wildfires that ravaged the region at the start of the year.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Sunday deployed the National Guard in this deeply blue city that opposes his mass deportations policy, a move that critics — including former Vice President Kamala Harris — argued intensified confrontations between protesters and the authorities. Commuters driving to work on Monday morning saw what remained of the clashes — self-driving Waymo cars burnt to crisps and graffiti tagged all over downtown businesses and buildings.\n\nSchools are still reeling from the raids and the unrest, with commencement ceremonies set to continue this week.\n\nOfficials acknowledge that many families in the district — which includes an estimated 30,000 immigrant students — plan to sit out commencement because of concerns about immigration enforcement. LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho described that decision as “a heartbreak” during a news conference Monday.\n\n“I’ve spoken with parents who’ve told me that their daughter will be the first in their family to graduate high school, and they’re not going to be there to witness it because they have a fear of the place of graduation being targeted,” Carvalho said. “What nation are we? Who in their right mind would accept that reality?”\n\nFears have been stoked by unfounded rumors such as the one that emerged on Friday that an immigration raid took place at Gratts’ graduation. “The claims that immigration enforcement activity arrived at the school and during the event are false,” an LAUSD spokesperson told The 19th.\n\nThe superintendent, an immigrant from Portugal who was formerly undocumented, said the district is taking steps to protect each graduation site, whether on or off campus. The school police will “establish perimeters of safety” around graduation locations and intervene if any federal agency tries to disrupt the ceremonies, Carvalho said.\n\n“We’ve instructed our principals to not create lines, to not restrict access,” he said. “As soon as [families] come, they will enter the venues where the graduations are taking place, reducing the risk for them while on the street waiting to get in. We also have authorized the principals to allow parents to remain at the venue for as long as it takes should there be any immigration enforcement action around the area where the graduations are taking place.”\n\nRelated | Trump is making life hell for immigrants in California—and everywhere else\n\nSchool police will also remain on site well after the ceremonies end to allow parents to exit safely. And, in limited capacities, the district will create opportunities for families to watch their children graduate via Zoom.\n\nCarvalho said that the recent raids and unrest happened at the worst possible time, given that over 100 graduation ceremonies will be taking place throughout LAUSD Monday and Tuesday, the last day of school. Still, he said the district is prepared to protect students, staff and families.\n\n“Every child has a constitutional right to a public education,” he said. “Therefore, every child and their parent has a right to celebrate the culmination of their educational success.”\n\nUnited Teachers Los Angeles (UTLA), the woman-led labor union representing Los Angeles Unified educators, has also spoken out against the immigration enforcement that took place in Los Angeles last week.\n\n“The ruthless targeting of hard-working people by ICE and law enforcement agencies is not only unjust but cruel,” the union said in a statement pinned to its Instagram page. “They are using violence and scare tactics to detain people who are simply trying to live and support their families. We will not stand for this.”\n\nOn Monday, United Teachers Los Angeles organized a rally to stand up for immigrant communities and to protest the arrest of union leader David Huerta, president of Service Employees International Union (SEIU) – United Service Workers West and SEIU California. Huerta was arrested Friday while observing an immigration raid at a Los Angeles garment factory. He has been charged with felony conspiracy to impede officers and could face up to six years in federal prison if convicted. \n\n“We need more people to continue to be loud about these attacks by ICE,” the Los Angeles teachers’ union said. “History has taught us that we cannot afford to stand idly by while our community members are being ripped away from their schools, homes, neighborhoods and workplaces.”\n\nRandi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation’s second-largest teachers union, also expressed her outrage over Huerta’s arrest, the detainment of immigrant workers and Trump’s decision to mobilize the National Guard against protesters.\n\n“It is no coincidence that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detained David Huerta and raided the site of a known worker center — and we, alongside the entire labor movement, are demanding his and others’ immediate release,” Weingarten said in a statement. “The assault on Los Angeles contradicts all this country stands for. We are a nation made stronger by immigrant workers, stronger by the unions that represent them, and stronger by the rule of law.” Huerta was released from custody Monday afternoon.\n\nKamala Harris criticized the violent repression of mostly peaceful protesters in Los Angeles, singling out Trump for his role in the unrest that ensued. Harris has lived in L.A.’s Brentwood neighborhood since marrying Doug Emhoff in 2014, though she was largely based in Washington, D.C., as vice president.\n\n“Los Angeles is my home, and like so many Americans, I am appalled at what we are witnessing on the streets of our city,” she said in a statement. “Deploying the National Guard is a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos. In addition to recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump administration’s cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division.”\n\nThe White House, meanwhile, took aim at the protesters, as well as California Gov. Gavin Newsom and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, both Democrats.\n\n“Radical left lunatics are taking to the streets of Los Angeles — attacking law enforcement, hurling projectiles at police cruisers, burning vehicles, and shutting down freeways — because the Trump administration is removing violent criminal illegal immigrants from their communities,” the White House said in a statement Monday. “Democrats like Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass should be thanking President Trump for stepping up and leading where they refused — and for ridding their streets of criminal illegal immigrant killers, rapists, and gangbangers.”\n\nRob Bonta, California’s attorney general, sued the Trump administration Monday over its deployment of the National Guard, arguing that doing so infringed on the state’s sovereignty.\n\nRelated | Watch Los Angeles mayor sound alarm on Trump's military invasion\n\nLos Angeles school leaders say they’re prepared for the Trump administration to escalate immigration enforcement, including on campuses. In January, Trump lifted restrictions on immigration enforcement in “sensitive locations,” including schools, churches and hospitals. The policy change has led parents across the country to pull children out of class. During Carvalho’s address on Monday, he said that two federal vans were parked near schools.\n\n“No action has been taken, but we interpret those actions as actions of intimidation, instilling fear that may lead to self-deportation,” he said. “That is not the community we want to be, that is not the state or the nation that we ought to be.”\n\nLAUSD is urging parents or guardians who see immigration activity to contact their school or call the district’s Family Hotline: (213) 443-1300.","summary":"Some parents in the district — which includes an estimated 30,000 immigrant students — plan to sit out commencements over immigration enforcement concerns.\n\n\n\nBy Nadra Nittle for The 19th News\n\n\n\n\nWhat was supposed to be a day of celebration for students at Gratts Learning Academy for Young Scholars turned into one of chaos as immigration enforcement in and around Los Angeles —  along with subsequent protests and attempts to quash them — reportedly left some of their relatives too fearful to attend the elementary school’s graduation.\n\n\n\nGratts is in the city’s Westlake District, where immigration raids Friday led to a showdown between demonstrators and law enforcement agencies that persisted throughout the weekend.

Company denies 2024 rigging claims","text":"A year after Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump in the 2024 US presidential election, a court case in New York has reignited the debate over whether the vote was fair. At the centre is a troubling question: why did some voting machines record no presidential vote at all—even on ballots where voters made clear choices in other races?The Supreme Court of Rockland County is now overseeing a lawsuit that could, for the first time, subject key voting machines to full legal scrutiny. It does not seek to overturn the national result. But it could expose serious flaws in how votes were counted.2024 US Poll: “Zero” votes—but full ballots?The legal complaint, filed by watchdog SMART Legislation, alleges that voting machines in Ramapo recorded zero votes for Kamala Harris in several districts, while the same ballots reflected votes for Senate and House races.“There is clear evidence that the Senate results are incorrect, and there are statistical indications that the presidential results are highly unlikely,” said Lulu Friesdat, executive director of SMART Legislation. “If the results are incorrect, it is a violation of the constitutional rights of each person who voted in the 2024 Rockland County general election.”Voters have filed sworn affidavits stating they did vote for Harris—but their selections were apparently not registered.Friesdat said that only a full hand recount can restore public confidence. “It is vitally important that we examine the results… to be absolutely confident about them.”Kamala Harris Votes: Did the machines fail—or were they modified?Between March and September 2024, Pro V&V approved four updates to voting machine software and firmware across the US. These changes—affecting printers, file locations, ballot bins, and audit functions—were classified by the Election Assistance Commission (EAC) as “de minimis,” or too minor to require public testing.Jack Cobb, Pro V&V’s lab director, rejected the idea that the updates compromised the election.“There really is no change of any significance,” Cobb told Newsweek via email.He insisted that all relevant details were posted on the EAC’s website.But watchdog group SMART Elections sees it differently. In their Substack blog Dissent in Bloom, they wrote:“These weren’t minor tweaks. They touched ballot scanners, modified audit files, and even affected machines flagged by CISA. But by calling them ‘de minimis’, they avoided full testing, public scrutiny, and transparency.”Cobb dismissed these claims as unfounded, “Most of these articles are completely made up.”Judge orders full discovery, September hearing setSupreme Court Judge Rachel Tanguay has ruled that the case deserves further investigation. In a directive issued this month, she gave both parties seven months to complete discovery and set a readiness hearing for 22 September.The ruling allows subpoenas of voting logs, internal communications, and testimony from election officials and machine vendors.Statistical anomalies: “Highly unlikely”Experts reviewing Rockland’s official vote data found several red flags. Independent Senate candidate Diane Sare officially received five votes in District 39. But at least seven voters have filed affidavits saying they selected her.The larger concern is the presidential drop-off rate. Hundreds of ballots marked for Democratic Senate candidate Kirsten Gillibrand showed no vote for president—suggesting an unusually high number of voters skipped the top of the ticket.“The difference in the drop-off rate between the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates is in excess of 30 percent,” the complaint stated.Max Bonamente, a physicist from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, reviewed the data and said, “These data would require extreme sociological or political causes for their explanation, and would benefit from further assurances as to their fidelity.”Company website collapse deepens transparency concernsPublic confidence in the machine certifiers has also taken a hit. Pro V&V’s website was largely offline for months after the election. As of June 2025, it remains a placeholder page with no public database of testing records.“Why would we trust a company that has let its website disintegrate publicly for over six months, to test complex electronic equipment that we rely on to determine who controls the treasury, the military and the policy of our entire nation?” SMART Legislation asked in a public statement.Cobb responded that the site was down briefly in February and is now live, though some parts remain incomplete.Experts divided, but agree on one thing: the results must be verifiedElection expert Costas Panagopoulos of Northeastern University said unusual results should always be checked—but warned against assuming fraud without clear proof.“In this case, the drop-off inconsistencies could reflect the idiosyncratic nature of the 2024 presidential election cycle,” he said. “Alone, statistical comparisons to previous cycles cannot provide definitive proof of wrongdoing.”Still, he agreed that the system must be held to account. “Scrutinising election results can strengthen confidence in elections. Mistakes can happen,” he added.What happens next?The lawsuit will not affect Donald Trump’s certified win, and Harris has not challenged the result. However, if the court finds that votes were wrongly recorded or not counted at all, it could have ripple effects:Future voting machine software may face tougher review processesLawmakers may push for more transparent auditsSome states could reintroduce hand-counted or paper ballotsFor now, the question remains unanswered. Did Harris lose because of voter choice—or machine failure? The court may not settle the politics, but it could clarify the process.","summary":"Kamala Harris 2024 Election result: A lawsuit in Rockland County, New York, has revived questions about the 2024 US presidential election.

In her new book, timed for publication just one year after the 2024 election, Karine Jean-Pierre shares why Americans must begin to look beyond party lines and why she chose to embrace life as an Independent,\" a press release announcing Jean-Pierre's upcoming book, \"Independent,\" stated while revealing that the former spox had ditched the Democratic Party. \"Jean-Pierre didn’t come to her decision to be an Independent lightly, she has served two American presidents, Obama and Biden. . . . She takes us through the three weeks that led to Biden’s abandoning his bid for a second term and the betrayal by the Democratic Party that led to his decision,\" the press release continued. Fox News Digital took a look back at Jean-Pierre's history as press secretary – which spanned from May 13, 2022, until January 20, 2025 – including the most partisan stances and statements she made in defense of the administration as the immigration crisis spiraled to new highs, the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the administration embraced transgender issues, and the White House's heated rhetoric aimed at President Donald Trump ahead of the 2024 election. FORMER BIDEN OFFICIALS RIDICULE KARINE JEAN-PIERRE'S BOOK AS 'BIZARRE CASH GRAB' \"We are not finishing a wall. We are cleaning up the mess that the prior administration made. We are trying to save lives. This is what the prior administration left behind that we are now cleaning up,\" Jean-Pierre declared from the White House briefing room's podium in July of 2022, as the Biden administration said it would not continue work on the Trump administration's border wall. \"A border wall is an ineffective use of taxpayer dollars, so it's ineffective,\" she added. Months later, as Title 42, a Trump-era policy that allowed U.S. officials to turn away migrants who came to the U.S.-Mexico border because of health concerns was set to expire, Jean-Pierre argued, \"It would be wrong to think that the border is open. It is not open.\" BIDEN-ERA WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS EXPRESS DISBELIEF ON KARINE JEAN-PIERRE'S SUDDEN PARTY SWITCH Critics at the time slammed the press secretary over the comment, calling the comment a \"bold-faced lie\" as migrants were seen coming across the border with little consequences. The Biden administration was in power when the Supreme Court issued its landmark decision effectively ending the recognition of abortion as a constitutional right in the Dobbs v. Jackson decision in June of 2022, with Jean-Pierre calling the ruling \"extreme.\" \"When the Supreme Court made that extreme decision on Dobbs, it really put a lot of families and women's lives at risk,\" she said during a press conference in July of 2022. KARINE JEAN-PIERRE SWITCHES AFFILIATION TO INDEPENDENT, RELEASING NEW BOOK ABOUT 'BROKEN' BIDEN WHITE HOUSE The Biden White House frequently celebrated LGBTQ holidays during its four years, including fiercely defending transgender issues and policies that the Trump administration has since ended. \"Tomorrow is Trans Visibility Day,\" Jean-Pierre said during a March 2023 press conference slamming Republicans who put forth legislation that aimed to keep biological boys out of girls' sports and end transgender surgeries for minors. \"On a day that we should be lifting up our trans kids and our trans youth and making sure that they feel seen, we're seen more and more of these hateful, hateful bills.\" \"We've been very clear about these anti-LGBTQ bills that we're seeing in state legislatures across the country, in particular these anti-trans bills, as they attack trans kids, as they attack trans parents. It is shameful, and it is unacceptable,\" she added. In the months leading up to Election Day, Trump faced two separate assassination attempts, including one in Butler, Pennsylvania, during a campaign rally in July that left him with an injury to the side of his head after a bullet whizzed towards him, and another in September when a man attempted to kill Trump while he played golf in Florida. \"It's been only two days since somebody allegedly tried to kill Donald Trump again, and you're here at the podium in the White House briefing room calling him a threat,\" Fox News' Peter Doocy pressed during a news conference in September of 2024. \"How many more assassination attempts on Donald Trump until the president and the vice president and you pick a different word to describe Trump other than ‘threat’?\" Then-Vice President Kamala Harris and Biden had both repeatedly claimed that \"Democracy is on the ballot\" last year amid Trump's re-election campaign. While the White House, Biden and Harris additionally described Trump as a \"threat\" to democracy, Fox Digital previously extensively reported.

People experienced it in different ways, depending on their location. I attended as a spectator — not in the press area, not interviewing people, just watching the parade from a spot on Constitution Ave. near 19th Street. \n\nIt began with Army history. Leading the parade, with horses and the Fife & Drum Corps, were soldiers in the uniform of the Continental Army, formed June 14, 1775. Then came the Civil War and cavalry from the Western Expansion; more period uniforms, horses, and music. Then World War I, with vehicles and an early tank, and “The Caissons Go Rolling Along.” Then World War II, with everything — lots of troops, vehicles, a Sherman tank, and a flyover of a B-25 bomber and P-51 Mustangs. Then Korea and Vietnam, and the Gulf War, and the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, featuring modern equipment and helicopter flyovers. There were M1 Abrams tanks, mobile rocket launchers, Bradley fighting vehicles, and more.\n\nTruth be told, it was a bit too long. But the Army clearly wanted to showcase its famed divisions and corps, green berets, red berets, tan berets, and the various units, plus the U.S. Military Academy and all the equipment, up to today’s drones and robots. There was a lot to show, and producers did not appear to do much cutting.\n\nIt wasn’t flashy. It wasn’t showbizzy. Where I was, the audience did not see or hear the videos and production numbers or President Trump’s speech from the reviewing stand, several blocks to the east. In other words, it was not a Trumpy event. It was not the dictator’s self-congratulation that some critics predicted. It was … an Army parade.\n\nThe crowd seemed big, but not huge, and it was spread across an extended area given the nature of the event. White House spokesman Steven Cheung tweeted, “Amazing. Despite the threat of rain, over 250,000 patriots showed up to celebrate the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army. God Bless the USA!” That is the White House line. All of Trump’s opponents, in the Democratic Party, the media, and elsewhere, will say it was far less. There is no way to know with any certainty, because many years ago, after running into a hornet’s nest of criticism when it released a crowd size estimate that organizers of the Nation of Islam’s Million Man March felt was too low, the National Park Service got out of the business of estimating crowd sizes.\n\nBut there is one important thing to remember about crowd size in the nation’s capital. There is a partisan component. Trump wants to hold big, beautiful events in Washington because the setting is so magnificent. But the District of Columbia, and the surrounding counties in Maryland and Virginia, are heavily, heavily Democratic. Even with Trump’s improved performance in the 2024 election, the District voted 90% for Kamala Harris. In Maryland, Harris’s vote was 74% in Montgomery County and 86% in Prince George’s County. In Virginia, Harris took 78% in Arlington County, 77% in Alexandria, and 66% in Fairfax County.\n\nSo, even with the high military presence in some areas, anybody within easy driving distance or public transportation distance of the parade was likely a Democrat. That is just the way it is. It was true in 2017, when Trump insisted that his inauguration crowd was bigger than it was, and it is true now. For a Republican, it’s not really something to worry about.\n\nThere were a few old peaceniks in my area of the parade route. The whole time, they held up a long banner that said “WAGE PEACE PRACTICE NONVIOLENCE.” It wasn’t a specifically anti-Trump message; they might have brought the same sign to the last military parade in Washington, the Gulf War victory parade, in 1991.\n\nAnother couple of people held up an anti-Trump sign. It was pretty wordy, saying “EVEN THE GENERALS RECOGNIZE HIM AS A FASCIST. WHAT WILL YOU DO WHEN HE AUTHORIZES THE MILITARY TO SUPPRESS PROTEST? WILL YOU JUST FOLLOW ORDERS LIKE GOOD GERMANS? REMEMBER THE WHITE ROSE.” (The last part was a reference to a short-lived anti-Nazi group in Germany during World War II.) The sign irritated a few people standing nearby, but mostly no one paid any attention to it. By the way, no authorities came to remove the sign or take the protesters out of the parade area.\n\nBefore going to the parade on Saturday, I had to run an errand in downtown Bethesda, Maryland. There was a “No Kings” protest going along Wisconsin Ave., meaning cars drove through a long gantlet of older, mostly white, sign-waving protesters. There was a big turnout, just like in other cities around the country. Later, after attending the parade to be able to compare, it was clear that the “No Kings” group was far less diverse than the crowd at the parade. In commentary on the right, “No Kings” has been ridiculed as a bunch of angry old people, which was certainly what it appeared to be in Bethesda.\n\nOne more thing about “No Kings.” The idea behind the nationwide movement was to create a narrative that Trump’s opposition dwarfs his support, and that opposition is growing as everyday Americans are shocked by Trump’s actions. Organizers will say, just look at the demonstrations across the country — millions of people coming out to protest Trump — and then compare that to his puny parade in Washington. We are the real majority!\n\nIt’s a tough case to make after the last election, but they’re working hard at it. Still, the debate misses the point of the Army 250th birthday parade. It was about the Army, the Army’s history, and honoring the Army. And that was a good thing.","summary":"THE PARADE WAS A GOOD THING. Here&#8217;s the first thing to say about Saturday&#8217;s military parade in Washington, D.C., honoring the Army&#8217;s 250th birthday: It was a good thing to do.

Përfaqësuesit e çiftit nuk iu përgjigjën menjëherë kërkesave për koment për NYT.\nGrupi vokal Boyz II Men performoi në dasmë, sipas dy prej pjesëmarrësve, dhe folësit që mbajtën dolli përfshinin vëllain e z. Soros, Jonathan, znj. Clinton, znj. Wintour dhe z. Rama. Pjatat përfshinin agnolotti me tartuf, supë angleze me bizele të ftohta dhe një bavette amerikane Wagyu dhe karkaleca të pjekur në skarë.\nFestimet rastësisht përkuan me një fundjavë jashtëzakonisht kaotike brenda dhe jashtë vendit. Protestuesit u mblodhën në të gjithë vendin për të kundërshtuar Presidentin Trump edhe pse ai mbajti një paradë ushtarake të pazakontë në Uashington; një ligjvënës i Minesotës u vra në një shpërthim të ri të dhunës politike; dhe sulmet midis Izraelit dhe Iranit ngjallën frikën e një zjarri më të gjerë në Lindjen e Mesme.\nGjithçka ishte shumë më e qetë në Hamptons, ndërsa karvanë me SUV të zinj transportuan pjesëmarrësit në dasëm nëpër një rrugicë të ngushtë me gjethe dhe përmes një porte të rrethuar nga lule vjollcë.\nZ. Soros është një nga figurat më intriguese në botën e donatorëve. Mbajtësi i një diplome doktorature në histori, ai ka marrë kryesisht përsipër dhënien e drejtuar për dekada nga babai i tij, tani 94 vjeç, i cili ka mbështetur kauzat liberale në të gjithë botën dhe është bërë një gangster për krahun e djathtë. Z. Soros më i ri e ka quajtur veten \"më politik\" sesa babai i tij.\nSoros, 39 vjeç, gjithashtu ka zbuluar se ndihet rehat në qendër të vëmendjes dhe ka postuar me forcë në mediat sociale ndërsa ka detajuar takimet e tij me udhëheqësit demokratë. Ai ka të ngjarë të jetë një pjesë e madhe e skenës së filantropisë liberale për dekada dhe shumë në qarqet progresive duan të qëndrojnë pranë tij.\nRomanca e tij me znj. Abedin, 49 vjeç, ka magjepsur pjesë të shoqërisë së lartë. Kjo pjesërisht për shkak se martesa e saj e fundit u përkeqësua në një mënyrë spektakolare: ish-burri i saj, ish-përfaqësuesi Anthony Weiner, u përfshi në skandale të shumta sexting përpara se ajo të njoftonte ndarjen e tyre në vitin 2016.\nZ. Soros dhe znj. Abedin njoftuan fejesën e tyre korrikun e kaluar. Ata fillimisht planifikuan të arratiseshin, raportoi Vogue të shtunën, por ata ndryshuan mendje pas një feste fejese të bashkë-organizuar nga znj. Clinton në dhjetor, ku pjesëmarrësit ushtruan presion mbi çiftin për të mbajtur një festë më tradicionale.\n\"Mendoj se ajo e meriton,\" i tha znj. Clinton revistës. \"Ajo e meriton të ketë atë lloj momenti.\"\nFestimet e fundjavës përfshinin një ceremoni më të vogël të premten për të nderuar si besimin mysliman të znj. Abedin ashtu edhe trashëgiminë hebraike të z. Soros. Një rabin dhe një imam kryesuan ceremoninë, sipas njerëzve që ishin atje.\nNë ndryshim nga z. Soros, znj. Abedin ka treguar një dëshirë për privatësi. Ajo filloi të punonte për znj. Clinton si një praktikante 19-vjeçare ndërsa ndiqte Universitetin George Washington dhe gradualisht hyri në role më të përballura me publikun. Ajo shkroi një kujtim në vitin 2021 dhe tani është një bashkëpunëtore e MSNBC.\nTani, martesa e saj me z.

Boelter fled on foot after exchanging gunfire with officers after the second shooting.Officials have issued security alerts in South Dakota and other states as the hunt proceeds, US Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota said Sunday as she mourned her slain friend, Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman. I am concerned about all our political leaders, political organizations, she said. It was politically motivated, and there clearly was some throughline with abortion because of the groups that were on the list, and other things that I've heard were in this manifesto. So that was one of his motivations. As speaker of the Minnesota House of Representatives, Hortman was committed to legislation that protected reproductive rights in the state, local media reported.America is bitterly divided politically as President Donald Trump embarks on his second term and routinely insults his opponents. Political violence is becoming more and more common.Trump himself survived an assassination attempt last year. An assailant with a hammer attacked the husband of then US House speaker Nancy Pelosi in 2022. And Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro's house was set on fire this year. We need to bring the tone down, Klobuchar said on CNN.US Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, himself attacked by a neighbor in 2017, told NBC nothing brings us together more than, you know, mourning for somebody else who's in political life, Republican or Democrats. On Saturday the FBI released a photo that appears to show Boelter wearing a mask as he stands outside the home of one of the lawmakers.It is offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest and conviction.The shootings came on the day a dramatic split screen showed America divided: hundreds of thousands of protesters across the country took to the streets to rally against Trump as the president presided over a big military parade in Washington -- a rare spectacle criticized as seeking to glorify him.Trump has condemned the killing of Hortman and her husband Mark and the wounding of state Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette.In a conversation Sunday with ABC News, Trump was asked if he planned to call Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, who was Kamala Harris's running mate in the election Trump won last year. Well, it's a terrible thing. I think he's a terrible governor. I think he's a grossly incompetent person, the president said.

Gavin Newsom pointed fingers at the Trump administration for its policy of deporting criminals.\n\nThe legacy media provided aid and comfort to the rioters, as usual.\n\nPresident Trump, by contrast, took action — sending the National Guard and Marines to maintain civility.\n\nAmid the unrest, arrests were made, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents continued their efforts to detain the most dangerous illegal immigrants, even at the risk to their own safety.\n\nYet the riots showed that as we confront the challenge of removing millions of illegal aliens, we also need to stop criminals who resort to violence to disrupt our efforts. \n\nTo do that, DHS needs more resources and manpower — specifically, more federal law-enforcement officers, more detention beds and more transportation for removals.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill gets us all three.\n\nFirst, the BBB will allow ICE to hire 10,000 new officers. It’ll also provide Customs and Border Protection funding for 5,000 more customs officers and 3,000 new Border Patrol agents.\n\nICE currently has 20,000 law-enforcement and support personnel in more than 400 offices.

John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette.\n\nCops are on the hunt for the suspect, Vance Luther Boetler, 57, a political appointee of Gov. Tim Walz, who allegedly left behind a sick “manifesto” listing the names of 70 politicians, including Walz, according to authorities.\n\nJust days earlier, on June 10, Hortman cast the decisive vote on a state budget bill that stripped access to MinnesotaCare benefits for illegal migrants over the age of 18.\n\n“I did what leaders do, I stepped up and I got the job done for the people of Minnesota,” she told KTTC-TV, adding that she understood the anger of her fellow DFL members.\n\n“They’re right to be mad at me. I think some of them are pretty, pretty angry. I think that their job was to make folks who voted for that bill feel like crap, and I think that they succeeded,” she said.\n\nShe appeared visibly upset as she said she had voted for the healthcare provision solely to uphold the budget deal, which was later passed by the state Senate. Walz is expected to sign the budget into law. \n\n“I know that people will be hurt by that vote, and we worked very hard to get a budget deal that didn’t include that provision,” she told the House on Tuesday following a four-hour debate, \n\nThe state legislature in Saint Paul is extremely narrowly divided. The state House is controlled by Republicans, who have a majority of just one seat (67-66) and the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (as Minnesota Dems are called) holds the state Senate by the same margin (34-33).\n\nState Sen. Hoffman voted against the healthcare proposal, Alpha News reported.\n\nAlthough Saturday’s killings are believed to be political, the specific motive for the shootings is not yet known.\n\nA photograph of a series of signs reading “No Kings” found in the suspect’s vehicle was shared by the Minnesota State Patrol in a post on X on Saturday.\n\nThe slogan has become a calling card for the nationwide anti-Trump protests planned over the weekend, including several across the North Star State.\n\nA chilling picture believed to show Boetler wearing a creepy latex mask in doorbell cam footage was shared by the FBI on Saturday.\n\nHe also sent a haunting last text message to a friend, David Carlson, at around 6 a.m. on Saturday, shortly after the shootings.\n\n“David and Ron, I love you guys. I made some choices, and you guys don’t know anything about this, but I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both, and I wish it hadn’t gone this way,” Carlson read from his phone while sitting on the front stoop, video shared by the Minnesota Star Tribune shows.\n\nFurther shocking details have emerged about this weekend’s shootings.\n\nOne of the victims, Yvette Hoffman, used her body as a human shield to save her daughter’s life, her nephew said.\n\n“Early this morning, an absolute vile piece of s–t dressed as a cop broke into my aunt and uncle’s house and shot him 6 times and my aunt 5 times in a political act of terrorism. My aunt threw herself on her daughter, using her body as a shield to save her life,” Mat Ollig wrote on Facebook.\n\nTributes have been paid to Hortman, a longtime speaker of the state House until Republicans won control, and her husband from across the political aisle.\n\n“A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place,” Walz wrote on X.\n\n“She served the people of Minnesota with grace, compassion, and tirelessness. Minnesota’s thoughts are with her loved ones, and my prayers are with Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette, who were shot and wounded and are being treated,” Walz’s former running mate of Kamala Harris wrote.\n\nPresident Trump said he had been briefed on the “terrible shooting” in Minnesota in a post on Truth Social on Saturday.\n\n“Our Attorney General, Pam Bondi, and the FBI, are investigating the situation, and they will be prosecuting anyone involved to the fullest extent of the law. Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America.

He declined to share details about the conversation, which he brought up as Trump vocally criticized California governor Gavin Newsom’s response to anti-immigration and customs enforcement (Ice) protests in Los Angeles.\n\nNewsom, who is not running for re-election because of term limits, has since sued Trump over his decision to send in military personnel to LA amid the Ice protests.\n\nPolitico reported in March that Harris was weighing a run to succeed Newsom, her fellow Democrat, after she lost the presidential election in November to Trump. Citing sources close to her, the outlet added that Harris – a former US senator for California – was giving herself until the end of the summer to make a final decision.\n\nCalifornia’s Republicans “would love” Harris to run for governor because they believe it might vault the race into the national conversation and “create a fundraising bonanza” that could benefit them in what is otherwise a staunchly Democratic state, Politico has also written.\n\nGrenell has a home in the LA area. He has previously been an ambassador to Germany, acting director of national intelligence and Trump’s envoy for special missions. He was more recently involved in securing the release of Americans detained in Venezuela. And, in February, Trump made him the interim director of the Kennedy Center.\n\nIn his talk with Burns, Grenell also addressed the mixed reaction that greeted Trump Wednesday when he attended a performance of Les Misérables at the Kennedy Center.\n\nGrenell maintained that the Kennedy Center is “much more tolerant” nowadays despite boos being directed at Trump on Wednesday, when he also got some cheers.\n\n“We want people here who sit next to each other, who voted for somebody completely different for president,” Grenell, the first openly gay person to lead the US intelligence community, said to Burns. “No one gets vocal and no one gets into an argument because we’re watching Les Mis.\n\n“You know – that’s the whole idea of tolerance.”","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-ally-ric-grenell-says-123017002.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/7d6e802b617b2ea2ed497d1dd86957ba","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 12:30:17","author":"Ramon Antonio Vargas","authors":["Ramon Antonio Vargas"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":331624660,"title":"Dasma e Alex Soros dhe Huma Abedin bën bashkë personalitetet demokrate në SHBA, Rama dhe Hillary Clinton fjalim urimi për çiftin","text":"Establishmenti demokrat u mblodh këtë fundjavë në Hamptons për një dasmë që ngjante me një kurorëzim mbretëror në botën e politikës – një event që bashkoi botën e politikës me shumë para me figurat më me ndikim të epokës Clinton.\n\nPërtej familjarëve të çiftit, në listën e të ftuarve ishin: Hillary dhe Bill Clinton; nënpresidentja Kamala Harris me bashkëshortin Doug Emhoff; senatori Chuck Schumer nga Nju Jorku, udhëheqës i pakicës; ish-kryetarja e Dhomës së Përfaqësuesve Nancy Pelosi; yje si Nicky Hilton Rothschild; figura të botës së kulturës si drejtoresha e Vogue, Anna Wintour; miq të vjetër të Clintonëve si Susie Tompkins Buell, një lobiste me peshë nga San Francisko; dhe madje edhe figura të huaja si kryeministri i Shqipërisë, Edi Rama.\n\nKy parakalim yjesh u përshkrua nga katër të pranishëm në dasmë si dhe nga disa përfaqësues të të ftuarve.

Protestues dolën në rrugë anembanë vendit për të kundërshtuar presidentin Trump, ndërkohë që ky i fundit organizoi një paradë ushtarake të pazakontë në Uashington; një ligjvënës nga Minnesota u vra në një shpërthim të ri dhune politike; dhe përplasjet mes Izraelit dhe Iranit ushqyen frikën e një konflikti më të gjerë në Lindjen e Mesme.\n\nPor në Hamptons gjithçka ishte më e qetë, ndërsa kolona me SUV të zeza sillnin të ftuarit përgjatë një rruge të ngushtë të rrethuar me pyje dhe kalonin një portë të zbukuruar me lule vjollcë.\n\nAlex Soros është një nga figurat më intriguese në botën e donatorëve.

Djali Soros është shprehur se vetë ai është “më politik” se i ati.\n\nAlex, 39 vjeç, i pëlqen vëmendja publike, dhe është aktiv në rrjetet sociale, ku ndan takimet me liderë demokratë.

Trump: A defining moment for America or the California governor’s shot at presidency?","text":"Ever since President Trump sent the National Guard to Los Angeles to quell protests against an immigrant crackdown, California Gov. Gavin Newsom has emerged as a strident and ubiquitous antagonist to Trump’s military deployment on American streets, describing it as unconstitutional “madness.”\n\nTrump’s actions have “defined a serious and profound moment in American history,” he told New York Times podcaster Michael Barbaro on Thursday’s “The Daily.”\n\nFor the Democrat whose statewide term ends after the 2026 election, and who is widely considered a presidential contender in 2028, is this also a defining moment for him?\n\nMore clashes were expected Saturday when U.S. Army tanks rolling down Washington, D.C., streets during Trump’s military parade contrast with what were expected to be some 1,500 separate “No Kings” demonstrations against his administration in cities across the country.\n\nFor Newsom, what started Tuesday with a primetime speech warning that “democracy is under assault” cascaded into a daily onslaught of taunts, insults and threats attacking President Trump and his team, all spun out in interviews, social media posts and viral memes.\n\nWhen Trump said he got tough in a phone call with Newsom in the early days of the L.A. protests, Newsom called the president a “stone cold liar.” When Trump’s “border czar” Tom Homan suggested Newsom could be arrested if his sanctuary policies impeded ICE officers (and Trump later agreed Newsom’s arrest would be “a great thing”) the governor posted on TikTok for Homan to “come and get me, tough guy.”\n\nNewsom’s barrage of attacks has left many demoralized Democrats hoping this is the anti-Trump leader for whom they’ve been waiting. But others wonder whether Newsom has chosen the wrong battle — that his larger principle of fighting for “democracy over authoritarianism” will be lost in a hail of images of protesters waving Mexican flags amid burning cars, and will only reinforce a running GOP narrative that Democrats are the party of a woke ideology and lawlessness.\n\n“It’s a very fraught issue for the governor to take a stand on because he has to walk a very fine line,” said political science professor Melissa Michelson of Menlo College. “A lot of Americans supported Trump because of his promise for massive deportations.”\n\nFor all the talk of the 57-year-old Newsom as the face of the Trump resistance — and a naturally telegenic one at that with his slicked-back hair recently fading to a distinguished gray — former Republican strategist Bill Whalen said Democrats “hyperventilating” about his presidential chances in 2028 “really need to take a chill pill.”\n\nJust two months ago, “the media went crazy,” he said, when U.S. Rep. Cory Booker gave a marathon speech protesting Trump and Elon Musk’s cuts to government agencies. They did the same with U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in April, he said, during the “Fight Oligarchy” tour through California’s Central Valley with Sen. Bernie Sanders and again a few weeks later when Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker delivered a rousing speech about fighting for democracy.\n\n“We have to think about this in moments,” said Whalen, a Hoover Institute distinguished policy fellow, “and Gavin Newsom is having his moment.”\n\nThe confrontation began last weekend when Trump ordered 2,000 National Guard troops into Los Angeles following two days of unrest after an ICE immigration crackdown that started in a Home Deport parking lot. Newsom said Trump’s move was unconstitutional and only served to “inflame tensions,” since the National Guard hasn’t been summoned over a governor’s objection in 60 years.\n\nBut Whalen, a former speech writer for former California Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, said Newsom’s lofty speech fell into the same trap that doomed former Vice President Kamala Harris, a fellow Californian, in her campaign last fall against Trump. His “authoritarian rant” may have appealed to coastal elites, he said, but not to Trump voters who care about crime, illegal immigration and the economy.\n\n“He is not winning over the unconverted. And therein lies the challenge,” Whalen said. “Take that speech and tell me how that changes him going to Ohio or Pennsylvania or any swing state in America.”\n\nNewsom’s TikTok posts, however, some set to hip-hop music, are gaining traction with a young audience, such as a post about the state suing the Trump administration over the deployment of the National Guard, seen by millions.\n\nNewsom has been capturing the national spotlight since the early 2000s when, as San Francisco mayor, he defied state law and officiated same sex marriages at City Hall. During Trump’s first run for president in 2016, he defended California as a sanctuary state for immigrants living in the U.S. without permission.\n\nBut after Trump was inaugurated for his second term earlier this year, Newsom moved into a role as conciliator, inviting nationally known conservatives onto his podcast to seek common ground and grabbing headlines (and shocking progressives) when he agreed that transgender athletes competing in girls sports was “deeply unfair.”\n\nHis actions are part of a plan by the governor and his team to position Newsom for his next big move, said Sonoma State Political Science Professor David McCuan.\n\n“They want to create a new type of Democrat and something that blends Ronald Reagan and Morning in America with Bill Clinton’s retail politics skills and Obama’s charisma,” McCuan said. “They want to roll that all into one Democratic cigar that he can smoke all the way through.”\n\nThis latest fight with Trump, despite the harsh rhetoric, McCuan said, is advantageous for both politicians.\n\n“This is a made-for-television moment that both these individuals understand and creates this bromance between them,” McCuan said. “And while Donald Trump may be this East Coast guy leading this MAGA movement, he recognizes that there is an ambitious politician that potentially is a threat. Just like Democrats overreact to Donald Trump — anything he does, the sky is falling — Republicans and the right and their media circles overreact to anything the limousine liberal from San Francisco does. It is like red meat and tofu for each audience.”\n\nNo matter how skillfully Newsom may explain to Americans that he supports peaceful protests and opposes violence, or provides sanctuary for law-abiding immigrants but helps ICE deport violent criminal ones, he still carries political baggage — including his inability to solve the state’s twin crises of homelessness and housing affordability, pundits say.\n\n“It remains to be seen whether he can make that work, and he can put his missteps behind him and get folks to take him at his word and think that he is being sincere,” said Michelson of Menlo College. He will need to “overcome the skepticism that folks naturally have of the governor these days that everything he’s doing is an attempt to set himself up as a presidential candidate.”","summary":"Newsom’s barrage of attacks have left many demoralized Democrats hoping this is the anti-Trump leader they’ve been waiting for, but others wonder whether the governor has chosen the wrong battle.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/15/newsom-v-trump-a-defining-moment-for-america-or-the-california-governors-shot-at-presidency/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/BRN-L-ELIAS-COL-0509-1.jpg?w=1024&h=684","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 11:00:13","author":"Julia Prodis Sulek","authors":["Julia Prodis Sulek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.063},{"id":331614708,"title":"Why 'monstrify'? Look at who benefits when few are considered fully human","text":"In March, the Trump administration deported 238 Venezuelans to El Salvador, allegedly for membership in the criminal organization Tren de Aragua. According to White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, these men were “terrorists” and “heinous monsters.” President Trump echoed her, calling them “monsters” on his social media platform, Truth Social. In May, ProPublica reported that the White House knew that most of the men had no criminal convictions in the U.S., and earlier reporting indicated that more than 50 of them had entered the U.S. legally and had not violated immigration law. “Monster” conjures a threat distinct from “foreign,” “different,” “other” or even “alien.” Here it implies that the deportees are different from “normal” people (read “white, Anglo, native-born Americans”) in ways that go beyond merely committing a garden-variety crime. Their transgression of the social contract seemingly even exceeds the violent crimes of which they are accused, because U.S. citizens suspected of being “rapists, murders, kidnappers” — the administration’s allegations about these “monsters” — don’t get trafficked to gulags overseas. Monstrifying these people was part of a strategy to justify deporting them by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 without proof of any crime or gang membership. By doing so the administration threatens to normalize not just the deportation of a handful of individuals but also depriving all residents (legal and undocumented) and U.S. citizens of the right to challenge the legality of their detention or imprisonment. Because one cannot prove legal residence or citizenship without due process, deporting people without legal proceedings is to deny rights that must be extended to all if they are to exist for anyone — a violation all the greater when individuals are sent to a prison from which, in the words of the Salvadoran president, “the only way out is in a coffin.” Monstrifying individuals and groups is nothing new. The 11th-century chronicler Gerald of Wales, descended from Norman conquerers and Welsh nobility, dismissed the English as “the most worthless of all peoples under heaven … the most abject slaves” and Ireland as an island inhabited by werewolves, ox-humans and other human-animal hybrids. In 1625, an English Puritan travel editor published a claim (without having set foot in North America) that the Algonquians had “little of humanitie but shape … more brutish than the beasts they hunt.” In 1558, the Scottish Protestant and firebrand preacher John Knox published a pamphlet against the rule of Mary I of England, arguing that a woman who ruled in her own right was “a monster of monsters,” her country a monstrous body politic, unlikely to survive for long. In the age of Atlantic slavery, legal instruments known as “black codes” invented Black Africans transported to the colonies as a new category: the chattel slave who served for life and had fewer rights than white Christian servants. The current president’s history of monstrifying people extends to U.S. citizens. In August 2016, Trump called Hillary Clinton “a monster”: supposedly “weak,” “unhinged,” “unbalanced,” someone who would be “a disaster” as president and who allegedly threatened “the destruction of this country from within.” In October 2020, Trump twice called Kamala Harris “this monster.” The distinctions drawn by people in power trying to divide a population are often unworkable. How do you tell a law-abiding person from a terrorist gang member? From their tattoos, according to this administration. Neither citizenship nor immigration status is visible on a person’s body or audible in their voice, yet people of color of every immigration and citizenship status have long faced racial profiling. Attempts to define visible signs of the monster are not new either; nor is the fact that monster-making sweeps up an immense number of people in its dragnet. But monsters are never hermetically sealed from the group whose borders they were invented to define. This ham-fisted attempt at an evidence-based reason for trafficking people to El Salvador echoes earlier attempts to identify distinct groups in a population where human variety existed on a continuum. Notorious among these examples was the monstrification and mass slaughter, in Nazi Germany, of Jewish, Roma, Sinti, LGBTQ+, disabled and neurodiverse individuals as well as political dissidents. In the U.S. today, to tolerate, permit or encourage the monstrification of any non-citizen and consequently deny them due process is to tolerate, permit and encourage this to happen to U.S. citizens. The category of the human is shrinking as politicians, tech bros and right-wing pundits monstrify everyone who isn’t a cis-het white man. Today’s dehumanizing language extends beyond the Venezuelan deportees that this administration labeled as “monsters.” It extends to women, minorities and LGBTQ+ people by questioning their right to bodily autonomy, privacy and dignity. It extends to people who are unhoused, poor, disabled or elderly, as social services are cut. These narratives hail back to a broader, centuries-long Western tradition of gazing at other people and framing them as monstrous: as beings who supposedly broke the category of “human” and could be legitimately denied of fundamental rights. Monster-making campaigns always serve a purpose. For European colonizers, claiming that Indigenous people were less than human disguised European land grabs. Laws defining enslaved Black Africans as chattel property legalized their enslavement and broke the labor solidarity between white servants and enslaved Africans. And the Nazis claimed that Jews and other minorities had caused Germany to lose the First World War and were responsible for the nation’s economic collapse. Again today, the goals of monstrification serve the myth of white supremacy, including the notion that the U.S. was meant to be a white ethnostate. Thus while the Trump administration terminated a program for refugees fleeing Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, it welcomed white Afrikaners from South Africa by calling them refugees. Furthermore, by exploiting Jews’ proximity to whiteness, this administration is monstrifying Palestinians in order to justify the Israeli government’s human rights violations. By declaring that protesters, including those who are Jewish, calling for an end to the Gaza slaughter are antisemitic, and by withholding research funds from and interfering with universities by calling them hotbeds of antisemitism, the administration attempts to convince people that Palestinian civilians do not deserve food, homes, safety or even life — and that recognizing the humanity of Jews requires denying that Palestinians are human and have human rights. Yet the administration’s own antisemitism is clear: Trump has pardoned leaders of antisemitic and white supremacist organizations and hosted prominent antisemites as dinner guests. This multi-pronged campaign of monstrification strengthens the personal loyalty of white supremacists and Christian nationalists towards Trump and sows discord and poisons solidarity among his targets and critics. Monstrifying narratives have been undermining the possibility of a more inclusive body politic for millennia. But there’s an antidote to us-them messages of hate, fear and exclusion that claim that only a tiny minority of people are truly human. That antidote is to realize that by recognizing the humanity of others we don’t disavow our own humanity: We demonstrate it. It behooves us to demand that all people receive equal protection under the law, and to call out monstrifying narratives that, in the end, dehumanize us all.

An online resume describes him as a security contractor with experience in the Middle East and Africa, along with past managerial roles in Minnesota companies.\n\nA Minnesota official told The Associated Press news agency on condition of anonymity that Boelter’s writings contained information targeting prominent lawmakers who have championed abortion rights.\n\nAccording to the Minnesota Star Tribune, Boelter sent texts to friends hours after the shootings, saying he had “made some choices” and adding: “I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way … I’m sorry for all the trouble this has caused.”\n\n‘Stand against political violence’\n\nHortman, a mother of two who had served 20 years in the Minnesota House of Representatives, was remembered by Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as someone with “grace, compassion and tirelessness”.\n\nWalz, who was Kamala Harris’s Democratic vice presidential running mate in last year’s presidential election, said the attacker went to the Hortmans’ residence after shooting the Hoffmans multiple times in their home in Champlin.\n\n“We must all, in Minnesota and across the country, stand against all forms of political violence,” said Walz, a Democrat. He also ordered flags to fly at half-staff in Hortman’s honour.\n\n“Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!” President Donald Trump said in a statement.\n\nThe shootings happened at a time when political leaders nationwide have been attacked, harassed and intimidated amid deep political divisions in the US.\n\nIn April, a suspect set fire to the home of Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, forcing him and his family to flee during the Jewish holiday of Passover. The suspect said he planned to beat Shapiro with a small sledgehammer if he found him, according to court documents.\n\nIn July 2024, Trump was grazed on the ear by one of a hail of bullets that killed one of his supporters. Two months later, a man near Trump’s Florida golf course with a rifle was discovered and arrested.\n\nOther incidents include a 2022 hammer attack on the husband of then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in their San Francisco home and a 2020 plot by antigovernment hardliners to kidnap Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer and start a civil war.\n\nSenate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said he asked Capitol police to “immediately increase security” for Minnesota Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith.","summary":"Search continues for Vance Luther Boelter, who allegedly killed Democratic politician Melissa Hortman and her husband.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/15/manhunt-under-way-in-us-for-suspect-who-shot-minnesota-lawmakers?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025-06-15T030604Z_1877632963_RC2P2FA7JQVZ_RTRMADP_3_MINNESOTA-SHOOTING-1749971457.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 09:15:37","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":331587326,"title":"Manhunt underway for suspect in deadly shooting of Democratic state lawmakers","text":"He fled on foot after firing at police at the home of slain former Minnesota House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said the suspect abandoned a vehicle that looked like a police SUV, in which officers found a \"manifesto\" and a target list of other politicians and institutions.\n\nBoelter should be considered armed and dangerous and is believed to still be in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans told a news briefing, adding that it was too soon to determine a motive.\n\nThe suspect had links to evangelical ministries and claimed to be a security expert with experience in the Gaza Strip and Africa, according to online postings and public records reviewed by Reuters. Boelter also described himself online as a former employee of food service companies and was appointed in 2016 by Mr Walz's predecessor to the advisory Governor's Workforce Development Board, according to state records.\n\nDavid Carlson, 59, told Reuters that he has been sharing a house in Minneapolis with Boelter for a little more than a year and last saw him on Friday night. Then about 6am (11am GMT) on Saturday, he received a text from Boelter.\n\n\"He said that he might be dead soon,\" said Mr Carlson, who called police.\n\nThe list found in the vehicle abandoned by the suspect contained about 70 names, including abortion providers, and lawmakers in Minnesota and other states, CNN reported, citing law enforcement sources. Officials said the Hortmans and the other victims — state Senator John Hoffman and his wife — were on the list.\n\nABC News, also citing law enforcement officials, said the list included dozens of Minnesota Democrats, including Mr Walz, US Representative Ilhan Omar, Senator Tina Smith and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.\n\n'Targeted political violence'\n\nMelissa Hortman, a 55-year-old mother of two who had served 20 years in the Minnesota House of Representatives, was remembered by Mr Walz as someone with \"grace, compassion and tirelessness.\"\n\nMr Walz, who was Kamala Harris' Democratic vice presidential running mate in last year's election, said the gunman went to the Hortmans' residence after shooting the Hoffmans multiple times in their home in the nearby town of Champlin.\n\nThe Hoffmans underwent surgery, Mr Walz said, adding that he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that they would survive \"this assassination attempt.\"\n\n\"This was an act of targeted political violence,\" he said. \"Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.\"\n\nThe shootings prompted reactions of shock and horror from Republican and Democratic politicians across the country and calls for dialing back increasingly divisive political rhetoric.\n\nThe incident comes on the heels of a heated hearing in Congress on Thursday, in which Mr Walz and two other Democratic governors defended their states' policies to maintain sanctuary for undocumented immigrants, drawing attacks from Republicans who support US president Donald Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\nThe Minnesota State Patrol chief, Colonel Christina Bogojevic, said police had found flyers in the suspect's vehicle with \"No Kings\" printed on them but that he had no direct links to the thousands of nationwide \"No Kings\" protests on Saturday against Mr Trump's policies.\n\nThe protests were timed to counter Mr Trump's long-sought military parade in Washington. The organising No Kings Coalition cancelled all protests in Minnesota, citing a shelter-in-place order and the suspect's at-large status.\n\nMr Trump said he was briefed on the \"terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers.\"\n\n\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\" Mr Trump said in a statement.\n\nMs Hortman and her husband were shot dead in their home in Brooklyn Park, Mr Walz said.

Melissa Hortman - the senior Democratic state assemblywoman and former assembly speaker in Minnesota who was fatally shot along with her husband on Saturday - was remembered by Governor Tim Walz as someone with \"grace, compassion, and tirelessness.\"\n\nThe lawmaker and her husband, Mark Hortman, were killed by a suspected gunman posing as a police officer in an apparent \"politically motivated assassination,\" according to Walz.\n\nThey were married for 31 years and had two children.\n\nThe lawmaker was elected to the Minnesota Legislature in 2004, according to the Minnesota House of Representatives website. Among issues she focused on were environmental causes, racial equality, reproductive rights and stricter gun control.\n\nAdvocacy groups pointed to her support for police reforms after the 2020 murder of George Floyd, a Black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. She helped advance a legislation that banned police choke holds.\n\nFormer U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris described Hortman as an \"outstanding public servant.\" Harris added: \"She passed legislation that enshrined freedoms and increased opportunity for the people of Minnesota. I saw her impact firsthand when I was with her in Minnesota.\"\n\nHortman held a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science and philosophy from Boston University and a Master's of Public Administration from the Harvard Kennedy School.\n\nShe also worked as an intern for former U.S. Senator Al Gore and as a legislative correspondent for former U.S. Senator John Kerry, according to local media.\n\n\"A formidable public servant and a fixture of the state Capitol, Melissa Hortman woke up every day determined to make our state a better place.

Outside politics, she worked as a private attorney and volunteered at the local school board and Sunday school at Saint Timothy Catholic Church in Blaine, according to ABC News.\n\nThe Minnesota House of Representatives Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Caucus said Hortman \"talked a lot about following the Golden Rule, and the value that 'to whom much is given, much is expected.' She felt she had the ability and the obligation to serve others.\"\n\nMinnesota state Senator John Hoffman and his wife were also shot multiple times in their home on Saturday but Walz said he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that they would survive \"this assassination attempt\" as they underwent surgery.\n\nHortman and her husband were shot dead in their home in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Park.

Hockey games, Ohio State football matches, mountain hikes. All ‘typical American guy’ stuff.\n\nThe Republican also stood by his son’s side when he was bed-bound after undergoing a mastectomy, or top surgery, to have his breasts removed when he was 19.\n\n‘Ashton is 32, so he’s transitioned successfully,’ Rick told Metro of his son, who is trans. \n\n‘Was it a challenge being his dad as he transitioned at age 19? Yes, but only because I didn’t know what I was doing.’\n\nAshton, however, did. Rick helped his son get whatever healthcare he needed to transition, seeing Ashton as his ‘guide’.\n\n‘My son was meant to be a man,’ Rick added. ‘He has a masculine soul, I really believe that.’\n\n Rick Colby and his son, Ashton (Picture: Rick Colby)\n\n Ashton was featured in a video campaign, ‘Here We Are’, by GLAAD, displayed in Times Square last June (Picture: Rick Colby/Alizayuh)\n\nBut a growing number of politicians and pundits say otherwise.\n\nOver the past five years, Republican state lawmakers have pushed a barrage of bills to restrict the lives of trans people, including prohibiting their choice of public toilets and withdrawing the medical care they receive.\n\nSince Donald Trump came to power, the White House has joined them by limiting the sports teams they can play for and pledging to remove them from serving in the army.\n\n‘The current political environment is awful right now,’ Rick said. ‘Transgender people are being villainised, mocked, insulted and blocked from receiving healthcare.\n\n‘One trans woman Ashton and I know left the country to start over somewhere else.’\n\nOutlining his reasons for voting for Trump, he said: ‘I believed the United States was staring into the abyss – and if Kamala Harris got elected, the nation would be destroyed. She would continue the failed and destructive policies of Biden, who I believe was the worst president in American history. \n\n‘That was the choice I had to make. Destroy the country or support transgender people. And the battle at the state level would continue, no matter how I voted.’\n\nHe added he was surprised by his party’s actions following Trump’s second election to office, stating that he wasn’t expecting the party to be as rigid as they have been over trans rights.\n\n‘Republicans are terrible on transgender issues, yes, but I didn’t think they would go as extreme as they have,’ he said. ‘Many of the policies enacted by President Trump and at the state level by Republicans are malevolent and outright harassment, serving no public policy benefit.\n\n‘Does that distress me? Of course it does. But we still have free speech in America and Ashton and I will continue to advocate and do all we can.\n\n‘Do I believe we will eventually win? Yes. When my son Ashton’s generation takes the reins of leadership in our society, being transgender won’t be a big deal at all. But it’s going to be rough going until that time.’\n\nMany are leaving Tennessee, too, after a law was passed in 2023 prohibiting medical providers from prescribing puberty-delaying medication, providing hormone therapy or performing surgery to treat what the law calls ‘purported discomfort or distress from a discordance between the minor’s sex and asserted identity’.\n\n At least 20 states have outlawed, to some degree, gender-affirming healthcare for trans young people (Picture: Getty Images/Bryan Dozier)\n\n Rick worries that, if such a ban were in place when his son was younger, he would have been unable to get him the healthcare he needed (Picture: Rick Colby)\n\nColby, who voted for Trump last year, is one of countless families closely watching a lawsuit that hopes to overturn the Tennessee ban.\n\nLW v Skrmetti, referring to Tennessee attorney general Jonathan Skrmetti, was filed in 2023 and has made its way to the Supreme Court. A ruling is expected this month.\n\nThe plaintiffs, three families and a doctor, say the law violates the Constitution by denying equal protection to trans people.\n\nJ Matthew Rice, Tennessee’s solicitor general, has argued the law was passed for medical reasons and is not sex discrimination.\n\nA verdict in favour of the ban could further jeopardise trans children, Rick said, leaving them two options: pull their kids out of school and move out of state, or stay and cut back expenses to afford out-of-state healthcare.\n\n‘I have no idea how the court will rule,’ Rick said. ‘It would be a great thing if they ruled on behalf of the family with a transgender child.’\n\n The ‘Freedom to Be’ quilt laid out on the grass on the National Mall at the launch of World Pride last month (Picture: Getty Images)\n\nSean Madden, the 59-year-old independent-conservative father of a trans daughter in North Carolina, said he hopes the same.\n\nBorn and raised in New York City, his daughter, Allie, came out as trans when she was 16. ‘My wife and I had a very superficial understanding of what it meant to be trans, so we did what almost all parents would do under the circumstances – try and understand,’ he told Metro.\n\n‘It was clear she had been suffering and alone with this secret for some time.’\n\nTogether with his wife, Anne Madden, 60, the couple researched healthcare options for Allie, including a therapist. \n\n‘The number one objective for your child is to keep them happy and healthy,’ he said.\n\n US states where a law or policy banning gender-affirming care for minors has been passed (Picture: Metro)\n\n (From left to right) Anne Madden, Alison Madden and Sean Madden (Picture: Sean Madden)\n\nAllie, now 25, recently graduated from New York University and is an aspiring electronic dance music producer. \n\nSean knew he had to do something when he first heard of the Tennessee trans youth healthcare ban, thinking of what would have happened to Allie if she didn’t have access to the healthcare she needed. So he spoke with 28 families of trans young people for an amicus, a brief offering expertise, in the Skrmetti case.\n\n‘My view is that it’s a gross abuse of power to take away the decision away from parents and impose a one-size-fits-all remedy when there are no medically-approved alternatives,’ Sean said.\n\nThe Tennessee law bans medical providers from giving puberty blockers, which act like a pause button for puberty, to trans youth.\n\nBut doctors can write up prescriptions to cisgender youngsters with precocious puberty, which can spur puberty as early as infancy.\n\n‘I spoke to a family who had twins, one twin is trans and the other is cisgender with precocious puberty,’ said Sean. ‘The cisgender twin can be prescribed Lupron… the trans twin in Tennessee and other states like it can’t get the same safe and effective drug.’\n\n Rick and Ashton with Rachel Levine, the first openly trans federal official confirmed by the Senate, who served as the Assistant Secretary for Health (Picture: Rick Colby)\n\nSean, who works with the Gender Research Advisory Council & Education, pointed to how 40% of trans teens (about 118,300 people) live in a state that restricts their healthcare. \n\nMore could follow. According to the monitoring service TransLash, of the 701 proposed anti-trans bills sitting in state Houses and Senates today, 189 aim to restrict trans healthcare.\n\nHow many trans people live in Tennessee is unclear, but a 2022 survey found it is one of the top 10 states people are leaving because of its anti-trans laws, which include bans on updating gender markers on birth certificates and driving licences. \n\nOne of the families Sean spoke to, a single mum in Utah, drove over state lines to get puberty blockers for her child, only to be unable to afford them.\n\n‘So she procured them in Mexico instead,’ Sean said. ‘These families rise above incredible obstacles and do what they can to get care. It shouldn’t be that hard.\n\n‘It is not an overstatement to say that if this medically necessary care is taken away or unavailable, kids will die,’ Sean added. ‘It will fall on the most vulnerable families who can’t travel out of state. You’re going to have a two-tier health system.’\n\n Many families of trans youngsters have already fled the state (Picture: Middle East Images/AFP)\n\nSean said that one way legislators try to justify their bans is ‘dehumanising’ trans people by coughing up so much disinformation that the community no longer seems like ‘actual humans’.\n\nHe worries the Supreme Court may do the same, with the conservative majority justices appearing poised to uphold the ban. \n\nTo them, Sean has a simple question. \n\n‘Ask yourself, if you were in this position, you have an adolescent child with gender dysphoria, what do you do?’ he said.\n\n‘I think most parents, regardless of their feelings, understand they have to care for their child. That’s the job as a parent.’\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.","summary":"'If this medically necessary care is taken away or unavailable, kids will die.'","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/06/15/im-a-conservative-dad-voted-trump-anything-trans-child-23265409/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/SEC_254144351-e4e6.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 07:00:00","author":"Josh Milton","authors":["Josh Milton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":331556360,"title":"Minnesota manhunt underway for suspect in deadly shooting of Democratic state lawmakers","text":"MINNEAPOLIS, (Reuters) – Minnesota Police and the FBI kept up a massive manhunt last evening for a gunman posing as a police officer who killed a senior Democratic state assemblywoman and her husband in what Governor Tim Walz called a “politically motivated assassination.”\n\nThe suspect, identified as 57-year-old Vance Luther Boelter, also allegedly shot and wounded a second lawmaker and his spouse, according to law enforcement officials and the FBI.\n\nHe fled on foot after firing at police at the home of slain former Minnesota House speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said the suspect abandoned a vehicle that looked like a police SUV, in which officers found a “manifesto” and a target list of other politicians and institutions.\n\nBoelter should be considered armed and dangerous and is believed to still be in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans told a news briefing, adding that it was too soon to determine a motive.\n\nThe suspect had links to evangelical ministries and claimed to be a security expert with experience in the Gaza Strip and Africa, according to online postings and public records reviewed by Reuters. Boelter also described himself online as a former employee of food service companies and was appointed in 2016 by Walz’ predecessor to the advisory Governor’s Workforce Development Board, according to state records.\n\nDavid Carlson, 59, told Reuters that he has been sharing a house in Minneapolis with Boelter for a little more than a year and last saw him on Friday night. Then about 6 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Saturday, he received a text from Boelter.\n\n“He said that he might be dead soon,” said Carlson, who called police.\n\nThe list found in the vehicle abandoned by the suspect contained about 70 names, including abortion providers, and lawmakers in Minnesota and other states, CNN reported, citing law enforcement sources. Officials said the Hortmans and the other victims – state Senator John Hoffman and his wife – were on the list.\n\nABC News, also citing law enforcement officials, said the list included dozens of Minnesota Democrats including Walz, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, Senator Tina Smith and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.\n\nMelissa Hortman, a 55-year-old mother of two who had served 20 years in the Minnesota House of Representatives, was remembered by Walz as someone with “grace, compassion and tirelessness.”\n\nWalz, who was Kamala Harris’ Democratic vice presidential running mate in last year’s election, said the gunman went to the Hortmans’ residence after shooting the Hoffmans multiple times in their home in the nearby town of Champlin.\n\nThe Hoffmans underwent surgery, Walz said, adding that he was “cautiously optimistic” that they would survive “this assassination attempt.”\n\n“This was an act of targeted political violence,” he said. “Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don’t settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.”\n\nThe shootings prompted reactions of shock and horror from Republican and Democratic politicians across the country and calls for dialing back increasingly divisive political rhetoric.\n\nThe incident comes on the heels of a heated hearing in Congress on Thursday, in which Walz and two other Democratic governors defended their states’ policies to maintain sanctuary for undocumented immigrants, drawing attacks from Republicans who support Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\nThe Minnesota State Patrol chief, Colonel Christina Bogojevic, said police had found flyers in the suspect’s vehicle with “No Kings” printed on them but that he had no direct links to the thousands of nationwide “No Kings” protests on Saturday against President Donald Trump’s policies.\n\nThe protests were timed to counter Trump’s long-sought military parade in Washington. The organizing No Kings Coalition canceled all protests in Minnesota, citing a shelter-in-place order and the suspect’s at-large status.\n\nTrump said he was briefed on the “terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers.”\n\n“Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!” Trump said in a statement.\n\nPOLICE IMPERSONATOR\n\nHortman and her husband were shot dead in their home in Brooklyn Park, Walz said.

Silicon Valley. An agricultural sector that grows more than three-quarters of fruits and nuts in America. All contributed to April’s news that California had officially overtaken Japan to become the fourth biggest economy in the world, its GDP of $4.1tn trailing only the entirety of the US, China and Germany.\n\nBut two months later this superpower is locked in a bitter power struggle with Washington DC. Days of protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles prompted Donald Trump to deploy military forces against what he called “insurrectionists” despite strenuous objections from state and local leaders.\n\nThe US president even endorsed the arrest of California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who accused Trump of manufacturing a crisis, filed a lawsuit against the administration and warned in a televised address that America was on the brink of authoritarianism unless citizens take a stand.\n\nIt is a fight that Trump has been spoiling for. California has long occupied a special place in the imagination of his “Make America great again” (Maga) movement. Its name has become a cultural signifier for coastal elitism, illegal immigration and “wokeness” in Republican eyes. It is a $4tn enemy within.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles, city of immigrant protests: why it’s no surprise LA rose up against Trump\n\n“California, in a way, stands for the opposite of Trumpism,” said Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles. “It stands for tolerance. It stands for diversity, the word that’s now verboten in the administration. It stands for helping poor people and people who’ve been left out. And it stands for giving a fair hearing, unpopular as it may be, to people who applied for asylum.”\n\nImmigration is in California’s cultural DNA. Even former governor Ronald Reagan, a diehard conservative, championed America’s status as a nation of immigrants when he was US president. In 2018 California became the first “sanctuary state” in the nation when its legislature enacted a law limiting local and state officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.\n\nTrump has lost California in three consecutive elections, most recently against Vice-President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants to the Golden state. It was a leader of the “resistance” against Trump’s first-term agenda, filing more than a hundred lawsuits to challenge the administration’s policies on immigration, environmental regulations, healthcare and other issues.\n\nThe battle looks set to be even more intense second time around. Newsom secured $25m to fund legal fights and “Trump-proof” the state. California sued the administration 16 times in the first 100 days, nearly double the pace of Trump’s first term, over issues including birthright citizenship, healthcare, education, federal job cuts and tariffs.\n\nHostilities broke out during California’s devastating wildfires when Trump sought to blame Newsom and other officials and threatened to withhold federal aid unless the governor changed the state’s environmental policies.\n\nThe president has since repeatedly spun a yarn about how he sent Los Angeles critical water that its leaders failed to provide. “I invaded Los Angeles, and we opened up the water, and the water is now flowing down,” he boasted in March. Yet the 2bn-plus gallons of water that Trump ordered to be released from two dams in the Central valley agricultural hub did not actually go to Los Angeles.\n\nCalifornia’s leadership in climate action, including strict tailpipe emissions standards under the Clean Air Act, has also been a target. The president’s advisers proposed limiting the state’s authority to set its own emissions standards, a move that failed in his first term but could gain traction with a more Trump-aligned supreme court.\n\nThen, inevitably, came the showdown over immigration, a political gift for Trump as he sought to deflect attention from his feud with the tech billionaire Elon Musk and Republican divisions over his tax and spending bill.\n\nThe spark was aggressive raids by federal agents against immigrants in Los Angeles’ fashion district, in a Home Depot car park and several other locations. Protests started in downtown Los Angeles before spreading to Paramount and neighboring Compton.\n\nMost were peaceful but some demonstrators attempted to block border patrol vehicles by hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed teargas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls.\n\nAs images of blazing cars and masked protesters waving Mexican flags went viral in rightwing media, with an assist from the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller’s X social media account, Trump realised his opportunity to strike California had come.\n\nHe sent thousands of national guard troops and marines to Los Angeles, telling reporters: “You have violent people, and we’re not gonna let them get away with it.” It was an extraordinary breach of state sovereignty that Newsom said was unwarranted, politically motivated and likely to pour fuel on the fire.\n\nBut it was a familiar playbook for Trump, who revels in spectacle and has previously promoted a video of Venezuelan alleged gang members having their heads shaved or being manhandled by guards. The show of strength allowed him to highlight his core issues: immigration enforcement, “law and order” and a battle against a state that is the ultimate bastion of progressive values.\n\nShrum, who worked for Al Gore and John Kerry’s presidential campaigns and is director of the Center for the Political Future at USC Dornsife, said: “He likes to make an enemy of California. California can be his bete noire, an example of everything he claims is wrong. It can appeal to parts of his base that resent the so-called coastal elites that they claim have run the country up to now.”\n\nHe added: “The whole thing in LA is confined to about two square blocks; 99.99% of one of the world’s great cities is functioning in a very normal way. But Trump has been able to use this as a pretext to do what he’s wanted to do all along – and wanted to do in 2020 – which was call out the armed forces to suppress dissent. In the meantime he is enjoying the prospect of a fight with Gavin Newsom.”\n\nThere is personal animosity and political rivalry between Trump and Newsom, who is seen as a potential future presidential candidate. Trump has used derogatory language such as “Newscum” and even publicly backed his border czar Tom Homan’s idea of arresting Newsom for potentially interfering with federal immigration enforcement. He said: “I would do it if I were Tom. I think it’s great.”\n\nNewsom responded defiantly, “Come and get me, tough guy,” and wrote on X: “The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor. This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation – this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”\n\nNewsom and the state also pushed back against the federal intervention through legal means and public statements. California is suing the Trump administration over the troop deployment, arguing that it is illegal, immoral and unconstitutional. In televised remarks on Tuesday, Newsom said: “Democracy is under assault right before our eyes – the moment we’ve feared has arrived.”\n\nBut some argue that the governor is playing into Trump’s hands. Bill Whalen, a political consultant and speechwriter who worked for Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Republican governors of California, said: “You have Democratic leaders all insisting these are peaceful rallies and peaceful protest and then you see the visuals which show rocks and cinder blocks being thrown and cars on fire and people on motorcycles coming out of the smoke to wave Mexican flags. That’s not peace. That’s not a 60s love-in by any means.”\n\nWhalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University, added: “Elissa Slotkin, the senator from Michigan, made a comment about her party not too long ago.

Silicon Valley. An agricultural sector that grows more than three-quarters of fruits and nuts in America. All contributed to April’s news that California had officially overtaken Japan to become the fourth biggest economy in the world, its GDP of $4.1tn trailing only the entirety of the US, China and Germany.\n\nBut two months later this superpower is locked in a bitter power struggle with Washington DC. Days of protests over immigration raids in Los Angeles prompted Donald Trump to deploy military forces against what he called “insurrectionists” despite strenuous objections from state and local leaders.\n\nThe US president even endorsed the arrest of California’s governor, Gavin Newsom, who accused Trump of manufacturing a crisis, filed a lawsuit against the administration and warned in a televised address that America was on the brink of authoritarianism unless citizens take a stand.\n\nIt is a fight that Trump has been spoiling for. California has long occupied a special place in the imagination of his “Make America great again” (Maga) movement. Its name has become a cultural signifier for coastal elitism, illegal immigration and “wokeness” in Republican eyes. It is a $4tn enemy within.\n\n“California, in a way, stands for the opposite of Trumpism,” said Bob Shrum, a Democratic strategist based in Los Angeles. “It stands for tolerance. It stands for diversity, the word that’s now verboten in the administration. It stands for helping poor people and people who’ve been left out. And it stands for giving a fair hearing, unpopular as it may be, to people who applied for asylum.”\n\nImmigration is in California’s cultural DNA. Even former governor Ronald Reagan, a diehard conservative, championed America’s status as a nation of immigrants when he was US president. In 2018 California became the first “sanctuary state” in the nation when its legislature enacted a law limiting local and state officials from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.\n\nTrump has lost California in three consecutive elections, most recently against Vice-President Kamala Harris, a daughter of immigrants to the Golden state. It was a leader of the “resistance” against Trump’s first-term agenda, filing more than a hundred lawsuits to challenge the administration’s policies on immigration, environmental regulations, healthcare and other issues.\n\nThe battle looks set to be even more intense second time around. Newsom secured $25m to fund legal fights and “Trump-proof” the state. California sued the administration 16 times in the first 100 days, nearly double the pace of Trump’s first term, over issues including birthright citizenship, healthcare, education, federal job cuts and tariffs.\n\nHostilities broke out during California’s devastating wildfires when Trump sought to blame Newsom and other officials and threatened to withhold federal aid unless the governor changed the state’s environmental policies.\n\nThe president has since repeatedly spun a yarn about how he sent Los Angeles critical water that its leaders failed to provide. “I invaded Los Angeles, and we opened up the water, and the water is now flowing down,” he boasted in March. Yet the 2bn-plus gallons of water that Trump ordered to be released from two dams in the Central valley agricultural hub did not actually go to Los Angeles.\n\nCalifornia’s leadership in climate action, including strict tailpipe emissions standards under the Clean Air Act, has also been a target. The president’s advisers proposed limiting the state’s authority to set its own emissions standards, a move that failed in his first term but could gain traction with a more Trump-aligned supreme court.\n\nThen, inevitably, came the showdown over immigration, a political gift for Trump as he sought to deflect attention from his feud with the tech billionaire Elon Musk and Republican divisions over his tax and spending bill.\n\nThe spark was aggressive raids by federal agents against immigrants in Los Angeles’ fashion district, in a Home Depot car park and several other locations. Protests started in downtown Los Angeles before spreading to Paramount and neighboring Compton.\n\nMost were peaceful but some demonstrators attempted to block border patrol vehicles by hurling rocks and chunks of cement. In response, agents in riot gear unleashed teargas, flash-bang explosives and pepper balls.\n\nAs images of blazing cars and masked protesters waving Mexican flags went viral in rightwing media, with an assist from the White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller’s X social media account, Trump realised his opportunity to strike California had come.\n\nHe sent thousands of national guard troops and marines to Los Angeles, telling reporters: “You have violent people, and we’re not gonna let them get away with it.” It was an extraordinary breach of state sovereignty that Newsom said was unwarranted, politically motivated and likely to pour fuel on the fire.\n\nBut it was a familiar playbook for Trump, who revels in spectacle and has previously promoted a video of Venezuelan alleged gang members having their heads shaved or being manhandled by guards. The show of strength allowed him to highlight his core issues: immigration enforcement, “law and order” and a battle against a state that is the ultimate bastion of progressive values.\n\nShrum, who worked for Al Gore and John Kerry’s presidential campaigns and is director of the Center for the Political Future at USC Dornsife, said: “He likes to make an enemy of California. California can be his bete noire, an example of everything he claims is wrong. It can appeal to parts of his base that resent the so-called coastal elites that they claim have run the country up to now.”\n\nHe added: “The whole thing in LA is confined to about two square blocks; 99.99% of one of the world’s great cities is functioning in a very normal way. But Trump has been able to use this as a pretext to do what he’s wanted to do all along – and wanted to do in 2020 – which was call out the armed forces to suppress dissent. In the meantime he is enjoying the prospect of a fight with Gavin Newsom.”\n\nThere is personal animosity and political rivalry between Trump and Newsom, who is seen as a potential future presidential candidate. Trump has used derogatory language such as “Newscum” and even publicly backed his border czar Tom Homan’s idea of arresting Newsom for potentially interfering with federal immigration enforcement. He said: “I would do it if I were Tom. I think it’s great.”\n\nNewsom responded defiantly, “Come and get me, tough guy,” and wrote on X: “The President of the United States just called for the arrest of a sitting Governor. This is a day I hoped I would never see in America. I don’t care if you’re a Democrat or a Republican this is a line we cannot cross as a nation – this is an unmistakable step toward authoritarianism.”\n\nNewsom and the state also pushed back against the federal intervention through legal means and public statements. California is suing the Trump administration over the troop deployment, arguing that it is illegal, immoral and unconstitutional. In televised remarks on Tuesday, Newsom said: “Democracy is under assault right before our eyes – the moment we’ve feared has arrived.”\n\nBut some argue that the governor is playing into Trump’s hands. Bill Whalen, a political consultant and speechwriter who worked for Pete Wilson and Arnold Schwarzenegger, former Republican governors of California, said: “You have Democratic leaders all insisting these are peaceful rallies and peaceful protest and then you see the visuals which show rocks and cinder blocks being thrown and cars on fire and people on motorcycles coming out of the smoke to wave Mexican flags. That’s not peace. That’s not a 60s love-in by any means.”\n\nWhalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University, added: “Elissa Slotkin, the senator from Michigan, made a comment about her party not too long ago. She said the problem with the Democratic party is it’s perceived as weak and woke. That is what Trump feeds on: the perception of weakness and wokeism. Here in California Gavin Newsom, Mayor Karen Bass, California’s leaders writ large play into that perception.”\n\nThe duel has highlighted a shift from traditional conservative defences of states’ rights towards a more centralised approach under Trump, who has sought to expand executive power and enforce a rightwing agenda through federal coercion.\n\nThe Politico website has reported that the administration is considering cutting federal education funds to California.

Boelter also described himself online as a former employee of food service companies and was appointed in 2016 by Walz' predecessor to the advisory Governor's Workforce Development Board, according to state records.\n\nDavid Carlson, 59, told Reuters that he has been sharing a house in Minneapolis with Boelter for a little more than a year and last saw him on Friday night. Then about 6 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Saturday, he received a text from Boelter.\n\n\"He said that he might be dead soon,\" said Carlson, who called police.\n\nThe list found in the vehicle abandoned by the suspect contained about 70 names, including abortion providers, and lawmakers in Minnesota and other states, CNN reported, citing law enforcement sources. Officials said the Hortmans and the other victims - state Senator John Hoffman and his wife - were on the list.\n\nABC News, also citing law enforcement officials, said the list included dozens of Minnesota Democrats including Walz, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, Senator Tina Smith and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison.\n\nPOLITICAL MOTIVATION?\n\nMelissa Hortman, a 55-year-old mother of two who had served 20 years in the Minnesota House of Representatives, was remembered by Walz as someone with \"grace, compassion and tirelessness.\"\n\nWalz, who was Kamala Harris' Democratic vice presidential running mate in last year's election, said the gunman went to the Hortmans' residence after shooting the Hoffmans multiple times in their home in the nearby town of Champlin.\n\nThe Hoffmans underwent surgery, Walz said, adding that he was \"cautiously optimistic\" that they would survive \"this assassination attempt.\"\n\n\"This was an act of targeted political violence,\" he said. \"Peaceful discourse is the foundation of our democracy. We don't settle our differences with violence or at gunpoint.\"\n\nThe shootings prompted reactions of shock and horror from Republican and Democratic politicians across the country and calls for dialing back increasingly divisive political rhetoric.\n\nThe incident comes on the heels of a heated hearing in Congress on Thursday, in which Walz and two other Democratic governors defended their states' policies to maintain sanctuary for undocumented immigrants, drawing attacks from Republicans who support Trump's aggressive immigration crackdown.\n\nThe Minnesota State Patrol chief, Colonel Christina Bogojevic, said police had found flyers in the suspect's vehicle with \"No Kings\" printed on them but that he had no direct links to the thousands of nationwide \"No Kings\" protests on Saturday against President Donald Trump's policies.\n\nThe protests were timed to counter Trump's long-sought military parade in Washington. The organizing No Kings Coalition canceled all protests in Minnesota, citing a shelter-in-place order and the suspect's at-large status.\n\nTrump said he was briefed on the \"terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers.\"\n\n\"Such horrific violence will not be tolerated in the United States of America. God Bless the great people of Minnesota, a truly great place!\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nPOLICE IMPERSONATOR\n\nHortman and her husband were shot dead in their home in Brooklyn Park, Walz said. The Minneapolis suburb is in the northern part of Hennepin County, a Democratic stronghold in a state where Republicans have made gains in recent years.\n\nBefore Hortman's killing, the Minnesota House of Representatives she served in was evenly split 67-67 between Democrats and Republicans.\n\nThe FBI released photos of Boelter wearing a rubber mask in a police-like uniform and offered a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to his arrest and conviction.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said the gunman attacked the Hoffmans around 2 a.m. CDT (0700 GMT), then drove about 5 miles (8 km) to the Hortmans' residence.\n\nBrooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley said a \"very intuitive\" police sergeant who responded to the Hoffman attack asked colleagues to \"proactively\" check the Hortmans' home.\n\nThe two officers arriving at the Hortmans' residence saw a police-like vehicle with lights on and were immediately fired upon by the suspect. Bruley said they returned fire, but the suspect ran.\n\nPOLITICAL VIOLENCE SURGE\n\nThe pre-dawn Minnesota killings come amid a surge in U.S. political attacks in recent years, underscoring the dark side of the nation's deepening political divisions.\n\nThese include the attempted 2020 kidnapping of Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, and a man who broke into Democratic Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s residence in April and set it on fire.\n\nIn July last year, then-candidate Trump escaped an assassination attempt by a gunman while speaking at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania.\n\nTrump has faced criticism from some opponents over his handling of incidents involving political violence.\n\nIn one of his first moves in office earlier this year, Trump pardoned nearly everyone criminally charged with participating in the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\n© Thomson Reuters 2025.","summary":"Minnesota Police and the FBI kept up a massive manhunt on Saturday evening for a gunman posing as a police officer who killed a senior Democratic state assemblywoman…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/minnesota-manhunt-underway-for-suspect-in-deadly-shooting-of-democratic-state-lawmakers","image":"https://media.japantoday.com/img/store/21/bf/68adc5a891c334ebc86ac0af94adcb00fac4/tag-reuters/_w1700.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-15 01:54:34","author":"Japan Today Editor,Tom Polansek","authors":["Japan Today Editor","Tom Polansek"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":331482114,"title":"Elon Musk Supports Prominent Democrat Criticizing His Party for Chaos During LA ICE Protests","text":"Elon Musk bolstered Democratic Sen. John Fetterman after he slammed his own party for backing – or at least refusing to call out – the violent and destructive LA rioters.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Senator has more recently broken with Democrats on some major hot button issues – including condemning the swath of anti-ICE protesters who last week began rioting in the streets while waving Mexican flags, raiding stores and clashing with law enforcement officers in southern California.\n\nFetterman demanded his caucus colleagues join him in denouncing rioters who are wreaking havoc on downtown Los Angeles.\n\n‘I unapologetically stand for free speech, peaceful demonstrations, and immigration—but this is not that,’ Fetterman wrote on X with an image of cars on fire with a masked rioter waving a Mexican flag.\n\nHe continued: ‘This is anarchy and true chaos. My party loses the moral high ground when we refuse to condemn setting cars on fire, destroying buildings, and assaulting law enforcement.’\n\nMusk replied to Fetterman’s post with an emoji of an American flag.\n\nEarlier this month, Musk and President Donald Trump got into a very public spat after the billionaire broke with his former best friend over his massive spending proposal – the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.\n\nThis caused a civil war within the MAGAverse.\n\nAnd now, the billionaire CEO is using his social media platform to side with a Democratic Senator.\n\nBut Musk wasn’t the only one who praised and amplified Fetterman’s condemnation of his own party.\n\nOhio gubernatorial candidate and former 2024 presidential hopeful Vivek Ramaswamy reposted Fetterman and noted on X: ‘It’s hard to preach hard truths to your own side. I respect this.’\n\nDeputy White House chief of staff Taylor Budowich called Fetterman’s post a ‘wake up call for many Democrats.’\n\n‘[T]here is no room for you in the party of Gavin Newsom and Kamala Harris,’ he continued. ‘Their self-obsessed pursuits of power are blind to you and your concerns. They defend chaos, reject biology, and are unbothered by the invasion of our nation.’\n\nNotorious pro-Second Amendment activist Dana Loesch posted: ‘Well said, Senator.’\n\nFetterman was the first, and so far only, Democratic senator to condemn the riots.\n\nThough Sen.

During the 2024 election cycle, he argued that the “whole country will end up being like Detroit” if Vice President Kamala Harris won. \n\n“I think Detroit and some of our areas makes us a developing nation,” Trump said.\n\nHe also said that Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, is “ravaged by bloodshed and crime” and described Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as “horrible” right before the city hosted the 2024 Republican National Convention. \n\nAnd when Trump first ran for president in 2016, he blatantly lied by insisting that “inner city crime is reaching record levels.”\n\nSenior Trump administration officials have echoed this anti-city rhetoric. MTV reality show contestant-turned-Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has expressed fear of the New York City Subway system, which is used every day by millions of city-dwelling Americans without incident.\n\nSimilarly, when Homeland Security Kristi Noem isn’t busy cosplaying in anti-immigration photo shoots, she’s expressing her disdain for U.S. cities like Los Angeles, which she’s referred to as a “city of criminals.”\n\nThe anti-city rhetoric goes back decades within the Republican Party. President Ronald Reagan frequently invoked the myth of the “welfare queen,” basing his racist rant—which was later significantly debunked—on the purported exploits of a Black woman from Chicago, one of the right’s favorite targets.\n\nReagan was also criticized during his presidency by Chicago’s Mayor Harold Washington for having “declared war” on cities by slashing federal funding for services vital to those regions of the country.\n\nWhy are Republicans like this?\n\nU.S. cities are a success story.\n\nThey’re racially diverse melting pots that have become meccas for art, culture, and commerce that have spread U.S. values and influence around the world. Even in extremely remote areas, people know about life in places like New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Miami, and beyond.\n\nOn paper, Republicans should like American cities—they are economic powerhouses, pumping billions every year into the economy and powering global businesses. This provides revenues that significantly help to subsidize life in more rural, Republican-leaning areas.\n\nFor Republicans to praise cities—which are the most Democratic areas in the United States, even in red states like Texas— they would have to acknowledge the success of liberal approaches to cultural integration and business.\n\nInstead, the party and its leaders would rather go on the attack.\n\nRepublicans love city amenities\n\nThe ire from the GOP is especially strange given its current leadership. Trump is not a product of rural America or even the red part of a blue state. He is a consummate New Yorker who built a name for himself with lurid headlines on the front pages of New York City tabloids.\n\nIn a similar fashion, the leading conservative propaganda outlet, Fox News, is not headquartered in a rustic small town in “flyover” country. No, Fox News headquarters are situated in the heart of Manhattan. \n\nIronically, even as they rail against blue state values, Fox News hosts, reporters, anchors, and pundits are enjoying the benefits of city life at the highest end of the economic spectrum.\n\nAttacking cities is a useful, coded way for Republicans to demonize areas with significant minority communities. That way, they can pull attention away from how right-wing policies hurt red states and instead focus on made-up boogeymen.\n\nThe GOP has found a way to have its cake and eat it, too. But Republicans’ cynicism is now raising temperatures to a dangerous level that could lead to an even more dangerous situation—for cities, suburbs, rural areas, and everything in between.","summary":"In the last week, President Donald Trump has authorized and promoted a military occupation of one of the largest cities in the world, Los Angeles, in an attempt to squash protests against his unconstitutional mass deportations.\n\n\n\nThe action against Los Angeles reflects longstanding conservative disdain for U.S. cities, despite their pivotal role in the nation’s cultural and economic development.\n\n\n\nThe right really hates cities\n\nSince becoming a political figure, Trump has had few positive things to say about cities.

First, he shot State Senator John Hoffman and his wife, who were seriously wounded. Law-enforcement officials believe the same gunman then shot Melissa Hortman, who served as Minnesota’s speaker of the House from 2019 to 2024. She was killed, along with her husband, Mark.\n\nIn September 2023, shortly after Donald Trump yet again encouraged direct political violence against his opponents, I wrote this: “As a political scientist who studies political violence across the globe, I would chalk up the lack of high-profile assassinations in the United States during the Trump and post-Trump era to dumb luck … Eventually, all luck runs out.”\n\nThat luck has now run out, in an idyllic Minneapolis suburb.\n\nAlthough details are still emerging, law-enforcement officials are searching for a former appointee of Democratic Governor Tim Walz in connection with the killings, which Walz called “politically motivated.” The gunman reportedly had a manifesto and a list of targets that included the names of other Minnesota politicians as well as abortion providers in the state. Law-enforcement authorities intercepted but were not able to arrest the alleged shooter shortly after Hortman was assassinated. Had they not, it’s possible that he would have made his way to the homes of other Minnesota officials, trying to murder them too.\n\nPolitical violence—and assassinations in particular—are notoriously difficult to predict, precisely because the violence is often carried out by “lone wolf” attackers. Just one deranged zealot is sufficient to carry out an act of consequential violence. In a country of 340 million people and even more guns, there will always be a small pool of potential killers eager to wreak havoc on the political system.\n\nThat’s why researchers who study political violence, including myself, try to understand what elevates or reduces the risk of violence, even if it can never be fully eradicated. In a context such as the United States, three key factors stand out: easy access to deadly weapons, intense polarization that paints political opponents as treasonous enemies rather than disagreeing compatriots, and incitements to political violence from high-profile public figures. When you combine those three social toxins, the likelihood of political violence increases, even as it remains impossible to predict who will be targeted or when attacks might be carried out.\n\nAgain, law-enforcement officials still don’t know the attacker’s precise motivations, and trying to draw conclusions from any single act of political violence is foolish. Because they are rare, randomness plays a role in these instances, and many perpetrators are mentally unwell. But consider this comparison. Although we can’t say that climate change caused a specific hurricane, we know that climate change produces stronger hurricanes. Similarly, we may not be able to draw a direct link from rhetoric to a specific act of violence, but we do know that incitements to violence make killings more likely.\n\nThe United States has repeatedly refused to do anything about easy access to deadly weapons, despite having, by far, the highest rate of mass killings among developed democracies. As a result, the only feasible levers are reducing polarization and stopping high-profile incitements to commit violence. Instead, during the Trump era, polarization has sharply increased. And over the past decade, Trump himself has been the most dangerous political actor in terms of routinely inciting violence against his opponents, including against specific politicians who could become assassination targets.\n\nSuch incitements matter. When a person with a massive public platform spreads information that encourages violence, attacks become more likely.\n\nFrom the beginning of his first campaign for president, Trump encouraged supporters to beat up hecklers at his rallies, saying he’d cover their legal bills if they “knock the crap” out of them. He floated the ideas of shooting looters, shooting shoplifters, and shooting migrants crossing the border. Trump also targeted the press, sharing a variety of violent memes involving specific outlets. He endorsed Greg Gianforte, now the governor of Montana, specifically because he violently attacked a reporter. (“Any guy that can do a body slam, he is my type,” Trump said, to cheers.) And, at the end of his first term, Trump’s speech on the National Mall on January 6 doused an already incendiary environment, culminating in a violent attack on the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nTrump’s rhetorical incitements to violence extend to politicians too. He has called his political opponents “human scum.” Even more worrying are Trump’s endorsements of violence against specific Democrats. In 2016, he suggested that maybe there was something that “Second Amendment people” could do to deal with Hillary Clinton. In October 2022, when a QAnon disciple who had peddled Trump’s lies about the 2020 election attempted to assassinate then–Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi—and fractured the skull of her husband, Paul, with a hammer—Trump made light of the incident. (His son Donald Trump Jr. posted a photo on Instagram of a hammer and a pair of underwear like the ones Paul Pelosi had been wearing during the attempted murder, with the caption: “Got my Paul Pelosi Halloween costume ready.”) Less than a year later, Trump openly mused that Mark Milley, then the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, should be killed.\n\nWhen such language becomes normalized, deranged individuals may interpret rhetoric as marching orders. In 2018, Cesar Sayoc, a die-hard Trump supporter, mailed 16 pipe bombs to people who frequently appeared as targets in Trump’s tweets. (Nobody died, but only because Sayoc wasn’t skilled at making bombs.) In 2020, Trump tweeted that people should “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” in response to its COVID policies. Thirteen days later, armed protesters entered the state capitol building. A right-wing plot to kidnap the governor, Gretchen Whitmer, was narrowly foiled months later.\n\nIt also matters that Trump is one of the biggest vectors for spreading conspiracy theories and misinformation in the United States. When a major political figure disseminates lies about shadowy plots and treasonous acts carried out by the “human scum” on the other side of the aisle, that can increase the likelihood of violence. (Several followers of QAnon, which Trump has repeatedly amplified himself, have carried out political violence based on the conspiracy theory.)\n\nTrump often makes a brief show of condemning political violence—as he has with the killings in Minnesota. While trying to play both the arsonist and the firefighter on social media, his actions in power make clear where his true loyalties lie, sending much stronger signals. One of his first official acts at the start of his second term was to pardon or grant clemency to people convicted for their involvement in the January 6 riots, including those who had violently attacked police officers and were targeting lawmakers. In recent weeks, Trump has floated the possibility of pardoning the far-right zealots who sought to kidnap Governor Whitmer in Michigan. The message is unmistakable: Use violence against my political opponents and there may be a pardon waiting. Joe Biden abused his pardon power to protect his son from tax-evasion charges. Donald Trump abused his pardon power to condone those who attacked cops and hoped to murder politicians. Both abuses were bad. But they are not the same.\n\nTrump, more than anyone, should be aware of the risks of political violence. After all, he narrowly escaped an assassin’s bullet last summer. He would be dead but for a gust of wind or a slightly different tilt of his head. But when that assassination attempt happened, Biden didn’t mock it; Kamala Harris didn’t float the idea of pardoning the assassin; and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries hadn’t previously mused that Trump should be executed, or that he was human scum, or that Jeffries would pay the bills of people who used violence against Republicans.\n\nNeither party has a monopoly on the risks of political violence. Democrats and Republicans in public office are targets who face credible threats in a hyper-polarized political climate. Likewise, supporters of Democrats and supporters of Republicans are both capable of carrying out political violence. (There have also been a small number of statements by Democrats that could be interpreted as incitements to violence, including some by Representatives Maxine Waters of California and Dan Goldman of New York. Goldman apologized for his phrasing the following day.)\n\nThe difference is that only one party is led by someone who uses his megaphone to routinely normalize and absolve acts of political violence. There is overwhelming evidence of this asymmetric rhetoric between those in party leadership.\n\nThe United States is a fraying society, torn apart by polarization, intense disagreement, and ratcheting extremism. Cheap weapons of mass murder are readily available. And into that tinderbox, Trump adds incendiary rhetoric. We don’t know when or where the deadly conflagration will strike next, but more flames will no doubt come. We may still be shocked by tragic acts of political violence like the assassination in Minnesota, but we can no longer feign surprise.","summary":"The United States is a fraying society, torn apart by polarization, intense disagreement, and ratcheting extremism.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/06/in-minnesota-americas-luck-ran-out/683194/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/wBTSj_VkqVyY8e8I9Ivg_J2OsNk=/0x64:2999x1626/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/06/2025_06_MinnesotaShooting/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 22:13:00","author":"Brian Klaas","authors":["Brian Klaas"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":331464762,"title":"‘Assassination’: US pol, husband shot dead","text":"Democratic state representative Melissa Hortman — the former House Speaker — and her husband, Mark, were gunned down in their Brooklyn Park home in the northern US state, shortly after 2am on Saturday local time (4pm AET), police said.\n\nThe pair was killed after the gunman targeted Senator John Hoffman and his wife, Yvette, in their Champlin home roughly 8kms away.\n\nThe Hoffmans were rushed into surgery and are in stable condition, officials said at a news conference.\n\nThe FBI announced it is offering a reward of up to $US50,000 ($A77,000) for information “leading to the arrest and conviction” of suspect Vance Luther Boelter, 57.\n\nA law enforcement official told CNN the suspected gunmen had a hit list with nearly 70 names in his car. He is still at large.\n\nAuthorities do not know how many people are involved.\n\nMinnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Superintendent Drew Evans said: “We still don’t know if additional people are involved, but this individual is the one that we’re looking as a person of interest right now, but there may be other people with him.”\n\nBoelter is a former appointee of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz.\n\nMr Walz, who was Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 federal election, described the shootings as “an unspeakable tragedy,” and said the incident “appears to be a politically motivated assassination”.\n\nBoelter allegedly posed as a police officer when he shot Senator John Hoffman and his wife in their Champlin home early Saturday local time, leaving them seriously injured before moving on to the Hortmans’ house — where he is believed to have murdered her and her husband, sources told The NY Post.\n\nBoelter was appointed by Walz in 2019 to serve a four-year stint on the Governor’s Workforce Development Board, documents show.\n\nHe previously served on the Governor’s Workforce Development Council in 2016 under then Governor Mark Dayton.\n\nThe suspect reportedly had flyers with the words “No Kings” in his car, a reference to Saturday’s planned protests against the Trump Administration, as well as a “manifesto” and a list of other politicians’ names, said police, who briefly cornered the shooter at the Hortmans’ home before the suspect fled.\n\nThe anti-Trump rally in Minneapolis — part of the national wave of “No Kings” protests planned for Saturday — has since been cancelled after police issued a shelter-in-place order in response to the shootings.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and US Attorney-General Pam Bondi decried what they called “horrific violence” and said perpetrators would be prosecuted to “the fullest extent of the law”. \n\nThe shootings came at a moment of deep political divisions in the US, as thousands prepared to take to the streets in protest at the policies of Mr Trump.\n\nThe Republican president has drawn criticism from Democrats over his harsh deportation policy, his assault on universities and the media and a perceived flouting of limits on executive power as he pushes his agenda.\n\n“At this precipice moment we’re on, this tragic act here in Minnesota should serve as a reminder to all of us,” Mr Walz said.\n\n“The democracy and the debates in the halls of Congress, in state houses, in school boards, is a way to settle our differences peacefully and move society to a better place.”\n\nMatt Oleg, a relative of the Hoffmans, told KARE 11 that “a bullet just very nearly missed Senator Hoffman’s heart, that his wife Yvette is in better condition, she had no organs pierced, and that she saved the couple’s daughter’s life.”\n\n“The daughter Hope, who I believe is in her mid-twenties, was at home with her parents, and Yvette threw herself on top of her daughter,” Mr Lagoe continued, recalling the information shared with him by Oleg. He added that Hope “was not hit” by gunfire.\n\nMr Oleg said that John and Yvette Hoffman “are both out of surgery, they’re stable,” and “minutes ago had been trying to bring the senator out from under anaesthesia.”\n\nSuspect on-the-run\n\nThe suspect is still on the run, despite making contact with police in the aftermath of the Hortman double homicide, according to Brooklyn Park Police Chief Mark Bruley.\n\nOfficers dispatched to the Hortmans’ home as other units investigated the Hoffman shooting discovered a car outfitted with flashing lights to look like an SUV squad car.\n\n“When they arrived at Melissa’s house, they noticed that there was a police vehicle in the driveway with the emergency lights on and what appeared to be a police officer at the door coming out of the house,” Mr Bruley said, adding that the suspect was wearing a vest, a badge and other equipment, such as a Taser, “very similar to mine.”\n\n“When our officers confronted him, the individual immediately fired upon the officers, who exchanged gunfire, and the suspect retreated back into the home,” he continued.\n\n“It was not a real police officer. This is someone that clearly had been impersonating a police officer who uses the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home.”\n\nGunfire was exchanged, but the suspect escaped on foot.\n\nMark Hortman was alive when Brooklyn Park police entered the home, but he died as they attempted to deliver lifesaving measures.\n\nMelissa Hortman was declared dead at the scene.\n\nAs the mayhem unfolded, first responders rushed the Hoffmans to a nearby hospital.\n\nThe couple had each been pumped with multiple bullets, but survived the attack.\n\nCops initially ordered a shelter-in-place for the 4km radius surrounding the Edinburgh Golf Course near the Hortman home, which was lifted Saturday afternoon.\n\n“Police are looking for a suspect in multiple targeted shootings who is armed and dangerous,” Brooklyn Park Police said in an emergency alert sent to residents at 5:30am.\n\n“Suspect is white male, brown hair, wearing black body armour over blue shirt and blue pants and may misrepresent himself as law enforcement.”\n\nThey city later said they had reason to believe the suspect was no longer in the area.","summary":"Two US politicians and their spouses have been gunned down in a “politically motivated attack” at their homes by a shooter who posed as a cop.","url":"https://www.news.com.au/world/north-america/us-politics/us-politician-and-husband-killed-others-injured-after-madman-posing-as-cop-shoots-them/news-story/0c5f02740233a7d88307522189896ba9?from=rss-basic","image":"https://content.api.news/v3/images/bin/f9b428fa215efaf2355c62a6bae3b622","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 21:35:10","author":"Chantelle Francis","authors":["Chantelle Francis"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":331459540,"title":"CBS News hammered on social media for promoting 'No Kings Day' anti-Trump protest merchandise","text":"CBS News is currently facing backlash on social media after they posted what appeared to be an advertisement for \"No Kings Day\" protest merchandise to X on Friday, with users slamming the outlet for pushing the anti-Trump goods on the eve of a large-scale political protest.

The two events are culminating in the “Grand Military Parade” in Washington, D.C., featuring more than 6,700 soldiers and dozens of armored vehicles parading through the city.\n\nOpponents of the parade — the nation’s first since 1991’s National Victory Celebration, which was timed to welcome returning veterans of the 100- day Persian Gulf War — say it is a vanity project of a nascent dictator.\n\n“This administration is sending National Guard troops and active duty military against American citizens protesting this administration’s illegal and unconstitutional actions,” said Richard Cannon, an organizer with 50501 Escondido. “This is exactly the type of tyrannical behavior that our founding fathers feared, one that many thought “could never happen in this country.”\n\nThe group 50501 is a national organization that stands for 50 protests, 50 states, one movement.\n\nTwo major rallies for No Kings Day will kick off at 10 a.m. in Downtown San Diego, one at Civic Center Plaza, 1200 Third Ave., the other at Waterfront Park, 1600 Pacific Highway. Both will conclude at Waterfront Park.\n\nOrganizers encourage protesters to carry signs and make their voices heard, but not to engage in violent confrontation with supporters of the president and law enforcement.\n\n“A core principle behind all No Kings events is a commitment to nonviolent action,” a statement from No Kings organizers read. “We expect all participants to seek to de-escalate any potential confrontation with those who disagree with our values.”\n\nTrained peace-keepers in yellow vests will be scattered throughout the protests. Participants can seek them out with concerns.\n\nAn April 5 protest, “Hands Off Our Rights,” drew thousands to Waterfront Park without violence.\n\n“This is not a political issue, this is about real people and the real impact that these policies are having on them,” Rep. Sara Jacobs, D-San Diego, said of the April rally. “This kind of mass mobilization that we’re seeing here today of every day people — I don’t even know if all of these people voted for Kamala Harris, or voted for me — but showing that these policies have real impacts on real people and continuing to speak up and making our voices heard is the most important thing we can be doing right now.”\n\nThe military parade — which is subject to cancellation due to possible thunderstorms Saturday — will feature 28 M1 Abrams tanks, 28 Bradley fighting vehicles and Stryker armored vehicles, four Paladin howitzers, towed artillery, and multiple infantry squad vehicles. Army officials estimate the parade will cost taxpayers between $25 million and $45 million. Metal plates will be laid down on the street to prevent damage from the 68-ton machines, an army statement reads.\n\n“For two and a half centuries the men and women of America’s army have dominated our enemies and protected our freedom at home,” Trump said. “This parade salutes our soldiers’ remarkable strength and unbeatable spirit. You won’t want to miss it. Thundering tanks and breathtaking flyovers will roar through our capital city.”\n\nBut opponents disagree.\n\n“This is the kind of vanity parade we would expect to see in Russia or North Korea, not in a democracy,” said Allison Gill, podcaster of the Mueller She Wrote podcast, who will speak at the San Diego rallies.\n\nThe timing of the parade seems auspicious, as the Trump administration has recently ramped up Immigration and Customs Enforcement actions throughout the country, but notably in San Diego and Los Angeles, leading to ongoing civil unrest.\n\n“American immigrants built this country. From railroads, to farms, from factory workers, to building the homes we live in, they’ve been the backbone of the working class,” said Robin, an organizer with Indivisible North County San Diego. “So, we march on June 14 to remind the leaders of our country — there are no kings in the USA and immigrants will always be a part of this diverse nation.”\n\nTwo protests groups have merged in front of the county building at Waterfront Park to an estimated 20,000 demonstrators, with some traffic control along Harbor Drive while rolling road closures were put in place as the group moves, according to the San Diego Police Department.\n\n“No issues or arrests, everyone is being peaceful, and no enforcement action has been taken, but we are prepared if any crime occurs,” Officer Anthony Carrasco told City News Service. “We are very pleased about how things are going so far.”\n\nBeyond the two large rallies and marches in Downtown San Diego, other events will occur throughout the county:\n\n— Carlsbad, 10 a.m., Carlsbad Boulevard and Pine Avenue;\n\n— Del Mar, 10 a.m., Intersection of Del Mar Heights and Carmel Country roads;\n\n— Chula Vista, 10 a.m., Birch Road and Millenia Avenue;\n\n— Escondido, 10 a.m., Grape Day Park, 321 N Broadway;\n\n— El Cajon, 10 a.m., Magnolia Avenue and Fletcher Parkway;\n\n— Mira Mesa, 11 a.m., 10782 Westview Parkway;\n\n— Rancho Bernardo, 11 a.m., Bernardo Center Drive and Rancho Bernardo Road;\n\n— A kid-friendly rally at 11:15 a.m. at Civita Park in San Diego, 7897 Altana Way;\n\n— Ramona, 3:30 p.m., 1000 Main St.; and\n\n— San Marcos, 4:15 p.m., corner of Grand and West San Marcos Boulevard.\n\n“I am protesting because I am scared about what’s happening in our country,” said Michele Cyr, organizer of the Carlsbad protest. “It’s not a democracy anymore when workers are afraid to go to work, have no job to go to anymore, and our civil liberties are under attack.”\n\nFaith leaders gathered Friday to encourage nonviolent protest.\n\n“People are concerned about immigration in this country and rightfully so,” said Rev. Shane Harris, founder of People’s Association of Justice Advocates. “We believe that people should have the right to express their first amendment perspective but they must do so without violence and in peace, and that’s the message we want to get out to folks.\n\n“The traditions of both Cesar Chavez and Dr. Martin Luther King taught us that non violent movements eventually bring the country together. We don’t want folks to be arrested and prosecuted for violent actions, but instead we want people to express themselves in the streets in a peaceful and anti- violent way. Anarchists are hijackers of a movement and we should all call them out as such.”\n\n“Trump and U.S. Homeland Security officials have defended the immigration raids. The president won election in 2016 and 2024 on a platform of securing the southern border and deporting those in the United States illegally, and officials have said many of those targeted in the raids have long criminal histories.\n\n“The Biden Administration and Governor Newscum flooded America with 21 Million Illegal Aliens, destroying Schools, Hospitals and Communities, and consuming untold Billions of Dollars in Free Welfare. All of them have to go home, as do countless other Illegals and Criminals, who will turn us into a bankrupt Third World Nation,” Trump posted Friday on Truth Social.\n\n“America was invaded and occupied. I am reversing the Invasion. It’s called Remigration. Our courageous ICE Officers, who are daily being subjected to doxxing and murder threats, are HEROES. We will always have their back as they carry out this noble mission. America will be for Americans again!”\n\n— City News Service","summary":"Tens of thousands of San Diego County residents took to the streets Saturday for \"No Kings\" Day, a nationwide protest against the policies of President Donald Trump coinciding with a military parade in the nation's capital.","url":"https://timesofsandiego.com/politics/2025/06/14/estimated-20000-demonstrators-gather-for-no-kings-protests-in-downtown-sd/","image":"https://timesofsandiego.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/8B7A6127-scaled.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 18:41:39","author":"City News Service","authors":["City News Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.211},{"id":331429966,"title":"Democratic politician assassinated, another wounded in targeted overnight shootings","text":"Brooklyn Park police chief Mark Bruley said investigators found a “manifesto” in a vehicle used by the suspect that “identified many lawmakers and other officials”.

President Donald Trump, in the opinion of most Americans, is doin’ pretty well.\n\nHis job approval, which jutted downward after he announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs on April 2, has recovered and hovers just below 50%. That’s just about the level of Barack Obama’s and George W. Bush’s approval at this point in their second terms and above his own approval at any point in his first term.\n\nMany continue to regard some top appointments as eccentric. His style of discourse, OFTEN IN ALL CAPS, is eccentric by any past presidential standard. But in a political system that remains democratic and is increasingly demotic, that which sounds coarse to you (and me) is apparently acceptable to most people.\n\nAs for his, um, unusual appointments, they may make sense for a president who is less interested in fine-tuning organizations than in affecting the behaviors of mass publics.\n\nCandidate Trump in 2024 promised that he would eliminate shortfalls in military recruitment, which he attributed to the Joe Biden Pentagon’s “woke” policies. He pointed out accurately that the Army and Navy fell short of recruitment goals by as much as 25% in fiscal years 2022 and 2023.\n\nHe named Fox News host and military veteran Pete Hegseth as defense secretary, saying he’d promote a warfighting ethos that would attract un-woke young men and women to join up. The Army raised its recruiting goal from 55,000 to 61,000 and reached it in May, four months early.\n\nMaybe that’s a coincidence or a response to other factors. But it looks like Trump’s rhetoric made a big difference.\n\nOr look at trade. Trump has made no secret of his love for tariffs and his desire to reduce trade with China. This week, The Wall Street Journal reported that China’s exports to the U.S. in May were the lowest since COVID-19-wracked February 2020. It looks like thousands of American and Chinese market participants have made new decisions in response to Trump’s rhetoric.\n\nMeanwhile, the May job numbers in the U.S. increased by a more-than-expected 139,000, despite a 60,000 reduction in federal jobs since January. And despite a drop of foreign-born workers in the labor market estimated between 773,000 and 1 million since March.\n\nThree-quarters of a million to a million—those numbers dwarf the number of annual deportations from the interior of the U.S. as compiled by my Washington Examiner colleague Conn Carroll.\n\nThose range from 65,000 in the last year of the Obama administration and from 28,000 to 47,000 in the four Biden years. They were higher—81,000 to 95,000—in the first three years of Trump I and then fell to 62,000 in COVID-19 year 2020.\n\nThese numbers put in perspective the drama that has been playing out in Los Angeles this past week. The Trump administration cannot expect that it can, logistically, remove all the untold millions of illegal immigrants that whoever was running the Biden administration (no one, including the authors of “Original Sin,” has disclosed just who that was) allowed into the U.S. But splashy raids and deportations can get hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of illegal immigrants thinking about what Mitt Romney in 2012 called “self-deportation.”\n\nWhich is probably happening thanks to what has been happening in Los Angeles these past five days. Demonstrations against Immigration and Customs Enforcement deportation activity resulted in the arrest of the head of the Service Employees International Union.\n\nWhen “sanctuary city” Mayor Karen Bass and Gov. Gavin Newsom, D-Calif., let the rioting go on, Trump nationalized the California National Guard and dispatched Marines.\n\nHe plainly had the authority to do so when federal law enforcement is blocked, and as my Washington Examiner colleague Byron York recounts. And the Supreme Court in 2012 made it clear that federal immigration law prevails over countervailing state law.\n\nThere’s no question whose side the public is on. A pre-riot CBS poll showed 54% approving of Trump’s deportation program, and two polls taken this week showed approval: Insider Advantage by 59% to 39%, and the Napolitan News poll by 58% to 36%.\n\nAfter eight years of stark contrast between Trump and Democrats’ policies, as CNN poll analyst Harry Enten points out, most voters give Trump high marks and “believe that Democrats don’t have a clue on the issue of immigration.”\n\nSimilarly, voters who remember Democrats’ insistence and journalists’ assurances that Joe Biden was fully functional are skeptical that the L.A. rioters were “overwhelmingly peaceful” (Kamala Harris) or “largely peaceful” (The New York Times).\n\nThere’s ample historic precedent for Trump’s action as well. Dwight Eisenhower in 1957 and Lyndon Johnson in 1965 sent in federal troops to uphold federal law over the opposition of Democrat governors in Arkansas and Alabama.\n\nThose governors were defying federal law for a cause—preservation of racial segregation—that the vast majority of voters, after a decade of reflection, were determined to reject. Today’s California Democrats are defying federal law for a cause—permanent amnesty for illegal immigrants—which it appears that voters, after a decade of reflection, are bent on rejecting as well.\n\nAs for the illegal immigrants themselves, I’m not aware that anyone has conducted a poll of them, or could, since people in their situation are wary of being interviewed. But as the workforce numbers suggest, for many, self-deportation, together perhaps with the Department of Homeland Security’s $1,000 travel stipend, is looking like a good option. One that may be taken up by many more than are legally deported.\n\nSo how’s Trump doin’? Better, perhaps, than his critics think.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The surprisingly warm exchange between two longtime political rivals seemed to reflect a new reality: with a vengeful Trump back in the White House, fire-ravaged California – and its Democratic governor – had a great deal at stake.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, Newsom met with Trump at the White House to lobby for federal disaster relief, then approved funding to strengthen the state’s legal defenses against challenges from the Trump administration. He invited Maga-world fixtures on to his podcast, including Steve Bannon, and infuriated progressives, and even some allies, when he said that it was “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to compete in girls’ sports – a wedge issue central to Trump’s conservative agenda. All the while, his state was suing the Trump administration – over executive actions on immigration, federal funding and tariffs – at a rate of more than one lawsuit a week.\n\nTheir fragile detente, already showing cracks, shattered spectacularly last week, when the president mobilized thousands of national guard troops and 700 marines – over the governor’s objections – to quell protests in Los Angeles sparked by immigration raids across the region.\n\nNewsom accused Trump of deliberately injecting chaos into a situation that local authorities had under control. Trump’s actions, he declared, were “madness” and marked an “unmistakable step toward authoritarianism”. Trump, in turn, called Newsom, whom he refers to as “Newscum”, grossly incompetent and suggested the governor should be arrested. “Gavin likes the publicity,” the president mused, though he later played down the threat.\n\nWith guards troops deployed in the streets of Los Angeles, the 57-year-old governor of the country’s most populous state delivered a formal, state-of-the-union-style address warning that the president was taking a “wrecking ball” to American democracy.\n\n“Look, this isn’t just about protests in LA,” Newsom said on Tuesday. “This is about all of us. This is about you.”\n\n“California may be first – but it clearly won’t end here. Other states are next,” he said. “Democracy is next.”\n\nFor months, Democrats, anti-Trump Republicans and a growing number of alarmed Americans had been clamoring for leaders who grasp what they say is the urgency of Trump’s assault on democratic norms and American institutions. When Trump activated California’s national guard troops, Newsom stepped into the ring – and hasn’t stopped swinging since.\n\n“This moment was thrust upon him,” said Mike Madrid, a sharp critic of Trump and former political director of the California Republican party, “and whether it was a battlefield conversion or a genuine moment, Gavin Newsom realized that the only way out of this was to fight.”\n\nIn the week since the national guard’s deployment to Los Angeles, Newsom has mounted an all-out offensive – battling Trump in the courts and in the court of public opinion. He has made himself ubiquitous: sitting for interviews with podcasters and YouTubers, national media and local media. On social media, he and his team are running a rapid response blitz – a stream of taunts, Star Wars memes and factchecks.\n\nNewsom sued to block the guard’s deployment without his consent. California later filed an emergency order asking a judge to bar the guard from assisting with immigration enforcement. On Thursday, a federal judge sided with the state, finding that Trump’s deployment of the guard was unlawful – though the victory was short-lived. Two hours later, the ninth US circuit court of appeals temporarily blocked the order.\n\n“He is not a king and he should stop acting like one,” Newsom said on Thursday, at a press conference before the ruling was paused.\n\nThe White House has responded in kind, with Trump hurling insults back at Newsom. When asked what crime Newsom might be charged with, Trump sniped: “His primary crime is running for governor, because he’s done such a bad job.”\n\nTrump, thanking the appeals court on Friday, said: “If I didn’t send the military into Los Angeles, that city would be burning to the ground right now” – a claim Newsom, city officials and local law enforcement strongly dispute.\n\nTensions escalated further on Thursday, when a senator from California, Alex Padilla, was forcibly removed and handcuffed after trying to ask a question at a press conference held by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, amid the ongoing protests in Los Angeles. Newsom called the episode “outrageous, dictatorial, and shameful”.\n\n“This is a moment that tests the mettle of leaders,” said Brian Brokaw, a longtime political adviser to Newsom. He noted that Newsom’s tenure was defined by crisis from the very start.\n\nThe day after he was elected in 2018, a gunman killed 12 people at a country music bar in Thousand Oaks and as the Camp fire – the deadliest wildfire in state history – raged toward the town of Paradise. Since then, Newsom has faced a near-constant onslaught: more fires, more mass shootings, floods, mudslides, drought, a global pandemic, mass protests after the murder of George Floyd, and the wildfires that swept Los Angeles earlier this year.\n\n“Newsom has pretty good instincts,” Brokaw said. “He knows what a moment like this requires – and that’s what you’re seeing from him now.”\n\nThe rapidly intensifying standoff between Trump and Newsom has rallied Democrats. Twenty-two Democratic governors signed a joint statement in support of California, calling Trump’s troop deployment “ineffective and dangerous”. The signatories spanned the ideological spectrum of the party and included several governors who are potential 2028 presidential contenders, such as JB Pritzker of Illinois, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Andy Beshear of Kentucky.\n\n“He has shown he’s not going to be intimidated, and we’re all for that,” Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, said earlier this week.\n\nEven some of his critics have been impressed. Ezra Levin, the co-founder of Indivisible, one of the groups behind Saturday’s “day of defiance” protests against Trump, said Newsom’s pugilistic response to the president’s “bullying” has been “spot on”.\n\n“I think he’s been one of the leading members of the ‘roll over and play dead’ faction, one of these dead-dog Democrats,” Levin said. “But maybe – maybe – he is shifting sides, and I think it is very important that we welcome people and leaders when they do that.”\n\nThe White House believes its maximalist response to unrest in California plays to its political advantage. Trump, who campaigned on a promise of mass deportations, has framed California’s resistance as an obstruction to what he says is a popular mandate. Images of protesters waving Mexican flags near burning robotaxis feed the rightwing narrative of disorder in Democratic-run cities such as Los Angeles.\n\n“To be very cynical about this, you can argue that this benefits both principals,” said Bill Whalen, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution thinktank at Stanford University. “Donald Trump gets to swing at his favorite piñata, California, but Gavin Newsom doesn’t mind taking the whacks because it plays pretty well with the Democratic base.”\n\nAccording to a YouGov flash poll, 45% of Americans disapprove of the Los Angeles protests, while 36% approve. Similar shares disapprove of Trump’s deployment of the marines – 47% to 34% – and the national guard – 45% to 38%.\n\nSince Trump’s 2024 victory, many Democrats have taken pains to show support for law enforcement and border security.\n\nSome say Newsom’s approach offers a clear path forward. He has been unequivocal in condemning sporadic violence, vowing “zero tolerance” for bad actors. At the same time, he has offered a full-throated defense of the city’s immigrant communities, accusing Trump of tearing apart families and “disappearing” neighbors.\n\n“What’s happening right now is very different than anything we’ve seen before,” Newsom said in his Tuesday address, accusing federal agents of indiscriminately targeting Latino neighborhoods. “Trump is pulling a military dragnet across LA, well beyond his stated intent to just go after violent and serious criminals.”\n\nConservatives say Newsom’s posture is precisely what helped Trump make inroads in some of the bluest corners of the country last year. Steve Hilton, a former top adviser to former UK prime minister David Cameron now running for governor of California, accused Newsom of trying to “gaslight us”.\n\n“Do your job,” he said on Fox News, “instead of pretending this is fine.”\n\nNewsom rose to prominence as the mayor of San Francisco, defying state law to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples. He served as the state’s lieutenant governor for eight years before being elected governor in the middle of Trump’s first term, riding a wave of progressive anger. He survived a 2021 recall attempt, fueled in part by backlash to his handling of the pandemic, and was easily re-elected in 2022. He campaigned aggressively for Biden in 2024, even as some in the party hoped he’d run himself. When Biden dropped out, Newsom quickly endorsed his fellow Californian, “fearless” Kamala Harris.\n\nDemocrats’ staggering losses in November left the party leaderless and without power in Washington. As Democrats grasped for answers – how to oppose an emboldened president whom voters chose over them – Newsom launched a podcast. Some speculated Newsom’s moves – interviewing far-right figures on his podcast, cracking down on homeless encampments and moving to scale back health coverage for immigrants without legal status – were part of a calculated pivot toward the political center, in preparation for a 2028 presidential run.\n\nAsked recently at a press conference if he was trying to shed his liberal persona, Newsom said he had always been a “hard-headed pragmatist”. “I’m not an ideologue,” he added.\n\nCalifornia – the biggest blue state in the country – has long served as Trump’s favorite foil. From homelessness and crime to immigration and climate policy, Trump has painted the state as a cautionary tale – a failed experiment in liberal governance now a “symbol of our nation’s decline”.\n\nThis week, amid his clash with Newsom, Trump signed into law a measure blocking California’s vehicle emissions rules and his administration announced plans to abolish two of the state’s newest national monuments.\n\n“If it’s a day ending in Y, it’s another day of Trump’s war on California,” the governor’s office tweeted.\n\nSteve Maviglio, a Democratic political consultant, said Newsom’s “guerrilla warfare” tactics may raise the governor’s national profile – but at a cost.\n\n“We know that the president doesn’t respond well to being attacked,” Maviglio said, adding: “It’s likely going to result in a lot less federal dollars coming our way – which is about the last thing we need right now with a multibillion-dollar budget deficit.”\n\nYet Newsom’s attempt at conciliation yielded little protection. Earlier this month, the Trump administration warned it may pull billions in funding from California’s long-delayed high-speed rail project. Trump has threatened to “maybe permanently” strip federal funding if the state continues to allow transgender athletes to compete in girls’ and women’s sports. And California is still waiting for the disaster aid Newsom sought after the fires.\n\nNewsom has argued in recent interviews that Trump can’t be placated. The governor suggested the state had leverage: it could withhold the billions in taxes its residents pay the federal government. (He has since tempered the idea, but said he urged his team to get “creative” on how the state might push back on Trump’s threats.)\n\nNewsom also suggested that growing public opposition to the immigration crackdown was working, after Trump conceded that his immigration tactics were hurting agriculture and hospitality. “Turns out, chasing hardworking people through ranches and snatching women and children off the streets is not good policy,” Newsom shot back.\n\nThough protests have calmed, the situation remains volatile. With the appeals court decision, Trump remains in command of the national guard through at least next week. On Friday, US marines temporarily detained a man outside the Wilshire Federal Building in Los Angeles – the first known detention of a civilian by active-duty troops deployed there by Trump.\n\nSpeaking in Los Angeles, Noem pledged to “liberate” Los Angeles and vowed that the Trump administration would continue its immigration operations across the region.\n\nAhead of planned protests on Saturday, Newsom ordered the state to “pre-deploy” additional resources to support law enforcement throughout the state. Organized as a show of defiance against Trump’s military parade staged in the streets of Washington DC on Saturday to celebrate the US army’s 250th anniversary and the president’s 79th birthday, the events have multiplied since Trump deployed guard troops to Los Angeles.\n\nFor Newsom, the stakes are bigger than California. He has framed this moment as a test of democratic resilience in the face of creeping authoritarianism. And for those who have long sounded the alarm, the governor is meeting it.\n\n“He’s become what Democrats nationally have been waiting for since the election,” Madrid said. “He’s the tip of the spear – the more strenuously he fights, the more aggressive he is, the more he uses Trump’s tactics against him, the more he’s going to be rewarded.”\n\nDavid Smith in Washington and Rachel Leingang contributed reporting","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/moment-thrust-upon-him-gavin-153437821.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/theguardian_763/0ef951a150197198b72467ad25548e38","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 15:34:37","author":"Lauren Gambino In Los Angeles","authors":["Lauren Gambino In Los Angeles"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":331409860,"title":"Breaking: US politician dead, another wounded in 'politically motivated' shootings","text":"A US state politician and her husband have been killed, and a state senator and his wife have been wounded, after they were allegedly attacked in their homes by a gunman posing as a police officer.\n\nMelissa Hortman, a member of Minnesota's House of Representatives, and her husband were both killed, state governor Tim Walz said.

Both legislators are close friends and devoted to their families and public service\".\n\nFake police officer 'manipulated way' into victims' home\n\nThe superintendent of Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Drew Evans, said police were called to Senator Hoffman's home about 2am Saturday, local time.\n\nHe said about 90 minutes later, officers who were \"proactively\" checking on Ms Hortman's home in a nearby suburb \"encountered the individual who immediately fired at them\". \n\nChief Bruley said the gunman was dressed as a police officer and had used \"the trust of this badge and this uniform to manipulate their way into the home\".\n\nHe had driven to Ms Hortman's home in a vehicle equipped with police lights \"that looked exactly like an SUV squad car\".\n\nPolice exchanged fire with the gunman before he retreated back into the home, Chief Bruley said. The man then fled.\n\nMs Hortman was the House leader of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor (DFL) Party, the state affiliate of the national Democratic Party. She served as House Speaker for six years until earlier this year.\n\nThe House DFL caucus said it was shocked and devastated. \n\n\"This is an unspeakable act of political violence that should never happen in the United States of America,\" it said in a statement.\n\nMr Walz said he had activated Minnesota's Emergency Operations Center and was providing the police in the two suburbs \"the full resources\" of the state.","summary":"A manhunt is underway in Minnesota after Democrats Melissa Hortman, who was killed alongside her husband, and John Hoffman were targeted by a suspect posing as a police officer. ","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-06-15/minnesota-politicians-melissa-hortman-john-hoffman-shootings/105417846","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0ff358ccc6ad463d49a05fdca0644347?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=450&cropW=800&xPos=0&yPos=15&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-14 15:29:51","author":"Brad Ryan","authors":["Brad Ryan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.596}]}
