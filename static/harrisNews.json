We do not support reckless chaotic tariffs on all countries at crazy rates.\"\n\nFain dismissed claims by the US auto industry that tariffs would damage US carmakers and lead to higher prices, likening the statements to those during 2023 UAW strike negotiations that ultimately resulted in hefty wage hikes for workers at General Motors, Ford and Jeep-maker Stellantis.\n\n\"Turns out the companies lied,\" Fain said. \"They could afford to do the right thing then and they can afford to do the right thing now.\"\n\nThe comments were Fain's most expansive to the national membership since Trump returned to office in January.\n\nFain shot to prominence with a strike of Detroit's \"Big Three\" automakers in 2023 but his zealous campaigning for Democrat Kamala Harris' presidential campaign proved controversial in a union where Trump also enjoys a vocal base of support.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump paused for 90 days many of his most onerous tariffs on every trading partner except China, while significantly raising levies on the world's second biggest economy.\n\nBut Trump has maintained a 25 percent tariff on imported autos that went into effect last week, as well as a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and aluminum that went into effect in mid-March.\n\nFain described the auto tariffs as a means to end the \"race to the bottom\" in the car industry, asserting that GM, Ford and Stellantis could add 50,000 jobs if they chose to operate US factories at full capacity instead of shifting production to Mexico where labor is cheap.\n\nTrump's administration is the first \"in my lifetime that’s been willing to do something about this broken free trade system,\" Fain said.\n\nBut Fain blasted the Trump administration's cuts to health research funding, attacks on Social Security and crackdown on free speech that has included the detention of Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil, a former UAW member.\n\n\"We've seen the absolute trampling of constitutional rights,\" Fain said.\n\nSource: AFP","summary":"The head of the US auto workers union endorsed car tariffs Thursday as a way to address the \"free trade disaster\" while rejecting use of the levies for \"political games.\" \"We don't support the use of tariffs for political games about immigration or fentanyl.","url":"https://yen.com.gh/business-economy/281320-us-auto-union-praises-trump-tariffs/","image":"https://cdn.yen.com.gh/images/1200x675/dca57ca70f89ebea.jpeg?v=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-11 00:41:04","author":"Samuel Obour","authors":["Samuel Obour"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":309902234,"title":"Viral CNN clip of Anderson Cooper getting schooled on pronouns exposes a major fault in the Dem party","text":"Even in the chaos surrounding Trump’s tariffs, the Democrats can’t seem to get it together. They are wandering aimlessly in the desert without a compass, clue or meaningful leadership.\n\nIn their great search for a base, pols are taking part in Q&As, rallies and podcasts. But they could save a lot of money and time by simply watching an 18-second clip from a CNN town hall that aired Wednesday.\n\nIt’s arguably the most consequential bit of game film from the Dems’ performance in the last few years.\n\nHost Anderson Cooper, sitting with Sen. Bernie Sanders, tosses the mic to a woman in the audience, saying, “I want to introduce Grace Thomas. She’s a local civil rights attorney. She’s a Democrat.”\n\nCue the record scratch.\n\nThomas wags a finger at Cooper and takes an officious tone to proclaim, “It’s they/them pronouns, actually.”\n\nThen, without an ounce of self awareness but packing a motherlode — I mean themlode — of condescension, the attorney notes that “men of all racial demographics are turning away from the Democratic Party. But of course, white men in particular do not feel that the DNC‘s messaging targets them in the issues that they care about.”\n\nHmmm, I wonder why.\n\n“Should progressive campaigns craft policies and messaging to better encapsulate these voters? And if the answer is yes, how do they do so without abandoning marginalized voters of color and gender?” asks Thomas, who is unmistakably female-presenting — not even bordering on ambiguous, lumpy Pat-from- “Saturday Night Live” territory.\n\nBut Thomas answered her own question before it even left her lips. The truth emerged when she flashed her badge as a high-ranking member of the pronoun police and issued Cooper a citation for misgendering.\n\nThis woman is a perfect avatar for the Democrat party: so blinded by her own bizarre fantasies and obsessions about identity she doesn’t realize that “they/them” is the problem.\n\nTurns out dudes of all races and creeds, as well as many women, are allergic to being lectured by crazy ladies who have so many advanced degrees they need plural third-person pronouns.\n\nIf the party that once championed the working class wants to win again, they need to get back to basics. Instead of clinging to Identitarianism and nonsensical labels, they need to offer ideas.\n\nReal ideas that help real people and make their lives better. Not raging against the gender binary machine, which solves nothing but gives an overeducated, privileged elitist a minority box to check.\n\nWhile a few Dems, including John Fetterman and even Gavin Newsom, have conceded the need to move back into the land of common sense, much of the ultra-progressive left is still training for the victimhood Olympics — even though the games were officially canceled with the outcome of the November elections.\n\nTake Sanders’ response. He admitted that Dems have failed on some economic issues. But he indulged Thomas instead of being as tough-talking as he is on the economy.\n\n“I believe that we got to end all forms of bigotry,” he said. He should have told her the truth: that a fixation on identity is a political albatross.\n\nDuring the last election, the Dems’ disconnect with males was undeniable. In order to bridge the gap created by what James Carville called “too many preachy females,” Kamala Harris picked wacko Minnesota governor Tim Walz, who the party tried to package as some sort of Midwestern macho man capable of hunting as hard as he hugs.\n\nBut Americans saw through Walz’s cosplay, scoring Trump a decisive win over Harris, especially among male voters.\n\nTo find the promised land and recapture the male vote, the Dems need to defund and dismantle the pronoun police entirely.","summary":"The condescending clip was arguably the most consequential bit of game film from the Dems' performance in the last few years.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/10/opinion/anderson-cooper-getting-schooled-on-pronouns-shows-dems-problem/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/cnn-pronouns_720.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=720","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mQJpi1YO-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-10 23:08:20","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.146},{"id":309902226,"title":"The week in whoppers: CNN’s Jake Tapper denies his blatant bias, lefty  editor praises Sen.

The judge narrowed the lawsuit, however, by dismissing a claim by the plaintiffs of intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in federal court last October by Yusef Salaam, Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Antron Brown and Korey Wise, called the Central Park Five. The plaintiffs are seeking unspecified monetary damages for reputational and emotional harms as well as punitive damages.\n\nShanin Specter, lead attorney for the plaintiffs, in a statement on Thursday welcomed the judge's ruling and said he and his clients \"look forward to discovery, trial and the ultimate vindication of these five fine men.\"\n\nKarin Sweigart, a lawyer representing Trump in the lawsuit, in a statement said that \"this baseless lawsuit is yet another unfounded and meritless attack against President Trump.\" Sweigart called the narrowing of the lawsuit a victory for the Republican president.\n\nAdvertisement · Scroll to continue\n\nThe White House declined to comment.\n\nThe men were cleared in 2002 based on new DNA evidence and another person's confession.\n\nTrump falsely said during a September 10 presidential debate with Democrat Kamala Harris that the men had killed someone and pleaded guilty, the plaintiffs said in their October lawsuit. Attorneys for the men said they gave false confessions that they later recanted. They never pleaded guilty.\n\nThe lawsuit said Trump's \"demonstrably false\" statements cast the plaintiffs in \"a harmful false light.\"\n\nIn seeking dismissal of the lawsuit, Trump's lawyers said in a court filing in December that his statements about the men were legally protected expressions of opinion under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.

Sgamma is the director of Western Energy Alliance, a Denver-based oil and gas trade group made up of over 300 companies. She has long advocated for the Interior Department’s BLM to focus on the expansion of oil and natural gas drilling, mining and for cattle to graze on public lands. It’s a match made in the Trump administration’s anti-preservation, anti-renewable resources heaven. So what went wrong?\n\nSgamma dared to be horrified by the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters. Even worse, she expressed it — a sin that Trump has used as grudge fuel against key members of Congress and former officials in his first administration for years. \n\nThe investigative watchdog and journalism group Documented obtained a copy of a letter that Sgamma sent to the coalition of gas and oil companies that make up Western Energy Alliance on Jan. 7, 2021.\n\n“The events yesterday at the Capitol were so shocking that our policy engagement with and PAC support for the Trump Administration compels me to speak up,” she wrote. “I am disgusted by the violence witnessed yesterday and President Trump’s role in spreading misinformation that incited it.”\n\nThe letter was made public on Tuesday and by Thursday, Sgamma withdrew herself from consideration for the position. She and the White House did not address the letter or give a reason for the sudden change but it doesn’t take much to jump to the very logical conclusion — she got caught committing the deadliest of the seven: disagreeing with MAGA.\n\nWhy The F*ck Would I Talk To H.R. McMaster?\n\nCBS News had a funny story last night, offering the mildest of palate cleansers.\n\nJust a few days before SignalGate broke, Trump’s aides in the White House made another disastrous mistake: They dialed H.R. McMaster, Trump’s former national security adviser (whom he now loathes), instead of South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster. Trump reportedly began speaking into the phone without waiting for the person on the other end to respond or say hello. H.R. McMaster, who has been a vocal critic of Trump since he was fired during Trump’s first administration, had to butt in:\n\n“Mr. President, this is H.R. McMaster,” he said into the phone.\n\n“Why the f*** would I talk” to H.R. McMaster? Trump asked dismissively, and then Trump launched into a scathing critique of his former aide, two sources said.\n\nThe call was brief.\n\nPotential For Some Justice For Central Park Five?\n\nPresident Donald Trump lost a bid to dismiss a defamation lawsuit brought by plaintiffs known as the Exonerated Five (formerly the Central Park Five). Thursday’s court ruling brings Trump closer to potential civil liability for comments he made about them during a presidential debate against Kamala Harris last year, but it doesn’t guarantee that the plaintiffs will ultimately succeed in their case.\n\nDisenfranchising Is The Point\n\nOn Thursday House Republicans passed the Republican-led Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which is a redundant piece of legislation making it illegal for non-citizens to vote in federal elections (that is already illegal and rarely happens). \n\nThe bill was introduced last year ahead of the 2024 election, as Republicans focused on the false narrative that non-citizens were voting en masse in elections on behalf of Democrats. There is no evidence to support that non-citizens have been voting in elections. Instead, the narrative was used as a way for Republicans to sow seeds of doubt in the election system and to set themselves up to cry voter fraud if Donald Trump had lost the 2024 election. \n\nVoting experts and critics of the bill say the measure will have the effect of disenfranchising millions of eligible voters, who can’t easily access documents required for documentary proof of citizenship. According to reporting from the Brennan Center, the SAVE Act has the potential to disenfranchise tens of millions of voters.\n\n— Khaya Himmelman\n\nIn Case You Missed It \n\nYesterday’s Most Read Story\n\nWhat We Are Reading\n\nTrump moves to legally enforce 2020 election denialism \n\nPressed for evidence against Mahmoud Khalil, government cites its power to deport people for beliefs","summary":"Kathleen Sgamma unceremoniously withdrew herself as President Trump&#8217;s nominee to run the Interior Department&#8217;s Bureau of Land Management on Thursday...","url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/where-things-stand/cult-of-personality-has-strict-rules","image":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-10-at-3.44.23 PM.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 21:48:30","author":"Nicole Lafond","authors":["Nicole Lafond"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.111},{"id":309891778,"title":"Trump targets law firm that made Fox News pay for 2020 election lies","text":"Donald Trump is targeting the law firm that represented Dominion Voting Systems, the voting services company that sued Fox News for airing lies about the 2020 election—and won a $787 million settlement.\n\nThe president signed an executive order on Wednesday accusing Susman Godfrey LLP of spearheading “efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.” The order claimed the firm “funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military” and supports racial discrimination.\n\nTrump offered no evidence of his allegations and complained that the firm offers scholarships and job opportunities to students of color.

The suit involved multiple lies that Fox aired while reporting on the 2020 election, promoting fake and debunked conspiracy theories that alleged Dominion was involved in manipulating the result of the election in favor of Joe Biden and against Trump.\n\nDocuments released in the early stages of the case showed that top Fox News primetime personalities knew that Trump and his team were lying about election fraud, but amplified those stories on-air anyway.\n\nThe case validated decades of criticism heaped on the right-wing network, which is central to the propaganda efforts of the conservative movement and the Republican Party. It showed, once again, that Fox News lies.\n\nEventually Fox settled with Dominion instead of going ahead with a trial, sparing the network more embarrassment while paying out $787 million.\n\n“We acknowledge the Court’s rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false,” Fox admitted in a statement following disclosure of the settlement.\n\nTrump cannot acknowledge that he and Mike Pence were resoundingly defeated by President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. That is why he is going after Susman Godfrey—one of the few entities that has ever made Fox News pay for its lies.\n\nThe executive order came on the same day Trump ordered the government to pursue investigations against his former staffers Chris Krebs and Miles Taylor, who spoke out about his election lies. It is part of a concerted effort by Trump to relitigate the election he lost and rewrite history.\n\nDespite the occasional tiff, Fox News is still very much in Trump’s corner and has spent years manipulating the truth in service of his ego. This executive order shows that he has the network’s back as well, and is willing to use the power of the federal government to help out the right’s propaganda superstar.","summary":"Donald Trump is targeting the law firm that represented Dominion Voting Systems, the voting services company that sued Fox News for airing lies about the 2020 election—and won a $787 million settlement.\n\n\n\nThe president signed an executive order on Wednesday accusing Susman Godfrey LLP of spearheading “efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.” The order claimed the firm “funds groups that engage in dangerous efforts to undermine the effectiveness of the United States military” and supports racial discrimination.\n\n\n\nTrump offered no evidence of his allegations and complained that the firm offers scholarships and job opportunities to students of color.

A Big Speech, a Bigger Book, and Perhaps a Run for Office","text":"With that, Harris briefly backed away from the mic, laughing and grinning. “I thought she performed incredibly well—one of her best speeches,” says Ashley Etienne, who worked as Harris’s communications director during her first year as vice president and was in the room last week. “The way I read it was, she felt a little lighter in her presentation but heavier in the depth of what she was saying.”\nThose eight minutes may have also been a preview of what’s to come: Harris, according to an associate, is now writing a longer and broader speech that will address the chaotic moment the country is enduring, with a tentative aim of delivering it in the next several months. She is also at work on a book. Both moves will stoke even more speculation about Harris’s plans, which are already the subject of considerable debate in her own camp: Should she run for governor of California in 2026 or mount a third presidential bid in 2028? Or none of the above? “She’s taking a second to figure out how she can best serve in this moment,” a senior adviser says. “People are expecting her to only be guided by this blind ambition of, ‘I want to be in charge,’ when in fact a lot of the roles she’s played are because one, she wants to do the job, but two, she knows how she can make the biggest difference.”\nHarris has mostly been offstage during President Trump’s first 100 days, drawing some criticism from a Democratic Party in search of leadership. She certainly earned a break, having run a frantic 107-day presidential campaign, which saw her pile up 75 million votes but lose the Electoral College decisively. Harris took a short vacation in Hawaii, put on a stoic face at Trump’s inauguration, and helped distribute food in Altadena amid the January wildfires in Southern California. Harris has also, a friend says, been catching up on her passion for cooking, spending time with her nieces and nephews, and soliciting suggestions for TV shows to binge-watch.\nBut even though Harris is out of elected office for the first time in 21 years, she is not entirely out of the game. She has been working the phones; focusing on how to improve the party’s state-level infrastructure and social media presence; chatting up donors; and congratulating activists for helping defeat four Republican ballot measures in Louisiana.\nHarris has also been assessing the reasons for her defeat, if not dwelling on the what-ifs. “In my experience, she is not the kind of person who ruminates on the past,” says Jamal Simmons, who served as vice presidential communications director in the middle of Harris’s term. “Working for her, sometimes you want to spend time licking your wounds or celebrating your success. She’s thinking about, Here’s where we are—what do we need to do to get to the next place? You’re like, Can we have a cocktail first?”\nHer team’s early reading, perhaps unsurprisingly, is that Harris wasn’t the problem in 2024. “What she ran on—health care and housing and small businesses—that wasn’t the wrong message,” says Sheila Nix, Harris’s chief of staff during the campaign and now in private life. “The people who heard that message, they liked it. So it shouldn’t be, ‘Oh my God, throw your hands up in the air. We don’t even know what to say to people.’ No, that’s not true. The values she talked about and the things she cared about were important to the people who heard them.”\nOne obvious place for Harris to go next is the 2026 California governor’s race—an option too obvious, in the view of some of her advisers, who see quickly jumping into the contest as the political equivalent of dating a rebound boyfriend. Others believe she’ll be unable to stay out of the action for long. “She hasn’t been out of public service during her entire career,” a Harris insider says. “I think it will be difficult for her to pass up a bird in the hand.”\nHarris has told allies she will make up her mind by the end of this summer. At least 10 Democrats have already declared their candidacy to succeed the term-limited current governor, Gavin Newsom. Harris would instantly become the front-runner if she were to join the field, and most of the other Democratic candidates would probably step aside, though former Los Angeles mayor Antonio Villaraigosa has said he’d stay in the fight, and he could be formidable in a runoff. “He has a stronger relationship with Republicans in the state than Kamala does, and he has a more real relationship with Latino voters across the state than Kamala does,” says Mike Trujillo, a former strategist for Villaraigosa’s mayoral campaign. In March, former representative Katie Porter, another Democrat in the gubernatorial race, also made an indirect dig at Harris’s delayed decision-making: “No one should be waiting to lead. I think we need to make a case right now.”\nYet Harris needs to determine whether she wants to run for president again in three years before deciding whether she wants to run for governor next year. Her keeping the national option open provided a not-so-subtle subtext for her speech last week: It came as possible 2028 Democratic primary rivals—including New Jersey senator Cory Booker, Illinois governor JB Pritzker, Connecticut senator Chris Murphy, New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and even former Harris running mate Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota—have been aggressively promoting themselves. They are in the middle of the conversation that has been raging for the past few months, about how the Democratic Party can and should remake itself—a discussion from which Harris has been largely absent.\n“I think she deserves to be part of that conversation. She’s earned the right to put her thumb on the scale of what’s next here,” a Harris insider says. “Democrats, in general, are lacking messengers who have name ID and respect. And I think people need to remember that she only lost the popular vote by 1.5%.”\nMaybe Harris will benefit from maintaining a relatively low profile for now, allowing Trump to flail and giving voters space to forget what they disliked about her. But if she ramps up her visibility without a more potent message, she risks allowing an unflattering conventional wisdom to congeal. “Right after the election, people were like, ‘Oh, she did everything she could,’” a former high-ranking Biden-Harris campaign operative says. “Now the consensus is building that the future of the party isn’t someone like her—an overly cautious candidate who let other people define her and played things extremely, extremely safe. And even in 2028, the Biden baggage is gonna be an issue for her.”\nAs thoroughly as Harris laughed at her own joke last week, she certainly can’t enjoy being proven right about Trump and watching from the sidelines as he demolishes the federal government and so many democratic norms. Harris closed her speech by vowing, “I’m not going anywhere.” Now she just needs to figure out where, exactly, she wants to go.","summary":"“She’s earned the right to put her thumb on the scale,” says one source, with Harris insiders describing the ex-veep’s strategy for what comes next.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/kamala-harriss-next-moves-a-big-speech-a-bigger-book-and-perhaps-a-run-for-office","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/67f7f38e7e79c15d9119b9c0/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/kamala-harris-california-conference.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 21:08:51","author":"Chris Smith","authors":["Chris Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.129},{"id":309913450,"title":"Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s Secrets During 2024 Elections EXPOSED in New Book!","text":"A new book exposes Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s political game. Journalists are always hovering around the White House to collect the latest scoops, which help them write scandalous stories about some of the most popular names in US politics. We don’t blame them! The irony lies in how controversial they are and yet so irresistible!\n\nIn recent news, just like how journalist Micheal Wolff wrote about Donald Trump in his book, shocking new details from the 2024 presidential election have emerged in ‘Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House’ by journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes. While we aren’t sure if this book will be as hot and happening as author Micheal Wolff’s ‘All or Nothing: How Trump Recaptured America,’ it sure will be spilling some inside details about the behind-the-scenes of what shaped the 2024 campaigns.\n\nAs per USA Today, from former vice president Kamala Harris being misled by her team to Joe Biden’s deep reluctance to fully back her candidacy after stepping aside, the book will leave people hooked to it. Moreover, what’s interesting is that the book has some explosive facts like Harris’ campaign falsely assured her of a likely win and then gaslighted her to believe that victory was in her favour.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Biden’s hesitant handover of power due to his age and many other instances was marked by a tense private exchange, during which he initially declined to endorse her. Kamala Harris had to reportedly request him to offer public support desperately until he finally agreed.\n\nComing to you on April 1.\nYou can preorder here: https://t.co/xxs67WSXwg pic.twitter.com/HiHGBJFCS9\n— Amie Parnes (@amieparnes) January 29, 2025\n\nFurthermore, both journalists claimed in their book that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi played a crucial role in carrying the nomination shift, which the authors described as a ‘Shakespearean’ move.” (like a “knifing” or “a real Brutus moment.) The fallout caused chaos in the Democratic Party, with Barack Obama reportedly trying to set up a convention to avoid Harris despite the White House supporting her.\n\nInterestingly, Jonathan Allens spoke to the USA Today and said that perhaps this book would come as a surprise for many people, and several Democrats would be upset to witness how Joe Biden put his legacy ahead of the party’s future. The book was released on April 1 by HarperCollins.\n\nMichael talks to @amieparnes & @jonallendc about their book “Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House,” an inside look at the 2024 battle for the White House, arguably the most consequential in American history.\nHear the #bookclub #podcast 🎧📖 https://t.co/hMfkMGda8u pic.twitter.com/5jxLPcrJpK\n— Michael Smerconish (@smerconish) April 7, 2025\n\nAs per RadarOnline, during the campaign, Harris failed to present a clear vision for her leadership and address key concerns like immigration and economic challenges. She also struggled to win over key voting groups, such as Latino, Black, and younger citizens and even lost support among women, who had backed Joe Biden in 2020.\n\nMoreover, reports of Harris being low-key after a loss have raised a lot of questions in the public eye. Amidst all this chaos, Kamala’s husband, Doug Emhoff, has publicly insisted that she is still an important figure in the party with whom she made headlines and sparked alleged talks of divorce.\n\nBut, hopefully, that isn’t true. Meanwhile, In February 2025, Harris signed with Creative Artists Agency (CAA) to pursue speaking and publishing opportunities, and she also attended Broadway shows like Gypsy and A Wonderful World.\n\nDuring a student event in December, fight against things that need a voice and matter to improve the world. She might consider running for California governor in 2026 when Gavin Newsom steps down or contest another run for the White House presidency in 2028. What lies in the future remains unknown, but until then, enjoy the book and don’t forget to leave good reviews about it if you like it.","summary":"Journalists Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes are set to reveal some explosive inside details about the controversial 2024 presidential election in their latest book!

The Sikh farmers first came to Canada to work in the saw mills and later on migrated to California USA. Centuries old Gurdwaras are still places of attraction for our youth. I have gone through the official records and have found that citizenship of America was granted to Indians for the first time through an Act of Parliament in 1946. It is recorded that this was achieved through a sustained campaign led by J J Singh who was then the President of Indian League of America.\n\nIn August 2020, the media published headline stories mentioning that Sabrina Singh had become the first ever Indian-American as Press Secretary to the Vice Presidential nominee of a major political party. She was picked up by Kamala Harris who was elected as Vice President of the US. She was earlier the spokeswoman of two Democratic Presidential candidates. The media followed her and discovered that Sabrina Singh was the granddaughter of J J Singh who had been the President of Indian League of America in New York when India was fighting for independence. She tweeted that her grandfather mounted a campaign in 1940 against the racially discriminatory policies of the US and fought for Indians to obtain citizenship of America.\n\nJag Jit Singh (JJ Singh) was born in a Sikh family on October 5, 1897 in Rawalpindi (now in Pakistan). His father was a Judicial Officer. He studied in U.K. and migrated to the US. He opened a fabric store in New York and started importing textiles from India.\n\nSEE ALSO: Sabrina Singh joins #BidenHarris ticket\n\nIn 1941 he was elected President of the India League for America, a New York based organization that spoke for India and Indians living in the United States. At that time there were about 4000 Indians in the USA but they did not have citizenship rights. J J Singh along with S. Anup Singh and Mubarak Ali Khan lobbied in Washington corridors of power and met Senators and led a sustained campaign with the support of leading Americans which resulted in the passage of the Luce–Cellar Act of 1946.\n\nThis law granted for the first time citizenship rights to these 4,000 Indians living there and established a quota of 100 Indians immigrants every year. The Act was signed by President Harry Truman on July 2, 1946 and after signing the Act, he gifted the pen with which he had affixed his signature to JJ Singh who was standing with him in the White House. Interestingly, that pen is now with Sabrina Singh, who has been Deputy Press Secretary to President Joe Biden.\n\nAnother landmark of J J Singh to help India was reported in The New York Times on Feb 28, 1944, United Nations Relief & Rehabilitation Administration in a meeting in Atlantic City, decided to provide help to the millions of people who were starving due to the Second World War. Burmese refugees were included but not the Indians. J.J Singh went to Washington to lobby and organized a campaign to get an amendment to feed the hungry Indians alongside. Finally the foreign relations committee of the Senate approved the Amended Bill. The singular efforts of JJ Singh brought huge relief to millions of people in India.\n\nHe remained bachelor to fully devote his time and energy for the cause of India. Finally, at the age of 54, in October 1951 he married to Malti Saksena, daughter of Sh. R.R. Saksena, High Commissioner for India to Canada and former Consul General in New York. The couple had two sons who were born in the US.\n\nIn 1959, JJ Singh decided to move back to India to raise his children in his home country. It was reported that his farewell lunch before departure was quite a gathering which included the Supreme Court Justice, W-O-Douglas, Vice President Richard Nixon and the New York Mayor R. F. Wagner. The New York Times reported on Jan 18, 1959: “U.S. Loses ‘Envoy’ to the call of India.” There was also an editorial on him in the paper. The Mayor of New York hosted a lunch for him. M.C. Chagla, the then Ambassador of India in USA, called JJ Singh “a great unofficial Ambassador of India to that country”. He further added that future Ambassadors from India would miss JJ Singh’s advice about American politics and culture. The Times named him “The life and soul of Indian League”.\n\nBack in India, J.J. Singh settled in Delhi and enjoyed an active social life. He remained an avid supporter of the civil rights and social justice movements. He fully supported Jayaprakash Narayan campaign to save democracy.\n\nHe died in 1976 in Delhi. Later, both his sons Man Mohan Singh and Manjit Singh migrated to the US.\n\nIt is astonishing that such an illustrious person who earned so much goodwill for India in the US and generated a great deal of support from the American media for cause of the country and Indian immigrants was totally ignored by the Government of Independent India. This is in stark contrast to the recognition accorded to Krishna Menon, by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, who was also credited fighting for India’s cause in London. It is high time that at least the historic role that JJ Singh played for India is properly recognized and displayed in India’s Diplomatic Centres in USA.\n\nTarlochan Singh is a former Indian MP and chairman of the National Commission for Minorities from 2003 to 2006.\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nDr Manmohan Singh: Priceless diamond (Asia Samachar, 31 Dec 2024)\n\nASIA SAMACHAR is an online newspaper for Sikhs / Punjabis in Southeast Asia and beyond.

One issue: Zachary competed in the girls’ competition as Lia Rose. Another problem: As Zachary, two years prior, he finished dead last in the high jump on the Junior Varsity level. \n\nThis time around, however, Zachary, as Lia, won easily with a jump of 4 feet, 8 inches. But when Zachary competed against other boys, his jump was 4 feet, 6 inches. The winning jump for the JV on the boys’ side that day? Five feet, 6 inches, a full foot higher than Zach’s. \n\nThis is not unlike the most infamous transgender athlete of the decade: Lia Thomas. Lia, when he was a young man named Will, was ranked 538th in college swimming. But when Will became Lia at the University of Pennsylvania, she won a national championship by beating Kentucky’s Riley Gaines, the odds-on favorite — if the race was left only to women. \n\n“It was a bit disheartening,” Gaines said after the race. “It really was. I left the pool with no trophy. Not a big deal, but it was the goal that I had set all year.”\n\n“It’s almost like they’re trying to back [transgender athletes] more than … 90-95% of the rest of the swimmers who are kind of bummed by and affected by the rules that were in place for Lia to swim,” Gaines added.\n\nThe examples are endless. The results are not only disheartening for those who trained their whole lives to win a varsity or a national championship but are also becoming increasingly dangerous. \n\nTake Payton McNabb, a female high school volleyball player who was struck so hard in the head by a spiked ball from a male athlete claiming to be female that she suffered a concussion, brain bleed, and two black eyes. McNabb also has experienced partial paralysis and a loss of peripheral vision on her right side. President Donald Trump honored McNabb during his address to the Joint Session of Congress, prompting a standing ovation from the Republican side of the House chamber and silence from the Democratic side. \n\nIn Massachusetts, a male high school field hockey player hit a ball so hard that it knocked out several teeth of a female player. Boys can play on girls’ teams under the state’s “equal pay act.” \n\nIn another instance, at Somerset Berkley High School outside Boston, Ryan Cook was awarded MVP honors after a majority vote from coaches in the conference. \n\nThe examples are seemingly endless, and it’s obviously the stuff of insanity. It’s also happening across the pond in the United Kingdom, where two men identifying as women just competed for the women’s Ultimate Pool championship after eliminating all biological women to get to the finals. \n\n“The evidence that we’ve received from our expert witnesses shows that I have no advantage. They’ve shown that pool isn’t a gender-affected sport … We’re not talking about boxing or golf — we’re talking about pool,” said champion Harriet Haynes in an interview with the Independent. \n\nYup. We’re supposed to believe that two males played each other for the championship just by coincidence. And if there is no evidence that there is no advantage for biological males, why hasn’t one biological woman ever been crowned champion of a men’s competition in the sport?\n\nRhetorical question. \n\nSince Donald Trump’s victory on Nov. 5, the culture shift has been undeniable. Some Ladies Professional Golf Association players on the women’s golf tour have been doing the Trump YMCA dance after years of being denounced for even thinking of showing support for him. \n\nChampion sports teams are appearing at the White House without a hint of controversy, including the Los Angeles Dodgers on Monday. And most importantly, female athletes are increasingly taking a stand against males seeking to dominate them, embarrass them, and potentially injure them. \n\nWe witnessed this recently at the University of Maryland in College Park during a fencing tournament after biological female Stephanie Turner refused to face a transgender opponent by taking a knee. The video of the forfeiture quickly went viral, generating tens of millions of views. \n\n“There is nothing for me, and there is everything for him because I have no choice as a woman, as a female in where I compete,” Turner told anchor John Roberts in a Fox News interview. “I am a woman, and I have an athletic disadvantage to men, so I compete in the women’s division, which is where I rightfully am, but he has been given this opportunity to fence in the women’s division.”\n\n“He can also compete at mixed events and local tournaments if he wants. There is a place for him,” Turner continued. \n\nTwo days later, a biological woman named Abigail Wilson also stormed off a disc golfing championship after seeing that a biological male posing as a female had entered the competition. \n\n“Females must be protected in our division!” Wilson yelled to the crowd in another viral video. “This is unfair. I refuse to play!”\n\nThis all comes after Trump signed an executive order to protect women in sports by banning men from competing in them regardless of how they identify. This was an easy decision for Trump, who campaigned on signing such an order while vowing to work with Congress to make it a national law. \n\nBut when a bill called the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act passed in the House largely along party lines when only a majority vote was needed, it was stopped in the Senate after every Democrat voted against it, falling short of the 60 votes needed to pass it in the chamber. \n\nThis will undoubtedly cost the party in 2026, just as it did for former Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats in 2024. A January New York Times/Ipsos poll found that only 18% of American adults said athletes “who were male at birth but who currently identify as female” should be allowed to compete in women’s sports. \n\nSo congratulations, Blue Team! You’re aligned with 18% of the public on an issue generating tons of attention. The attack ads ahead of the midterm elections will practically write themselves with receipts to back everything up. \n\nHere’s another question: Where is the alleged most popular woman in the world on this issue? \n\nAs recently as 2024, according to an expansive YouGov survey of 42,000 people in 41 countries, former first lady Michelle Obama was voted the most admired woman in the world. She also championed the Obama White House’s “Let’s Move!” campaign, which stressed physical fitness and healthy eating. \n\nBut when it comes to protecting women in sports, we haven’t heard a peep from her despite her new podcast, which gives her unlimited time and space to do so. \n\nThe same goes for former President Barack Obama, who will always find the time to post his March Madness men’s and women’s pools online and attend games but has nothing to say on this 80/20 issue. \n\nMegan Rapinoe, who was somehow awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by former President Joe Biden, has declared that she welcomes men in her sport of soccer. One problem: when Rapinoe’s U.S. women’s national team played an under-15 boys academy team, they were beaten soundly, 5-2. \n\nAgain, these boys were barely teenagers and defeated the defending women’s World Cup champions by three goals.\n\nAny questions on the biological advantage? \n\nThe hope is that the trend and sentiment continue to see more girls and women refuse to compete against men in situations where they know they can’t win. \n\nCONSERVATIVES RALLY BEHIND TRUMP’S PRO-TARIFF MANTRA: ‘DON’T BE A PANICAN’\n\nUnlike the Biden years, they know they have a president and public there to support them. \n\nAs for Democrats, until the far-left stops dictating policy, winning elections will be a losing proposition.","summary":"&#8220;Why was a boy allowed to play on the other team?&#8221; my fifth-grade daughter asked me as we walked off the field at a recent club soccer match.  Good question.

Her campaign rival-turned-Treasury Secretary Joanna (Elizabeth Marvel) once called her a “warmonger” and she’s later chastised as a “bulldozer,” but despite this apparent slander, her gung-ho bona fides are soon to come in handy. \n\nBefore she can show off her murderous stuff, however, she first must deal with teenage daughter Serena (Marsai Martin), who’s created a scandal by sneaking out of the White House—by hacking an RFID system—and doing shots at a Georgetown bar. This makes Danielle appear to be weak on security, and after being grounded, Serena sneers at her mom, “All you ever try to do is make yourself look good.”\n\nDavis’ POTUS is so obviously noble and kindhearted that these insults fail to dent her armor, and she’s soon traveling to Cape Town for the G20 summit, where she intends to introduce a plan for a new digital currency that will help ease a hunger crisis. She’s accompanied by her loyal husband Derek (Anthony Anderson) and greeted cooly by her compatriots, including British Prime Minister Oliver Everett (Douglas Hodge) and IMF bigwig Elena Romano (Sabrina Impacciatore). \n\nThings hit the fan when Rutledge (Antony Starr), the head of the private security firm hired to help safeguard the President, seizes control of the “impenetrable” hotel venue. In the immediate chaos, Danielle escapes the ballroom with Elena, South Korea’s First Lady, and her right-hand Secret Service agent Manny Ruize (Will Trent’s Ramón Rodriguez), and Derek protects Serena and her brother Demetrius (Christopher Farrar) in an upstairs hotel room.\n\nRutledge blabs on and on about America starting wars and exploiting other countries’ natural resources but it’s all just a smokescreen for his desire to send the world’s markets into free fall and to convince people to invest in crypto—a plot that will make him and his anonymous henchmen wealthy. \n\nTo facilitate this, he forces the G20 attendees to spout gibberish at a camera so he can create misleading deep fake videos. Yet the person he really needs to make this ruse work is Danielle, and she’s busy sneaking around kitchens, sliding down laundry chutes, and leaping into elevators to kill burly and heavily armed adversaries. This requires cutting her long red gown short and ditching her high heels for sneakers, because she’s no fancy pants; rather, she’s Kamala Harris via John McClaine, John-Wick, Rambo, and Harrison Ford’s Air Force One leader.\n\nDavis is a convincing warrior-politician in G20, and as he’s proven on The Boys, Starr has a knack for grinning maliciousness. Both go through insanely familiar paces courtesy of the script by Caitlin Parrish, Erica Weiss, Logan Miller, and Noah Miller, all as Serena—who, remember, is a sly tech genius—tries to access the roof’s satellite dish so she can create a secret connection to Washington to let the Vice President (Clark Gregg) know what’s going down. \n\nThe ensuing rescue mission by outside forces is stymied by the media’s decision to announce said operation to everyone (including Rutledge), but then, expecting anything less than abject nonsense from Riggen’s film is a recipe for disappointment. It’s better to simply accept the absurdity and go with the laughable flow.\n\nDuring her ordeal, Danielle kills a bunch of dudes, convinces scaredy-cat Oliver that her strength is actually awesome (he even likens her to Winston Churchill!), and does so many daringly murderous things that grouchy teen Serena ultimately has to admit, “She’s kind of a bada**, huh?” before confessing, “Mom, you are really something special.” \n\nThat she is, at least as far as G20 is concerned. Director Riggen handles her shootouts and hand-to-hand combat with dutiful efficiency, having her protagonist slay various baddies in ways that keep on-screen bloodshed to a minimum. RPG fire, explosions, flipping cars, and other genre hallmarks embellish the material, and at a late stage, Danielle is aided by two undercover South African agents who are so formidable that Demetrius exclaims, “You’re from Wakanda!”\n\nG20 offers a progressive 21st-century spin on a tried-and-true template, with Black women tasked with primary superhero duties (Anderson’s First Gentleman is, predictably, the material’s damsel in distress). Yet that’s just window dressing for a decidedly old-school venture in which meaningful personal and political change is affected via a knife and gun. \n\nRoutinely goofy, the film gets the job done on its own extremely limited terms, although it’s difficult to ignore the fact that, arriving at this particular moment in time, its conception of geopolitical good and evil doesn’t comport with reality—a notion that neuters some of its pleasures.\n\n“When you have the actions of a tyrant, no one’s gonna hear your voice,” says Danielle to Rutledge, and while that’s a nice idea, it rings hollow in the age of Trump 2.0. G20 is, in a certain sense, nothing more than a formulaic throwback about using power for the betterment of mankind. \n\nUnfortunately, it’s hampered by real-life events that are out of its control. Debuting in the midst of tremendous domestic upheaval in which America seems to be rewriting its values and reconfiguring its relationship to the world, the film—proffering a vision of courageous and selfless U.S. leadership that brings people and nations together—comes across as regrettably out of touch.","summary":"Prime StudiosG20 is a fairy tale from another era, employing every trick in the 1990s action playbook while imagining a Black female President who unites the world and saves her family through valiant a**-kicking. \n\nIts hero played with staunch resolve and humanity by Viola Davis, she’s the Mamala of all Mamalas, and Patricia Riggen’s Prime Video film, which is now streaming, puts her through the preposterous wringer, having her fend off greedy terrorists, put up with annoying allies, and protect her husband, children, and comrades from danger. \n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/g20-review-viola-davis-plays-kamala-harris-in-a-die-hard-movie/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/6D5TK56DFNCX5MLA72CJAG5ZRU.png?smart=true&auth=29241da1dc2a37c82e666f0fb0ea9d35bb55c50c9dfede28d12e8fe0d11b15b1&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 19:33:58","author":"Nick Schager","authors":["Nick Schager"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.293},{"id":309905512,"title":"EXCLUSIVE: Laura Loomer is going into business with an anonymous X user—who is @CcpSkipTracer?","text":"Laura Loomer’s X feed is a spray of accusations, claims, and barbs that are increasingly bubbling up at the highest levels of the Trump administration. \n\nBoth President Donald Trump and Elon Musk have shared Loomer’s work, pushing reports on alleged enemies and bias in government that the far-right influencer has hyped.\n\nBut she doesn’t work alone. \n\nLoomer has been aided by an anonymous researcher, operating behind an X account that lobs remarks about Chinese and Black politicians, public officials and their children, and prominent media figures. \n\nThe account’s proprietor isn’t a journalist or opposition research expert, but a middle-aged man from Long Island who has gone from reply guy to Loomer’s business partner. \n\nThe two just started a research firm, hoping to turn Loomer’s clout into an actual clientele. \n\nLast week, Loomer met with Trump in the Oval Office to present him with opposition research on National Security Council staffers she wanted removed for their alleged lack of loyalty to the former president. Some of the officials were subsequently fired. \n\nNow, according to a report in Politico, she is actively pitching her new firm to the White House, hoping to secure contracts to vet incoming staffers. Loomer told the Daily Dot the Trump officials have already come to her looking to use the firm. \n\nLoomer is a longtime divisive figure on the far-right, whose access to Trump has been the subject of controversy over the last year. \n\nLately, she’s been focused on the backlash to Tesla, attempting to tie the protest movement and acts of vandalism to the work of moneyed Democratic activists. \n\nAnd Musk has enthusiastically responded to her efforts. \n\nThe DOGE head recently quoted a post of hers that identified an anti-Tesla activist as behind one of a series of protests across the country, claiming the effort was an attempt to sink Tesla’s stock. \n\n“His track record,” Loomer said, flagging his prior reporting on Tesla, “begs the question, who is paying [him].“\n\nIn response to a Fox News story on Musk pushing the astroturf claims, the activist wrote on Bluesky, “this is the longest possible headline for ‘world’s richest man tweets some bullshit.’”\n\nThe activist’s name was part of a lengthy list from Loomer and her business partner identifying who she thought was behind each protest. \n\n“LIST AND ORGANIZER DETAILS COMPILED BY @LauraLoomer @CcpSkipTracer @LoomerUnleashed,” she wrote. \n\nTogether, Loomer and CcpSkipTracer have created an X Community, a moderated group to “monitor & document all domestic terror attempts to vandalize @Tesla Showrooms,” sharing videos of people allegedly vandalizing Teslas as members attempt to identify alleged perpetrators. \n\nLoomer has long cited CcpSkipTracer, who she has worked with on research to discredit another Trump judge for his family’s politics, call out Democratic activists and politicians, and shame businesses for liberal positions. \n\nThe Daily Dot has determined the person behind the CcpSkipTracer account is a Long Island, New York native named Eric Silverstein. \n\nA recent business filing for Loomer’s new opposition research firm, Loomered Strategies, shows Silverstein’s name on the company’s Montana LLC registration, along with Loomer, listing the address of his Long Island home. \n\nThe address happens to be near X CEO Linda Yaccarino’s house, a boast CcpSkipTracer has repeatedly noted on his account. \n\nOther identifying details exist online, including identical photos of a dog posted by CcpSkipTracer and Facebook photos from a woman married to an “Eric” online. \n\nImages posted by “Eric’s” wife on Facebook also match images of a home and Teslas shared by CcpSkipTracer online. \n\nAnd in a recent video discussing CcpSkipTracer’s appearance at a Tesla protest, Loomer called him “Eric.”\n\nThe two confirmed Silverstein as being behind CcpSkipTracer and as Loomer’s new “business partner.”\n\n“I’ve known Eric for several years, and he had, you know, an anonymous, online identity,” Loomer said. “But now that the election is over, we’ve decided to partner in a public venture.”\n\nThe duo appears to have first worked together during Trump’s New York business fraud case, where Loomer shared an image in March 2024 from what she alleged was the Twitter account of the daughter of the trial’s judge, Juan Merchan, which had a photoshopped image of Trump behind bars as its avatar. \n\nHer post included four screenshots. \n\nJust 14 minutes before she shared them, CcpSkipTracer tagged Loomer with those same four images, re-upping claims of bias by the judge given Merchan’s daughter’s work with Democratic marketing firms, news previously reported by the Gateway Pundit. \n\n“Imagine if her father was the judge,” the account wrote. \n\nLoomer says the two worked together on the scoop. \n\n“We work on stories together, so when I’m working on a story, or I’ve uncovered a story, my staff collaborate with me on my stories,” she said of CcpSkipTracer’s post.\n\n“EXCLUSIVE BOMBSHELL,” Loomer captioned her own tweet, sharing the images. “An X account belonging to Loren Merchan …. shows her profile picture is President Trump behind bars in a jail cell.”\n\nBut the account wasn’t Merchan’s daughter’s. A new account, using the old handle, with a unique user ID, was created days after the Gateway Pundit’s reporting. \n\nBreitbart, covering the story, had noted the original account had been deleted, leaving it available to grab\n\nIt only contained several retweets highlighting Merchan’s Democratic ties, as well as the “scandalous” avatar.\n\nThe court later agreed with reports debunking the claim.\n\n“The X, formerly Twitter, account being attributed to Judge Merchan’s daughter no longer belongs to her since she deleted it approximately a year ago … It represents the reconstitution, last April, and manipulation of an account she long ago abandoned.” \n\n“Follow: @LoomerUnleashed @CcpSkipTracer Investigative Unit,” Loomer concluded in her post. \n\nCcpSkipTracer then became a regular fixture in her posts and other media, appearing anonymously on her Loomer Unleashed Rumble show.\n\nThe two haven’t stopped going after judges presiding over Trump cases, a recurring theme of the duo’s reporting. \n\nA little after midnight on March 17, CcpSkipTracer replied to a viral complaint about Judge James Boasberg, who is overseeing the Trump administration’s deportation cases, saying “Boasberg should be exposed, in the morning.” \n\nThat day, Loomer revealed a big ”EXCLUSIVE” on the daughter of Boasberg, noting she worked for a public defenders association and has pronouns in her bio. “She goes by SHE/HER, proving her affiliation with the Left.” \n\nTrump appeared to allude to Loomer’s work later, mentioning Boasberg’s “disqualifying family conflicts”\n\nLately, Loomer and CcpSkipTracer are focused on protests against Tesla, despite both recently having it out for the tech CEO. \n\nLoomer and Musk briefly feuded in January over H-1B1 visas, as Loomer claimed the program, which Musk backed, broke with Trump’s hardline immigration policy. \n\nAnd CcpSkipTracer, though he owned a number of Teslas, wasn’t happy with Musk’s X takeover. \n\n“I love my Cybertruck, but I’m requesting that @tesla grant me permission to sell it. As an American, my First Amendment rights are more important than a pickup truck. My neighbor @lindayaX continues to limit and censor my freedom of speech. Hopefully @elonmusk can eventually create a social media platform, without censorship,” he wrote in 2024. \n\nBut the two have changed their tune as Tesla has become a proxy tool in the left’s push against DOGE. \n\nSilverstein said that Musk proved himself to the world.\n\n“I had some mixed feelings about Elon Musk, initially. However, he’s proven himself to basically the world. He put himself on the line. He’s really surprised me and I’m very impressed.” \n\n“It transcends personal feelings,” Loomer added of the work, noting her previous spat.\n\nMusk has repeatedly engaged with several Loomer posts about the protests.\n\nOn March 9, Loomer posted her and CcpSkipTracer’s shared findings about a New York City Tesla protest, questioning the finances behind it. Musk replied with two exclamation marks at 2 am to Loomer’s post.\n\nLater that month, Loomer posted a clip of Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D-Texas) on a Tesla Takedown mass call, saying her birthday wish was for Musk to be taken down. \n\n“Wow,” Musk opined.\n\nAs acts of vandalism and public protest increase, Loomer and CcpSkipTracer have been crowdsourcing information, trying to identify protesters. \n\nThe Tesla Takedown Watch group is now home to almost 3,000 members, where they post alleged acts of vandalism against Tesla.\n\n“Let’s find her,” “Make this mom famous,” wrote users in the group about a video that showed a woman possibly keying a Tesla, sharing images of what they thought was her work ID badge and posting screenshots of her children. \n\nCcpSkipTracer also personally visited a Long Island protest on March 15 in a Tesla, filming the trip for Loomer Unleashed.\n\nAfter being booed by the protesters, the account wrote, “I promptly retreated to a secure, private location, donned a mask, and allowed myself a moment of emotional release.”\n\nLoomer posted CcpSkipTracer’s photos of the protesters, mocking their looks.\n\nCcpSkipTracer accused the protest of being a coordinated action by “paid agitators,” saying he, “observed consistent rhetoric regarding the suggestion that @elonmusk should return to South Africa. It appears that the attendees may be adhering to a shared narrative or coordinated messaging.”\n\nAn attendee at that protest denied to the Daily Dot that they were paid to attend: “I wish I got paid to protest as I’m a broke struggling filmmaker living in [New York], but I don’t need to be paid to stand up for others … I’m from Long Island and I definitely was not paid and there were at least a hundred other Long Islanders out there that day who also weren’t paid and I’m sure would be willing to prove it as well.”\n\nNow, Loomer and CcpSkipTracer are riding their wave of Tesla stories into a new venture.\n\n“Excited to announce I’ve launched my own opposition research firm called LOOMERED STRATEGIES. Loomered Strategies is your go to, bi-partisan firm for Executive Level vetting, opposition research and intelligence, rapid response, & your opponent’s worst nightmare,” she posted on March 24.\n\nThe CcpSkipTracer account has Loomered Strategies tagged in its X bio. While Silverstein is listed on the corporate registration, Loomer has not publicly mentioned Silverstein or CcpSkipTracer’s role in the venture. However, the X account for Loomered Strategies follows just five people: Musk, Loomer, Loomer Unleashed, an election monitoring start-up CEO, and CcpSkipTracer.\n\nThe two hope to attract a range of clients from across the political spectrum. “What’s wrong with being bi-partisan? Loomered Strategies will cater to people of all persuasions who want the best intel,” Loomer wrote on March 25.\n\nLoomer said she hoped she might pick up “moderate” Democrats as clients, who wished for their radical left primary opponents to be exposed. \n\n“We’re both very passionate about research,” Loomer said of the new partnership. “And it’s a skill that people are going to need. It’s a skill that politicians need, business executives need. And there’s a vetting crisis on both sides of the political aisle in our country. And so, you know, I wanted to launch an opposition research firm, and Eric is my business partner.”\n\nPotential clients, though, may not be as bipartisan as Loomer wishes, given her and CcpSkipTracer’s past takes. \n\nCcpSkipTracer has posted about China hundreds of times. The account repeatedly made hyperbolic jokes that the solution to COVID-19 is to drop a nuclear bomb on China, called for the “obliteration of China” several times, and once wrote, “Chinese people = the silent and deadly enemy amongst us.” \n\nWhen asked about the comments, Silverstein said to refer to his more recent posts. \n\n“Chinese Americans are the most patriotic Americans amongst us. However, Chinese nationals are a different story, and that’s exactly how I feel,” he added. \n\nCcpSkipTracer has also expressed offensive views about Black Americans, calling Kamala Harris a “DEI VP” and other black politicians like Crockett and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass as “DEI Shaniquas.” \n\nAfter Crockett feuded with a Loomer correspondent, CcpSkipTracer said she was “a feral animal and belongs in a cage.”\n\nWhen asked about the posts, Loomer said, “It’s called having a sense of humor … I think we both called [Crockett] DEI Shaniqua.”\n\nPosts of his also concern criminal suspects, calling out police and media stations for not IDing suspects with their race.\n\nBut while possibly offputting to future clients who aren’t MAGA, CcpSkipTracer’s fiery takes are right in line with Loomer’s own personal posting. \n\nLoomer drew controversy last year for her comments that the White House would “smell like curry,” if former Vice President Kamala Harris won the 2024 election. \n\nShe has also famously celebrated the deaths of Muslim refugees, and often speaks in what she considers an impersonation of Black Americans on her show.\n\nBut the two are enthusiastic about the venture. \n\n“Laura is one of the most hard-working people I’ve ever encountered,” Silverstein said, “and she’s extremely thorough and very articulate, and she’s a very honorable journalist, and … we work very well with our opposition research, that’s why I decided to go into business with Laura.”\n\n“It’s hard to find people who … have shared common, but also have a shared work ethic,” Loomer said. “We are aligned on many fronts, and we believe that we can collectively transform the world of opposition research and vetting.”\n\nInternet culture is chaotic—but we’ll break it down for you in one daily email.

He vowed repeatedly during his presidential campaign to target his critics and political rivals and has taken several actions in recent months to do so.Cheney, who represented Wyoming, became one of Trump's most prominent critics following the 2020 election and the January 6, 2021, pro-Trump riot at the U.S. Capitol. She voted to impeach Trump along with nine other Republicans afterward.What To KnowFollowing Trump's signing of the order, Cheney re-posted a clip of the president's remarks about his new action, and rebuked the move.\"In a special mix of incompetence and evil, Trump has combined his disastrous implementation of 1930s tariff policies with Stalinesque targeting of political adversaries. The 2020 election wasn't stolen and speaking the truth is only a crime in countries ruled by tyrants,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter.In his comments, Trump described Krebs sarcastically as a \"wise guy,\" claiming that the 2020 election was a \"disaster.\"Krebs served as the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) in Trump's first administration and worked to counter the president's false claims that he won the 2020 election. Shortly after the election, Krebs' agency released a statement, saying \"the November 3rd election was the most secure in American history.\"Trump fired Krebs a few days later and continued to insist that the election had been \"stolen\" in favor of Joe Biden.Numerous independent audits and reviews in critical swing states have consistently countered Trump's characterization. Dozens of legal challenges brought by Trump and his allies also failed in court, including when reviewed by judges appointed by the Republican president.January 6 and Cheney's Opposition To TrumpOn January 6, 2021, hundreds of Trump's supporters rioted at the U.S. Capitol, believing that the election was stolen. While the riot temporarily delayed the 2020 election's formal certification, Biden was inevitably confirmed as the winner in a joint session of Congress.Trump was impeached on January 13, 2021, by the House, with Cheney backing the effort. The Senate ultimately acquitted Trump, falling short of the two-thirds majority required for a conviction. However, a majority of senators, including five Republicans, voted to convict, with the final tally 57-43.Cheney went on to be one of two Republicans who served on the House select committee that carried out an investigation of the events of January 6, as well as Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election. In response, Trump backed a primary challenger, to whom Cheney lost in the 2022 midterms.The president previously said that Cheney should be jailed for her stand against him. He has threatened to target her and others involved with the January 6 investigation, but Biden issued a preemptive pardon for her and the other involved lawmakers right before leaving office in January.Cheney endorsed and campaigned for former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. After Trump's win, the Republican wrote on X:\"Our nation's democratic system functioned last night and we have a new President-elect. All Americans are bound, whether we like the outcome or not, to accept the results of our elections. We now have a special responsibility, as citizens of the greatest nation on earth, to do everything we can to support and defend our Constitution, preserve the rule of law, and ensure that our institutions hold over these coming four years.\"What People Are SayingRepublican political strategist Sarah Longwell to MSNBC on Wednesday on Trump's executive order: \"This is some of the most insane authoritarian stuff we've seen out of him.\"Chris Krebs wrote in a December 2020 op-ed in The Washington Post: \"The 2020 election was the most secure in U.S. history. This success should be celebrated by all Americans, not undermined in the service of a profoundly un-American goal.\"Political strategist Tim Miller, a former Republican, on MSNBC on Wednesday: \"Trump wants to continue to argue that he really won in 2020... He's going after Chris Krebs for doing his job the right way.\"What Happens NextTrump's executive order on Wednesday followed a string of orders by the president targeting law firms and individuals involved in investigations or legal actions against him, including revoking security clearances and suspending federal contracts. While some have settled, others are mounting legal challenges, setting the stage for a broader legal and constitutional clash.","summary":"The former Republican congresswoman described Trump's executive order as \"a special mix of incompetence and evil.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/liz-cheney-issues-new-brutal-rebuke-donald-trump-2058201","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2625132/liz-cheney.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 18:58:29","author":"Jason Lemon","authors":["Jason Lemon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.275},{"id":309871732,"title":"Kamala Harris offered to help vs. Trump, but Dems said, ‘No thanks’","text":"If you were unaware that former Vice President Kamala Harris had a role in trying to help Democrats clinch a Wisconsin Supreme Court race that was seen as a litmus test for President Donald Trump, you’re probably not alone.\n\nAccording to a new report from The New York Times, Harris made the “rare move” to speak “by Zoom on the eve of the April 1 Wisconsin Supreme Court election to about 100 Democratic workers and organizers in the state, praising their efforts on her campaign and ahead of the judicial contest.”","summary":"\"Harris looks for a way back in.\"","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2025/04/kamala-harris-offered-to-help-vs-trump-but-dems-said-no-thanks.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/YVKHUOC35VFJNO656YOGJBPP6U.jpg?auth=fb28312cf6bb1de911394ab5a7b3c9e30386b66506552233471c9c71f60de3d8&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 18:33:38","author":"Matt Arco","authors":["Matt Arco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.586},{"id":309851998,"title":"Tim Walz heckled by veterans for stolen valor claims, China connections","text":"Veterans heckled Gov.

You sympathize with the Chinese!\" some veterans holding American flags and \"take action\" signs shouted at the Democratic governor as he welcomed them to the Capitol. \"Sir, you're welcome to come… Let me finish!\" Walz replied as he tried to ease tensions while another veteran shouted: \"Shut your f------ mouth!\" WISCONSINITES KICKED OUT AND DENIED ENTRY TO THIS DEMOCRAT'S 'FAKE TOWN HALL' \"Woah, hey – there’s some passion in the building, which is a good thing,\" Walz said before beginning his address. VETERANS INCREASINGLY CALLING OUT WALZ'S MILITARY RECORD: 'SHAMEFUL' Footage of the hecklers disrupting Walz's remarks has gone viral on social media, with conservative influencers celebrating the criticism. Walz faced accusations of stolen valor during the 2024 presidential election for inconsistencies describing his military service. Walz is a veteran, having served in the Minnesota National Guard’s 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery after transferring from the Nebraska National Guard in 1996. He retired as a master sergeant in 2005. The former vice presidential candidate was accused of stolen valor for retiring just months before his battalion deployed to Iraq as war raged in the Middle East following the 9/11 attacks. Walz put in his papers for retirement at least five months before his battalion received deployment orders, according to the Minnesota National Guard. Walz was also discovered to have claimed several times that he retired as a command sergeant major, which is not accurate – he reverted to his previous rank upon retirement because he did not complete the necessary corresponding coursework, the National Guard has said. Walz's decades-long ties to China also came to light when Vice President Kamala Harris picked him as her running mate last summer. He worked briefly in China as a teacher, traveling to Guangdong in 1989 for a teaching-abroad program to teach English and American history. He was initially believed to have made dozens of trips to China over his lifetime, but a campaign spokesperson later tried to walk that number back and said he made approximately 15 visits to China. He also boasted about Minnesota hosting several top Chinese leaders in a letter unearthed by Fox News Digital. UNEARTHED LETTER REVEALS WALZ BOASTED ABOUT MINNESOTA HOSTING 'NUMEROUS SENIOR CHINESE LEADERS' The 2024 campaign trail brought Walz's inconsistencies regarding his background into the national conversation. Walz said he \"misspoke\" when he claimed he visited Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and incorrectly claimed his family used in vitro fertilization. Walz laughed off the missteps, calling himself a \"knucklehead.\" The Commanders' Task Force and Minnesota Association of County Veterans Service Officers hosted the rally in the Rotunda that erupted in boos for Walz on Wednesday. The annual event is designed to streamline communication between Minnesota elected officials and veterans.

Walz did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.","summary":"Veterans at the Minnesota State Capitol called Gov.

The tennis legend called on Democrats to \"grow a spine\" in a post on social media. Trump signed the executive order in February and Navratilova lamented that Democrats failed to do what the president did. \"I hate that the Democrats totally failed women and girls on this very clear issue of women’s sports being for females only,\" she wrote in a post on X. High school organizations in Maine, California and Washington have all failed to change policies that currently allow transgender athletes to participate in girls’ and women’s sports. CALIFORNIA GIRL OPENS UP ON FIGHTING LEGAL AND POLITICAL BATTLE OVER TRANS ATHLETES AFTER LIFE-CHANGING PAIN Meanwhile, Democratic lawmakers like Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Jasmine Crockett of Texas have downplayed the issue, even as Trump campaigned on it and soundly defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the general election. Ocasio-Cortez mentioned the overall subject of Democratic support for the trans community during an interview on \"The Weekly Show with Jon Stewart\" podcast on Jan. 23. \"When we allow ourselves to constantly be distracted by these culture wars around trans people, it's a new thing every day, and the answer isn't that we just let those people be attacked, it's that we say, ‘What are you doing, man?’ I think we need to make standing up for those folks just such an afterthought that it's not even a debate,\" Ocasio-Cortez said. \"Like, we need to understand and see the bait for what it is, but we don’t take the bait by letting those rights just erode and go by the wayside.\" Ocasio-Cortez has previously voted in favor of multiple bills that would enable trans athletes to play in women's and girls' sports nationwide, including the Equality Act and the Transgender Bill of Rights. She also claimed on Jan. 14 that the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act would empower child sexual predators and that \"trans girls are girls.\" In an interview with The 19th, Crockett dismissed the topic of trans inclusion in women's and girls' sports as a \"distraction,\" while minimizing the potential impact they've had on the lives of women and families. Crockett made the comments while criticizing Democrats for becoming divided on the issue. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"In this election, we allowed ourselves to be divided.

So it’s no surprise his new book, “Pronoun Trouble: The Story of Us in Seven Little Words,” hits shelves as its subject makes constant, contentious headlines.\n\nBut that’s not how he planned it.\n\n“I have a pattern, which is that often, if I write an angry book I want to write a fun language-nerd book afterwards, just to lighten things up,” the Columbia prof and podcaster tells The Post.\n\n“Woke Racism: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America,” his 2021 bestseller, “was an angry little book that I needed to write. But after that’s over, you’ve got this ashtray-taste in your mouth.”\n\nThe New York Times — where McWhorter is a weekly columnist — complained just Tuesday that after President Trump “barred federal workers from listing their preferred pronouns in email signatures,” his “press aides have refused to engage with reporters’ questions because the journalists listed identifying pronouns in their email signatures.”\n\n“Pronoun Trouble” has arrived at the perfect moment.\n\n“Sitting on a sunporch in 2023, I was not expecting Trump to win again,” its author says. “I had no idea that a couple of years later, we would be caught up in these much-thornier debates about trans.”\n\nHe laughs, “I’m just trying to roll with it, but originally I was just trying to write a fun, happy book to offset the bitterness of ‘Woke Racism.’”\n\nWhile that book won the linguist more fans and fame, progressives hated it — and McWhorter’s work for the center-right Manhattan Institute. \n\nConservatives won’t like his case for the singular “they” in “Pronoun Trouble.” But McWhorter is anything but a black-and-white thinker (no pun intended).\n\n“Words are going to change sometimes. We all dealt with ‘Oriental’ became ‘Asian,’ and we are much less likely now to say ‘stewardess’ rather than ‘flight attendant,’” he says.\n\nBut the singular “they”: “That’s brand new. Very very sudden. The problem is when anybody from either side tries to propose an entire list all at one time. That’s what happened from the woke left in 2020 and 2021, and now we have something similar coming from what we’re beginning appropriately to call the woke right, which is, ‘Don’t use these words.’”\n\nNew names don’t mean new thinking, he points out.\n\n“I understand why we’re being taught now to say ‘unhoused’ because ‘homeless’ has taken on a kind of a seamy air. But I’m also old enough to remember when ‘homeless’ was introduced because that sounded more humane than saying ‘bum’ or ‘tramp,’” he says. \n\n“Homeless was a beautiful, elegant, humane term. But the thing is ‘unhoused’ is going to sound the same way ‘homeless’ does now in about 20 years. Really, what we need to change is how many people are ‘unhoused.’ So in general, the idea is to change thought and reality not to change the way people say things.”\n\nIndeed, enforcing language is easier than working for real change, McWhorter says.\n\n“It’s a lazy form of activism, whichever side it comes from. I think we need to get back to the idea of politics as going out and doing things and making a case for things rather than saying, ‘Don’t say that.’”\n\nPronouns’ ubiquity in progressives’ email signatures and social-media bios is yet another form of virtue signaling.\n\n“That has become a way of quietly indicating that you are a certain kind of enlightened person,” McWhorter says. \n\n“There was a time when men wore top hats to indicate membership in a certain group. Even today, the clothes that you wear, what radio stations you listen to, if any, what books you have on your shelf. So for example, in my world, it is very common to have a copy of Robert Caro’s ‘The Power Broker’ very prominently displayed on your shelf. And I’m not saying people haven’t read it, but you have a way of having that one in a place that everyone can see, and I would say that I’m not different. My copy of ‘The Power Broker” — and I did read it — is somewhere where anybody who walks in can see it. That’s a way of showing I’m a certain kind of educated person.”\n\nListing pronouns, however, is one signal McWhorter would never send. And that Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez deleted hers from her Twitter bio after the 2024 election sends its own signal.\n\n“It was showing that the major high wokeness of 2020-2021 is on the ropes,” he says. \n\nPronoun-listing “has a smell of the hard woke left. To the extent that Trump or Trump’s people had that nasty but truly clever sign, which was ‘Donald Trump is for you. Kamala Harris is for them.’ That’s nasty, but it’s also very effective.”\n\n“It made sense” AOC dropped the “she/her” after the Democrats’ defeat.\n\n“An era is over in terms of the worst of the woke left,” he concludes. “That’s a kind of person and ideology that will always be with us in some way, and I think it should be, but there’s an extreme that I think will pass.”\n\nMcWhorter’s tolerance of the woke left might be surprising, given his important work on its own intolerance. But he’s a John Stuart Mill-type liberal — open exchange is how human beings learn and improve society.\n\n“We need voices from the hard left to expand our sense of what’s possible, to expand our sense of what should be possible, or what we might be thinking about,” he says. \n\n“That’s how new ideas get out. What was inappropriate was that kind of person standing up at the table and insisting everybody go their way on the pain of being embarrassed in public and losing their job. That was not the way a mature society operates. But no, I’m all for the hard left being one of our voices, as long as the hard left listens to everybody else, just like everybody else listens to them.”\n\nWould he say that about the hard right?\n\n“Yes, definitely, as long as they just stay seated with everybody else,” he responds. “I grew up and I live in a context in which I’m trained to viscerally resist anything from the hard right, but then again, I also know intellectually that there are things from the hard right that make sense.”\n\nAsked for an example, he pauses some time before answering — he can be careful that way.\n\n“I don’t want to get in trouble,” he says with a chuckle.\n\n“OK, somebody from that world might say that there should be no such thing in admissions or in employment as acknowledging people’s hardships and lowering standards at all. So even if it’s not about race, I would say if somebody has had obstacles, then you adjust for that when evaluating whether or not they should have a shot at Harvard, whether or not they should get certain kinds of jobs. I say that partly because it makes perfect sense to me. I say it partly because it’s all I’ve ever heard. I say it partly because I know it’s what I’m supposed to say.”\n\nMcWhorter grew up in Philadelphia and has degrees from Rutgers, New York University and Stanford.\n\n“A person from the hard right might say that there should be no adjustments whatsoever, and that whole idea that you adjust — it starts in about 1966 — was a mistake, that it’s more trouble than it’s worth,” he continues. “Make it be about a test, as if we were in an East Asian country. And frankly, people who don’t do well will just get better at it, because there’s no other way.”\n\nMcWhorter shakes his head. “I find that heartless and unnecessary, but that is something someone should be allowed to say without being thrown out on the dirt because, really, a society might run more smoothly based on that.”\n\nHe’s on leave this year from Columbia, where he strongly feels anti-Israel protests have gone too far: “Jews are supposed to be able to suck up horrible things being said about them and Israel, day in and day out, because Jews are white.”\n\nBut he noticed a disturbing student trend earlier, post-COVID: the mumbling.\n\n“It started when the masks finally came off. I had to start and I had to keep on asking people to repeat themselves, like, ‘What, what?’ And I thought, I’m not that old. My hearing is just fine. A lot of the guys mumble, and I think that the reason they mumble more than they used to is because they spent a formative period of time having their whole social life be online, where you don’t really have to speak up. And so they never learned how to do this. And so I am now prepared for the undergraduate males to sound vaguely like they’re speaking Swedish,” he says (talking to The Post in a Swedish café). “Girls are more precise in their speech usually.”\n\nHe can’t help but recall his own daughters, though, as he considers his two roles — academic linguist who chronicles changing usage without judgment and opinionated commentator.\n\n“In listening to my 10- and my 13-year-old saying ‘like’ every five words, I must admit . . . I wish sometimes they wouldn’t use it so much. And I had told them, ‘If you’re ever in formal circumstances, like speaking up in class, you need to say ‘like’ less,” he reveals.\n\n“Frankly, there’s a little bit of snobbery,” he confesses. “I’m thinking, ‘How dare they sound like other people.’ But I know that does not make any logical sense. So yeah, the humanity does slip out” from the academic in the ivory tower, he chuckles.","summary":"Self-described “contrarian” John McWhorter is used to being at the center of controversy.

Really? For two decades we all watched how Chuck Todd could dry-hump anything — even the trivial — into a national narrative, so where was all the dry-humping over something this consequential?\n\nTodd reminds me of Jake Tapper writing a book about the Biden cover-up as though these videos do not exist.\n\nThe first time I heard Todd question Biden’s mental acuity was after Biden’s disastrous debate with Trump last year. Only after that train wreck did the corporate media realize the jig was up. They could no longer cover up the truth that Biden belonged in a Memory Care Unit. And so, and for the same reason they engaged in the cover-up, they ended the cover-up: to defeat Trump by pushing Biden out of the race.\n\nAnd it was only in that environment — weeks after the debate and ten days before Biden dropped out — that Chuck Todd and Politico’s Jonathan Martin had a high-old time yukking it up over how everyone has known for years that Biden was in no shape to draw a clock, much less run the free world:\n\nChuck Todd: I’m not going to out the cabinet secretary, but I had a cabinet secretary two years ago— okay, two years ago, out of the blue ask me: ‘Do you really think he can—he can’t run again like this.’ And I said, ‘You have more interaction that I do’ and he said, ‘I don’t have a lot of interaction with him.’ This is a pretty senior cabinet secretary and this was two years ago. This is one of those classic open secrets—nonversation, right? It’s the story everybody knows and everybody was afraid to talk about.\n\nTodd knew and refused to tell us, refused to report the truth as the administration and his own (former) networks (NBC and MSNBC) gaslighted the public with horseshit about “cheap fakes” and our lying eyes.\n\nAh, but now that Todd is a free agent, he has released another truth we all knew to be true…\n\n“We were subtle,” Todd says defending the regime media. “’Hey, he’s using the back staircase, not the front staircase. Hey, he’s not doing any interviews.’”\n\nRemember, the media are only subtle when it comes to shielding Democrats. This institution is so rotted, corrupt, and irredeemable, that the way Trump held a water glass received more screaming attention.\n\nAnd what does “not doing any interviews” have to do with anything other than “not doing any interviews?” When you don’t tell us why Biden’s not doing interviews when you hide the fact for YEARS — as Chuck Todd has admitted doing — that no less than a cabinet secretary told you he feared Biden was incapable of running for reelection, and when you only reveal what that cabinet secretary told you when it suits your far-left political agenda to replace Biden with someone who can beat Trump, you fool no one.\n\nNow we get to the beauty of beauties…\n\n“But I understand the argument about the collective [media] on that front,” Todd says of the cover-up he eagerly participated in. “The only thing I can chalk it up to is this … fear that some members of the media had sometimes that they would be perceived as helping Trump if they somehow diminished Biden… And I think this has been a fundamental mistake that many members of the traditional press has done.”\n\nDING! DING! DING! DING!\n\nThere it is… A full confession…\n\nRather than report a truth, and not just any truth, but a consequential truth about the sitting president’s mental incapacity, the “traditional media” will choose to lie to the public rather than help Trump, or be perceived in their toxic little clique of helping Trump.\n\nThat’s coming straight from an insider-insider, no less than the guy who hosted Meet the Press for years.\n\nAnd this is why no one should ever believe anything the regime media report. Given a choice between lying and helping Trump, they will always lie.\n\nLook at the 2020 presidential election… I’m telling you right now, and in his own way so is Chuck Todd, that if the “traditional media” knew for a fact and had evidence proving beyond any doubt that cheating put Joe Biden in the White House, the media would still lie and tell us there was no cheating.\n\nChuck Todd and Jake Tapper should write a book about all this titled “If I Did It.”\n\nAnd then they should marry the person they love most, themselves, and change their pronouns to “Who?” and “Me?”\n\nZero honor.\n\nPosting this for the lulz:\n\nBlack Newborns Much More Likely to Die If Doc’s White Hoax\nElon Musk Nazi Salute Hoax\nMass Hysterectomies Performed on Immigrants Hoax\nThe All-White Trump Party Hoax\nSpringfield Bomb Threat Hoax\nTrump Called for Liz Cheney to Be Executed Hoax\nViolent Crime Down Under Biden/Harris Hoax\nArlington Cemetery Hoax\nKamala Was Never America’s Border Czar Hoax\nRussia Collusion Hoax\nHands Up, Don’t Shoot Hoax\nJussie Smollett Hoax\nCovington KKKids Hoax\nVery Fine People Hoax\nSeven-Hour Gap Hoax\nRussian Bounties Hoax\nTrump Trashes Troops Hoax\nPolicemen Killed at Mostly Peaceful January 6 Protest Hoax\nRittenhouse Hoax\nEating While Black Hoax\nBorder Agents Whipping Illegals Hoax\nNASCAR Noose Hoax\nGeorgia Jim Crow 2.0 Hoax\nTrump Assaulted Secret Service Agents and Grabbed Steering Wheel of Beast Hoax\nMAGA Assaulted Paul Pelosi Hoax\nCOVID Lab Leak Theory Is Racist Hoax\nHunter Biden’s Laptop Is Russian Disinformation Hoax\nJoe Biden Will Never Ban Gas Stoves Hoax\nCOVID Deaths are Overcounted Is a Conspiracy Theory Hoax\nMass Graves of Native Children in Canada Hoax\nTrump Killed Japanese Koi Fish Hoax\nTrump Told People to Drink Bleach Hoax\nHamas Hospital Hoax\nIf Reelected, Trump Will Execute People Hoax\nThe 900,000 Kids Hospitalized with Coronavirus Hoax\nDozens of Environmental Hoaxes\nThe Alfa Bank Hoax\nLibs of TikTok Murdered Non-Binary Teen Hoax\nAaron Rodgers Sandy Hook-Truther Hoax\n‘Bloodbath’ Hoax\nBiden ‘Sharp-as-a-Tack’ Hoax\nIowa Poll Hoax\n\nThe media are beyond redemption.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

Recent events in my hometown of Vancouver and across North America call this warning to mind today.\n\nOn April 5 in Vancouver, a municipal special election saw two candidates from the more or less left end of the political spectrum, Sean Orr of the Coalition of Progressive Electors (COPE) and Lucy Maloney of the NDP-adjacent One City party, elected to city council, a result that represents a stern voters’ rebuke to the developer-friendly regime of Mayor Ken Sim and his ABC party.\n\nThis is, broadly speaking, good news for workers and their allies in Vancouver, but a closer look suggests the results also imply some hard questions about the uses and misuses of labour solidarity.\n\nFirst of all, it is notable that the Vancouver and District Labour Council (VDLC for short – an umbrella group of BC Fed affiliated unions in BC’s Lower Mainland) endorsed only one of the two progressive candidates who won. Instead of endorsing COPE’s Sean Orr, the VDLC endorsed Green Party candidate Annette Reilly, who only managed to rack up just over 15,000 votes, compared to Sean Orr’s first place 34,448 and the 33,732 votes won by Maloney.\n\nSome observers will wonder if the VDLC endorsement of a Green candidate over the COPE candidate reflected nervousness about Orr’s history of involvement with Vote Socialist and Democratic Socialists of Vancouver or left over rancor stemming from earlier conflicts about election strategy between COPE and the VDLC. In any event, it left the VDLC, an important voice for BC workers, only half correct in its endorsements.\n\nWhile most observers would see a vote for a Green candidate as less harmful than a vote for Sim’s ‘Always Befriend the Capitalists’ party, the class politics of the Green Party remain murky, and no one will be tempted to see the local Greens as reds. In balance, the VDLC decision to endorse Reily when a more genuinely pro-worker candidate like COPE’s Orr was available was unfortunate.\n\nA union voice that endorsed both the progressive winners in the Vancouver byelection was heard from UniteHere, Local 40, which urged the election of both Orr and Maloney.\n\nIn addition to getting points for electoral prescience, Local 40 has, more importantly, racked up several impressive bargaining victories in the Vancouver area recently, illustrating the importance of solidarity.\n\nRead more: Big win for hotel workers in BC illustrates important lessons\n\nIn a November 21, 2024 press release, UniteHere Local 40 said that its members at Hyatt Regency, Westin Bayshore, and Pinnacle Waterfront will enjoy a cumulative raise of 34 per cent by 2027. Under the new agreement, a room attendant will earn nearly $32.50 per hour on January 1 and will make over $37 per hour in 2027. The improved wages won by militant struggle of a workforce that is typically female and brown compare favorably with this year’s calculated Living Family Wage minimum of $27.05 for this year.\n\nThe hotel workers followed up this impressive win by resolving a strike that ran for almost four years (the longest worker strike in Canadian history) and pitted the scrappy local against international hotel giant Radisson.\n\nThis victory was won by the tough, ongoing solidarity of Local 40 members and by support from community members, both within and without the labour movement.\n\nThe gains won are considerable. According to a statement from Local 40:\n\n“All former Pacific Gateway workers terminated during the pandemic have the right to return based on seniority; right of recall extends for 36 months;\nHighest hotel wages in Vancouver Airport/Richmond market; returning room attendants will earn up to $28.25/hour; returning cooks will earn up to $32.50/hour;\nNo rollbacks on wages, benefits and working conditions. Contract gains include medical benefit improvements with lower eligibility requirements; new personal days; and sick days that may be carried over, and other benefits;\nThe agreement adopts industry leading standards such as daily room cleaning to ensure high sanitation standards for guests and safer workloads, as well as new gratuity and transparency protections for tipped workers;\nand unlimited recall protections in the event of a pandemic, emergency or renovations, and other job security protections, including expedited arbitration to address disputes arising out of return-to-work issues, and training for all returning staff.”\n\nSo, as the UniteHere experience shows, solidarity helps workers win and sustains long term struggles.\n\nIt has been one of the key themes of the workers’ movement since its inception and remains a core value. But we live in an era of aspirational fascism and anti-worker propaganda, most vividly seen in the DOGE and tariff politics of the Trump administration but squalidly present around the world, including here in Canada. And in such times, solidarity can wobble and fail.\n\nOne heart-rending example of that failure occurred recently when Sean Fain of the United Auto Workers issued a statement supporting Trump’s tariffs on Canadian and Mexican built vehicles sent to the US market.\n\nThis betrayal of auto workers in other countries by Fain, who actively supported Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris in the last presidential election, illustrates the limits and pitfalls of business unionism, the class collaboration strategy also known as Gomperism.\n\nBy falling into this time-stained and unprincipled approach, Fain dishonors the history of his union and earns absolutely just criticism from workers within and without his union.\n\nFain ignores the lessons of history, which show repeatedly that when leadership of workers’ organizations try to “ride the tiger” by collaborating with business class governments, workers usually end up inside the tiger.","summary":"Solidarity has always been key to workers' struggles, and even in today’s era of rising fascism and anti-worker rhetoric, it remains a powerful force for change.\n\n\nThe post Labour victories, failures and lessons in history and solidarity appeared first on rabble.ca.","url":"https://rabble.ca/columnists/labour-victories-failures-and-lessons-in-history-and-solidarity/","image":"https://rabble.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/486844716_1057250169767223_5172431632566078740_n-e1744301107746.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 16:06:17","author":"Tom Sandborn","authors":["Tom Sandborn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.098},{"id":309798496,"title":"Trump officials outline federal blueprint for combating CCP influence on US soil","text":"Border security\n\nSafeguarding America’s food supply\n\nBoosting energy sector “dominance” \n\nDefending national security technologies\n\nEnforcing fair trade practices\n\nReshoring critical industries\n\nPAI noted that past bipartisan legislation addressing China’s influence had advanced out of committee but stalled on the Senate and House floors, with the group vowing to work with congressional Republicans to draft and advance legislation to the president’s desk. \n\nPAI also said it plans to engage grassroots advocates to help lobby Congress.\n\n“The Trump Administration has always taken the threat of Communist China seriously,” Grenell said in a statement. “It is important that we all work together to stop the CCP in their pursuit to control our food supply, our education system, national security, and all aspects of American life.

Critics have pushed back on these proposals, saying that there is little evidence of widespread voter fraud and new measures would make it more difficult for some Americans to vote.What To KnowOne aspect of the bill requires many voters to show proof of their citizenship in-person, which experts told Newsweek could make voting more difficult for the millions of Americans living in rural areas, as they may have to travel long distances to register.That, however, is only one group that stands to be affected by the bill, which could create barriers for many Americans, particularly those who are lower income, experts said.The bill states that any applicant who submits the mail voter registration form will not be registered to vote in an election for federal office unless they present \"documentary proof of United States citizenship in person to the office of the appropriate election official not later than the deadline provided by State law for the receipt of a completed voter registration application for the election\" or provide that proof to an election official the day of the election, if their state allows same-day registration.Critics say that this specific language would make it more difficult for those living in rural states to vote, as they may have to travel further than those in urban or suburban areas to reach an election office.Rural voters are among the more conservative demographics in the U.S. In the 2024 presidential race, 64 percent of rural voters backed Pesident Donald Trump, compared to 51 percent of suburban and 38 percent of urban voters, according to CNN exit poll data.Most of the more rural states skewed Republican as well.Vermont and Maine, the two most rural states, backed Vice President Kamala Harris, but the other 8 states the U.S. Census Bureau says has more than 40 percent of its population living in rural areas handily backed Trump.Costas Panagopoulos, professor of political science at Northeastern University, told Newsweek on Wednesday the requirement would \"make it more difficult for anyone who has to incur greater costs to register to vote.\"\"That could include not only the distance they would need to travel to locations where they can do that, but also disproportionately affect lower-income voters who may not be able to take time away from their work commitments in order to do so,\" he said.Still, he said the impact on rural Republican voters would not be disproportionate to Democrats, as some of their voting groups such as low-income voters and people of color may also face new barriers if this becomes law. Socioeconomic factors, rather than geographic factors, will be the key question in how this bill would impact Americans, he said.Older voters, who may face physical challenges in traveling to election offices, and college-aged voters who are not familiar with the voter registration process may also be heavily affected by the bill, he said.\"Anything that makes it harder to register to vote will disproportionately those individuals who are lower income,\" he said.Chandler James, a professor of political science at the University of Oregon, told Newsweek that it will make registering more difficult for rural voters, some of whom live hours from towns or popular centers, but the partisan effects of the bill are a bit difficult to measure.While geography is a factor in how easy it is for voters to show these documents in person, economic status is another key determinant. The poorest Americans, regardless of where they live or which party they lean toward, are generally the least likely to have an ID and therefore face the most new barriers under this bill, he said.They're also the least likely to have jobs that allow them to easily take time off to register, he said.Some studies suggest these sorts of policies have little effect on turnout, as the vast majority of Americans already have IDs. But it is particularly difficult to assess the effects, as Americans who don't have IDs are unlikely to participate in public polling, he said.\"Even though the effects may be small in terms of who is effected by this, or who ends up not voting because of this, I think it's, nonetheless, wrong approach. The goal should be to get more people to vote,\" he said. \"More legal voters, so that they can express their preferences and have their voices heard.\"Republicans have dismissed concerns that the bill will make it harder for rural voters to register.\"Imagine thinking rural Americans or people of color aren't capable of getting an ID. That's the insulting, condescending argument Democrats like Rep. Julie Johnson are using to oppose voter ID laws,\" Representative Mary Miller, an Illinois Republican, said on X in response to a critique of the bill from the Texas Democrat.Critics have also raised questions about whether the SAVE Act will make it more difficult for married women, whose married names may not match that on their birth certificate, to vote.What People Are SayingDarrell West of the Brookings Institution told Newsweek: \"The new registration requirements may make it more difficult for rural voters to cast their ballots. People there may not have all the documents that are required or have easy access to county courthouses. The legislation puts obstacles in the way of voting, which may have the affect of depressing turnout.\"Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson during a press conference on Tuesday: \"Polling shows that nearly 90 percent of the American people believe that proof of citizenship should be required to vote. There are few issues in American politics that enjoy that level of bipartisan support. This should pass with a massive bipartisan margin. But watch, it won't. The Democrats are contorting themselves into a pretzel trying to justify some sort of vote against this. Last year, they argued we were too close to a federal election to make voting changes. And then they said that non-citizens don't actually vote, and then they said the SAVE Act will somehow result in voter suppression. All that was total nonsense.\"When reached by Newsweek, a Johnson spokesperson pointed to his previous remarks.Greta Bedekovics and Sydney Bryant of the Center for American Progress in a February 28 analysis: \"The SAVE Act would particularly harm rural voters because millions of them rely on remote voter registration methods—online voter registration and mail-in voter registration—to securely and easily register to vote. States have invested decades of technological development and resources to ensure that voter registration is accessible to all Americans, but the SAVE Act would rip away these services.\"Republican Representative Chip Roy previously told Newsweek: \"This bill isn't being attacked because it'll exclude citizens from voting—it won't. It's being attacked because the policy is wildly popular with the American people, its opponents want and need illegals to vote, and they'll use anything they can to attack it.\"​What Happens NextThe bill may face a House vote this week. If it passes, it will then head to the Senate, where it could struggle to overcome the 60-vote filibuster. Democrats have been generally opposed to the legislation, and it would need support from seven of them in the Senate to pass.","summary":"As Congress plans a vote on the SAVE Act, critics say it could make it difficult for millions of Americans to vote.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/save-act-rural-americans-voting-republicans-2057612","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2624326/save-act-rural-voters.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 15:17:26","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":309798482,"title":"Tim Walz booed by veterans at Minnesota Capitol: ‘Shut your f***ing mouth!’","text":"The protesters attending the governor’s speech came after Walz’s veteran status was scrutinized by Vice President JD Vance ahead of the 2024 election.

Here’s a list of Gen Z terms and their meanings.\n\nWhile Millennials, Gen X and Boomers believe this term simply means broke or being left with less money, or even just plain unavailable, it takes on a whole new meaning for Gen Z. Out of Pocket translates to “out of character” or “wild and unhinged”.\n\nThe term ‘period’ is also likely to be misinterpreted. Despite those in the US using it to reference a full stop, younger individuals, particularly Americans, now take it to also mean something is final or non-negotiable. \n\nThe period \"has lost its original purpose because, rather than needing a symbol to indicate the end of a sentence, you can simply hit send on your message,\" Gretchen McCulloch, linguist and author of the book Because Internet: Understanding the New Rules of Language, told NPR. Using it can now therefore “indicate seriousness or a sense of finality”.\n\nAnother term that has gained notable popularity online in recent years is ‘touch grass’ – ironically, the expression advises that someone should spend time outdoors, disconnect from technology, and engage more with the physical world. This can be achieved by connecting with nature.\n\nThe term is commonly used as an insult to those attached to their devices. \n\nEra is at least a Gen Z term not so far removed from its popular definition – though, of course teens have taken a step further when using it. It refers to a period of time in a person's life, no matter how short, that is characterised by something distinctive, such as a particular emotional state, relationship, achievement, or interest.\n\nDictionary.com has used the example: “She’s started wearing all black now that she’s in her sad girl era.”\n\nThe brat concept first became tied to Kamala Harris after English singer Charli XCX declared “Kamala IS Brat”, in an X post shortly after then-president Joe Biden announced he would be stepping down from the presidential campaign last year. \n\nBut the most commonly thought of definition when ‘brat’ is used, referring to someone defiant and spoilt, has been flipped on its head for much of Gen Z. For many teens, the word has now come to mean icon, celebrating someone embracing authenticity and confidence.\n\nThe term has become far bigger than even Charlie XCX might have imagined and is used in various forms, including Brat Winter, Brat summer, Brat era. \n\nGoat is an abbreviation for Greatest Of All Time, a term predominantly used in reference to sports stars.\n\nThe Cambridge dictionary says it describes the person who has performed better than anyone else ever and used the example, “Hamilton may end up being the GOAT as far as I can see.”\n\nThough No Cap has attracted popularity just recently, it was in use by at least the 2010s in the lyrics of hiphop artists from Atlanta, Georgia, according to the Merriam Webster dictionary. Its site states: “No cap is a slang expression meaning ‘genuinely; truthfully,’ used to emphasise the sincerity or seriousness of a statement.”\n\nTo be a Stan is to be a zealous fan of a celebrity, musician or public figure. It is thought that stans tend to exhibit their admiration to an excessive degree, though the term has more recently often been bandied about. \n\nThe verb can therefore also imply engaging in any degree of fandom.\n\nThe term that stormed TikTok in 2023 seems to have stuck around. \n\nRizz, which some people have speculated is short for charisma, was credited as being popularised by Twitch streamer Kai Cenat, and is one’s ability to attract a romantic interest.\n\nOne Urban Dictionary definition previously claimed: “Rizz actually comes from the word charisma where, in southern Baltimore, they’ve started to shorten it to ‘rizzma’ (the noun replacing charisma) and to ‘rizz’ (the action of showing charisma.)”","summary":"Some Gen Z slang terms can now even earn you points in a game of Scrabble","url":"https://www.standard.co.uk/lifestyle/gen-z-slang-words-terms-meaning-b1218463.html","image":"https://static.standard.co.uk/2024/12/11/16/11153810-8657fe4a-cca9-4916-9272-2d0b6784103c.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 15:01:27","author":"Maryam Kara","authors":["Maryam Kara"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.027},{"id":309768444,"title":"Trump directs DOJ to investigate former officials Chris Krebs, Miles Taylor","text":"Trump also hit Susman Godfrey with many of the same sanctions he has put on other law firms he has accused of “weaponizing the justice system.” Some firms have negotiated to avoid punishment, while others have retaliated by suing the Trump administration.\n\nThe Wednesday orders follow a long list of opponents from which Trump pulled security clearances, including former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, former Rep. Liz Cheney, and New York Attorney General Letitia James, among others.\n\nKrebs was a cybersecurity official who oversaw the 2020 election.

In one, NPR political analyst Ron Elving promised \"any kind of dissing of old folks is a risky strategy and likely to backfire.\"\n\nNaturally, Gross never brought up the mainstream media’s shameful cover-up of Biden’s decline, or questioned the passive coverage of her own outlet, National Public Radio.\n\nTERRY GROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I am Terry Gross. Democrats are still asking questions like, why didn't Joe Biden end his reelection campaign sooner? Why did he even run for reelection, knowing that he would have been 82 when he started his second term and 86 when it ended? Why didn't his staff tell him he wasn't up to the job? How did Kamala Harris lose to Trump after Trump tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election and was convicted of 34 felonies?\n\nMy guest, Chris Whipple, explores these questions from different perspectives in his new book, Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, And The Odds In The Wildest Campaign In History. Whipple's previous book was about the first two years of the Biden presidency…. Biden's chief of staff during the first two years of his presidency, Ron Klain, was a major source for the new book about the 2024 election….\n\n(Whipple’s previous flattering book on President Biden, The Fight Of His Life, garnered the author an interview on NPR’s Morning Edition in January 2023, after classified documents were found in the then-president’s personal residence. Whipple insisted Biden’s scandal was “not even remotely comparable to Trump's shameless” classified document scandal, and that Biden’s handling of documents didn’t even rise to the “scandal” level, but was merely a “kerfuffle.”)\n\nOn Tuesday, Whipple insisted Biden’s inner circle “were operating in a kind of fog of delusion and denial” about Biden, not actively concealing his mental decline to carry him over the second-term finish line. Then he obliquely raised the media angle.\n\nWHIPPLE: Well, you know, I had my own reasons for wondering if the Biden White House staff was hiding the president because when I was writing my book on the first two years of the administration, I asked for an interview with the president. I was told I could email questions and I would get written answers in reply. You know, clearly, they were uncomfortable even then with the prospect of the president having an interview in real time with a reporter.\n\nSounds like a great story for an NPR reporter, or any reporter, to have broken before Biden withdrew from the 2024 campaign.\n\nWhipple defended his source, Biden’s chief of staff Ron Klain.\n\nGROSS: ….[Klain] saw up close what Biden's condition was. So how do you explain that?\n\nWHIPPLE: ….I am convinced that Joe Biden's inner circle was convinced that Joe Biden was capable of governing, and they believed that he could do it for another four years.”\n\nWhipple even fawned over Biden’s “parsing the details of a complex multination prisoner swap” the day he withdrew from the race in July 2024, and he concluded “you can't dismiss the fact -- it's an inconvenient fact for people who say it was a cover-up -- that Biden was capable.”","summary":"National Public Radio’s Fresh Air interview program, hosted by Terry Gross, brought on journalist Chris Whipple Tuesday to talk about his new book on former President Biden and how Biden’s handlers concealed his mental decline from the public -- and themselves?

Others say Donald Trump bottled it. Chickened out at the last minute. But if you ask the White House, last night's surprise announcement of a 90 day pause on some tariffs was always part of the plan. Either that, or a response to 'the yips'. Meanwhile, the White House decided now would be a good time to 'flood the zone' again - announcing such important presidential actions as an order to scrap regulations on shower heads because Trump likes to give his \"beautiful hair\" a proper wash. Here's all the wild and terrifying things the Trump administration got up to in the last 24 hours. Donald Trump , after insisting repeatedly that his tariff plan was not a negotiating tactic, and that they were here to stay with no pause being considered - paused most tariffs for 90 days. The markets, obviously, rebounded after he announced the news (where else?) on his Truth Social account. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent bounded out into the Rose Garden to share the happy news, with a look of relief that suggested he'd just talked the most powerful man in the world down from a ledge to avoid an actual global financial meltdown. The timeline of events is still to be deciphered, but two things stick out. About three hours before the announcement, Trump posted the following on his Truth Social account: \"THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT\" And not long after that, there was a small, but noticeable rally in the stock markets. Now, pay attention, because this is almost certainly going to come up in a court case in four years time... The above message was, by the President's own admission, posted after he started considering a pause on tariffs. Asked in the Oval Office when he started thinking about it, Trump said: \"For a period of time, I would say this morning, over the last few days I was thinking about it. I've been dealing with Scott (Bessent), with Howard (Lutnick, Secretary of Commerce) with some other people that are very professional. And I think it probably came together early this morning. Fairly early this morning.\" The \"GREAT TIME TO BUY\" post was published at 9.37am Washington DC time. The announcement came around 1.18pm. \"We just wrote it up,\" Trump added. \"We didn't have the use of...we didn't have access to lawyers or anything. We just wrote it up from our hearts, right? It was written from the heart.\" I suspect Trump will come to regret not waiting for a lawyer to be available to him... \"This was his strategy all along,\" Scott Bessent insisted to reporters after the pause was announced, explaining that 75 countries had been in touch to try and negotiate a deal. Which seems farfetched, considering the White House hasn't actually done a deal with any of them. Other sources suggest the decision was more in response to turmoil in the bond markets - which looked awfully like they could tip over and plunge the US (probably the rest of the world too) into a generational financial crisis. Explaining his screeching u-turn to reporters outside the White House yesterday - in-between chats with champion racing drivers - Trump seemed to confirm the latter was true. He said he'd come to the decision because people were \"yippy\" and \"afraid\" due to the stock market declines. He added that while he expected to reach deals, \"nothing's over yet.\" \"Yippy\", or \"the yips\" is a term Trump has used previously to describe people who bottle easy golf putts. The president said he had been monitoring the bond market and that people were \"getting a little queasy\" as bond prices had fallen and interest rates had increased in a vote of no confidence by investors in Trump's previous tariff plans. \"The bond market is very tricky,\" Trump said. \"I was watching it. But if you look at it now, it's beautiful.\" In the Oval Office, Trump was asked why, if this was the plan all along, with the objective of making other countries beg for a deal, he continued to tell his team to say it was not a negotiating tactic. Perfectly crystallising the madness that he's trying to rationalise, Trump said: \"A lot of times it's not a negotiation until it is.\" The President may have pulled back the \"reciprocal\" tariffs on other countries to the 10% baseline - aside from China , who now get a whopping 125% on everything - but his other tariffs are still going ahead. Specifically the tariff on steel and, presumably, aluminium, cars and car parts will still go ahead. And he confirmed in the Oval Office that he still plans to announce an import tax on medicines, because what the American people really want is to pay more for their drugs. Trump described the rebound following his u-turn as \"the biggest increase in the history of the stock market.\" To be clear, he was saying that as if it was something to be proud of and not as an indication that his trade war was a stupid idea. \"If you keep going,\" he added, \"you're gonna be back to where it was four weeks ago.\" And I tell you what, that's true. But it's also probably true that if he resigned as President, the stock market would probably return to where it was in January - which is significantly higher than it is now. Trump and the White House did the following things in the wake of the announcement - which seem both in content and in volume to be intended to try and dilute news coverage of the world's biggest ever u-turn... This is a lot more than usual - and barely any of them were about tariffs. They included a presidential proclamation on Education and Sharing Day, another on National Crime Victims' Rights Week and National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day. Of course we've heard this before, but of interest this time is that he's talking about it having been \"proven\" that the 2020 race was rigged, which it manifestly has not. After fuelling some Biden conspiracies, claiming without evidence that pardons were signed on his behalf without his knowledge on his last day in the White House, Trump also claimed former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi had \"admitted her guilt\" for being in charge of security at the Capital on January 6, which is also untrue. In case you were wondering whether the \"flood the zone\" tactic wasn't deliberate... Trump signed an executive order loosening rules that limit water flow for showerheads. “I like to take a nice shower, take care of my beautiful hair,\" Trump said Wednesday as he signed an executive order at the White House. “I have to stand in the shower for 15 minutes until it gets wet. Comes out drip, drip, drip. It's ridiculous.\" “What you do is you end up washing your hands five times longer, so it’s the same water,'' he added. \"And we’re going to open it up so that people can live.” The order directs Energy Secretary Chris Wright to immediately rescind what Trump called the “overly complicated federal rule” that redefined the word showerhead under the last two Democratic presidents. Biden and former President Barack Obama both imposed restrictions on water flow from showerheads and other appliances. The standards were intended to make dishwashers, showerheads, refrigerators, laundry machines and toilets use less energy and water. Trump ramped up his efforts to take revenge against his critics from his first presidency by signing two memos directing the Justice Department to investigate two officials and stripping them of any security clearances they may have. Trump's targeting of Miles Taylor, a former Department of Homeland Security official in Trump’s first term, and Chris Krebs, a former top cybersecurity official, came as the Republican president has sought to use the powers of the presidency to retaliate against his adversaries, including law firms. Trump also on Wednesday retaliated against another law firm, Susman Godfrey, as he seeks to punish firms that have links to prosecutors who have investigated him or employed attorneys he sees as opponents. Although Trump has ordered security clearances to be stripped from a number of his opponents, including former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, the president's order Wednesday directing the Justice Department to broadly investigate the actions of Taylor and Krebs marks an escalation of Trump's campaign of retribution since he returned to power. Taylor, who left the Trump administration in 2019, was later revealed to be the author of an anonymous New York Times op-ed in 2018 that was sharply critical of Trump. The person writing the essay described themselves as part of a secret “resistance” to counter Trump’s “misguided impulses,” and its publication touched off a leak investigation in Trump's first White House. Taylor later published a book under the pen name “Anonymous” and publicly revealed his identity days before the 2020 election. Trump said Wednesday that Taylor was “like a traitor” and that his writings about “confidential” meetings were “like spying.” “I think he’s guilty of treason,\" he said.

Earlier on the South Lawn, while meeting with race car drivers, Trump said we are “transitioning to greatness,” in explaining why he caved.\n\nMore than one Washington wag said, “I thought he was against transitioning.” And with tongue firmly planted in cheek, my GOP source said, “We got everything we wanted with this guy, didn’t we?”\n\nThe real reason Trump caved was the stock market. After several days of spectacular losses, it responded with a record surge on Wednesday after Trump backed off the tariffs. “He saw the writing on the wall,” a GOP member of Congress explained. “With one signature, he was killing the economy. With one social media posting, he was able to reverse that. We’re on a yo-yo and he’s pulling the string.” \n\nTuesday, the markets had also surged early until White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt showed up in the briefing room for her weekly visit to brandish her political pom poms as Trump's one-person pep squad. As soon as she said Trump was doubling down on the tariffs and planned on hitting China harder, the markets tanked again and Trump freaked out.\n\nWednesday, he had just two things on his public schedule: a meeting with race car drivers on the South Lawn – a grip and grin public appearance — and another session in the Oval Office signing executive orders. The first was originally open to the press, while the second event was not. Speculation was that Trump would wait until the last possible moment and then open up the second event to the press pool as well. “He likes cliff hangers. He loves to tell us to stay tuned for the next exciting episode and we fall for it every time,” a White House reporter explained.\n\nAnd, sure enough, Trump did just that. It’s all part of the chaos in a blender that is the Trump regime. Once the markets rebounded, Trump had the impetus he needed and the courage to jump in front of the cameras and give us another round of “Why Biden sucked”, coupled with “the press still sucks” and then ending with why a law firm sucked.\n\nHe used the opportunity to field questions and tell us why he shoots rainbows and unicorns from his backside. During the nearly hour-long meeting in the Oval Office with the press pool he discussed water pressure, opined on Asian carp, insulted Harvard, claimed the country was making $2 billion a day on tariffs (that he just paused), and then accused former employee Miles Taylor (author of “Anonymous”) of being a traitor. Trump also said he suspected Taylor is “guilty of treason.” That’s no small act coming from the president, since a treason conviction carries the death penalty as a possible punishment. Never mind. Trump also went after Christopher Krebs, the former federal employee who said the 2020 elections were fair. Trump can’t have that, so he’s claiming the “rigged” election was in part Krebs’ responsibility. He said the Department of Justice will investigate both men.\n\nBut that wasn’t all. Trump once again blamed Biden for everything that’s ever gone wrong on the planet, since Eve encouraged Adam to eat the apple. Trump said the United States was in dire straits before he blessed us all with his presence, and assured us that he pushed the pause button on the tariffs, not because of anything any other country did, but because he had a good feeling about doing so. He also said he’d negotiate directly with Iran on the “nuclear question” for as long as he could - based on his “feel” of the situation. What they have to negotiate remains unspoken since Trump – like other presidents before him – believes Iran shouldn’t have a nuclear weapon. That’s what they call a “deal breaker.\"\n\nThere are those who don’t appreciate Trump’s “feel” for anything. “He creates problems and then pretends to solve them,” my GOP source, a member of Congress, explained. “We enable him and we haven’t learned yet how to battle this stupidity. The country and the world is suffering from the whims of a madman.”\n\nWhile that may be true, no one in the GOP has stood up to Trump, and the Democrats are still trying to figure out how to handle him. The press? We gave up long ago. Now we’re just part of the circus.\n\nTrump’s former fixer, Michael Cohen, has made the rounds on social media talking about the problem. He’s a frequent guest on Jim Acosta’s Substack show, as well as on Joe Walsh’s show and several others. Cohen’s frequent rant is that Trump only cares about Trump and the rest of us are screwed.\n\nNothing drives that point home more than watching some of my colleagues in the press pool serve up softball questions to Trump that amount to asking “Can you tell us why you’re so great?” Trump usually responds to those with “that was a really good question,” if you need a prompt to understand what I’m talking about. \n\nLost in the haze of Trump’s befuddled narcissism and fascism is the often ignored reality: this is not normal. There are many who were and are ready for something outside of the box. That’s why they voted for Trump. That’s why many don’t abandon him now. “He speaks his mind. He’s great,” my favorite Missouri in-law tells me.\n\nBut, let’s look at then and now.\n\nWhen I was eight years old, man landed on the moon and measles was nearly a thing of the past. Today, millions believe both that the moon landing was faked and that the measles vaccine causes autism. In Texas, children are dying of measles again as the once nearly-eradicated disease makes a comeback. \n\nWhen I was a child, we sang “Give Peace a Chance.” In the Oval Office on Wednesday, the president of the United States boasted about the U.S. having weapons, “some of which you wouldn’t believe,” and he said he wasn’t above using them on Iran.\n\nBut wait, there’s more. \n\nWhen meeting with Benjamin Netanyahu in the White House earlier this week, Trump doubled down on declaring that he wanted to develop Gaza, which he said is “great ocean front property.” He proposed a “Gaza Freedom Zone” that would be free of Palestinians. Bibi and Trump both said the Palestinians should just move out. I guess they’ll call it a freedom zone because it’s free of Palestinians.\n\nWhen I was a child, the New York Times broke the story of the Pentagon Papers. The Washington Post broke the Watergate scandal. A crooked president fell. Today, the New York Times has Maggie Haberman, who has been accused of being a shill for Trump. The Washington Post? It wouldn’t endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris for president for fear of angering Trump.\n\nRepublican President Ronald Reagan (the architect for the tragedy that is today’s Republican Party) opposed tariffs and supported a pathway to citizenship for immigrants, noting that tariffs destroy economies and the country needs immigrants. Trump is happy sending immigrants to prison, deporting them and denying student visas to college-aged students while trying to wreck the economy with tariffs.\n\nThe Supreme Court backed the Washington Post and the New York Times in their battles against President Richard Nixon. Today, the Supreme Court is allowing Trump to extradite immigrants – apparently even those like a father in Maryland who’ve committed no crime — to foreign prisons.\n\nThe popular destination is El Salvador, the new Gitmo and soon-to-be Super Max that will house American natural-born citizens — if Trump has his way. Where’s Snake Plisken when you need him? “Welcome to the human race.”\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nTrump is also busy pushing voter suppression, and as long-time White House Reporter Jon-Christopher Bua mentioned on X, Wednesday’s outing on the South Lawn and in the Oval Office is “Just another Trump opportunity to deflect & Flood The Zone — keeping the story far away from his reversal on tariffs & his possible market manipulation. Trump is a master of distraction. As you know, In politics as in comedy, timing is everything!”\n\nTrump is a failed comedian, a successful politician and an absolute menace to the world. His current administration takes two steps backward for every step taken forward. Fire the FAA safety inspectors – then rehire them. Have DOGE come in and club to death a government office, then have to rehire those they’ve fired because they’re essential personnel. Levy tariffs. Remove tariffs. Levy tariffs again. Put them on pause. Nothing is done by reason. It’s all by Trump’s “feel” for the moment that is enabled by those who kiss his ring and nether regions every time they’re in the same room with him.\n\nThe press can’t push back because he’s co-opted us. Our constitutionally mandated job is to hold truth to power. It doesn’t make us “Fake News,” it makes us vital. Since Trump controls the corporate media, most independent and responsible voices have been chased away to Substack or other social media venues where the voices are lost among the cacophony of the extremists on both sides of the political aisle.\n\nTrump is greedy. Trump is arrogant. Trump doesn’t deserve the respect that comes with the Oval Office and Trump doesn’t care – as long as you pay attention to him.\n\nI recently asked his niece, Mary, if she believes Donald loves anyone. I’m not even sure he loves himself. She agreed, but says that her uncle never got love as a kid and never learned it as an adult. Empathy isn’t in his bag of tricks.\n\nWe recently lost the actor Val Kilmer. In the movie “Tombstone,” Kurt Russell (formerly Snake Plissken in “Escape from New York”) as Wyatt Earp asks Kilmer’s Doc Holliday what makes a man like the criminal Johnny Ringo tick. “A man like Ringo has got a great big hole, right in the middle of him. He can never kill enough, or steal enough, or inflict enough pain to ever fill it.”\n\nEarp asks what Ringo needs. \n\n“Revenge” Holliday says.\n\n“For what?” Earp asks.\n\n“For being born,” Holliday says evenly.\n\nThat remains the best explanation I’ve heard yet for the pile of steaming insanity that currently inhabits the Oval Office.\n\nThe sad part is, I remain convinced that we will not see the United States I grew up in for at least another 20 years – if ever – because of Donald Trump.\n\nStill, it’s nice to see the penguins and seals get to notch a win on their belt as they stand against the Donald.","summary":"The president caves in on tariffs in under a week — but it may be too late","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/04/10/suffering-from-the-whims-of-a-madman-maga-measures-the-true-cost-of-trumps-tariffs-gamble/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2020/03/donald-trump-capitol-hill-hellscape-0326201.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 13:52:05","author":"Brian Karem","authors":["Brian Karem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.171},{"id":309909360,"title":"Harris Shows Little Self-Reflection Over Weak Campaign","text":"Last week, former Vice President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris made an appearance at the Leading Women Defined Summit, during which she made her first public remarks about Donald Trump\u0019s presidency.

A rundown of who is running for California governor in 2026, who is speculated to run and a question for our readers.Tariffs bring anxiety to the Costco aisles: Cut back or stock up before prices rise?Nine great (and free) hikes around Palm Springs that locals love.And here's today's e-newspaper.The Golden State's next gubernatorial election is roughly 18 months away, but the race has already started with a crowded field of candidates hoping to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom. Whoever wins in 2026 will take the wheel of the most-populated state in the U.S. — and an economic powerhouse fueled by major industries, including real estate, tech, healthcare, agriculture, manufacturing and entertainment. California’s next governor will also inherit a bureaucracy that’s been largely ineffective at reducing our nation-leading homelessness, boosting much-needed housing construction, or mitigating the high cost of living. Plus there’s the work underway to reduce the state’s reliance on fossil fuels, clean up our worst-in-the-nation air, build resilience against the impacts of climate change and keep the water flowing. And don’t forget the long-delayed high-speed rail project and the global spotlight shining on Los Angeles as it prepares to host the 2028 Olympic Games. Also, Donald Trump is president and the state budget is shaky. Who wants this big, difficult job? Here are the people making their bids so far: Eleni Kounalakis (D): The current lieutenant governor of California was the first to announce a bid for Newsom’s current job. She’s highlighted her work opposing tuition hikes, offshore drilling, along with championing reproductive choice.Tony Thurmond (D): Currently California’s superintendent of public instruction, Thurmond entered the race early — in September 2023 — and has framed his campaign around being an advocate for the working class.Toni Atkins (D): Atkins made history as the first woman to hold both top jobs in the state Legislature: speaker of the Assembly and president pro tempore of the Senate. Atkins said her decades of experience in Sacramento make her “uniquely prepared” to lead the state.Betty Yee (D): The former state controller announced her candidacy in March 2024, emphasizing her modest upbringing by Chinese immigrant parents and her fiscal leadership in state government.Antonio Villaraigosa (D): He served as Assembly speaker before being elected mayor of Los Angeles in 2005, becoming the first Latino to hold the office since 1872. When he announced his bid for governor (his second attempt), Villaraigosa emphasized his ability to work with both Democrats and Republicans.Chad Bianco (R): The current Riverside County sheriff and an avid supporter of President Trump, Bianco entered the race in February, saying the California dream had “turned into a nightmare.”Katie Porter (D): A former congresswoman from Orange County and current UC Irvine law school professor, Porter entered the race in March and said she aims to protect California from Trump’s policies, including threats to withhold disaster relief. Stephen Cloobeck (D): A Southern California philanthropist and businessman who made his fortune in real estate and hospitality, Cloobeck has emphasized a pro-business tone in his campaign, saying the Democratic establishment has let Californians down.Xavier Becerra (D): He's the former U.S. Health and Human Services secretary under President Biden. As California's attorney general before that, he sued the Trump administration roughly 120 times. Confrontations with Trump over California’s more progressive policies are expected to remain a focal point, which Becerra has said he’s ready for.Who else could join the race? Most notably, former Vice President Kamala Harris, who is reportedly considering a run after her failed bid for the presidency last year. Should she jump in, Harris “would seismically reshape the already crowded race,” my colleague Julia Wick explained late last year. A November poll from the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies, co-sponsored by The Times, found that nearly half of voters would be very or somewhat likely to support Harris’ candidacy. “The current gubernatorial field is a who’s who of California politicians, but lacks a clear favorite or star with widespread name recognition,” Julia wrote. “The vast majority of California’s 22 million voters have yet to pay attention to the race and have little familiarity with the candidates.” What do you want from California’s next governor? Yes, the race is far off and a lot can change between now and November 2026. But if so many people are already lining up for the job, why not start the interview process? We’d like your help drafting some questions for them through our newest California citizens agenda survey. Our goal is to focus less on the campaign as a horse race and more on the issues that California voters (is that you?) want to understand before taking part in the democratic process and choosing whom to put in positions of power. To do that, we emphasize one key question: What do you want the candidates to be talking about as they compete for votes? We first launched this experiment at the start of the 2024 election cycle — and hundreds of Essential California readers weighed in. Your responses helped inform how we covered the election in the newsletter last year, as we took your questions to U.S. Senate candidates, unpacked the confusing state judge races and explored ways to stay civically engaged beyond the voting booth. You can fill out the new survey here to weigh in on the governor’s race. We hope you’ll take a few minutes to respond — and share the survey with others so we can hear from as many people as possible. Then we’ll start looking through your responses and draft some questions for the growing field of candidates, highlighting the common concerns you have and issues you care about.

In a straw poll of 267 conference participants from eight states, including Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania state Treasurer Stacy Garrity was the clear favorite to win the Republican primary for its 2026 gubernatorial election. She received 41% of the vote, as Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Penn., came in a distant second at 9%. While 2026 is still long down the road, and neither Pennsylvania politician has formally announced a run, both Republicans embraced the opportunity to tease their potential bids. \"Appreciate the support from conservatives across Pennsylvania. No decisions made yet—but I’m listening and focused on doing whatever it takes to help Republicans win in 2025 and beyond,\" Garrity said following her straw poll win at the leadership conference. DEM TAKES AIM AT TRUMP, TILLIS IN 2026 SENATE LAUNCH VIDEO FOR 'TANKING OUR ECONOMY' Garrity made history in 2024 by receiving the most votes in a Pennsylvania state election – crushing Democrat Gov. Josh Shapiro's 2022 record by half a million votes. Garrity campaigned for re-election alongside Sen. Dave McCormick, who unseated longtime Democrat Sen. Bob Casey. DEM GOVERNORS REVOLT AGAINST TRUMP'S 'LIBERATION DAY' TARIFFS Shapiro wasn’t up for re-election in 2024, though his name was floated as a potential running mate for Vice President Kamala Harris. But 2026 presents an opportunity for Republicans to gain control of the state's highest office. Speeches at the leadership conference prove that big Republican wins in 2024 have invigorated the party's base in the traditionally competitive battleground state. \"We as a party are here as winners. The Keystone State sent President Trump back to the White House, sent Bob Casey back to Scranton, elected a Republican Attorney General for the first time in over a decade. And next November, the Keystone State will send a Republican to the Governor's Mansion,\" Garrity said during her remarks. Garrity emerged as the frontrunner in a hypothetical matchup against Meuser, 2022 GOP nominee Doug Mastriano, and state Sens. Kristin Phillips-Hill and Scott Martin. If Garrity, a President Donald Trump ally, and Meuser decide to throw their names into the gubernatorial race, it could tee up a competitive primary. Both Pennsylvanian politicians have indicated announcements could come as early as this summer. Garrity told the Pennsylvania Capital-Star on Saturday a decision on her gubernatorial bid is coming \"probably in the summer.\" Meuser, who also spoke at the conference, confirmed to Fox News Digital that his own decision will come by mid-summer or sooner. \"I’ve been encouraged by the strong support I’ve received from people all across Pennsylvania urging me to consider a run for governor. Right now, I’m doing my due diligence, meeting with stakeholders, and seriously evaluating how I can best serve the Commonwealth. \"I expect to make a decision by mid-summer, or sooner if appropriate. In the meantime, I’m staying focused on advancing President Trump’s America-First Agenda in Congress — growing our economy, securing the border, and unleashing American energy dominance,\" Meuser told Fox News Digital. As Garrity and Meuser continue representing Pennsylvania as they mull 2026 gubernatorial campaigns, the Republican Party of Pennsylvania told Fox News Digital they are \"excited to have strong potential candidates\" for governor. \"There is no question that Pennsylvanians are NOT better off with Josh Shapiro as our Governor, and they will be ready to make a change in November 2026. Shapiro's scandal-ridden administration, combined with his recent use of $5 million of taxpayer money to promote antisemitism, have set the stage for a GOP victory. Republicans are excited to have strong potential candidates to be our next Governor,\" the Republican Party of Pennsylvania said in a statement. JOSH SHAPIRO TELLS MAHER HE'S 'DAMN PROUD' OF BEING JEWISH, DODGES WHETHER IT FACTORED INTO VP SNUB IN 2024 The Republican Party of Pennsylvania's accusations relate to Shapiro's $5 million donation to a Philadelphia Muslim community center. Front Page Magazine reported that an imam at the Al-Aqsa Islamic Society once said, \"Jews are the vilest people.\" Shapiro himself is Jewish. Speaking on a Philadelphia stage after Gov.

The person writing the essay described themselves as part of a secret “resistance” to counter Trump’s “misguided impulses,” and its publication touched off a leak investigation in Trump's first White House.\n\nTaylor later published a book under the pen name “Anonymous” and publicly revealed his identity days before the 2020 election.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that Taylor was “like a traitor” and that his writings about “confidential” meetings were “like spying.”\n\n“I think he’s guilty of treason,\" he said.\n\nTaylor responded by saying Trump had proved his point.\n\n“Dissent isn’t unlawful. It certainly isn’t treasonous. America is headed down a dark path,\" he wrote on X.\n\nTrump named Krebs the director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency but became angered with him after he declared the 2020 election that Trump lost to be secure and the ballot counts to be accurate.\n\nKrebs did not respond to a message seeking comment, but late Wednesday he shared on X a message he originally posted when he left government in 2020: “Honored to serve. We did it right.”\n\nTrump has falsely claimed he was cheated out of reelection in 2020 by widespread fraud, despite a mountain of evidence to the contrary. Recounts, reviews and audits in the battleground states where he disputed his loss all affirmed Biden’s victory. Judges, including some he appointed, rejected dozens of his legal challenges.\n\n“It’s bizarre to see a president investigate his own administration and his own appointee,” said David Becker, a former Justice Department lawyer and coauthor of “The Big Truth,” a book about Trump’s 2020 election lies.\n\nBecker noted that Krebs issued his reassurances about the security of the upcoming election for months during 2020 without pushback from the then-president, with Trump only souring on him after the votes were counted.\n\n“The reason he can sit in the White House today and govern from that position is because our election system is secure and has accurately determined who has won the presidency,” Becker said.\n\nSusman Godfrey, the firm Trump targeted in an order Wednesday, represented Dominion Voting Systems in a lawsuit that accused Fox News of falsely claiming that the voting company had rigged the 2020 presidential election. Fox News ultimately agreed to pay nearly $800 million to avert a trial.\n\nThe order bars the firm from using government resources or buildings, according to White House staff secretary Will Scharf.\n\nIn a statement, Susman Godfrey responded that people who know the firm know it takes seriously its duty to uphold the rule of law. “This principle guides us now,” the firm said. \"There is no question that we will fight this unconstitutional order.”\n\nTrump has issued a series of orders meant to punish firms, including by ordering the suspension of lawyers’ security clearances and revoking federal contracts. He’s succeeded in extracting concessions from some who have settled, but others have challenged the orders in court.","summary":"President Donald Trump intensified his efforts to punish his critics by signing a pair of memoranda directing the Justice Department to investigate two officials from his first administration and stripping them of any security clearances they may have.\n\nTrump's targeting of Miles Taylor, a former ...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/543724/Trump-targets-Anonymous-author-and-former-top-cybersecurity-official-in-escalation-of-retribution","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/4/4f65d3300fd1ee1582feb52e6fa6e8c0ca79af207ce01d4ce9cc4ead409819ac_p4178877.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 13:00:00","author":"Michelle L.

No one was more upset than the censorious left-wing “fact” police.\n\nAngie Holan, the leader of the Poynter Institute’s International Fact-Checking Network, marked “International Fact-Checking Day” by proclaiming they are needed now more than ever: “Fact-checking holds the line on reality for history’s sake. It builds evidence-based records that can withstand political pressures.”\n\nFact check? False. Poynter’s PolitiFact routinely demonstrates that its “line on reality” is a party line. It doesn’t “withstand political pressures.” It’s a political pressure group seeking to damage Republicans.\n\nThe latest glowing exhibit is Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J. In his “historic” 25-hour speech on the Senate floor in protest of President Donald Trump, PolitiFact plucked out one innocuous claim and ruled it “True.” Booker said, “The consumer confidence in this country has gone way down.” It’s true. The Conference Board measurement has dropped since Trump won.\n\nBut what about the other 25 hours of statements? Were they entirely factual? Don’t count on PolitiFact for a ruling because it is in the tank for Booker. He’s received five “True” ratings in a row dating back to 2019.\n\nIn 2020, it gave him a “True” for stating the Senate is “dominated by millionaires” and that he is “not one of them.” In 2019, he was ruled “True” for claiming, “In 2017, we had more marijuana possession arrests in our country than all other violent crimes combined.”\n\nIsn’t it obvious that Booker bumbled—that marijuana possession is not a violent crime?\n\nOverall, PolitiFact has granted Booker 22 ratings as “True” or “Mostly True” (11 of each), and just eight that were “Mostly False” or “False.” There are zero “Pants on Fire” ratings. So, he’s in the “green zone” 64.7% of the time, and he’s Code Red just 23.5% of the time.\n\nCompare this to the page of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. He’s received 160 “fact checks” over the years, and only 31 of them are “True” or “Mostly True” (19.4%). He’s been flagged on the “False” side 107 times (66.9%). That includes 11 “Pants On Fire” ratings. Notice these percentages are dramatically opposed to Booker’s, which demonstrates the political tilt of PolitiFact.\n\nIt’s true for the Democrats as a whole. Three Democrat senators have one solitary “Pants On Fire” demerit in the PolitiFact archives: Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Minority Whip Dick Durbin, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. No Senate Democrat has more than one. Every other Democrat senator has zero. That’s right: Sen. Bernie Sanders has none. Sen. Elizabeth Warren has none. (Former Sen. Kamala Harris has none.)\n\nIn fact, 18 Democrat senators (if you include Sen. Angus King of Maine, who caucuses with the Democrats) have absolutely no ratings anywhere on the “False” side of the meter. Seven have zero ratings whatsoever: Sens. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, Peter Welch of Vermont, as well as Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico, and then rookie Sens. Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland, Lisa Blunt Rochester of Delaware, and Andy Kim of New Jersey.\n\nAdd up all the “Trues” and “Falses” (excluding “Half True” ratings), and the Senate Democrat caucus has a “Truth-O-Meter” ratio of 330 to 165 (66.8% in the “True” lane). As a category, they’re the opposite of Cruz.\n\nSo when Holan claimed only “politicians who want to create their own realities are fighting hard against fact-checking,” she was making the classic Stephen Colbert argument: Reality has a liberal bias. This is why most Americans don’t trust biased “fact-checkers.”\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The White House has not said whether Trump’s exam would include a cognitive test, which Biden did not undergo as part of his White House physical.\n\nThe lack of testing for Biden fueled concerns he was mentally unfit for office, with Trump challenging him to a cognitive test on the 2024 campaign trail. Then-Trump primary foe Nikki Haley called for mental competency tests for politicians over the age of 75, which applied to both men.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump insisted on taking a cognitive assessment exam and scored a 30/30 on the test. His physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who has since become a Texas congressman, said in 2018 that Trump shows no signs of mental deterioration. Trump was measured at 6 feet, 3 inches, and weighed 239 pounds. While Jackson advised him to eat better and exercise more, he credited his “good genes” for his health.\n\nTrump boasted about how easy it was to pass a cognitive test in an interview with Fox News in July 2020.\n\n“It was 30 or 35 questions. The first questions are very easy. The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question,” Trump told Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel. \n\nTrump’s path back to the White House accelerated after the June 2024 presidential debate, during which Biden’s fumbling and rambling performance raised widespread concern he was unfit for a second term in office. He exited the race shortly thereafter, paving the way for former Vice President Kamala Harris to replace him in the campaign’s final months.\n\nRecent books detailed how Biden’s closest advisers shielded his declining mental fitness from the public.\n\n“Clearly, they were uncomfortable even then with the prospect of the president having an interview in real-time with a reporter,” said Chris Whipple, the author of Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History in a recent interview.\n\nAnother book from CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson, Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again, detailed the “cover-up” of Biden’s mental decline.\n\nFormer White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre even claimed that Biden “doesn’t need a cognitive test” during a press briefing in February 2024. \n\n“That is not my assessment; that is the assessment of the president’s doctor,” Jean-Pierre continued.\n\nThe Harris campaign and her surrogates routinely poked Trump over allegations that he was not on the campaign stump due to his age.\n\n“He is, as we have seen, only focused on himself. And now, he is ducking debates and canceling interviews,” Harris said at a campaign stop in Grand Rapids, Michigan. “And check this out — his own campaign team recently said it is because of exhaustion.”\n\n“We do not need to see what an older, loonier Donald Trump looks like with no guardrails,” former President Barack Obama told Michigan Democrats during a campaign stop. \n\nThe Trump campaign hit back against Harris, claiming that Trump was “running laps around Kamala Harris on the campaign trail, engaging in far more interviews, hosting more events, and rallies.”\n\nIn August, Trump claimed he would release his medical records during an interview with CBS News. “Oh sure, I would do that very gladly, sure,” he said then.\n\nTwo months later, after Harris released her medical records, the Trump campaign claimed that his medical records had already been released following his survival of an assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania, in July.\n\n“President Trump has voluntarily released updates from his personal physician, as well as detailed reports from Dr. Ronny Jackson, who treated him after the first assassination attempt,” said former Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung. “All have concluded he is in perfect and excellent health to be Commander in Chief.”\n\nJackson’s July 20 report claimed Trump was “doing well” and recovering following the Butler incident. Roughly a week later, Jackson wrote in a second report pushing back against criticisms that Trump did not suffer from a gunshot wound.\n\nMore specific details of Trump’s physical, including his weight and height, will likely come on Friday after the exam has concluded.","summary":"President Donald Trump will undergo his first physical examination of his second administration on Friday, and questions about cognitive testing hang in the balance. &#8220;I am pleased to report that my long scheduled Annual Physical Examination will be done at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Friday of this week,&#8221; the president wrote on Truth [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3374836/cognitive-test-looms-large-over-trump-physical-exam/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/trump-laken-riley.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 11:00:00","author":"Mabinty Quarshie","authors":["Mabinty Quarshie"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.169},{"id":309683116,"title":"Michelle breaks silence on divorce rumours with Barack Obama: ‘Was making a choice’","text":"In a candid conversation on the Work in Progress podcast with actress Sophia Bush, former First Lady Michelle Obama addressed her recent absence from public events and the rumors surrounding her marriage. The 61-year-old revealed that her decision to step back was driven by a desire for self-care, not marital issues.Speculation about trouble in the Obamas’ marriage escalated when Michelle did not attend former President Jimmy Carter’s funeral in January 2024 and later announced she would not attend Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration. Many interpreted her absence as a sign of a rift with her husband, former President Barack Obama.Michelle set the record straight on the podcast, explaining that her absence was a deliberate personal choice. “I now have the opportunity to control my own calendar,” she said. “I could have made a lot of these decisions years ago, but I didn’t give myself that freedom.”Personal boundariesShe emphasized that the choice to skip events was about prioritizing her well-being. “That was me making a choice for myself—not what I had to do, not what I thought other people wanted me to do.”Michelle addressed the societal pressure women face when asserting personal boundaries. “That’s the thing we as women struggle with—disappointing people. So much so that people couldn’t fathom I was making a choice for myself—they assumed my husband and I were divorcing.”Despite pulling back from certain public events, Michelle clarified that she remains active in initiatives she cares about. “I still give speeches, work on projects, and continue to support girls’ education,” she said, also mentioning the upcoming opening of the Obama Presidential Center.Barack’s candid commentBarack Obama recently acknowledged the couple’s past struggles, saying he was “in a deep deficit” with Michelle and has been trying to “dig [himself] out of that hole” with shared experiences. Michelle had earlier written in her memoir Becoming that Barack’s political career placed a strain on their marriage, leaving her feeling lonely and exhausted at times.Michelle also recently launched a new podcast, IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson, which premiered on March 11. The show explores “life’s biggest questions” through honest conversations aimed at fostering connection and comfort.Still a force in politicsMichelle hasn’t entirely stepped away from political engagement. During the 2024 campaign, she voiced strong opposition to Donald Trump and supported Vice President Kamala Harris. At a rally in Michigan, she urged voters: “Please, please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump, who knows nothing about us, who has shown deep contempt for us.”32 years of togethernessMichelle and Barack Obama have been married for 32 years and share two daughters.

Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former congresswoman and CIA officer, will face Republican Lt. Governor Winsome Earle-Sears, a Marine veteran, after both state parties confirmed their nominees in recent days.One of the only competitive races of the year, the Virginia gubernatorial contest will be closely watched by both parties — and is often treated as a referendum on the president's party. Historically, Virginia has voted for a governor of the opposite political party, every time a new president has been elected since 1977.The race is already breaking state records for fundraising, with Earle-Sears raising more than $3 million from January to March and Spanberger raising around $6.7 million during the same period, according to the campaigns. In an interview with \"America Decides,\" Spanberger told CBS News she believes national issues will weigh heavily on the race, from the Trump administration's mass layoffs of federal employees, more than 144,000 of whom live in Virginia, as well as what she called an \"antagonistic trade war.\"\"All of this impacts Virginia, and the stakes of this election reflect that,\" said Spanberger.When asked whether Earle-Sears supports President Trump's tariff policy, her campaign deflected but said in a statement, \"After leftists like Joe Biden and Abigail Spanberger devastated our economy and standing in the world—President Trump is doing the work to put America first again.\"Earle-Sears has attacked Spanberger for her votes in Congress supporting Biden administration policies including the Inflation Reduction Act, which passed in 2022 with no Republican support. Earle-Sears argues it has contributed to inflation.\"I think it's a ridiculous assertion given that my opponent has been eager to claim credit for some of the funding that came through some of those federal dollars to Virginia's Commonwealth,\" Spanberger told CBS News. \"But, the reality is that my opponent is endeavoring to distract, because she's not talking about the fact that we've seen an absolute tanking of the stock market because of Donald Trump's actions.\"While the economy is a top issue for Virginians and both candidates, advocates are also hoping gun safety mobilizes voters.Spanberger is set to receive the endorsement of Everytown for Gun Safety Thursday, the group first told CBS News. Everytown, established by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, is also contributing $1 million to the race, which will include organizing efforts and political ads.Spanberger herself became a volunteer for pro-gun control group Moms Demand Action after leaving the CIA.\"Abigail Spanberger understands that common-sense laws to keep guns out of dangerous hands are crucial to ensuring public safety,\" John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety, said of the endorsement. Everytown also points to their success at the state legislative level in 2023 when nine gun safety volunteers won races and helped flip the House of Delegates, the lower house of Virginia's legislature, to Democratic control.The group says internal polling from that year revealed it's a top three issue for Virginia voters in battleground districts across Northern Virginia, Richmond and Hampton Roads.Youngkin vetoed an assault weapons ban and other gun control bills that passed the state legislature last year. He did sign two other gun measures, including one that bans auto sears, a device that converts semi-automatic handguns into automatic weapons. He also signed \"Lucia's Law,\" making it a crime for parents who allow children deemed as threats to access firearms.Earle-Sears has supported the governor's vetoes.In 2021, Earle-Sears became the first Black woman ever elected to statewide office in Virginia. She will have to appeal to moderates and independent voters in the blue-leaning state but has given mixed messages on her support for Mr. Trump in recent years.In 2020, she co-chaired the group \"Black Americans to re-elect President Trump,\" but in 2022, following the midterms, she told FOX Business it was \"time to move on.\" \"A true leader understands when they have become a liability,\" she said during the interview. \"A true leader understands when it's time to step off the stage.\"She went on to vote for Mr. Trump in 2024. A source close to the campaign says she sees the president as a federal partner. It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump offers Earle-Sears an endorsement given the high stakes of this year's few marquee races. While Mr. Trump made inroads in Virginia during the 2024 presidential election, the state comfortably went for Vice President Kamala Harris in November.Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who is barred from serving back-to-back terms, endorsed his Lt. Governor early in the race.","summary":"The candidates are set for this year's Virginia gubernatorial race, a closely watched bellwether just one year after President Trump's 2024 win.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/winsome-earle-sears-abigail-spanberger-virginia-governor/","image":"https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/04/09/877d012e-1236-4e68-9902-ebac0b57930a/thumbnail/1200x630/41d9df56f1ca4306e26d37425a1f4c8e/spanberger-earle-sears.jpg?v=653dd6912cdd8596c9bfea812c355f95","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3666548_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-04-10 10:09:33","author":"Natalie Brand","authors":["Natalie Brand"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.469},{"id":309707210,"title":"Democrats running for California governor take digs at Kamala Harris' delayed decision on the race","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris' lingering decision about whether to run for governor has other Democrats in the 2026 race steamed, saying the state needs leaders to step up now to protect Californians and combat the destructive policies of President Trump. The criticism of Harris' delayed decision, which is expected to come this summer, varies from sharp and direct to oblique and circuitous. “The challenges facing California are too great for us to wait for a candidate who wants to come in late in the game,” said former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who announced his gubernatorial campaign in July. “California is not a steppingstone to higher office.” He pointed to the unsuccessful, abbreviated campaign Harris had in the 2024 presidential contest because of then-President Biden’s decision to bow out of the race in the summer, months before the election. “This will not be a coronation,” he said in an interview this month. “You can’t run at the end of the rainbow. We saw a 100-day campaign. Look what that brought us.” Former Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine and former U.S. Health and Human Services chief Xavier Becerra, two other top Democrats running for governor, also called out politicians for sitting on the sidelines. “No one should be waiting to lead. I think we need to make a case right now,” Porter said in a March interview, shortly after she was asked what Harris’ potential entry into the race would mean for her candidacy. “There’s an incredible urgency on the ground that I think stretches across California and across the political spectrum.” Becerra made a similar point as he announced his candidacy in early April. “Watching what’s unfolding before our eyes made it clear this is not a time to sit on the sidelines,” Becerra said in an interview. Polls show that Harris would become the instant front-runner if she decides to jump into the governor's race. Not only is Harris known nationwide as a former vice president and presidential nominee, but she has a well-established track record of winning statewide races in California. Harris is expected to make a decision by the end of the summer, according to a source close to the former vice president. The source pointed to Harris' experience as San Francisco’s district attorney, the state’s attorney general and U.S. senator before being elected vice president in 2020. “No one can question her commitment to public service and the people of California and our nation,” this person said. “The vice president’s decisions will always center on how best to serve the people.” Harris’ success in the state, her name recognition and her national donor base are among the reasons many expected her to easily clear the field if she enters the governor’s race. “Her looming as a possible gubernatorial candidate has a very definite chilling effect on everyone else’s fundraising ability,” said veteran Democratic strategist Darry Sragow. “Virtually all donors use any excuse they can to not write a check. … That would be compounded by the fact of the looming uncertain presence here is a very significant political player, presumably the most senior political player in the Democratic field.” But other California Democratic strategists note that donors’ patience could eventually wear thin at a time when the party is brimming with angst about the large checks they wrote in the 2024 election as well as the policy decisions coming out of the Trump White House. Tracy Austin, a prominent Los Angeles-based Democratic fundraiser who has ties with several candidates in the race, says there is already mounting frustration in the donor community — not only because of how long Harris is taking to make a decision, but also because of the amount of money they spent on her 2024 presidential campaign as well as broader concerns about the party’s direction. Fundraising reports aren't due until July, but candidates are required to report donations over $5,000. Villaraigosa leads the pack, with about $3.2 million from donors such as director Rob Reiner, producer and television personality Ryan Seacrest and former Walt Disney chief Michael Eisner. Other candidates have entered the race much more recently, and their footprint among donors who write large checks is far smaller. A little more than $215,000 for Republican County Sheriff Chad Bianco; $133,400 for Porter. The candidates' strength among small-dollar donors won't be visible for months. Republicans are relishing the prospect of Harris entering the race. Bianco blasted out a fundraising appeal with a message line invoking Harris’ name. “Now, the threat that the Democrat leadership poses to our communities is graver than ever before,” he wrote earlier this month. “That’s because Kamala Harris is positioning herself to run for Governor of California. Today, I’m asking you to help me defeat radical Kamala Harris in the race for California Governor.” Harris’ potential candidacy was frequently raised during the state GOP convention late last month in Sacramento. “I personally think it's beneath her, but I welcome it,” outgoing party chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson told reporters. “I would love to see her on the ballot.” Since losing the 2024 election to Trump, Harris has made few public appearances — visiting firefighters and volunteers at the devastating Los Angeles-area wildfires, watching Broadway plays in New York City and accepting an award from the NAACP. Harris has been circumspect during her few public appearances since losing the 2024 presidential election. On April 3, she made some of her most pointed remarks since Trump took office during brief remarks before a gathering of Black female business leaders, politicians and other prominent people. Harris decried the rollback of fundamental rights under the Trump administration and vowed to remain active in the battle to safeguard constitutional protections. “I’ll see you out there,” she vowed. “I’m not going anywhere.”","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris doesn't plan on making a decision about entering the race until the end of the summer.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-04-10/democrats-running-for-california-governor-take-digs-at-kamala-harris-delayed-decision-on-the-race","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f091fec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/7844x4118+0+557/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7c%2Fbb%2F4aa714564dc58a808a79c59fec82%2F1501058-me-kamala-ha","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-10 10:00:27","author":"Seema Mehta","authors":["Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.062},{"id":309709938,"title":"Trump was ‘the candidate of peace’. Now he’s fanning the flames of war | Mohamad Bazzi","text":"Throughout the last presidential campaign, Donald Trump portrayed himself as the candidate who would bring peace to an unstable world. He promised to use his deal-making experience to negotiate an end to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and Israel’s war on Gaza, among other global conflicts.\n\n“If Kamala wins, only death and destruction await because she is the candidate of endless wars. I am the candidate of peace,” Trump told a rally in Michigan on 1 November, as he urged Arab and Muslim American voters to choose him over the Democratic candidate, Kamala Harris.\n\nBut less than 100 days into his second term, Trump has not only instigated economic and political chaos at home, he is also stoking multiple conflicts abroad. Last month, Trump launched a new US bombing campaign against Houthi rebels in Yemen, who have been disrupting international shipping in the Red Sea. Trump also supported the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, after he imposed a new siege on Gaza and restarted Israel’s devastating war against the Palestinian territory. And on 28 March, Israel bombed Beirut for the first time since agreeing to a US-brokered ceasefire with the Hezbollah militia in Lebanon, jeopardizing another fragile truce in the region.\n\nTrump’s campaign trail promises of ending the legacy of wars that the US had unleashed in the Middle East after the September 11 attacks resonated with a war-weary American public. But the self-declared “candidate of peace” is sleepwalking the US into multiple new conflicts because of his desire to project strength and to avoid pressuring Netanyahu into ending Israel’s wars, which rely on US weapons and political support.\n\nFor years, Trump has mused that he deserves to win the Nobel peace prize for brokering a series of diplomatic deals, known as the Abraham accords, between Israel and several Arab states during his first term as president. In his inaugural address on 20 January, Trump went even further than he had during the campaign in trying to establish himself as a global peacemaker in his second term. “We will measure our success not only by the battles we win but also by the wars that we end – and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into,” he said, adding: “My proudest legacy will be that of a peacemaker and unifier.”\n\nBut Trump is making little progress toward solving the biggest conflicts he pledged to tackle, partly because he has usually sided with the aggressor. In early March, days after Trump and the Ukrainian leader, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, had a televised shouting match in the White House, the president suspended all US military aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine. Trump argued he was using the suspension to force Zelenskyy to make concessions that would help the US broker a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. But Trump avoided pressuring Vladimir Putin, who had launched Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in 2022, to also make concessions.\n\nTrump restored military aid to the Ukrainians after Zelenskyy agreed to a series of US-brokered meetings, but Putin recently dismissed the latest US ceasefire proposals as unacceptable. With little pressure from Trump, Putin is insisting on truce terms that would force Ukraine to agree to demilitarize and pledge never to join Nato and to recognize Russian annexation of occupied territories, including Crimea. The deal would essentially dismantle Ukraine as an independent state.\n\nIn the same way, Trump has failed to use US leverage – billions of dollars in US arms shipments – to pressure Netanyahu not to resume Israel’s war on Gaza. In fact, as the Trump administration froze military aid to Ukraine last month, it approved $4bn in new weapons to Israel under the state department’s emergency authority. That meant those arms deals would bypass even a cursory review by members of Congress. The weapons approved by Trump include more than 35,000 US-made 2,000lb “bunker buster” bombs, which often kill and wound civilians indiscriminately when they’re dropped on population centers, as Israel has done repeatedly in its attacks on Gaza.\n\nAnd while Trump might have visions of securing his Nobel prize for brokering a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia – an expansion of the Abraham accords that eluded Joe Biden for four years – Trump would first need to stop the bloodshed in Gaza. Like Biden before him, Trump has shown little willingness to exert significant pressure on Netanyahu, who backed out of the US-brokered ceasefire with Hamas so that he could keep his rightwing coalition in power and avoid early parliamentary elections in Israel.\n\nSaudi Arabia’s crown prince and de facto ruler, Mohammed bin Salman, has made clear that he won’t agree to a diplomatic deal with Israel until the Israeli government commits to the establishment of a Palestinian state. Netanyahu, on the other hand, openly boasted last year that he had spent decades of his political career blocking the creation of a Palestinian state. Trump has also failed to expand the 2020 Abraham accords because they were mainly conceived and negotiated by Jared Kushner, the president’s son-in-law and senior adviser during his first term, who has stayed out of the White House this time.\n\nMore broadly, as long as the president fails to use the same kind of leverage and political power against Netanyahu that he deployed against Ukraine, his dream of a Nobel prize will remain elusive.\n\nAside from his failure to stop the wars in Ukraine and Gaza, Trump recently expanded a destructive conflict with the Houthi militia that controls most of Yemen. After Israel invaded Gaza following the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel, the Houthis began firing missiles and drones at cargo vessels crossing the Red Sea. The Houthis pledged to stop disrupting global shipping once Israel ended its war on Gaza – and they did so after Israel and Hamas agreed to a ceasefire in January. But after Israel imposed a new siege on 2 March, banning all food and other aid shipments into Gaza, the Houthis threatened to resume their attacks on Red Sea shipping lanes.\n\nIn response, the Trump administration launched a series of US airstrikes on 15 March throughout Yemen, which killed at least 53 people and injured nearly 100. The US attacks on Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen continued over the past three weeks, with no end in sight since Netanyahu shattered the Gaza ceasefire.\n\nTrump is repeating the same mistakes for which he excoriated Biden throughout the presidential campaign. For nearly a year starting in January 2024, Biden had tried – and failed – to bomb the Houthis into submission.\n\nAt the start of his own administration’s airstrikes against Yemen last year, reporters in Washington asked Biden if US attacks on Houthi targets were working. His answer perfectly encapsulated the kneejerk, and almost absurd, rationale behind the US’s forever wars. “When you say working, are they stopping the Houthis? No,” Biden said. “Are they going to continue? Yes.”\n\nIn an interview with the podcaster Tim Pool during last year’s campaign, Trump decried Biden’s bombing of Yemen as a failure – and he suggested trying to negotiate with the Houthis. “It’s crazy. You can solve problems over a telephone. Instead, they start dropping bombs,” Trump said. “You don’t have to do that. You can talk in such a way where they respect you and they listen to you.”\n\nNow back in power, the candidate of peace has instead decided to drop more US bombs on Yemen.\n\n Mohamad Bazzi is the director of the Hagop Kevorkian Center for Near Eastern Studies and a journalism professor at New York University","summary":"The US is bombing Houthi rebels and supporting Netanyahu’s campaigns as it sleepwalks into new conflicts\n\nThroughout the last presidential campaign, Donald Trump portrayed himself as the candidate who would bring peace to an unstable world.
