And Bukele, who has been a vital partner for the Trump administration in its deportation efforts, said he does not “have the power to return him to the United States.”\n\nThe Supreme Court has called for the Trump administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return.\n\nHere's the latest:\n\n Court filing from US officials says they don’t have authority to bring back Abrego Garcia \n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security says it cannot bring back Abrego Garcia from El Salvador after the nation’s president called the idea of sending him back “preposterous.”\n\nA Monday evening court filing from Joseph Mazzara, the acting general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security, said the Department of Homeland Security “does not have authority to forcibly extract” Abrego Garcia because he is “in the domestic custody of a foreign sovereign nation.”\n\nMazarra also said Abergo Garcia is “no longer eligible for withholding of removal” because the U.S. designated MS-13, the violent gang that two immigration court judges said Abrego Gargia was a member of, as a foreign terror organization. The man’s attorneys say the government has provided no evidence that he was affiliated with MS-13 or any other gang.\n\nEl Salvador’s president said “of course” he would not release Abrego Garcia back to U.S. soil.\n\n Justice Department Civil Rights Division lawyers get ‘deferred resignation’ offers \n\nLawyers in the division that enforces civil rights laws are being given an opportunity to voluntarily resign as part of the administration’s effort to downsize the federal workforce, according to a memo obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nThe White House had previously offered all federal workers a deferred resignation program allowing them to quit and be paid until Sept. 30.\n\nIn a memo sent Monday, Assistant Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon said eligible Civil Rights Division employees can now apply for a second round of the deferred resignation program.\n\nEmployees have through April 28 to apply. Those who aren’t eligible for the resignation offer include attorneys in the criminal section and political appointees, according to the memo.\n\n Schumer condemns Trump administration’s handling of Abrego Garcia \n\n“The Trump administration must facilitate and effectuate the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia. He should be returned to the U.S. immediately,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. “Due process and the rule of law are cornerstones of American society for citizens and noncitizens alike, and not to follow that is dangerous and outrageous. A threat to one is a threat to all.”\n\n Leader of immigration advocacy group calls Trump and Bukele’s remarks on Abrego Garcia ‘painful’ \n\n“The U.S. government should not be in the business of disappearing people or using the Alien Enemies Act — regardless of immigration status,” said Todd Schulte, president of FWD.us.\n\nHe said Congress must “be loud and unequivocal” in standing with the court and “in demanding that U.S. taxpayer dollars are no longer used to enforce prohibited deportations or to obstruct efforts to bring people like Mr. Garcia home.”\n\n White House proposes cutting State Department budget by almost 50% \n\nThe Office of Management and Budget also has suggested closing a number of overseas diplomatic missions and eliminating funding for nearly all international organizations, including the United Nations, many of its agencies and for NATO headquarters, officials said.\n\nThe proposal was presented to the State Department last week and is still in a highly preliminary phase. It isn’t expected to pass muster with either the department’s leadership or Congress.\n\nOfficials familiar with the proposal say it must still go through several rounds of review before it even gets to lawmakers, who in the past have amended and even rejected White House budget requests.\n\n▶ Read more about the potential cuts\n\n International students file legal challenges over widespread US visa revocations \n\nSeveral international students who have had their visas revoked in recent weeks have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration, arguing the government denied them due process when it suddenly took away their permission to be in the U.S.\n\nThe actions by the federal government to terminate students’ legal status have left hundreds of scholars at risk of detention and deportation.\n\nIn lawsuits against the Department of Homeland Security, students have argued the government lacked justification to cancel their visa or terminate their legal status.\n\nHomeland Security officials did not respond to a message seeking comment.\n\n▶ Read more about canceled visas for international students\n\n Confusion over Trump’s tariffs remains \n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration paused its new taxes on electronics imported into the U.S. — signaling some relief from trade wars that have particularly escalated with China, a major exporter of technology from smartphones to laptops. But these goods remain subject to other levies.\n\nOfficials have also indicated that additional, sector-specific tariffs targeting electronics are on the way — all of which economists warn will raise costs and lead to higher prices for consumers.\n\n▶ Read about what we know about Trump’s new tariffs regime\n\n Vance fumbles Ohio State’s trophy \n\nVice President JD Vance ended the Ohio State football team’s visit to the White House by fumbling the trophy the players had won as college football’s national champion.\n\nAfter a formal ceremony, Vance tried to lift the gold NAA championship trophy up along with its black base.\n\nAs he lifted them off the table, the base fell away and Vance dropped both.\n\nThe falling trophy was grabbed by OSU running back TreVeyon Henderson while Vance bent over to pick up the base.\n\nThe Marine Corps Band continued to play “We Are the Champions” despite an audible gasp from the crowd.\n\n Trump cheers on Buckeyes at White House celebration \n\nTrump welcomed members of the Ohio State University football team, which won the national championship this year.\n\n“This team showed the world that the road to greatness is paved by hard work, sweat and often a great deal of adversity,” Trump said.\n\nFlanked by dozens of beefy players, the president quipped that he would invite them into the Oval Office but said, “I don’t know if the floor can withstand it.”\n\n US Treasury secretary commends Argentina during meeting \n\nIn Buenos Aires on Monday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent “commended Argentina for moving quickly to negotiate with the United States on a package of reciprocal trade measures,” according to a Treasury readout of the meeting between Bessent and Argentine finance minister Luis Caputo.\n\nTrump’s recent sweeping tariff package included 10% on Argentina, though on Wednesday he announced a 90-day pause on the tariffs for most countries except China. Bessent also met with Argentine President Javier Milei on Monday.\n\nMilei announced Friday that he would lift most of the country’s strict capital and currency controls this week, a high-stakes gamble made possible by a new loan from the International Monetary Fund.\n\n US Army to control land on Mexico border as part of base, migrants could be detained, officials say \n\nA long sliver of federal land along the U.S.-Mexico border that Trump is turning over to the Department of Defense would be controlled by the Army as part of a base, which could allow troops to detain any trespassers, including migrants, U.S. officials told The Associated Press.\n\nThe transfer of that border zone to military control — and making it part of an Army installation — is an attempt by the Trump administration to get around a federal law that prohibits U.S. troops from being used in domestic law enforcement on American soil.\n\nBut if the troops are providing security for land that’s part of an Army base, they can perform that function. However, at least one presidential powers expert said the move is likely to be challenged in the courts.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public, said the issue is still under review in the Pentagon, but even as any legal review goes on, the administration’s intent is to have troops detain migrants at the border.\n\n▶ Read more about the military at the U.S.-Mexico border\n\n— Tara Copp and Lolita C. Baldor\n\n Trump reiterates desire to expand deportation plans to include US citizens \n\nThe president has said openly that he’d also favor El Salvador taking custody of American citizens who’ve committed violent crimes, a view he repeated Monday.\n\n“We have bad ones too, and I’m all for it because we can do things with the president for less money and have great security,” Trump said during the meeting with Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador. “And we have a huge prison population.” It is unclear how lawful U.S. citizens could be deported elsewhere in the world.\n\nBefore the press entered the Oval Office, Trump said in a video posted on social media by Bukele that he wanted to send “homegrowns” to be incarcerated in El Salvador, and added that “you’ve got to build five more places,” suggesting Bukele doesn’t have enough prison capacity for all the U.S. citizens Trump would like to send there.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s plans to expand deportation\n\n Justice Department charges man with arson at New Mexico Tesla dealership and GOP headquarters \n\nThat’s according to court records unsealed Monday.\n\nA criminal complaint charges Jamison R. Wagner, 40, with federal arson charges in connection with the vandalism in February at a Tesla showroom in Bernalillo, New Mexico, where authorities found two Tesla Model Y vehicles ablaze as well as spray-painted graffiti messages including “Die Elon” and “Die Tesla Nazi.”\n\nElon Musk is the billionaire CEO of Tesla and close ally of Trump. He's helped engineer a massive downsizing of the federal government and purge of employees.\n\nThe arrest is part of a federal crackdown on what Attorney General Pam Bondi has described as a wave of domestic terrorism against property carrying the logo of Musk’s electric-car company.\n\n▶ Read more about vandalism against Tesla\n\n DC mayor says budgets cuts would be needed without action by Congress \n\nThe mayor of the nation’s capital says the city is raising its stalled budget as much as possible under authority granted by federal law, but it would still need to cut more than $410 million this fiscal year without action from Congress.\n\nDC Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that she’d sent a letter to the House and Senate Appropriations Committee to notify them.\n\nThe move comes days after the House adjourned for a two-week recess without acting on a $1.1 billion hole in the city’s budget, despite directives from Trump to address the issue.\n\n“We believed that the fix would happen, and we wouldn’t be running around planning for cuts,” Bowser said Monday at a news conference.\n\nShe said the city is raising the budget 6%, as much as possible under federal statute, but the situation remains frustrating, with no options “off the table.”\n\nSenior officials with Bowser’s office said the law changing the budget requires council approval, but not congressional. They added that the remaining cuts would likely affect all city services, including public safety.\n\n Meta faces historic antitrust trial that could force it to break off Instagram and WhatsApp \n\nA historic antitrust trial is underway Monday for Meta Platforms Inc. in a case that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.\n\nIn opening statements, Federal Trade Commission attorney Daniel Matheson said Meta has used a monopoly to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups because the company feared they were a threat to Meta’s dominance. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta witnesses will testify during the trial.\n\nThe trial will be the first big test of Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.\n\n▶ Read more about Meta’s antitrust trial\n\n Despite a court order, the White House bars the AP from Oval Office event \n\nDespite a court order, a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press were barred from an Oval Office news conference on Monday with Trump and his counterpart from El Salvador, Nayib Bukele.\n\nLast week’s federal court decision forbidding the Trump administration from punishing the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico was to take effect Monday. The administration is appealing the decision and arguing with the news outlet over whether it needs to change anything until those appeals are exhausted.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit set a Thursday hearing on Trump’s request that any changes be delayed while case is reviewed. The AP is fighting for more access as soon as possible.\n\n▶ Read more about the dispute between the Trump administration and the AP\n\n Sen. Chris Van Hollen says he’ll travel to El Salvador if Abrego Garcia isn’t released by midweek \n\nThe Democratic senator from Maryland wrote to El Salvadoran diplomats to “urgently request” meeting with the country’s president, Nayib Bukele, to discuss the potential return of a former Maryland resident, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to the Central American nation by the Trump administration.\n\nA federal judge ruled Garcia should be returned to the U.S., a decision that was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court last week.\n\n“If Kilmar is not home by midweek — I plan to travel to El Salvador this week to check on his condition and discuss his release,” Van Hollen wrote in a letter address to El Salvador’s ambassador to Washington.\n\nEl Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said during a Monday Oval Office meeting that he did not intend to return Kilmar to the U.S.\n\n Emboldened anti-abortion faction wants women who have abortions to face criminal charges \n\nAdvocates involved in the abortion debate are warning about the widening influence of a movement that seeks to outlaw all abortions and enforce the ban with criminal prosecution of any women who have abortions.\n\nMainstream anti-abortion groups have largely shied away from legislation that would punish women for having abortions, but abortion abolitionists believe abortion should be considered homicide and punished with the full force of the law.\n\nSo far this year, bills introduced in at least 12 states — Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas — would allow prosecutors to charge those who have abortions with homicide. In some of those states, women could be subject to the death penalty if the bills were to become law.\n\n“With the reversal of Roe v. Wade, now states can pass the most severe abortion bans, which has galvanized the anti-abortion movement as a whole, including this part of it,” said Rachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia. “Certainly the fall of Roe has brought abortion abolitionists one step closer to what they want — banning abortion nationwide.”\n\n▶ Read more about the movement to charge women who have abortions\n\n Air Force Gen. Dan Caine has been sworn in as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n\nThat’s nearly two months after Trump fired his predecessor.\n\nA formal White House ceremony is expected this week.\n\nCaine, a decorated F-16 fighter pilot and well-respected officer, took over the role Saturday and was at the Pentagon over the weekend after Trump signed the necessary documents to allow him to fill the job.\n\nHe’ll serve the remainder of the four-year term of Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., who was fired by Trump as part of a broader purge of military officers believed to endorse diversity and equity programs.\n\n El Salvador’s leader shares an inside look at meeting with Trump \n\nBefore the press entered the Oval Office, Trump and Bukele chatted in a video posted on social media by the leader of El Salvador.\n\nThe U.S. president said he wanted to send “homegrowns” to be incarcerated in El Salvador, and he suggested “you’ve got to build five more places,” suggesting Bukele doesn’t have enough prison capacity for all of the U.S. citizens Trump would like to send there.\n\nTrump also praised Bukele for his team’s slickly produced video of migrants arriving in El Salvador after being deported by the U.S.\n\n“That’s what people want to see. Respect. They want to see respect,” Trump said.\n\nHe added, “you’ve got a good team. Can I use them?”\n\nBukele said “it’s like a movie, but it’s real.”\n\n Former President Biden to make first public speech since leaving White House on Tuesday in Chicago \n\nBiden will address the national conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled.\n\nThe former president has kept a very low profile since leaving office Jan. 20 — despite Trump scoffing repeatedly at his predecessor’s mental competency.\n\nOrganizers of the conference say participants are “committed to safeguarding and strengthening Social Security for the generations to come.”\n\nTrump has pledged to shield Social Security from possible cuts, even as Democrats say it, and other federal entitlements like Medicare, could face funding trims to help offset tax reductions the administration supports.\n\n Trump says he plans to provide temporary exemptions to automakers on his tariffs \n\nAnd the president said he’s talked with Apple CEO Tim Cook, whose company could be hurt if the China tariffs become permanent.\n\n“They need a little bit of time,” Trump said of the automakers that would have to upend their supply chains to reduce their exposure to Trump’s import taxes.\n\nTrump also said he had talked to Cook and “helped” him by exempting electronics from some of his China tariffs.\n\n“I don’t want to hurt anybody but the end result is we’re going to get to the position of greatness for our country,” said Trump.\n\nThe U.S. president also theorized that China and Vietnam were meeting “to figure out: how do we screw the United States of America?”\n\n Seizing on the March consumer price index, Trump says he’s fixed inflation \n\n“We already solved inflation,” Trump told reporters gathered Monday in the Oval Office.\n\nThe U.S. president was touting the 2.4% annual inflation rate seen in the monthly consumer price report released last Thursday. Many economists are hesitant to claim a single report makes up a broader trend. Many economists and consumers worry Trump’s tariffs will cause prices to go up in ways that hurt the economy.\n\nAn earlier version of this item incorrectly said the report came out Monday instead of last Thursday.\n\n Trump suggests Iran is ‘tapping us along’ \n\nThe president expressed some impatience at the pace of nuclear negotiations with Iran.\n\n“I think they’re tapping us along,” he said.\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled for this coming weekend.\n\n“These are radicalized people. And they cannot have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said.\n\n Trump is again praising his own health after undergoing an annual physical \n\nHe says the results indict “you’ve got me for a little longer.”\n\nThe president spent hours Friday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He said after it that testing went well.\n\nA medical report on the physical was released Sunday. But Trump brought up the test again a day later, telling reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that he did well on a cognitive exam performed as part of it.\n\n“I like taking them because they’re not too tough for me to take,” Trump said of cognitive tests. He said his health was good enough that he should be around for years or at the very least “a little longer.”\n\n Bondi: US would provide plane if El Salvador returns Abrego Garcia, which Bukele called ‘preposterous’ \n\nTrump referred questions about Abrego Garcia to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who said he was illegally in the U.S. and that courts have ruled that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang.\n\n“That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s not up to us,” Bondi said.\n\nShe called the issue “international matters” and “foreign affairs” and said the U.S. would facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return of El Salvador wanted to send him back by providing an airplane.\n\nBukele was asked if he plans to return Abrego Garcia and he asked how he could return him and said it was “preposterous.” He called Abrego Garcia “a terrorist” and that he had no power to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.\n\nIn a complaint, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have disputed the government’s claims that he was in a gang.\n\n Trump: Man accused of setting fire to Pennsylvania governor’s mansion is ‘probably just a whack job’ \n\nThe president was asked about Cody Balmer, who police say broke into the mansion, set a fire that caused significant damage and forced Gov. Josh Shapiro, his family and guests to evacuate the building during the Jewish holiday of Passover. He said, “The attacker was not a fan of Trump.”\n\nTrump’s comments came in the Oval Office as he met with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.\n\nTrump added, “The attacker basically wasn’t a fan of anybody” and also noted, “A thing like that cannot be allowed to happen.”\n\n Trump declines to criticize Russia for the recent strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy \n\nTrump criticized former President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but not Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\n“If Biden were competent and if Zelenskyy were competent . . . that war should’ve never been allowed to happen,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n\nReferring to Putin, Trump said “I’m not saying anybody’s an angel.”\n\nTrump has previously described the strike on Sumy as a “mistake.” On Monday, he said the mistake was allowing the war to start in the first place.\n\n“Biden could’ve stopped it and Zelenskyy could’ve stopped it and Putin should’ve never started it,” he said. “Everybody’s to blame.”\n\n Trump and Bukele discuss transgender athletes, which Bukele calls ‘violence’ \n\nTrump and Bukele quickly got into a discussion about transgender athletes in the White House, with the U.S. president asking his counterpart from El Salvador, “Do you allow men to play in women’s sports?”\n\n“That’s violence,” Bukele responded.\n\nTrump said there are people in the U.S. who “fight to the death” to allow transgender athletes to play and Bukele said, “We’re big on protecting women.”\n\nThough Trump frequently speaks about transgender athletes, he said, “I don’t like talking about it because I want to save it for just before the next election.”\n\n Trump meets with Salvadoran president in the Oval Office \n\nTrump is meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office, telling the visiting head of state “you are helping us out” by holding migrants deported from the United States in a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nTrump said his administration’s hard-line policies have restored order along the U.S.-Mexico border. He said of the changes, “We’re proud of them. Now we just need to get the criminals and murders and rapists”out of “our country.”\n\n Bukele arrives at the White House \n\nTrump greeted Bukele at the White House on Monday and ignored shouted questions from reporters about Abrego Garcia.\n\nThe president shook Bukele’s hand and directed the leader of El Salvador toward waiting reporters to pose for pictures and Trump pumped his fist.\n\nThey then went inside together.\n\n Trump’s schedule for Monday \n\nThis morning, the president is meeting with the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. After the meeting, they will have lunch together. This afternoon, at 3 p.m., Trump will meet with The Ohio State University football team, the 2025 College National Football champions.\n\n Some top tech leaders have embraced Trump. That’s created a political divide in Silicon Valley \n\nLike many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy.\n\nThe only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Trump’s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company’s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google’s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them.\n\nLast weekend was Lyons’ second, also against Trump, but it had a different feel.\n\nThe man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who wouldn’t give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley’s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several joined Trump at his inauguration.\n\nTo Lyons, the change says as much about what’s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays.\n\n“One of the things I’ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,” Lyons said.\n\n▶ Read more about Silicon Valley’s political divide\n\n US funding cuts have halted or threatened aid programs in Syria \n\nThat includes health and nutrition services for displaced people and child protection for children in notorious camps housing the families of alleged Islamic State members.\n\nWhile funding cut from the World Food Program in Syria was restored, other cuts remain, including nearly $12 million from Save the Children and nearly $2 million from World Vision.\n\nWorld Vision Syria Response Director Emmanuel Isch said the organization has largely halted a health and nutrition program serving 30,000 to 40,000 internally displaced people, many of whom “have limited access to basic services.”\n\nSave the Children Country Director Bujar Hoxha said it has reprogrammed funding to continue case management for unaccompanied minors in the al-Hol and al-Roj camps and programs for malnourished children in different parts of Syria.\n\n“But that is for very limited timeline,” he said, noting that within a few weeks “we have to either find a way to continue funding, or we have to close it down.”\n\n Trump says ‘I just got here’ despite pledge to end Ukraine war before taking office \n\nTrump issued a statement on social media over the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying he had “NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS WAR.”\n\nDespite his repeated promise as a candidate that he’d have the Russia-Ukraine war settled within 24 hours — even before taking office — he said Monday: “I just got here.”\n\n“The War between Russia and Ukraine is Biden’s war, not mine. I just got here, and for four years during my term, had no problem in preventing it from happening,” Trump said.\n\nTrump last month said he’d been “a little bit sarcastic” when he had past pledged he’d resolve the war.\n\n Top White House aide says Abrego Garcia’s fate is up to El Salvador \n\nAhead of Trump’s meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a top White House aide signaled the U.S. president wouldn’t be asking his counterpart to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\n\n“It’s up to El Salvador and to the government and the people of El Salvador what the fate of their own citizens is,” Stephen Miller, a deputy chief of staff, told reporters at the White House on Monday morning. “We can’t extradite citizens of foreign countries to our country over the objection of those countries.”\n\n Senator seeks meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele over Abrego Garcia’s return \n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen says he plans to travel to El Salvador this week if Abrego Garcia, a constituent, isn’t returned by that time.\n\n“Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia never should have been abducted and illegally deported, and the courts have made clear: the Administration must bring him home, now,” the Maryland Democrat said in a statement.\n\nHe said that since the Trump administration “appears to be ignoring these court mandates,” more action is needed.\n\n Wall Street joins a global rally after Trump exempts some electronics from tariffs \n\nStocks are rallying worldwide after Trump relaxed some of his tariffs, for now at least.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 1.7% higher in early trading Monday. It’s coming off a chaotic week where it careened through historic swings as markets struggled to catch up with Trump’s moves on tariffs.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 434 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite was up 2.5%. Apple, Nvidia and other big technology companies led the way on Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and some other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs.\n\n▶ Read more about the financial markets\n\n A key ally in Trump’s migrant crackdown is coming for a visit \n\nTrump is hosting Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, at the White House on Monday as the small Central American nation becomes a critical linchpin of the U.S. administration’s mass deportation operation.\n\nSince March, El Salvador has accepted from the U.S. more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants — whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes — and placed them inside the country’s notorious maximum-security gang prison just outside of the capital, San Salvador. It’s also holding a Maryland man who the administration admits was wrongly deported but has not been returned to the U.S., despite court orders to do so.\n\nThat has made Bukele, who remains extremely popular in El Salvador due in part to the crackdown on the country’s powerful street gangs, a vital ally for the Trump administration, which has offered little evidence for its claims that the Venezuelan immigrants were in fact gang members, nor has it released names of those deported.\n\n▶ Read more about El Salvador President Nayib Bukele\n\n White House responds to China on rare earths \n\nKevin Hassett, a top economic adviser to Trump, said China’s decision to stop exports of some rare earth minerals was “concerning.”\n\nRare earths are critical ingredients for technology and electronic manufacturing.\n\n“The rare earth limits are being studied very carefully, and they’re concerning, and we’re thinking about all the options right now,” Hassett told reporters outside the White House.\n\nHe spoke to Fox Business earlier in the morning, where he said the administration was “100% not” expecting a recession as Trump disrupts global trade with his tariff plans.\n\n Trump says CBS and ’60 Minutes’ should ‘pay a big price’ for going after him \n\nTrump bitterly attacked “60 Minutes” shortly after the CBS News magazine broadcast stories on Ukraine and Greenland on Sunday, saying the network was out of control and should “pay a big price” for going after him.\n\n“Almost every week, 60 Minutes ... mentions the name ‘TRUMP’ in a derogatory and defamatory way, but this Weekend’s ‘BROADCAST’ tops them all,” the president said on his Truth Social platform. He called on Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr to impose maximum fines and punishment “for their unlawful and illegal behavior.”\n\nThe network had no immediate comment.\n\nTrump has an ongoing $20 billion lawsuit against “60 Minutes” for how it edited an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris last fall. The president claims it was edited in a way to make Harris look good, something the newscast denies. But there are ongoing reports that Trump’s lawyers and CBS’ parent company are involved in settlement talks.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s comments on “60 Minutes”","summary":"President Donald Trump’s top advisers and Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, said Monday that they had no basis for the small Central American nation to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongly deported there last month","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/nayib-bukele-donald-trump-el-salvador-white-house-jd-vance-b2733295.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/04/15/00/Trump_US_El_Salvador_91963.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 23:01:47","author":"The Associated Press","authors":["The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":311159032,"title":"Just Another Lawless Monday","text":"On a particularly lawless Monday, President Trump defied a Supreme Court order on live TV, barred the Associated Press from that event in defiance of a different court order and prompted a fired agency chair to ask for intensive questioning of officials under oath following the government’s alleged violation of yet another court order. \n\nSince the beginning of Trump’s term, it’s been a matter of when, and not if, the administration would ignore a judge’s unfriendly ruling. Some, including elected officials, have shifted the Overton window to when it’ll defy a Supreme Court order, as if ignoring a lower judge is a lesser catastrophe. \n\nBy either metric, the crisis is here. Trump, beaming alongside strongman Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, performed in a little two-man show where both feigned an inability to retrieve Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an innocent man the administration admitted that it deported to Bukele’s torture prison by accident. Stephen Miller, high on the brutality, chimed in to lie about what the Supreme Court had ordered — a 9-0 ruling that the administration had to “facilitate” Garcia’s return. \n\nOutside the Oval Office meeting, the administration was busy defying another court order — keeping an AP reporter and photographer out of the Trump-Bukele meeting, despite a federal judge’s order returning the outlet to the press pool. The AP exclusion has been ongoing since February, a fit of pique at the outlet’s decision not to use Trump’s favored “Gulf of America” over the “Gulf of Mexico.” \n\nLater the same day, a new filing hit the docket in Brehm v. Marocco, in which lawyers for the fired chair of the United States African Development Foundation (USADF) call for testimony from and cross examination of DOGE members and Pete Marocco, the administration official who unwound USAID and was put into place to do the same at USADF. The plaintiffs write that Marocco lied to the court about having fired additional USADF employees and terminating grants, accusing the government of having “ignored this Court’s instructions.”\n\nAfter so many years of conservatives stacking the courts and smoothing the pipeline of right-wing legal thought, Trump has found it more efficient to simply ignore the courts altogether. Further proceedings, particularly in the Abrego Garcia case, will reveal the extent of the courts’ appetite to try to punish him for taking a jackhammer to the foundation of our government. \n\nBut these are dark days. Only four months into his term, and Trump is molding the American presidency into something ever closer to the grinning dictator seated next to him in the Oval Office Monday. \n\n— Kate Riga\n\nTrump Wants CBS To ‘Pay A Big Price’ \n\nIt’s for the sin of reporting on the on-the-ground devastation of Russia’s ongoing war on Ukraine, it seems. After CBS’s “60 Minutes” aired its segment this weekend — it involved correspondent Scott Pelley traveling to Ukraine to interview Volodymyr Zelensky and visit the site of a Russian attack where nine children were killed this month — Trump posted on Truth Social, calling on his FCC chair Brendan Carr to fine and punish the news network. It’s an escalation of his ongoing attacks on CBS News and other news outlets, which include blocking the AP from the Oval Office event Monday, openly defying a court order. \n\nTrump has been engaged in a $20 billion lawsuit against “60 Minutes” for some time, angered by how the network edited an interview with Kamala Harris. The FCC under Carr’s leadership has already launched its own version of an investigation into the interview, which Trump claims made Harris look good.\n\nWhite House Forcing Its DOGE Will On Congress\n\nAs I noted earlier this month, it appears that the White House is going to formally request that Congress turn its lawless DOGE rampage into formal legislative action — creating a backwards, aconstitutional situation where the executive branch is dictating how the legislative branch legislates. It appears these so called “recissions” will specifically target the budget for NPR and the State Department, according to Politico: \n\nThe White House will soon ask Congress to cancel $9.3 billion already approved for foreign aid initiatives, public broadcasting and other programs, according to a White House official granted anonymity to speak freely.\n\nCongress is expected to receive that so-called rescissions request when lawmakers return from their two-week recess later this month. To nix the funding, the House and Senate will each have to vote at a simple-majority threshold to approve the formal ask.\n\nHarvard Will Not Bend The Knee\n\nIn a message to the university on Monday, the university President Alan Garber announced that Harvard would not give in to demands from the Trump administration — involving gutting diversity programs, cracking down on student protests, cooperating with DHS on campus and letting the government conduct audits — in exchange for keeping its federal funding. \n\n“No government — regardless of which party is in power — should dictate what private universities can teach, whom they can admit and hire, and which areas of study and inquiry they can pursue,” he wrote, per the Harvard Crimson student newspaper.\n\nIn Case You Missed It \n\nYesterday’s Most Read Story \n\nWhat We Are Reading","summary":"On a particularly lawless Monday, President Trump defied a Supreme Court order on live TV, barred the Associated Press from...","url":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/where-things-stand/just-another-lawless-monday","image":"https://talkingpointsmemo.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-2209710357.jpg?w=804","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 22:43:57","author":"Nicole Lafond","authors":["Nicole Lafond"],"language":"en","category":"business","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":311168426,"title":"'Bad news for the White House': Democrats are now tied with the GOP on key Trump issue","text":"An April poll shows President Donald Trump is losing his biggest polling advantage over Democrats. \n\n“Bad news for the White House per @EchelonInsights,” wrote Snapchat host Peter Hamby. “Dems are now tied with Republicans on the question of who would do a better job on inflation and the cost of living.”\n\nDigital monitoring company Echelon Insights' April 2025 Voter Omnibus package revealed that \"on the issue of inflation and cost of living,\" Trump and Democrats now share 43% approval.

She just can’t help herself.”\n\nA spokesperson for Jeffries said in a statement: “Leader Jeffries has repeatedly and publicly made clear that he and House Democrats are proud to stand on the historic shoulders of Nancy D’Alesandro Pelosi.”\n\nDespite having just turned 85, the Speaker Emerita – as Pelosi calls herself – has already filed paperwork in November to run for Congress in 2026 and has nearly $10 million in her campaign coffers, according to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nWith a personal net worth estimated at $250 million and 20-terms as a congresswoman, younger members of the party feel Pelosi has become the very embodiment of the well-heeled corporate Democrat, an image they desperately want to shake.\n\n“I really feel like the Democrats actually need to become a party that’s fighting tooth and nail for the working class and middle class right now,” said Saikat Chakrabarti, 39, one of her opponents in the 2026 Democratic primary.\n\nChakrabarti explained how after the 2024 election he was expecting changes. Instead, he listened to Pelosi tell a New York Times podcaster everything would be status quo.\n\n“She basically made the case for how the Democrats don’t really need to change,” Chakrabarti told Rolling Stone. “You know, that they ran a great race, did their best, and nothing needs to change. That was the first warning sign to me.”\n\nChakrabarti is a software engineer and progressive political advisor who was formerly chief of staff to New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, where he was an architect of her doomed Green New Deal environmental initiative.\n\nHis points are echoed by Jake Rakov, 37, who is running for a seat in Southern California. He is one of surprisingly few California Democrats contacted by The Post who is unafraid to step out of line and criticize party leadership.\n\n“I am running because the Democratic Party needs a new generation to step up,” Rakov told The Post last week. “Nancy Pelosi has been there for a great long time, and she has done amazing things, but right now we need new energy for Congress.”\n\nRakov, a former communications consultant, is challenging the seat of Brad Sherman, 70, who has been in Congress for nearly 30 years. He also used to work as an aide to Sherman at one time.\n\nRakov said he is refusing to take corporate Political Action Committee money for his campaign to avoid being beholden to any business interests.\n\nHe is also running on a pledge to impose term limits on Congress, limiting lawmakers to five terms. “It was never meant to be a lifelong career,” he added.\n\nIf Pelosi were to pass the baton to a younger candidate in her district, she would likely step down midway through a term then back her daughter, Christine Pelosi, in a special election for her seat, according to a Democratic campaign finance expert who did not want to be identified.\n\n“If I had to guess about Pelosi’s next move, I would say she is preparing to resign and give the seat to her daughter,” the expert said.\n\nChristine Pelosi, 58, is a Democratic political strategist, author and former Women’s Caucus Chair of the Democratic Party in California. She also served as Special Counsel of the US Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Clinton/Gore administration in 1999-2001.\n\nBrown, 91, told The Post he has known Pelosi – the first woman to occupy the House Speaker’s chair, in 2007-2011 and again in 2019-2023 – for more than 50 years.\n\nHe saw her at an event in San Francisco last month, although the two did not speak about politics, and he doesn’t think she will step down soon.\n\n“Nobody matches her with the speakership skills that Nancy is blessed with. She is awesome in every way,” he added.\n\nIn addition to contemplating her future in politics, the octogenarian is still helping her venture capitalist husband Paul recover from an attack by a deranged intruder who broke into the family’s San Francisco home in 2022 and bashed him with a hammer.\n\nDavid DePape, the conspiracy theory crazed attacker, initially said he was looking for Nancy after he broke in and found her husband asleep in bed. He was sentenced to life without parole in October.\n\nThe couple also recently raised eyebrows when Paul Pelosi made $38 million worth of stock trades in the weeks before Trump took office in January.\n\nPaul Pelosi sold $24 million worth of Apple stock as well as $5 million worth of shares in AI chip-maker Nvidia. Both of the transactions were executed on New Year’s Eve, according to government filings. Nancy Pelosi is legally required to disclose her husband’s stock trades.\n\nIn the past her husband’s stock trades, which have been noted as particularly timely investments before key legislative actions, have sparked ongoing debates about potential conflicts of interest and the need for stricter regulations on lawmakers’ financial activities.\n\nPelosi initially opposed proposals for lawmakers and their spouses to be banned from trading stocks — insisting her husband makes stock trades independently and that she has no involvement in his business dealings.","summary":"“I really feel like the Democrats actually need to become a party that’s fighting tooth and nail for the working class and middle class right now,” said Saikat Chakrabarti, 39, one of Pelosi's opponents in the 2026 Democratic primary.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/14/us-news/nancy-pelosi-refusing-to-step-down-embodying-problem-with-dem-leadership-sources/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/newspress-collage-90rqi24el-1744663769758.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1744649537&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/yXdAtvfF-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-14 22:05:34","author":"Isabel Vincent","authors":["Isabel Vincent"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":311150330,"title":"Police arrest man for ‘arson’ at US Democrat’s residence","text":"WASHINGTON (AFP) – United States (US) police said they had arrested a man for alleged arson and “terrorism” after an attack at the official residence of Democratic heavyweight and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.\n\nShapiro, widely viewed as a potential 2028 presidential contender, was inside with his family when the fire broke out in a different part of the Georgian-style mansion in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, state police said.\n\n“While the fire was successfully extinguished, it caused a significant amount of damage to a portion of the residence,” the force said in a statement. No casualties were reported.\n\nShapiro said that he and his sleeping family were woken up by a police trooper who “banged on our door” at around 2am and that they were evacuated from the building.\n\n“Thank goodness no one was injured and the fire was extinguished,” he said.\n\nSpeaking to reporters outside the residence, a broken window blackened by the fire visible behind him, Shapiro made a forceful appeal for an end to political violence.\n\n“This kind of violence is becoming far too common in our society, and I don’t give a damn if it’s coming from one particular side or the other… it is not OK, and it has to stop,” he said.\n\nWhile noting the arsonist’s motive was not yet known, Shapiro said he would not be intimidated. Police said they arrested a man suspected of having carried out the attack, naming him as Cody Balmer, 38.\n\n“Cody Balmer is in custody. We are preparing a criminal complaint to charge him,” said district attorney Fran Chardo, adding that the charges would include “attempted murder, terrorism, aggravated arson and aggravated assault against an enumerated person.”\n\nThe term “enumerated person” is usually used for law enforcement officers or other public officials. Authorities said Balmer accessed the property by coming over a fence, and that he had “homemade incendiary devices” on his person.\n\nHe spent several minutes on the property evading police before he broke in and set the fire, top state police officials Christopher Paris and George Bivens said. Top Republican officials reacted to the attack yesterday afternoon, with US Attorney General Pam Bondi saying on X she was “deeply relieved that Governor Shapiro and his family are safe.”\n\nThe 51-year-old Shapiro was in the race to be Democrat Kamala Harris’ running mate in her ultimately unsuccessful US presidential bid – a position that instead went to Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. Shapiro, an assertive political centrist, was elected governor of Pennsylvania in 2022 when he faced off against a far-right candidate backed by Trump.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/police-arrest-man-for-arson-at-us-democrats-residence/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/page-28-b_15042025.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 22:01:19","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":-0.479},{"id":311159558,"title":"Trump threatens press freedom by defying court order","text":"President Donald Trump is escalating his war on the media—this time by backing an appeal to a judge’s ruling that forced the White House to reinstate The Associated Press’ press credentials. \n\nLast week, U.S. District Court Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, ordered the administration to let the AP back in after it kicked reporters out for refusing to call the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.” The ruling went into effect Monday, but AP reporters and photographers were still being locked out of Oval Office events, according to others in the press corps as well as the AP itself, as of midday Monday.\n\nThis isn’t just petty—it’s calculated. The strategy’s clear: Bully the press into compliance, and if that doesn’t work, slam the door shut. Outlets that hold the line—like the AP—get punished. Ones that cozy up to Trump, like The Washington Post, get a pat on the head and a few flattering social media posts.\n\nNotably, Trump didn’t stop with the AP. \n\nOver the weekend, he threw a tantrum about CBS News and “60 Minutes” because the show aired two segments he didn’t like: one featuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and another digging into Trump’s long-running fantasy of buying Greenland. You know, the Danish autonomous territory full of actual people who want nothing to do with him or anyone from his administration?\n\n“They should lose their license!” he raged online. “Hopefully, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as headed by its Highly Respected Chairman, Brendan Carr, will impose the maximum fines and punishment, which is substantial, for their unlawful and illegal behavior. CBS is out of control, at levels never seen before, and they should pay a big price for this. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nThe irony, of course, is that Trump still hasn’t pointed to a single thing CBS got wrong. But facts don’t matter when you’re trying to turn the press into a punching bag and whip up another culture war.\n\nIt’s convenient, really. Trump is under fire after a series of confusing—and sometimes contradictory—tariff announcements tanked the stock markets and spooked economists into warning of a looming recession. What better time to spin the narrative and cast the press—whether it be the AP or CBS—as public enemy No. 1?\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has had little to say about an actual problem: the arson at the Pennsylvania governor’s residence and attempted murder of Gov. Josh Shapiro. Police arrested a 38-year-old man who admitted he planned to attack Shapiro with a sledgehammer. When asked about it on Monday, Trump brushed it off, calling the suspect “just a whack job.” Trump also made sure to claim the alleged arsonist “was not a fan of Trump.”\n\nThat appears to have been Trump’s first public comment on the arson—after spending the entire weekend silent. Why? Because he was too busy foaming at the mouth over his press coverage. As usual, nothing matters more to him than controlling the narrative.\n\nThis isn’t even the first time Trump’s gone after CBS. He’s suing “60 Minutes” for $10 billion over an interview with former Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris that Trump claims was edited to make her look good—something the network denies. The Federal Communications Commission, with Trump’s backing, recently announced it would investigate the network.\n\nTrump’s also gone after ABC News and NBC News, both for allegedly giving Harris preferential treatment during the 2024 campaign. ABC even folded with a legal settlement before Trump’s second term officially began.\n\nThis is where we are. In a presidency overflowing with power grabs, this latest attack on the free press is another move in the authoritarian playbook. The AP’s allies better show up now—because if the press doesn’t push back, they’re not just giving up ground.

Laura Loomer is a \"far-right celebrity\" who describes herself as a \"proud Islamophobe,\" claims 9/11 was an inside job, and said a Kamala Harris White House would \"smell like curry.\" She has no official role in the Trump administration, and even ardent Trump loyalists call her \"toxic,\" but what she does have is Trump's ear. So, when she sat down last week for a meeting in the Oval Office, armed with a list of National Security Council officials she considered disloyal \"neo-cons,\" Trump seemingly listened. The next day, at least six staffers were fired, followed by Gen. Timothy Haugh, the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command chief. Trump denied Loomer's role, but if she truly had nothing to do with it, the timing of their meeting is one \"hell of a coincidence.\" Loomer was happy to take credit, said Josh Meyer in USA Today. She thanked Trump for acting on her advice about Haugh and vowed to expose more officials with \"questionable loyalty.\"\n\nLoomer's influence is \"supposed to be shocking,\" but there's nothing surprising about it, said Issie Lapowsky in Vanity Fair. Trump himself is a conspiracy theorist who has embraced \"political paranoia\" relentlessly for decades, and Loomer knows \"what matters to him.\" Trump can abide almost any malfeasance in his backers. Sexual-assault allegations against Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth don't matter to the president, for example. But being charged, even in Loomer's kangaroo court, \"with something less than total fealty is a non-starter.\" Trump admits he's not a trusting person, and that \"breeds a voracious appetite for stories of nefarious plots hiding in plain sight.\" Loomer whispering about turncoats \"whets that appetite.\"\n\nTrump should be careful about surrounding himself with sycophants, said The Wall Street Journal in an editorial. His first-term advisers were willing to challenge his isolationist impulses, and those debates yielded good results, as when a U.S. drone strike killed Iranian General Qassem Soleimani in 2020. Loomer's favored \"abandon-the-world\" faction \"would never have had the wisdom\" to pull that off. Instead, they could drive Trump into a bad nuclear deal with Tehran, a weak peace agreement in Ukraine, and a failure to deter China from attacking Taiwan. There are real-world consequences to purges like this.

Rogers Takes Another Shot at Michigan Senate Race","text":"Former Rep. Mike Rogers, R-Mich., on Monday announced his 2026 run for the soon-to-be-vacated Senate seat of retiring Michigan Democrat Sen. Gary Peters. \n\nRogers, a veteran of Michigan politics, who lost to Sen. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., in his 2024 Senate run, represented Michigan’s 8th Congressional District from 2001 to 2015.\n\nHe lost by fewer than 20,000 votes in 2024 in the Wolverine State, whereas Donald Trump defeated then-Vice President Kamala Harris by 80,000 votes for the presidency.\n\nIn his campaign announcement video Monday, Rogers repeatedly emphasized his alignment with Trump’s agenda\n\n“I’ll stand with President Trump, and we will deliver on the mandate given to him by the American people,” he said.\n\nRogers closely allied himself with the Trump campaign in 2024, seeking to benefit from the expansion of the Republican coalition seen in that election cycle. \n\nThat was seen in his wooing of both Arab and black voters in Michigan, many of whom did move to the Republican Party.\n\nHigh-ranking GOP senators were quick to offer their endorsement Monday. \n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., called Rogers a “proven conservative leader that Michigan needs in the U.S. Senate,” while Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, also supported Rogers’ run.\n\nIn his announcement, Rogers also hinted at what may be the major issues at play in 2026.\n\n“Alongside President Trump, I’ll fight to bring good, high-paying manufacturing jobs back to Michigan,” he said. \n\nA perennial issue in swing-state Michigan, the battle for the hearts and minds of the working class will likely be fierce in 2026. There are signs Rogers will have a stronger hand this time around than last year. \n\nFor example, Shawn Fain, the president of the Detroit-based United Auto Workers union, has repositioned himself as an ally of the new administration, despite having campaigned for Harris in 2024 while repeatedly calling Trump a “scab.”\n\nRogers also gave his “guarantee we’ll protect Social Security for our seniors.” \n\nThat’s intended as a preemptive response to the repeated accusations made by Washington Democrats that Republicans will raid benefits programs in order to finance tax cuts.\n\nRogers’ guarantees not to touch Social Security are reminiscent of his 2024 guarantees that he would not propose national legislation against abortion if elected as a senator. His remarks are likely meant to nip Democrats’ accusations in the bud there as well.\n\nThe only Democrat currently in the running for the party’s nomination is Mallory McMorrow, a state senator who had a high-profile Democratic National Convention speech in 2024. Rep. Haley Stevens, D-Mich., is also considering running.\n\nIn his new bid for Senate, Rogers will have time on his side. In his previous run, Rogers did not enter the race until August of 2023—meaning, he has more time to raise money and gain endorsements this time around.\n\nBut he may face competition in the Republican primary.\n\nRep. Bill Huizenga, R-Mich., posted to X in response to speculation about him running for Senate: “I will continue to talk with voters and ask them who they believe is the best candidate for Republicans to nominate and elect to serve Michigan in the U.S. Senate.”\n\nFormer Republican Michigan gubernatorial candidate Tudor Dixon has also weighed a run for Senate.","summary":"Former Rep.

'With it, the Trump administration is causing enormous damage to itself - and there can be no more disraction from this naked truth.' \n\nCarville, who became a household name after helping get Democratic President Bill Clinton elected in 1992, called on his party to seize this opportunity. \n\nAnd by seize the opportunity, he again called on Democrats to step out of the Republicans' way. \n\n'This is where the Democrats have an opening,' Carville argued. 'In February I wrote a piece calling on my party's leaders to play dead, allowing the Republicans to punch themselves out and crumble beneath their own weight.' \n\nThat didn't go as planned. \n\nCarville noted how Democrats didn't take his advice - and ended up becoming the story, linking to a piece about how Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave Republicans the votes to avoid a government shutdown. \n\n'Now, Democrats have an opportunity to allow the Republicans to edge closer to collapse as the party in full control of Washington - let's please not become the story again and get in the way,' Carville asked. \n\nThe Democratic strategist said it was likely that in the coming weeks and months, average Americans would start feeling economic pain from the tariffs that Trump implemented. \n\n'The Trump administration will not be competent enough to dig us out,' he claimed.\n\n'The path to stabilizing and strengthening the country starts when Democrats can take back the economic narrative from the Republican Party and persuade the majority of Americans to close the book on the Trump chaos,' the Louisiana Democrat argued. \n\n'This can only be done if we avoid the distractions - whether it's Mr. Trump's third-term talk or Democratic infighting on social issues - and instead focus on the economic foundations that matter to Americans most,' he added. \n\nHe laid out a strategy where Democrats needed to first and foremost focus on prices. \n\nCarville recalled how Trump won the 2024 election by claiming that he would be a better economic steward than Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, using the post-COVID pandemic inflation experienced during President Joe Biden's tenure to make that case. \n\n'Making it clear that Trump and the Republicans willingly broke this promise should be in every ad, every podcast talking point, every message we send from now until the midterms,' Carville instructed. \n\nThe Democratic strategist also recommended not talking about the stock market dropping - but instead focus on 401(ks), which most Americans have. \n\nHe argued 'the tariffs are a poison dagger for those who have saved and vested into their 401(k) their entire lives, just to see it depleted by the reckless actions of the president.'\n\nFinally he advised that the Democrats 'make the message local' - by highlighting how the tariffs are impacting people on the ground. \n\nCarville also realistically noted that the 'Democratic brand is tarnished at this given moment' and advised party members to 'take our prints off of the message as much as possible.' \n\n'If we avoid the distractions to come and stay focused on the economy, Democrats can take back the one issue that has kept Trump on a respirator all this time,' Carville said.\n\nVoters, for years, have given Trump high marks on handling the economy. \n\n'Through all the hardships to come, we bring the silver lining,' Carville said. 'And finally, we can begin again,' he said of the Democratic Party.","summary":"Longtime Democratic strategist James Carville accused President Donald Trump of one of the most 'ignorant' acts in American history with his topsy-turvy application of tariffs that came to a head last week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14610355/james-carville-donald-trump-ignorant-acts-american-history.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/14/21/97277485-0-image-m-8_1744662628086.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/09/6964105559959582263/1024x576_MP4_6964105559959582263.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-14 20:45:23","author":"Editor,Nikki Schwab","authors":["Editor","Nikki Schwab"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":311148276,"title":"¡Bukele y Trump juntos en la Casa Blanca!","text":"¡Bukele y Trump juntos en la Casa Blanca!\n\n Presidente de El Salvador Nayib Bukele se reúne con el presidente Trump en la White House.

APP is a socially conservative nonprofit advocacy group. During the last few months of President Donald Trump's presidential campaign, his administration released high-budget ads targeting transgender women in women's sports that may have helped move the needle with swing voters, with one ad famously proclaiming \"Kamala is for they/them, President Trump is for you.\" The ad focused on Harris' track record of ushering in sex change procedures for incarcerated people in California. The survey found that nearly 66% of Americans don't think the federal government should be funding gender transition procedures, including puberty blockers, hormones and surgeries. The survey did not differentiate between minors and adults.

They have to choose between 20 to 30% of the base, which supports paying for gender transitions and surgeries with tax dollars, or the swing voters, which swing voters do not want at all.\" In 2021, former President Joe Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to expand anti-discrimination protections to include sexual orientation and gender identity, including in healthcare. He also reinterpreted Title IX to ensure those same protections applied within educational settings. The administration supported state-level initiatives, such as Colorado's inclusion of transgender treatments in its essential health benefits, under the Affordable Care Act. \"I think that the more Donald Trump's been talking about it and bringing attention to it, the more people are going to the Republican side on the issue,\" Schilling said.

The high school auditorium, set to host a drama club production of The Wiz in the coming weeks, was packed, and an overflow crowd gathered in the gym. In all, about 2,000 people turned out for what was billed as a “People’s Town Hall”—a series of events Democrats have been holding across the country in districts where GOP representatives, perhaps acting on the advice of Speaker Mike Johnson, have avoided facing their constituents in person.\n“This is the major responsibility of a member of Congress, to be responsive to their constituents,” Walz, who served in the House from 2007 to 2019, told me and a few local reporters beforehand, in the ROTC classroom that was serving as our makeshift media center. “And I said, if they don’t want to do it, I’ll come out.”\nThese kinds of town halls have been a way for Democrats to highlight Republicans’ reluctance to defend Donald Trump’s destructive agenda, after a number of GOP lawmakers struggled to do so at fiery district events in February. But they have also been forums for voters to vent—especially at Democrats, who had played their own role in the hollowing out of Rust Belt cities like theirs, who had lost two out of the last three elections to a billionaire cosplaying as a populist, and who had struggled in the opening weeks of Trump’s second term to fulfill their role as a true opposition party. “Many of us here…feel left behind and blame not only the Republican Party but also Democrats,” as one resident told Walz, describing the “erosion” of industries that served as the backbone of places like Lorain and had left it a “shell of what it once was.”\nWhat I found here—and what others have sensed elsewhere—is that a movement seems to be building. The anti-Trump public, more demoralized by the opening weeks of his presidency than determined to fight, has begun showing some life. Nowhere was this clearer than in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where I watched Bernie Sanders electrify a crowd of about 3,500 in March on an early stop of his Fighting Oligarchy Tour. “People are really, really concerned about what’s going on in Washington right now,” the senator told me then. Weeks later, the face of that oligarchy, Elon Musk, would be dealt a significant blow there, after voters conclusively elected liberal Susan Crawford to the state supreme court—despite the millions of dollars the billionaire Trump ally poured into the April 1 race on behalf of the conservative candidate. The anger seemed to be turning into action, with large-scale protests erupting in back-to-back weeks against Musk and Trump in cities across the country. Finally, it appeared “the Resistance” of the first Trump era—out of sight in the opening weeks of the second—was coming out of the shadows.\nYet it looks very different this time: The indignation is generalized, trained not just on Trump, but on the creaky political system he exploited and a Democratic establishment that no longer seems capable of meeting the moment. Democrats have “signaled a resignation to the entire thing and…seem to be insufficiently clear on the risk and the threat,” as Leah Greenberg, cofounder of Indivisible, the influential progressive grassroots organization that formed in the wake of Trump’s first election, told me recently. “I think there’s just a lot of episodes over the last few months that have really soured people on whether the Democratic Party has a clear plan and a clear assessment of the danger it’s facing right now.”\nThe Resistance of 2016 was also buoyed by a sense of hope—that Democrats, “reasonable” Republicans, or maybe Robert Mueller would come to the rescue. By contrast, the protest movement against Trump’s second term is navigating a sense that we all might be helpless in the face of what's coming. “This DOGE business will get out of control,” as one sign put it at a Tesla Takedown protest I recently attended in Chicago. “It’ll get out of control and we’ll be lucky to live through it.”\nIf anybody could rally Democrats out of that dejected posture, perhaps it was “Coach Walz”—who seemed to exude the same jocularity and charisma he had at the beginning of Kamala Harris’s campaign. Part of that was, of course, owing to the venue: “Thank you for doing this in a high school,” the former teacher said. “The only other place I’m more comfortable is my living room.” But more than that, he was no longer in the middle of a run for office, and could speak more freely than he could during last fall’s high-stakes campaign.\nAs he spoke of the need for a more “positive, populist” agenda—like the one he has worked to implement in Minnesota—he acknowledged that Republican and Democratic leadership had contributed to the precarity in places like Lorain: “It was Bill Clinton who signed NAFTA,” noted Walz, who wore a United Auto Workers pin on the lapel of his navy suit. And while Democratic policies do better serve the middle and working classes, he said, his party doesn’t move fast enough or decisively enough: “I believe that when you get power, you should wield it,” Walz said. “You win elections not to bank political capital to win the next election—you win elections to burn political capital to improve lives as quickly as you can.”\nBut Democrats’ path to power has only gotten narrower in recent elections, as the national party relies on its urban centers of support and focuses its resources on a handful of swing states. Their 2024 defeat demonstrated, in stark terms, how flawed and unsustainable that strategy is: Harris lost every battleground, while Trump made gains in blue strongholds like New York, and among voting blocs that have traditionally favored Democrats. “We can’t expect to win presidential elections [when] we don’t show up places and then every four years we go to the same seven states that we were told [were] the ‘blue wall,’” Walz told the Ohio crowd. “It wasn’t a very good wall.”\nIt was refreshing to hear such a blunt assessment of the Democrats’ strategic failures—and a reminder that things weren’t always this way. Barack Obama won this state twice. In 2012, he defeated Mitt Romney in Lorain County—once a Democratic stronghold—by more than 15 points. Four years later, Hillary Clinton won it by a 10th of a percentage point. However, Trump has carried it the last two cycles: He beat Joe Biden—who campaigned as a strident “union man”—by more than two points here in 2020, and expanded his support in 2024 to nearly six points. That’s been the story of politics in Lorain, but it’s also the story of Ohio—and America more broadly—over the last decade: Blue to purple to red. Places where Democrats could win or at least compete not so long ago—Florida, Indiana, North Carolina, Iowa—have been treated by the national party as lost causes, to the chagrin of local parties. “There’s real opportunity here,” Katie Seewer, press secretary of the Ohio Democratic Party, told me. “Ohio is very much worth investing in.”\nNew Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin—a Walz ally and fellow Minnesotan—has promised to turn things around and revive Howard Dean’s 50-state strategy. “If we’re going to turn red states to purple states to blue states,” Martin told me in December, “you can’t ignore them.” It won’t be easy for them to recapture the territory they’ve ceded to Republicans. It will require the party, which still suffers from abysmal approval ratings, to build political infrastructure in places where you might find a yard sign like the one I saw on a back road a couple hours west of Lorain, that read: “Are you an American or a Democrat?” It also demands that they meaningfully address the disillusionment that has set in over places like Lorain, which a friend of mine in Cleveland described as a “Springsteen song” of a town.\nShowing up, as Walz did, may at least be a start. At the bar of the hotel I stayed at—a 1925 restoration whose reopening in 2020, after more than a decade of disrepair, was cast as part of a downtown Lorain “rebirth” that has yet to fully materialize—a local Democrat told me the town hall had been a small taste of hope amid the relentless churn of Trumpian chaos.\nBut there was still the question of what can be done more immediately, as Trump tramples over the separation of powers, lays waste to institutions, and threatens Americans’ rights and well-being. It was important to position the party for electoral resurgence. But “what is our recourse?” one questioner asked Walz, “what can we do now?”\nBut that massive burst of activism spawned a new generation of political leaders, some of whom—like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez—have been among the handful of Democratic officials who are actually rising to this historic moment. And while that mobilization didn’t completely stop Trump from wreaking havoc in his first term, it surely helped mitigate the damage—forcing elected Democrats to fight, putting pressure on public and private institutions to take stands, and giving Republicans more to fear than a primary challenge from the MAGA right.\nIndeed, the power of that backstop has been apparent in its absence: Mobilization and fierce outcry helped save the Affordable Care Act from Trump and his Republican majorities; this time, in a matter of weeks, he and his unelected billionaire ally have bypassed Congress to dismantle entire government agencies. Trump is aided by a far more loyal Republican Party now, of course—but also by the public mandate he was able to claim in the absence of tough, sustained pushback.\nThat he’s facing some now has been heartening: It’s already taken some of the shine off Musk’s political brand, and perhaps factored into Trump backing down—for now—from some of his economy-rattling tariffs. Perhaps a second Resistance can go even bigger: Seeking not only to restore normalcy and common sense, but also tackle issues places that have long been overlooked by the political establishments.\nFor now, though, there’s still “a lot of anxiety” about the future, one grandmother told me as we walked out of the Walz town hall into the cold April dusk. Would it all just come down to the public? “I guess it’s just us,” she said. “It’s scary.”","summary":"I attended Tim Walz’s town hall, Bernie Sanders’s anti-oligarchy tour, and a protest against Elon Musk.

Ro Khanna, D-Calif., contrasted his vision for America's \"new economic patriotism\" with the future of the Republican Party with Vance at the helm. Considered a 2028 presidential contender in an already crowded field, Khanna's remarks at the City Club of Cleveland seemed to frame an early rivalry between the rising political leaders from opposite ends of the ideological spectrum. While Democratic leaders, who are likely mulling their own presidential runs, have seized opportunities to contrast President Donald Trump's agenda, Khanna took aim at Trump's likely successor during remarks on Monday. \"Vance and Musk want to completely get government out of the way to usher in a new Gilded Age, so that corporate elites, particularly tech titans, can take the wheel,\" Khanna said. \"I say it's time to turn the tables.

Khanna said Trump and Vance campaigned on restoring economic prosperity to industrial American cities but have presented \"no hopeful vision, no real solutions\" for manufacturing cities in the Rust Belt like Johnstown, Pennsylvania, and Warren, Ohio. Now representing California's Silicon Valley, Khanna called for \"fusing Silicon Valley's ingenuity with Ohio's industrial might.\" CONGRESSMAN CALLS FOR ZUCKERBERG TO ANSWER ON CHINA DEALINGS Ohio GOP Chairman Alex Triantafilou responded to Khanna's remarks in a statement to Fox News Digital: \"Ro Khanna is a far-left socialist from one of the wealthiest and wokest congressional districts in America. He served as an official surrogate for both Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. This speech is nothing but another desperate plea for attention from another elitist politician wholly out-of-touch with Middle Class voters like those in Ohio.\" \"His remarks remind Americans that California extremist liberals like Ro Khanna are responsible for enabling open borders, mass illegal immigration, and the out-of-control government spending of the Biden regime. He should’ve stayed in California.\" While Khanna did attack Trump's tariffs and \"propaganda,\" Khanna was careful to target the joint \"Trump and Vance\" agenda, critique Vance individually and increasingly connect Vance to Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Khanna tied Vance to anti-democracy ideology, his \"old\" ideas for the United States and his tax breaks for Silicon Valley, which Khanna said they don't need. With the U.S. House of Representatives on recess this week, Khanna is crisscrossing the country and visiting communities tied to his potential political opponent. Khanna visited the manufacturing town of Warren, Ohio, on Sunday, which is across the state from where Vance was born and raised in Middletown. Khanna will continue his Democratic rebuttal of the future of the Republican Party at Yale Law School on Tuesday, where both Khanna and Vance are graduates. \"I'm going actually to Yale tomorrow, where JD and I both went to law school, to talk about freedom of speech because he's been lecturing Europe about freedom of speech while sitting silently while students are snatched off campus and deported without due process.\" During the Munich Security Conference in February, Vance said free speech \"is in retreat\" across Europe. On Monday, Khanna called for Americans to stand up and speak out against \"deportations without due process\" – referring to anti-Israel protesters and illegal immigrants who have been targeted by the Trump administration. Khanna and Vance have already had their fair share of sparring on social media. Earlier this year, Vance accused the California congressman of acting like a \"whiny\" child after Khanna said a former DOGE employee should apologize for racially charged social media posts. Khanna told Vance the now-resigned staffer should apologize \"for the sake of both of our kids,\" who are both of Indian dissent.

By Monday morning, President Donald Trump proved his point once more.\n\nThrough a translator, Zelenskyy told 60 Minutes Correspondent Scott Pelley: “I believe, sadly, (that) Russian narratives are prevailing in the US.”\n\n“How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians are doing, and to still believe that they are not the aggressors, that they did not start this war?” he continued. “This speaks to the enormous influence of Russia’s information policy on America, on US politics and US politicians.”\n\nReferring to Trump’s claim that Zelenskyy is a “dictator” and the now-infamous February sit-down in the Oval Office, during which Trump and Vice President JD Vance berated Zelenskyy and demanded he thank the United States for its support, Zelenskyy told Pelley through a translator: “It’s a shift in tone, a shift in reality..and I don’t want to engage in the altered reality that is being presented to me. First and foremost, we did not launch an attack [to start the war]. It seems to me that the Vice President is somehow justifying Putin’s actions.”\n\n“How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians are doing, and to still believe that they are not the aggressors?” asks Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\nWATCH ⏱️ youtu.be/odFTqgm0984?…[image or embed]— 60 Minutes (@60minutes.bsky.social) April 14, 2025 at 12:40 PM\n\nThe comments appeared to trigger Trump, who took to his Truth Social platform on Sunday night to lambast CBS for airing the interview. “They did not one, but TWO, major stories on ‘TRUMP,’ one having to do with Ukraine, which I say is a War that would never have happened if the 2020 Election had not been RIGGED, in other words, if I were President and, the other story was having to do with Greenland, casting our Country, as led by me, falsely, inaccurately, and fraudulently,” Trump wrote. “I am so honored to be suing 60 Minutes, CBS Fake News, and Paramount, over their fraudulent, beyond recognition, reporting.” (Trump is, indeed, suing the network and television show, alleging they deceptively edited an interview with former Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to make her look better; CBS has said the lawsuit is “without merit.”)\n\nTrump went on to argue that CBS “should lose their license” and urged his Federal Communications Commission Chairman, Brendan Carr, to “impose the maximum fines and punishment, which is substantial, for their unlawful and illegal behavior.” \n\n“CBS is out of control, at levels never seen before, and they should pay a big price for this,” Trump concluded. \n\nBut for all his bluster, Trump managed to prove Zelenskyy’s point less than 24 hours after the CBS interview aired. In another early morning meltdown on Monday, Trump wrote on Truth Social that the war is “Biden’s war, not mine,” adding, “President Zelenskyy and Crooked Joe Biden did an absolutely horrible job in allowing this travesty to begin.”\n\nStill, the facts remain: It was Russian President Vladimir Putin who invaded Ukraine in February 2022. Since then, Russian forces have committed war crimes and likely crimes against humanity, according to Amnesty International. One of those alleged crimes includes kidnapping and deporting Ukrainian children to Russia, for which the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for both Putin and another Russian official in March 2023. Russia’s aggression has continued, with Ukrainian civilians among the victims. Earlier this month, Russia launched a missile at a site near a Ukrainian playground, killing 19 people, including nine children. On Sunday, two Russian missiles reportedly hit the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy, killing 35 people and wounding 117 more, according to Ukrainian officials. Trump called that attack “terrible,” “a mistake,” and “a horrible thing” on Air Force One on Sunday, according to the White House Pool Report.\n\nBut by Monday, during remarks in the Oval Office alongside President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, Trump had reverted to his pro-Russia talking points, repeating the false claim that Ukraine started the war with Russia. “He’s always looking to purchase missiles,” Trump said of Zelenskyy. “Listen, when you start a war, you gotta know you can win the war. You don’t start a war against somebody that’s 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles.”\n\nTrump has fully turned on Zelenskyy: \"He's always looking to purchase missiles. Listen, when you start a war, you gotta know you can win a war. You don't start a war against somebody that's 20 times your size and then hope that people give you some missiles.\"[image or embed]— Aaron Rupar (@atrupar.com) April 14, 2025 at 11:56 AM\n\nAt another point during that meeting, Trump insulted Zelenskyy’s intelligence, stating, “The mistake was letting the war happen. If Biden were competent and if Zelensky were competent—and I don’t know that he is. We had a rough session with this guy over here,” Trump said, referring to the February Oval Office blowup. “He just kept asking for more and more.”\n\nTrump also propped up Putin while also doubling down on the Big Lie that the 2020 election was stolen. “I went four years and Putin wouldn’t even bring it up. And as soon as the election was rigged, and I wasn’t here, that war started, there was no way that war should have been allowed to happen, and Biden should have stopped it,” he said. “And and you take a look at Putin. I’m not saying anybody’s an angel, but I will tell you I went four years and it wasn’t even a question. I told him, ‘don’t do it, you’re not going to do it.'” \n\nReporter: You mentioned last night that Russia's attack on Ukraine was a mistake— what is the is mistake?

Mike Rogers is taking another crack at a Senate bid after narrowly coming up short last November.\n\nRogers announced his bid for the open Senate seat Monday morning, casting himself as an ally of President Donald Trump and the “battle-tested” candidate best positioned to win a general election in the swing state. The Daily Caller News Foundation interviewed Rogers who discussed the need for Republican unity to avoid a contested primary and focus on flipping the seat being vacated by retiring Democratic Michigan Sen. Gary Peters.\n\nRogers’ announcement was immediately followed by a joint endorsement from Senate Majority Leader John Thune and National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) chair Tim Scott. Both senators notably visited Michigan in fall 2024 to campaign for Rogers. The former congressman said Thune and Scott’s endorsement was the result of Senate GOP leadership’s decision to pick a candidate early and “ride the horse to victory.”\n\n“It shows that we as Republicans are ready to unify early to win,” Rogers told the DCNF. “This is our chance to actually win the seat.”\n\n“What you’re seeing is a coalition and kind of coalescing around a candidate,” the Senate candidate added. “A long, protracted primary is detrimental to winning in November of ’26 and I think that’s what you’re seeing happen.”\n\nThough Rogers is the only candidate to announce a bid thus far, Trump’s endorsement is expected to weigh heavily on the GOP primary. The president supported Rogers’ candidacy during his 2024 Senate run and has hinted at supporting him again.\n\n“He might be the one,” Trump reportedly said of Rogers during a meeting with Senate Republicans in February. “We’re talking to Michael and some of the others. He may be the one to run again.”\n\n“We’d be delighted to have President Trump’s endorsement,” Rogers told the DCNF. “We’ve been talking to his staff and we think we’re in good shape and would look forward to an endorsement if he’s going to do it in the state of Michigan.”\n\nRepublican strategist Chris LaCivita, who co-managed Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign, is notably serving as an advisor to Rogers’ campaign. He said following Rogers’ campaign announcement that the Michigan contest is “the number one pickup opportunity” for Senate Republicans in 2026.\n\nRogers told the DCNF he will be a strong supporter of the president’s agenda in the Senate and is looking forward to helping codify the president’s executive orders.\n\n“I’ll stand with President Trump and we will deliver on the mandate given to him by the American people,” Rogers said in a campaign video released Monday.\n\nRogers came closer than any Republican candidate in three decades to turning one of Michigan’s Senate seats red. He lost the 2024 election for the state’s other senate seat to Democratic Michigan Sen. Elissa Slotkin by 19,000 votes. Trump carried Michigan the same night, besting Democratic nominee Kamala Harris by 80,000 votes in addition to sweeping the cycle’s six other battleground states.\n\nThe NRSC regards the open Michigan seat as one of the GOP’s best opportunities to expand its 53-47 Senate majority during the 2026 midterms. The Senate Republicans’ campaign arm is expected to aggressively campaign in support of Rogers given their endorsement.\n\nThough Rogers is proud to have come within striking distance of Slotkin despite being significantly outspent, he said he is committed to performing better than he did last cycle.\n\nHe pointed to two areas that his campaign is already seeking to improve upon: starting fundraising now by getting in the race early and building out a ground game to grow enthusiasm among Republican voters.\n\n“We’re not going to find ourselves in that same position,” Rogers told the DCNF. “And candidly, people weren’t sure we could win Michigan last go round. And we showed that we can win Michigan.”\n\nHowever, Rogers acknowledged that he will need to make inroads with the voters who cast a ballot in support of Trump, but didn’t vote for down-ballot candidates. While the president outran Rogers by roughly 100,000 votes, the former congressman still argues that he performed better than other GOP Senate candidates.\n\nMichigan was one of four states carried by Trump in 2024 that also elected Democrats to the Senate on the same ballot. The other three were Arizona, Nevada and Wisconsin.\n\n“What we’re trying to do is have conversations with those voters about why Donald Trump needs help back in Washington, DC,” Rogers told the DCNF. “We’ll make sure we have a better conversation there than maybe we had last time, and part of it was we were so over-washed by Democrat cash in the beginning, it was really hard for us to get our message out.”\n\n“There’s no Democrat that has that kind of name ID,” Rogers noted. “All of those folks are going to have to spend a lot of money trying to let people know who they are — and we think that’s a huge advantage for us.”\n\nEarly analysis from the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the contest as a “toss-up” as Democrats are looking to defend Peters’ seat. Michigan state Senator Mallory McMorrow has already jumped into the primary and Democratic Michigan Rep. Haley Stevens is rumored to be announcing a bid sometime in April. Other possible Democratic candidates are likely to enter the race.\n\nRogers believes a bitter, deeply-divided Democratic field could benefit his campaign, particularly if he is able to avoid a contested primary.\n\nHe also disputed the notion that running in a midterm year with potentially high Democratic enthusiasm will hurt his election prospects.\n\n“The electorate of Michigan is tracking right in a way we haven’t seen in the state in 30 years,” Rogers told the DCNF. “Again, mainly because we’ve just been crushed here economically.”\n\n“In the last four years, under [former President Joe] Biden and Governor [Gretchen] Whitmer, Michigan alone has lost 27,000 manufacturing jobs,” Rogers told the DCNF. “That’s unsustainable. If you care about the middle class in America, we have to have this fight, and we have to have it now.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He called on Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr to impose maximum fines and punishment “for their unlawful and illegal behavior.”\n\nThe network had no immediate comment.\n\nTrump has an ongoing $20 billion lawsuit against “60 Minutes” for how it edited an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris last fall. The president claims it was edited in a way to make Harris look good, something the newscast denies. But there are ongoing reports that Trump’s lawyers and CBS’ parent company are involved in settlement talks.\n\nCarr and the FCC have launched a parallel investigation of CBS News about the same case, one of several that it has undergone that also involve ABC News, NBC, PBS, NPR and the Walt Disney Co.\n\nDespite the legal battle, “60 Minutes” has been unstinting in its coverage of Trump’s administration since he took office for a second term, particularly correspondent Scott Pelley. He traveled to Ukraine to conduct an interview with that country’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, on the site of a Russian attack where nine children were killed earlier this month.\n\nIn the interview broadcast on Sunday, Zelenskyy said he has “100%” hatred for Russian President Vladimir Putin for the invasion of Ukraine, and invited Trump to his visit his country to see what has been done.\n\nAlso Sunday, correspondent Jon Wertheim reported from Greenland on what some people in that nation are saying about Trump’s desire to take control.\n\nIn his social media message, Trump said “60 Minutes” was no longer a news show but “a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpinion| Privacy Policy|Sports|Somali Music|Somali Map \n\nAll Rights Reserved Copyright. © 1999-2025, www.hiiraan.com","summary":"President Donald Trump bitterly attacked “60 Minutes” shortly after the CBS newsmagazine broadcast stories on Ukraine and Greenland on Sunday, saying the network was out of control and should “pay a big price” for going after him.","url":"https://www.hiiraan.com/news4/2025/Apr/201131/president_trump_says_cbs_and_60_minutes_should_pay_a_big_price_for_going_after_him.aspx","image":"http://www.hiiraan.com/2025/images/Apr/2025414638802402357296807.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 19:10:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"so","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":311129270,"title":"13 potential 2028 presidential candidates for both major parties","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\n13 potential 2028 presidential candidates for both major parties \n\nA rare open primary for both parties has a large number of people considering a run for president\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nPete Buttigieg is being discussed as one of the potential frontrunners for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination\n\n(Image credit: Shannon Finney / Getty Images)\n\nDavid Faris \n\n14 April 2025\n\nSince the post-1968 reforms that opened presidential nominations to binding primaries and caucuses, there have only been four cycles that didn't feature an incumbent or former president.

He \"built his national profile opposing the Republican president during his first term,\" said Los Angeles Times. But in March Newsom caused a stir by inviting far-right operative Charlie Kirk onto his podcast, \"angering many of the liberal activists whom Newsom would need to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination in 2028,\" said The Washington Post.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\nThe New York Democrat has taken on a leading role opposing the Trump administration's policies, including barnstorming the country with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-N.Y.). Ocasio-Cortez is \"positioning herself well for a run,\" and the 35-year-old \"would bring much-needed youthful vigour to a decaying party,\" said UnHerd.\nJB Pritzker\nThe governor of Illinois since 2019, Pritzker has chosen a very different lane from Newsom, standing up for communities under fire from the Trump administration. He has distinguished himself by \"pitching his potent combination of working-class issues, sharp business sense and reputation as a good-natured brawler,\" said Bloomberg. But Pritzker, who is not subject to term limits, \"has yet to say whether he will seek a rare but not unprecedented third term as governor,\" said the Chicago Tribune.\nJosh Shapiro\nShortlisted as Kamala Harris' running mate in 2024, Pennsylvania's governor is still in his first term. Shapiro has been \"performing a balancing act in approaching the Trump administration,\" said NBC News. He has \"cemented his image as a moderate willing to work across the aisle,\" said The Philadelphia Inquirer but remains \"largely untested on the national stage.\"\n\nThe 2024 Democratic vice presidential nominee remains Minnesota's governor until 2027 and said he would \"rather fight Trump from his position as governor\" than seek the state's open U.S. Senate seat next year, said The New Yorker. That decision means that Walz may throw his hat in for the 2028 nomination. Walz \"launched a national tour of town halls in Republican House districts, traveling the country,\" said Axios, further fueling speculation about 2028.\nGretchen Whitmer\nThe two-term Michigan governor was one of the many names discussed to replace former President Joe Biden during the summer of 2024. Her double-digit reelection in a down year for Democrats in 2022 combined with her popularity in the purple state of Michigan turned her into a national figure. In terms of 2028 contenders, \"there are few politicians talked about more than\" Whitmer, said The New York Times.\nOther names\nFormer vice president and 2024 Democratic nominee Kamala Harris is \"expected to make a decision by the end of the summer\" about running for governor of California, said the Los Angeles Times, and could still run for president again. Popular Democratic governors like Jared Polis of Colorado could join the fray, as could prominent Trump critics in the Senate like Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Cory Booker (D-N.J.), whose day-long filibuster in April means that he is \"most likely going to run again,\" said The Conversation. Celebrities like businessman Mark Cuban and ESPN commentator Stephen A. Smith are also in the mix.\nA shorter list of Republicans in the shadow of J.D.

It is not clear whether this rule will apply to former UN Ambassador and 2024 GOP runner-up Nikki Haley, who at this point represents a defeated faction in the party. It is also \"not likely she would have\" President Trump's backing \"if she runs in 2028,\" said Fox News, which could cripple her chances.\nRon DeSantis\nLike Haley, the Florida governor's biggest challenge as he prepares a 2028 presidential bid is to \"win back supporters of the Republican leader whom he dared to challenge in the last election,\" said The Associated Press. DeSantis, who ended his 2024 campaign after a disappointing showing in the Iowa GOP caucus, remains popular in Florida and was reelected by nearly 20 points in 2022 in what was once a swing state.\nKristi Noem\nNoem, now the Secretary of Homeland Security, was \"floated as a potential running mate for Trump last year\" before he picked J.D. Vance and \"has since become a loyal and vocal supporter of the president, said The Hill. She seems to have survived the scandal from her memoir, in which she found herself \"under fire for killing her family's 14-month-old dog and boasting about it,\" said The New York Times.\nMarco Rubio\nRubio ran unsuccessfully for president in 2016, losing the nomination to Trump. Now, the former Florida senator is the Secretary of State in the second Trump administration and \"needs to decide how much he wants to go along with things that clearly run counter to his previous principles,\" such as siding with Russia in the Ukraine conflict, said The Washington Post.\n\nThe sitting vice president is just 40 years old and will benefit from having a \"group of younger, more populist Republicans who are vocally advocating\" for him as Trump's successor, said Semafor. No incumbent vice president in the modern period who has sought his or her party's nomination has failed to get it. Even better, \"Trump's longtime aides and allies have begun throwing their support behind Vance,\" said The Independent.\nGlenn Youngkin\nRumored as a more mainstream alternative to President Trump for the 2024 GOP nomination, Youngkin never ended up throwing his hat in the ring. Virginia's popular GOP governor is subject to the state's unusual one-term-at-a-time limit and cannot seek re-election in 2025. He is \"seen as staunchly conservative but has a broad appeal, stretching outside of the MAGA movement,\" said The Hill.\nOther names\nVance's presumed dominance of the field makes the GOP's long-list considerably shorter than those of the Democrats. But those who received support in a recent Yougov poll include the president's son Donald Trump, Jr., Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, businessman Vivek Ramaswamy, CIA Director Tulsi Gabbard, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) and Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.\n\nExplore More\n\nPete Buttigieg\nGavin Newsom\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez\nRon DeSantis\n\nKamala Harris\nDonald Trump Jr.\n\nRepublicans\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nDavid Faris\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\nDavid Faris is an associate professor of political science at Roosevelt University and the author of It's Time to Fight Dirty: How Democrats Can Build a Lasting Majority in American Politics.

Sanchez, King and Perry have tried to put a feminist spin on the flight because of its all-female crew, even though these women effectively are space-tourism passengers who won’t be piloting the ship, which is fully automated.\n\nCritics say Bezos and Sanchez made a show of publicly embracing Donald Trump’s presidency and appeasing his autocratic tendencies by enjoying a prominent place at his Jan. 20 inauguration with other tech moguls. Prominent journalists also have come after Bezos for his last-minute decision to stop his Washington Post editorial board from endorsing Kamala Harris before the Nov. 5 election and by ordering his paper’s editors and writers to move the opinion pages into a rightward direction.\n\n“Listen, it is troubling for me too,” said King, the “CBS Mornings” co-host on Friday. “There have been some questions and some decisions that (Bezos) has made that I’ve actually gone, “huh?”\n\nKing has been blasted for appearing to turn her back on her fellow journalists at the Post, some of whom have quit the paper in protest of Bezos’s actions. King’s willingness to take a seat on the rocket, a ride that could be valued in the six figures, has furthermore raised questions about her journalistic integrity and the news values of CBS News, where journalists are not supposed to take freebies.\n\nIn her interview with “CBS Mornings” colleague Vlad Duthiers, King effectively shrugged off those concerns and tried to justify the “historic” nature of the flight.\n\n“But I think in this particular case, I think this is so much bigger than one man and one company,” King said. “I’ve chosen to separate the two. It’s not a zero-sum game.”\n\n“You can do this one the one hand, and this on the other hand. And both things can be true,” she said.\n\nOthers have vehemently disagreed with such an argument, with New York Times opinion writer Jessica Grose saying this “morally vacuous space stunt should be another nail in the coffin of celebrity feminism.” Others have similarly called the flight a “PR stunt” on behalf of Bezos, Sanchez and their brands, and ripped Elle magazine for featuring Sanchez, King, Perry and the rest of the crew on a recent cover.\n\n“You cannot rebrand oligarchy as feminism, especially when the information is in our face every day,” said Internet personality and entrepreneur Blakely Neiman Thornton in an Internet takedown earlier this month of the Elle cover. He called the magazine feature “embarrassing” for everyone involved.\n\n“What’s lower than sponcon (sponsored content) for Jeff Bezos’s pet project with rockets?” Thornton continued, directing his comment at Elle magazine for its cover story on the flight. “I understand that in late-stage capitalism the ruling class is going to buy press, but you cannot rebrand your vanity as altruism. Too much has happened.”\n\nActor Olivia Munn also wasn’t buying the female-empowerment spin put out by King, Sanchez or Perry. In an interview, she told “Today” show host Jenna Bush Hager that the flight was an excessive, “gluttonous” waste of resources when many regular people in America are hurting.\n\n“I know this is probably obnoxious, but like, it’s so much money to go to space, and there’s a lot of people who can’t even afford eggs,” said “The Newsroom” actor, referring to the significant spike in egg prices over the last few months. Munn made her remarks as Trump had begun to upend the global economy and people’s retirement savings by announcing tariffs on most of America’s trading partners.\n\nWhen Bush Hager tried to find humor and relatability in the way that Perry and Sanchez talked to Elle about how they would take the “glam” on the trip — wearing makeup and eyelash extensions — Munn looked stunned and quipped: “What? They said this out loud?!”\n\n“What’s the point?” Munn asked. “Is it historic that you guys are going on a ride? I think it’s a bit gluttonous.”","summary":"During an interview ahead of the controversial flight, King admitted it was 'troubling' to be seen as part of an 'ad' for the billionaire Bezos and his fiancee.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/14/gayle-king-justify-space-flight-pr-stunt-jeff-bezos/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GayleKing1.jpeg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 17:54:01","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.236},{"id":311131462,"title":"The Latest: El Salvador’s president says he won’t release Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the US","text":"President Donald Trump ’s top advisers and Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, said Monday that they had no basis for the small Central American nation to return Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland man who was wrongly deported there last month.\n\nTrump administration officials emphasized Abrego Garcia, who was sent to a notorious gang prison in El Salvador, was a citizen of that country and the U.S. has no say in his future. And Bukele, who has been a vital partner for the Trump administration in its deportation efforts, said he does not “have the power to return him to the United States.”\n\nThe Supreme Court has called for the Trump administration to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return.\n\nHere’s the latest:\n\nUS Army to control land on Mexico border as part of base, migrants could be detained, officials say\n\nA long sliver of federal land along the U.S.-Mexico border that Trump is turning over to the Department of Defense would be controlled by the Army as part of a base, which could allow troops to detain any trespassers, including migrants, U.S. officials told The Associated Press.\n\nThe transfer of that border zone to military control — and making it part of an Army installation — is an attempt by the Trump administration to get around a federal law that prohibits U.S. troops from being used in domestic law enforcement on American soil.\n\nBut if the troops are providing security for land that’s part of an Army base, they can perform that function. However, at least one presidential powers expert said the move is likely to be challenged in the courts.\n\nThe officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details not yet made public, said the issue is still under review in the Pentagon, but even as any legal review goes on, the administration’s intent is to have troops detain migrants at the border.\n\n▶ Read more about the military at the U.S.-Mexico border\n\n— Tara Copp and Lolita C. Baldor\n\nTrump reiterates desire to expand deportation plans to include US citizens\n\nThe president has said openly that he’d also favor El Salvador taking custody of American citizens who’ve committed violent crimes, a view he repeated Monday.\n\n“We have bad ones too, and I’m all for it because we can do things with the president for less money and have great security,” Trump said during the meeting with Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador. “And we have a huge prison population.” It is unclear how lawful U.S. citizens could be deported elsewhere in the world.\n\nBefore the press entered the Oval Office, Trump said in a video posted on social media by Bukele that he wanted to send “homegrowns” to be incarcerated in El Salvador, and added that “you’ve got to build five more places,” suggesting Bukele doesn’t have enough prison capacity for all the U.S. citizens Trump would like to send there.\n\n▶ Read more about Trump’s plans to expand deportation\n\nJustice Department charges man with arson at New Mexico Tesla dealership and GOP headquarters\n\nThat’s according to court records unsealed Monday.\n\nA criminal complaint charges Jamison R. Wagner, 40, with federal arson charges in connection with the vandalism in February at a Tesla showroom in Bernalillo, New Mexico, where authorities found two Tesla Model Y vehicles ablaze as well as spray-painted graffiti messages including “Die Elon” and “Die Tesla Nazi.”\n\nElon Musk is the billionaire CEO of Tesla and close ally of President Trump who’s helped engineer a massive downsizing of the federal government and purge of employees.\n\nThe arrest is part of a federal crackdown on what Attorney General Pam Bondi has described as a wave of domestic terrorism against property carrying the logo of Musk’s electric-car company.\n\n▶ Read more about vandalism against Tesla\n\nDC mayor says budgets cuts would be needed without action by Congress\n\nThe mayor of the nation’s capital says the city is raising its stalled budget as much as possible under authority granted by federal law, but it would still need to cut more than $410 million this fiscal year without action from Congress.\n\nDC Mayor Muriel Bowser said Monday that she’d sent a letter to the House and Senate appropriations committee to notify them.\n\nThe move comes days after the House adjourned for a two-week recess without acting on a $1.1 billion hole in the city’s budget, despite directives from President Trump to address the issue.\n\n“We believed that the fix would happen, and we wouldn’t be running around planning for cuts,” Bowser said Monday at a news conference.\n\nShe said the city is raising the budget 6%, as much as possible under federal statute, but the situation remains frustrating, with no options “off the table.”\n\nSenior officials with Bowser’s office said the law changing the budget requires council approval, but not congressional. They added that the remaining cuts would likely affect all city services, including public safety.\n\nMeta faces historic antitrust trial that could force it to break off Instagram and WhatsApp\n\nA historic antitrust trial is underway Monday for Meta Platforms Inc. in a case that could force the tech giant to break off Instagram and WhatsApp, startups it bought more than a decade ago that have since grown into social media powerhouses.\n\nIn opening statements, Federal Trade Commission attorney Daniel Matheson said Meta has used a monopoly to generate enormous profits as consumer satisfaction has dropped. He said Meta was “erecting a moat” to protect its interests by buying the two startups because the company feared they were a threat to Meta’s dominance. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and other Meta witnesses will testify during the trial.\n\nThe trial will be the first big test of President Trump’s Federal Trade Commission’s ability to challenge Big Tech. The lawsuit was filed against Meta — then called Facebook — in 2020, during Trump’s first term. It claims the company bought Instagram and WhatsApp to squash competition and establish an illegal monopoly in the social media market.\n\n▶ Read more about Meta’s antitrust trial\n\nDespite a court order, the White House bars the AP from Oval Office event\n\nDespite a court order, a reporter and photographer from The Associated Press were barred from an Oval Office news conference on Monday with Trump and his counterpart from El Salvador, Nayib Bukele.\n\nLast week’s federal court decision forbidding the Trump administration from punishing the AP for refusing to rename the Gulf of Mexico was to take effect Monday. The administration is appealing the decision and arguing with the news outlet over whether it needs to change anything until those appeals are exhausted.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. circuit set a Thursday hearing on Trump’s request that any changes be delayed while case is reviewed. The AP is fighting for more access as soon as possible.\n\n▶ Read more about the dispute between the Trump administration and the AP\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen says he’ll travel to El Salvador if Abrego Garcia isn’t released by midweek\n\nThe Democratic senator from Maryland wrote to El Salvadoran diplomats to “urgently request” meeting with the country’s president, Nayib Bukele, to discuss the potential return of a former Maryland resident, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, who was deported to the Central American nation by the Trump administration.\n\nA federal judge ruled Garcia should be returned to the U.S., a decision that was unanimously upheld by the Supreme Court last week.\n\n“If Kilmar is not home by midweek — I plan to travel to El Salvador this week to check on his condition and discuss his release,” Van Hollen wrote in a letter address to El Salvador’s ambassador to Washington.\n\nEl Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele said during a Monday Oval Office meeting that he did not intend to return Kilmar to the U.S.\n\nTrump wants Congress to end daylight saving time\n\nPresident Trump on Friday urged Congress to “push hard for more Daylight at the end of a day” in his latest dig at the semiannual changing of clocks.\n\nTrump, in a post on his Truth Social media network, said it would be “Very popular and, most importantly, no more changing of the clocks, a big inconvenience and, for our government, A VERY COSTLY EVENT!!!”\n\nThe Republican president’s position calling for more daylight would push the schedule forward, keeping the country on daylight saving time. His post came a day after a Senate panel heard testimony examining whether to set one time all year instead of shifting.\n\nThere’s been growing interest in states to standardize daylight saving time in recent years.\n\n▶ Read more about daylight savings time\n\nEmboldened anti-abortion faction wants women who have abortions to face criminal charges\n\nAdvocates involved in the abortion debate are warning about the widening influence of a movement that seeks to outlaw all abortions and enforce the ban with criminal prosecution of any women who have abortions.\n\nMainstream anti-abortion groups have largely shied away from legislation that would punish women for having abortions, but abortion abolitionists believe abortion should be considered homicide and punished with the full force of the law.\n\nSo far this year, bills introduced in at least 12 states — Alabama, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas — would allow prosecutors to charge those who have abortions with homicide. In some of those states, women could be subject to the death penalty if the bills were to become law.\n\n“With the reversal of Roe v. Wade, now states can pass the most severe abortion bans, which has galvanized the anti-abortion movement as a whole, including this part of it,” said Rachel Rebouche, dean of Temple University Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia. “Certainly the fall of Roe has brought abortion abolitionists one step closer to what they want — banning abortion nationwide.”\n\n▶ Read more about the movement to charge women who have abortions\n\nAir Force Gen. Dan Caine has been sworn in as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff\n\nThat’s nearly two months after President Trump fired his predecessor.\n\nA formal White House ceremony is expected this week.\n\nCaine, a decorated F-16 fighter pilot and well-respected officer, took over the role Saturday and was at the Pentagon over the weekend after Trump signed the necessary documents to allow him to fill the job.\n\nHe’ll serve the remainder of the four-year term of Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., who was fired by Trump as part of a broader purge of military officers believed to endorse diversity and equity programs.\n\nEl Salvador’s leader shares an inside look at meeting with Trump\n\nBefore the press entered the Oval Office, Trump and Bukele chatted in a video posted on social media by the leader of El Salvador.\n\nThe U.S. president said he wanted to send “homegrowns” to be incarcerated in El Salvador, and he suggested “you’ve got to build five more places,” suggesting Bukele doesn’t have enough prison capacity for all of the U.S. citizens Trump would like to send there.\n\nTrump also praised Bukele for his team’s slickly produced video of migrants arriving in El Salvador after being deported by the U.S.\n\n“That’s what people want to see. Respect. They want to see respect,” Trump said.\n\nHe added, “you’ve got a good team. Can I use them?”\n\nBukele said “it’s like a movie, but it’s real.”\n\nFormer President Biden to make first public speech since leaving White House on Tuesday in Chicago\n\nBiden will address the national conference of Advocates, Counselors and Representatives for the Disabled.\n\nThe former president has kept a very low profile since leaving office Jan. 20 — despite Trump scoffing repeatedly at his predecessor’s mental competency.\n\nOrganizers of the conference say participants are “committed to safeguarding and strengthening Social Security for the generations to come.”\n\nTrump has pledged to shield Social Security from possible cuts, even as Democrats say it, and other federal entitlements like Medicare, could face funding trims to help offset tax reductions the administration supports.\n\nTrump says he plans to provide temporary exemptions to automakers on his tariffs\n\nAnd the president said he’s talked with Apple CEO Tim Cook, whose company could be hurt if the China tariffs become permanent.\n\n“They need a little bit of time,” Trump said of the automakers that would have to upend their supply chains to reduce their exposure to Trump’s import taxes.\n\nTrump also said he had talked to Cook and “helped” him by exempting electronics from some of his China tariffs.\n\n“I don’t want to hurt anybody but the end result is we’re going to get to the position of greatness for our country,” said Trump.\n\nThe U.S. president also theorized that China and Vietnam were meeting “to figure out: how do we screw the United States of America?”\n\nSeizing on the March consumer price index, Trump says he’s fixed inflation\n\n“We already solved inflation,” Trump told reporters gathered Monday in the Oval Office.\n\nThe U.S. president was touting the 2.4% annual inflation rate seen in the monthly consumer price report released last Thursday. Many economists are hesitant to claim a single report makes up a broader trend. Many economists and consumers worry Trump’s tariffs will cause prices to go up in ways that hurt the economy.\n\nAn earlier version of this item incorrectly said the report came out Monday instead of last Thursday.\n\nTrump suggests Iran is ‘tapping us along’\n\nThe president expressed some impatience at the pace of nuclear negotiations with Iran.\n\n“I think they’re tapping us along,” he said.\n\nThe next meeting is scheduled for this coming weekend.\n\n“These are radicalized people. And they cannot have a nuclear weapon,” Trump said.\n\nTrump is again praising his own health after undergoing an annual physical\n\nHe says the results indict “you’ve got me for a little longer.”\n\nThe president spent hours Friday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. He said after it that testing went well.\n\nA medical report on the physical was released Sunday. But Trump brought up the test again a day later, telling reporters in the Oval Office on Monday that he did well on a cognitive exam performed as part of it.\n\n“I like taking them because they’re not too tough for me to take,” Trump said of cognitive tests. He said his health was good enough that he should be around for years or at the very least “a little longer.”\n\nBondi: US would provide plane if El Salvador returns Abrego Garcia, which Bukele called ‘preposterous’\n\nTrump referred questions about Abrego Garcia to Attorney General Pam Bondi, who said he was illegally in the U.S. and that courts have ruled that Abrego Garcia was a member of the MS-13 gang.\n\n“That’s up to El Salvador if they want to return him. That’s not up to us,” Bondi said.\n\nShe called the issue “international matters” and “foreign affairs” and said the U.S. would facilitate Abrego Garcia’s return of El Salvador wanted to send him back by providing an airplane.\n\nBukele was asked if he plans to return Abrego Garcia and he asked how he could return him and said it was “preposterous.” He called Abrego Garcia “a terrorist” and that he had no power to return Abrego Garcia to the United States.\n\nIn a complaint, Abrego Garcia’s lawyers have disputed the government’s claims that he was in a gang.\n\nTrump: Man accused of setting fire to Pennsylvania governor’s mansion is ‘probably just a whack job’\n\nThe president was asked about Cody Balmer, who police say broke into the mansion, set a fire that caused significant damage and forced Gov. Josh Shapiro, his family and guests to evacuate the building during the Jewish holiday of Passover. He said, “The attacker was not a fan of Trump.”\n\nTrump’s comments came in the Oval Office as he met with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele.\n\nTrump added, “The attacker basically wasn’t a fan of anybody” and also noted, “A thing like that cannot be allowed to happen.”\n\nTrump declines to criticize Russia for the recent strike on the Ukrainian city of Sumy\n\nTrump criticized former President Joe Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy but not Russian leader Vladimir Putin.\n\n“If Biden were competent and if Zelenskyy were competent . . . that war should’ve never been allowed to happen,” Trump said in the Oval Office.\n\nReferring to Putin, Trump said “I’m not saying anybody’s an angel.”\n\nTrump has previously described the strike on Sumy as a “mistake.” On Monday, he said the mistake was allowing the war to start in the first place.\n\n“Biden could’ve stopped it and Zelenskyy could’ve stopped it and Putin should’ve never started it,” he said. “Everybody’s to blame.”\n\nTrump and Bukele discuss transgender athletes, which Bukele calls ‘violence’\n\nTrump and Bukele quickly got into a discussion about transgender athletes in the White House, with the U.S. president asking his counterpart from El Salvador, “Do you allow men to play in women’s sports?”\n\n“That’s violence,” Bukele responded.\n\nTrump said there are people in the U.S. who “fight to the death” to allow transgender athletes to play and Bukele said, “We’re big on protecting women.”\n\nThough Trump frequently speaks about transgender athletes, he said, “I don’t like talking about it because I want to save it for just before the next election.”\n\nTrump meets with Salvadoran president in the Oval Office\n\nTrump is meeting with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele in the Oval Office, telling the visiting head of state “you are helping us out” by holding migrants deported from the United States in a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nTrump said his administration’s hardline policies have restored order along the U.S.-Mexico border. He said of the changes, “We’re proud of them. Now we just need to get the criminals and murders and rapists”out of “our country.”\n\nBukele arrives at the White House\n\nTrump greeted Bukele at the White House on Monday and ignored shouted questions from reporters about Abrego Garcia.\n\nThe president shook Bukele’s hand and directed the leader of El Salvador towards waiting reporters to pose for pictures and Trump pumped his fist.\n\nThey then went inside together.\n\nTrump’s schedule for Monday\n\nThis morning, the president is meeting with the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele. After the meeting, they will have lunch together. This afternoon, at 3 p.m., Trump will meet with The Ohio State University football team, the 2025 College National Football champions.\n\nSome top tech leaders have embraced Trump. That’s created a political divide in Silicon Valley\n\nLike many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy.\n\nThe only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Trump’s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company’s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google’s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them.\n\nLast weekend was Lyons’ second, also against Trump, but it had a different feel.\n\nThe man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who wouldn’t give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley’s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several joined Trump at his inauguration.\n\nTo Lyons, the change says as much about what’s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays.\n\n“One of the things I’ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,” Lyons said.\n\n▶ Read more about Silicon Valley’s political divide\n\nUS funding cuts have halted or threatened aid programs in Syria\n\nThat includes health and nutrition services for displaced people and child protection for children in notorious camps housing the families of alleged Islamic State members.\n\nWhile funding cut from the World Food Program in Syria was restored, other cuts remain, including nearly $12 million from Save the Children and nearly $2 million from World Vision.\n\nWorld Vision Syria Response Director Emmanuel Isch said the organization has largely halted a health and nutrition program serving 30,000 to 40,000 internally displaced people, many of whom “have limited access to basic services.”\n\nSave the Children Country Director Bujar Hoxha said it has reprogrammed funding to continue case management for unaccompanied minors in the al-Hol and al-Roj camps and programs for malnourished children in different parts of Syria.\n\n“But that is for very limited timeline,” he said, noting that within a few weeks “we have to either find a way to continue funding, or we have to close it down.”\n\nTrump says ‘I just got here’ despite pledge to end Ukraine war before taking office\n\nPresident Trump issued a statement on social media over the ongoing war in Ukraine, saying he had “NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS WAR.”\n\nDespite his repeated promise as a candidate that he’d have the Russia-Ukraine war settled within 24 hours — even before taking office — he said Monday: “I just got here.”\n\n“The War between Russia and Ukraine is Biden’s war, not mine. I just got here, and for four years during my term, had no problem in preventing it from happening,” Trump said.\n\nTrump last month said he’d been “a little bit sarcastic” when he had past pledged he’d resolve the war.\n\nTop White House aide says Abrego Garcia’s fate is up to El Salvador\n\nAhead of Trump’s meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, a top White House aide signaled the U.S. president wouldn’t be asking his counterpart to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.\n\n“It’s up to El Salvador and to the government and the people of El Salvador what the fate of their own citizens is,” Stephen Miller, a deputy chief of staff, told reporters at the White House on Monday morning. “We can’t extradite citizens of foreign countries to our country over the objection of those countries.”\n\nSenator seeks meeting with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele over Abrego Garcia’s return\n\nSen. Chris Van Hollen says he plans to travel to El Salvador this week if Abrego Garcia, a constituent, isn’t returned by that time.\n\n“Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia never should have been abducted and illegally deported, and the courts have made clear: the Administration must bring him home, now,” the Maryland Democrat said in a statement.\n\nHe said that since the Trump administration “appears to be ignoring these court mandates,” more action is needed.\n\nWall Street joins a global rally after Trump exempts some electronics from tariffs\n\nStocks are rallying worldwide after President Trump relaxed some of his tariffs, for now at least.\n\nThe S&P 500 was 1.7% higher in early trading Monday. It’s coming off a chaotic week where it careened through historic swings as markets struggled to catch up with Trump’s moves on tariffs.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 434 points, or 1.1%, and the Nasdaq composite was up 2.5%. Apple, Nvidia and other big technology companies led the way on Wall Street after Trump said he was exempting smartphones, computers and some other electronics from some of his stiff tariffs.\n\n▶ Read more about the financial markets\n\nA key ally in Trump’s migrant crackdown is coming for a visit\n\nPresident Trump is hosting Nayib Bukele, the president of El Salvador, at the White House on Monday as the small Central American nation becomes a critical lynchpin of the U.S. administration’s mass deportation operation.\n\nSince March, El Salvador has accepted from the U.S. more than 200 Venezuelan immigrants — whom Trump administration officials have accused of gang activity and violent crimes — and placed them inside the country’s notorious maximum-security gang prison just outside of the capital, San Salvador. It’s also holding a Maryland man who the administration admits was wrongly deported but has not been returned to the U.S., despite court orders to do so.\n\nThat has made Bukele, who remains extremely popular in El Salvador due in part to the crackdown on the country’s powerful street gangs, a vital ally for the Trump administration, which has offered little evidence for its claims that the Venezuelan immigrants were in fact gang members, nor has it released names of those deported.\n\n▶ Read more about El Salvador President Nayib Bukele\n\nWhite House responds to China on rare earths\n\nKevin Hassett, a top economic adviser to President Trump, said China’s decision to stop exports of some rare earth minerals was “concerning.”\n\nRare earths are critical ingredients for technology and electronic manufacturing.\n\n“The rare earth limits are being studied very carefully, and they’re concerning, and we’re thinking about all the options right now,” Hassett told reporters outside the White House.\n\nHe spoke to Fox Business earlier in the morning, where he said the administration was “100% not” expecting a recession as Trump disrupts global trade with his tariff plans.\n\nTrump says CBS and ’60 Minutes’ should ‘pay a big price’ for going after him\n\nTrump bitterly attacked “60 Minutes” shortly after the CBS news magazine broadcast stories on Ukraine and Greenland on Sunday, saying the network was out of control and should “pay a big price” for going after him.\n\n“Almost every week, 60 Minutes … mentions the name ‘TRUMP’ in a derogatory and defamatory way, but this Weekend’s ‘BROADCAST’ tops them all,” the president said on his Truth Social platform. He called on Federal Communications Commission Chairman Brendan Carr to impose maximum fines and punishment “for their unlawful and illegal behavior.”\n\nThe network had no immediate comment.\n\nTrump has an ongoing $20 billion lawsuit against “60 Minutes” for how it edited an interview with Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris last fall. The president claims it was edited in a way to make Harris look good, something the newscast denies.

Luckily, everyone inside was in a separate part of the property and managed to safely evacuate. \n\nBut the incident could have taken a deadly turn if Balmer had come across the Democratic Party governor during his bloodthirsty rampage. \n\nAccording to the police affidavit seen by DailyMail.com, Balmer told police he 'would have beaten him with a hammer' if they had crossed paths. \n\n'During his interview, Balmer admitted to harboring hatred towards Governor Shapiro,' the affidavit reads - though it's unclear whether this is on political or other grounds. \n\nBalmer launched his attack on the mansion, located at 2035 North Front Street, after managing to scale a seven-foot fence protecting the property. \n\nShapiro was sleeping inside, alongside his wife Lori Shapiro. 'Additional guests and staff members' were also in bed at the time, according to police. \n\nCops said video surveillance footage from security cameras both inside and outside the residence showed Balmer 'climbing over an exterior perimeter fence' before smashing his way inside using a hammer. \n\n'The defendant approached the piano room windows on the south side of the Governor's Resident and proceeded to break an exterior window,' the affidavit reads. \n\n'The defendant then threw an incendiary device into the residence through the broken window'. \n\nBalmer went on to break an adjacent window and entered the burning building via this cavity, before 'deploying an incendiary device in the dining room'. \n\nPolice said he wore all-black apart from two different colored gloves - one orange and one yellow - which were later found in trash cans on nearby Peffer Street.\n\nHe also donned a 'Snap-On jacket with distinctive shoulder patches', which Pennsylvania State Police later found in his home in Penbrook Borough along with a gasoline container. \n\nThe affidavit reveals that Balmer's ex-girlfriend, who is not named, turned him in initially on his request, before he turned up at the police station himself. \n\nBalmer, from Harrisburg, told cops he removed gasoline from a lawnmower and poured it into Heineken bottles, which he used to fire-bomb the mansion. \n\nPhotographs show the luxury mansion was badly damaged by the fire, with several rooms reduced to blackened husks with all possessions inside torched to the ground. \n\nSurviving pieces of furniture in the impacted areas included a chandelier, a badly-charred sofa, and several coffee tables in the once-stunning interior.\n\nA shocking photograph of Balmer clutching a gun and pointing it down the lens of his camera has also been unearthed since.\n\nBalmer's social media profile is littered with political commentary and criticism about American institutions.\n\nHe previously made chilling posts about former president Joe Biden and his supporters, going as far as suggesting the former president was going to be killed.\n\n'Biden supporters shouldn't exist,' he wrote in one post dated January 2021.\n\n'RIP Joe Biden... whoops that's in May. #notmypresident,' another read, while another added that 'knowing is half the battle... the other half is extreme violence.'\n\nShapiro shared a statement via X about the shocking incident. \n\n'Last night at about 2am, my family and I woke up to bangs on the door from the Pennsylvania State Police after an arsonist set fire to the Governor’s Residence in Harrisburg,' he wrote on Sunday.\n\n'The Harrisburg Bureau of Fire was on the scene and while they worked to put out the fire, we were evacuated from the Residence safely by Pennsylvania State Police and assisted by Capitol Police.\n\n'Thank God no one was injured and the fire was extinguished. Every day, we stand with the law enforcement and first responders who run towards danger to protect our communities. \n\n'Last night, they did so for our family – and Lori and I are eternally grateful to them for keeping us safe.'\n\nShapiro and his wife share four children together - Sophia, Jonah, Max and Reuben.\n\nSophie and Jonah are legal adults, while Max and Reuben are minors. It is unclear if the two eldest were in the home at the time of the blaze.\n\nJust before the fire started, Shapiro, who is Jewish, offered Passover wishes on X, saying: 'From the Shapiro family’s Seder table to yours, happy Passover and Chag Pesach Sameach!'\n\nThe 29,000 square-foot mansion was built in 1968 and has served as the residence to eight governors and their families prior to Shapiro.\n\nThe property has flooded several times in the past, including during Hurricane Agnes in 1972 when then-Governor Milton Shapp resided there with his wife Muriel.\n\nIt then underwent 'extensive repairs' before flooding again in 2011 during Tropical Storm Lee.\n\nShapiro has served as the Governor of Pennsylvania since 2023. He previously worked as the attorney general for the Keystone State from 2017-2023.\n\nHe is viewed as a possible contender for the 2028 presidential race, after being eyed as a potential running mate for Kamala Harris in the previous election.","summary":"Cody Balmer, 38, has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated arson, burglary, and terrorism over the shocking incident early on Sunday morning.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14609147/josh-shapiro-arsonist-cody-balmer-revelation-fire-governor-mansion-pennsylvania.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/04/14/16/97267579-0-image-a-43_1744643195098.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/04/13/8144384836926880125/1024x576_MP4_8144384836926880125.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-14 17:41:31","author":"Editor,Laura Parnaby","authors":["Editor","Laura Parnaby"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.363},{"id":311114884,"title":"What Bernie and AOC Have Figured Out","text":"Liberals are fed up. Although people on the left tend to blame President Donald Trump and Elon Musk for America’s downward spiral, plenty of even lifelong blue voters are frustrated with a Democratic Party they see as complacent. This much was clear from Saturday’s “Fighting Oligarchy” rally in downtown Los Angeles, where an estimated 36,000 people joined Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York in attacking apathy—even, or especially, if that meant targeting timid Democrats.\n\n“This isn’t just about the Republican attacks on working people, L.A.; we need a Democratic Party that fights harder for us too,” Ocasio-Cortez told the crowd. “I want you to look at every level of office around and support Democrats who actually fight, because those are the ones who can actually defeat Republicans.”\n\nSanders and AOC are on the very long list of liberal politicians who are mad as hell, but on the very short list of those who aren’t going to take it anymore. A year and a half before the midterm elections, the pair is crisscrossing the country, trying to channel their rage into productive populism; they were in Utah yesterday and are scheduled to swing through Idaho, Montana, and Northern California this week.\n\nIn many ways, the Fighting Oligarchy tour is a continuation of Sanders’s first presidential campaign. He’s positioning himself not as one of the chosen few inside the Beltway but as one of many Americans rising up against creeping authoritarianism. For Sanders and AOC, that means fighting back against Trump and Musk, and recognizing that many prominent Democrats are upholding the very system that enabled Trump’s rise to power. The duo is offering voters a place to gather, scream, and feel a little less helpless, if only for a day.\n\nSaturday’s rally was Sanders’s largest ever, according to a spokesperson—bigger even than his presidential-campaign events in 2016 and 2020. If one primary emotion predominated, it was anger, something usually missing from former Vice President Kamala Harris’s failed run against Trump last fall. Harris lives about half an hour away from the rally site, with her husband, Doug Emhoff, in affluent Brentwood. Reportedly, she’s considering a run for California governor, but on Saturday, she was nowhere in sight. Equally absent was any trace of the party’s most recent leader, former President Joe Biden, save for a rejoinder to the anti-Biden meme “Let’s Go Brandon”—a slogan on a T-shirt that read FOXTROT DELTA TANGO, code for “Fuck Donald Trump.”\n\nIf you followed the trail of floppy sun hats making their way down the hill from Walt Disney Concert Hall toward Grand Park, where the rally was held, you’d pass anti-fascism banners, Gen Zers hawking Communist newspapers, pro-Palestinian protesters, pro-Cuban activists, and various calls to revolutionary action through tinny megaphones. You could buy black-and-white screen-printed shirts with the words RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINE surrounding Sanders’s face. Hasan Piker, the Twitch streamer whom many pundits have floated as the left’s answer to Joe Rogan, was among the influencers inside the park posting selfies and amplifying the event to his followers. (An entire “New Media” section had been designated for content creators.) The day had an anti-consultant ethos: nothing slick, nothing polished, not to mention nothing subtle. Near the metal detectors, several activists erected a giant photo illustration of Trump in a Klan hood with a Hitler mustache beneath block text reading MEIN TRUMPF.\n\nSanders, now 83, has been haranguing the 1 percent for years—Bill-ion-AIRES!—but his rhetoric has never been more resonant. Although the Fighting Oligarchy road show has the trappings of a presidential campaign, Saturday’s production was something closer to a music festival. Maggie Rogers, one of Sanders’s opening acts, called the L.A. event “Berniechella.” (Later that day, Sanders would make a surprise appearance at the actual Coachella festival a few hours away.) Another warm-up act, Joan Baez, quipped that Sanders’s gathering had “a much more meaningful goal than we had at Woodstock.” The musical headliner, Neil Young, blew his harmonica, strummed distorted riffs on electric guitar, and, as he played an extended rendition of his hit “Rockin’ in the Free World,” led the crowd in chants of “Take America back!” The afternoon sought to channel 1960s activism—Sanders spoke of attending Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech—and the musical nostalgia was, at times, heavy-handed. But instead of looking back on some imagined golden age, the theme of the day was about fighting for America’s small-d democratic future, and beating back autocracy. All of this, mind you, with fun.\n\n“We’re gonna make our revolution with joy,” Sanders proclaimed.\n\nThe Harris campaign had tried a similar strategy against Trump, bringing out Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, and other celebrities (including Rogers as well) at rallies. But those events were glossier, more sanitized. Last summer and fall, I watched Harris campaign in North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona, and Pennsylvania, and none of those gatherings had the electricity of the Fighting Oligarchy tour. Sanders, more than any of his allies in the Democratic Party, has figured out an authentic populism—maybe because he’s delivered the same message for so many decades. As he took the stage, a gospel choir sang “Power to the People.” After a “Ber-nie!” chant broke out, he was quick to correct the audience: “Not ‘Bernie,’ it is YOU!”\n\nCountless 2024 postmortems have argued that Democrats lost voters to Trumpism because they’ve become the party of elites that has lost touch with regular Americans who feel they have little stake in the system. Perhaps Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, connects with grassroots supporters because they trust that he really believes what he’s saying; his talking points do not come from a focus group. But he’s also, more simply, one of the few leaders who is filling the void of opposition. “Your presence here today is making Donald Trump and Elon Musk very nervous,” Sanders told the crowd. He scoffed at the image of the three wealthiest Americans—Musk, Jeff Bezos, and Mark Zuckerberg—assembled behind the president at his January inauguration. Those three tech titans, Sanders reminded everyone, have more wealth than the bottom half of society, some 170 million people, combined.\n\n“When we talk about oligarchy, it is not just economics. I trust that all of you know that you are living under a corrupt campaign-finance system, which allows billionaires to buy elections,” Sanders said. “Don’t tell me about democracy when Musk himself can put $270 million to elect Donald Trump and then get rewarded with the most important position in government. But it’s not just Musk and Republicans; it’s the Democratic Party as well. Their billionaires tell candidates, ‘Don’t stand up to the powerful special interests,’ and too many Democrats are listening to them.”\n\nSanders would be 87 in 2028—almost certainly too old to run for president a third time. Many view Ocasio-Cortez, 35, as the natural heir to his movement. Before she was elected to Congress, she worked on Sanders’s first presidential campaign. Now serving as his partner on the Fighting Oligarchy tour, AOC has her own cult following: As she spoke, a hush fell over the crowd. One attendee wore a homemade replica of Ocasio-Cortez’s infamous Met Gala gown with the phrase TAX THE RICH affixed to the back. Like Sanders, the congresswoman leaned heavily into populism. “It will always be the people, the masses, who refuse to comply with authoritarian regimes, who are the last and strongest defense of our country and our freedom,” she said. And, like Sanders, she lambasted the role of money in politics. She called Trump the “logical, inevitable conclusion of an American political system dominated by corporate and dark money,” and spoke of the shock she felt upon entering Congress and learning how beholden her peers were to special interests. “This movement is not about partisan labels or purity tests,” she said. “But it’s about class solidarity.”\n\nIn my conversations with attendees throughout the day, I asked people to articulate the principal emotion they’ve felt throughout 2025. “Shock,” said Rochelle Dawes, a 47-year-old educator who had just moved to California from Illinois. “Frustration,” said 62-year-old Scott Logan, “that there’s no reins being put on Trump within the government, within the Senate and the House—that’s my problem.” Logan’s wife, Bonnie McFarline, said elected officials are not doing their job. “They’re cowards,” she said flatly. Sasha Treadup, a 37-year-old from San Diego who was dressed in a Statue of Liberty costume, told me that she had come to the event, and participated in the recent “Hands Off!” day of protests, to combat her own feelings of resignation. She became fed up with the Democratic Party after Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer supported a Republican plan to avert a government shutdown. “I’m going to vote third party this time,” Treadup told me. “I feel like the two-party system just doesn’t represent my values anymore. It hasn’t for a long time.”\n\nDemocrats all over the country will be forced to contend with the reality that millions of working Americans whom they once regarded as their natural base have lost faith in the party. Sanders may be nearing the end of his career, but Ocasio-Cortez appears to be entering her prime. Many on the left are already hoping that she runs for president or, at the very least, stages a challenge to Schumer for his Senate seat. What Sanders and AOC are addressing is that people want a vehicle for their anger—something Trump and RFK Jr. effectively exploited in the last cycle. Above all, they want leaders who speak bluntly. “Donald Trump is a criminal,” Ocasio-Cortez said.","summary":"For the American left’s favorite double act, unvarnished populism is the key to rallying the resistance.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/04/bernie-sanders-aoc-rally/682430/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/d0wS5Tt1gaCx1C3wS_IpvQBVc6M=/0x105:2697x1510/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/04/2025_04_14_bernie_az_3/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 17:16:00","author":"John Hendrickson","authors":["John Hendrickson"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":311115690,"title":"90 Day Fiance: What is Mark Bessette’s net worth?","text":"Mark Bessette debuted his storyline this season on 90 Day Fiance.\n\nThe reality TV newbie introduced himself to viewers in Season 11 of the flagship series alongside his fiancee, Mina Bessette.\n\nAs he shared during his solo confessionals, Mark, 59, makes a living in aviation.\n\nThe father of three shared he works as a pilot, flying privately owned jets for clients.\n\nMark has flown high-profile passengers in his lifetime, including some celebrities and athletes.\n\nHe’s also flown Presidents George H.W.

That’s created a political divide in Silicon Valley","text":"By NICHOLAS RICCARDI\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) — Like many in the tech industry, Jeremy Lyons used to think of himself as a relatively apolitical guy.\n\nThe only time he had participated in a demonstration before now was in the opening days of Donald Trump’s first presidential term, when he joined fellow Google workers walking out of the company’s Silicon Valley campus to protest immigration restrictions. Google’s co-founder and its chief executive officer joined them.\n\nLast weekend was Lyons’ second, also against Trump, but it had a very different feel.\n\nThe man directing thousands of marchers with a bullhorn in downtown San Jose on April 5 was another tech worker who would not give his full name for fear of being identified by Trump backers. Marchers were urged not to harass drivers of Tesla vehicles, which have gone from a symbol of Silicon Valley’s environmental futurism to a pro-Trump icon. And no tech executives were anywhere to be seen, only months after several had joined Trump at his January inauguration.\n\nTo Lyons, 54, the change says as much about what’s happened to Silicon Valley over the past quarter-century as it does about the atmosphere of fear surrounding many Trump critics nowadays.\n\n“One of the things I’ve seen over that time is a shift from a nerdy utopia to a money first, move fast and break things,” Lyons said.\n\nPolitical gap seen between tech leaders and their workforce\n\nThe tech industry’s political allegiances remain divided. But as some in the upper echelons of Silicon Valley began shifting to the right politically, many of the tech industry’s everyday workers have remained liberal — but also increasingly nervous and disillusioned. Their mood is in stark contrast to the prominent tech leaders who have embraced a conservative populist ideology.\n\n“I think you’re seeing a real gap between the leadership elite here in Silicon Valley and their workforce,” said Ann Skeet, senior director of leadership ethics at an ethics institute at Santa Clara University and a longtime observer of the industry.\n\n“The shift hasn’t been for a lot of people,” said Lenny Siegel, a former mayor of Mountain View and longtime liberal activist in the valley. “It’s a handful of people who’ve gotten the attention.”\n\nThe biggest example of that is Elon Musk, the world’s richest person and CEO of the world’s best-known electric car company who has taken on a prominent role slashing federal agencies in Trump’s administration. Musk has been joined by several tech billionaires, including investor David Sacks, who helped fundraise for Trump’s campaign and became the White House’s artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency czar, and venture capitalist Marc Andreesen. Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg also attended Trump’s inauguration in Washington.\n\nZuckerberg began praising Trump after the then-candidate, angered over money Zuckerberg steered toward local election offices in some states in 2020 during the coronavirus pandemic, threatened last summer to imprison him. Zuckerberg also donated $1 million to the president’s inauguration fund and co-hosted an inauguration reception for billionaire Republican donors.\n\nTrump has filled a number of his administration’s posts with billionaires and his support from wealthy tech leaders led Democratic President Joe Biden to warn that the United States risked becoming an oligarchy ruled by elites. During Trump’s first term, the valley and its leaders were a bulwark of resistance to the Republican, especially over immigration, given that the industry draws its workforce from around the globe.\n\nIt’s against that backdrop that thousands of people attended the recent rally at a downtown San Jose park to protest the actions of Trump and Musk.\n\nEven as tech industry has changed, Silicon Valley has leaned Democratic\n\nSanta Clara County, which comprises most of Silicon Valley, swung 8 percentage points toward Trump in November election against Democrat Kamala Harris, matching the shift across California.

He has accused the network of spreading politically biased misinformation in its coverage of the Ukraine conflict and Washington’s push to acquire Greenland.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump lashed out at the broadcaster after it aired an interview with Ukraine’s Vladimir Zelensky and a segment revisiting the US president’s controversial idea to purchase Greenland.\n\nIn the Zelensky interview, the network suggested that Trump had sought to exclude Kiev from peace talks with Russia and that he “rewrote history, saying, falsely, that Ukraine had started the war and calling… Zelensky ‘a dictator without elections.’”\n\nThe US president’s “dictator” comment in February was referring to the fact that Zelensky’s presidential term expired last year and that he has refused to call a new vote, citing martial law. Trump has since softened his rhetoric about the Ukrainian leader.\n\nThe CBS report on Greenland focused on the island’s residents’ purported reluctance to become part of the US.\n\n“Almost every week, 60 Minutes… mentions the name ‘TRUMP’ in a derogatory and defamatory way, but this Weekend’s ‘BROADCAST’ tops them all,” Trump wrote.\n\n“They did not one, but TWO, major stories on ‘TRUMP,’ one having to do with Ukraine, which I say is a War that would never have happened if the 2020 Election had not been RIGGED… and, the other story was having to do with Greenland, casting our Country, as led by me, falsely, inaccurately, and fraudulently,” he added.\n\n“They are not a ‘News Show,’ but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing,” Trump suggested. “They should lose their license!”\n\nThe US leader stressed that CBS “should pay a big price” for being “out of control,” recalling his previous stand-off with the network over a heavily edited interview with Kamala Harris, his main Democratic rival prior to the November election.\n\nThe controversy over the Harris interview erupted in October when CBS aired two versions of an interview with the then-vice president. In one, she gave a long and convoluted answer about the Middle East conflict, but in the other, she gave a much clearer and more concise answer.\n\nTrump subsequently lodged a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS, calling the interview “word salad” and accusing the network of “deceitful, deceptive manipulation of news” and favoritism to the Democratic Party. CBS has admitted to editing the interview but rejected allegations that it attempted to doctor it.","summary":"The TV network “should lose its license” for overtly pushing biased narratives according to US President Donald Trump \nRead Full Article at RT.com","url":"https://www.rt.com/news/615754-trump-cbs-license-zelensky/","image":"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2025.04/article/67fd38c2203027644f132bdf.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 16:38:34","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.498},{"id":311087930,"title":"Trump calls for legal action, loss of license for CBS over ’60 Minutes’","text":"President Donald Trump was apparently watching TV on Sunday night and was not pleased with what he saw.\n\nThe evening’s programming was so distasteful he proclaimed CBS should lose their broadcasting license, and added that he hopes “the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), as headed by its Highly Respected Chairman, Brendan Carr, will impose the maximum fines and punishment, which is substantial, for their unlawful and illegal behavior.”\n\nHe added: “CBS is out of control, at levels never seen before, and they should pay a big price for this.”\n\nTrump’s fury stems from some of the subjects touched on by the network’s long-running weekend news magazine, “60 Minutes,” during their latest episode.\n\nAccording to the president, the program mentions him “almost every week” and always “in a derogatory and defamatory way,” but he added they went way too far this time.\n\n“They did not one, but TWO, major stories on ‘TRUMP’,” the president said via his Truth Social media platform (emphasis his), before calling for legal action against the nearly 100-year-old network.\n\nThe first offending segment features interviews with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and discusses the sudden change in the United States’ position on the ongoing war started by Russia. While former President Joe Biden spent much of the second half of his term spearheading an effort to see Ukraine armed and defended, the Trump Administration has attempted to solicit mineral agreements in return for aid and threatened to withhold further aid while negotiating for an end to the war with Russia.\n\nThe CBS story includes clips from an Oval Office meeting between Trump, U.S. Vice President JD Vance, and Zelenskyy, during which Trump and Vance tangled with Zelenskyy.\n\nTrump has maintained, both throughout his reelection campaign and after taking office, that Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine had he won the election in 2020. Trump continues to claim that the election was rigged against him. In calling for legal action against CBS, the president made those unsubstantiated claims again.\n\nThe war in Ukraine, Trump wrote, “is a War that would never have happened if the 2020 Election had not been RIGGED, in other words, if I were President.”\n\nDuring his interview with “60 Minutes,” Zelenskyy made a direct appeal to Trump to visit Ukraine and see the situation on the ground as a demonstration of Putin’s aggression and Ukraine’s fight for survival. If Trump were to do that, the Ukrainian president said, he would see that Russia would not keep to any negotiated peace.\n\n“Before any kind of decision, any kind of format of negotiations, come to see: people, civilians, memorials, hospitals, churches, children — destroyed or dead,” Zelenskyy said. “Come, look, and then let’s move with a plan how to finish the war. You will understand with whom you have a deal. You will understand what Putin did.”\n\nThe second story concerned Trump’s push for the U.S. to somehow acquire Greenland as a matter of national security.\n\nReporters at “60 Minutes” spoke to several Greenlanders about the president’s stance, and the piece included several experts who said Greenland is already entirely open to the U.S. military’s longstanding presence there.\n\nAccording to Trump, the framing of the “60 Minutes” story is “casting our Country, as led by me, falsely, inaccurately, and fraudulently.” He didn’t say how, but experts say Arctic dominance is fast becoming a major issue as China and Russia look to control the region as the ice melts.\n\nThis isn’t the first time Trump has taken aim at “60 Minutes.”\n\nThe show’s October interview of former Vice President Kamala Harris is the subject of a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Trump in November over allegations the network was attempting to interfere with the election by editing Harris’ response.\n\n“I am so honored to be suing 60 Minutes, CBS Fake News, and Paramount, over their fraudulent, beyond recognition, reporting. They did everything possible to illegally elect Kamala, including completely and corruptly changing major answers to Interview questions, but it just didn’t work for them. They are not a ‘News Show,’ but a dishonest Political Operative simply disguised as ‘News,’ and must be responsible for what they have done, and are doing,” Trump wrote.","summary":"President Donald Trump was apparently watching TV on Sunday night and was not pleased with what he saw.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/04/14/trump-calls-for-legal-action-loss-of-license-for-cbs-over-60-minutes/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP25101820568830.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 16:15:06","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.118},{"id":311070370,"title":"Donald Trump has a meltdown on social media after watching CBS: What is it about 60 Minutes that has angered the president?","text":"US President Donald Trump went on his social media site Truth Social on Sunday night in an angry rant against CBS and its parent company, Paramount, after viewing the latest episode of '60 Minutes'.

In their discussion, Pelley highlighted that Trump had promised to end the war in Ukraine “immediately”, before even taking office, which did not happen, reported HuffPost.

Meanwhile, Mahoning County Sheriff Jerry Greene has agreed to house as many as 100 people brought in by ICE officers to his jail in Youngstown.\n\nLast month, Zuchowski signed an agreement to work with ICE on enforcing federal immigration laws. Portage joins Seneca and Butler as the only other counties in the state to reach those contracts, ICE records show. The department posted about it on its Facebook page last week.\n\n“Although Portage County may not be a border community, the impacts of crime do not stop at border towns and, in many ways, impact communities throughout our county,” the post said. “As an office, we have encountered illegal immigrants during the course of our daily responsibilities.”\n\nGreene said he works with ICE to boost his bottom line and to help the Mahoning Valley. He said he reached out to federal officials the day after Trump won the election, saying that he believed ICE would need help.\n\n“It is financially beneficial for our department, and I believe in this,” Greene told cleveland.com and The Plain Dealer. “People who are here illegally shouldn’t be here.”\n\nGreene’s jail can hold as many as 100 ICE detainees a day. He receives $125 a day per detainee, per the contract.\n\n“People have said, ‘Oh my God, why are you doing this?’ This helps us as an agency and as a community,” Greene said.\n\nZuchowski, a Republican, tipped his hand regarding his position on undocumented immigrants during the presidential campaign between Donald Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris, after she replaced Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee.\n\nIn a Facebook post last September that has since been deleted, Zuchowski wrote; “When people ask me what’s gonna happen when the Flip-Flopping Laughing Hyena Wins?? I say write down all the addresses of the people who had her signs in their yards! Sooo when the illegal human ‘Locust’ (which she supports!) Need places to live. We’ll already have the addresses of their New families who supported their arrival!”\n\nZuchowski later elaborated on his comments in an interview with Fox News, saying, “We need to remember where these signs were because when there’s nowhere else to put these people (illegal immigrants), I look at it as a welcome mat.”\n\nHarris, of course, lost to Trump, who has followed up on his campaign promises of mass deportations.\n\nDenise Smith, the chairwoman of the Portage County Democratic Party, criticized Zuchowski’s efforts, saying that it appears that he has “a preconceived judgment about people who don’t look like everyone else.”\n\n“Bias. That’s a very good word for it,” said Smith, who served as the county’s chief assistant prosecutor before retiring in 2018. “There isn’t an immigration problem in Portage County. \n\n“I don’t think it is the proper thing to do for an elected official who is supposed to work for the people. What is the saying these days? ‘Move fast and break things.’ That’s not how to get things done.”\n\nAt the beginning of the year, the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio sent a letter to all sheriff’s departments in the state that urged them to avoid participating in partnerships with ICE. The agency cited concerns with the local agencies’ ability to carry out procedures in a constitutional manner and to afford the means to do so, said ACLU Ohio spokeswoman Sheila Smith.\n\nLast week, the department posted about the need for the effort.\n\n“In support of President Trump’s efforts to make America safe, and due to Sheriff Zuchowski’s partnership with the Southern Border Patrol Committee, PCSO has begun the process of obtaining a federal contract with ICE under” a section of the Immigration and Nationality Act, according to a recent sheriff’s department Facebook post.\n\nThe section of the act allows ICE to delegate authority to state and local law enforcement officers “to perform specified immigration officer functions under the agency’s direction and oversight,” according to ice.gov, the federal agency’s website.\n\nLocal officers can also “enforce limited immigration authority while performing routine police duties, such as identifying an alien at a DUI checkpoint and sharing information directly with ICE,” according to ice.gov. \n\nDeputies can “also exercise limited immigration authority as active participants on ICE-led task forces,” ice.gov states.\n\nGreene’s department contracts with ICE’s jail duties. Other counties with similar contracts are Williams and Seneca in Northwest Ohio and Geauga, according to records and published reports.","summary":"Two Northeast Ohio sheriff’s departments have signed new contracts with federal officials to enforce immigration laws and house detainees, authorities say.","url":"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2025/04/portage-mahoning-counties-sign-new-contracts-with-ice-for-local-immigration-enforcement.html","image":"https://www.cleveland.com/resizer/v2/CQ5VH67QQJHRXBXOJ6TIVPJFF4.jpg?auth=4c4f3cf2940f6427b7db538740508713fc3501dfe612dab7be26bd7c69977ae0&width=1280&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 16:09:55","author":"Peter Krouse","authors":["Peter Krouse"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.316},{"id":311074882,"title":"The Simpsons' most eerie predictions that have actually come true","text":"The Simpsons' most eerie predictions that have actually come true\n\nThe long-running animated show from US has an eerie knack for predictions\n\nREAD MORE: Was viral sensation 'Hawk Tuah' girl predicted by The Simpsons?\n\nBy ELLEN COUGHLAN FOR MAILONLINE\n\nPublished: 16:55 BST, 14 April 2025 | Updated: 16:56 BST, 14 April 2025\n\nFrom Donald Trump becoming president to Disney buying Fox and AI robots ruling our lives, The Simpsons has made several uncanny predictions over the years. \n\nThe beloved cartoon, which is the longest-running animated series in history, has now garnered a reputation for clairvoyance after its seemingly eerie ability to look into the future.\n\nMost skeptical fans of the show believe the claim is just a wild theory - but the show's bizarre predictions speak for themselves. \n\nThroughout 35 seasons of the animation, many moments have almost manifested themselves into real life. \n\nThe iconic series has forecast major world events, from the Ebola breakout, to the discovery of a three-eyed mutant fish, to the erection of London skyscraper The Shard. \n\nElsewhere, five years before it happened The Simpsons, prophesized Lady GaGa's Superbowl performance, even showing her suspended above the stage like her actual performance. \n\nMeanwhile a 2014 episode saw Sir Richard Branson relaxing in space, only to fast forward to 2021, where we see the businessman, 74, launch himself into the final frontier. \n\nLet's take a look at some of the most elusively spot-on predictions from The Simpsons that have come true over the years... \n\nApple Vision EIGHT\n\nThe Simpsons, with its uncanny ability to predict future events, showed scenes of virtual reality headsets taking over society in 2016 - eight years before Apple Vision was released\n\nThe Simpsons predicted the revolutionary $3,500 Apple Vision EIGHT years before fans flocked to buy newest tech gadget.\n\nThe company officially launched the Vision Pro in-store last year, and fans posted videos of them using the new tech in everyday life.\n\nAnd nine years ago, the cartoon showed scenes similar to what people were posting online - of virtual reality headsets taking over society.\n\nIn the 2016 episode titled 'Friends and Family', Mr Burns hires Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie to play his virtual reality family, which eventually becomes a technology everyone has access to.\n\nA montage shows all The Simpsons characters wearing the tech as they walk into lamp posts and fall into potholes.\n\nPrincipal Seymour Skinner has a virtual picnic and Homer and Marge lay side-by-side in bed as they virtually kiss each other.\n\nIn the 2016 episode titled 'Friends and Family', Mr Burns hires Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie to play his virtual reality family, which eventually becomes a technology everyone has access to \n\nIn London, video showed a man in a suit wearing the headset and walking his robotic dog on the street\n\nSince Apple released their Vision Pro, the experience of using the device has been compared to a Black Mirror episode.\n\nIn one video shared on social media a person was seen sitting on a New York City subway car and typing in the air as they donned the headset.\n\nElsewhere, footage from London saw a man in a suit wearing the headset and walking his robotic dog on the street. \n\nCypress Hill performing with the London Symphony Orchestra\n\nIt was back in 1996 when an episode of The Simpsons featured a joke where Cypress Hill believed they had mistakenly booked the London Symphony Orchestra whilst under the influence.\n\nFast forward to July 2024, and that joke becomes a reality at the Royal Albert Hall, where fans watched the California collective play songs from their 90s album Black Sunday and other hits alongside the LSO.\n\nCypress Hill said: 'We are thrilled to be performing with the London Symphony Orchestra in such a prestigious venue as the Royal Albert Hall.\n\n'It's a dream come true, a collaboration only The Simpsons could have predicted.' \n\nIn 1996, an episode of The Simpsons featured a joke where Cypress Hill believed they had mistakenly booked the London Symphony Orchestra whilst under the influence\n\nFast forward to July 2024, and that joke becomes a reality at the Royal Albert Hall, where fans can watch the California collective play songs from their 90s album Black Sunday\n\nDonald Trump running for U.S. presidency and 2024 campaign\n\nIn the show's 2000 episode 'Bart to the Future', Lisa Simpson becomes President of the United States.\n\nIn it, her father Homer Simpson can be seen flying past a billboard in the background, which reads: 'Trump 2024.' \n\nSixteen years later, the reality show star was elected as the 45th POTUS, making this one of the most famous predictions from the show.\n\nAnd adding to the eerie prediction - he was re-elected in November of 2024.\n\nWhen Trump was elected 16 years later after the viewing, writer Dan Greaney told the Hollywood Reporter: 'It was a warning to America.\n\n'That just seemed like the logical last stop before hitting bottom. It was pitched because it was consistent with the vision of America going insane.'\n\nAnd creator Matt Groening told The Guardian: 'We predicted that he would be president back in 2000 — but [Trump] was of course the most absurd placeholder joke name that we could think of at the time, and that's still true. It's beyond satire.'\n\nPerhaps one of the most famous predictions was in the show's 2000 episode 'Bart to the Future'\n\nKamala Harris' Inauguration outfit\n\nMeanwhile, in the same episode, The Simpsons appeared to offer a hint at Kamala Harris's vice presidency - with Lisa's choice of outfit.\n\nThe 57-year-old attended the 2021 inauguration for Joe Biden in a bright purple outfit by American designers Christopher John Rogers and Sergio Hudson, which she accessorised with a custom pearl necklace by Puerto Rican designer Wilfredo Rosado.\n\nThe ensemble bore a striking resemblance to one worn by Lisa Simpson the 2000 episode of the cartoon.\n\nBig moment: Social media users were left convinced that The Simpsons predicted Kamala Harris's vice presidency in January\n\nMatchy-matchy: VP Harris wore a purple outfit with pearls to inauguration, just like Lisa Simpson wore in a 2000 episode in which she becomes president\n\nTom Hanks at Biden's Inauguration \n\nJoe Biden's 2021 Inauguration was scaled back in the wake of concerns about the Capitol riots a few week prior - and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut the low-key event however was boosted with a TV special hosted by non other than Hollywood actor Tom Hanks, 68. \n\nDubbed Celebrating America, it saw the star speak about the 'promise of our promised land' while he introduced special guests and performances.\n\nIn a strange coincidence, 2007's The Simpson's Movie saw Tom make a cameo appearance in which he gave a similar address after the Springfield residents were quarantined under a glass dome.\n\nIn a TV advert for a new Grand Canyon, he said: 'The US government has lost its credibility, so it’s borrowing some of mine.' \n\nJoe Biden's 2021 Inauguration was scaled back in the wake of concerns about the Capitol riots a few week prior - and the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. But the low-key event however was boosted with a TV special hosted by non other than Hollywood actor Tom Hanks, 68. In a strange coincidence, 2007's The Simpson's Movie saw Tom make a cameo appearance in which he gave a similar address after the Springfield residents were quarantined under a glass dome\n\nCapitol Riots \n\nSimilarly, the long-running programme may have also predicted the US Capitol Riots which occurred in January 2021, when a mob of Donald Trump supporters caused chaos as they sought to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential elections. \n\nEerily, In the Treehouse of Horror XXXI episode, Homer sleeps through election day and doesn't get to place his vote. \n\nHe later awakes to complete and utter chaos and mayhem on the streets, with the character later seen on Inauguration Day in homemade body armour sitting on the roof of his house as Springfield burns around him. \n\nSimilarly, the long-running programme may have also predicted the US Capitol Riots which occurred in January 2021, when a mob of Donald Trump supporters caused chaos as they sought to overturn his defeat in the 2020 presidential elections\n\nSimilarities: Eerily, In the Treehouse of Horror XXXI episode, Homer sleeps through election day and doesn't get to place his vote.

Homer becomes a referee at the World Cup and exposes corruption within the soccer organisation. \n\nA year after the episode aired, a real-life scandal erupted involving top FIFA officials being indicted for corruption and bribery. \n\nIn the 2014 episode, 'You Don't Have to Live Like a Referee', Homer becomes a referee at the World Cup and exposes corruption within the soccer organisation\n\nA year after the episode aired, a real-life scandal erupted involving top FIFA officials - including Alejandro Burzaco (centre) - being indicted for corruption and bribery \n\nDisney buying 20th Century Fox \n\nIn 'When You Dish Upon a Star', which was aired in 1998, a sign reading '20th Century Fox, a Division of Walt Disney Co.' appears.\n\nJust under a decade later, in 2017, Disney announced its acquisition of 21st Century Fox in a $52.4 billion deal, bringing the eerie prediction to fruition.\n\nLady Gaga's Super Bowl performance \n\nIn the 2012 episode, 'Lisa Goes Gaga', the Bad Romance singer performs a concert that involved being suspended in the air.\n\nAnd only a few years later, during the Super Bowl LI halftime show in 2017, Lady Gaga made a grand entrance: descending from the stadium roof trapeze-style while singing, mirroring her performance in the animated series.\n\nIn the 2012 episode, 'Lisa Goes Gaga', the Bad Romance singer performs a concert that involved being suspended in the air\n\nDuring the Super Bowl LI halftime show in 2017, Lady Gaga made a grand entrance: descending from the stadium roof trapeze-style while singing \n\nFaulty voting machines in the U.S. election \n\nIn the 'Treehouse of Horror XIX' episode, aired in 2008, Homer attempts to vote for Barack Obama, but the voting machine repeatedly registered his vote for John McCain.\n\nIn the 2012 United States presidential election, there were reports of ballot machines flipping votes from Obama to Mitt Romney in the state of Pennsylvania, which resulted in a machine being removed from voting booths. \n\nIn the 'Treehouse of Horror XIX' episode, aired in 2008, Homer attempts to vote for Barack Obama, but the voting machine repeatedly registers his vote for John McCain\n\nIn the 2012 United States presidential election, there were reports of ballot machines flipping votes from Obama (pictured, left) to Mitt Romney (right) in the state of Pennsylvania \n\nNobel Prize winner\n\nIn the 2010 episode 'The Simpsons', Milhouse predicts that Bengt.

The people at CBS Fake News just don’t get it!\" the president said in a separate Truth Social post. The president has accused CBS of aiding his 2024 Democratic opponent through deceptive editing one month before he and Harris faced off in the presidential election. The saga began when Harris was widely mocked for a \"word salad\" answer she gave to \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker during a preview of the interview on \"Face the Nation,\" and CBS then aired a different answer to the same question during a primetime special. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CBS News did not immediately return a request for comment. During the \"60 Minutes\" interview with Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president said Russia’s narrative around its war with Ukraine was \"prevailing\" in the U.S. and the Trump administration. Zelenskyy told correspondent Scott Pelley his thoughts after reflecting on the explosive Oval Office meeting between him, Trump and Vice President JD Vance in February. Pelley noted Zelenskyy struggled to make his points to Trump prior to that meeting, particularly after Trump accused Zelenskyy of being a \"dictator.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I believe, sadly, Russian narratives are prevailing in the U.S.,\" Zelenskyy said. \"How is it possible to witness our losses and our suffering, to understand what the Russians are doing, and to still believe that they are not the aggressors, that they did not start this war? This speaks to the enormous influence of Russia’s information policy on America, on U.S. politics and U.S. politicians.\" Fox News' Brian Flood and Lindsay Kornick contributed to this report.","summary":"President Donald Trump called out CBS News in multiple Truth Social posts on Sunday over reporting on &quot;60 Minutes,&quot; arguing the network should be punished.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/trump-lashes-out-cbs-60-minutes-says-should-pay-big-price","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/11/931/523/election-day-2024-trump-harris-nov-5_204.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-14 15:00:14","author":"Hanna Panreck","authors":["Hanna Panreck"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169},{"id":311051560,"title":"Shaq called out for being a Trump ‘ass-kisser’","text":"The most dominant player in NBA history has been called to the carpet.\n\nUFC Pay-Per-View cards have revealed several athletes’ capitulation to, or better yet, ass-kissing of President Donald Trump, who has become an ambassador for his good friend Dana White’s professional fight league.\n\nAt UFC 309, Jon Jones, the greatest mixed martial artist of all-time, bowed to Trump after stopping heavyweight great Stipe Miocic in the third round of the highly-anticipated clash, shocking fans who did not know which side of the political fence Jones stood beforehand.\n\nThis time, Shaquille O’Neal, the all-time NBA center and analyst, hugged it out with “45” at UFC 314 in Miami on Saturday, and Diesel’s fans, who took to X to vent about it, weren’t having it.\n\nTweeted one account: “One thing about these Trump outings to UFC is that there’s always usually one ass kisser that you didn’t know about ... tonight it’s Shaq ... disappointing.”\n\n“It’s rich vs poor in this day and age.
