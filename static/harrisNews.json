And it proved I was wrong. I’m in the minority in my own country.”\n\nIt’s not the first time Hamill has expressed frustration over how Trump’s reelection reflects on the state of the United States. On Nov. 6 of last year, as the White House win solidified for Trump, the “Star Wars” icon memorably wrote on X: “They say we get the leaders we deserve. Either that has just been disproven, or this is not the America we all thought we were living in.”\n\nThey say we get the leaders we deserve.Either that has just been disproven, or this is not the America we all thought we were living in.— Mark Hamill (@MarkHamill) November 6, 2024\n\nSitting with Maron on Monday’s “WTF” episode, the star of “The Long Walk” reflected on filming “Star Wars: The Last Jedi” during Trump’s first presidential run against Hillary Clinton in 2016. \n\n“It was odd because when we were doing one of the sequels was the first time Hillary was running against him, and English people on the crew would come up to me and say, like, ‘Mark, why do Americans love Donald Trump so much?’” the 73-year-old actor recalled. “And I’m going, ‘I don’t know a single person who can stomach him.’”\n\nHe admitted to at one time thinking that Trump’s showmanship made him “amusing,” but that his perception changed in 2011 amid the soon-to-be politician’s public attacks on President Barack Obama’s birthplace.\n\n“I used to think, when I was living in New York doing theater, he was amusing to me. What’s not funny about a blowhard egomaniac with zero self-awareness?” Hamill said. “He was a buffoon. But what turned me on a dime was in 2011 when he went on the birther thing, which was interesting because that was his first foray into politics and he got a great response from that. Oh, I’m appealing to the racists and the conspiracy theorists.”\n\nHamill recently made headlines for sharing that he was on the brink of leaving the United States for the United Kingdom after Trump’s reelection before his wife Marilou York convinced him it was the wrong move. She made clear that leaving would be like Trump winning.\n\n“She’s very clever,” he said at the time. “She didn’t respond right away, but a week later she said, ‘I’m surprised you would allow him to force you out of your own country.’ That son of a bitch, I thought. I’m not leaving.” \n\nListen to Hamill’s full “WTF With Marc Maron” podcast interview here.","summary":"\"I’m in the minority in my own country,\" the \"Star Wars\" icon laments\n\n\nThe post Mark Hamill Says He’s ‘Really Ashamed’ America Voted for Trump Twice, the 2nd Administration Is ‘On Us’ appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/mark-hamill-trump-ashamed-wtf-with-marc-maron/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Mark-Hamill.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-08 23:39:39","author":"Benjamin Lindsay","authors":["Benjamin Lindsay"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":358710806,"title":"Being a parent is becoming a political battleground: How young men and women are so divided on the issue","text":"Young Americans are massively divided by gender and political affiliation on the question of whether it's important have children, a new poll has found.\n\nAccording to new research by NBC News and SurveyMonkey, women aged 18 to 29 who voted for Kamala Harris last year ranked \"having children\" 12th out of 13 in their \"personal definition of success\", with young male Harris voters putting it 10th.\n\nBut young women Trump voters ranked it 6th out of 13 and young men who voted for Trump said it was their single highest priority.\n\nEnthusiasm for \"being married\" was similarly divided, with Trump-voting young men ranking it fourth and Democrat-voting young women ranking it 11th. Interestingly, both male Harris voters and female Trump voters ranked being married identically at 9th.\n\nThat poll, conducted between August 13 and September 1, was among numerous reports, surveys, and studies that indicate a growing political divide between men and women in rich economies across the world.\n\nThe gap is so stark that an analysis of global survey data by the Financial Times last year declared that Generation Z is really \"two generations, not one\".\n\nNBC's poll found that while 18-29 year olds as a whole disapproved of Trump's job performance by 64 percent to 36 percent on average, the gap among men was only six percentage points compared to 48 points for women.\n\nPolling by the Pew Research Center in 2024 likewise found that childless men aged 18 to 34 were far more likely to want children compared to women in the same age bracket, with 57 percent compared to 45 percent.\n\nAn Independent analysis of 2024 presidential exit polls further found that a modest rightward shift among U.S. men helped deliver victory for Trump, with the contrast sharpest among Latino men.\n\nA growing share of adults under 50 say they're unlikely to ever have children, citing reasons such as \"concerns about the state of the world\", \"can't afford to raise the child\", and \"just don't want to\".\n\nThe U.S. fertility rate has fallen to around 1.6 children per woman as of 2023, which is far below the 2.1 births necessary to maintain the country's current population — part of a global plunge in birth rates that has some experts worried.\n\nIt will take decades for lower birth rates to translate to shrinking populations and high rates of immigration could counteract the drop. But the trend could wreak havoc on a global economy built on the assumption of continual growth.\n\nThe Trump administration and its allies have repeatedly said they want to spark a new baby boom, with vice president J.D. Vance describing low fertility as a \"civilizational crisis\" driven by \"cat ladies\" on the \"childless left\".\n\nAs well as drastically limiting abortion rights, Republicans have mooted prioritizing infrastructure projects in areas with higher birth rates, offering new mothers a $5,000 \"baby bonus\", and promoting marriage while cracking down on \"free love\", \"pornography\", \"same-sex relations\", and birth control.\n\nNBC's poll found that the political gender gap was particularly wide on particular issues. Men's approval for Trump was 20 points higher than women's on the subject of inflation and living costs; 20 points higher on tariffs and foreign trade; and 24 points higher on immigration and deportation.\n\nAround 66 percent of women said they were \"anxious or worried about the future\" most or almost al of the time, compared to only 46 percent of men.\n\nThe country's two most popular genders were also divided on whether women still suffer from sexism in the workplace (44 percent for women versus 27 percent for men).","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/being-parent-becoming-political-battleground-232315428.html","image":"https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/TENT8J7IOEqPIvyv4JeGMw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTI0MDA7aD0xNjAwO2NmPXdlYnA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/bba2131cbb54b97f8cec9541bc15867d","video":"","publish_date":"2025-09-08 23:23:15","author":"Io Dodds","authors":["Io Dodds"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":358699604,"title":"Late-night host Kimmel weighs in on whether his anti-Trump jokes defend 'democracy'","text":"ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel addressed whether his frequent criticism of President Donald Trump could be seen as \"defending democracy\" during an interview at the Creative Arts Emmy Awards on Sunday.

Gavin Newsom secured a long-awaited win against President Trump after a federal judge in San Francisco barred soldiers from aiding in immigration arrests and other civilian law enforcement across the state.\n\nThe decision follows months of feuding between Newsom and Trump, which recently escalated after the president deployed the National Guard in Los Angeles this past June.\n\nWhile the victory for Newsom and Democrats is clear, it also raises serious questions about how he and his party approach the issues of crime, law enforcement, and public order more generally. \n\nIndeed – unless there is a policy response that acknowledges these problems directly – the ruling could ultimately cast doubt on how seriously the Governor and his political allies take these critically important issues of public concern.\n\nA new poll from AP-NORC shows that an overwhelming majority (81%) think crime is a major concern in large cities and 66% say the same nationwide. It’s apparent that Americans consider crime a top issue – and if Democrats are looking to put MAGA to rest once and for all, they must stop defining themselves purely by opposition and finally get their policies right.\n\nIn 2024, much of former Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign was run on resistance to Trump. While that approach may have energized the base and generated short-term traction, it isn’t enough to sustain a competitive presidential campaign, especially this early in the 2028 cycle.\n\nNewsom – who is widely viewed as a leading contender for his party’s nomination – must be careful not to fall into that same trap. Although his sharp rhetoric against Trump and extremist Republicans plays well in CA, it risks pigeonholing him as a candidate who opposes plans more than he offers them.\n\nIn other words, for Newsom to be viable on the national stage, he’ll need to present an aggressive agenda that effectively addresses crime, public safety, immigration, and border control without harping on his disdain for Trump.\n\nPolling also shows that nearly two-thirds (62%) of Californians think it is important for the U.S. to secure its borders and stop the flow of illegal immigration, according to a survey from Politico/Citrin Center/Possibility Lab, although many disagree with the Trump administration’s harsh approach.\n\nTaken together, it’s evident that voters want balance – they value compassion but expect order. For Democrats, ignoring that relationship is politically dangerous.\n\nBut for Newsom, it might just be the perfect moment to position himself as a candidate who can garner support from Democrats, Independents, and swing voters alike.\n\nTo do so, he’ll have to reclaim the middle ground on crime and immigration, emphasizing both fairness and enforcement. While he proposed a plan earlier this year that would make illegal immigrants ineligible to apply for the state’s Medicare program, Newsom will need to do more to demonstrate to Californians – and ultimately voters across the country – that he’s serious about border control and national security.\n\nWe’ve already seen how running solely on anti-Trump sentiment doesn’t win elections, and the left cannot afford to make that mistake a second time. Democrats have the chance to rewrite the narrative and become the party that their voters want and need – but it will require much more than flashy slogans and social media engagement.\n\nRather, it calls for common-sense policies that appeal to voters who are tired of extremes on both sides of the aisle.\n\nAnd for Newsom specifically – as both governor of California and a viable option for the Oval Office – he must now prove that he can turn a symbolic courtroom victory into practical solutions on crime, immigration, and public safety.\n\nIf he gets it right, this ruling could serve as a launchpad for presidential ambitions.\n\nIf he fails, however, it will only highlight the weaknesses that could sink his candidacy before it even begins.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"We’ve already seen how running solely on anti-Trump sentiment doesn’t win elections, and the left cannot afford to make that mistake a second time.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/09/08/can-democrats-lead-on-crime-and-immigration-by-2028/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/LDN-L-NEWSOM-IMMIG-0717-DK-03.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-08 22:36:25","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.283},{"id":358687050,"title":"Fox News Politics Newsletter: LAPD pulls Harris security after union backlash","text":"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, with the latest updates on the Trump administration, Capitol Hill and more Fox News politics content.

There are so many flashing and pulsating lights — a freewheeling Oval Office press spray here, a Truth Social stream of consciousness there — that sensory overload is a daily problem. \n\nSometimes it is easy to miss, or minimise, the red warning signs that democracy is coming under assault. Right now, though, they are glaring: as bright and unmissable as those golden trophies amassed on the mantelpiece in the Oval Office. The glitzier the West Wing gets, the more pronounced the authoritarian lurch.\n\n\"I am not a dictator,\" said Donald Trump in the Oval Office last month, a statement which is true.\n\nAuthoritarianism, however, is more broadly defined than dictatorial totalitarianism. In their 2018 book, How Democracies Die, Harvard academics Steven Levitsky and Daniel Ziblatt developed four behavioural warning signs. When a politician rejects democratic rules, \"tolerates or encourages violence\", \"denies the legitimacy of opponents\" and \"indicates a willingness to curtail the civil liberties of opponents, including the media\". By sundown on January 6, 2021, the day of the storming of the US Capitol, Trump 1.0 had ticked those boxes. Trump 2.0 has added new categories to that list.\n\nDeploying the military\n\nThis authoritarian lurch presents itself in various forms. There are shades of militaristic authoritarianism. Trump has deployed the National Guard on the streets of the nation's capital at its most visible and sacred sites, the Washington monument and Lincoln Memorial. He has dispatched US marines to Los Angeles, ostensibly to support ICE agents in carrying out mass deportations, but partly because the City of Angels is a Democrat-run municipality in a Democrat-run state. Last week, a federal judge ruled this troop deployment was \"a serious violation of the Posse Comitatus Act\", which was passed in the late 19th century to bar the use of the military for domestic law enforcement. Ultimately, the Supreme Court will decide.\n\nA military strike last week on a boat in the Caribbean Sea killing what the White House says were 11 drug traffickers from the Tren de Aragua cartel may have violated international and maritime law. The State Department has labelled the Tren de Aragua cartel a \"terrorist\" organisation, but that, under international law, does not make them lawful targets. It is also questionable whether using the US military to summarily kill alleged criminals in an extrajudicial manner complies with US law.\n\nNow Trump has turned his attention to Chicago, another Democratic city in another Democratic state. \"I love the smell of mass deportations in the morning….\" he posted on Saturday alongside what appeared to be an AI-generated meme \"Chipocalypse Now\", a play on the 1979 movie, Apocalypse Now. \"Chicago is about to find out why it's called the Department of WAR,\" he added, referring to his rebranding of the Pentagon and Defence Department over the weekend.\n\nTrump has displayed anti-democratic tendencies. Among his first acts after returning to power was to pardon or dismiss the charges of almost 1,500 people involved in the January 6 insurrection, which sought to overturn the result of the 2020 election. \n\nIn July, the president pushed for the Governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, to gerrymander congressional districts in the Lone Star state to help Republicans gain more seats in next year's midterm congressional elections (in retaliation, Democratic California is asking voters whether they want to carry out redistricting to boost representation for the Democrats).\n\nAnother case for the Supreme Court\n\nTrump's crackdown on illegal immigration has been criticised as extra-judicial and unconstitutional. ICE agents often hide their faces when carrying out arrests and have trampled on due legal process. On his first day in office, with the stroke of his presidential pen, he sought to revoke birthright citizenship to children born in the United States to undocumented immigrants — the constitutionality of which is now being determined by the Supreme Court. \n\nThe White House has defied the courts by refusing to turn back planes carrying Venezuelan migrants who were deported under the wartime Alien Enemies Act passed in 1798. Last week, a federal appeals court ruled that the invocation of this centuries-old legislation was illegal, because the United States was not at war or under invasion. Another case for the Supreme Court.\n\nThere is a vengeful streak that smacks of authoritarianism. An increasingly politicised FBI, headed by the MAGA loyalist Kash Patel, carried out a raid on the home of the former National Security Advisor John Bolton, a one-time ally but now frequent critic of the president. \n\nTrump has revoked the security detail and clearance of the former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mark Milley, who labelled him a \"wannabe dictator\". Kamala Harris, the former vice-president and his opponent in last year's election, has had her Secret Service detail withdrawn, with Trump overturning an order issued by Joe Biden to extend it beyond the normal six months after leaving office. Without citing any evidence, he has accused Barack Obama of \"treason\". Then, he posted an AI-generated video on social media purporting to show the 44th president being taken into custody.\n\nThere are signs of censorial authoritarianism. Trump said he favoured the Federal Communications Commission revoking the broadcast licenses of ABC and NBC because their news divisions produced \"97% BAD STORIES.\" From the White House press pool he banished the Associated Press, the country's leading wire agency, because it refused to describe the \"Gulf of Mexico\" as the \"Gulf of America\". He is suing Rupert Murdoch because of stories published by the Wall Street Journal detailing his one-time friendship with the late convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. \n\nHe has frozen federal research funding from some of the country's elite universities, most notably Harvard, which a federal judge last week ruled amounted to illegal retaliation for the university's refusal to adopt changes to its governance and admission policies. Presented with August jobs figures which displeased him, Trump fired the head of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, Erika McEntarfer.\n\nTrump's war on the Fed\n\nOver the economy, he is exerting more command and control. Last month he became the first president ever to sack a board member of the Federal Reserve: Lisa Cook, an African-American economist appointed by the Biden administration who Trump has accused of mortgage fraud — allegations she denies. To pursue his protectionist tariffs agenda, he has invoked legislation, namely the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, intended for use in wartime or national emergencies.\n\nThe use of emergency powers to justify dozens of actions, including the deployment of the National Guard in Washington and his tariff regime, has become a hallmark of Trump 2.0. He has invoked them far more than his predecessors. Since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981, presidents on average have declared national emergencies seven times over the course of a four-year term. Since taking office again in January, Trump has already declared nine.\n\nThe optics of his presidency display an authoritarian aesthetic. A banner draped from the Department of Labor in Washington DC features his giant image. Martial pageants and grand parades appeal to his sense of spectacle. \n\nThen there is that gilding of the White House, and the ways his family are benefiting financially from the presidency. This ranges from the sale of Trump-branded fragrances to the billions of dollars in revenue from one of his family's companies, the cryptocurrency firm World Liberty Financial (WLFI). The BBC reported last week that Trump holds WLFI tokens worth more than $3 billion, \"making crypto the most significant source of his fortune.\"\n\n'Constitutional authoritarianism'\n\nMuch of Trump's exercise of presidential power, however, fits within the rubric of what might be called \"constitutional authoritarianism.\" A lot of the executive authority he has sought to wield is constitutional. Grey areas, such as his use of wartime powers in peacetime, will be adjudicated by the Supreme Court, the constitutional referee.\n\nAs in his first administration, we are being reminded how the US system relies on norms as well as laws. It is abnormal to see emergency powers used so freely, but that is not the same as saying it is blatantly unconstitutional. \n\nStates are allowed to gerrymander their congressional districts. No law bars presidents from displaying banners featuring their portraits from federal buildings. It is just that these kinds of personalised trappings have been regarded as crass and megalomaniacal.\n\nThe much-vaunted checks and balances of the US constitution, moreover, are not so restrictive when the president's party controls both houses of Congress, which is the case right now, and the Supreme Court harbours a majority of justices with an expansionist view of executive power.\n\nThroughout history, the United States has had an imperial presidency, partly because its prerogatives were designed with its first incumbent, George Washington, in mind. Indeed, an irony of the American revolution was that the founding fathers created a presidency with more powers than the British king. It is also worth pointing out that some of the heroes of the American story, such as Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Delano Roosevelt, were accused of being dictators for pushing the bounds of the constitution, and in Lincoln's case overstepping them.\n\nTrump's norm-busting leadership style also enjoys considerable popular support. Voters saw what happened on January 6, 2021, but did not regard it as disqualifying. In the 2024 election, he became the first Republican candidate in 20 years to win the popular vote — although his share was 49.8 per cent.\n\nTrump is not an American monarch.

At the time, she pledged to work with Trump’s team in his first term.\n\n“We do not yet know to what degree LGBT rights abroad will be a priority under President-elect Trump’s administration but are ready to work with his transition team and the new administration to address important issues that impact LGBT employees of foreign affairs agencies,” she said at the time.\n\nA person with knowledge of the situation confirmed to The Daily Signal Friday that Hannan is currently at State.\n\nTrump has taken steps to prioritize merit over the culture of “diversity, equity, and inclusion” and to reframe U.S. foreign policy to stop advocating gender ideology (the idea that a man can become a woman, or vice versa, just by saying so).\n\nThe Daily Signal does not have any evidence that Hannan has acted to oppose Trump’s policies from within, but her past support for “LGBTI activists” may raise red flags. \n\n“The State Department leadership is following [President Trump’s] order and expects every employee to do the same – they are public servants implementing the president’s agenda, not their own,” a State Department spokesperson told The Daily Signal in a statement Monday. “We will continue to hold every employee to that standard.”\n\nUnder the leadership of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department has embarked on significant reforms to root out leftist ideology and prevent foreign aid funding from propping up transgender causes.

Weinstein to the position on Monday.\n\nBesides previously serving as the Hudson Institute’s president and CEO, Weinstein was also nominated by Donald Trump in 2020 to serve as the United States Ambassador to Japan and was appointed as a member of the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations by Trump in 2018.\n\n“In this role, Weinstein will serve as an independent, internal advocate for journalistic integrity and transparency, reviewing concerns raised by employees and viewers, addressing questions about news coverage, and upholding the organization’s longstanding commitment to accuracy and accountability,” Paramount stated in a Monday press release.\n\nTouting the move, Paramount President Jeff Shell said that he was looking “forward to welcoming Ken as our new Ombudsman” while suggesting that the appointment would help restore public trust in the mainstream and legacy press.\n\n“At a time when trust in media is more important than ever, this new role reinforces our commitment to truth, trust, and accountability. I’ve known him for many years and have great respect for his integrity, sound judgment, and thoughtful approach to complex issues,” Shell said. “Ken brings not only a wealth of advisory experience in media and beyond but also a calm, measured perspective that makes him exceptionally well-suited to serve as our Ombudsman.”\n\nWeinstein, who now serves as the Japan Chair at the Hudson Institute, said he was “honored” by the new role at CBS News, which he called “one of the most respected journalistic institutions in the world.” He added that he looked “forward to supporting the talented team behind its reporting and to stewarding public trust in this critical institution.”\n\nIn its press release, Paramount stated that under the newly established position, the ombudsman would review “complaints from consumers, employees and others” about CBS News coverage and determine if they require further action. If Weinstein determines a complaint warrants additional action, it will be raised to Shell and Chair of TV Media George Cheeks.\n\n“After assessing the complaint, and if they collectively determine that such outreach is necessary, Weinstein, Shell, and Cheeks will address the complaint with the President and Executive Editor of CBS News, Tom Cibrowski, who will recommend and implement any necessary action steps,” Paramount concluded. According to a Paramount spokesperson, complaints reviewed by the ombudsman will not be made public.\n\nBesides his work for the Hudson Institute, Weinstein served on the National Council for the Humanities under George W. Bush and was nominated in 2013 by Barack Obama to sit on the Broadcast Board of Governors (now the U.S. Agency for Global Media), which oversees Voice of America and Radio Free Europe.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, Weinstein was elected chairman of the BBG and was appointed to the Advisory Committee for Trade Policy and Negotiations. Trump also nominated Weinstein to serve as the ambassador to Japan in March 2020. Though his nomination was advanced out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that fall, he was never confirmed by the full Senate, as debate over Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s replacement in the Supreme Court and the November presidential election placed a stop to his confirmation.\n\nWeinstein also donated over $10,000 to the Republican National Committee last year. As Jeremy Barr of The Washington Post noted on Monday, while some of the contributions were for the GOP’s national convention, the majority of his donations were earmarked for the “Trump 47 Committee.” \n\nThe announcement of Weinstein as the CBS News ombudsman comes just days after Paramount, which officially closed on the politically fraught Skydance merger last month, implemented new rules for interviews on its Sunday news show Face the Nation following complaints from the White House.\n\nAfter CBS initially defended its decision to trim an interview with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem “for time,” which Noem claimed was “shamefully edited,” Paramount leadership effectively sided with the administration amid ongoing public pressure. The excised portion of the interview included Noem making a series of unproven allegations against migrant Kilmar Abrego Garcia.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Cheeks consulted with Cibrowski and concluded that “the network needed to take steps to ensure that a similar situation would not reoccur,” adding that the move “was endorsed by David Ellison, the chief executive of Paramount.” Going forward, all interviews on Face the Nation will be broadcast live or live-to-tape, unless there are national security or legal concerns.\n\n“CBS News' new surrender to Trump is an open invitation to Trumpers to lie on their network,” The New Republic’s Greg Sargent wrote about the new policy.\n\nAdditionally, CBS News staffers are bracing for the likelihood that Ellison will not only purchase the anti-woke, pro-Israel digital media outlet The Free Press to be part of the news division, but will also install its founder Bari Weiss in a senior news leadership position. At the same time, while Ellison seems poised to pay a premium price for Weiss’ startup, his executive team is preparing to make painful cuts to the network.\n\n“For employees already demoralized by years of cutbacks, the optics will certainly be enraging,” Status News’ Oliver Darcy observed last week. “And make no mistake: this isn’t about financial prudence. It’s about politics. Ellison is paying not for a strong business asset, but to send a signal to the anti-mainstream media crowd that CBS News is being reshaped.”\n\nMeanwhile, House Democrats are currently investigating Paramount over the merger process and whether any anti-bribery laws were violated. \n\nAhead of the president’s administration approving the $8 billion merger with Skydance, Paramount paid Trump $16 million to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, sparking allegations that the company “bribed” the president. Furthermore, the investigation is also digging into the circumstances surrounding the cancellation of vocal Trump critic Stephen Colbert’s late-night CBS show.\n\nOn top of that, Trump boasted about a “side deal” he reached with Ellison – then the head of Skydance – to air up to $20 million of pro-Trump advertisements on CBS programming once the deal was closed. Ellison, for his part, has remained mum about the matter. All the while, the president has openly praised Ellison as a “great man” who will “do the right thing” at CBS.\n\nAdditionally, Democrats are looking into the promise Skydance made to Trump’s handpicked FCC chairman Brendan Carr just days before the agency approved the merger. At the time, Skydance’s counsel told Carr that the new Paramount would install an ombudsman for two years to conduct a “comprehensive review” of “complaints of bias” at CBS News, as well as eliminate all diversity hiring processes. \n\n“As a condition of the merger, Skydance also agreed to make changes to CBS and its editorial practices that align with the Trump Administration’s political agenda, including a commitment to eliminate ‘perceived bias’ in its reporting, the hiring of an ombudsman to police the news organization’s editorial choices, and the dismantling of any initiatives aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion,” the House Democrats noted in their letter to Ellison last month.","summary":"Kenneth Weinstein was nominated by Trump to serve as ambassador to Japan in 2020.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/cbs-news-ombudsman-kenneth-weinstein-trump-appointee-b2822531.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/26/00/13-efc9df62dea54aa6b314adfc1b58df57.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Eglf1HK5-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-08 18:17:10","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.31},{"id":358642216,"title":"LAPD ends Kamala Harris security after union backlash over elite officer use: report","text":"A specialized unit with the Los Angeles Police Department is no longer providing former Vice President Kamala Harris security, according to a new report. Officers with LAPD’s Metropolitan Division, which falls under the police department’s special operations group, stepped in to provide Harris with security after President Donald Trump yanked Harris’ security detail in August, The New York Times reported. But that protection ended on Saturday following backlash from the LAPD's union, The Los Angeles Police Protective League. The union called the arrangement \"nuts,\" arguing that \"LA taxpayers should not be footing the bill for this ridiculousness.\" \"We are happy to report that the Metro officers assigned to protect the multimillionaire failed presidential candidate are back on the street fighting crime,\" the union’s board of directors said in a statement to Fox News Digital on Monday. Meanwhile, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said using LAPD resources to provide Harris with protection was never a permanent solution. \"The plan was always to provide temporary support, and I thank L.A.P.D. for protecting former V.P. Harris and always prioritizing the safety of all Angelenos,\" Bass said in a statement to The New York Times. Bass' office did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital. TRUMP REVOKES KAMALA HARRIS' SECRET SERVICE PROTECTION, SPOKESPERSON SAYS Bass previously said in a statement Wednesday that Trump’s decision to revoke Harris’ security detail amounted to an \"act of revenge\" on a political opponent, and put Harris \"in danger,\" according to The New York Times. The LAPD did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital. The Los Angeles Times also reported on Aug. 29 that the California Highway Patrol was providing security for Harris, according to law enforcement sources. California Gov. Gavin Newsom must approve such protection, per the publication. \"Our office does not comment on security arrangements,\" Izzy Gardon, a spokesperson for Newsom, said in a statement to Fox News Digital on Thursday. SECRET SERVICE CHANGES THE AGENCY HAS MADE POST-TRUMP BUTLER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT The White House confirmed to Fox News Digital that Trump pulled Harris’ security detail on Aug. 29, and noted that typically vice presidents are only offered Secret Service protection for six months after leaving office. However, former President Joe Biden signed an order before leaving office that extended Harris’ Secret Service protection by an additional year. CNN first reported that Trump signed a memo pulling Harris' Secret Service security detail. A spokesperson for Harris told Fox News Digital no reason was provided for eliminating the protection.

It’s almost as if the president with the lowest approval rating of any modern president, and the highest number of massive protests against any modern president, is simply not as popular as he constantly deludes himself into believing he is. From the New York Times: The match, between Jannik Sinner of Italy and Carlos Alcaraz of Spain, was supposed to start at 2 p.m. Eastern time. It was initially delayed 30 minutes, and then another 15, and ultimately did not start until 2:48 p.m., with hundreds of people still waiting to get through security. Mr. Trump entered the back area of the luxury suite at the center of the stadium in Flushing, Queens, at about 1:45 p.m. and spoke to several people as fans slowly filed in. There was little demonstrable cheering or booing when Mr. Trump entered the main seating area at 2:30 p.m. for the national anthem. But when he was shown on the video screens, fans unleashed a loud round of mostly boos, with some cheers mixed in. The president was on the screens only briefly as he stood and saluted. After the first set, he was shown on the screens again, and that time was met with louder, more sustained booing, as well as some cheers. Predictably, right-wing social media platforms have been ignoring the obvious boos and the dead air from when Trump first entered the seating area (reminiscent of his birthday army parade), and pretending their messiah got a yuge welcoming reception. You can expect that, even if members of the MAGA cult do acknowledge Trump got booed, they’ll say it’s because he caused the match to start 48 minutes late, not because he’s a raging white nationalist and compulsive propaganda spreader who is weaponizing the military against Black cities, taking a Gestapo approach to immigration enforcement, and continuing to wage a tariff-based trade war that has put the American consumer’s pockets on the frontline. To be fair, in a stadium with more than 20,000 people in it, there were likely plenty of Trump fanatics in attendance, so there were certainly people cheering for him, but this is a president with the intelligence of a toddler and the ego of a spoiled rich toddler, so a crowd that appears to be more full of haters than supporters is enough to have him up in the wee hours of the morning crying to his Truth Social feed about how he’s the most popular president in history and the only reason he got booed is because Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Barack Obama, Oprah and Beyoncé planted a bunch of Antifa terrorists at a tennis match. Look, I’m just saying that maybe Trump would do well to confine his visits to places where he’s guaranteed to be welcome by everyone. Neo-nazi groups appear to think he’s “the best thing that ever happened” to them. Maybe he can show up to one of their events and get love from the very fine people on all sides. (Not that a white supremacist gathering is all that distinguishable from your average Trump rally, but whatever.) If only the nationally televised sporting events were open only to his fans, congressional Republicans and his cabinet members. 20,000 screaming fans who are only there to passionately sniff his butt and occasionally watch a ball fly across a court? Well, that’s just Trump’s greatest wet dream right there. Hell, Trump probably didn’t care about the match anyway. He hears “U.S. Open” and probably thinks, “That’s how all these damn illegals got here in the first place.” Maybe stick to Mar-a-Lago golf courses, Trumpy. They probably love you there, and if they don’t, you can just kick them out. Or, whatever. Let him keep showing up where he’s not wanted, and the people will keep making America great again by reminding him he’s the most hated world leader of a generation.

Weinstein, a former CEO of the Washington, D.C.-based Hudson Institute, as the new ombudsman for CBS News on Monday, cementing CEO David Ellison’s apparent intent to have the news organization reflect more conservative ideals.\n\nParamount President Jeff Shell said in a statement that Weinstein would bring a “wealth of advisory experience” and a “calm, measured perspective” to the role. \n\n“At a time when trust in media is more important than ever, this new role reinforces our commitment to truth, trust, and accountability,” Shell said.\n\nWeinstein, who is not a journalist, will be charged with reviewing concerns from CBS News employees and viewers, addressing questions about its coverage, and maintaining its commitment to its standards. \n\nEllison, who took hold of Paramount last month after a lengthy acquisition process, promised the Federal Communications Commission an appointment of an ombudsman to help secure federal approval.\n\nWeinstein regarded CBS News as “one of the most respected journalistic institutions in the world” in a statement and said he looked forward to “stewarding” public trust in the organization.\n\nA political theorist who previously served as the Hudson Institute’s president and CEO from 2005 to 2021, Weinstein currently serves as the Japan Chair for the institute, a conservative think tank founded by physicist Herman Kahn.\n\nHe was President Donald Trump’s nominee in 2017 to serve as U.S. ambassador to Japan. The nomination, however, never made it out of the Senate and lapsed after Trump left office in 2021.\n\nWeinstein will report any findings to Shell and Paramount’s head of TV Media, George Cheeks, according to the company. Cheeks will then work with CBS News President Tom Cibrowski to address any concerns.\n\nCBS News has faced a torrent of bias accusations from conservatives over the last year, with Trump in particular waging legal warfare against the network over coverage he has deemed unfair. \n\nTrump sued CBS for $20 billion last year over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris he alleged was illegally distorted. He used the lawsuit as a springboard for complaints over its coverage of his second term, prompting Paramount’s former controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, to review Trump segments as the company sought the FCC’s approval.\n\nIt has also faced complaints over its coverage of Israel’s war in Gaza, with a “CBS Mornings” interview between anchor Tony Dokoupil and author Ta-Nehisi Coates last year (which prompted a rare public rebuke from Redstone) and a “60 Minutes” episode in January sparking concerns of one-sided coverage.\n\n“We needed more balance,” Redstone told the New York Times in an interview published after the merger was completed. “Part of me thought, maybe Trump could accomplish what I never got done.”\n\nWeinstein appears to have had his own concerns about CBS News’ coverage. In a post last year from his recently deleted X account, Weinstein wondered if the “presence of one righteous man” — Dokoupil — could “save @CBSNews from utter condemnation?”","summary":"The former Hudson Institute head is now CBS News' internal watchdog\n\n\nThe post Paramount Appoints Conservative Think Tank Ex-CEO Kenneth Weinstein as CBS News Ombudsman appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/paramount-cbs-news-ombudsman-kenneth-r-weinstein/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/CBS_News.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-08 16:22:46","author":"Corbin Bolies,Michael Brochstein","authors":["Corbin Bolies","Michael Brochstein"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":358608502,"title":"Trump celebrates West Point alumni group canceling award ceremony to honor Tom Hanks","text":"By MICHELLE L.

(Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\nAFP via Getty Images\n\n“We don’t need destructive, WOKE recipients getting our cherished American Awards,” Trump said in a post on Truth Social Monday morning, praising West Point for “smartly” cancelling Hanks’ award ceremony.\n\nTrump’s post came days after West Point’s alumni association told faculty it would no longer hold an awards ceremony bestowing Hanks with the Sylvanus Thayer Award, meant to honor non-West Point graduates who exemplify the school’s ideals of duty, honor and country.\n\nThe announcement prompted some veterans and Democratic politicians to accuse the institution of canceling the ceremony for political reasons, as Hanks has previously criticized Trump and fundraised for former President Joe Biden.\n\nMajor General Paul Eaton, who commanded training of troops during the U.S. invasion of Iraq, posted on X Monday morning: “My Alma Mater, West Point, and like America, has been hijacked by MAGA by repudiating Tom Hanks. A new low.”\n\nTrump, in his post, also attacked the Oscars and other “Fake Award Shows,” urging them to “review their Standards and Practices in the name of Fairness and Justice.”\n\nForbes has reached out to the West Point Association of Graduates for comment (The Washington Post, which first reported on the ceremony’s cancellation, said the alumni association did not respond to requests for comment, and that Hanks could not be reached).\n\nWhy Did West Point Cancel Tom Hanks’ Award Ceremony?\n\nRetired Col. Mark Bieger, president and CEO of West Point’s alumni association, said in a statement to faculty the cancellation would allow the institution to “continue its focus on its core mission of preparing cadets to lead, fight, and win as officers in the world’s most lethal force, the United States Army.” It is unclear whether Hanks’ award has been revoked entirely, or if he will be presented the award in a different format. West Point’s alumni association had announced in June that Hanks would receive the award on Sept. 25, citing the actor’s advocacy for veterans and portrayal of army troops in film. Amy McGrath, a Marines veteran and Democratic challenger to Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., in 2020, accused the academy of canceling the ceremony “because [Hanks] doesn’t align with Trump.” Trump has also wielded influence over West Point in his second term, signing an executive order in January that barred educational institutions operated by the Armed Forces from promoting “un-American” ideas, including “gender ideology” and that “America’s founding documents are racist or sexist.” West Point also rescinded a job offer to Jen Easterly, a former Biden administration cybersecurity official, in July amid complaints from Trump loyalist Laura Loomer.\n\nTrump’s criticism of award shows comes hours after “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” won its first-ever Emmy Award after 33 total nominations, taking the prize for best directing for a variety series. The victory comes months after CBS said the show would be canceled for financial reasons, though many interpreted it to be a political decision to secure federal approval for its merger with Skydance. The cancellation also followed the network’s settlement with Trump, who had sued over what he alleged was a deceptively edited “60 Minutes” interview of his election opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump had celebrated Colbert’s cancellation in a Truth Social post in July: “I absolutely love that Colbert got fired. His talent was even less than his ratings.” Colbert, already a frequent Trump critic, responded to Trump on air: “Go f— yourself.”\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nColbert could win an Emmy at this weekend’s Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony, where he is nominated for best talk series alongside Trump critics Jon Stewart, for the Daily Show, and Jimmy Kimmel, for his ABC late-night show.\n\nFurther Reading\n\n‘The Late Show With Stephen Colbert’ Wins First-Ever Emmy in Wake of Cancelation (Variety)\n\nGot a tip?

Alex Padilla, D-Calif., for a bid to be the next governor of California. \n\nThe longtime California politician is seen as a reliable and known quantity in the state’s uber-left politics at a time when Democrats face historic unpopularity. \n\n“This is an uncertain time for California, and Alex Padilla brings certainty and stability,” California lobbyist Afrack Vargas, told Politico. \n\nPadilla garnered national attention in June for disrupting a press conference by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. At the press gaggle, Padilla actively disregarded instructions from Noem’s security team. He subsequently was removed from the room where the press conference was happening and put in handcuffs. Some of his Senate colleagues were less than impressed with his behavior.\n\n“You can’t show up without your pin, refuse to announce yourself, and lunge at a Cabinet secretary. It doesn’t matter who you are,” Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., who has launched his own campaign to be a state governor, posted on X.\n\nYet the incident earned Padilla national press coverage and the solidarity of his fellow Senate Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said the footage of Padilla’s conflict with Noem’s security “sickened his stomach,” and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., noted that he was “disgusted by what I saw.” \n\nPadilla has spent decades climbing his way up the political ladder serving as a member and president of the Los Angeles City Council, a California state senator, and then California’s secretary of state until his appointment by Gov. Gavin Newsom to finish out the term of Sen. Kamala Harris after she was elected vice president in 2020. He was elected to a full term in the Senate in 2022 and therefore would not have to forfeit his Senate seat if he chose to seek the state office. The Democratic Party gubernatorial primary is on June 2, 2026\n\nThe current frontrunner in the polls is former California congresswoman Katie Porter. An ardent progressive, Porter co-chaired her former professor Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s failed 2020 presidential campaign and earned fame for taking bank CEOs to task in House hearings. She is reportedly seen by some California politicos as too left-wing a candidate even by California standards. \n\n“There’s a lot of the chattering class of Sacramento who haven’t yet been enamored with some of the other candidates,” Democrat consultant Andrew Acosta told Politico.But is Padilla even interested in succeeding Newsom as governor? Politico reports he “ducked and dodged queries” on the matter. “I love California,” he told the outlet, “I’ve had the privilege and the honor of serving in so many different capacities … I’ve tried to do my best to help improve people’s lives, so hope to continue to serve in some capacity for the foreseeable future.”","summary":"Prominent California Democrat strategists are eyeing Sen.

It was a visual guide that the agency had kept for years to explain Social Security’s many technological systems and processes. The paper was covered in flow charts, arrows and text so minuscule you almost needed a magnifying glass to read it. Dudek called it Social Security’s “Dead Sea Scroll.”\n\nDudek and a fellow Social Security Administration bureaucrat taped the scroll across a wall of a windowless executive office. This was where a team from the new Department of Government Efficiency was going to set up shop.\n\nDOGE was already terrifying the federal bureaucracy with the prospect of mass job loss and intrusions into previously sacrosanct databases. Still, Dudek and a handful of his tech-oriented colleagues were hopeful: If any agency needed a dose of efficiency, it was theirs. “There was kind of an excitement, actually,” a longtime top agency official said. “I’d spent 29 years trying to use technology and data in ways that the agency would never get around to.”\n\nThe Social Security Administration is 90 years old. Even today, thousands of its physical records are stored in former limestone mines in Missouri and Pennsylvania. Its core software dates back to the early 1980s, and only a few programmers remain who understand the intricacies of its more than 60 million lines of code. The agency has been talking about switching from paper Social Security cards to electronic ones for two decades, without making it happen.\n\nDOGE, billed as a squad of crack technologists, seemed perfectly designed to overcome such obstacles. And its young members were initially inquisitive about how Social Security worked and what most needed fixing. Several times over those first few days, Akash Bobba, a 21-year-old coder who’d been the first of them to arrive, held his face close to Dudek’s scroll, tracing connections between the agency’s venerable IT systems with his index finger. Bobba asked: “Who would know about this part of the architecture?”\n\nBefore long, though, he and the other DOGErs buried their heads in their laptops and plugged in their headphones. Their senior leaders had already written out goals on a whiteboard. At the top: Find fraud. Quickly.\n\nDudek’s scroll was forgotten. The heavy paper started to unpeel from the wall, and it eventually sagged to the floor.\n\nIt only got worse from there, said Dudek, who would — improbably — be named acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, a position he held through May. In 15 hours of interviews with ProPublica, Dudek described the chaos of working with DOGE and how he tried first to collaborate, and then to protect the agency, resulting in turns that were at various times alarming, confounding and tragicomic.\n\nDOGE, he said, began acting like “a bunch of people who didn’t know what they were doing, with ideas of how government should run — thinking it should work like a McDonald’s or a bank — screaming all the time.”\n\nThe shock troops of DOGE, at the Social Security Administration and myriad other federal agencies, were the advance guard in perhaps the most dramatic transformation of the U.S. government since the New Deal. And despite the highly public departure of DOGE’s leader, Elon Musk, that campaign continues today. Key DOGE team members have transitioned to permanent jobs at the SSA, including as the agency’s top technology officials. The 19-year-old whose self-anointed moniker — “Big Balls” — has made him one of the most memorable DOGErs joined the agency this summer.\n\nThe DOGE philosophy has been embraced by the SSA’s commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who was confirmed by the Senate in May. “Your bias has to be — because mine is — that DOGE is helping make things better,” Bisignano told senior officials weeks after replacing Dudek, according to a recording obtained by ProPublica. “It may not feel that way, but don’t believe everything you read.”\n\nIn a statement, a Social Security Administration spokesperson said that Bisignano has made “notable” initial progress and that “the initiatives underway will continue to strengthen service delivery and enhance the integrity and efficiency of our systems.” The statement asserted that “under President Trump’s leadership and his commitment to protect and preserve Social Security, Commissioner Bisignano is strengthening Social Security and the programs it provides for Americans now and in the future.”\n\nFor all the controversy DOGE has generated, its time at the Social Security Administration has not amounted to looming armageddon, as some Democrats warn. What it’s been, as much as anything, is a missed opportunity, according to interviews with more than 35 current or recently departed Social Security officials and staff, who spoke on the condition of anonymity mostly out of fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, and a review of hundreds of pages of internal documents, emails and court records.\n\nThe DOGE team, and Bisignano, have prioritized scoring quick wins that allow them to post triumphant tweets and press releases — especially, in the early months, about an essentially nonexistent form of fraud — while squandering the chance for systemic change at an agency that genuinely needs it.\n\nThey could have worked to modernize Social Security’s legacy software, the current and former staffers say. They could have tried to streamline the stupefying volume of documentation that many Social Security beneficiaries have to provide. They could have built search tools to help staff navigate the agency’s 60,000 pages of policies. (New hires often need at least three years to master the nuances of even one type of case.) They could have done something about wait times for disability claims and appeals, which often take over a year.\n\nThey did none of these things.\n\nUltimately, no one had a more complete view of the missed opportunity than Lee Dudek. A 48-year-old with a shaved pate and a broad build that suggests an aging former linebacker, Dudek is a figure seemingly native to the universe of President Donald Trump — an unlikely holder of a key post, elevated after little or no vetting, who briefly attains notoriety in Washington circles before vanishing into obscurity — not unlike Anthony Scaramucci in the first Trump administration.\n\nDudek, a midlevel bureaucrat with blunt confidence and a preference for his own ideas, had failed in his one past attempt to manage a small team within the SSA, leading him and his supervisors to conclude he shouldn’t oversee others. Despite that, Trump made him the boss of 57,500 people as acting commissioner of the agency this spring.\n\nDudek got the job, wittingly or not, through an end-run around his bosses. After Trump won the 2024 election and rumors of a cost-cutting-and-efficiency SWAT team began to swirl, Dudek asked people he knew at big tech companies for introductions to potential DOGE members. In December, a contact set him up with Musk’s right-hand man, Steve Davis, which led to conversations with other DOGE figures about how they could “hack” Social Security’s bureaucracy to “get to yes,” Dudek said.\n\nBy February, Dudek had become the conduit between DOGE and the SSA, alerting top agency officials that DOGE wanted to work at headquarters. And unlike Michelle King, the acting agency chief at the time, Dudek was willing to speed up the new-hire training process to give DOGE access to virtually all of the SSA’s databases. This precipitated a sequence of events that began with him being placed on administrative leave, where he wrote a LinkedIn post that propelled him into the public eye for the first time: “I confess,” he posted. “I helped DOGE understand SSA. … I confess. I … circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done.” The same weekend, King resigned and Dudek, who was at home in his underwear watching MSNBC, got an email stating that the president of the United States had appointed him commissioner.\n\nBetween February and May, when Dudek’s tenure ended, his erratic rhetoric and decisions routinely madefront-page news. He was often portrayed as a DOGE patsy, perhaps even a fool. But in his interviews with ProPublica this summer, he revealed himself to be a much more complex figure, a disappointed believer in DOGE’s potential, who maintains he did what he could to protect Social Security’s mission under duress.\n\nDudek is the first agency head to speak in detail on the record about what it is like to be thrust into such an important position under Trump. He told ProPublica that he decided to speak because he wishes that “those who govern” would have more frank and honest conversations with the public.\n\nTo the 73 million Americans whose financial lives depend on the viability of Social Security, those first months were a seesaw of apprehension and rumor. Inside the agency, Dudek, ill-prepared for leadership or for DOGE’s murky agenda, was stumbling through the chaos in part by creating some of his own.\n\nDudek knows what it’s like to depend on Social Security. When he was a kid in Saginaw, Michigan, his mother turned to Social Security disability benefits to support him and his siblings after she got injured at a Ford-affiliated parts factory; she also had a mental-health breakdown. (Dudek’s now-deceased father, who worked for General Motors, was alternately abusive and absent, according to the family.)\n\nAt school, Dudek was isolated and bullied for being poor, his sister told ProPublica, and he’s had an underdog’s quick temper ever since. But he was always an advanced student, and he developed an early interest in computer science and politics. As a teenager, he often watched C-Span. He was fascinated, he said, by “how government worked and how it could change people’s lives.”\n\nDudek arrived in Washington in 1995 to attend Catholic University of America. He was the type of earnest young man who was enthralled by President Bill Clinton’s campaign at the time to “reinvent government” by injecting it with private sector-style efficiency, much as Trump and DOGE later said they would.\n\nIn college, he also displayed the tendency to buck authority that would mark his professional career. He had a night job running the university’s computer labs; if there were problems, he was supposed to call his boss. He wasn’t supposed to install new software on all the computers, but that’s what he did. It worked, although he got a talking-to about knowing his role.\n\nAfter graduating, Dudek spent nearly a decade working for tech companies that contracted with the federal government on modernization projects, before migrating to several jobs within federal agencies themselves.\n\nIn 2009, he arrived at the Social Security Administration as an IT security official. The agency was just like the Saginaw he’d run from, Dudek said: an insular, hidebound place where everyone knew everyone and they all thought innovation would cost them their jobs.\n\nBut the SSA wasn’t the only institution at fault. Congress had enacted byzantine eligibility requirements for disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits, forcing the agency to expend huge amounts of time and money running those programs. At the same time, lawmakers had capped the agency’s administrative funding just as tens of millions of Baby Boomers were aging into retirement, exploding Social Security’s rolls. (The SSA is now at its lowest staffing level in a half-century, even as it has taken on 40 million more beneficiaries.)\n\nBecause of the SSA’s stultifying culture, Dudek said, he leaned into his insubordinate streak. He had the sense that he could do it better, and when he felt like his proposals weren’t receiving money or attention, he went around his superiors. In one instance, he approached potential partners at credit card companies, hoping they would like his ideas for combating fraud and would relay those ideas to the Social Security commissioner at the time. “Certainly from an internal perspective within SSA, certainly from a congressional perspective, I was violating rules,” Dudek said.\n\nIn part because of moves like this, Dudek got reassigned within the agency several times. Over the years, he was given multiple roles as a “senior adviser,” a title he said is for federal employees who are either incompetent but too established to fire or highly competent in a technical way but lacking in management or people skills.\n\nDudek was stubborn. He could come off as a know-it-all, and he tended to ramble when speaking. But he is also thoughtful and well read. In our interviews, he brought up everything from the origins of the concept of Social Security among sociologists and psychologists in the Depression era to the bureaucrats who were left behind in faraway places after the decline of the British Empire. He repeatedly cited James Q. Wilson’s seminal 1989 book, “Bureaucracy,” which spills considerable ink on the inefficiencies of the Social Security Administration — and on a businessman named Donald J. Trump who supposedly knew how to cut through red tape to get building projects done. (“No such law constrained Trump,” Wilson wrote.)\n\nDudek had been a lifelong Democrat and voted for Kamala Harris. But, like some other liberals, he was becoming exasperated with the “administrative state” and special-interest groups, including corporations, unions and social-justice organizations, that “capture” government and stifle reform. If it took Trump to cut through that, Dudek was open-minded. “The world has changed,” he scribbled in a note to himself. “We must change with it.”\n\nImmediately after Dudek became commissioner in February, he got a call from Scott Coulter, a hedge fund manager with a $12 million Manhattan apartment who’d been picked to lead DOGE’s team at Social Security. “We’re coming,” Coulter said. “Be prepared.”\n\nDOGE arrived ready to embark on a specific mission: Its operatives at the Treasury Department had seen data suggesting that the Social Security Administration wasn’t keeping its death records up to date. They thought they saw signs of fraudulent payments. Musk was very, very interested.\n\nDudek wasn’t initially concerned about this focus, which he and his colleagues viewed as misguided. To him, the young coders were nerdy outsiders just like he’d once been, albeit ones from privileged Ivy League and Silicon Valley backgrounds. They “reminded me of myself when I first got into computers,” he said. He thought he could mold them.\n\nIn particular, Dudek liked Bobba, who had a gentle air and a thick pile of dark hair that covered his forehead. Dudek had spent hours with Bobba, trying to get him to focus on concrete problems like how beneficiaries’ records were stored, often as cumbersome PDF and image files. Instead, Bobba, who did not respond to a request for comment, prioritized Musk’s quest to prove that dead people were receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nBobba had completed high school in New Jersey just three and a half years earlier. As a class speaker at his graduation, he’d encouraged his classmates not to ignore “nuance” and “complexity.” He’d lamented the “increasing willingness to simplify even the most complex narratives into sensational tidbits” like “280-character tweets,” which “perpetuates misinformation.”\n\nYet Dudek had barely settled in as commissioner when Bobba unintentionally sparked a national misinformation firestorm: A table he created appeared as a screenshot in a grossly misleading Musk tweet about “vampires” over the age of 100 allegedly collecting Social Security checks. Bobba had sorted people with a Social Security number by age and found more than 12 million over 120 years old still listed in the agency’s data.\n\nBobba said he knew these people weren’t actually receiving benefits and tried to tell Musk so, to no avail, according to SSA officials. Dudek watched in horror as Trump then shared the same statistics with both houses of Congress and a national television audience, claiming the numbers proved “shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors.” (The White House declined to comment on this episode. Bisignano, the new SSA commissioner, has repeatedlysaid that “the work that DOGE did was 100% accurate.”)\n\nInside the SSA, the DOGE team tried to find proof of the fraud that Musk and Trump had proclaimed, but it didn’t seem to know how to go about it, jumping from tactic to tactic. “It was a maelstrom of topic A to topic G to topic C to topic Q,” said a senior SSA official who was in the room. “Were we still helping anything by explaining stuff?” the official said. “It really wasn’t clear by that point.”\n\nDudek began to realize that the problem wasn’t primarily the people he called the “DOGE kids.” It was the senior leaders who were issuing orders without heeding what the young DOGErs were learning.\n\nDudek was perhaps the most favorably disposed to the outsiders. Plenty of agency officials were already put off by the DOGErs, who often issued peremptory orders to meet with them and answer questions.\n\nMichelle Kowalski, an analyst who has since departed the agency, was instructed to take one of the DOGE people, Cole Killian, through earnings data and historical records to analyze the cases of extremely old people whose deaths had not been recorded in Social Security data. She found herself having to explain to him, again and again, that many of these people were born before states reported births and deaths to the federal government and decades before the advent of electronic record keeping. In the early days of the agency, some people didn’t even know their birthdays.\n\nKowalski had assumed that Killian was middle-aged, since he was issuing instructions to her team. But he usually kept his camera turned off during video meetings. When he finally turned it on for one call, the face she saw seemed like that of a teenager.\n\nKillian was actually 24, just six years removed from performing “Hotel California” at his high school talent show at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School outside of Boston. (Killian, whose DOGE responsibilities also involved work at the Environmental Protection Agency, did not respond to a request for comment from ProPublica.)\n\nKowalski was exasperated by having to answer to such inexperience, even as so many of her colleagues were being pushed out the door by the Trump administration. She was not alone.\n\n“Many of us had actually believed in the marketed idea of genius technologists coming in to make things work better,” one senior SSA official said. But DOGE ended up being more interested, the official said, in “trying to prove that the Social Security Administration was entirely incompetent” than in suggesting improvements.\n\nEmployees at headquarters took their time walking past the glass-walled conference room where DOGE staffers had set up, glaring in at them as they worked among stacks of laptops that they used for assignments at different agencies. On a blog popular among SSA staffers, the mood in the comments section turned dark, with some anonymous posters identifying where in the building the “incel DOGE boys” were located and saying that “they are just warming up … just think what will come next.”\n\nDudek sensed the growing tension. He felt it, too. He’d been getting anonymous death threats mailed to his house. He decided to move the DOGE operatives to a more secluded area of the campus and assigned an armed security detail to protect them.\n\nDuring his first month as commissioner, Dudek ran his executive meetings in bombastic fashion, as if he were Trump on “The Apprentice.” And he sent out insulting full-staff emails pressuring career employees to retire. (Some 5,500 have left, with 1,500 more expected to follow.)\n\nDudek says this behavior stemmed partly from being in over his head, amazed by who he was suddenly answering to. “When the president of the United States asks you to do stuff,” he said, “you get caught up.”\n\nBut he also claims he was just performing a role. “Early on, I put on a persona of a yeller,” Dudek said. (Multiple longtime colleagues and friends noticed the change, they told ProPublica. As one put it, “There’s Lee, and then there’s Leland-performingly-Dudek.”)\n\nThis, he hoped, would convince the White House and DOGE of his commitment, which could in turn give him credibility as he kept trying to push them toward the real issues at Social Security.\n\nBut the Trump administration kept having other plans. Its demands usually came through Coulter, the DOGE lead with the Harvard and hedge fund background, who early on dropped by Dudek’s office unannounced multiple times a week, Dudek said.\n\n“I really think it would be helpful if you were to do this tomorrow,” Coulter would say to Dudek about eliminating an entire division of the SSA or cutting more staff, according to Dudek. To him, these suggestions felt like orders. If he responded, “I don’t know, let me think about it,” Coulter would call a few hours later on the encrypted-messaging app Signal to ask, “You really aren’t catching on, are you?” and “Do you know how many times I’ve defended you?”\n\n“I was supposed to get the message — and it would be ‘my own decision,’ so I’d be stuck with it,” Dudek said. “He can say he never told me to do anything.” (Coulter, who has been working for DOGE at NASA in recent months, did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOne of Coulter’s suggestions involved the SSA’s Office of Transformation, which had been doing the seemingly DOGE-like work of developing an online application to replace many of the agency’s paper-based forms and in-person interviews. The office had been working with elderly, low-income and disabled people to see what most confused them about SSA processes and what would most help them if these were redesigned.\n\nBut instead of facilitating this effort at greater efficiency, Coulter told Dudek to close the office, according to Dudek, claiming it was wasteful. Agency staff joked that DOGE shut it down because its name included a word that began with “trans.”\n\nDudek and his colleagues sometimes attempted to co-opt DOGE’s obsessions in the hope that they could address a genuine problem at the agency. This strategy was not successful.\n\nSuch was the case with the issue of phone fraud. Knowing that the DOGErs would perk up at the mention of anything fraud-related, Dudek and other officials made a point of explaining that they’d been working on an initiative to block bots that had been calling the agency. The bots would impersonate beneficiaries, using dates of birth and other information that can be found on the internet, to try to change the beneficiaries’ bank-routing information and steal their benefits.\n\nIn 2024, Dudek had been on a team that spearheaded an effort to combat this type of fraud. The plans included running all phone-based requests for bank account changes against a Treasury Department database of suspicious accounts and analyzing such calls to verify whether they were being made from the vicinity of the address on file of the person purportedly calling.\n\nDOGE ignored the proposed solutions. Instead, the White House instructed Dudek to end all claims and direct-deposit transactions by phone. Beneficiaries would have to verify their own identities by using an often-confusing web portal or by traveling to a field office to do it in person. For millions of elderly or disabled people, these were daunting or impossible options.\n\nWhen this policy was rolled out at the end of March, beneficiaries panicked. Many flocked to field offices to preemptively provide proof of their identities even when they didn’t need to.\n\nBack at headquarters, in a weekly staff meeting, Dudek asked who could jump on the increasingly urgent task of making it easier to schedule field office appointments via the SSA website. “Well, Lee, you just fired that team,” one official answered, referring to the Office of Transformation. (Dudek said he asked this question on purpose to make sure DOGE heard the answer.)\n\nOver the course of six weeks under Dudek, the phone policy zigged and zagged a half dozen times — for example, the SSA adopted, then abandoned, a three-day waiting period to conduct an algorithmic fraud check on all calls — before finally ending up nearly where it began. Transactions could be carried out by phone again.\n\nThroughout this saga, Dudek was still getting calls from White House officials — most often from Katie Miller, DOGE’s spokesperson and the wife of Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s closest advisers. (Katie Miller went on to work for Musk before announcing plans to launch her own podcast. She did not respond to a request for comment.) Miller often called well into the evening, Dudek said, to chastise him about anything the press had reported that day that had caught the administration off guard.\n\nAs Dudek restored the phone policy to its pre-Trump version, Miller got angrier. “You changed the president’s policy,” she said, according to Dudek.\n\n“I’m like, ‘No, I’m still with the president’s policy,’” Dudek told Miller. But, if Social Security officials could implement the anti-fraud measures that he and his team had previously been planning, he said, they could “achieve the same end.” In that case, Dudek said, “we will do so and ease the friction point on the public.”\n\n“How dare you,” Miller said.\n\nIncreasingly dismayed, Dudek hatched a plan that seemed to embody his mix of good intentions, hubris and melodrama. He decided he would continue to play along with DOGE on the surface, in part so that Coulter and the other bigwigs would think he was still handling their business and thus spend less time at the agency. The younger DOGE team members, he said, were “easier to work with when their masters weren’t around.”\n\nBut behind the scenes, he began to undermine DOGE however he could. Sometimes he did this by making intemperate statements that he knew would find their way into the press and draw attention to what DOGE was asking him to do. “Have you ever worked with someone who’s manic-depressive?” he said of the Trump administration’s leadership in one meeting.\n\nOther times Dudek himself was the leaker. As commissioner, he was often an anonymous source for articles in The Washington Post and The New York Times. “If it was stupid stuff from the DOGE team, a lot of times I would go out to the press and immediately tattletale on myself so that it would blow up the next day,” Dudek said, adding that he did this in part to help Social Security advocates understand and bring attention to the growing crisis at the agency.\n\nRebecca Vallas, CEO of the nonprofit National Academy of Social Insurance, said she was in a one-on-one meeting with Dudek in March when he started getting calls from DOGE officials and the media. The calls were about his recent public comments claiming he might have to shut down the entire Social Security Administration if a federal judge continued to deny DOGE access to sensitive Social Security data. “He just let me sit there with the volume up high,” Vallas said.\n\nOn one of the calls, she said, someone told Dudek, “Elon loved that, but now it’s time to walk it back.” Afterward, Dudek told her, “I don’t know how we get out of this without hurting huge numbers of people. … I’m just trying to give advocates some ammunition.”\n\nDudek’s strategy was easier to pull off without DOGE catching on if it came off as the blundering of an amateur, he told ProPublica. In the most striking example, DOGE instructed Dudek to cancel two contracts that the SSA had with the state of Maine, according to Dudek and other SSA officials. The contracts, which all 50 states have long had versions of, allowed Maine to automatically report births and deaths to Social Security. Canceling them would impede government efficiency: Births and deaths in the state would take weeks or months longer to enter the federal system. That would likely cause benefits to continue to be sent to thousands of Mainers after they’ve died, exactly the kind of thing that Trump and Musk had been railing against.\n\nIt seemed clear to Dudek that he was being told to do this only because Trump was publicly feuding with Maine’s governor about transgender athletes. (The White House declined to comment on this episode.) So he decided to “write the hell out of” an email directing that the contracts be canceled. He did so in a way he thought would still earn him points with Trump and DOGE but that would, simultaneously, be so inflammatory that it would create a major storyline for reporters, advocates and Congress.\n\n“Please cancel the contracts,” Dudek’s email read. “While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child.” That last phrase referred to Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, the one Trump had been fighting with. (“Do I care about Janet Mills? No,” Dudek told ProPublica.)\n\nAs Dudek had hoped, the press attention he generated compelled him to do what he already wanted to do: reinstate the contracts. In a written apology, he explained that he was only belatedly realizing the potential harm of what he (alone) had done. “I screwed up,” he told reporters. “I’m new at this job.”\n\nOnce again, Miller called Dudek and excoriated him. “What the hell is going on?” she said.\n\n“This place leaks like a sieve,” he answered. “What can I tell you?”\n\nLooking back on his tenure, Dudek maintains that his three months working alongside DOGE were not as harmful as they could have been, especially compared with what happened this spring at other federal agencies, some of which were essentially vaporized. Social Security checks, he points out, are still going out the door.\n\nStill, the SSA is reduced in his wake, with thousands fewer staff members to process claims and improve systems. These departed employees were disproportionately experienced and knowledgeable; they were the ones able to get other jobs or to retire with a pension. They took a lot of know-how with them.\n\nAnd the emotional harm that DOGE caused to older people and to people with disabilities — worsened by Dudek’s confusing actions — lingers. Many of these people have had money taken out of their paychecks their entire careers to pay for something more than just retirement benefits: security. It’s a feeling that may now be lost to them forever.\n\nIndeed, DOGE and Dudek caused so much consternation about the stability of the system that hundreds of thousands of people have filed early for retirement in recent months, even though doing so is not financially wise in the long term. The SSA must now pay out more in benefits than expected, contrary to DOGE’s cost-saving mission.\n\nDudek’s sister back in Saginaw, Ana Dudek, relies on Social Security disability benefits. “I would talk to my brother when he was commissioner and be like, dude, the decisions you’re making are causing people to feel terror,” she said. “Terror is an apt descriptor.”\n\nDudek acknowledges much of this. “I’m not a cold, callous son of a bitch, I really do get it,” he said. “I’ll forever be associated with the pain of DOGE. … But so much went on in such a short amount of time. I tried to make the best decisions I could given the circumstances.”\n\nSince being dismissed from the agency in June, Dudek has been struggling to find another job. “My name is mud,” he said. “It is as if I no longer exist.”\n\nAs a former SSA colleague put it, Dudek’s story is “the story of a disposable pawn, and there’s lots of those under Trump. They just used him, and then they disposed of him.”\n\nThe White House, presented with extensive questions for this article, sent a one-paragraph statement disparaging ProPublica and Dudek. ProPublica’s story, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said, “is largely based around the comments of a disgruntled former employee who openly admitted to leaking to the media, manipulating his colleagues, and repeatedly telling lies from his official position. On his last day as Acting Commissioner, Leland Dudek showered praise upon President Trump in an op-ed and touted the ‘real results’ of the Social Security Administration, but now that he’s bitter about being out of the top job — he’s singing a different tune.”\n\nDudek said the administration asked him to write the op-ed and then vetted it. Referring to the litany of extravagant praise that cabinet secretaries lavished on Trump recently, he said, “you saw the cabinet meeting.”\n\nBisignano, the Social Security commissioner, comes to the role with a very different professional background than Dudek (though, like Dudek, he has working-class roots, in his case in Brooklyn). Until this job, Bisignano, 66, spent his career in the private sector. He was a top executive in operations and technology at massive banks like Citigroup and JPMorganChase and went on to become CEO of the payment processor Fiserv.\n\nYet, like DOGE, he appears to have embraced the appearance of efficiency rather than efficiency itself. He has repeatedly told staff that Social Security should be run more like Amazon, with AI handling more customer interactions. But disability claims are more complicated than ordering toothpaste, according to SSA officials and experts, and Social Security’s customer base is older and more likely to have an intellectual disability than the average Amazon Prime member.\n\nBisignano has also fixated on how much time it takes to reach an agent on the SSA’s 800 number. In a July press release, he claimed that the average was down to six minutes, an 80% reduction from 2024. He achieved this in part by reassigning 1,000 field office employees to phone duty. That means initial calls are getting answered faster, but there are significantly fewer staff members available to handle complex, in-person cases. And “reaching an agent” turns out to mean speaking to a human being — or an AI bot. Internal SSA statistics obtained by ProPublica reveal that Bisignano’s estimate treats cases in which beneficiaries interact with a chatbot and opt for a callback as “zero-minute” waits, skewing the average. If you actually stay on the line, USA Today has found, it often takes over an hour to reach a live representative.\n\nIn its statement, the SSA reiterated that call wait times have dramatically improved and that “using technology on our national 800 number has enabled 90 percent of calls handled to be served via automated self-service options or convenient callbacks.”\n\nEven the latest phone fraud policy feels like a rerun from DOGE’s earlier season. In late July, Bisignano’s team quietly posted a document to the Office of Management and Budget website stating that 3.4 million more people would have to go into field offices to verify their identities instead of being able to do so by phone, starting Aug. 18. Days later, the SSA announced that this was actually optional.\n\nThe DOGE era may officially be over at the agency, but the approach, it seems, is the same. As one SSA official put it, Bisignano is “doing all the same fundamentally inefficient things, more efficiently.”","summary":"The agency’s then acting chief helped DOGE at first, then tried to resist when he saw what it was doing, he said in interviews.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/the-untold-saga-of-what-happened-when-doge-stormed-social-security-2000655356","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/Elon-Musk-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-08 15:20:13","author":"Eli Hager,ProPublica","authors":["Eli Hager","ProPublica"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":358599790,"title":"Dems Reportedly Turn To Anti-ICE Senator In Cali Gov Race After Kamala Harris Passes On Run","text":"Some California Democrats are encouraging Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla to run in the state’s 2026 gubernatorial race, Politico reported on Monday.\n\nWhile some Sacramento Democrats want Padilla to run in California’s upcoming gubernatorial race, the senator still does not have the name recognition that other Golden State politicians — such as former Vice President Kamala Harris — do, according to Politico. The senator is reportedly weighing a bid to replace term-limited Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n“Padilla is part and has been part of the Sacramento culture,” Jodi Hicks, CEO and president of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of California, told Politico. “He came here very young and spent a lot of time with people and has deep relationships.” (RELATED: Alex Padilla Says Illegal Immigrants Are Long-Term Residents Who Just ‘Happen To Be Undocumented’)\n\nHarris announced in late July that she was passing on a bid for California’s governor’s mansion after months of speculation that she was weighing a run, leaving a wide-open contest. In late August, Padilla signaled openness to the idea of a potential run for California governor, telling Politico in an interview that he loves the state and hopes “to continue to serve in some capacity.” \n\nPadilla made headlines in June after he interrupted a press conference held by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kristi Noem, leading security to forcefully remove him from the conference room. The California Democrat ended up face down on the ground in handcuffs outside the press conference.\n\nPadilla has also kept up close relations with a group tied to anti-deportation riots in recent years, the Daily Caller News Foundation previously reported.\n\nAndrew Acosta, a Democratic political consultant, told Politico that some California voters are not yet “enamored with some of the other candidates” in the upcoming California gubernatorial race.\n\n“There’s a lot of the chattering class of Sacramento who haven’t yet been enamored with some of the other candidates,” Acosta told the outlet.\n\nSome recent polls have shown that Harris supporters now favor former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter — who has previously drawn criticism over anonymous complaints against her surfacing from Capitol Hill staffers in 2022 — in California’s upcoming gubernatorial race after Harris passed on a run.

Granted, it’s debatable that we will even have a legitimate presidential election in 2028, but let’s suppose something – the Supreme Court, a menu item from McDonald’s, a heart and soul transplant – managed to corral our budding American dictator into leaving the White House for good. In a recent Emerson College Polling national survey, the California governor has emerged as the frontrunner for the 2028 Democratic presidential primary, leading with 25% support—a 13-point increase from Emerson’s June poll. Following Newsom is former Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg, at 16%; former Vice President Kamala Harris, at 11%; Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, at 5%; and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker and Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, each at 4%. Newsom was tied with Vice President JD Vance with 44% support. Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling, noted that “Governor Newsom’s support surged across key demographic groups,” with particularly strong gains among younger voters who now favor him 45% to 28%. Newsom’s rise is rooted in his role helping stave off Republican gerrymandering efforts and, above all, the work of his social media team. On Wednesday, Trump told reporters that Newsom was “incompetent” and went on to lie and accuse him of being responsible for California’s water management policies that gave way to the wildfires in January. He also lied about the time he sicced the military on us in Los Angeles for a made-up controversy, claiming that the city is already starting to be overrun by protests. In response, Newsom took to X, writing, “So you can have them sleep on the floor again? We’re good,” with a photo showing several dozen troops sleeping on the floor during their deployment. It’s 2025, three years ahead of any election, so polling significance is questionable. Still, I talk to my people and notice that even those who are politically disconnected know Gavin Newsom’s name and like what they’ve seen. They go up for the simplest stuff like that tweet. And though we are a few years from an election, Mayor Pete will never be president. There will be white folks in mainstream media trying to fault Black people and homophobia for it, but the fact will remain that, as I wrote years ago for his first doomed presidential bid, his time as mayor shows that his disconnect with Black people can be rooted in failing to show up for us than his sexuality…which he doesn’t even highlight himself. As for the former vice president, I doubt she runs again, and even if she did, unless she is willing to be forthright about how awful an idea it was to have someone as old as Joe Biden seek reelection, it won’t matter. Josh Shapiro’s inability to acknowledge the pain of the Palestinian people will sink him. As for AOC, don’t sleep on her, but she may just put Chuck Schumer out of his misery already, so we’ll see. It’s early, yes, but opinions are forming, and I am noticing from my media consumption that many of the same forces and personalities that push Joe Biden as the only answer in a Democratic presidential primary are now doing that same work for Gavin. It all translates to one thing: only a white man can win. I don’t believe that, no matter what the last couple of election results were, but I do know that once media narratives are popularized and drilled in, the public tends to fall in line after a while. Source: Justin Sullivan / Getty For what it’s worth, I appreciate Gavin Newsom’s redistricting efforts in California and applaud any elected official who hires a social media team to make sure he doesn’t embarrass himself or his constituents. And considering how pathetic other Democratic leaders look in comparison, it is a relief to see someone “fight back.” However, as someone in California and familiar with the ways of Gavin Newsom, I am not nearly as charmed as some of y’all and am begging folks not to fall for the okie doke. Newsom may be a useful troll and GOP foil, but I don’t want people to forget that this is the same person who turned to the Supreme Court to criminalize homelessness and make it okay for cities to lock up homeless people for sleeping outside, regardless of whether they are offered shelter or if beds are available. Newsom promised to fight the crisis for nearly a decade and has failed to do anything in spite of having more power than ever to do something besides stripping people off the street so the more fortunate don’t have to be burdened with having to look at their suffering. I’ve seen this point raised and dismissed flippantly with the notion that now is not the time to pursue “perfection.” What people who say this really mean is that they don’t care about homeless people because they’ve fallen for the lie that poverty is punishment for personal failings. It’s the same line of thinking to ignore Gaza, police brutality, rising inequality, etc. From a moral standpoint, it’s abhorrent, but in terms of political strategy, by now it should be considered dumb. And yet, off we go, cheering on this, again, smarmy white man that’s proven to be better at boosting his own career at the expense of the most vulnerable. The one who yucks it up with racists on podcasts while throwing trans people under the bus for the Democrats’ failure. Newsom is getting way too much life from his parody of Trump, but it shouldn’t get to the point where, just like Donald, he cons his way to the White House pretending to be a man for the people when his background screams otherwise.

Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.\n\nOn Feb. 10, on the third floor of the Social Security Administration’s Baltimore-area headquarters, Leland Dudek unfurled a 4-foot-wide roll of paper that extended to 20 feet in length. It was a visual guide that the agency had kept for years to explain Social Security’s many technological systems and processes. The paper was covered in flow charts, arrows and text so minuscule you almost needed a magnifying glass to read it. Dudek called it Social Security’s “Dead Sea Scroll.”\n\nDudek and a fellow Social Security Administration bureaucrat taped the scroll across a wall of a windowless executive office. This was where a team from the new Department of Government Efficiency was going to set up shop.\n\nDOGE was already terrifying the federal bureaucracy with the prospect of mass job loss and intrusions into previously sacrosanct databases. Still, Dudek and a handful of his tech-oriented colleagues were hopeful: If any agency needed a dose of efficiency, it was theirs. “There was kind of an excitement, actually,” a longtime top agency official said. “I’d spent 29 years trying to use technology and data in ways that the agency would never get around to.”\n\nThe Social Security Administration is 90 years old. Even today, thousands of its physical records are stored in former limestone mines in Missouri and Pennsylvania. Its core software dates back to the early 1980s, and only a few programmers remain who understand the intricacies of its more than 60 million lines of code. The agency has been talking about switching from paper Social Security cards to electronic ones for two decades, without making it happen.\n\nDOGE, billed as a squad of crack technologists, seemed perfectly designed to overcome such obstacles. And its young members were initially inquisitive about how Social Security worked and what most needed fixing. Several times over those first few days, Akash Bobba, a 21-year-old coder who’d been the first of them to arrive, held his face close to Dudek’s scroll, tracing connections between the agency’s venerable IT systems with his index finger. Bobba asked: “Who would know about this part of the architecture?”\n\nBefore long, though, he and the other DOGErs buried their heads in their laptops and plugged in their headphones. Their senior leaders had already written out goals on a whiteboard. At the top: Find fraud. Quickly.\n\nDudek’s scroll was forgotten. The heavy paper started to unpeel from the wall, and it eventually sagged to the floor.\n\nIt only got worse from there, said Dudek, who would — improbably — be named acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, a position he held through May. In 15 hours of interviews with ProPublica, Dudek described the chaos of working with DOGE and how he tried first to collaborate, and then to protect the agency, resulting in turns that were at various times alarming, confounding and tragicomic.\n\nDOGE, he said, began acting like “a bunch of people who didn’t know what they were doing, with ideas of how government should run — thinking it should work like a McDonald’s or a bank — screaming all the time.”\n\nThe shock troops of DOGE, at the Social Security Administration and myriad other federal agencies, were the advance guard in perhaps the most dramatic transformation of the U.S. government since the New Deal. And despite the highly public departure of DOGE’s leader, Elon Musk, that campaign continues today. Key DOGE team members have transitioned to permanent jobs at the SSA, including as the agency’s top technology officials. The 19-year-old whose self-anointed moniker — “Big Balls” — has made him one of the most memorable DOGErs joined the agency this summer.\n\nThe DOGE philosophy has been embraced by the SSA’s commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who was confirmed by the Senate in May. “Your bias has to be — because mine is — that DOGE is helping make things better,” Bisignano told senior officials weeks after replacing Dudek, according to a recording obtained by ProPublica. “It may not feel that way, but don’t believe everything you read.”\n\nIn a statement, a Social Security Administration spokesperson said that Bisignano has made “notable” initial progress and that “the initiatives underway will continue to strengthen service delivery and enhance the integrity and efficiency of our systems.” The statement asserted that “under President Trump’s leadership and his commitment to protect and preserve Social Security, Commissioner Bisignano is strengthening Social Security and the programs it provides for Americans now and in the future.”\n\nFor all the controversy DOGE has generated, its time at the Social Security Administration has not amounted to looming armageddon, as some Democrats warn. What it’s been, as much as anything, is a missed opportunity, according to interviews with more than 35 current or recently departed Social Security officials and staff, who spoke on the condition of anonymity mostly out of fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, and a review of hundreds of pages of internal documents, emails and court records.\n\nThe DOGE team, and Bisignano, have prioritized scoring quick wins that allow them to post triumphant tweets and press releases — especially, in the early months, about an essentially nonexistent form of fraud — while squandering the chance for systemic change at an agency that genuinely needs it.\n\nThey could have worked to modernize Social Security’s legacy software, the current and former staffers say. They could have tried to streamline the stupefying volume of documentation that many Social Security beneficiaries have to provide. They could have built search tools to help staff navigate the agency’s 60,000 pages of policies. (New hires often need at least three years to master the nuances of even one type of case.) They could have done something about wait times for disability claims and appeals, which often take over a year.\n\nThey did none of these things.\n\nUltimately, no one had a more complete view of the missed opportunity than Lee Dudek. A 48-year-old with a shaved pate and a broad build that suggests an aging former linebacker, Dudek is a figure seemingly native to the universe of President Donald Trump — an unlikely holder of a key post, elevated after little or no vetting, who briefly attains notoriety in Washington circles before vanishing into obscurity — not unlike Anthony Scaramucci in the first Trump administration.\n\nDudek, a midlevel bureaucrat with blunt confidence and a preference for his own ideas, had failed in his one past attempt to manage a small team within the SSA, leading him and his supervisors to conclude he shouldn’t oversee others. Despite that, Trump made him the boss of 57,500 people as acting commissioner of the agency this spring.\n\nDudek got the job, wittingly or not, through an end-run around his bosses. After Trump won the 2024 election and rumors of a cost-cutting-and-efficiency SWAT team began to swirl, Dudek asked people he knew at big tech companies for introductions to potential DOGE members. In December, a contact set him up with Musk’s right-hand man, Steve Davis, which led to conversations with other DOGE figures about how they could “hack” Social Security’s bureaucracy to “get to yes,” Dudek said.\n\nBy February, Dudek had become the conduit between DOGE and the SSA, alerting top agency officials that DOGE wanted to work at headquarters. And unlike Michelle King, the acting agency chief at the time, Dudek was willing to speed up the new-hire training process to give DOGE access to virtually all of the SSA’s databases. This precipitated a sequence of events that began with him being placed on administrative leave, where he wrote a LinkedIn post that propelled him into the public eye for the first time: “I confess,” he posted. “I helped DOGE understand SSA. … I confess. I … circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done.” The same weekend, King resigned and Dudek, who was at home in his underwear watching MSNBC, got an email stating that the president of the United States had appointed him commissioner.\n\nBetween February and May, when Dudek’s tenure ended, his erratic rhetoric and decisions routinely made front-page news. He was often portrayed as a DOGE patsy, perhaps even a fool. But in his interviews with ProPublica this summer, he revealed himself to be a much more complex figure, a disappointed believer in DOGE’s potential, who maintains he did what he could to protect Social Security’s mission under duress.\n\nDudek is the first agency head to speak in detail on the record about what it is like to be thrust into such an important position under Trump. He told ProPublica that he decided to speak because he wishes that “those who govern” would have more frank and honest conversations with the public.\n\nTo the 73 million Americans whose financial lives depend on the viability of Social Security, those first months were a seesaw of apprehension and rumor. Inside the agency, Dudek, ill-prepared for leadership or for DOGE’s murky agenda, was stumbling through the chaos in part by creating some of his own.\n\nDudek knows what it’s like to depend on Social Security. When he was a kid in Saginaw, Michigan, his mother turned to Social Security disability benefits to support him and his siblings after she got injured at a Ford-affiliated parts factory; she also had a mental-health breakdown. (Dudek’s now-deceased father, who worked for General Motors, was alternately abusive and absent, according to the family.)\n\nAt school, Dudek was isolated and bullied for being poor, his sister told ProPublica, and he’s had an underdog’s quick temper ever since. But he was always an advanced student, and he developed an early interest in computer science and politics. As a teenager, he often watched C-Span. He was fascinated, he said, by “how government worked and how it could change people’s lives.”\n\nDudek arrived in Washington in 1995 to attend Catholic University of America. He was the type of earnest young man who was enthralled by President Bill Clinton’s campaign at the time to “reinvent government” by injecting it with private sector-style efficiency, much as Trump and DOGE later said they would.\n\nIn college, he also displayed the tendency to buck authority that would mark his professional career. He had a night job running the university’s computer labs; if there were problems, he was supposed to call his boss. He wasn’t supposed to install new software on all the computers, but that’s what he did. It worked, although he got a talking-to about knowing his role.\n\nAfter graduating, Dudek spent nearly a decade working for tech companies that contracted with the federal government on modernization projects, before migrating to several jobs within federal agencies themselves.\n\nIn 2009, he arrived at the Social Security Administration as an IT security official. The agency was just like the Saginaw he’d run from, Dudek said: an insular, hidebound place where everyone knew everyone and they all thought innovation would cost them their jobs.\n\nBut the SSA wasn’t the only institution at fault. Congress had enacted byzantine eligibility requirements for disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits, forcing the agency to expend huge amounts of time and money running those programs. At the same time, lawmakers had capped the agency’s administrative funding just as tens of millions of Baby Boomers were aging into retirement, exploding Social Security’s rolls. (The SSA is now at its lowest staffing level in a half-century, even as it has taken on 40 million more beneficiaries.)\n\nBecause of the SSA’s stultifying culture, Dudek said, he leaned into his insubordinate streak. He had the sense that he could do it better, and when he felt like his proposals weren’t receiving money or attention, he went around his superiors. In one instance, he approached potential partners at credit card companies, hoping they would like his ideas for combating fraud and would relay those ideas to the Social Security commissioner at the time. “Certainly from an internal perspective within SSA, certainly from a congressional perspective, I was violating rules,” Dudek said.\n\nIn part because of moves like this, Dudek got reassigned within the agency several times. Over the years, he was given multiple roles as a “senior adviser,” a title he said is for federal employees who are either incompetent but too established to fire or highly competent in a technical way but lacking in management or people skills.\n\nDudek was stubborn. He could come off as a know-it-all, and he tended to ramble when speaking. But he is also thoughtful and well read. In our interviews, he brought up everything from the origins of the concept of Social Security among sociologists and psychologists in the Depression era to the bureaucrats who were left behind in faraway places after the decline of the British Empire. He repeatedly cited James Q. Wilson’s seminal 1989 book, “Bureaucracy,” which spills considerable ink on the inefficiencies of the Social Security Administration — and on a businessman named Donald J. Trump who supposedly knew how to cut through red tape to get building projects done. (“No such law constrained Trump,” Wilson wrote.)Dudek had been a lifelong Democrat and voted for Kamala Harris. But, like some other liberals, he was becoming exasperated with the “administrative state” and special-interest groups, including corporations, unions and social-justice organizations, that “capture” government and stifle reform. If it took Trump to cut through that, Dudek was open-minded. “The world has changed,” he scribbled in a note to himself. “We must change with it.”\n\nImmediately after Dudek became commissioner in February, he got a call from Scott Coulter, a hedge fund manager with a $12 million Manhattan apartment who’d been picked to lead DOGE’s team at Social Security. “We’re coming,” Coulter said. “Be prepared.”\n\nDOGE arrived ready to embark on a specific mission: Its operatives at the Treasury Department had seen data suggesting that the Social Security Administration wasn’t keeping its death records up to date. They thought they saw signs of fraudulent payments. Musk was very, very interested.\n\nDudek wasn’t initially concerned about this focus, which he and his colleagues viewed as misguided. To him, the young coders were nerdy outsiders just like he’d once been, albeit ones from privileged Ivy League and Silicon Valley backgrounds. They “reminded me of myself when I first got into computers,” he said. He thought he could mold them.\n\nIn particular, Dudek liked Bobba, who had a gentle air and a thick pile of dark hair that covered his forehead. Dudek had spent hours with Bobba, trying to get him to focus on concrete problems like how beneficiaries’ records were stored, often as cumbersome PDF and image files. Instead, Bobba, who did not respond to a request for comment, prioritized Musk’s quest to prove that dead people were receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nBobba had completed high school in New Jersey just three and a half years earlier. As a class speaker at his graduation, he’d encouraged his classmates not to ignore “nuance” and “complexity.” He’d lamented the “increasing willingness to simplify even the most complex narratives into sensational tidbits” like “280-character tweets,” which “perpetuates misinformation.”\n\nYet Dudek had barely settled in as commissioner when Bobba unintentionally sparked a national misinformation firestorm: A table he created appeared as a screenshot in a grossly misleading Musk tweet about “vampires” over the age of 100 allegedly collecting Social Security checks. Bobba had sorted people with a Social Security number by age and found more than 12 million over 120 years old still listed in the agency’s data.\n\nBobba said he knew these people weren’t actually receiving benefits and tried to tell Musk so, to no avail, according to SSA officials. Dudek watched in horror as Trump then shared the same statistics with both houses of Congress and a national television audience, claiming the numbers proved “shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors.” (The White House declined to comment on this episode. Bisignano, the new SSA commissioner, has repeatedly said that “the work that DOGE did was 100% accurate.”)\n\nInside the SSA, the DOGE team tried to find proof of the fraud that Musk and Trump had proclaimed, but it didn’t seem to know how to go about it, jumping from tactic to tactic. “It was a maelstrom of topic A to topic G to topic C to topic Q,” said a senior SSA official who was in the room. “Were we still helping anything by explaining stuff?” the official said. “It really wasn’t clear by that point.”\n\nDudek began to realize that the problem wasn’t primarily the people he called the “DOGE kids.” It was the senior leaders who were issuing orders without heeding what the young DOGErs were learning.\n\nDudek was perhaps the most favorably disposed to the outsiders. Plenty of agency officials were already put off by the DOGErs, who often issued peremptory orders to meet with them and answer questions.\n\nMichelle Kowalski, an analyst who has since departed the agency, was instructed to take one of the DOGE people, Cole Killian, through earnings data and historical records to analyze the cases of extremely old people whose deaths had not been recorded in Social Security data. She found herself having to explain to him, again and again, that many of these people were born before states reported births and deaths to the federal government and decades before the advent of electronic record keeping. In the early days of the agency, some people didn’t even know their birthdays.\n\nKowalski had assumed that Killian was middle-aged, since he was issuing instructions to her team. But he usually kept his camera turned off during video meetings. When he finally turned it on for one call, the face she saw seemed like that of a teenager.\n\nKillian was actually 24, just six years removed from performing “Hotel California” at his high school talent show at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School outside of Boston. (Killian, whose DOGE responsibilities also involved work at the Environmental Protection Agency, did not respond to a request for comment from ProPublica.)\n\nKowalski was exasperated by having to answer to such inexperience, even as so many of her colleagues were being pushed out the door by the Trump administration. She was not alone.\n\n“Many of us had actually believed in the marketed idea of genius technologists coming in to make things work better,” one senior SSA official said. But DOGE ended up being more interested, the official said, in “trying to prove that the Social Security Administration was entirely incompetent” than in suggesting improvements.\n\nEmployees at headquarters took their time walking past the glass-walled conference room where DOGE staffers had set up, glaring in at them as they worked among stacks of laptops that they used for assignments at different agencies. On a blog popular among SSA staffers, the mood in the comments section turned dark, with some anonymous posters identifying where in the building the “incel DOGE boys” were located and saying that “they are just warming up … just think what will come next.”\n\nDudek sensed the growing tension. He felt it, too. He’d been getting anonymous death threats mailed to his house. He decided to move the DOGE operatives to a more secluded area of the campus and assigned an armed security detail to protect them.\n\nDuring his first month as commissioner, Dudek ran his executive meetings in bombastic fashion, as if he were Trump on “The Apprentice.” And he sent out insulting full-staff emails pressuring career employees to retire. (Some 5,500 have left, with 1,500 more expected to follow.)\n\nDudek says this behavior stemmed partly from being in over his head, amazed by who he was suddenly answering to. “When the president of the United States asks you to do stuff,” he said, “you get caught up.”\n\nBut he also claims he was just performing a role. “Early on, I put on a persona of a yeller,” Dudek said. (Multiple longtime colleagues and friends noticed the change, they told ProPublica. As one put it, “There’s Lee, and then there’s Leland-performingly-Dudek.”)\n\nThis, he hoped, would convince the White House and DOGE of his commitment, which could in turn give him credibility as he kept trying to push them toward the real issues at Social Security.\n\nBut the Trump administration kept having other plans. Its demands usually came through Coulter, the DOGE lead with the Harvard and hedge fund background, who early on dropped by Dudek’s office unannounced multiple times a week, Dudek said.\n\n“I really think it would be helpful if you were to do this tomorrow,” Coulter would say to Dudek about eliminating an entire division of the SSA or cutting more staff, according to Dudek. To him, these suggestions felt like orders. If he responded, “I don’t know, let me think about it,” Coulter would call a few hours later on the encrypted-messaging app Signal to ask, “You really aren’t catching on, are you?” and “Do you know how many times I’ve defended you?”\n\n“I was supposed to get the message — and it would be ‘my own decision,’ so I’d be stuck with it,” Dudek said. “He can say he never told me to do anything.” (Coulter, who has been working for DOGE at NASA in recent months, did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOne of Coulter’s suggestions involved the SSA’s Office of Transformation, which had been doing the seemingly DOGE-like work of developing an online application to replace many of the agency’s paper-based forms and in-person interviews. The office had been working with elderly, low-income and disabled people to see what most confused them about SSA processes and what would most help them if these were redesigned.\n\nBut instead of facilitating this effort at greater efficiency, Coulter told Dudek to close the office, according to Dudek, claiming it was wasteful. Agency staff joked that DOGE shut it down because its name included a word that began with “trans.”\n\nDudek and his colleagues sometimes attempted to co-opt DOGE’s obsessions in the hope that they could address a genuine problem at the agency. This strategy was not successful.\n\nSuch was the case with the issue of phone fraud. Knowing that the DOGErs would perk up at the mention of anything fraud-related, Dudek and other officials made a point of explaining that they’d been working on an initiative to block bots that had been calling the agency. The bots would impersonate beneficiaries, using dates of birth and other information that can be found on the internet, to try to change the beneficiaries’ bank-routing information and steal their benefits.\n\nIn 2024, Dudek had been on a team that spearheaded an effort to combat this type of fraud. The plans included running all phone-based requests for bank account changes against a Treasury Department database of suspicious accounts and analyzing such calls to verify whether they were being made from the vicinity of the address on file of the person purportedly calling.\n\nDOGE ignored the proposed solutions. Instead, the White House instructed Dudek to end all claims and direct-deposit transactions by phone. Beneficiaries would have to verify their own identities by using an often-confusing web portal or by traveling to a field office to do it in person. For millions of elderly or disabled people, these were daunting or impossible options.\n\nWhen this policy was rolled out at the end of March, beneficiaries panicked. Many flocked to field offices to preemptively provide proof of their identities even when they didn’t need to.\n\nBack at headquarters, in a weekly staff meeting, Dudek asked who could jump on the increasingly urgent task of making it easier to schedule field office appointments via the SSA website. “Well, Lee, you just fired that team,” one official answered, referring to the Office of Transformation. (Dudek said he asked this question on purpose to make sure DOGE heard the answer.)\n\nOver the course of six weeks under Dudek, the phone policy zigged and zagged a half dozen times — for example, the SSA adopted, then abandoned, a three-day waiting period to conduct an algorithmic fraud check on all calls — before finally ending up nearly where it began. Transactions could be carried out by phone again.\n\nThroughout this saga, Dudek was still getting calls from White House officials — most often from Katie Miller, DOGE’s spokesperson and the wife of Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s closest advisers. (Katie Miller went on to work for Musk before announcing plans to launch her own podcast. She did not respond to a request for comment.) Miller often called well into the evening, Dudek said, to chastise him about anything the press had reported that day that had caught the administration off guard.\n\nAs Dudek restored the phone policy to its pre-Trump version, Miller got angrier. “You changed the president’s policy,” she said, according to Dudek.\n\n“I’m like, ‘No, I’m still with the president’s policy,’” Dudek told Miller. But, if Social Security officials could implement the anti-fraud measures that he and his team had previously been planning, he said, they could “achieve the same end.” In that case, Dudek said, “we will do so and ease the friction point on the public.”\n\n“How dare you,” Miller said.\n\nIncreasingly dismayed, Dudek hatched a plan that seemed to embody his mix of good intentions, hubris and melodrama. He decided he would continue to play along with DOGE on the surface, in part so that Coulter and the other bigwigs would think he was still handling their business and thus spend less time at the agency. The younger DOGE team members, he said, were “easier to work with when their masters weren’t around.”\n\nBut behind the scenes, he began to undermine DOGE however he could. Sometimes he did this by making intemperate statements that he knew would find their way into the press and draw attention to what DOGE was asking him to do. “Have you ever worked with someone who’s manic-depressive?” he said of the Trump administration’s leadership in one meeting.\n\nOther times Dudek himself was the leaker. As commissioner, he was often an anonymous source for articles in The Washington Post and The New York Times. “If it was stupid stuff from the DOGE team, a lot of times I would go out to the press and immediately tattletale on myself so that it would blow up the next day,” Dudek said, adding that he did this in part to help Social Security advocates understand and bring attention to the growing crisis at the agency.\n\nRebecca Vallas, CEO of the nonprofit National Academy of Social Insurance, said she was in a one-on-one meeting with Dudek in March when he started getting calls from DOGE officials and the media. The calls were about his recent public comments claiming he might have to shut down the entire Social Security Administration if a federal judge continued to deny DOGE access to sensitive Social Security data. “He just let me sit there with the volume up high,” Vallas said.\n\nOn one of the calls, she said, someone told Dudek, “Elon loved that, but now it’s time to walk it back.” Afterward, Dudek told her, “I don’t know how we get out of this without hurting huge numbers of people. … I’m just trying to give advocates some ammunition.”\n\nDudek’s strategy was easier to pull off without DOGE catching on if it came off as the blundering of an amateur, he told ProPublica. In the most striking example, DOGE instructed Dudek to cancel two contracts that the SSA had with the state of Maine, according to Dudek and other SSA officials. The contracts, which all 50 states have long had versions of, allowed Maine to automatically report births and deaths to Social Security. Canceling them would impede government efficiency: Births and deaths in the state would take weeks or months longer to enter the federal system. That would likely cause benefits to continue to be sent to thousands of Mainers after they’ve died, exactly the kind of thing that Trump and Musk had been railing against.\n\nIt seemed clear to Dudek that he was being told to do this only because Trump was publicly feuding with Maine’s governor about transgender athletes. (The White House declined to comment on this episode.) So he decided to “write the hell out of” an email directing that the contracts be canceled. He did so in a way he thought would still earn him points with Trump and DOGE but that would, simultaneously, be so inflammatory that it would create a major storyline for reporters, advocates and Congress.\n\n“Please cancel the contracts,” Dudek’s email read. “While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child.” That last phrase referred to Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, the one Trump had been fighting with. (“Do I care about Janet Mills? No,” Dudek told ProPublica.)\n\nAs Dudek had hoped, the press attention he generated compelled him to do what he already wanted to do: reinstate the contracts. In a written apology, he explained that he was only belatedly realizing the potential harm of what he (alone) had done. “I screwed up,” he told reporters. “I’m new at this job.”\n\nOnce again, Miller called Dudek and excoriated him. “What the hell is going on?” she said.\n\n“This place leaks like a sieve,” he answered. “What can I tell you?”\n\nLooking back on his tenure, Dudek maintains that his three months working alongside DOGE were not as harmful as they could have been, especially compared with what happened this spring at other federal agencies, some of which were essentially vaporized. Social Security checks, he points out, are still going out the door.\n\nStill, the SSA is reduced in his wake, with thousands fewer staff members to process claims and improve systems. These departed employees were disproportionately experienced and knowledgeable; they were the ones able to get other jobs or to retire with a pension. They took a lot of know-how with them.\n\nAnd the emotional harm that DOGE caused to older people and to people with disabilities — worsened by Dudek’s confusing actions — lingers. Many of these people have had money taken out of their paychecks their entire careers to pay for something more than just retirement benefits: security. It’s a feeling that may now be lost to them forever.\n\nIndeed, DOGE and Dudek caused so much consternation about the stability of the system that hundreds of thousands of people have filed early for retirement in recent months, even though doing so is not financially wise in the long term. The SSA must now pay out more in benefits than expected, contrary to DOGE’s cost-saving mission.\n\nDudek’s sister back in Saginaw, Ana Dudek, relies on Social Security disability benefits. “I would talk to my brother when he was commissioner and be like, dude, the decisions you’re making are causing people to feel terror,” she said. “Terror is an apt descriptor.”\n\nDudek acknowledges much of this. “I’m not a cold, callous son of a bitch, I really do get it,” he said. “I’ll forever be associated with the pain of DOGE. … But so much went on in such a short amount of time. I tried to make the best decisions I could given the circumstances.”\n\nSince being dismissed from the agency in June, Dudek has been struggling to find another job. “My name is mud,” he said. “It is as if I no longer exist.”\n\nAs a former SSA colleague put it, Dudek’s story is “the story of a disposable pawn, and there’s lots of those under Trump. They just used him, and then they disposed of him.”\n\nThe White House, presented with extensive questions for this article, sent a one-paragraph statement disparaging ProPublica and Dudek. ProPublica’s story, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said, “is largely based around the comments of a disgruntled former employee who openly admitted to leaking to the media, manipulating his colleagues, and repeatedly telling lies from his official position. On his last day as Acting Commissioner, Leland Dudek showered praise upon President Trump in an op-ed and touted the ‘real results’ of the Social Security Administration, but now that he’s bitter about being out of the top job — he’s singing a different tune.”\n\nDudek said the administration asked him to write the op-ed and then vetted it. Referring to the litany of extravagant praise that cabinet secretaries lavished on Trump recently, he said, “you saw the cabinet meeting.”\n\nBisignano, the Social Security commissioner, comes to the role with a very different professional background than Dudek (though, like Dudek, he has working-class roots, in his case in Brooklyn). Until this job, Bisignano, 66, spent his career in the private sector. He was a top executive in operations and technology at massive banks like Citigroup and JPMorganChase and went on to become CEO of the payment processor Fiserv.Yet, like DOGE, he appears to have embraced the appearance of efficiency rather than efficiency itself. He has repeatedly told staff that Social Security should be run more like Amazon, with AI handling more customer interactions. But disability claims are more complicated than ordering toothpaste, according to SSA officials and experts, and Social Security’s customer base is older and more likely to have an intellectual disability than the average Amazon Prime member.\n\nBisignano has also fixated on how much time it takes to reach an agent on the SSA’s 800 number. In a July press release, he claimed that the average was down to six minutes, an 80% reduction from 2024. He achieved this in part by reassigning 1,000 field office employees to phone duty. That means initial calls are getting answered faster, but there are significantly fewer staff members available to handle complex, in-person cases. And “reaching an agent” turns out to mean speaking to a human being — or an AI bot. Internal SSA statistics obtained by ProPublica reveal that Bisignano’s estimate treats cases in which beneficiaries interact with a chatbot and opt for a callback as “zero-minute” waits, skewing the average. If you actually stay on the line, USA Today has found, it often takes over an hour to reach a live representative.\n\nIn its statement, the SSA reiterated that call wait times have dramatically improved and that “using technology on our national 800 number has enabled 90 percent of calls handled to be served via automated self-service options or convenient callbacks.”\n\nEven the latest phone fraud policy feels like a rerun from DOGE’s earlier season. In late July, Bisignano’s team quietly posted a document to the Office of Management and Budget website stating that 3.4 million more people would have to go into field offices to verify their identities instead of being able to do so by phone, starting Aug. 18. Days later, the SSA announced that this was actually optional.\n\nThe DOGE era may officially be over at the agency, but the approach, it seems, is the same. As one SSA official put it, Bisignano is “doing all the same fundamentally inefficient things, more efficiently.”\n\nAlex Mierjeski contributed research.","summary":"This story first appeared at&#160;ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

Polis and U.S. senators — amid party’s slide","text":"Colorado’s top elected Democrats are all underwater with Colorado voters a little over a year out from big 2026 elections, according to a new poll released Monday.\n\nU.S. Sens. Michael Bennet and John Hickenlooper each notched approval ratings below 40% in the poll, with their disapproval ratings reaching 44% and 49%, respectively. Gov. Jared Polis’ approval was slightly better, at 41% — though that came with the caveat that a majority of voters, 52%, outright disapproved of the term-limited governor, according to the survey by Broomfield-based Magellan Strategies.\n\nThe rotten marks for the politicians fall within Colorado voters’ general malaise for politics. Both the Republican and Democratic parties had identical top-line favorabilities — of 68% negative versus 30% positive — albeit with different undercurrents driving the disdain for either.\n\nAnd a majority of Colorado voters in the survey thought the state was on the wrong track. A majority predicted the state and national economies would take downward turns in the next 12 months.\n\nThough Polis won’t be on next year’s ballot, Bennet is running to succeed him as governor and Hickenlooper is up for reelection. The poll did not ask respondents about Bennet’s leading Democratic primary opponent, Attorney General Phil Weiser.\n\nThe results show Coloradans in a bleak state of mind — but not necessarily looking to shed the state’s recent blue streak.\n\n“Although Colorado remains a blue state, the well-documented decline in the national Democratic Party’s image rating and brand is real and apparent among Colorado voters,” David Flaherty, CEO of Magellan, said in an email. \n\n“However,” he added, “it does not mean (President Donald) Trump and the Republicans are winning over hearts and minds. If they were, the wide range of Trump policies we tested would be getting better job approval ratings.”\n\nThe poll was conducted July 30 through Aug. 12 using text-message outreach. Pollsters surveyed 1,136 registered voters, and the data has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. Magellan, a conservative-leaning firm that often conducts polling for clients, paid for the poll itself.\n\nDemocrats still well-positioned for 2026\n\nBy more than 2-to-1 margins, Colorado voters surveyed didn’t feel good about the Democratic Party — and the disdain was shared by many Democratic voters. \n\nAmong those who voted for Kamala Harris for president last year, 47% reported unfavorable opinions of the party. Of registered Democrats, 41% reported unfavorable opinions toward their party.\n\nAs an anonymous Democratic woman in Arapahoe County characterized it in her survey response, the party has “no backbone, no follow-through, poor (or no) response to both mundane and gripping issues.”\n\nThe Democrats' hole only deepened among unaffiliated voters, the largest voting bloc in the state. Seventy percent of those voters expressed an unfavorable opinion of the party. \n\nThe only silver lining for Democrats? Unaffiliated voters feel the same about the GOP.\n\nThe poll found voters’ problems with Democrats were reflected on some of the top officials in the state. Democrats hold every statewide office in Colorado and control both chambers of the state legislature.\n\nPolis, who's entering his final year as governor due to term limits, was 11 points underwater in voter approval in the poll. That includes disapproval of his job performance by 24% of registered Democrats and Harris voters, and by half of unaffiliated voters.\n\nBennet and Hickenlooper find themselves in similar positions. \n\nBennet had 44% disapproval to 38% approval. Among Democrats and Harris voters, his approval jumped to 61% and 62%, respectively, though he was also underwater with unaffiliated voters at 39% approval and 45% disapproval.\n\nHowever, the poor showing for Democrats doesn’t seem to put a terrible damper on their prospects heading into the next general election in 2026. \n\nWhen asked how they'd vote If the election were held today, 50% of respondents said they would probably or definitely support the Democratic nominee for governor, versus 38% who'd support the Republican. \n\nIf congressional elections were held today, voters also gave Democrats a clear advantage in four of the state's eight congressional districts -- the ones currently represented by Democrats. The smaller sample size at the district level, however, came with larger margins of error of more than 8 percentage points. \n\nThe party also held a smaller edge for a fifth seat, according to the poll -- and a surprising one at that. \n\nThe poll found 47% of voters in the typically red 5th Congressional District in El Paso County would probably support the Democratic nominee there, versus 39% for the Republican nominee. In 2024, Republican Rep. Jeff Crank won the seat with nearly 55% of the vote.\n\nIn two other Republican seats -- the contentious 8th Congressional District, held by Rep. Gabe Evans, and the 3rd Congressional District, held by Rep. Jeff Hurd -- the poll results show the eventual GOP nominees with 5-point advantages, though the party doesn't crack 50% support in either case. The 4th Congressional District, now represented by Rep.

Many attendees missed the start of the match, even after organizers postponed it.\n\nDecked in a suit adorned with a long, red tie, Trump briefly emerged from his suite roughly 45 minutes prior to the match’s commencement. The nearly vacant Arthur Ashe Stadium responded with a blend of boos and cheers. His appearance wasn’t announced, and was fleeting enough that some in the audience didn’t catch sight of it.\n\nTrump reappeared to more boos before the National Anthem. During the anthem, as the president was shown briefly on the arena’s big screens standing in salute, he offered a smirk that amplified the booing.\n\nPost-anthem, the Republican acknowledged a small cluster of nearby supporters before settling on the suite’s balcony to attentively watch the match. He largely refrained from applauding, even after key points stirred the crowd, as Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz prevailed over Italy’s Jannik Sinner.\n\nAfter the first set, Trump reappeared on the big screen, ensuing a louder wave of boos and sharp whistles. He responded by raising his left fist in salute amidst the continued audible disapproval from the large stadium, which can host 24,000 people.\n\nThe president later retreated inside his suite, seen seated with family members presumably dining, but returned to his seat shortly before the match’s conclusion. As Alcaraz celebrated, cameras quickly flashed to Trump, whose reaction remained subdued. At this point, the crowd offered minimal response as well.\n\nOrganizers pushed the start of the match back half an hour to give people more time to pass through enhanced screening checkpoints reminiscent of security at airports. Still, thousands of increasingly frustrated fans remained in line outside as the match got underway. Many seats, especially those in upper rows, stayed empty for nearly an hour.\n\nThe Secret Service issued a statement saying that protecting Trump “required a comprehensive effort” and noting that it “may have contributed to delays for attendees.”\n\n“We sincerely thank every fan for their patience and understanding,” it said.\n\nTrump attended the final as a guest of Rolex, despite imposing steep tariffs on the Swiss watchmaker’s home country. The U.S. Tennis Association also tried to limit negative reaction to Trump’s attendance being shown on ABC’s national telecast, saying in a statement before play began: “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions.”\n\nThe reactions to Trump didn’t ultimately constitute big disruptions, though.\n\nGoing to the U.S. Open was the latest example of Trump having built the bulk of his second term’s domestic travel around attending major sports events rather than hitting the road to make policy announcements or address the kind of large rallies he so relished as a candidate.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January and prior to Sunday’s U.S Open swing, Trump has gone to the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the Daytona 500, as well as UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia and the FIFA Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Some of those crowds cheered him, but people booed him at other events.\n\nThe president accepted Rolex’s invitation despite his administration imposing a whopping 39% tariff on Swiss products. That’s more than 2 1/2 times higher than levies on European Union goods exported to the U.S. and nearly four times higher than on British exports to the U.S.\n\nThe White House declined to comment on Trump accepting a corporate client’s invitation at the tournament, but the president has had few qualms about blurring lines between political and foreign policy decisions and efforts to boost the profits of his family business. He’s tirelessly promoted his cryptocurrency interests and luxury golf properties, and even announced that the U.S. will host the Group of 20 summit in December 2026 at his Doral golf resort in Florida.\n\nNo large street protests against Trump could be seen from the tournament’s main stadium on Sunday. But attendees also steered clear of wearing any of the the Republican’s signature “Make America Great Again” caps.\n\nA 58-year-old tennis fan originally from Turin, Italy, came from her home in the Boston area to watch the final and said that when she bought a U.S. Open cap, she went with a fuchsia-hued one so it wouldn’t be mistaken for the signature darker color of MAGA hats.\n\n“I was careful not to get the red one,” said the fan, who declined to give her name because of her employer’s rules about being publicly quoted.\n\nAmong those attending with Trump were White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. Trump spent various portions of the match engaged in conversation with many of those around him.\n\nElsewhere in the crowd were a slew of celebrities — some of whom publicly backed then-Vice President Kamala Harris during last year’s election. Among them were Pink, Bruce Springsteen and Shonda Rhimes. In pre-match interviews shown on large stadium screens with the likes of Martha Stewart and Jon Hamm, the questions asked stuck to tennis and pop culture — not Trump and politics.\n\nThe president nonetheless was excited enough about his trip to tell reporters on Air Force One during the flight to New York when the plane flew over Ashe stadium — though the covered roof kept those inside from reacting.\n\nTrump was once a U.S. Open mainstay, but hadn’t attended since he was booed at a quarterfinals match in September 2015, months after launching his first presidential campaign.\n\nThe Trump Organization once controlled its own U.S. Open suite, which was adjacent to the stadium’s television broadcasting booth, but suspended it in 2017, during the first year of Trump’s first term. The family business is now being run by Trump’s sons with their father back in the White House.\n\nTrump was born in Queens, home of the U.S. Open, and for decades was a New York-area real estate mogul and, later, a reality TV star. Attending the tournament before he was a politician, he usually sat in his company’s suite’s balcony during night matches and was frequently shown on the arena’s video screens.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNEW YORK (AP) — At the U.S. Open men&#8217;s final on Sunday,&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump&#8217;s Appearance at US Open Leads to Boos and Delays Due to Increased Security first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/trumps-appearance-at-us-open-leads-to-boos-and-delays-due-to-increased-security/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Trump039s-US-Open-visit-sparks-boos-long-security-lines.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-08 10:57:04","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.024},{"id":358515024,"title":"'Story of a disposable pawn': What really happened when Trumpworld invaded Social Security","text":"On Feb. 10, on the third floor of the Social Security Administration’s Baltimore-area headquarters, Leland Dudek unfurled a 4-foot-wide roll of paper that extended to 20 feet in length. It was a visual guide that the agency had kept for years to explain Social Security’s many technological systems and processes. The paper was covered in flow charts, arrows and text so minuscule you almost needed a magnifying glass to read it. Dudek called it Social Security’s “Dead Sea Scroll.”\n\nDudek and a fellow Social Security Administration bureaucrat taped the scroll across a wall of a windowless executive office. This was where a team from the new Department of Government Efficiency was going to set up shop.\n\nDOGE was already terrifying the federal bureaucracy with the prospect of mass job loss and intrusions into previously sacrosanct databases. Still, Dudek and a handful of his tech-oriented colleagues were hopeful: If any agency needed a dose of efficiency, it was theirs. “There was kind of an excitement, actually,” a longtime top agency official said. “I’d spent 29 years trying to use technology and data in ways that the agency would never get around to.”\n\nThe Social Security Administration is 90 years old. Even today, thousands of its physical records are stored in former limestone mines in Missouri and Pennsylvania. Its core software dates back to the early 1980s, and only a few programmers remain who understand the intricacies of its more than 60 million lines of code. The agency has been talking about switching from paper Social Security cards to electronic ones for two decades, without making it happen.\n\nDOGE, billed as a squad of crack technologists, seemed perfectly designed to overcome such obstacles. And its young members were initially inquisitive about how Social Security worked and what most needed fixing. Several times over those first few days, Akash Bobba, a 21-year-old coder who’d been the first of them to arrive, held his face close to Dudek’s scroll, tracing connections between the agency’s venerable IT systems with his index finger. Bobba asked: “Who would know about this part of the architecture?”\n\nBefore long, though, he and the other DOGErs buried their heads in their laptops and plugged in their headphones. Their senior leaders had already written out goals on a whiteboard. At the top: Find fraud. Quickly.\n\nDudek’s scroll was forgotten. The heavy paper started to unpeel from the wall, and it eventually sagged to the floor.\n\nIt only got worse from there, said Dudek, who would — improbably — be named acting commissioner of the Social Security Administration, a position he held through May. In 15 hours of interviews with ProPublica, Dudek described the chaos of working with DOGE and how he tried first to collaborate, and then to protect the agency, resulting in turns that were at various times alarming, confounding and tragicomic.\n\nDOGE, he said, began acting like “a bunch of people who didn’t know what they were doing, with ideas of how government should run — thinking it should work like a McDonald’s or a bank — screaming all the time.”\n\nThe shock troops of DOGE, at the Social Security Administration and myriad other federal agencies, were the advance guard in perhaps the most dramatic transformation of the U.S. government since the New Deal. And despite the highly public departure of DOGE’s leader, Elon Musk, that campaign continues today. Key DOGE team members have transitioned to permanent jobs at the SSA, including as the agency’s top technology officials. The 19-year-old whose self-anointed moniker — “Big Balls” — has made him one of the most memorable DOGErs joined the agency this summer.\n\nThe DOGE philosophy has been embraced by the SSA’s commissioner, Frank Bisignano, who was confirmed by the Senate in May. “Your bias has to be — because mine is — that DOGE is helping make things better,” Bisignano told senior officials weeks after replacing Dudek, according to a recording obtained by ProPublica. “It may not feel that way, but don’t believe everything you read.”\n\nIn a statement, a Social Security Administration spokesperson said that Bisignano has made “notable” initial progress and that “the initiatives underway will continue to strengthen service delivery and enhance the integrity and efficiency of our systems.” The statement asserted that “under President Trump’s leadership and his commitment to protect and preserve Social Security, Commissioner Bisignano is strengthening Social Security and the programs it provides for Americans now and in the future.”\n\nFor all the controversy DOGE has generated, its time at the Social Security Administration has not amounted to looming armageddon, as some Democrats warn. What it’s been, as much as anything, is a missed opportunity, according to interviews with more than 35 current or recently departed Social Security officials and staff, who spoke on the condition of anonymity mostly out of fear of retaliation by the Trump administration, and a review of hundreds of pages of internal documents, emails and court records.\n\nThe DOGE team, and Bisignano, have prioritized scoring quick wins that allow them to post triumphant tweets and press releases — especially, in the early months, about an essentially nonexistent form of fraud — while squandering the chance for systemic change at an agency that genuinely needs it.\n\nThey could have worked to modernize Social Security’s legacy software, the current and former staffers say. They could have tried to streamline the stupefying volume of documentation that many Social Security beneficiaries have to provide. They could have built search tools to help staff navigate the agency’s 60,000 pages of policies. (New hires often need at least three years to master the nuances of even one type of case.) They could have done something about wait times for disability claims and appeals, which often take over a year.\n\nThey did none of these things.\n\nUltimately, no one had a more complete view of the missed opportunity than Lee Dudek. A 48-year-old with a shaved pate and a broad build that suggests an aging former linebacker, Dudek is a figure seemingly native to the universe of President Donald Trump — an unlikely holder of a key post, elevated after little or no vetting, who briefly attains notoriety in Washington circles before vanishing into obscurity — not unlike Anthony Scaramucci in the first Trump administration.\n\nDudek, a midlevel bureaucrat with blunt confidence and a preference for his own ideas, had failed in his one past attempt to manage a small team within the SSA, leading him and his supervisors to conclude he shouldn’t oversee others. Despite that, Trump made him the boss of 57,500 people as acting commissioner of the agency this spring.\n\nDudek got the job, wittingly or not, through an end-run around his bosses. After Trump won the 2024 election and rumors of a cost-cutting-and-efficiency SWAT team began to swirl, Dudek asked people he knew at big tech companies for introductions to potential DOGE members. In December, a contact set him up with Musk’s right-hand man, Steve Davis, which led to conversations with other DOGE figures about how they could “hack” Social Security’s bureaucracy to “get to yes,” Dudek said.\n\nBy February, Dudek had become the conduit between DOGE and the SSA, alerting top agency officials that DOGE wanted to work at headquarters. And unlike Michelle King, the acting agency chief at the time, Dudek was willing to speed up the new-hire training process to give DOGE access to virtually all of the SSA’s databases. This precipitated a sequence of events that began with him being placed on administrative leave, where he wrote a LinkedIn post that propelled him into the public eye for the first time: “I confess,” he posted. “I helped DOGE understand SSA. … I confess. I … circumvented the chain of command to connect DOGE with the people who get stuff done.” The same weekend, King resigned and Dudek, who was at home in his underwear watching MSNBC, got an email stating that the president of the United States had appointed him commissioner.\n\nBetween February and May, when Dudek’s tenure ended, his erratic rhetoric and decisions routinely madefront-page news. He was often portrayed as a DOGE patsy, perhaps even a fool. But in his interviews with ProPublica this summer, he revealed himself to be a much more complex figure, a disappointed believer in DOGE’s potential, who maintains he did what he could to protect Social Security’s mission under duress.\n\nDudek is the first agency head to speak in detail on the record about what it is like to be thrust into such an important position under Trump. He told ProPublica that he decided to speak because he wishes that “those who govern” would have more frank and honest conversations with the public.\n\nTo the 73 million Americans whose financial lives depend on the viability of Social Security, those first months were a seesaw of apprehension and rumor. Inside the agency, Dudek, ill-prepared for leadership or for DOGE’s murky agenda, was stumbling through the chaos in part by creating some of his own.\n\nDudek knows what it’s like to depend on Social Security. When he was a kid in Saginaw, Michigan, his mother turned to Social Security disability benefits to support him and his siblings after she got injured at a Ford-affiliated parts factory; she also had a mental-health breakdown. (Dudek’s now-deceased father, who worked for General Motors, was alternately abusive and absent, according to the family.)\n\nAt school, Dudek was isolated and bullied for being poor, his sister told ProPublica, and he’s had an underdog’s quick temper ever since. But he was always an advanced student, and he developed an early interest in computer science and politics. As a teenager, he often watched C-Span. He was fascinated, he said, by “how government worked and how it could change people’s lives.”\n\nDudek arrived in Washington in 1995 to attend Catholic University of America. He was the type of earnest young man who was enthralled by President Bill Clinton’s campaign at the time to “reinvent government” by injecting it with private sector-style efficiency, much as Trump and DOGE later said they would.\n\nIn college, he also displayed the tendency to buck authority that would mark his professional career. He had a night job running the university’s computer labs; if there were problems, he was supposed to call his boss. He wasn’t supposed to install new software on all the computers, but that’s what he did. It worked, although he got a talking-to about knowing his role.\n\nAfter graduating, Dudek spent nearly a decade working for tech companies that contracted with the federal government on modernization projects, before migrating to several jobs within federal agencies themselves.\n\nIn 2009, he arrived at the Social Security Administration as an IT security official. The agency was just like the Saginaw he’d run from, Dudek said: an insular, hidebound place where everyone knew everyone and they all thought innovation would cost them their jobs.\n\nBut the SSA wasn’t the only institution at fault. Congress had enacted byzantine eligibility requirements for disability and Supplemental Security Income benefits, forcing the agency to expend huge amounts of time and money running those programs. At the same time, lawmakers had capped the agency’s administrative funding just as tens of millions of Baby Boomers were aging into retirement, exploding Social Security’s rolls. (The SSA is now at its lowest staffing level in a half-century, even as it has taken on 40 million more beneficiaries.)\n\nBecause of the SSA’s stultifying culture, Dudek said, he leaned into his insubordinate streak. He had the sense that he could do it better, and when he felt like his proposals weren’t receiving money or attention, he went around his superiors. In one instance, he approached potential partners at credit card companies, hoping they would like his ideas for combating fraud and would relay those ideas to the Social Security commissioner at the time. “Certainly from an internal perspective within SSA, certainly from a congressional perspective, I was violating rules,” Dudek said.\n\nIn part because of moves like this, Dudek got reassigned within the agency several times. Over the years, he was given multiple roles as a “senior adviser,” a title he said is for federal employees who are either incompetent but too established to fire or highly competent in a technical way but lacking in management or people skills.\n\nDudek was stubborn. He could come off as a know-it-all, and he tended to ramble when speaking. But he is also thoughtful and well read. In our interviews, he brought up everything from the origins of the concept of Social Security among sociologists and psychologists in the Depression era to the bureaucrats who were left behind in faraway places after the decline of the British Empire. He repeatedly cited James Q. Wilson’s seminal 1989 book, “Bureaucracy,” which spills considerable ink on the inefficiencies of the Social Security Administration — and on a businessman named Donald J. Trump who supposedly knew how to cut through red tape to get building projects done. (“No such law constrained Trump,” Wilson wrote.)\n\nDudek had been a lifelong Democrat and voted for Kamala Harris. But, like some other liberals, he was becoming exasperated with the “administrative state” and special-interest groups, including corporations, unions and social-justice organizations, that “capture” government and stifle reform. If it took Trump to cut through that, Dudek was open-minded. “The world has changed,” he scribbled in a note to himself. “We must change with it.”\n\nImmediately after Dudek became commissioner in February, he got a call from Scott Coulter, a hedge fund manager with a $12 million Manhattan apartment who’d been picked to lead DOGE’s team at Social Security. “We’re coming,” Coulter said. “Be prepared.”\n\nDOGE arrived ready to embark on a specific mission: Its operatives at the Treasury Department had seen data suggesting that the Social Security Administration wasn’t keeping its death records up to date. They thought they saw signs of fraudulent payments. Musk was very, very interested.\n\nDudek wasn’t initially concerned about this focus, which he and his colleagues viewed as misguided. To him, the young coders were nerdy outsiders just like he’d once been, albeit ones from privileged Ivy League and Silicon Valley backgrounds. They “reminded me of myself when I first got into computers,” he said. He thought he could mold them.\n\nIn particular, Dudek liked Bobba, who had a gentle air and a thick pile of dark hair that covered his forehead. Dudek had spent hours with Bobba, trying to get him to focus on concrete problems like how beneficiaries’ records were stored, often as cumbersome PDF and image files. Instead, Bobba, who did not respond to a request for comment, prioritized Musk’s quest to prove that dead people were receiving Social Security benefits.\n\nBobba had completed high school in New Jersey just three and a half years earlier. As a class speaker at his graduation, he’d encouraged his classmates not to ignore “nuance” and “complexity.” He’d lamented the “increasing willingness to simplify even the most complex narratives into sensational tidbits” like “280-character tweets,” which “perpetuates misinformation.”\n\nYet Dudek had barely settled in as commissioner when Bobba unintentionally sparked a national misinformation firestorm: A table he created appeared as a screenshot in a grossly misleading Musk tweet about “vampires” over the age of 100 allegedly collecting Social Security checks. Bobba had sorted people with a Social Security number by age and found more than 12 million over 120 years old still listed in the agency’s data.\n\nBobba said he knew these people weren’t actually receiving benefits and tried to tell Musk so, to no avail, according to SSA officials. Dudek watched in horror as Trump then shared the same statistics with both houses of Congress and a national television audience, claiming the numbers proved “shocking levels of incompetence and probable fraud in the Social Security program for our seniors.” (The White House declined to comment on this episode. Bisignano, the new SSA commissioner, has repeatedlysaid that “the work that DOGE did was 100% accurate.”)\n\nInside the SSA, the DOGE team tried to find proof of the fraud that Musk and Trump had proclaimed, but it didn’t seem to know how to go about it, jumping from tactic to tactic. “It was a maelstrom of topic A to topic G to topic C to topic Q,” said a senior SSA official who was in the room. “Were we still helping anything by explaining stuff?” the official said. “It really wasn’t clear by that point.”\n\nDudek began to realize that the problem wasn’t primarily the people he called the “DOGE kids.” It was the senior leaders who were issuing orders without heeding what the young DOGErs were learning.\n\nDudek was perhaps the most favorably disposed to the outsiders. Plenty of agency officials were already put off by the DOGErs, who often issued peremptory orders to meet with them and answer questions.\n\nMichelle Kowalski, an analyst who has since departed the agency, was instructed to take one of the DOGE people, Cole Killian, through earnings data and historical records to analyze the cases of extremely old people whose deaths had not been recorded in Social Security data. She found herself having to explain to him, again and again, that many of these people were born before states reported births and deaths to the federal government and decades before the advent of electronic record keeping. In the early days of the agency, some people didn’t even know their birthdays.\n\nKowalski had assumed that Killian was middle-aged, since he was issuing instructions to her team. But he usually kept his camera turned off during video meetings. When he finally turned it on for one call, the face she saw seemed like that of a teenager.\n\nKillian was actually 24, just six years removed from performing “Hotel California” at his high school talent show at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School outside of Boston. (Killian, whose DOGE responsibilities also involved work at the Environmental Protection Agency, did not respond to a request for comment from ProPublica.)\n\nKowalski was exasperated by having to answer to such inexperience, even as so many of her colleagues were being pushed out the door by the Trump administration. She was not alone.\n\n“Many of us had actually believed in the marketed idea of genius technologists coming in to make things work better,” one senior SSA official said. But DOGE ended up being more interested, the official said, in “trying to prove that the Social Security Administration was entirely incompetent” than in suggesting improvements.\n\nEmployees at headquarters took their time walking past the glass-walled conference room where DOGE staffers had set up, glaring in at them as they worked among stacks of laptops that they used for assignments at different agencies. On a blog popular among SSA staffers, the mood in the comments section turned dark, with some anonymous posters identifying where in the building the “incel DOGE boys” were located and saying that “they are just warming up … just think what will come next.”\n\nDudek sensed the growing tension. He felt it, too. He’d been getting anonymous death threats mailed to his house. He decided to move the DOGE operatives to a more secluded area of the campus and assigned an armed security detail to protect them.\n\nDuring his first month as commissioner, Dudek ran his executive meetings in bombastic fashion, as if he were Trump on “The Apprentice.” And he sent out insulting full-staff emails pressuring career employees to retire. (Some 5,500 have left, with 1,500 more expected to follow.)\n\nDudek says this behavior stemmed partly from being in over his head, amazed by who he was suddenly answering to. “When the president of the United States asks you to do stuff,” he said, “you get caught up.”\n\nBut he also claims he was just performing a role. “Early on, I put on a persona of a yeller,” Dudek said. (Multiple longtime colleagues and friends noticed the change, they told ProPublica. As one put it, “There’s Lee, and then there’s Leland-performingly-Dudek.”)\n\nThis, he hoped, would convince the White House and DOGE of his commitment, which could in turn give him credibility as he kept trying to push them toward the real issues at Social Security.\n\nBut the Trump administration kept having other plans. Its demands usually came through Coulter, the DOGE lead with the Harvard and hedge fund background, who early on dropped by Dudek’s office unannounced multiple times a week, Dudek said.\n\n“I really think it would be helpful if you were to do this tomorrow,” Coulter would say to Dudek about eliminating an entire division of the SSA or cutting more staff, according to Dudek. To him, these suggestions felt like orders. If he responded, “I don’t know, let me think about it,” Coulter would call a few hours later on the encrypted-messaging app Signal to ask, “You really aren’t catching on, are you?” and “Do you know how many times I’ve defended you?”\n\n“I was supposed to get the message — and it would be ‘my own decision,’ so I’d be stuck with it,” Dudek said. “He can say he never told me to do anything.” (Coulter, who has been working for DOGE at NASA in recent months, did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nOne of Coulter’s suggestions involved the SSA’s Office of Transformation, which had been doing the seemingly DOGE-like work of developing an online application to replace many of the agency’s paper-based forms and in-person interviews. The office had been working with elderly, low-income and disabled people to see what most confused them about SSA processes and what would most help them if these were redesigned.\n\nBut instead of facilitating this effort at greater efficiency, Coulter told Dudek to close the office, according to Dudek, claiming it was wasteful. Agency staff joked that DOGE shut it down because its name included a word that began with “trans.”\n\nDudek and his colleagues sometimes attempted to co-opt DOGE’s obsessions in the hope that they could address a genuine problem at the agency. This strategy was not successful.\n\nSuch was the case with the issue of phone fraud. Knowing that the DOGErs would perk up at the mention of anything fraud-related, Dudek and other officials made a point of explaining that they’d been working on an initiative to block bots that had been calling the agency. The bots would impersonate beneficiaries, using dates of birth and other information that can be found on the internet, to try to change the beneficiaries’ bank-routing information and steal their benefits.\n\nIn 2024, Dudek had been on a team that spearheaded an effort to combat this type of fraud. The plans included running all phone-based requests for bank account changes against a Treasury Department database of suspicious accounts and analyzing such calls to verify whether they were being made from the vicinity of the address on file of the person purportedly calling.\n\nDOGE ignored the proposed solutions. Instead, the White House instructed Dudek to end all claims and direct-deposit transactions by phone. Beneficiaries would have to verify their own identities by using an often-confusing web portal or by traveling to a field office to do it in person. For millions of elderly or disabled people, these were daunting or impossible options.\n\nWhen this policy was rolled out at the end of March, beneficiaries panicked. Many flocked to field offices to preemptively provide proof of their identities even when they didn’t need to.\n\nBack at headquarters, in a weekly staff meeting, Dudek asked who could jump on the increasingly urgent task of making it easier to schedule field office appointments via the SSA website. “Well, Lee, you just fired that team,” one official answered, referring to the Office of Transformation. (Dudek said he asked this question on purpose to make sure DOGE heard the answer.)\n\nOver the course of six weeks under Dudek, the phone policy zigged and zagged a half dozen times — for example, the SSA adopted, then abandoned, a three-day waiting period to conduct an algorithmic fraud check on all calls — before finally ending up nearly where it began. Transactions could be carried out by phone again.\n\nThroughout this saga, Dudek was still getting calls from White House officials — most often from Katie Miller, DOGE’s spokesperson and the wife of Stephen Miller, one of Trump’s closest advisers. (Katie Miller went on to work for Musk before announcing plans to launch her own podcast. She did not respond to a request for comment.) Miller often called well into the evening, Dudek said, to chastise him about anything the press had reported that day that had caught the administration off guard.\n\nAs Dudek restored the phone policy to its pre-Trump version, Miller got angrier. “You changed the president’s policy,” she said, according to Dudek.\n\n“I’m like, ‘No, I’m still with the president’s policy,’” Dudek told Miller. But, if Social Security officials could implement the anti-fraud measures that he and his team had previously been planning, he said, they could “achieve the same end.” In that case, Dudek said, “we will do so and ease the friction point on the public.”\n\n“How dare you,” Miller said.\n\nIncreasingly dismayed, Dudek hatched a plan that seemed to embody his mix of good intentions, hubris and melodrama. He decided he would continue to play along with DOGE on the surface, in part so that Coulter and the other bigwigs would think he was still handling their business and thus spend less time at the agency. The younger DOGE team members, he said, were “easier to work with when their masters weren’t around.”\n\nBut behind the scenes, he began to undermine DOGE however he could. Sometimes he did this by making intemperate statements that he knew would find their way into the press and draw attention to what DOGE was asking him to do. “Have you ever worked with someone who’s manic-depressive?” he said of the Trump administration’s leadership in one meeting.\n\nOther times Dudek himself was the leaker. As commissioner, he was often an anonymous source for articles in The Washington Post and The New York Times. “If it was stupid stuff from the DOGE team, a lot of times I would go out to the press and immediately tattletale on myself so that it would blow up the next day,” Dudek said, adding that he did this in part to help Social Security advocates understand and bring attention to the growing crisis at the agency.\n\nRebecca Vallas, CEO of the nonprofit National Academy of Social Insurance, said she was in a one-on-one meeting with Dudek in March when he started getting calls from DOGE officials and the media. The calls were about his recent public comments claiming he might have to shut down the entire Social Security Administration if a federal judge continued to deny DOGE access to sensitive Social Security data. “He just let me sit there with the volume up high,” Vallas said.\n\nOn one of the calls, she said, someone told Dudek, “Elon loved that, but now it’s time to walk it back.” Afterward, Dudek told her, “I don’t know how we get out of this without hurting huge numbers of people. … I’m just trying to give advocates some ammunition.”\n\nDudek’s strategy was easier to pull off without DOGE catching on if it came off as the blundering of an amateur, he told ProPublica. In the most striking example, DOGE instructed Dudek to cancel two contracts that the SSA had with the state of Maine, according to Dudek and other SSA officials. The contracts, which all 50 states have long had versions of, allowed Maine to automatically report births and deaths to Social Security. Canceling them would impede government efficiency: Births and deaths in the state would take weeks or months longer to enter the federal system. That would likely cause benefits to continue to be sent to thousands of Mainers after they’ve died, exactly the kind of thing that Trump and Musk had been railing against.\n\nIt seemed clear to Dudek that he was being told to do this only because Trump was publicly feuding with Maine’s governor about transgender athletes. (The White House declined to comment on this episode.) So he decided to “write the hell out of” an email directing that the contracts be canceled. He did so in a way he thought would still earn him points with Trump and DOGE but that would, simultaneously, be so inflammatory that it would create a major storyline for reporters, advocates and Congress.\n\n“Please cancel the contracts,” Dudek’s email read. “While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child.” That last phrase referred to Maine’s governor, Janet Mills, the one Trump had been fighting with. (“Do I care about Janet Mills? No,” Dudek told ProPublica.)\n\nAs Dudek had hoped, the press attention he generated compelled him to do what he already wanted to do: reinstate the contracts. In a written apology, he explained that he was only belatedly realizing the potential harm of what he (alone) had done. “I screwed up,” he told reporters. “I’m new at this job.”\n\nOnce again, Miller called Dudek and excoriated him. “What the hell is going on?” she said.\n\n“This place leaks like a sieve,” he answered. “What can I tell you?”\n\nLooking back on his tenure, Dudek maintains that his three months working alongside DOGE were not as harmful as they could have been, especially compared with what happened this spring at other federal agencies, some of which were essentially vaporized. Social Security checks, he points out, are still going out the door.\n\nStill, the SSA is reduced in his wake, with thousands fewer staff members to process claims and improve systems. These departed employees were disproportionately experienced and knowledgeable; they were the ones able to get other jobs or to retire with a pension. They took a lot of know-how with them.\n\nAnd the emotional harm that DOGE caused to older people and to people with disabilities — worsened by Dudek’s confusing actions — lingers. Many of these people have had money taken out of their paychecks their entire careers to pay for something more than just retirement benefits: security. It’s a feeling that may now be lost to them forever.\n\nIndeed, DOGE and Dudek caused so much consternation about the stability of the system that hundreds of thousands of people have filed early for retirement in recent months, even though doing so is not financially wise in the long term. The SSA must now pay out more in benefits than expected, contrary to DOGE’s cost-saving mission.\n\nDudek’s sister back in Saginaw, Ana Dudek, relies on Social Security disability benefits. “I would talk to my brother when he was commissioner and be like, dude, the decisions you’re making are causing people to feel terror,” she said. “Terror is an apt descriptor.”\n\nDudek acknowledges much of this. “I’m not a cold, callous son of a bitch, I really do get it,” he said. “I’ll forever be associated with the pain of DOGE. … But so much went on in such a short amount of time. I tried to make the best decisions I could given the circumstances.”\n\nSince being dismissed from the agency in June, Dudek has been struggling to find another job. “My name is mud,” he said. “It is as if I no longer exist.”\n\nAs a former SSA colleague put it, Dudek’s story is “the story of a disposable pawn, and there’s lots of those under Trump. They just used him, and then they disposed of him.”\n\nThe White House, presented with extensive questions for this article, sent a one-paragraph statement disparaging ProPublica and Dudek. ProPublica’s story, White House spokesperson Davis Ingle said, “is largely based around the comments of a disgruntled former employee who openly admitted to leaking to the media, manipulating his colleagues, and repeatedly telling lies from his official position. On his last day as Acting Commissioner, Leland Dudek showered praise upon President Trump in an op-ed and touted the ‘real results’ of the Social Security Administration, but now that he’s bitter about being out of the top job — he’s singing a different tune.”\n\nDudek said the administration asked him to write the op-ed and then vetted it. Referring to the litany of extravagant praise that cabinet secretaries lavished on Trump recently, he said, “you saw the cabinet meeting.”\n\nBisignano, the Social Security commissioner, comes to the role with a very different professional background than Dudek (though, like Dudek, he has working-class roots, in his case in Brooklyn). Until this job, Bisignano, 66, spent his career in the private sector. He was a top executive in operations and technology at massive banks like Citigroup and JPMorganChase and went on to become CEO of the payment processor Fiserv.\n\nYet, like DOGE, he appears to have embraced the appearance of efficiency rather than efficiency itself. He has repeatedly told staff that Social Security should be run more like Amazon, with AI handling more customer interactions. But disability claims are more complicated than ordering toothpaste, according to SSA officials and experts, and Social Security’s customer base is older and more likely to have an intellectual disability than the average Amazon Prime member.\n\nBisignano has also fixated on how much time it takes to reach an agent on the SSA’s 800 number. In a July press release, he claimed that the average was down to six minutes, an 80% reduction from 2024. He achieved this in part by reassigning 1,000 field office employees to phone duty. That means initial calls are getting answered faster, but there are significantly fewer staff members available to handle complex, in-person cases. And “reaching an agent” turns out to mean speaking to a human being — or an AI bot. Internal SSA statistics obtained by ProPublica reveal that Bisignano’s estimate treats cases in which beneficiaries interact with a chatbot and opt for a callback as “zero-minute” waits, skewing the average. If you actually stay on the line, USA Today has found, it often takes over an hour to reach a live representative.\n\nIn its statement, the SSA reiterated that call wait times have dramatically improved and that “using technology on our national 800 number has enabled 90 percent of calls handled to be served via automated self-service options or convenient callbacks.”\n\nEven the latest phone fraud policy feels like a rerun from DOGE’s earlier season. In late July, Bisignano’s team quietly posted a document to the Office of Management and Budget website stating that 3.4 million more people would have to go into field offices to verify their identities instead of being able to do so by phone, starting Aug. 18. Days later, the SSA announced that this was actually optional.\n\nThe DOGE era may officially be over at the agency, but the approach, it seems, is the same. As one SSA official put it, Bisignano is “doing all the same fundamentally inefficient things, more efficiently.”","summary":"Reporting Highlights\n\n\nMissed Opportunity:  Some Social Security officials said they welcomed DOGE — the agency needs a technological overhaul — only to see DOGE ignore them and prioritize quick (often empty) wins.\nInternal Revolt:  Leland Dudek, the agency’s then acting chief, helped DOGE at first, then tried to resist when he saw what it was doing, Dudek said in 15 hours of candid interviews.\nDOGE Lives On:  Multiple former DOGErs have taken permanent roles at the Social Security Administration, and Senate-confirmed Commissioner Frank Bisignano has embraced its approach.

This is our live coverage.Donald Trump has popped up at the men’s final of the US Open. The President copped boos from the crowd, but also some cheers, particularly during the national anthem.Mr Trump didn’t watch the whole match – he walked out about an hour-and-a-half in – but the President returned to his seat shortly before it ended.There was some mild controversy, ahead of time, because the tournament asked broadcasters not to cut to Mr Trump between points and games.He was briefly shown after Carlos Alcaraz won the title, though. Surrounded by clapping people, he did not applaud, instead adjusting his pants and blazer while looking rather morose. Perhaps he was cheering for Jannik Sinner.Or maybe he was just bored.00:14XLearn MoreMorevideos\n\n ShareFacebookX/TwitterCopy URLCopied URL to clipboardSUBSCRIBER ONLYThis video is available for subscribers only.

Kennedy Jr.Mr Trump rewarded Mr Kennedy, a quite notorious anti-vaxxer and conspiracy theorist, with the job heading up America’s federal health system after he ended his independent presidential campaign last year and endorsed Mr Trump instead of Democrat Kamala Harris.Mr Kennedy’s appearance at a congressional hearing was often testy and bad-tempered, as various senators grilled him on his reorientation of the Health Department to make it more hostile to vaccines.“You look at that appearance before Congress and it just confirms what all of us around this table have known for decades: Robert F. Kennedy Jr is a foolish man, full of foolish, vapid ideas,” former New Jersey governor Chris Christie, a Republican and one-time ally of Mr Trump, said on the ABC program This Week today.He lamented that a “wholly unqualified man” had been put in charge “of 25 per cent of government spending”.“The President did this. He knows. The President’s smart enough to know RFK Jr doesn’t belong in that job,” said Mr Christie.“But after he won, he wanted to show everybody, ‘I can do whatever I want to do, because this Senate will be compliant no matter what I do, and I’ll put the greatest vaccine and public health denier of the last 20 years in charge of public health in America.’“It’s a human middle finger to everybody who opposed him.”37 minutes ago HIGHLIGHT Democratic presidential contender rules himself outSamuel ClenchOne of the names being floated as a potential presidential nominee for the Democrats in 2028, Maryland Governor Wes Moore, has explicitly ruled himself out.We’ll see whether that commitment holds two or three years from now. He wouldn’t be the first to reject the idea, only to turn around and enthusiastically pursue it shortly afterwards.But Mr Moore told the NBC program Meet the Press that he harboured no such ambitions.“Do you rule out a run for president, Governor?” host Kristen Welker asked him. More ⌄7:07 PMSep 07, 2025 HIGHLIGHT 'Be quiet': Trump gets tetchy with reporterSamuel ClenchA reporter has asked Donald Trump about this social media post from the weekend.Very normal behaviour. The context here is that Mr Trump has threatened to send the National Guard into Chicago to help law enforcement combat crime, a legally dubious move, and one local leaders say they don’t want.Also, he just signed an executive order which seeks to rename America’s Department of Defence the Department of War, which was the name of its precursor until the late 1940s.“Are you trying to go to war with Chicago?” a reporter asked Mr Trump today, as he departed the White House to watch the tennis.

He copped boos from the crowd, but also some cheers, particularly during the national anthem.Mr Trump didn’t watch the whole match – he walked out about an hour-and-a-half in – but the President returned to his seat shortly before it ended.There was some mild controversy, ahead of time, because the tournament asked broadcasters not to cut to Mr Trump between points and games. For … some reason? I can tell you there was no hesitation at all about showing other celebrities in the crowd at every available opportunity.

Speculation has swirled that Moore would run for president, and the Maryland governor is up for reelection in 2026. When asked if Moore intends to serve a full term if reelected, he said yes. When Welker pressed if he would not be running for president, Moore ruled out a presidential run in the next election. \"Yes, I'm going to be serving a full term. I'm excited about re-election. I'm exciting about what I'm gonna be able to do for the people of Maryland,\" Moore said. KAMALA HARRIS' MAJOR CALIFORNIA ANNOUNCEMENT TRIGGERS CIRCULAR DEM FIRING SQUAD \"Do you rule out a run for president, governor?\" Welker shot back. \"Yeah, I'm not running for president,\" Moore replied. \"You rule it out? Yes. You completely rule it out?\" Welker asked. Moore proceeded to list his accomplishments as governor and said he looks forward to continuing to work leading Maryland.

We've had amongst the fastest drops in violent crime anywhere in the United States of America. Our population is growing, Maryland is moving, and so I'm really excited about going back in front of the people of my state and asking for another term,\" Moore said. Maryland’s unemployment rate was 3.4% as of July 2025, slightly higher than the previous month, but tied for 14th lowest among all 50 states. Baltimore saw 201 homicides in 2024, according to police data. Its homicide rate represented a ten-year low. However, Maryland’s violent crime rate was 17.1% higher than the national average. Moore was just one of several names speculated to run for the Democratic nomination in 2028, other prominent Democrats thought to be potential candidates include Illinois Gov. J.B.

He hopped between parties, voted irregularly, and never truly committed to a single ideology. No surprise, then, that Americans weren’t sure what box to put him in.\n\nFour years in the White House changed that. And since his return to the White House earlier this year, Trump has doubled down on a hard-right agenda—rolling back protections for LGBTQ+ people, cutting deals that benefit the wealthy, dismantling DEI initiatives, and pushing policies that are both anti-democratic and anti-Democratic. Whatever ambiguity existed a decade ago is long gone.\n\nRelated | Trump's just fine with queer kids killing themselves\n\nAnd yet, a sizable share of Republicans still see Trump very differently. A late August YouGov poll shows just how off the mark GOP voters are about his record. According to the survey, 35% of Republicans think Trump supports raising the minimum wage, 45% believe he backs stronger worker protections, 26% say he favors higher corporate taxes, and just 29% think he’d raise taxes on the wealthy.\n\nIn reality, Trump’s record runs the other way. His administration moved to strip minimum wage and overtime protections from 3.7 million home-care and domestic workers. He killed a plan to stop employers from paying disabled workers less than the $7.25-an-hour federal minimum wage. And his sweeping tax and budget plan—officially called the The One Big Beautiful Bill Act—is expected to deliver the largest transfer of wealth from working-class Americans to the ultrawealthy in U.S. history. \n\nThe disconnect is striking. Democrats and independents are much more accurate in gauging Trump’s positions. The same YouGov poll found only 9% of Democrats and 17% of independents believe Trump supports stronger worker protections. Just 10% of Democrats and 18% of independents think he favors raising the minimum wage.\n\nIn other words, Democrats and independents generally see Trump for who he is. Republicans, not so much.\n\nSo why the misperception? Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University, said it comes down to polarization and “expressive bias.” \n\n“I imagine what’s happening among many Republicans is that they start with the notion that they are supporters of Trump,” Reeher told Daily Kos. “Then, when they are asked what he wants to do in those specific policy areas, they choose what they would like to see happen, and assume that’s also what Trump wants to do, because they support Trump.” \n\nThat’s the polarization effect at work.\n\nExpressive bias takes it further. Popular policies—like raising the minimum wage or taxing corporations—are often attributed to Trump by Republicans who want to reinforce their support. \n\n“Some of them may recognize that raising the minimum wage, improving worker conditions, and raising the tax on corporations are popular positions, and then assert that Trump wants to do those things—again because they support Trump and want to show that support, rather than stating that Trump wants to do something less popular,” Reeher said.\n\nReeher added that some Republicans may be connecting dots that don’t actually line up. For example, seeing Trump’s tough talk on immigration or manufacturing as proof that he wants to raise wages.\n\n“Some voters seem to translate Trump’s rhetoric into policies he doesn’t actually support—like assuming support for blue-collar workers means raising the minimum wage, or that calling out corporations means taxing them,” Reeher said.\n\nRelated | Trump’s tariffs hit his blue-collar backers where it hurts\n\nThis isn’t entirely new. Democrats were privately fuming about it during the 2024 campaign. A New York Times/Siena College survey that September found just under one-in-three (32%) likely voters thought Trump was “too conservative,” compared with 47% who said former Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris was “too liberal.” It was a striking data point, one that helped reinforce the narrative that Trump was a more moderate option than Harris—even as his actual record said otherwise.\n\nWe saw shades of the same phenomenon in 2021, when millions of Americans insisted the 2020 election was “stolen.” For many, the claim was less about genuine belief in voter fraud and more about signaling allegiance to Trump. \n\nAs Reeher put it, this kind of bias isn’t necessarily about facts—it’s about expressing loyalty.\n\nFraming matters too. People like the idea of “worker protections” in theory, but they may not connect that principle to actual policies. Moves like weakening OSHA rules, loosening child labor restrictions, or undermining wage standards don’t sound like “pro-worker” positions when spelled out plainly. It’s easier for supporters to say Trump is “for workers” in the abstract, even when his policies cut against them in practice. \n\nBy contrast, Democrats’ policy positions are far less muddled in the public mind. The same YouGov survey found adults across the political spectrum generally understood where Democrats stand: 86% of Democrats, 65% of independents, and 63% of Republicans knew that Democrats want to increase the minimum wage. Similar majorities across partisan groups also knew Democrats want to raise taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Even if voters don’t always like Democrats’ positions, they tend to know what they are.\n\nThat’s what makes Republicans’ perception of Trump so revealing. If GOP voters truly believe he’s more liberal than he is, it suggests two things: Either Republicans want policies like higher wages and stronger worker protections but don’t realize Trump opposes them, or they don’t know enough about his record to notice the gap between rhetoric and reality.\n\n“Many polls over recent decades have suggested that the public is generally supportive of more liberal policies when those policies are described in objective ways,” Reeher said. “Whether that means Republicans should adopt those policies is a more complicated question—historically, they have been arguing for a more conservative approach.”\n\nThe bigger issue here is a lack of political literacy. Most voters don’t follow the fine print of economic or labor policy closely enough to see where the parties really split. That gap makes it easy for misperceptions to take hold—and for partisan loyalty and Trump’s branding to fill in the blanks. \n\nJohn Mark Hansen, a professor of political science at the University of Chicago, told Daily Kos that with unions representing just 6% of private-sector workers, very few Americans hear consistently pro-worker messaging outside of partisan politics. Into that void, Trump has filled the space with performative stunts that sound worker-friendly. But when it comes to actual policy, his record tells a different story. \n\n“Most people have very limited information about policies, particularly in areas that don’t affect them,” Hansen said. “Partisans tend to fall back on party talking points when they don’t know or care much. How else did a chest-thumping party of Russia haters come to champion Putin as America’s best friend?”\n\nIn the end, the polling says less about Trump’s policies than about how voters see themselves reflected in him. What this survey and other surveys suggest is that Trump supporters project their own preferences onto him—even when those preferences are at odds with his actual record. That gap between perception and reality isn’t just a quirk of polling—it’s a feature of today’s politics: Facts often take a back seat to identity.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Fresh polling from the Wall Street Journal–NORC shows Americans sinking deeper into economic gloom. Only 25% say they have a good chance of improving their standard of living—the lowest share since the survey began in 1987. Nearly eight in 10 (78%) doubt the next generation will be better off, and close to 70% say the American dream either never existed or no longer does, the most skepticism recorded in 15 years. The discontent cuts broadly across gender, age, education, and income. Still, the outlook isn’t entirely bleak. Forty-four percent now describe the economy as excellent or good, an uptick from 38% a year ago. Yet most adults—56%—continue to rate conditions as poor, underscoring how Trump’s economic policies are weighing on public sentiment.\n\n Over the holiday weekend, rumors circulated that Trump had died—claims the president himself said earlier this week he had heard nothing about. While Trump remains very much alive, his health has come under scrutiny after he was seen with bruising on the back of his right hand and swelling around his ankles. Ongoing questions about his age and fitness have led some voters to wonder if he’s fully capable of handling the job as president. A YouGov poll found that 59% of adults believe Trump’s health and age affect his ability to do the job, at least somewhat, while about a quarter (26%) say it hasn’t affected him at all. As expected, opinions vary sharply along party lines, with Republicans much less likely to see an impact. Still, if a transition were necessary, most GOP voters trust Vice President JD Vance: 75% of Republicans told YouGov that he is qualified to take over, compared with just 10% of Democrats.\n\n Trump and his allies have been blunt about wanting women—especially white women—to have more kids. And new Gallup polling shows that even with falling birth rates, Americans still like the idea of bigger families. A plurality now says the “ideal” family size is two or three children—down from three or four back in 1935—but the point is clear: People still want families, despite Republican talking points suggesting otherwise.\n\nAs of midday Friday, 44.3% of the Americans approved of Trump, while 51.3% disapproved—a net approval rating of -6.9 points, after rounding, according to election analyst Nate Silver’s polling average.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n\n\n\nBack in June 2015, it wasn’t easy to pin down President Donald Trump’s politics. \n\n\n\nThe celebrity businessman spent most of his public life discussing money, rather than policy.

He drew mixed cheers and boos.\n\nArthur Ashe stadium was only partially full, and Mr. Trump’s waves weren’t announced beforehand. They were also brief enough so that some of those in attendance didn’t notice them. \n\nThe President attended as a guest of Rolex despite imposing steep tariffs on the Swiss watchmaker’s home country, and organisers were seeking to keep booing of him from being seen on the TV broadcast. \n\nMr. Trump has built the bulk of his second term’s domestic travel around attending major sports events rather than hitting the road to make policy announcements or address the kind of large rallies he so relished as a candidate. \n\nBecause of extra security screening, the final between second-seeded Carlos Alcaraz, a 22-year-old Spaniard, and No. 1 seed and defending champion Jannik Sinner, 24, of Italy, was pushed back half an hour — meaning Mr. Trump arrived more than 45 minutes before the new start time. \n\nThe President was watching from Rolex’s suite, and his acceptance of Rolex’s invitation came mere weeks after the Trump administration imposed a whopping 39% tariff on Swiss products. \n\nThe levy is more than 2 1/2 times higher than the one the Mr. Trump administration agreed to for European Union goods exported to the U.S. and nearly four times higher than on British exports to the U.S. It has raised questions about Switzerland’s ability to compete with the 27-member bloc that it neighbours. \n\nThe White House declined to comment on Mr. Trump accepting a corporate client’s invitation at the tournament, but the President has had few qualms about blurring lines between political and foreign policy decisions and efforts to boost the profits of his family business. \n\nThat includes tirelessly promoting cryptocurrency interests and luxury golf properties around the country and the world that bear his name. He announced on Friday (September 5, 2025) that the U.S. will use its turn hosting the Group of 20 summit in December 2026 to stage the sweeping event at Trump National Doral in South Florida. \n\nAny negative reaction to Mr. Trump’s presence won’t be shown on ABC’s national telecast, per standard policy, the U.S. Tennis Association says. “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions,” the organisation said in a statement. \n\nAs heavy rains began mostly clearing, and throngs of fans arrived for the match, no major street protests against the president could be seen from the tournament’s main stadium. Attendees also steered clear of wearing any of the president’s signature “Make America Great Again” caps, though. \n\nA 58-year tennis fan originally from Turin, Italy, came from her home in the Boston area to watch the final and said that when she bought a U.S. Open cap, she went with a fuchsia-hued one so it wouldn’t be mistaken for the signature darker colour of MAGA hats. “I was careful not to get the red one,” said the fan, who declined to give her name because of her employer’s rules about being publicly quoted. \n\nAttending with Mr. Trump were White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special administration envoy Steve Witkoff and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. \n\nElsewhere in the crowd were a slew of celebrities — some of whom publicly backed then-Vice President Kamala Harris during last year’s election against Mr. Trump. Among them were Pink, Bruce Springsteen, Shonda Rhimes, Michael J. Fox, Sting, Shaggy, Ben Stiller and Courtney Cox. \n\nMr. Trump came back to the press cabin on Air Force One during the flight to New York to note that the plane would be flying over Ashe stadium but didn’t offer any further comment. \n\nMr. Trump was once a U.S. Open mainstay but hasn’t attended since he was loudly booed at a quarterfinals match in September 2015, months after launching his first presidential campaign. \n\nThe Mr. Trump Organisation once controlled its own U.S. Open suite, which was adjacent to the stadium’s television broadcasting booth, but suspended it in 2017, during the first year of Mr. Trump’s first term. The family business is now being run by Mr. Trump’s sons with their father back in the White House. \n\nMr. Trump was born in Queens, home of the U.S. Open, and for decades was a New York-area real estate mogul and, later, a reality TV star. Attending the tournament before he was a politician, he usually sat in the suite’s balcony during night matches and was frequently shown on the arena’s video screens. \n\nIn recent years, however, including between his presidential terms, Mr. Trump primarily lived at his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago. \n\nAlcaraz said before the final that having Mr. Trump on-hand would be a privilege and “great for tennis,” but also suggested that such sentiment went for any president watching from the stands. “I don’t want myself to be nervous because of it,” he said. \n\nThe President has also frequently attended sporting events — where the roar of the crowd sometimes features people booing him while others cheer him. \n\nSince returning to the White House in January and prior to Sunday’s (September 7, 2025) U.S. Open swing, Mr. Trump went to the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the Daytona 500, as well as UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia and the FIFA Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey. \n\nHaving a sitting president attend the U.S. Open hasn’t happened since Bill Clinton went to the 2000 tournament, though former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, attended the event’s opening night in 2023.","summary":"The President was watching from Rolex’s suite, and his acceptance of Rolex’s invitation came mere weeks after the Trump administration imposed a whopping 39% tariff on Swiss products","url":"https://www.thehindu.com/news/international/trump-attends-us-open-as-rolexs-guest-despite-swiss-tariffs/article70023870.ece","image":"https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/bykq3o/article70023873.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/2025-09-07T214923Z_549807563_UP1EL971O9GNA_RTRMADP_3_TENNIS-USOPEN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:34:49","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.022},{"id":358343744,"title":"Jack Schlossberg, grandson of JFK, takes first step toward running for Congress","text":"Jack Schlossberg, a writer and political commentator who also happens to be the grandson of late president John F. Kennedy, announced Sunday that he has formed an exploratory committee for a potential congressional run. \n\nIn his first step toward a formal political career, Schlossberg, 32, said in a brief X post that he had formed the group, which will likely determine whether or not Schlossberg could successfully run to replace New York Representative Jerry Nadler. \n\nNadler, a Democrat, represents New York City’s 12th district, which includes Midtown and Uptown Manhattan. He announced last week he would not seek re-election after more than three decades in Congress.\n\nSchlossberg, a native New Yorker, became national news last year when he used his social media influence to advocate for former vice president Kamala Harris’s election campaign. He also became a political correspondent for Vogue during that time, and currently hosts a political commentary show on YouTube.\n\nThe 32-year-old, who was educated at Yale and Harvard, belongs to one of the country’s most famous political dynasties, the Kennedys. His mother is Caroline Kennedy, a former ambassador and Democratic activist. She is the only surviving child of JFK.\n\nSchlossberg’s cousin first-removed is Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whom he has repeatedly criticized on social media for spreading health misinformation.\n\nSchlossberg has been trolling RFK Jr. online, launching unsubstantiated claims at him, such as accusing the Trump Cabinet secretary of being a “Russian spy.”\n\nBut the political “nepo baby” appears keen to enter the family business by making a formal bid to become an elected representative. \n\nTypically, the first step in announcing a campaign is forming an exploratory committee, which allows potential candidates to raise money and hire staff without having to report activity to the Federal Election Commission. \n\nExploratory committees, also known as “testing the waters” committees, give candidates more time before making a formal campaign announcement. \n\nSchlossberg is already well known in Democratic circles, thanks to his family’s famous name. But his exploratory committee announcement puts him in a crowded field of many potential Nadler successors.\n\nNew York Assembly member Micah Lasher, largely considered Nadler’s heir, has filed a formal campaign with the FEC. \n\nLiam Elkind, a 26-year-old co-founder of Invisible Hands – a nonprofit dedicated to delivering food or medicine to those unable to acquire it themselves -- has also announced he would seek to replace Nadler.\n\nNadler himself has brushed off Schlossberg as an unserious candidate. \n\n“There’s nothing particularly good or bad about a Kennedy holding my seat, but the Kennedy, unlike Schlossberg, should be somebody with a record of public service, a record of public accomplishment, and he doesn’t have one,” Nadler told CNN.","summary":"Schlossberg has made a name for himself, mostly online, by serving as a political correspondent for Vogue and attacking his relative, Health Secretary RFK Jr.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jack-schlossberg-jfk-election-congress-b2821911.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/09/07/21/53/GettyImages-2172637552.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/alNlnU8M-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-09-07 22:09:14","author":"Ariana Baio","authors":["Ariana Baio"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.435},{"id":358339526,"title":"Trump’s US Open visit sparks boos and long security queues","text":"US President Donald Trump attended the US Open on Sunday and was booed by the crowd at the men’s final, which was delayed due to the extra security associated with his visit.\nThe final still featured long queues of fans waiting to get in when play began.\nWearing a suit and red tie, Trump briefly emerged from his suite about 45 minutes before the match started and heard a mix of boos and cheers from an Arthur Ashe Stadium, which was still mostly empty.\nNo announcement preceded his appearance and it was brief enough that some in the crowd missed it.\nTrump appeared again to more boos before the National Anthem.

No announcement proceeded his appearance, and it was brief enough that some in the crowd missed it.\n\nTrump appeared again to more boos before the National Anthem. Standing in salute, the president was shown briefly on the arena’s big screens during the anthem, and offered a smirk that briefly made the boos louder. \n\nWhen the anthem was over, the Republican pointed to a small group of supporters seated nearby, then sat on the suite’s balcony to watch the match intently. He mostly didn’t applaud, even following major points that energized the rest of the crowd as Spain’s Carlos Alcaraz took on the No. 1 seed and the tournament’s defending champion, Jannik Sinner of Italy. \n\nTrump was shown on the big screen again after the first set ended, and elicited a roar of louder boos and some piercing whistles. He raised his left fist in salute as the noise continued in the stadium, which with a capacity of 24,000 is one of the largest in tennis. Trump later moved back inside the suite where he was seen seated at a table with family members.\n\nOrganizers pushed the start of the match back half an hour to give people more time to pass through enhanced screening checkpoints reminiscent of security at airports. Still, thousands of increasingly frustrated fans remained in line outside as the match got underway. Many seats, especially those in upper rows, stayed empty for nearly an hour.\n\nThe Secret Service issued a statement saying that protecting Trump “required a comprehensive effort” and noting that it “may have contributed to delays for attendees.” \n\n“We sincerely thank every fan for their patience and understanding,” it said. \n\nTrump attended the final as a guest of Rolex, despite imposing steep tariffs on the Swiss watchmaker’s home country. The U.S. Tennis Association also tried to limit negative reaction to Trump’s attendance being shown on ABC’s national telecast, saying in a statement before play began: “We regularly ask our broadcasters to refrain from showcasing off-court disruptions.” \n\nThe reactions to Trump didn’t ultimately constitute major disruptions, though. \n\nGoing to the U.S. Open was the latest example of Trump having built the bulk of his second term’s domestic travel around attending major sports events rather than hitting the road to make policy announcements or address the kind of large rallies he so relished as a candidate.\n\nSince returning to the White House in January and prior to Sunday’s U.S Open swing, Trump has gone to the Super Bowl in New Orleans and the Daytona 500, as well as UFC fights in Miami and Newark, New Jersey, the NCAA wrestling championships in Philadelphia and the FIFA Club World Cup final in East Rutherford, New Jersey. Some of those crowds cheered him, but people booed him at other events. \n\nThe president accepted Rolex’s invitation despite his administration imposing a whopping 39% tariff on Swiss products. That’s more than 2 1/2 times higher than levies on European Union goods exported to the U.S. and nearly four times higher than on British exports to the U.S. \n\nThe White House declined to comment on Trump accepting a corporate client’s invitation at the tournament, but the president has had few qualms about blurring lines between political and foreign policy decisions and efforts to boost the profits of his family business. He’s tirelessly promoted his cryptocurrency interests and luxury golf properties, and even announced that the U.S. will host the Group of 20 summit in December 2026 at his Doral golf resort in Florida. \n\nNo major street protests against Trump could be seen from the tournament’s main stadium on Sunday. But attendees also steered clear of wearing any of the the Republican’s signature “Make America Great Again” caps. \n\nA 58-year-old tennis fan originally from Turin, Italy, came from her home in the Boston area to watch the final and said that when she bought a U.S. Open cap, she went with a fuchsia-hued one so it wouldn’t be mistaken for the signature darker color of MAGA hats. \n\n“I was careful not to get the red one,” said the fan, who declined to give her name because of her employer’s rules about being publicly quoted.\n\nAmong those attending with Trump were White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, special envoy Steve Witkoff and Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff. Trump spent various portions of the match engaged in conversation with many of those around him.\n\nElsewhere in the crowd were a slew of celebrities — some of whom publicly backed then-Vice President Kamala Harris during last year’s election. Among them were Pink, Bruce Springsteen and Shonda Rhimes. In pre-match interviews shown on large stadium screens with the likes of Martha Stewart and Jon Hamm, the questions asked stuck to tennis and pop culture — not Trump and politics. \n\nThe president nonetheless was excited enough about his trip to tell reporters on Air Force One during the flight to New York when the plane flew over Ashe stadium — though the covered roof kept those inside from reacting. \n\nTrump was once a U.S. Open mainstay, but hadn’t attended since he was booed at a quarterfinals match in September 2015, months after launching his first presidential campaign. \n\nThe Trump Organization once controlled its own U.S. Open suite, which was adjacent to the stadium’s television broadcasting booth, but suspended it in 2017, during the first year of Trump’s first term. The family business is now being run by Trump’s sons with their father back in the White House. \n\nTrump was born in Queens, home of the U.S. Open, and for decades was a New York-area real estate mogul and, later, a reality TV star. Attending the tournament before he was a politician, he usually sat in his company’s suite’s balcony during night matches and was frequently shown on the arena’s video screens.\n\nWill Weissert, The Associated Press","summary":"NEW YORK (AP) — President Donald Trump was loudly booed at the men&#8217;s final of the U.S. Open on Sunday, where extra security caused by his visit led to lines long enough that many people missed the start of play, even after organizers delayed it.
