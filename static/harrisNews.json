The duo arrived to cheers in the band room at Liberty County High School, where students were seated with their instruments and with members of the football team and cheerleaders also present. “Our country is counting on you, all of you,” Harris told them. “You are leaders.” “Your generation … is what is going to propel us into the next era,” she said. Harris and Walz are riding a bus through southern Georgia, home to some of its largest Black populations and where the campaign has added staff and opened field offices. Liberty County, with a population of around 65,000, is about 40% Black and voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden in 2020. The 2024 race has changed dramatically since Harris became her party’s candidate, and she hopes to galvanize Black voters who make up about one-third of Georgia’s electorate and will be crucial in the effort to win the state. Before President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid last month and endorsed Vice President Harris, opinion polls showed Republican candidate Donald Trump with a clear lead in Georgia, and that some Black voters were disillusioned with Democrats. Since then, however, Harris has steadily gained ground in national polls and has been boosted by well over $500 million in donations. The latest polls compiled by FiveThirtyEight show Harris just behind Trump, 46.0% to 46.6% in Georgia, compared with about a 5 percentage point lead for Trump before Harris entered the race on July 21. A new Reuters/Ipsos poll on Tuesday showed that Harris has eroded Trump’s advantage on the economy and crime. Before the 2020 race, Georgia last backed a Democrat for president in 1992. If elected, Harris will be the first female president in U.S. history. As a Black and South Asian woman, she is seeking to shore up support for Democrats among Black voters and motivate new groups of voters. In Boston earlier on Wednesday, Walz made a pitch to the 350,000-member International Association of Firefighters, which has not joined other large unions in endorsing Harris. She has pledged support for labor rights and cutting taxes for the middle class, he said, while Trump blocked overtime benefits and opposed efforts to raise the minimum wage. “We’re going to need you with us to win that fight,” Walz said. “Sisters and brothers in labor, it’s time for you to step up to the plate.” Harris was expected to focus on the economy and abortion rights during the Georgia trip, including a pledge to lower consumer costs, a campaign official said. The tour will culminate with a Harris rally in the Savannah area on Thursday. It is Harris’ second Georgia trip since she became the Democratic candidate. A rally in Atlanta earlier this month featured hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion and drew more than 10,000 people. Harris, 59, pledged then that Democrats will win the state, which has 16 Electoral College votes and is one of several swing states that can lean either to Republicans or Democrats. Democrats won it by less than 12,000 votes in 2020. Republicans have dramatically ramped up spending in Georgia and the Republican-controlled state election board added a new rule that voting rights advocates say could delay certification of the vote in November. Trump, 78, said in a social media post last week that winning Georgia “is so important to the success of our Party, and most importantly, our Country.” He is expected to campaign in the state several more times before Election Day on Nov. 5.","summary":"HINESVILLE, Georgia >> Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris and her running mate Tim Walz campaigned together on Wednesday in Georgia, a state that Democrats narrowly won in 2020 and could play a decisive role in this year&#8217;s election, with an appeal to young voters.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/28/breaking-news/harris-and-walz-start-georgia-bus-tour-as-democrats-hopes-rise/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_2024-08-29T000151Z_995265912_RC2BP9AGAZJN_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-HARRIS.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 00:20:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.133},{"id":255148142,"title":"The Trump administration diminishes significance of incident in Arlington to reduce political consequences","text":"WASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump’s campaign is playing down reports of an altercation during his visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, a move that signals its concern about potential political fallout from the incident. “A nameless bureaucrat at Arlington whose job it is to preserve the dignity of the cemetery is doing the complete opposite in trying to make what was a very solemn and respectful event into something it was not,” said Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita, a retired Marine who was with Trump at the cemetery Monday. Trump has long portrayed himself as a champion of service members and veterans — an image bolstered by participants in Monday’s ceremony. But he has also created a pattern of disparaging service members that has led even some former aides to question the authenticity of his support for the military. The latest episode threatens to blunt his attacks on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over a 2021 terrorist assault at the so-called Abbey Gate of the Kabul airport, which killed 13 American service members. It was the third anniversary of the bombings, which occurred during the harried U.S. exit from Afghanistan, that took Trump to the Arlington burial ground, in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, on Monday. He laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to honor those who died in the bombings and then moved to Section 60, an area reserved for participants in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Trump was joined at both sites by family members of the men and women killed at Abbey Gate. The family members invited him to participate in the commemoration, and they wanted the moment to be documented, according to two people who were present. “I gave my permission,” Kelly Barnett, the mother of Marine Staff Sgt. Darin “Taylor” Hoover, told NBC News. “I wanted the memories. I wanted to make sure that my family at home — I have a huge family — I wanted to make sure that they were involved with it, as well, and they could see it and feel it, have the experience that we had. And so I said, yeah, in no uncertain terms, I was OK with it.” Trump posed for a photograph beside Hoover’s grave, smiling and giving a thumbs-up gesture in a shot that included the headstones of other service members who were not part of Monday’s ceremony. A federal regulation admonishes that memorial services at Army cemeteries “will not include partisan political activities.” NPR first reported Tuesday that two Trump campaign staffers had a confrontation with a cemetery official who tried to prevent them from filming. “We can confirm there was an incident, and a report was filed,” the cemetery said in a statement. Whatever happened, Barnett and another participant — who asked to remain anonymous without authorization to speak for the families — said they noticed nothing amiss. “We didn’t even hear about it until the next day,” the second participant said, who did not believe Trump’s participation amounted to campaign activity. “It wasn’t politicized,” this person said. Trump posted video that included clips from Monday’s ceremony to his TikTok account. In the video, he blamed Biden and Harris for the deaths at the Kabul airport. Trump, like most Republican presidential candidates in recent decades, has won the majority of voters who have served in the military, according to exit polls. But his edge was smaller in his defeat in 2020 — 54% to 44% — than when he won that part of the electorate 61% to 34% in taking the presidency in 2016. His aides have publicly dismissed the report of a physical interaction at the cemetery and accused Democrats of ignoring the anniversary, which is the most poignant reminder of a withdrawal that was politically damaging to Biden. “They’re trying to muddle the fact that there was only one commander in chief in Arlington on Aug. 26,” LaCivita said. He noted that Biden was on vacation and that Harris did not visit Arlington on the anniversary. Both of them issued statements. Neither Trump nor Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, served in uniform. Their running mates, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., did. Harris’ campaign declined to comment on the report of an altercation at Arlington, but its communications director, Michael Tyler, addressed it in a CNN interview Wednesday. “Frankly, I think this episode is pretty sad when it’s all said and done,” Tyler said. “Listen, this is what we’ve come to expect from Donald Trump and his team. Donald Trump is a person who wants to make everything all about Donald Trump. He’s also somebody who has a history of demeaning and degrading military service members, those who have given the ultimate sacrifice.” A Trump adviser who spoke with NBC News pointed to a statement signed by five Gold Star family members and two Purple Heart recipients who were with Trump on Monday defending him amid the firestorm. They said in the statement that they gave approval for Trump’s videographer and photographer to capture those moments so they could “cherish these memories forever.” “Everything involved in the day was at their invitation,” this person said. “It wasn’t a campaign event. It was an event done by the families of these people, and they invited the commander-in-chief who has consistently demonstrated strong and unwavering support for them and all service members and their families.” This person said that Trump was “grateful” for the invitation and that he would show “how committed he is when he’s back in the White House to ensure that the people who manufactured that insane and disastrous withdrawal are held accountable for it.” The Trump campaign’s handling of the episode after details leaked to the media raised some eyebrows among Republicans, particularly a statement in which communications director Steven Cheung said “an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony.” A Republican operative, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the statement “so unprofessional.” A Trump ally, meanwhile, said the “behavior” outlined at the cemetery was “really out of character” for the campaign. For years, Trump has faced accusations of showing disrespect to veterans and service members. Early this year, he mocked the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for being unable to raise his arms because of injuries he sustained as a prisoner of war. In 2015, he also said McCain was not a “war hero” because “he was captured.” “I like people that weren’t captured,” he said at the time. McCain, a veteran of the Vietnam War, gained national recognition for his time as a prisoner of war in the infamous “Hanoi Hilton,” where he was tortured. This cycle, Trump also questioned why Nikki Haley’s husband was not with her on the campaign trail during the Republican primaries. Maj. Michael Haley was serving overseas at the time. Just this month, Trump described the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is a civilian honor, as “much better” than the Medal of Honor, a military honor, because recipients of the latter are often deceased or severely injured. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly said last year his former boss denigrated veterans and service members as “suckers” and “losers,” confirming remarks that were published in The Atlantic years earlier. Trump has vehemently and repeatedly denied making such comments. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat and Army veteran, pointed to Trump’s comments about the Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, adding that the episode at Arlington National Cemetery appeared to be a “continuation of something that I just find really problematic.” “There is this attacking of those with military service and this increasing politicization and disrespect for those who have chosen to serve this country,” he said, adding that he still wanted to learn more details about what happened between Trump’s staff and the cemetery official. At their convention last week, Democrats took Trump to task over military issues, emphasizing a theme of patriotism. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that Trump “does not understand the service and sacrifice of our military” and that he was the only president since World War II who has not “honored our veterans and their sacrifices.” But for Republicans, the episode served to further shine a light on what they see as one of the Biden administration’s biggest failings in Afghanistan, a key piece of their message on global instability over the past four years. “The veterans that I talk to feel disrespected and disappointed, certainly at their commander in chief, in the direction of the United States militarily,” Pennsylvania state Rep. Rob Mercuri, a veteran and congressional candidate in the 17th District, which is a swing district with a large veteran population. “The only thing I would say about President Trump is that his plan is to project strength. My view is that the Reagan Doctrine of peace through strength is really important to come back to.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — Former President Donald Trump&#8217;s campaign is playing down reports of&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Trump administration diminishes significance of incident in Arlington to reduce political consequences first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/the-trump-administration-diminishes-significance-of-incident-in-arlington-to-reduce-political-consequences/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-08/240827-donald-trump-arlington-se-1012p-fb8203.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-29 00:18:12","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":255148258,"title":"Harris and Trump locked in tight races in four key Sun Belt swing states, new poll shows ","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are within two percentage points of each other in four swing states that could decide the 2024 race, a poll released Wednesday showed. The Fox News survey found Harris holding slim leads in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada; and Trump topping Harris by a razor-thin margin in North Carolina. In Arizona, Harris garnered 50% support to Trump’s 49% backing. In both Georgia and Nevada, the vice president held a 2-point edge (50% to 48%) over the Republican nominee. In North Carolina, Trump has a 1-point advantage (50%-49%) over the Democratic nominee. The survey’s findings were all within the poll’s margin of error, suggesting that the four pivotal Sun Belt battleground states remain tossups 10 weeks away from Election Day. President Biden carried Arizona and Georgia in the 2020 election by less than a percentage point, and he won Nevada by just over 2 points. Meanwhile, Trump defeated Biden in North Carolina by just over 1 point in 2020. There are 49 Electoral College votes in play in the four swing states: 16 apiece in North Carolina and Georgia, 11 in Arizona and six in Nevada. The Fox News survey was conducted between Aug. 23-26, after the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which was expected to give Harris a bump in polling. The Trump campaign dismissed the poll’s findings. “It’s that time of year again. Fox is releasing atrocious polling,” the campaign said in a statement. The campaign noted that the network’s polling was “off in North Carolina, Arizona, and Nevada” during the same time period in 2020, and “overstated” Biden’s support in Georgia in their only 2020 survey of the state, released that June. “President Trump continues to outperform polling from past cycles,” the campaign added. “President Trump is 10 points ahead of where he was in Arizona at this point in 2020, according to Fox. Likewise, he is running 8 points ahead of his 2020 polling in Nevada and 5 points ahead of his 2020 polling in North Carolina.” “We see the same trend nationwide.”","summary":"The Fox News survey found Harris holding slim leads in Arizona, Georgia and Nevada; and Trump topping Harris by a razor-thin margin in North Carolina. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/28/us-news/harris-and-trump-locked-in-tight-races-in-four-key-sun-belt-swing-states-new-poll-shows/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88449929.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/01anG99L-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-29 00:14:29","author":"Victor Nava","authors":["Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.645},{"id":255148112,"title":"How Michigan voters feel about Kamala Harris run, RFK Jr. endorsing Trump","text":"How Michigan voters feel about Kamala Harris run, RFK Jr. endorsing Trump Voters in Michigan, a key battleground state in the 2024 election, express their thoughts on the race after Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign began.

George, in a statement on Wednesday, said power would not return to the North, where Atiku is from, until 2031. But in a swift reaction, Atiku’s media adviser, Paul Ibe, knocked George, describing his comment as insensitive and premature. “We cannot afford to put the cart before the horse. At this point, Atiku Abubakar’s preoccupation is not 2027. His concern is about 2024. “It is about 2025 and 2026 and beyond. His concern is about the plight of Nigerians who are literarily going through hell because of the failed trial-and-error policies of this administratio,” Ibe said. But George, in his statement, argued that after the eight years of ex-President Muhammadu Buhari in power, the South must also complete eight years before power can return to the North in 2031. Recently, reports have surfaced of Atiku and other northern political leaders working to shift power back to the North in 2027, when President Bola Tinubu, a southerner, will complete his first term in office. But George, in his statement on Wednesday, argued that a southerner must hold the office of the President from 2023 to 2031 “because that is the reality of our country, the PDP’s Constitution, and our polity.” He stated “In our party, this is the right and logical thing to do in the present political circumstances. But if Alhaji Abubakar is desperate to contest again, I will advise him, as a friend, a party man and a brother, to wait till 2031. By then, he will be 85 years (old).” However, George questioned Atiku’s ambition for public office and urged him to follow the example of U.S. President Joe Biden by stepping aside for younger southerners. “Even in 2027, Atiku will be 81 years and this is the time for him to embrace President Joe Biden’s concept of allowing the younger generation to run for the highest office in the land. “I have nothing personal against Alhaji Abubakar. He is my friend but the truth must be told. By 2027, by God’s Grace, I will also be in my 80s. So, what am I looking for in public office as an octogenarian? The same principle should apply to Alhaji Abubakar. “We all saw what American President, Joe Biden, did recently when he stepped down for Kamala Harris to contest the November presidential election. “That is the hallmark of a statesman. Alhaji Abubakar should do the same so that in 2027, PDP will field a southerner as a presidential candidate.” He argued that there must be fairness, equity and respect for the PDP Constitution. “Fair is fair. I joined the PDP in 1998 and I have remained in this party since. I have not defected to any other party. While I was in Wadata Plaza, Alhaji Abubakar was in the Villa as Vice President. So, we know ourselves and the two of us know the principles guiding this party. “We should not do anything that will destroy our party and the country. In 2027, the concept of Turn-by-Turn Nigeria Limited must be strictly followed by our party. “The PDP must look for a southerner to wrest power from the APC because that party of strange bedfellows wants to destroy this country, economically and politically. “So, Nigerians are waiting for us to rescue them in 2027 but a southerner must lead the battle,” George said.","summary":"Former Deputy National Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party, Chief Bode George, on Monday, said ex-Vice President Atiku Abubakar must wait until 2031 if his desperate to run for President again.

JD Vance of Ohio said Vice President Kamala Harris \"can go to hell\" over the Biden administration's handling of the 2021 withdrawal from Afghanistan. The remark stemmed from an \"incident\" during former President Donald Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Monday to mark three years since a suicide bombing in Kabul killed 13 service members during the chaotic withdrawal from the country. Trump visited part of the cemetery known as Section 60, where veterans of the post-9/11 conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan are laid to rest. While there, an interaction occurred between Trump campaign staff and a cemetery official, according to multiple sources. The dispute appears to be over whether the Trump campaign's photographer had permission to be there. \"Three years ago, 13 brave, innocent Americans died, and they died because Kamala Harris refused to do her job, and there hasn't been a single investigation or a single firing,\" Vance, Trump's running mate, said in response to a reporter's question about the interaction at Arlington National Cemetery while he campaigned in Erie, Pennsylvania. Vance called Harris \"disgraceful\" and said the narrative should be that \"Kamala Harris is so asleep at the wheel that she won't even do an investigation into what happened, and she wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up.\" \"She can go to hell,\" he said. Vance later said in Green Bay, Wisconsin, that his comments were justified. \"Sometimes I get frustrated and pissed off,\" he said, blaming the Harris campaign for \"trying to make a massive political issue\" out of the incident at Arlington National Cemetery. In a statement Monday marking the bombing, Harris said she \"will fulfill our sacred obligation to care for our troops and their families and I will always honor their service and sacrifice.\" \"As I have said, President Biden made the courageous and right decision to end America's longest war,\" she said. The U.S. withdrawal came nearly 20 years after the war began in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The Biden administration and Congress have conducted several investigations into the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. A report from the White House and another from the State Department both partly faulted the Trump administration for the circumstances that contributed to its challenges.","summary":"The Ohio senator's attack stemmed from an \"incident\" during former President Donald Trump's visit to Arlington National Cemetery.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jd-vance-kamala-harris-can-go-to-hell-afghanistan-arlington-cemetery/","image":"https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/28/d52714ea-fdfb-41dc-951b-df56d39f8adb/thumbnail/1200x630/57d4a81242cbe807628788cd8031e0bd/gettyimages-2168129520-1.jpg?v=25685eaa472b1a5dbb5bd46ae506d232","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3154690_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2024-08-28 23:52:45","author":"Caitlin Yilek","authors":["Caitlin Yilek"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.54},{"id":255147318,"title":"Defense officials: Trump campaign told not to take pics at Arlington","text":"By Tara Copp, Adriana Gomez and Hannah Schoenbaum | Associated Press WASHINGTON — Donald Trump’s campaign was warned about not taking photographs before an altercation at Arlington National Cemetery during a wreath-laying ceremony earlier this week to honor service members killed in the Afghanistan War withdrawal, a defense official told The Associated Press on Wednesday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive matter concerning Monday’s events. It came a day after NPR reported, citing a source with knowledge of the incident, that two Trump campaign staff members “verbally abused and pushed” aside a cemetery official who tried to stop them from filming and photographing in Section 60, the burial site for military personnel killed while fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq. The defense official told the AP that the Trump campaign was warned about not taking photographs in Section 60 before their arrival and the altercation. Trump was at Arlington on Monday at the invitation of some of the families of the 13 service members who were killed in the Kabul airport bombing exactly three years prior. Arlington National Cemetery is the resting place for more than 400,000 service members, veterans and their families. Cemetery officials said in a statement that “an incident” had occurred and a report had been filed, but it did not address details of what had happened. They declined to share the report. “Federal law prohibits political campaign or election-related activities within Army National Military Cemeteries, to include photographers, content creators or any other persons attending for purposes, or in direct support of a partisan political candidate’s campaign,” the cemetery officials’ statement said. “Arlington National Cemetery reinforced and widely shared this law and its prohibitions with all participants. We can confirm there was an incident, and a report was filed.” Trump’s spokesperson Steven Cheung said the Republican presidential candidate’s team was granted access to have a photographer. He contested the allegation that a campaign staffer pushed a cemetery official. “The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason, an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony,” he said. Chris LaCivita, a top Trump campaign adviser, noted that Trump was there at the invitation of the families of the service members who were killed in the airport bombing. The Trump campaign posted a message signed by relatives of two of the service members killed in the bombing that said “the president and his team conducted themselves with nothing but the utmost respect and dignity for all of our service members, especially our beloved children.” “For a despicable individual to physically prevent President Trump’s team from accompanying him to this solemn event is a disgrace and does not deserve to represent the hollowed grounds of Arlington National Cemetery,” he said in a written statement, misspelling the word hallowed. “Whoever this individual is, spreading these lies are dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces.” Michael Tyler, a spokesperson for Trump’s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, called the reports “pretty sad when it’s all said and done.” “This is what we’ve come to expect from Donald Trump and his team,” Tyler said on CNN. “Donald Trump is a person who wants to make everything all about Donald Trump. He’s also somebody who has a history of demeaning and degrading military service members, those who have given the ultimate sacrifice.” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox also came under fire Wednesday for including a photo of him and Trump at the ceremony in a campaign email soliciting donations for his reelection bid. The Republican governor recently surprised voters when he pledged his support to Trump just after the July assassination attempt, despite saying days earlier on CNN that he hadn’t voted for Trump in 2016 or 2020 and would not cast a ballot for him again this year. Cox’s sudden embrace of Trump, who has not endorsed him back, represents a puzzling departure from his carefully curated persona as a Mitt Romney-esque moderate. Cox’s campaign has apologized for using the photo and politicizing the graveside ceremony. “This was not a campaign event and was never intended to be used by the campaign,” the governor wrote in a post on X. “It did not go through the proper channels and should not have been sent.” Democratic U.S. Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia has called on cemetery officials to release more information about what happened Monday. “It’s sad but all too expected that Donald Trump would desecrate this hallowed ground and put campaign politics ahead of honoring our heroes,” he said. “His behavior and that of his campaign is abhorrent and shameful.” Trump’s running mate JD Vance was asked about the incident Wednesday at a campaign event in Erie, Pennsylvania, and said that “apparently somebody at Arlington Cemetery, some staff member, had a little disagreement with somebody” and “the media has turned this into a national news story.” He instead tried to focus on the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, calling Harris “disgraceful” for not firing anyone for the deaths of service members in the terror attack. The Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the attack. A Pentagon investigation into the deadly attack concluded that the suicide bomber acted alone and that the deaths of more than 170 Afghans and 13 U.S. service members were not preventable. But critics have slammed the Biden administration for the catastrophic evacuation, saying it should have started earlier than it did.

Instead, it’ll be a two-on-one chat with veep-nominee Tim Walz as her wingman. And it’ll be pre-taped, to air at 9 p.m.: America will never know what Harris word salads (or worse) get left on the cutting-room floor. And it won’t be, say, Fox News’ Brett Baier asking the questions, but Kam-friendly Dana Bash from Kam-friendly CNN (no doubt because her campaign couldn’t find a “journalist” more in love with Harris and hostile to Donald Trump). Making it a tag-team “defense” understandably has sparked the most outrage, but all the arrangements show that Harris’ campaign wants the least possible transparency. This is the woman who wants to be the first female president? Unable to face an objective reporter, live, on her own? How will she handle adversaries like Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping? No, this looks less like an interview and more of an infomercial — all spin, from start to finish. The big test for Bash is whether she pushes Harris to explain and defend her plans: Does she truly now favor fracking, as her campaign suggests? Or is she closer to her 2019 vow, “There’s no question I’m in favor of banning” it? And if she really is flipping, why was she wrong before? Does she plan on pushing government-only health care — Medicare for All — and the end of private insurance, as she suggested back then? If not, what changed? Is she still a backer of the Green New Deal? How does her sudden willingness to fund Trump’s border wall square with her earlier view that funding it “would be a gross misuse of taxpayer money”? Indeed, a new Harris ad paints her as eager to beef up security at the border; it even shows pictures of the wall. So why hasn’t Harris — President Biden’s border czar — seen that it’s already beefed up? Most important: This is one single interview; even if Bash gets tough, voters can only learn a bit. A normal nominee has been doing debates, town halls, press conferences and one-on-one interviews for a year at this point — and has detailed a host of policies and plans. To level with the public, Harris should be doing at least one interview a day, right up to Nov. 5.","summary":"Kamala Harris will sit for her first interview on Thursday, but it won't be live with an objective reporter but pre-taped, hosted by her adoring fan CNN's Dana Bash.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/28/opinion/kamala-harris-first-interview-will-really-be-an-infomercial/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-hav4uzptk-1724886483081.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1724872131&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 23:40:01","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.27},{"id":255147136,"title":"RFK Jr. could persuade moms like me to choose Trump as ‘Kennedy Republicans’","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s endorsement of former President Donald Trump is a classic example of Ronald Reagan’s famous explanation for the change in his political allegiance: “I didn’t leave the Democratic Party, the Democratic Party left me.” And it has the power to tip the election in Trump’s favor, especially in the swing states that will decide it. Endorsements, while highly coveted by politicians, don’t usually change election outcomes, but this one feels different. Kennedy, a blue-blood Democrat from the nation’s most famous political dynasty, is speaking to many fellow “former Democrats” — especially newly activated moms like me. In contrast to the hasty anointment and enforced “joy” of Kamala Harris — who until a month ago was a historically unpopular vice president — Kennedy raises big issues and treats voters like adults whose votes must be earned. He talks about topics that have traditionally galvanized liberal and progressive Democrats: free speech, protecting the vulnerable, championing the environment and fighting for the American family. School closures, migrant surges, steep inflation and radical gender policies have created disgruntled Democrats and irate independents who might vote for a Republican — think of how in past decades Rudy Giuliani, George Pataki and Michael Bloomberg fared in deep-blue New York. These voters have so far resisted Trump and the MAGA movement, but RFK has a shot at swaying them. Last week the independent presidential candidate went all-in on a stirring explanation of what “Make America Great Again” really means. “Troubled liberals,” he acknowledged, may think it signals a “return to an America before civil rights, gay rights and women’s rights.” But RFK said that for him, Trump’s signature phrase “recalls a nation brimming with vitality, with a can-do spirit, with hope and a belief in itself . . . a nation of broad prosperity, the world’s most vibrant middle class and an idealistic belief (though not consistently applied) in freedom, justice and democracy.” His words resonate with me, a former Bernie Sanders supporter who has voted Democrat in every presidential election for three decades. I even ran for office as a Democrat — for City Council in 2021 and Congress in 2022 — trying doggedly, and unsuccessfully, to pull my party out of the fringe left and back to the moderate middle. But elected Democrats in New York, many of whom I voted for, have now lurched so far left that they’re punishing public school parents for merely suggesting that we discuss — just discuss! — school gender guidelines that allow boys in girls’ sports. It’s hard to square the values that originally made me a Democrat with what I saw at the party’s national convention, top-heavy with rich, elite scolds who think they are better and know better. I saw self-satisfied censors comfortable with authoritarian edicts about our health care, hypocrites about public education, cavalier about our kids’ curriculum morphing into left-wing indoctrination sessions. People who still prefer dangerous Defund the Police policies over law and order, and have a weird fixation on promoting abortion, rather than the “safe, legal and rare” framework most Americans support. Ronald Reagan’s ability to speak to middle-class voters about their actual concerns created the “Reagan Democrat.” Kennedy’s earnest articulation on real issues like solving childhood obesity, stopping expensive foreign wars and decrying the censorship that leads to totalitarianism now has the power to create “Kennedy Republicans” — a voting bloc that could decide our next president. The shameful efforts to wage lawfare against both Trump and Kennedy to keep both men off the ballot were meant to silence their ideas instead of offering better ones. Moms who objected to school closures can relate: The Harris-Biden administration did the same thing to us, by pressuring media platforms. That’s why organizations like Moms for Liberty, which will host Trump this weekend at their national summit, have attracted so many former Democrats. Kennedy may have started a trend: On Monday, Tulsi Gabbard, another former Democratic presidential candidate, announced her endorsement of Trump, citing foreign-policy concerns chief among her motivations. Both of them have joined Trump’s transition team. Kennedy’s and Gabbard’s desire to talk about the big issues stands in sharp contrast to the “brat” veep who won’t articulate or defend her policies to the press. And Harris has a record — she was named the Senate’s “most liberal” member in 2019, and has floated Marxist ideas like price controls and “equality of outcomes.” For Democrats wary of radical left-wing policies, it’s time to reverse course. “Kennedy Republican” has a nice ring to it.

Mosquitoes need standing water to complete their life cycle. We should eliminate sources of water where mosquitoes can breed in our backyards or public places like parks. Here are the guidelines from the Alameda County Mosquito Abatement District to reduce the risk of contracting mosquito-borne diseases: • Dump or drain standing water on your property to decrease the opportunity for mosquitoes to breed. • Dawn and dusk are when mosquito activity peaks; limit outdoor activities during this time. • Defend yourself from mosquito bites by wearing long pants and long-sleeved shirts and apply insect repellent containing EPA-registered active ingredients such as DEET, Picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon eucalyptus. • Doors and window screens should be in good condition with no tears or holes.

On Jan. 20, 2017, Donald Trump swore an oath to “preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.” On Jan. 6, 2021, Trump betrayed and broke that oath by trying to stop the certification of the 2020 presidential election, an election that was not “stolen” and was clearly won by Joe Biden. Donald Trump is not fit to hold the office of the president, because he has already betrayed his oath to the U.S. Constitution and to all of the American people.

Trump’s former chief of staff, retired Marine General John Kelly, confirmed that Trump refused to visit an American cemetery in France because it was full of “losers.” Trump also referred to WWI Marine dead as “suckers,” according to reports confirmed by Kelly. So what does it mean when Trump lays a wreath in Arlington cemetery at the tombs of U.S. soldiers killed during the evacuation of Afghanistan? Not sincerity. Instead, he wants a photo-op to criticize Kamala Harris and Joe Biden. Remember that Trump negotiated a deal with the Taliban for a U.S. pullout from Afghanistan, and Biden felt obligated to honor the commitment of his predecessor. But in the perceptive words of one Taliban commander during our guerrilla war in Iraq and Afghanistan: “You have the watches. We have the time.” Afghanistan fell to the Taliban quickly thereafter. Bob Benson Lafayette Elect a president who respects difference Re: Cartoon by Jeff Koterba (Page A6, Aug. 27). Jeff Koterba’s cartoon about his Tourette’s syndrome and his painful examples of bullying brought tears to my eyes. It needs to be said that Donald Trump has not shown himself to be kind to people who are different. He mocks others repeatedly. He denigrates their appearances and refers to them by childish nicknames, acts that reflect an endorsement of cruelty as a legitimate tool for winning a campaign. The ugly remarks made about Tim Walz’s son after the Democratic convention suggest that some people might view Trump’s behavior as consent to be publicly rude. It is not enough to consider Trump’s policy issues when we vote. It’s also important to remember what kind of people we want to be as Americans, that we must strive to be more accepting of those who present different ways to be human. Our leaders should be role models who guide us in that direction. Teri Shikany Danville Trump isn’t the pick to protect women Donald Trump and Republicans are quick to criticize Kamala Harris for not interviewing with the press. But Trump isn’t any better.

As Blaze Media reports, Trump was more specifically at Arlington to pay respect to the 13 service members killed three years ago during the Biden-Harris administration’s disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. Trump’s appearance drew the ire of Esquire magazine’s political blogger, Charles P. Pierce who asked, \"How the hell was this allowed to happen?\" As pointed out by Blaze, \"this is the same cemetery, where last year the Biden-Harris administration trampled graves and toppled the Jewish American-designed Reconciliation Memorial, which is open to members of the public, so it's unclear who exactly Pierce figured would prevent Trump's entry.” Last month, family members of several of the service members killed in the Afghanistan withdrawal took the stage at the Republican National Convention.

Trump has long portrayed himself as a champion of service members and veterans — an image bolstered by participants in Monday's ceremony. But he has also created a pattern of disparaging service members that has led even some former aides to question the authenticity of his support for the military. The latest episode threatens to blunt his attacks on President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris over a 2021 terrorist assault at the so-called Abbey Gate of the Kabul airport, which killed 13 American service members. It was the third anniversary of the bombings, which occurred during the harried U.S. exit from Afghanistan, that took Trump to the Arlington burial ground, in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, on Monday. He laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier to honor those who died in the bombings and then moved to Section 60, an area reserved for participants in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars. Trump was joined at both sites by family members of the men and women killed at Abbey Gate. The family members invited him to participate in the commemoration, and they wanted the moment to be documented, according to two people who were present. \"I gave my permission,\" Kelly Barnett, the mother of Marine Staff Sgt. Darin “Taylor” Hoover, told NBC News. \"I wanted the memories. I wanted to make sure that my family at home — I have a huge family — I wanted to make sure that they were involved with it, as well, and they could see it and feel it, have the experience that we had. And so I said, yeah, in no uncertain terms, I was OK with it.\" Trump posed for a photograph beside Hoover's grave, smiling and giving a thumbs-up gesture in a shot that included the headstones of other service members who were not part of Monday's ceremony. A federal regulation admonishes that memorial services at Army cemeteries \"will not include partisan political activities.\" NPR first reported Tuesday that two Trump campaign staffers had a confrontation with a cemetery official who tried to prevent them from filming. \"We can confirm there was an incident, and a report was filed,\" the cemetery said in a statement. Whatever happened, Barnett and another participant — who asked to remain anonymous without authorization to speak for the families — said they noticed nothing amiss. \"We didn't even hear about it until the next day,\" the second participant said, who did not believe Trump's participation amounted to campaign activity. \"It wasn't politicized,\" this person said. Trump posted video that included clips from Monday's ceremony to his TikTok account. In the video, he blamed Biden and Harris for the deaths at the Kabul airport. Trump, like most Republican presidential candidates in recent decades, has won the majority of voters who have served in the military, according to exit polls. But his edge was smaller in his defeat in 2020 — 54% to 44% — than when he won that part of the electorate 61% to 34% in taking the presidency in 2016. His aides have publicly dismissed the report of a physical interaction at the cemetery and accused Democrats of ignoring the anniversary, which is the most poignant reminder of a withdrawal that was politically damaging to Biden. “They’re trying to muddle the fact that there was only one commander in chief in Arlington on Aug. 26,\" LaCivita said. He noted that Biden was on vacation and that Harris did not visit Arlington on the anniversary. Both of them issued statements. Neither Trump nor Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, served in uniform. Their running mates, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., did. Harris' campaign declined to comment on the report of an altercation at Arlington, but its communications director, Michael Tyler, addressed it in a CNN interview Wednesday. \"Frankly, I think this episode is pretty sad when it’s all said and done,\" Tyler said. \"Listen, this is what we’ve come to expect from Donald Trump and his team. Donald Trump is a person who wants to make everything all about Donald Trump. He’s also somebody who has a history of demeaning and degrading military service members, those who have given the ultimate sacrifice.\" A Trump adviser who spoke with NBC News pointed to a statement signed by five Gold Star family members and two Purple Heart recipients who were with Trump on Monday defending him amid the firestorm. They said in the statement that they gave approval for Trump’s videographer and photographer to capture those moments so they could “cherish these memories forever.” “Everything involved in the day was at their invitation,” this person said. “It wasn’t a campaign event. It was an event done by the families of these people, and they invited the commander-in-chief who has consistently demonstrated strong and unwavering support for them and all service members and their families.” This person said that Trump was “grateful” for the invitation and that he would show “how committed he is when he’s back in the White House to ensure that the people who manufactured that insane and disastrous withdrawal are held accountable for it.” The Trump campaign's handling of the episode after details leaked to the media raised some eyebrows among Republicans, particularly a statement in which communications director Steven Cheung said \"an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump's team during a very solemn ceremony.\" A Republican operative, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the statement \"so unprofessional.\" A Trump ally, meanwhile, said the \"behavior\" outlined at the cemetery was \"really out of character\" for the campaign. For years, Trump has faced accusations of showing disrespect to veterans and service members. Early this year, he mocked the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for being unable to raise his arms because of injuries he sustained as a prisoner of war. In 2015, he also said McCain was not a \"war hero\" because \"he was captured.\" \"I like people that weren't captured,\" he said at the time. McCain, a veteran of the Vietnam War, gained national recognition for his time as a prisoner of war in the infamous \"Hanoi Hilton,\" where he was tortured. This cycle, Trump also questioned why Nikki Haley's husband was not with her on the campaign trail during the Republican primaries. Maj. Michael Haley was serving overseas at the time. Just this month, Trump described the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is a civilian honor, as \"much better\" than the Medal of Honor, a military honor, because recipients of the latter are often deceased or severely injured. Former White House chief of staff John Kelly said last year his former boss denigrated veterans and service members as \"suckers\" and \"losers,\" confirming remarks that were published in The Atlantic years earlier. Trump has vehemently and repeatedly denied making such comments. Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat and Army veteran, pointed to Trump's comments about the Medal of Honor and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, adding that the episode at Arlington National Cemetery appeared to be a \"continuation of something that I just find really problematic.\" \"There is this attacking of those with military service and this increasing politicization and disrespect for those who have chosen to serve this country,\" he said, adding that he still wanted to learn more details about what happened between Trump's staff and the cemetery official. At their convention last week, Democrats took Trump to task over military issues, emphasizing a theme of patriotism. Former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said that Trump \"does not understand the service and sacrifice of our military\" and that he was the only president since World War II who has not \"honored our veterans and their sacrifices.\" But for Republicans, the episode served to further shine a light on what they see as one of the Biden administration's biggest failings in Afghanistan, a key piece of their message on global instability over the past four years. “The veterans that I talk to feel disrespected and disappointed, certainly at their commander in chief, in the direction of the United States militarily,” Pennsylvania state Rep. Rob Mercuri, a veteran and congressional candidate in the 17th District, which is a swing district with a large veteran population. “The only thing I would say about President Trump is that his plan is to project strength. My view is that the Reagan Doctrine of peace through strength is really important to come back to.”","summary":"Trump's campaign is playing down reports of an altercation during his visit to Arlington National Cemetery on Monday, a move that signals its concern about potential political fallout from the incident.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/trump-team-arlington-cemetery-incident-political-fallout-afghanistan-rcna168600","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-08/240827-donald-trump-arlington-se-1012p-fb8203.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 23:22:26","author":"Allan Smith,Garrett Haake,Jonathan Allen","authors":["Allan Smith","Garrett Haake","Jonathan Allen"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.139},{"id":255146500,"title":"Exploring Southeast Georgia: Harris and Walz Begin Bus Tour","text":"Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris greets Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, as Rep.

They fell in love with conservative politics thanks to Ronald Reagan, and they’re ambivalent about Trump. Over Labor Day weekend, they’ll have a chance to travel back to the golden age of the 1980s — but they can’t afford to stay there. “Reagan,” a biographical film many years in the making and starring Dennis Quaid as the man who becomes the 40th president, opens Aug. 30. It’s not going to challenge “Deadpool and Wolverine” for dominance at the box office. Nor is the movie — directed by Sean McNamara and based on Paul Kengor’s book “The Crusader: Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism” — going to sweep next year’s Academy Awards. It’s a modest production about a great man, but it comes at a time when old-guard conservatives are more uncertain than ever about how today’s GOP, the party of Trump, relates to Reagan’s principles. Stoking their doubts are bitter ex-Republicans who now make a living by sowing division on the right and plumping for Democrats. These are jilted consultants, defeated office-holders who blame Trump for their crashed careers, and a dozen or so pundits who once thought they could script the party’s direction — and would now rather be rewarded by the other side than swallow their pride and admit their mistakes. These bad-faith actors have made a habit of appropriating Reagan’s name, taking advantage of the fact he hasn’t been around to defend it for 20 years and was sidelined by Alzheimer’s a decade before that. The new movie offers no aid or comfort to phony conservatives for Kamala. Kengor, a professor at Grove City College in Pennsylvania who became the editor of The American Spectator two years ago, is a plumb-line conservative. His book and the biopic based on it showcase Reagan’s anti-Communism. But it’s true that Reagan’s gentility is nothing like Trump’s provocative personality. And some Reagan Republicans wonder if Trump hasn’t turned his back on the free-market policies that the Gipper championed, despite the historic tax cut Trump delivered in his first term. Does the Trump-Vance ticket’s support for tariffs and courting of trade unions show a disregard for what Reagan stood for? Republicans who ask themselves that may not vote for Harris, but if their enthusiasm for this year’s GOP nominee wanes, as they look longingly back to 1984, the potential for Trump to fall short in the swing states is grave. The undecided neighbor notices when the Republican next door isn’t eager to get out and vote — or go door-to-door volunteering — for his party’s candidate. In battleground states where outcomes are as close as they were in 2016 and 2020, morale is decisive: Just ask Hillary Clinton, who thought “blue wall” voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan would turn out for her whether or not she showed up to ask for their votes. Yet Trump in fact has delivered for Reagan voters — just as, back in the day, Reagan delivered for the Americans who are now Trump voters. Trump’s get-tough attitude on trade was Reagan’s, too, and both were willing to use tariffs as necessary: Reagan saved Harley-Davidson by hiking tariffs on Japanese motorcycles more than tenfold, from 4.4% to a high of 49.4%. The real Reagan, not the Trump-shaming myth, courted union voters and unions themselves, yet didn’t let even those that endorsed him, like the air-traffic controllers’ PATCO, dictate policy or jeopardize the national interest. Trump returned America to the Reagan principle of peace through strength in foreign policy — while Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have unleashed chaos on a scale reminiscent of the Carter administration, when Iran seized American hostages and the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan. Under Harris and Biden, there are American hostages in the Middle East once again, and Russia is brutalizing Ukraine. Trump doesn’t speak in the idealistic register of Reagan, but he’s like Reagan in his willingness to engage in daring diplomacy — as Reagan did with Mikhail Gorbachev — and also like him in boldly changing the way Americans think about our most dangerous rival. In Reagan’s time that was the USSR — today it’s China, and Trump has forced both parties to stop being complacent about Beijing. The Reagan movie ought to remind voters who cherish the Gipper’s record that history hinged on his election. The future of all Reagan secured for the country back then now hinges on what happens in this election, between a Republican who overall continues the Reagan legacy and a Democrat — Kamala Harris — who wants the memory of Reagan’s America to go the way of the Soviet Union.

Stone told people that Kennedy, whose third-party campaign served as a vehicle for his anti-vaccine views, was peeling off enough voters to tip the election to Kamala Harris. “You have maybe 3% of voters where opposition to vaccines is their one issue,” says a Republican who participated in the courtship of Kennedy. But getting Kennedy and Trump to forge an alliance almost didn’t happen. The two New York scions have famously big egos and a history of viciously attacking each other. Trump previously called Kennedy a “phony, radical-left fool,” a “Democratic ‘plant,’” and a “liberal lunatic.” Kennedy, meanwhile, wrote a 2018 Newsweek op-ed that said Trump’s “presidency has not just discredited our nation, but the entire American experiment in self government.” A breakthrough came following the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump’s life at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. A few hours after the shooting, Carlson put Trump and Kennedy on a text thread together, according to a person briefed on the communications. Kennedy texted Trump that he was ready to drop out and endorse him but wasn’t sure of the timing, the source says. On a phone call the following day, Trump courted Kennedy by endorsing Kennedy’s unproven view that vaccines hurt children. “When you feed a baby, Bobby, a vaccination that is like 38 different vaccines and it looks like it’s meant for a horse, not a, you know, 10-pound or 20-pound baby,” Trump said, “and then you see the baby all of a sudden starting to change radically. I’ve seen it too many times.” But the relationship hit a setback when Kennedy’s son, Robert Kennedy III, posted a video of the call with Trump to social media. The damage control fell to Florida financier Omeed Malik, a Trump donor and close friend of Don Jr. and Robert Kennedy III. (Malik’s anti-woke private equity firm, 1789 Capital, invested in Tucker Carlson’s digital video venture.) Malik arranged an in-person meeting between Trump and Kennedy on the opening day of the Republican convention to discuss an endorsement. According to people briefed on the meeting, Kennedy came in with unrealistic expectations that he could be FDA chairman or Health and Human Services Secretary in a Trump administration. “There were asks,” a source briefed on the talks tells me. (Kennedy denied this.) “The meeting concluded without a deal,” the source says. The Trump campaign declined to comment. Talks between Kennedy and Trump went dark. Over the next several weeks, Malik worked behind the scenes to bring Trump and Kennedy back together. According to the source, Kennedy and Trump agreed on four broad policy areas: treating chronic disease, opposing censorship, adopting an isolationist foreign policy, and exposing the deep state. The source said the deal-breaker was that Kennedy needed to be on Trump’s transition team. “That was nonnegotiable,” the source says. “There was no quid pro quo of any kind,” Kennedy tells Vanity Fair. On Tuesday, the Trump campaign announced Kennedy would serve as an honorary co-chair of the transition alongside former Democratic congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard. “This is going to give Bobby the ability to decide who gets into government,” the source says. Former Trump adviser Sam Nunberg says Kennedy’s presence on the transition is a signal to anti-vax voters that Trump will be an ally in office. “This is Trump’s way of winking to Kennedy’s supporters,” Nunberg says. One open question is what role Kennedy’s vice presidential pick, Nicole Shanahan, might play in Trumpworld. On Tuesday, Shanahan declined to say if she would campaign for Trump. And she disputed that Kennedy dropped out of the race. “We are technically still running and on the ballot! Just suspended,” she texted.","summary":"Tucker Carlson and Roger Stone are said to be among the Trump allies supporting a pact with Kennedy, who, sources say, was finally swayed with a transition role. “There was no quid pro quo of any kind,” Kennedy tells Vanity Fair.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/donald-trump-rfk-jr-alliance","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/66cf7b1ea50260ed0422d3e8/16:9/w_6912,h_3888,c_limit/vf0824-rkf-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 23:07:42","author":"Gabriel Sherman","authors":["Gabriel Sherman"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.268},{"id":255147352,"title":"Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump is also stepping up his campaign in the US swing states","text":"Republican candidate and former president Donald Trump is also stepping up his campaign in the US swing states | National News | guampdn.com Skip to main content You have permission to edit this image.

She’s extremely boring with no personality.” Kelly continued the intensely personal attacks, saying “I have a pro tip for her: Smile, try smiling every once in a while.” “Try not to be, like in your delivery, such a cold-hearted b*tch all the time, because it gives people nothing to bond to,” Kelly carried on, unprompted. “You can be a tough interviewer and also have some warmth—unless there’s none inside of you, in which case it’s more difficult.” Kelly then admitted that she doesn’t even know Collins personally, after leveling attacks on her character.

Kennedy Jr., who stood on stage prepared to endorse Trump over the objection of his own family. “But they would not let him.” Kennedy’s support for Trump comes after weeks of momentum by Vice President Kamala Harris. President Joe Biden’s exit from the race gave her a polling boost, which even Trump’s team expects to continue after last week’s widely watched Democratic National Convention. Kennedy was running for president as a Democrat before becoming an independent, but then last week dropped his bid completely and backed Trump. The rally in Phoenix, which opened with the sort of strobe lights and pyrotechnics expected at a concert or monster truck rally, was Kennedy’s splashy coming-out party in Republican politics. The Kennedy family has openly viewed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as their black sheep because he both flirts with right-wing conspiracies — most notably as a vocal voice in the anti-vaccination movement — and has been well outside the Democratic Party’s political mainstream. But for Trump’s campaign, the endorsement from Kennedy has been framed as a huge win — even though it came from someone Trump himself called “liberal” when Kennedy was still running for president. The Trump campaign gave the Kennedy endorsement more oxygen than perhaps any other endorsement to date, hoping he can convince some disenchanted Democrats and skeptical conservatives to come aboard. Beyond the rock star greeting Kennedy received in Phoenix, Trump and his campaign-aligned social media accounts have spent a significant time hyping the endorsement. There has been such a rush of intensity that some social media accounts run by Trump allies with huge followings have joked that Trump-Kennedy is the real Republican ticket instead of the actual running mate: Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. “The strongest anti-establishment ticket in American History,” tweeted Benny Johnson, a right-wing social media influencer with 2.7 million followers. The infamous “Distracted Boyfriend” meme was also repurposed to show Trump longing after Kennedy while a hapless Vance looked on. Vance laughed off the meme when told about it in an interview on Tuesday. “The meme stuff just doesn’t bother me at all,” he told NBC News aboard his plane. “I’ve never worried about where I stand with him [Trump], and I’ve never worried about whether we’re going to win this race. I just have to play the role that I can. And if that means RFK gets more headlines in a given week, good for him.” Trump himself has repeatedly posted about the Kennedy endorsement on his social media pages, and he and his supporters have used the endorsement of both Kennedy and former Democratic Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii as proof of a generational “realignment” of American politics. Like Kennedy, Gabbard — who has been helping Trump with debate prep — is seen as out-of-step with mainstream Democratic politics, but the Trump campaign has said that her and Kennedy’s support is proof he is able to attract Democrats upset by the state of their own party. Both were named to Trump’s transition team this week, but only Kennedy received the rock star-like welcome to Team Trump after his endorsement. Kennedy has long said his top policy priorities are stopping government censorship — especially on social media platforms — ending foreign wars and focusing on boosting the nation’s health, especially among children. Part of his welcome message to the Trump campaign was “Make America Healthy Again.” Vance told reporters Tuesday that those are perfect focuses for Kennedy on the campaign trail or for the Trump transition team. “I think RFK talks about a lot of stuff that, frankly, the media does not talk about, like why do we have one of the highest obesity rates in the world?” Vance said. “Why do we have such bad health problems with our kids, skyrocketing rates of mental abuse, skyrocketing rates of addiction?” Spokespeople for Vance and the Trump campaign would speculate on any role Kennedy would have in a potential Trump administration, but a Trump official said the former president is aligned with Kennedy on most of his top-tier policy priorities. The two do disagree on some issues, most prominently abortion, but have said their new alliance is about larger existential threats to the country. Longtime Republican operative and Trump supporter Roger Stone says that Kennedy’s addition to the campaign can help offset perceived Trump weaknesses, mainly the fact that during his time in the White House his administration created a Covid-19 vaccination program now wildly unpopular with Republican base voters and something Kennedy vocally opposes. Another area where Stone thought Kennedy could help is balancing the fact that Trump appointed people to key posts — like FBI Director Christopher Wray and former national security adviser H.R. McMaster — who are now deeply unpopular with Trump supporters. They are seen as part of a prior era of GOP politics that supported U.S. involvement in foreign wars over domestic interests. “I think he has several different values,” Stone said of Kennedy. “If you think one of the complaints of some about the Trump presidency is the handling of the [Covid vaccine rollout] and pandemic and the appointment of neo-cons, Kennedy is clearly critical of the vaccine and those people.” “I think he is able to reassure voters,” Stone added. On Kennedy’s well-known vaccine skepticism, Vance told NBC News that his three children have received “the standard vaccines,” but he likes Kennedy’s “general skepticism” to the public health bureaucracy. “That doesn’t mean that I agree with him on every issue, but I do think that we should be a little bit more willing to challenge public health authorities in the wake of Covid,” Vance said. Trump’s embrace of Kennedy prompted the sort of backlash to be expected from the Democratic National Committee, which worked to keep Kennedy off the ballot in several states and outlined its opposition to him in a memo last Friday, but also from Kennedy’s own family, who has long opposed his political viewpoints. “Our brother Bobby’s decision to endorse Trump today is a betrayal of the values that our father and our family hold most dear,” his sister Kerry Kennedy and four other family members said in a statement on X. The DNC memo referred to “disqualifying acts” — a nod to a series of bizarre stories that have come out in recent weeks about Kennedy, such as him being behind a well-known incident in which a dead bear cub was dumped in Central Park, and another in which Kennedy used a chainsaw to cut the head off a dead whale. A potential complication moving forward is the fact that while Kennedy has said he is dropping his bid for president, he will likely be on the ballot in up to two-dozen states. Kennedy said he would remove his name from the ballot in 10 states considered toss-ups, but has not yet specified those states. Judges in Nevada and Pennsylvania, key swing states, have approved removing Kennedy’s name from the ballot. Conversely, judges in the key “blue wall” states of Michigan, Wisconsin and Minnesota have ruled that Kennedy’s name will appear on the ballot in those states. A memo from Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio released shortly after Kennedy’s endorsement showed that his exit from the race helped Trump in seven key swing states: Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Nevada and Pennsylvania, as well as Wisconsin and Michigan. “The net vote gained in a state like Arizona based on just 2020 turnout model would be over 41,000 votes, nearly 4 times Biden’s winning margin,” Fabrizio wrote. “In Georgia the net gain would be over 19,000 votes nearly twice Biden’s margin.” “This is good news for President Trump and his campaign — plain and simple,” he added.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAs 21 columns of fire shot out of the stage, Donald Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Administration Welcomes RFK with Enthusiasm to Gain Support from Doubters first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-administration-welcomes-rfk-with-enthusiasm-to-gain-support-from-doubters/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Trump-world-rolls-out-the-red-carpet.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 23:00:29","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.273},{"id":255148318,"title":"Democrats hoped population growth would turn North Carolina blue, but here's how Trump is crushing those hopes","text":"Democrats believed that population growth in high-density areas of North Carolina would help them turn the red tide, but a separate trend might crush those hopes completely. The Cook Political Report changed North Carolina from a right-leaning to a toss-up state based on demographic trends, but an analysis by NBC poll analyst Steve Kornacki says former President Donald Trump is also gaining in Republican-leaning parts of the state. 'Republicans have made gains. They sort of almost canceled each other out there.' Kornacki points out that Democrats have been able to shave down Trump's advantage in the state from a gap of about 175k votes in the 2016 election down to only 75k votes in the 2020 election against Biden. This has led many Democrats to believe that Vice President Kamala Harris might be able to turn the state blue. \"One thing we see is Democratic support getting increasingly concentrated geographically into metropolitan areas, suburbs with high concentrations of college diplomas,\" he explained. However, despite the city and metro parts of the state becoming more Democratic, Kornacki says that Trump has been able to make up the difference by pushing the red parts of the state farther to the right. In one example cited in the analysis, Trump was able to win Hamilton County with a margin of 25 points in 2020 after former President Barack Obama lost the same county by only eight points in 2016. While the county is small in terms of population, it could be a stand-in for all the other Republican-leaning parts of the state, which are smaller in population but greater in total number, Kornacki says. \"Smaller counties, more diffuse geographically, Republicans have made gains. They sort of almost canceled each other out there,\" he said. Kornacki went on to say that if Democrats are able to turn out the blue vote in the more populous regions, they might have a chance to win the state and switch 11 electoral votes from the red column to the blue column.

The primetime sit-down set to air on CNN Thursday will be the first for Harris since the vice president secured the delegate votes to replace President Joe Biden as the Democratic nominee. “Should CNN have insisted on a one-on-one interview with Harris and turned down a joint interview with Harris and Walz?” former CBS News White House Correspondent Mark Knoller tweeted. “Too tough to walk away from. But first question to Harris ought to be why should [sic] couldn’t appear solo.” Knoller is reinforcing the conservative talking point that Harris is unqualified and unprepared to be president. That talking point is loaded with racism and sexism, but it’s also free of historical context or the clear track record of political candidates doing dual interviews with their running mates—and journalists like Knoller should know better. Who could forget when Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, sat down to talk with Fox News dirtbag Jesse Watters in July? That’s when Trump revealed his sorry reason for choosing the political kryptonite that is Vance. Spoiler alert: Vance was chosen because he liked Trump, “maybe more than anybody liked me.” Then there was the profoundly awkward interview Trump did with his previous running mate, Mike Pence, in 2016. This was less than four years before Trump-inspired MAGA insurgents set about trying to hang the evangelical politician at the Capitol for refusing to stop the certification of electoral votes. Trump’s opponent Hillary Clinton did an interview alongside her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, in 2016. Remember when Sen. Mitt Romney and his rising star Republican running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, sat down with “60 Minutes” in 2012? And in 2008, then-Sen. Barack Obama sat down with “60 Minutes” alongside his running mate, then-Sen. Joe Biden. Keep in mind that Harris is in a unique situation because incumbent Biden announced his decision to drop out of the race a mere 38 days ago, setting the stage for her historic run. Unlike Trump, who literally never stopped campaigning (even when he became president) or any previous presidential candidate, Harris hasn’t had a year or more to campaign and grant numerous interviews. Instead, she has had little more than one month to vet and choose a running mate, build a coalition of supporters in record time, hold rallies across the country, and pull off a wildly successful Democratic National Convention. Considering Harris and Walz’s excellent chemistry, Thursday night’s interview should be a fun watch. Tune in to watch the joyful duo continue to trigger the hell out of right-wingers everywhere.","summary":"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov.

Zelenskyy has only outlined the plan in broad strokes, but Russian President Vladimir Putin reiterated Wednesday that he’s not interested in a diplomatic resolution. That rejection means Zelenskyy’s plan isn’t actually a realistic framework for ending the war any time soon. But it is nevertheless a useful document that outlines one scenario for how the war might end — and seems to be a tacit acknowledgement that Ukraine does not see a path to ending the conflict through force. Zelenskyy outlined the plan’s four components as: * Continuing Ukraine’s recent incursion into Russia’s Kursk region — troops entered the area in early August and now hold more than 500 square miles of territory in an effort to pull Russian troops away from the frontline in eastern Ukraine. * Ensuring “security architecture” — a vague element that likely refers to Ukraine’s potential membership in NATO and the European Union. * Receiving a “powerful package” — likely referring to weapons — which will push Russia to enter into negotiations. Ukraine has requested more arms from allies (Zelenskyy will also probably ask permission to use weapons in Russian territory, something that was until recently forbidden). * Advancing an economic component — there’s little clarity about this piece of the plan, but it likely refers to increased sanctions on Russia. The focus on weapons, security, and Kursk seems to suggest the overarching goal of the plan is to force Russia to the negotiation table through continued military action. Zelenskyy said he intends to present the plan to US President Joe Biden in September, when the Ukrainian president plans to attend the United Nations General Assembly, as well as to presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. “The success of this plan depends on [Biden],” Zelenskyy said Tuesday, in a seeming acknowledgement of the US’ and NATO allies’ role in keeping Ukraine stocked with weapons. “Will they give what we have in this plan or not? Will we be free to use what we have in this plan or not?” But even as Zelenskyy discussed his plan to end the war — which has decimated large swaths of Ukraine’s southeast and driven hundreds of thousands of Russians into exile — Russia launched multiple air attacks against targets in southeastern and central Ukraine. Those attacks killed at least two people at a hotel in Zelenskyy’s hometown of Kryvyi Rih, and targeted nearly half of Ukraine’s regions, including the capital Kyiv and the Zaporizhzhia region, the site of Europe’s largest nuclear power plant. The path to peace is still extremely fraught; Zelenskyy’s plan doesn’t change that There are still many barriers to peace. Chief among them is that Russia has flatly rejected the idea of a diplomatic end to the hostilities. “The topic of negotiations at the moment has pretty much lost its relevance,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday, echoing a line that Kremlin officials have stuck to since Ukrainian forces began capturing parts of Kursk. It’s not clear what might get Russia to sit down and negotiate, though Jennifer Kavanagh, senior fellow and director of military analysis at Defense Priorities, a defense think tank, told Vox that there “could be an opportunity for one of these third parties” — such as India or Turkey, which have relationships with both Russia and Ukraine’s allies — “to play a big role” in the end of the war. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has so far refused to condemn Russia’s invasion, reportedly offered Ukraine help with negotiating an end to the fighting. Modi also reportedly told Putin Tuesday that he supported efforts for a peaceful, diplomatic resolution to the war — soon. It’s difficult to say what a diplomatic end to the war might look like, and Zelenskyy’s plan doesn’t offer any suggestions. But according to William Courtney, an adjunct senior fellow at RAND and a diplomat who served in Russia and eastern Europe, an end may not look like “total surrender” or a political settlement, but rather something like a sustained ceasefire. The danger with that arrangement, however, is that “Russians are notorious for violating their international commitment,” Courtney told Vox — meaning there’s no guarantee a ceasefire would be sustained. For now, however, any path to peace seems to lie at the end of more fighting. And that means despite the impressive Kursk push and Zelenskyy’s plan, the prospect of an imminent peaceful resolution looks dim.","summary":"Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced Tuesday that he has a new plan to end Russia’s years-long war on his country.

The first lady’s two sisters and her senior adviser Anthony Bernal joined them on the hot, sunny day. The group sat under two blue umbrellas. Some passers-by waved at them as they walked the beach. It’s day nine of the president’s two-week vacation. He often sits on the beach when he’s in Rehoboth. He had a blue bag with him and was seen removing a file folder stacked with papers. Biden arrived in Rehoboth Beach on Sunday after spending a week at an 8,000-acre ranch in Santa Ynez, California. He’ll be in Rehoboth until Monday, when he joins Kamala Harris in Pittsburgh for a campaign event. He’s preparing to get back into the swing of things. He’ll hit the road next week, heading to Wisconsin on Thursday to talk about his administration’s push to lower costs for Americans. Wisconsin in a critical battleground state for Democrats in the 2024 election. Biden is no longer on the ballot but can talk about what he and Kamala Harris have done to help the country. Democrats consider Wisconsin a must-win state. Meanwhile, the White House has defended Biden’s two-week break, saying he is in charge and running the country from his vacation locations. ‘The president is on vacation, but you can never unplug and from a job like that. Nor does he try to,’ National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Monday in a zoom briefing with reporters. ‘He’s very much in command,’ he noted of Biden. He pointed out Biden spoke with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday and talked to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday as proof the president is working. The White House has long argued Biden can perform the duties of president where ever he goes. When the president travels, a staff member on the National Security Council travels with him to keep him briefed on foreign affairs and a staffer in the chief of staff’s office is with him to keep him updated on domestic matters. Biden is on his 114th visit to Delaware spanning all or part of 328 days, according to journalist Mark Knoeller who tracks presidential travel. That is much more when compared to Donald Trump at a similar point in office: he spent 51 visits and 240 days at either of his estates in Mar-a-Lago, Fla., or Bedminster, N.J. It’s the second week in a row of downtime for the Bidens. They jetted off to Santa Ynez, California, on Monday night after Biden addressed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The couple – along with their children and grandchildren – stayed at a California ranch owned by Democratic donor billionaire Joe Kiani. The property sits about three hours north of Los Angeles in Santa Barbara wine country. Kiani has been a major donor to Biden’s campaigns and a friend to the family. Hunter Biden paid a visit to the $50 million vineyard property last year. Dubbed the ‘Kiani Preserve,’ the 8,000 acres has its own private vineyard, donkeys and a cattle herd. The vineyard on the property produces bottles of Shiraz and Cabernet Sauvignon, among other wines. The president doesn’t drink but the first lady is known to enjoy a glass or two of wine. Biden exited the presidential race on July 21 after his terrible debate performance against Donald Trump, which led to concerns about his mental abilities. ‘Over the next six months, I’ll be focused on doing my job as president,’ Biden said in his July 24 Oval Office address.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden appeared in public for the first time in three&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Biden spends time at the beach with Jill during his two-week break, following questions about White House leadership. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/biden-spends-time-at-the-beach-with-jill-during-his-two-week-break-following-questions-about-white-house-leadership/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Biden-hits-the-beach-with-Jill-on.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 22:58:27","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.006},{"id":255146328,"title":"Pro-Trump X Accounts Use Stolen Photos Of European Influencers: Study","text":"Meet \"Eva,\" \"Sophia,\" and \"Samantha\" -- fake accounts which pose as chic American women who support Donald Trump on the platform X, disguising themselves by using stolen photographs of European fashion and beauty influencers, according to a study published Wednesday.The report by the nonprofit Center for Information Resilience (CIR) comes as researchers express alarm ahead of the US election in November that the site owned by Elon Musk -- who has endorsed Trump -- is plagued with fake accounts and political disinformation.CIR said it uncovered 16 accounts that used images of European influencers -- without their permission -- to pose as young women promoting Trump and encouraging thousands of followers to vote for the Republican nominee.These accounts, which use stolen images of real people to appear authentic, were among 56 profiles that appear to be part of a coordinated campaign to push pro-Trump content, it added. \"By using images of the influencers, the accounts recognize the value of creating a believable human persona, steering clear of the generic photos and bot-like usernames usually associated with fake accounts,\" CIR's report said.It was unclear who was behind the digital deception or whether the accounts were pushing pro-Trump content for ideological or monetary gain.The fake profiles use everyday images from the influencers' Instagram accounts -- including pictures of them at the beach or walking their dog -- which are captioned with MAGA-related hashtags or pledges to vote for Trump, CIR said.MAGA, or Make America Great Again, is a political slogan associated with Trump and his campaign.Many of the accounts have attempted to spread misinformation about hot-button political subjects such as a recent assassination attempt against Trump, his Democratic rival Kamala Harris's ethnicity and US military aid to Ukraine, the report said.Some accounts also promote anti-vaccine and Covid-19 conspiracies, with some posts viewed hundreds of thousands of times.\"They post about divisive issues in US politics in a bid to exploit pre-existing tensions,\" the report said.One of the impersonators is \"Luna,\" a self-described 32-year-old \"MAGA Trump supporter,\" who used images of a German fashion influencer named Debbie Nederlof, according to CNN, which jointly conducted the investigation with CIR.Nederlof, a single mother, voiced anger and frustration over the misuse of her images, saying she had \"nothing to do with the United States, with Trump, the political things over there.\"\"What the hell do I -- from a small place in Germany -- care about US politics?\" she said.X did not respond to a request for comment.Impersonation is a violation of the platform's rules, and accounts posing as another person, group or organization may be \"permanently suspended,\" according to X's website.Musk appears to exert an outsized influence on US voters through the platform and his own personal account, which is regularly flagged by fact-checkers for spreading political falsehoods to his nearly 196 million followers.

At a campaign event in Erie, Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Vance slammed Harris for her use of teleprompters. “I don’t need a teleprompter, I’ve actually got thoughts in my head,” Vance told the crowd. “Unlike Kamala Harris.” Minutes later, Vance made a mistake while speaking, referring to Afghanistan’s Abbey Gate — where 13 American troops and 170 Afghan civilians died in a terrorist attack in August 2021 — as Abbey Road, the infamous Beatles album. Monday marked the third anniversary of the attack, which happened amid the Biden administration’s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021. “The families of these poor people who had their loved ones die three years ago at Abbey Road, they had to — I mean, Abbey Gate,” Vance said. The gaffe came as Vance answered a reporter’s question about a recent NPR report that claimed a Donald Trump campaign staffer verbally abused and pushed a cemetery official who tried to stop them from filming and photographing in Section 60, where troops who have recently died are buried. “There is verifiable evidence that the campaign was allowed to have a photographer there,” Vance said, just before his Abbey Gate mistake. “There’s verifiable they were invited to have a photographer there.” At the same event, Vance said Harris is “disgraceful” and can “go to Hell.” “Kamala Harris is so asleep at the wheel that she won’t even do an investigation into what happened and she wants to yell at Donald Trump because he showed up, she can go to Hell,” he said. Arlington National Cemetery confirmed in a previous statement to The Independent that “there was an incident, and a report was filed.” When previously reached for comment by The Independent, Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung denied that there was any physical altercation and vowed to release video to back up his claim. Meanwhile, an uptick in Trump-Vance campaign stops could come soon after CNN reported their team is taking on a new strategy. “Think Trump on steroids,” an unnamed campaign source told the network. “This is going to be an all-hands-on-deck approach.” The source also told the outlet Trump would visit two states per day, focusing on battleground areas.","summary":"Monday marked the third anniversary of the Abbey Gate terrorist attack that killed 13 Americans and 170 Afghans","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/vance-rips-harris-for-using-a-teleprompter-then-calls-afghanistan-s-abbey-gate-abbey-road-minutes-later-b2603474.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/28/22/GettyImages-2168129806.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/MI04lo0N-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-28 22:55:47","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":255147346,"title":"Maine granted $7.3 million for prenatal and postpartum home health care visits","text":"The federal Health Resources and Services Administration on Wednesday announced $7.3 million in funding for maternal, infant and early childhood home visiting services for certain families in Maine. The funds, administered as part of the national Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting Program, can be used to provide Mainers with home visits from nurses, social workers and other health care professionals as part of their prenatal and postpartum care. That includes help breastfeeding, encouraging safe sleeping practices, helping develop language and communication skills, developmental screenings and more, the administration said in a Wednesday release. This year’s funding represents a $1.3 million increase over last year’s, according to the release. The boost comes after President Biden signed legislation in 2022 that would double the program’s overall funding over five years – the program’s first expansion in nearly a decade, the administration said. Vice President Kamala Harris said the expanded funding – $440 million, all told – will help address “a maternal health crisis in which women across America are dying before, during, and after childbirth at higher rates than in any other developed nation.” In the release, Harris said the funding expansion builds on the Biden administration’s previous work to improve outcomes in maternal health care, citing a roadmap released in 2022. Xavier Becerra, secretary of Health and Human Services, said home visits can help improve school readiness and health outcomes for young children and their families. “Bringing home a baby can be stressful. Many new parents face additional challenges such as housing, or income insecurity, which can make the whole situation even more daunting,” Becerra said in the release. The money is being awarded to the state Department of Health and Human Services, according to the HRSA.","summary":"The funds can provide Mainers with home visits from nurses, social workers and other health care professionals as part of their prenatal and postpartum care.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2024/08/28/maine-granted-7-3-million-for-prenatal-and-postpartum-home-health-care-visits/","image":"https://www.centralmaine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/10/CMlogo_white.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 22:55:08","author":"Daniel Kool","authors":["Daniel Kool"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.475},{"id":255145480,"title":"Trump Blames Biden for Wars Abroad.

The event came a week after Democrats gathered in Chicago to nominate Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, and was the latest in a series of campaign events held in Maine since Harris took over the Democratic ticket from President Biden in late July. Maine House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, D-Portland, the first Black woman to serve as speaker of the Maine House, looked to capitalize on the energy from last week’s convention, which she described as life-changing. “It has reignited the fire in me – I’m sure like many others – to fight harder for the future we all believe in,” Talbot Ross said. Talbot Ross, who co-chairs Black Mainers for Harris-Walz, said the new group “creates a space for dialogue, organizing and action where Black Mainers can engage directly with a campaign that values us, that sees us and hears us and values diversity.” The Maine Department of the Secretary of State doesn’t have a breakdown of voter registrations by race, so it’s hard to say exactly how many Black voters there are in Maine. As of 2020, just under 3% of the state’s 1.3 million people identified as Black or African American, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Talbot Ross said it’s important for Black Mainers to know there are elected leaders in Maine fighting for a ticket that is committed to diversity and justice. Republican Donald Trump and his allies “are planning a massive expansion of presidential power” through Project 2025, Talbot Ross said. She said Trump’s election would undermine Black communities by repealing the Affordable Care Act, encouraging white supremacy and supporting policies that widen the racial wealth gap. “These are not the policies we want here in Maine, and we need to ensure that if that’s not what we want, we cannot stay on the sidelines,” she said. Project 2025 is a set of conservative policy proposals for a new Republican administration published by the conservative Heritage Foundation. Trump has tried to distance himself from its agenda, though critics have pointed to the involvement of his allies as evidence that the plan shows what a second Trump administration could look like. Trump has also said in the past that he would look at replacing the Affordable Care Act, though a campaign spokesperson told the New York Times earlier this month that Trump is not running to terminate the law and wants to “make health care actually affordable.” Janiyah Thomas, Team Trump’s Black media director, in response to questions about the Portland rally Wednesday, did not say specifically if Trump is planning any similar outreach with Black voters in Maine, but that the campaign “is going into deep blue cities and standing up grassroots engagement on a national platform.” “Black voters, like all voters, know that President Trump is the strongest candidate on the issues that matter to voters like the economy, immigration and inflation,” Thomas said in a statement. Wednesday’s Harris launch in Portland drew about 60 people as well as others who stopped to listen as they walked through the square at lunchtime. Talbot Ross was joined by several state and local officials; Shay Stewart-Bouley, a Peaks Island resident and the leader of an anti-racism organization; Black Mainers for Harris-Walz co-Chair Darmita Wilson; and U.S. Rep. Joyce Beatty, D-OH, all of whom spoke to the crowd. Beatty said she came to Maine as a Harris surrogate because “every vote, every voice counts” and that this year’s election is “the most consequential of our lifetimes.” “What we’re going to do is get people registered to vote and we’re going to go out and vote,” she said. Angela Franklin Lord, who lives in Cushing, drove nearly two hours to the rally after hearing about it from her state representative at a lobster bake last weekend. “I’ve never not voted for a Dem,” said Lord, adding that she agrees with Harris’ positions on reproductive rights, foreign policy and gun violence. “I’m just really inspired by her public service,” Lord said. Marcia Minter of Portland, who also attended the rally and is on the committee of Black Mainers for Harris-Walz, said she likes that the candidates “stand for true justice for all Americans.” She said she appreciated Wednesday’s rally being held. “Maine has that reputation that no Black people live here and that this is the whitest state,” Minter said. “We are very much here. We have always been here and we are a very active and close-knit community, and we want to make sure that is seen and heard.”","summary":"Maine House Speaker Rachel Talbot Ross, U.S. Rep.

Leatherby, the executive director of the Sacramento Life Center, found herself in the middle of a legislative and legal battle over the free-speech rights of pro-life pregnancy centers during Vice President Kamala Harris’ tenure as attorney general of California. From 2015 through mid-2018, Leatherby and others who ran pregnancy-resource centers fought against a state law that forced those pregnancy centers to display notices that include information about where women could obtain an abortion. “[This] went against everything we’re about — the reason we exist,” Leatherby said. “It went against our conscience.” The Reproductive FACT Act, of which Harris was a “proud” co-sponsor and the primary enforcer, compelled pro-life pregnancy centers licensed by the state to display notices about public programs in California, including “abortion for eligible women.” It required that they provide a phone number for the local county social services office so women could determine whether they were eligible for the government programs, such as subsidized abortion. Pro-life pregnancy centers provide hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of free services and resources to women who are pregnant and to mothers of young children. They often set up their operations near abortion centers to provide women with alternatives to abortion so they can have help in continuing their pregnancies. This includes free pregnancy services, such as ultrasounds and counseling, as well as material goods such as diapers and baby formula. Sacramento Life Center and more than 70 other pregnancy-resource centers that exclusively offered life-affirming pregnancy care were affected by the law mandating advertisements for abortion. Although the pro-life pregnancy centers joined together to lobby against the legislation, lawmakers passed the bill in 2015 with strong support among Democrats who were backed by pro-abortion organizations that often derided the services provided by the pregnancy centers. When the law went into effect on Jan. 1, 2016, pregnancy centers were forced to either display notices or face repeated fines: $500 for the first offense and $1,000 for all subsequent offenses. Leatherby said Sacramento Life Center refused to provide the notices at first, but after other clinics began receiving fines in Los Angeles, she said her pregnancy center complied with the law. “It was enforced and people came into our clinic to make sure we were posting [the notices] or we got written up in the papers as lawbreakers,” Leatherby said. The National Institute of Family and Life Advocates (NIFLA) — which represents numerous pro-life pregnancy centers in California and nationally — sued Harris’ office on allegations that the law violated the First Amendment by compelling speech. NIFLA was represented by Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF). The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ordered California to halt its enforcement of the law in June 2018, about a year and a half after Harris left office to serve as a senator. The law was initially defended in court by Harris’ office and then subsequently by her successor, Attorney General Xavier Becerra. “The law was designed to target pregnancy centers and coerce them to advertise for abortion,” ADF Senior Counsel Kevin Theriot, one of the lawyers who represented the pregnancy centers at the Supreme Court, told CNA. “It was clearly politically motivated to harm pregnancy centers because they don’t toe the line on their radical abortion agenda,” Theriot added. Five of the Supreme Court justices agreed, handing down a 5-4 decision that ordered California to stop enforcing the law based on First Amendment violations, finding that the law forced the pregnancy centers to provide a “government-drafted script” that compels them “to speak a particular message” on abortion. “By requiring [pro-life pregnancy centers] to inform women how they can obtain state-subsidized abortions — at the same time [that they] try to dissuade women from choosing that option — the licensed notice plainly alters the content of [their] speech,” Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the court’s majority opinion. Theriot said the effort to force pregnancy centers to advertise abortion was “weaponizing the law and the government against someone you don’t like because of their religious convictions and their pro-life views.” Specifically targeting the speech of pro-life pregnancy centers, he added, “was pretty unique when it was enacted in California” and promoted and enforced by Harris. “That was the beginning of quite a bit of discrimination against pro-life pregnancy centers,” Theriot said. Following in Harris’ footsteps, other states have tried to curtail the free-speech rights of pro-life pregnancy resource centers in other ways. This includes New York Attorney General Letitia James filing a lawsuit against pregnancy centers that accuses them of “false and misleading” speech and an Illinois law that attempted to restrict the speech pro-life pregnancy centers use in advertisements. Both efforts were halted by judges. Theriot said, “Other states have [since] been trying to target pregnancy centers and censor their speech on a regular basis.”","summary":"cna","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/cna/how-kamala-harris-targeted-pro-life-pregnancy-centers-in-california","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20220216210216_6409368b4bfd7d05a12711099ba87abdc71fca7485099ce153ed2feb4e5868d6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 22:42:04","author":"Tyler Arnold/cna","authors":["Tyler Arnold/cna"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.082},{"id":255145774,"title":"Biden spotted lounging on the beach for a second straight week of vacation: ‘This is absurd’","text":"Biden has been criticized for his long stretches of vacations along with a minimal work schedule as president since mid-July. The president has held a low-key presidential schedule since he tested positive for COVID-19 in July, following his announcement of withdrawing from the 2024 presidential election and endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris as front-runner for the Democratic Party ticket. Last week, he gave a speech Monday night at the Democratic National Convention that was delayed past prime-time hours of the convention. Immediately following his speech, the Biden family jetted off to California for a weeklong vacation at a billionaire donor’s 8,000-acre estate, dubbed the “Kiani Preserve,” in Santa Ynez, California. The president has been spending this week in Rehoboth Beach. “Who is running our country?” several social media users asked on Wednesday, reacting to video and photos of Biden on the beach. “Biden is now lounging on the beach during his SECOND STRAIGHT WEEK of vacations. This is ABSURD,” journalist Nick Sortor remarked. Newsmax White House correspondent James Rosen pressed White House national security spokesman John Kirby on Tuesday about the leadership of the country while Biden has been away from the White House. “The question I am hearing from the general public, which I put to you here, admiral, is ‘Who is running the country?'” Rosen asked. Kirby pushed back on the question: “President Joe Biden.” “Is he a ceremonial figure in some sense at this point?” Rosen inquired. “James, you know better than that. I mean, my goodness, he talked to Prime Minister Modi today and he had calls with leaders in the region and in Europe with President Zelensky last week. He monitored in real time what was going on over the weekend. I mean, come on,” the NSC spokesman said to Rosen, adding, “The president is on vacation, but you can never unplug from a job like that, nor does he try to. He’s very much in command of making sure we can continue to protect our national security interests here at home and certainly overseas.” Another person reacted on X to the Wednesday beach video of Biden, “We are paying Biden to do absolutely nothing.” “Joe is kicking back. It just goes to show that Biden has never been in control,” another commenter said on X. “Kamala told us at the DNC that he and [she] were working tirelessly to get those hostages home. Seems like he got tired and quit,” a social media user remarked on X. Tom Bevan, the publisher of RealClearPolitics, posted the president’s approval rating over the past few weeks in August. “Biden’s been on vacation for nearly a month since he dropped out. Here is his approval rating over the last 30 days,” Bevan said in a post with a picture of a graph showing that despite the criticisms of Biden’s empty work schedule, his approval numbers have stayed steady.

CNN, which scored the coveted interview, declined to comment on how the campaign presented a two-for-one situation to the network. CNN’s chief political correspondent and anchor Dana Bash will conduct the interview with Kamala Harris and Walz, which will be taped and is set to air at 9 p.m. ET on Thursday. The sit-down is Harris’ first opportunity since rising to the top of the Democratic ticket earlier this summer to show that she has the breadth of knowledge and confidence to be president—though given the build-up to this one interview and the lack of any others on the schedule, any single stumble will likely be amplified and replayed ad nauseum by the sophisticated Republican messaging machine. Both the Harris campaign and CNN declined to comment on questions about arrangements or contingencies that were set as part of the agreement to secure the first substantial interview that Harris has given since her rough performance in a sit-down with NBC’s Lester Holt in 2021. In announcing its selection by the Harris-Walz campaign, CNN touted its upcoming exclusive as just that: The First Interview: Harris & Walz A CNN Exclusive to air Thursday, Aug. 29, and stream live across the network’s platforms. It’s unclear how the campaign decided that Harris and Walz would do a joint interview in their first at-bat as official nominees. But one this is certain: the decision and the dynamics were set by the campaign, not by the network. “You’ll take whatever you can get right now from this campaign since there have been no interviews,” a former senior network television executive told the Daily Beast. Harris has come under scrutiny from her critics and the media for not giving unscripted media appearances, including news conferences and interviews. Republicans, from Donald Trump and JD Vance to conservative columnists and right-wing Twitter trolls, slammed Harris for choosing a network they’ve dubbed sympathetic and for taking her wingman, Walz, with her on the set. “Kamala is clearly scared to do an interview on her own and it's pre-taped so they can clean it up if things go badly,” the Trump-Vance campaign said in a statement, accusing the Democratic nominee of intentionally choosing the Thursday before Labor Day weekend when many may not be tuning in. Fox News’ Howie Kurtz says Harris is opening herself up to more attacks from the right, not fewer. He suggests she and Walz should have done separate interviews to mitigate the scrutiny. Harris and Walz on Wednesday afternoon began a bus tour through southern Georgia, which will conclude with a rally in Savannah on Thursday. The CNN interview is scheduled to be taped some time on Thursday in Savannah and clips of the interview may be released Thursday afternoon.","summary":"Elizabeth FrantzThe Harris campaign is declining to say why the Democratic presidential nominee has turned her long-awaited first media interview into a twofer with her running mate, Tim Walz, instead of doing a one-on-one.\n\nCNN, which scored the coveted interview, declined to comment on how the campaign presented a two-for-one situation to the network.

The city is dismantling the oldest sidewalk shed on public property – a rotting relic from 15-years ago when smartphones were cutting edge and Aaron Judge was in high school. But as the Adams administration continues a crack down on unsightly scaffolding across the five boroughs not everyone’s convinced the city should be taking a victory lap. “It’s been three mayors and three presidents since the scaffolding went up and finally came down. Only in New York City,” a City Council source told The Post Wednesday. “To put it into perspective, Kamala Harris was a District Attorney and Donald Trump was a reality star when this scaffolding first went up. A long, long time.” This infamous sidewalk shed has stifled 329 feet of sidewalk along First Avenue in front of the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner, where the city’s autopsies and forensic pathology is done. “The people who walk through the doors at OCME are frequently in profound need — or serve people who are,” Deputy Mayor for Operations Meera Joshi said at the site on Wednesday. “By maintaining this building we show respect to the work done inside, as we continue to fire on all cylinders to get sheds down.” The warped green, plywood and rusted metal poles darkening the Kips Bay neighborhood was removed by Department of Buildings workers this week, officials said. The soggy plywood was meant to protect pedestrians from unsafe building facade conditions contractors have now resolved, according to a DOB spokesperson. A dispute with the owner of a neighboring building delayed the needed repairs for years, a source told the Post. The effort is part of a city-wide initiative announced by Mayor Eric Adams last year called Get Sheds Down. It aims to make a dent in New York City’s 9,000 scaffolding sheds that have been up five years or longer. Councilwoman Gale Brewer, whose Upper West Side district is filled with sidewalk sheds, said it’s a “good sign” the city is removing the longest offenders on its own properties. “The city has to practice what it preaches by taking the sheds down,” Brewer told The Post. She said there’s a sidewalk at the Regent homeless shelter on the east side of 104th and Broadway “that’s been up forever.” “I get calls all the time. We send letters. Nothing happens.” Since the initiative started the city has removed 268 of the old plywood sheds across the five boroughs, 14 of them at city-owned properties, officials said. There are still 270 longstanding scaffolding sheds left in the city, according to DOB. The city is still assessing 43 other long standing scaffolding sheds on municipal properties that could be taken down once building repairs are complete while the DOB is working with building owners to remove sheds on private properties, according to DOB. The ubiquitous sheds linger because it’s often cheaper for a building owner to keep the scaffolding up than make repairs. Delays also come when there are disputes between owners and neighboring building tenants that delay facade repairs, the DOB said. A DOB spokesperson said the agency is working with building owners to provide technical assistance or to assess if a building owner can use façade containment netting instead, as was done at the Queens Supreme courthouse last summer. The mayor also directed the DOB to solicit six new scaffolding designs to make the necessary structures less of an eyesore. Those designs are expected to be completed and codified into law next year. Building owners who don’t take the example set by the city could find themselves in legal trouble. DOB is currently pursuing litigation against the owner of a building on Surf Avenue in Coney Island that had a scaffolding shed up for the last 18 years, according to a DOB official. Last December the city celebrated the teardown of a 21-year-old scaffolding shed in Inwood that came down only after the city filed criminal charges against the building’s owner for repeated failures to make repairs, according to a DOB source.","summary":"The Adams administration continues a crack down on unsightly scaffolding across the five boroughs not everyone's convinced the city should be taking a victory lap.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/28/us-news/nyc-tears-down-its-oldest-sidewalk-shed-but-some-wonder-what-took-so-long-only-in-new-york/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/88425970.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/01anG99L-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-28 22:36:35","author":"Carl Campanile,Craig McCarthy,Haley Brown","authors":["Carl Campanile","Craig McCarthy","Haley Brown"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":255144704,"title":"North Carolina Governor Race Shifts to Democrats in Two Election Forecasts","text":"Two election forecasters shifted North Carolina's gubernatorial race toward Democrats this week as polls show Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein building a lead over Republican Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson.North Carolina is a crucial swing state on the presidential level but is also home to perhaps the most hotly contested gubernatorial race of 2024. Incumbent Governor Roy Cooper, a Democrat, is unable to run for a third term due to term limits, and Democrats are increasingly optimistic about holding the executive office in the Tar Heel State.Robinson has faced scrutiny over his positions on issues like abortion and LGBTQ+ rights, which Democrats believe could alienate more moderate voters in the closely divided state. Recent polls suggest Stein may be favored, prompting two forecasters to give Democrats an advantage in their election ratings.Sabato's Crystal Ball reclassified the race as \"Leans Democrat\" from \"Toss-Up\" in an update published Wednesday by J. Miles Coleman and Kyle Kondik.They wrote that Robinson has made statements that are \"at a bare minimum, provocative and divisive,\" but Stein has \"generally avoided mentioning some of his opponent's more conspiratorial views, although he has highlighted some of Robinson's conservative statements on abortion.\"Robinson, meanwhile, has sought to \"soften his image,\" including by releasing an advertisement addressing his position on abortion, where Robinson and his wife Yolanda discuss their experiences with abortion. The candidate said he supports the state's current laws, which allow abortion for up to 12 weeks and \"common sense exemptions\", saying in the advert, \"Thirty years ago, my wife and I made a very difficult decision,\" he said. \"It was like a silent pain between us that we never spoke of.\" His wife, Yolanda Robinson, said in the commercial that having an abortion is \"something that stays with you forever.\"Robinson has used words like \"filth\" and \"maggots\" when talking about the LGBTQ+ community and said in 2019 that mass shootings were \"karma\" for American's support of abortion rights. He also sparked criticism after saying Black Americans are not owed reparations for slavery, saying, \"If you want to tell the truth about it, it is YOU who owes!\"Jeff Allen, Stein's campaign manager, responded to the shifts in a statement to Newsweek on Wednesday.\"Voters across North Carolina are learning about the contrast between Josh Stein and Mark Robinson. Josh fights for people; Mark Robinson fights job-killing culture wars. But make no mistake: this race will be very close. Our campaign is working hard to earn every vote and make sure people know that as Governor, Josh Stein will build a safer, stronger North Carolina,\" he said.Newsweek also reached out to the Robinson campaign for comment via email.\"Though North Carolina is in our Toss-up column at the presidential level, it is almost certainly more of a 'must win' state for Donald Trump than it is for Kamala Harris—so as Election Day nears, increasing Republican investment could help Robinson close the gap. But we also feel that, as most recent Democratic nominees for governor in the state have done, Stein is also positioned to outperform the top of the ticket,\" Coleman and Kondik wrote.On Tuesday, the Cook Political Report also moved the race from a toss-up to \"Leans Democratic.\"Recent polls recently showed Stein leading Robinson. A SurveyUSA/High Point University poll showed Stein with a 14-point advantage (50 percent to 36 percent). The poll surveyed 941 likely voters from August 19 to August 21.Elsewhere, a New York Times/Siena College poll, conducted among 655 likely voters from August 9 to August 14, found Stein leading by 10 points (49 percent to 39 percent).An ActiVote poll, conducted among 400 likely voters from July 26 to August 26, found Stein leading by 8 points (54 percent to 46 percent).","summary":"Democratic Attorney General Josh Stein has gained ground against GOP Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, according to recent polls.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/north-carolina-governor-race-shifts-democrats-1945828","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2459996/north-carolina-attorney-general-josh-stein.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 22:31:16","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.231},{"id":255145834,"title":"Trump Posts TikTok From Controversial Visit to Arlington National Cemetery","text":"Donald Trump posted a TikTok of his visit to Arlington National Cemetery, stoking further controversy about whether he should have filmed on the hallowed grounds or not. Trump, 78, slyly criticized Joe Biden’s administration without mentioning the president or Kamala Harris by name. The 21-second video features a Trump voiceover as he stands by gravesites, visits with Gold Star families, and lays a wreath at a memorial. “We lost 13 great, great people,” Trump says in the clip. “What a horrible day it was. We didn’t lose one person in 18 months and then they took over that disaster, the leaving of Afghanistan.” Trump has been criticized for appearing to politicize his visit to honor soldiers who were killed three years ago by a suicide bomber in Afghanistan during the U.S.’s chaotic withdrawal from the country. Biden and Harris did not attend Monday’s event. The controversy around Trump’s visit escalated Tuesday evening when reports emerged that someone in his camp got into an “altercation” with a top cemetery official who objected to the campaign filming his visit. Trump’s spokespeople have claimed they were given permission to film ahead of the visit and confirmed that an incident took place. NPR reported the clash got physical in Section 60, a 14-acre area where U.S. service members killed in Iraq and Afghanistan are laid to rest. The Trump campaign denied that the altercation escalated beyond words in a statement to the Daily Beast, however. “There was no physical altercation as described and we are prepared to release footage if such defamatory claims are made,” campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said. He did not respond to the Daily Beast or NPR’s request to share the footage. “The fact is that a private photographer was permitted on the premises and for whatever reason an unnamed individual, clearly suffering from a mental health episode, decided to physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony,” Cheung said. Arlington National Cemetery, located just outside of the nation’s capital, is the largest resting place for U.S. soldiers killed in action and war veterans. It’s long had strict rules in place that orders politicians to not politicize their visits to the sacred site. Criticism of Trump’s visit has largely been on party lines, but some of those bashing him have come from the right. That includes Adam Kinzinger, a former Republican lawmaker who’s a lieutenant colonel in the Air National Guard, who skewered Trump for recording at the cemetery and for smiling next to soldiers’ graves. “Donald Trump is a disgrace to our nation, and to Arlington National Cemetery,” Kinzinger said. “To politicize that visit without regard for the rules is just par for the course from this sick man and his tiny minions.”","summary":"Anna Moneymaker/Getty ImagesDonald Trump posted a TikTok of his visit to Arlington National Cemetery, stoking further controversy about whether he should have filmed on the hallowed grounds or not.\n\nTrump, 78, slyly criticized Joe Biden’s administration without mentioning the president or Kamala Harris by name.

Pat Ryan taunted as ‘Sanctuary Pat’ by opponent years after issuing order to block cooperation with ICE","text":"New York Rep. Pat Ryan is being taunted as “Sanctuary Pat” years after the Democrat issued a local order that blocked cooperation with federal immigration officials during the Trump administration. The Hudson Valley politician was serving as Ulster County executive in 2019 when he signed an executive order that banned county law enforcement and other workers from sharing certain information with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and US Customs and Border Patrol unless their request came with a court order. Ryan is the latest Democratic official forced to answer for politically charged pro-migrant policies that came at a time when liberals were pushing against what was viewed as a hard-line deportation policy from then-President Donald Trump. But as Ryan seeks reelection in the swing 18th District, the executive order could be unpopular among voters turned off by the massive border crossings under the Harris-Biden administration that has triggered a migrant crisis in New York. “Under Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, and Sanctuary Pat Ryan, every town has become a border town,” Republican opponent Alison Esposito’s campaign said in a statement. “Here in the Hudson Valley, thousands of miles away from our Southern border, migrant crime has rocked our communities,” the statement went on. “Not only has Pat Ryan refused to act to make our communities safer, he proudly supports the open border and sanctuary policies that have made our lives less safe.” Esposito, a former NYPD deputy inspector who ran as the 2022 GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, accused Ryan of being soft on illegal immigration and created a taunting website called “Sanctuary Pat.” Ryan’s June 26, 2019 executive order said, “No officer or employee of any county department including law enforcement officers shall disclose information to federal immigration authorities for the purpose of federal civil immigration enforcement, unless required by law.” “Absent a lawfully issued judicial warrant, no officer or employee of any county department shall provide ICE or CBP with access to an individual in their custody, or the use of office facilities to question or interview such individuals if ICE’s or CBP’s sole purpose is enforcement of federal immigration law.” Ryan railed against anticipated “mass deportation raids“ and “xenophobia” when announcing the executive order. “We are a nation of immigrants ….in Ulster County, we know that compassion, respect and justice are the proper pathways to a stronger and healthier community,” he said. “This Executive Order ensures that we all continue to uphold those values in order to ensure that all residents are treated equally and with the respect and legal protections they deserve, regardless of their immigration status.” Ryan’s campaign on Wednesday defended his record on border security. “Pat has the strongest record on border security in this race,” Ryan spokesman Sam Silverman said. “Pat led a bipartisan effort with Congressmen [Mike] Lawler and [Marc] Molinaro calling on President Biden to declare a state of emergency in New York in response to the migrant crisis, was one of only 15 Democrats to demand President Biden take executive action to restore order at the border, and has gotten multiple pieces of border legislation signed into law, including the `Securing America’s Borders Against Fentanyl Act and the `Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act. “Unfortunately, this is an uncomfortable reality for Alison, who opposed the strongest border security legislation in decades, so she’s desperately searching for any opportunity to score cheap political points to salvage her failing campaign,” Silverman said, referring to a stalled border security bill backed by Biden and Democrats and blocked by Republicans earlier this year. “Alison can spend her time politicizing the border; Pat is doing the actual work to fix it.”","summary":"New York Rep.

Kamala doesn’t need the energy delivery as much right now,” Paul Mitchell, a Democratic consultant and California-based political data expert, told Politico this week. In a flurry of interviews and battleground events for Biden before the president dropped his reelection bid in July, Newsom proved himself to be one of his chief champions. Whether in Michigan or Pennsylvania, on Fox News or CNN, the California Democrat expressed enthusiasm for keeping Biden in the White House. “I will never turn my back on President Biden,” he said just a few short weeks before the president’s historic campaign exit. Newsom’s devotion to the president even attracted criticism that his role as top Biden surrogate was hindering him from governing California. “Our budget’s upside down. We have businesses leaving California. You can’t afford to live here, and so those are all things that obviously we need to work on here, and he’s not here to work on those,” Californian state Sen. Brian Dahle, who ran against Newsom during the special recall election in 2022, told Fox Digital last month. After Harris’s swift ascent to the top of the Democratic ticket, Newsom might have more time to spend in his home state. The California governor appears to have taken a backseat in promoting his former colleague, despite claims that he’s “totally focused the next 70 odd days on electing VP Harris,” in comments to Politico. A host of top Democrats delivered prime-time speeches in support of Harris during last week’s Democratic National Convention. Newsom was not one of them, making only brief remarks from the floor on the second evening of the event. Newsom’s office said the governor had been approached with a prime-time slot but refused because of a previous commitment. Meanwhile, his remarks during an interview last Friday, joking about the “inclusive process” Harris underwent to replace Biden, didn’t help speculation that the pair’s relationship lacks warmth. Questioned on how he felt about “the switch” at the top of the Democratic ticket, Newsom quipped, “We went through a very open process, a very inclusive process. It was bottom-up. I don’t know if you know that. “That’s what I’ve been told to say,” he laughed during comments to Pod Save America. Newsom and Harris were Democratic colleagues in California for years. The two ran parallel careers in San Francisco, with Newsom becoming mayor and Harris district attorney, in 2003. In the following years, Newsom rose to prominence as the Golden State’s lieutenant governor and then governor, while Harris became California’s Democratic attorney general. While Newsom was widely rumored to hold presidential ambitions, he never said he would challenge Harris. A heartbeat away from the presidency, Harris easily emerged as the front-runner to become her party’s presidential nominee after Biden made his campaign exit. While Newsom could be found anywhere and everywhere rooting for Biden, these days, Harris surrogates, such as Govs. Josh Shapiro (D-PA) and Andy Beshear (D-KY), have been the major players in supporting the vice president.","summary":"Gov.

In the brief unsigned order, the court said it \"expected that the Court of Appeals will render its decision with appropriate dispatch.\" The order had no public dissents. \"The Supreme Court unanimously upheld our court order blocking Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's illegal student loan cancellation scheme,\" Missouri attorney general Andrew Bailey wrote Wednesday in a post on X. \"This is a huge victory for the working Americans who won't have to foot the bill for the Biden-Harris Ivy League bailout,\" he added. The Supreme Court order was in response to the Justice Department's emergency appeal after a federal appeals court blocked the program, known as the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, Plan last month. The Biden administration vowed Wednesday to fight on. \"Our administration will continue to aggressively defend the SAVE Plan -- which has helped over 8 million borrowers access lower monthly payments, including 4.5 million borrowers who have had a zero dollar payment each month. And, we won't stop fighting against Republican-elected officials' efforts to raise costs on millions of their own constituents' student loan payments,\" a White House spokesperson said in response to the order. In July, the St. Louis-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted the request by seven GOP-led states to block further loan forgiveness, stating that the Department of Education had exceeded its authority in setting repayment terms. The Biden administration then turned to the Supreme Court with an emergency intervention to temporarily lift the order. \"The states fail to justify allowing that extraordinary injunction to continue to harm millions of borrowers while this appeal is litigated,\" U.S. Solicitor Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in court filings before the justices rejected the request Wednesday that would have allowed the program to continue during appeal. Under the SAVE Plan, monthly payments and debt would be reduced for certain borrowers at a cost of hundreds of billions of dollars over the next 10 years. The Education Department already had granted $5.5 billion in relief to 414,000 borrowers before the program was put on hold. The Education Department estimates it has forgiven $168 billion in debt for more than 4.7 million Americans. It estimates the SAVE plan would cost nearly $156 billion over a decade. As litigation continues, SAVE Plan borrowers are not required to pay principal or interest as Biden administration lawyers argue that the \"extraordinary injunction has scrambled the department's administration of loans for millions of borrowers,\" creating \"widespread confusion and uncertainty.\" The White House has repeatedly pushed its program to cancel student debt despite hitting legal roadblocks. Last summer, the Supreme Court rejected Biden's plan that would have offered up to $20,000 in student loan relief to millions of borrowers. In February, the White House announced a new plan that would have gone into effect July 1. Two federal judges blocked parts of that plan one week earlier. In Missouri, a judge ruled the administration \"lacks the authority\" to forgive loans as part of the Income-Contingent Repayment plan and that doing so would \"likely harm Missouri\" by cutting into administrative fees. A judge in Kansas blocked parts of the plan in June as both states also filed separate lawsuits. Kansas Attorney General Kris Kobach accused the Biden administration of illegally bypassing Congress and forcing taxpayers to pay off the student loans of other Americans. \"Blue-collar Kansas workers who didn't go to college shouldn't have to pay off the student loans of New Yorkers with gender studies degrees,\" he said.","summary":"The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday rejected the Biden administration's request to cancel student debt for millions of borrowers during an appeals process, as Republican-led states challenge its legality.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/28/supreme-court-rejects-restart-student-loan-program/9571724880063/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/9571724880063/2024/upi/6aa9f2bed8f4c9b57d189052fe734e0b/v1.2/Supreme-Court-rejects-Biden-administrations-plea-to-restart-student-loan-debt-relief.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 22:17:57","author":"Sheri Walsh","authors":["Sheri Walsh"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.609},{"id":255144400,"title":"'American Nostradamus' Trump Uses Apocalypse/Doomsday Predictions When He's Losing: Columnist","text":"Columnist Aaron Blake recently pointed out how former President Donald Trump seemed to shift to a doomsday narrative when he felt threatened or defeated in a political argument. In a Washington Post op-ed, Blake cited several instances to prove his point. For instance in a heated crackdown on his political rival, Vice President Kamala Harris, the ex-POTUS once claimed that Harris would 'obliterate' Social Security and Medicare, and 'destroy' the US. Trump also claimed that she could even 'ban' crude oil. In an apparently fear-mongering tweet, Trump penned, \"There will be no future under Comrade Kamala Harris because she will take us into a Nuclear World War III!\" However, the predictions made by him haven't exactly turned out to be anywhere near accurate. As such, Blake noted, \"But if you are looking for your own personal American Nostradamus, you might want to look elsewhere. Trump’s prognostications on this front have regularly proved wrong.\" Furthermore, the journalist showed how some of these statements used to bash Harris were also used for President Joe Biden when he was the presumed Democrat frontrunner. Blake pointed to the time when the ex-POTUS quoted the catastrophic end of the American economy under the Democratic government. In 2020, according to Raw Story, Trump stated that under Biden, gas would reach $6 or $7. When it didn't, Trump then claimed it would climb as high as $9. In another fake scenario, the businessman-turned-politician claimed that in 2020, China would 'own' the United States. He also feared that the Democrats would remove the Second Amendment. However, none of that took place under the Biden administration. Moreover, seemingly spewing fear among his supporters, Trump warned about the future of the stock market and predicted the state of the economy could be the 'new great depression' if he is not elected. \"We will go into a depression, no different than — maybe worse — no different than what happened in 1929. Your stocks will crash, and your 401(k)s will be worthless. This is going to happen,\" Trump said in August 2020. Similarly, in October of that year, during a debate, he asserted, \"You will have a depression, the likes of which you’ve never seen. Your 401(k)s will go to hell and it’ll be a very, very sad day for this country.\" Speaking about quarantine and lockdowns back when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the globe, he stressed that Biden would cease all developments. \"If you vote for Biden, it means no kids in school, no graduations, no weddings, no Thanksgiving, no Christmas, and no Fourth of July together.\" However, that was not the case at all as the lockdowns were lifted partially from time to time.","summary":"The columnist cited instances when Trump quoted the catastrophic end of the US economy under the Democratic government as a fearmongering tactic.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/american-nostradamus-trump-uses-apocalypse-doomsday-predictions-when-hes-losing-columnist","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/712773/uploads/2bec5a90-6461-11ef-b8c0-ff760e84a981_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 22:15:00","author":"INQUISITR,Tavishi","authors":["INQUISITR","Tavishi"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":255143942,"title":"Ken Paxton May Have 'Chilling Effect' on Ted Cruz Election: Analyst","text":"Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton's recent raids, ordered as part of his ongoing election integrity investigation, could hurt his fellow Republican, Senator Ted Cruz.Paxton announced last week that his Election Integrity Unit executed multiple search warrants after receiving allegations of voter fraud.On Tuesday, the nation's oldest Latino civil rights groups raised an alarm that several of its members had their homes raided as part of Paxton's investigation. The League of United Latin American Citizens asked the Justice Department to investigate the raids, calling the attorney general's actions \"point blank voter intimidation.\"\"LULAC will fight for the right of every Latino to exercise the right to vote,\" Roman Palomares, the group's national president, said at a Monday press conference outside Paxton's office in San Antonio.Although the Lone Star State was never going to be in play for Vice President Kamala Harris (Texas has not elected a Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter in 1976), the raids conducted by Paxton's office and the allegations lobbied by Latino voting groups raise questions about what this means for the state's Senate race.Democrats are hoping to flip the seat currently held by Senator Ted Cruz in November, electing state Representative Colin Allred in his place.The race is currently ranked \"likely Republican\" by the Cook Political Report, but recent polls suggest Allred could catch up to Cruz. A YouGov/University of Houston poll released last week showed Allred trailing behind his Republican opponent by just 2 points. In June, the incumbent had been up 3 points.The allegations being lobbied at Paxton could mean another boost may be on the horizon for Allred.\"These raids will absolutely have a chilling effect on the Latino vote in South Texas,\" Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor specializing in Texas politics at the University of Houston, told Newsweek.\"Allred is already struggling with the Latino vote, and big turnout in these communities may very well be the difference,\" Rottinghaus said.Newsweek reached out to Cruz's reelection campaign via email for comment.Latino voters only favor Allred over Cruz by a margin of six points, according to a poll conducted by the University of Houston's Hobby School of Public Affairs and Texas Southern University earlier this month. Comparably, female voters prefer Allred by seven points. Gen Z voters favor Allred by 27 percent, and Black voters favor Allred by 52 percent.Texas Hispanics hit a major milestone in 2021 when Latinos officially became the largest share of the state's population, narrowly outnumbering white residents by 40.2 percent to 39.8 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\"Turnout in the Latino community is the most important challenging part of Democrats winning elections in Texas,\" Rottinghaus said. \"If the numbers from these communities is low, so the chances for Democrats to win state-wide.\"Joshua Blank, research director of the Texas Politics Project, was more skeptical about Paxton's raids boosting voter turnout.\"Historically, actions that can be described as hostile to Latino voting have done little to impact their perceptions about the voting process in the state,\" Blank told Newsweek.\"Ultimately, there are larger factors at play with respect to Latino turnout, with both parties, but especially the GOP, in recent years attempting to make inroads among Hispanic voters, particularly in South Texas,\" he said. \"It's notable that Attorney General Paxton has taken the lead on this issue at the moment given that he is not on the ballot again until 2026.\"Blank added that while playing up suspicions of voter fraud is a common tactic for Texas Republicans, \"Cruz has tried to strike a much more pragmatic tone in this campaign, painting himself as something of a great compromiser despite his history as unbending on the immigration issue.\"\"Anything that inhibits the right of any member of a minority group to vote in Texas jeopardizes Allred's chances of winning,\" political consultant Jay Townsend told Newsweek. \"Paxton knows this, and it should surprise no one that he would do all in his power to discourage Hispanics from voting or claim fraud if they do.\"","summary":"Could AG Ken Paxton's recent raids on Latino civil rights activists hurt Senator Ted Cruz's reelection chances?","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/ken-paxton-raids-ted-cruz-reelection-chances-texas-1945773","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2460005/ted-cruz-ken-paxton.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-28 22:12:49","author":"Katherine Fung","authors":["Katherine Fung"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.257}]}
