When President Biden stepped aside under pressure from his own party earlier this month, Harris rapidly ascended to become the presumptive nominee. Harris has since enjoyed a honeymoon period from her party and from some in the media, but Carville warned Democrats the honeymoon will come to an end. Carville warned Democrats that while the GOP was initially caught off-guard, this will be no easy victory for her campaign as Republicans adapt. “I think that she has a record, she’s going to have to come up with some proposals. But I think a lot of it is going to depend on her ability to define herself, and I actually think she’s going to have to introduce herself, because she’s really not that well known,” Carville said on an episode of “Firing Line With Margaret Hoover” PBS released over the weekend. He later suggested that “Republicans are going to try to introduce her on their terms. I don’t blame them. I would do the same thing. And she’s going to have to get good fast.” He added, “That’s all I can say. And I’m not very giddy about this, I’m not cocky at all, I think we have a tough election ahead of us.” When asked by the interviewer how Harris will be able to “sustain this excitement” throughout the rest of her campaign, Carville said that she must have a deep understanding of why her rise was such a relief to her party in the first place. “That’s the key question. The first thing is to recognize what happened. What happened was that people wanted something different, and that she just projects the fact that she is, you know, excited about the future. And there was no policy that anyone was pushing, there was no particular group that was behind this,” he said. “It was just a general feeling that people wanted a different choice than Donald Trump and President Biden, and they got it.” He reiterated his warning that Republicans are preparing a strategy to attack her credibility as a candidate, and her campaign should not underestimate their ability to do so. “Look, she’s going to get slaughtered, they’re coming, and this is just part of — no different than it was any other time. And they have got to get up and get ready and they’ve got to be able to defend and attack at the same time,” he said. “There’s going to be a time of struggle and definition as to who Vice President Harris is, and we better be ready for that. But I feel like we are in a better position today than we were Sunday morning, and we’re doing this interview on Wednesday. So I will take small victories where I get them.”","summary":"\"I think a lot of it is going to depend on her ability to define herself, and I actually think she’s going to have to introduce herself, because she’s really not that well known,\" Carville said on an episode of \"Firing Line With Margaret Hoover\" PBS released over the weekend.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/democratic-strategist-james-carville-warns-vp-harris-is-gonna-get-slaughtered/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/democratic-strategist-james-carville-warned-86481738.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/T2fRt1Fz-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-31 00:03:57","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.105},{"id":253010298,"title":"Whoopi Goldberg tells 'The View' she feels sorry for 'poor guy' JD Vance: 'I pity this man'","text":"Whoopi Goldberg, told her co-hosts on \"The View\" that 1980s actor Mr. T’s iconic phrase \"I pity the fool\" summarizes how she feels about former President Trump’s vice president pick Sen.

The strike in the Lebanese capital killed at least one woman and two children and wounded dozens of people. Hezbollah did not immediately confirm the commander’s death. The strike came amid escalating hostilities with the Lebanese militant group. An Israeli official said the target was Fouad Shukur, a top Hezbollah military commander whom the U.S. blames for planning and launching the deadly 1983 Marine bombing in the Lebanese capital. An Israeli official said the target was Fouad Shukur, a top Hezbollah military commander whom the U.S. blames for planning and launching the deadly 1983 Marine bombing in the Lebanese capital. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the details of the strike with the media. Shukur is also suspected in other strikes that killed Israeli civilians. Though Hezbollah issued a rare denial of involvement in the rocket attack Saturday in the town of Majdal Shams, Israel is holding the militant group responsible. “Hezbollah crossed a red line,” Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant posted on the platform X shortly after Tuesday’s strike. The two sides have exchanged near-daily strikes for the past 10 months against the backdrop of the war in Gaza, but they have previously kept the conflict at a low level that was unlikely to escalate into full-on war. Lebanon’s public health ministry said Tuesday’s strike in a southern suburb of Beirut wounded 74 people, some of them seriously. The wounded were taken to nearby hospitals. Bahman Hospital near the site of the blast called for blood donations. Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency reported that the strike was carried out with a drone that launched three rockets. “The Israeli enemy has committed a great stupid act in size, timing and circumstances by targeting an entirely civilian area,” Hezbollah official Ali Ammar told Al-Manar TV. “The Israeli enemy will pay a price for this sooner or later.” Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati condemned the Israeli attack, saying it hit a few meters from one of the largest hospitals in the capital. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not immediately release a statement, but minutes after the strike sent a photo of the prime minister with his national security adviser and other officials. The airstrike on Beirut’s southern suburb of Haret Hreik — a crowded urban neighborhood where Hezbollah has political and security operations but which is also full of small shops and apartment buildings — damaged several buildings. It was not immediately clear if any Hezbollah official was hit, a Hezbollah official said. A Lebanese military intelligence official said they had no information when asked by The Associated Press whether a senior Hezbollah security official had escaped the airstrike. Both officials spoke on condition of anonymity in accordance with regulations. The strike hit an apartment building near to a hospital, collapsing half of the targeted building and severely damaging one next to it. The hospital sustained minor damages, while the surrounding streets were littered with debris and broken glass. A forklift was in the middle of the street, reaching to the top floors of the destroyed building, while utility crews removed fallen power lines. Crowds gathered to inspect the damage and check on their families. Some of them chanted in support of Hezbollah. Paramedics could be seen carrying several wounded people out of the damaged buildings. A resident of the suburb whose home is about 200 meters (yards) away said that dust from the explosion “covered everything,” and that the glass in his son’s apartment was broken. “Then people went down on the streets,” he said. “Everyone has family. They went to check on them. It was a lot of destruction.” He spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern about his security at a tense moment. Hassan Noureddine said he was riding his motorcycle near the building when he heard the sound of two explosions. “It looked like a strike from a drone and not a jet,” Noureddine told the AP near the site of the attack. Despite fears of escalation and a strike in recent days, Noureddine said that he and other people he knows in the area are not fazed and that their spirits are high. Talal Hatoum, a local official with the Shiite Amal Movement, Hezbollah’s key political ally in Lebanon, said Tuesday’s attack marked a shift in the rules of engagement in the conflict because it caused a significant number of civilian casualties. The last time Israel targeted Beirut was in January, when an airstrike killed a top Hamas official, Saleh Arouri. That strike was the first time Israel had hit Beirut since the 34-day war between Israel and Hezbollah in the summer of 2006. Israel had been expected to retaliate for the strike in Majdal Shams, but diplomats had said in recent days that they expected the response to stay within the boundaries of the ongoing low-level conflict between Hezbollah and Israel without provoking all-out war. Many of them had not expected that Israel would hit Beirut, which might elicit a strike by Hezbollah on a major population center in Israel. The United Nations’ special coordinator for Lebanon, Jeanine Hennis-Plasschaert, said in a statement that she was “deeply concerned” by the strike and called for “calm to prevail.” U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said Israel “has the right to defend itself against the terrorist organization,” referring to Hezbollah, but added, “We still must work on a diplomatic solution to end these attacks, and we will continue to do that work.” Goldenberg reported from Tel Aviv, Israel.

There are reforms that would make the institution more politicized — and then there are reforms that would make it less politicized. Encouragingly, Mr. Biden apparently favors some that move in the right direction. Before Mr. Biden withdrew his candidacy, The Post reported that he had two proposals in mind: First, establish an enforceable ethics code for the justices; second, subject them to term limits. Each idea presents constitutional issues. It is not clear if life tenure for members of the federal judiciary can be changed through ordinary legislation or would require constitutional amendment. Similarly, any effort by Congress to impose a binding ethics code on the Supreme Court could violate the separation of powers. For now, though, it’s enough to consider reform suggestions on their merits, which are real. We have long supported Supreme Court term limits. In part, this is because they are preferable to a more radical alternative progressives have been trying to push on Mr. Biden since the beginning of his presidency: to increase the court’s size and “pack” it with ideologically friendly appointees. The origins of this movement lie in Democrats’ understandable ire over the recent history of appointments. Senate Republicans managed to solidify a GOP-appointed majority for the foreseeable future by refusing to consider one of President Barack Obama’s nominees months before the 2016 election, then fast-tracking President Donald Trump’s pick under similar circumstances in 2020. The court has frequently ruled the way Republicans wanted, on everything from abortion to federal regulation. But packing the court would answer Republican politicization with Democratic politicization. The point is to make the judiciary less of a partisan playground. Term limits would help achieve that. One reason Supreme Court nomination battles are so intense is because the stakes are so high. People live a lot longer than they did when the Framers wrote life tenure for judges into the Constitution — to protect the courts against undue influence. Nowadays, a president elected to a single four-year term can influence the judiciary’s course for a generation. An 18-year term for justices, however, would fit better with the periods their presidential and congressional counterparts serve. If terms on the court were staggered, coming open every four or so years, it would be rarer for a president to install a disproportionate number. Conversely, winning the presidency more often would — appropriately — mean more appointments for a more popular party over time. Justices would feel less pressure to time their retirements based on partisan control of the presidency or Senate. And senators would have less reason to vote against qualified nominees for fear that their choices could doom their legislative agendas for decades. The idea of an ethics code arises from recent scandals over the failure of the court’s existing self-regulation system. Justice Clarence Thomas took luxury vacations funded by a high-dollar GOP donor without reporting them on financial disclosure forms; Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. was also reticent about his travel to an Alaskan fishing lodge on the dime of a hedge fund executive whose firm had business before the court. The involvement of Justice Thomas’s wife in “Stop the Steal” efforts after the 2020 election also raised eyebrows. Neither justice recused from arguably related proceedings, though eventually — begrudgingly — Justice Thomas, without admitting any ethical lapse, produced more forthcoming reports. (Justice Alito insisted in op-eds that he had disclosed everything the rules require.) This debacle pointed to the need for greater clarity as to the types of gifts that require disclosure, as well as what fundraising activities are appropriate, which the court, belatedly, provided. What’s still lacking is an enforcement mechanism, which could be hard to design without intruding on the judicial branch’s independence. The president’s forthcoming proposal ought to contribute to that debate by suggesting not only a set of standards to which the court ought to be held but also a system for holding them to it that could pass constitutional muster. One possibility is to keep that system within the judicial branch, by giving the job to retired federal judges whom justices could at least consult regarding their ethical responsibilities. Now that Mr. Biden is no longer a candidate, there is less chance that his proposals can be dismissed as an election-year gambit. Certainly, he should write them as if that’s true; members of the legislative and judicial branches should treat them in the same spirit, too. ONLINE: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2024/07/26/biden-supreme-court-term-limits-ethics/ ___ July 26 The New York Times on debates, transparency in the current election cycle Vice President Kamala Harris, now the likely Democratic nominee, has the chance to encourage and embrace the kind of close examination that the public so far has had little opportunity to witness during the 2024 race. Americans deserve a campaign that tests the strengths and weaknesses of the candidates; that highlights their differences and allows scrutiny of their plans; that motivates people to vote by giving them a clear account of how their choice in this election will affect their lives. Americans deserve the opportunity to ask questions of those who are seeking to lead their government. There are promising signs in the early days of Ms. Harris’s candidacy. She has bounced onto the campaign trail with a sense of joyful purpose, seizing the opening to reintroduce herself. She has begun to detail the dangers of a second Trump presidency and to delineate her differences with Donald Trump, while describing her vision for a country where people have the support they need to prosper. But she needs to do more, and she needs to do it quickly. Ms. Harris ought to challenge Mr. Trump to a series of debates or town halls on subjects of national importance, such as the economy, foreign policy, health care and immigration. Mr. Trump claims that he is ready and willing to participate in debates once Democrats have officially selected a nominee. Americans would benefit from comparing the two candidates directly. Both candidates need to start taking questions from reporters, too. Candidates have abundant opportunities to speak directly to voters, through social media and tightly controlled public appearances, without the mediation of journalists. Most voters, however, will never be able to speak directly with candidates. President Biden has rarely granted the news media permission to ask questions on behalf of the American people, and on the rare occasions he did, his team sometimes sent scripted questions. It left him poorly prepared for the campaign trail and for confronting his opponent. Mr. Trump, too, rarely takes questions. Ms. Harris has the chance to do better. Engaging with voters is especially important for Ms. Harris because she would be the first major-party presidential candidate in modern times who did not pass through the state primary process, in which voters have a chance to take the measure of candidates and to ask questions about the issues that matter most to their communities. Ms. Harris’s candidacy does not require legitimation. She is the clear choice of her party. An Ipsos poll this week found that 89 percent of Democrats supported her running as the party’s nominee. But addressing small crowds in small places and answering questions from local reporters are rituals during the primaries for a reason. Unlike large public rallies, they are occasions for encounters on equal footing, and they are an education for the candidate as much as for voters. With debates and town halls, Ms. Harris would also have an opportunity to draw an even starker contrast with Mr. Trump. Presidential campaigns increasingly are conducted as performances before a sympathetic audience, one that is invited to watch and listen but not to question or respond. The false intimacy of social media gives the impression that candidates are more present than ever in the lives of their supporters, but those relationships are one-way streets. Candidates are seen by the electorate but they do not see; they are heard but they do not hear. Mr. Trump, who speaks mostly about Mr. Trump, is an extreme example of this tendency — and it is a perfect embodiment of his politics. If Trump campaign officials were reluctant to have their candidate appear at large outside rallies in the wake of the assassination attempt against him, no one would question that fear. His campaign, however, continues to exist primarily as a series of long, winding speeches that offer no insight into how he would end the war in Ukraine or how he would solve the crisis at the border, two of the many goals he has promised to accomplish if re-elected. The former president has barely been pressed on important policy questions or offered any concrete plans. Both candidates say they are running for office to help ordinary Americans. One way for Americans to judge those claims is by their campaigns. Good leaders speak, and they listen. They welcome scrutiny. They accept responsibility. Ms. Harris now has a chance to demonstrate that she will be the kind of leader who deserves the nation’s support. ONLINE: https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/26/opinion/kamala-harris-donald-trump-debate.html ___ July 24 The Wall Street Journal says President Biden owed Americans an honest reason for ducking out of the 2024 election President Biden explained his abrupt departure from the presidential campaign in a speech to the nation Wednesday evening . . . actually, no he didn’t. He delivered an address from the Oval Office saying it was time to “pass the torch to a new generation.” But why was he all-in for re-election five days ago but all-out now? He didn’t say. Did he have some sudden health setback that forced the decision? Or was it a gradual recognition of his growing inability to do the job that finally took hold and he was forced to admit? Or, more likely, was he pushed from the race by fellow Democrats who had concluded that he was a sure loser to Donald Trump and had to go, or they would all say so in public? Mr. Biden explained nothing. “The defense of democracy, which is at stake, I think is more important than any title,” he said, without saying why he could no longer do the defending. He could have reassured Americans that he is still capable of doing the job for another six months, while warning adversaries not to take advantage of his remaining lame-duck period in office. Americans were left instead to infer the reasons as Mr. Biden said his accomplishments had earned him a second term but he would no longer seek it. His speech will do nothing to dispel the view that this was a coup by Democratic power brokers, and that he and they and his aides had been hiding the truth about his decline from the voters for months, if not years. We wanted to give Mr. Biden the benefit of the doubt for making the right decision to withdraw, and a gracious farewell would have enhanced that decision. He owed the country more than the self-serving, non-campaign campaign speech he chose to deliver on Wednesday.

Abortion is healthcare. The earlier it is available, the easier it is for people to make choices about their bodies that will affect the rest of their lives. But during election season, expect to hear some or all of these fallacies as Republicans who oppose abortion inaccurately discuss it. Abortion can happen after birth None are as ludicrous as the myth Donald Trump pitched in the presidential debate in June when he said Democrats “will take the life of a child in the eighth month, the ninth month, and even after birth — after birth.” Of course, there is no such thing as abortion after birth. Killing a fetus that emerges alive is infanticide. Abortion involves ending a pregnancy when the fetus is still in the uterus. In California, abortion is legal up to the point of the fetus’ viability to survive outside the uterus, which is around 24-25 weeks — or later if the abortion is necessary to protect the health or life of the pregnant person. The state is one of 20 where abortion is legal to the point of viability or a couple weeks less. In nine states and the District of Columbia, it is legal for any reason to have an abortion beyond that period. “I think it’s exceedingly rare to do an abortion past 32 weeks even in states where there are no limits,” says Daniel Grossman, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of California, San Francisco and the director of the the research program, Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health. In fact, only about 1% of abortions are performed past 21 weeks of gestation. When they do occur, they are usually done for severe fetal anomalies or to save a woman’s life, health or fertility. Trump also falsely claimed that a former Democratic governor of Virginia said he was willing to “rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month and kill the baby.” Not true. In fact, he said the opposite. In a 2019 interview, former Gov. Ralph Northam was asked about a Virginia state bill that would remove the requirement for three doctors to agree on whether an abortion was medically necessary in the third trimester. Northam, who is a pediatric neurologist, said that should be a decision left to the woman and her own doctor. He then talked about a situation where a doctor induces labor to deliver a fetus with a severe health problem not expected to live. He said: “If a mother is in labor, I can tell you exactly what would happen — the infant would be delivered. The infant would be kept comfortable. The infant would be resuscitated if that’s what the mother and the family desired.” Keeping the baby comfortable without performing aggressive measures is sometimes referred to as perinatal hospice care. Abortion is never necessary for emergency medical care Yes, it is. If the amniotic sac ruptures prematurely, especially in the second trimester, that can lead to infection, sepsis, a possible hysterectomy or death. That’s why an abortion is often performed. (If the sac ruptures in the third trimester, labor can often be induced at some point.) A pregnant person who develops a condition where the placenta completely covers the cervix and begins to bleed heavily also may need an abortion. These kinds of severe complications were at the heart of the case the Supreme Court heard this session on whether the state of Idaho’s extreme abortion law prevented pregnant women from getting the emergency care required in U.S. hospitals that receive federal funding. In Idaho, some women with severe pregnancy complications had to be airlifted to other states to have emergency abortions. The court decided it should not have granted review of the case but did restore a lower court’s order blocking the part of the law requiring women to be near death before getting an emergency abortion. Medication abortion is dangerous to women Medication abortion — the most common abortion procedure in the U.S. — is a two-drug regimen that has been prescribed in the United States since 2000. Serious complications occur in less than one-third of 1% of uses. That’s safer than taking Tylenol. The Supreme Court recently dismissed a case from a group of antiabortion doctors and organizations contending that mifepristone, the first drug in the regimen, had not been studied carefully enough by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration — despite the drug being safely in use for two decades. The court said the doctors had no standing to bring the suit since not one of them could identify a case where a doctor was forced, against their conscience, to perform a surgical abortion to deal with complications from a medication abortion. A majority of Americans support reproductive freedom and have voted to protect abortion access since the Supreme Court abolished that right in 2022. That hasn’t stopped Republicans from trying to use fear and falsehoods to justify their campaign to further whittle down abortion rights across the nation. In an election season filled with rhetoric, a woman’s ability to control her own body should not be obstructed by lies about what that means. ONLINE: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2024-07-25/editorial-trump-abortion-myths-that-should-not-fool-you ___ July 25 The Philadelphia Daily News/Inquirer on the Trump shooter, mental health resources in schools “He was bullied almost every day. He was just an outcast.” That observation by a former classmate of the 20-year-old man shot and killed by Secret Service agents after attempting to assassinate Donald Trump should have quelled all the loose talk spewed by the former president’s supporters to persuade voters that the tragic incident was politically motivated. Profiles of Thomas Matthew Crooks thus far instead resemble those of other young mass shooters going as far back as the 1999 murders of 12 students and a teacher at Columbine High School in Colorado. Since 1980, the median age of a mass shooter in this country has dropped from 39 years old to 22. Most mass shooters of any age are also non-Hispanic white men. Could Crooks have wanted to leave life in a blaze of glory? A Secret Service sharpshooter fatally shot him within moments after he wounded Trump and shot three other men, one of whom died. The lack of evidence leading to a specific motive for Crooks may leave that question unanswered forever, but that hasn’t stopped unsubstantiated accusations that he was stirred to action by anti-Trump comments made by President Joe Biden and other Democrats. It’s true that Crooks donated $15 to a Democratic organization on the day Biden was inaugurated in 2021, but later that year he registered to vote as a Republican. While the search for Crooks’ motivation continues, we should return to a topic that, like the need for better gun laws, our nation has yet to adequately address. America’s overburdened, underfunded mental health system still lacks enough resources to both help people before they become mass shooters and address the neglected needs of the general population. Our high schools, in particular, where students spend as much as seven hours a day or more, need trained staff members who can provide appropriate counseling before a student hurts themself or others. “He sat by himself, didn’t talk to anyone, didn’t even try to make conversation,” said another classmate of Crooks. “ He was an odd kid, but nothing about him seemed dangerous.” Figuring out which “odd kid” needs help requires more guidance counselors and advanced mental health professionals at our schools. Instead, many school boards have reduced those positions to save money. The American School Counselor Association recommends at least one counselor for every 250 students, but only Vermont (186) and New Hampshire (208) meet those criteria. Both Pennsylvania (353) and New Jersey (337) fall under the national average of 444 students per counselor, but their schools also fail to meet the ASCA standard. That means even when an overburdened school counselor notices a student has issues beyond bad grades or choosing a college, the demands of assisting dozens of other students may give them little time to intervene effectively. Even if time isn’t an issue, most guidance counselors are not specifically trained to help a student who exhibits behavior that may indicate they might commit a violent act. The National Association of School Psychologists recommends schools have one psychologist on-site for every 500 students, but the national average is only one psychologist for every 1,127 students. In Pennsylvania, the average is one school psychologist for every 1,022 students. New Jersey averages one psychologist for every 663 students, but that doesn’t meet the NASP standard, either. Most students who need help don’t become a danger to others, but many harm themselves, and some die by suicide. Students’ mental health was further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, which closed schools, limited children’s interaction with peers, and increased their time on social media sites. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy declared a mental health crisis among children in 2021 and issued another warning last year about social media’s adverse impact on young people. School districts need more resources to intervene when they recognize a student needs mental health assistance. One avenue may be funding provided through a federal grant program that is part of the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act signed into law last year by President Biden. It includes $1 billion to be competitively awarded to school districts implementing programs to “prevent and respond to acts of bullying, violence, and hate.” Urgency, however, should also spur state and local governments and school boards to act beyond stringent security measures. Schools not only need teachers, administrators, and support staff, they also need enough guidance counselors and mental health professionals on-site to help prevent a school from becoming the scene of an avoidable calamity.

Harris opened her appearance before a crowd of 10,000 in Atlanta on Tuesday by taking aim at Trump’s record — criminal and otherwise — and calling out the ex-president for killing the bipartisan immigration bill that was crafted by one of the nation’s most conservative senators earlier this year. In a reference to her background as a prosecutor, she told rally goers she had taken on “perpetrators of all kinds,” including “predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers,” and “cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain.” “So hear me when I say I know Donald Trump’s type — I know the type, and I have been dealing with people like him my entire career,” she said, leading the crowd to respond with chants of “lock him up,” referring to the ex-president’s 34 felony convictions; Harris also said she would “proudly” compare her record against Trump’s “any day of the week,” including on the subject of immigration, citing her work as the attorney general of California, which shares a border with Mexico. “I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,” she said. By contrast, Harris said Trump “has been talking a big game about securing our border” but “ does not walk the walk.” “Our administration worked on the most significant border security bill in decades. Some of the most conservative Republicans in Washington, DC supported the bill, even the Border Patrol endorsed it,” she said as she recalled how the bill had been “all set to pass” before Trump “directed his allies in the Senate to vote it down.” “He tanked, tanked the bipartisan deal because he thought it would help him win an election,” she said, adding that she would push a Democratic congress to enact the same bill to law when she is in the White House as president. In response, the crowd roared with approval. The vice president’s appearance at the raucous Atlanta rally demonstrated the massive shift in culture and enthusiasm that has swept through the Democratic Party in the nine days since President Biden shocked the world by announcing that he would become the first American president to stand down from seeking a second term since Lyndon Johnson did so amid the upheaval from the Vietnam War in 1968. Biden’s campaign appearances were usually daytime affairs hosted by labor unions or other Democratic-leaning groups, or nighttime fundraisers with audiences limited to smaller groups of donors and video footage tightly controlled by his campaign apparatus. But since becoming the party’s de facto nominee last week, Harris has returned to the packed rallies that characterized Democratic campaigns before the Covid-19 pandemic upended the 2020 election cycle, with star-studded guest lists reminiscent of Barack Obama’s first campaign for the presidency in 2008. By the time she took the stage at the Georgia State Convocation Center, the stands had been packed to the rafters with a crowd campaign officials estimated at more than 10,000 attendees. They were warmed up by Peach State Democratic mainstays, including former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and Georgia’s two Democratic senators, Jon Ossoff and Rev Raphael Warnock. But even those politicians’ national profiles compared to another of the warm-up acts who entertained the crowd in the minutes before Harris took to the stage: Grammy-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion. The rapper performed four songs: “Girls in the Hood,” “Mamushi,” “Body,” and “Savage” as she exhorted the crowd to vote for Harris. Before she began “Body,” she told them Harris would protect their reproductive rights. “Now I know my ladies in the crowd love their bodies — and if you want to keep loving your body, you know who to vote for,” she said. She also called Harris “our future president” and told the crowd they were “about to make history with the first female president — the first black female president.” “Let’s get this done, honey,” she added. After Thee Stallion performed to cheers from rally goers, Atlanta-area rapper Quavo praised Harris for her work on addressing gun violence, calling the vice president someone who “always stands on business.” But the cheers both musicians received paled in comparison to the ovation Harris got when she took the stage to Beyonce’s “Freedom” and launched into her remarks. In what has become a standard part of her stump speech, she warned that Trump wants to implement a “Project 2025” agenda that would “cut Social Security and Medicare,” as well as “give tax breaks to billionaires and big corporations” and “gut the Affordable Care Act.” “America has tried these failed policies before, and we are not going back.,” she said. “We’re not going back, because ours is a fight for the future, and it is a fight for freedom. Across our nation, we are witnessing a full on assault on hard fought, hard won freedoms and rights, the freedom to vote, the freedom to be safe from gun violence, the freedom to live without fear of bigotry and hate, the freedom to love who you love openly and with pride, the freedom to learn and acknowledge our true and full history. And the freedom of a woman to make decisions about her own body and not have her government tell her what to do,” she said. But Harris also challenged Trump on his recent decision to waffle on whether to debate her at the September 10 presidential debate set to air on ABC. She said Trump’s decision was because “the momentum in this race is shifting” and called the move a “sign that Donald Trump is feeling it.” “Here’s the funny thing about that. So he won’t debate, but he and his running mate sure seem to have a lot to say about me,” she added, drawing laughs when she asked if the crowd finds her opponents “just plain weird.” Speaking to Trump directly, Harris challenged him to show up and confront her. “Donald, I do hope you’ll reconsider to meet me on the debate stage, because as the saying goes: If you got something to say, you should say it to my face.”","summary":"The Vice President and the ‘Hot Girl Summer’ rapper both took to the stage at a rally in Atlanta, Georgia","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-atlanta-rally-trump-border-b2588550.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/31/01/AP24212861191779.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6gamLeMn-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:45:07","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.091},{"id":253009708,"title":"When Trump Criticized Kamala Harris as Being 'Extraordinarily Nasty' For Questioning Brett Kavanaugh","text":"When Joe Biden chose Kamala Harris as his vice presidential pick in 2020, then-President Donald Trump was quick to attack her. He deemed Harris 'nasty' and 'horrible' within minutes of the announcement. The Republican leader argued Harris was 'extraordinarily nasty' to Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings. He claimed she was 'disrespectful' and \"probably nastier than even Pocahontas\" to Biden during the Democratic debates. \"She was nasty to a level that was just a horrible thing,\" Trump told reporters. He added, \"The way she treated now Justice Kavanaugh, and I won't forget that soon.\" Trump's campaign also released an ad calling Harris 'phony' and part of the 'radical Left'. It read, \"Voters rejected Harris. They smartly spotted a phony. But not Joe Biden. He's not that smart.\" Harris gained attention for her tough questioning of Kavanaugh in 2018. She asked him if he had discussed the Mueller investigation with anyone at a law firm run by Trump's lawyer. When Kavanaugh didn't give a clear answer, Harris asserted, \"I think you're thinking of someone and you don't want to tell us,\" as per ABC News. She also pressed Kavanaugh on abortion rights, asking, \"Can you think of any laws that give the government the power to make decisions about the male body?\" Kavanaugh struggled to respond. In 2019, Harris also grilled Attorney General, William Barr, about the Mueller report. She asked if anyone at the White House had ever suggested he open an investigation. When Barr hesitated, Harris said sharply, \"It seems you'd remember something like that and be able to tell us.\" As per CBS News, in light of the same, Trump shared that he was surprised when Biden picked her. He tried to paint Harris as extremely liberal, calling her \"the most liberal person in the U.S. Senate,\" as per VOA News. However, Harris is generally seen as more moderate than some other Democrats. His harsh words about Harris mirrored how he talked about Hillary Clinton back in 2016 when he called her 'nasty' during a debate. Trump has made a name for throwing insults at women in politics, especially women of color, as per CNN. Some saw Trump's comments as sexist and racist. Donna Brazile, former Democratic National Committee chair, said Biden's choice of Harris at the time, showed the growing political influence of voters of color in the U.S. However, not everyone was enthusiastic about Harris. Some progressives criticized her record as California's attorney general. Lindsey Roland, a Black voter in Michigan, argued, \"I still think she was empowered to stand up more for minorities, and I think it was just a really missed opportunity.\" However, criminal justice reform advocate, Rashad Robinson, believed Harris had evolved. He said, \"She's been willing to listen and willing to evolve, and she's been willing to put legislation behind that evolution.\"","summary":"Kamala Harris was called &#34;extraordinarily nasty&#34; by Donald Trump during Brett Kavanaugh during his Supreme Court confirmation hearings.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/when-trump-criticized-kamala-harris-as-being-extraordinarily-nasty-for-questioning-brett-kavanaugh","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/708119/uploads/75b12150-4e69-11ef-917f-8b2f284a5630_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:45:00","author":"INQUISITR,Shraddha","authors":["INQUISITR","Shraddha"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":253009530,"title":"Project 2025 director steps down amid criticism from Donald Trump","text":"July 30 (UPI) -- Project 2025 director, Paul Dans, is stepping down at the Heritage Foundation amid intense scrutiny from Donald Trump, who chastised the group for linking its conservative blueprint to his campaign, as Democrats vowed to continue linking the report's policies to the former president. \"President Trump's campaign has been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign and should not be associated with the campaign or the president in any way,\" Trump campaign co-managers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said in a statement. Trump told supporters during a rally earlier this month that Project 2025 was written by people on the \"severe right\" and that its policies were \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.\" The 922-page document, which has been used heavily by Democrats to target Trump, calls for expanding presidential power, eliminating the Department of Education, restricting welfare programs, cutting federal funding for clean energy research and taking the abortion pill mifepristone off the market. \"When we began Project 2025 in April 2022, we set a timeline for the project to conclude its policy drafting after the two party conventions this year, and we are sticking to that timeline,\" Kevin Roberts, president of the Heritage Foundation, wrote Tuesday in a post on X. \"Paul, who built the project from scratch and bravely led this endeavor over the past two years, will be departing the team and moving up to the front where the fight remains,\" Roberts added. Trump and his campaign have repeatedly distanced themselves from the initiative and have warned those involved in creating Project 2025 that they would be barred from working in a second Trump administration. In a statement released Tuesday, the former president and his campaign called the project's \"demise\" welcomed news. \"Reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign -- it will not end well for you,\" said LaCivita and Wiles. While Democrats have used Project 2025's policy proposals to target Trump, Kamala Harris' campaign said Tuesday their plan of attack will not change despite the director's decision to leave. \"Project 2025 is on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot. This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez claimed in a statement.

It’s way too early to confirm who will be speaking at the Democratic convention in Chicago, which kicks off Aug. 19 at the United Center — or the Hollywood, Broadway and musical stars who will appear along with the party giants. But if, as Shakespeare wrote, the past is prologue, we have some educated guesses. Barack Obama. Michelle Obama. Bill Clinton. Hillary Clinton. All are powerful speakers who will make the case for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presumptive nominee and the TBD running mate she needs to pick in the next few days. The biggest suspense may be what Republicans the Harris team can woo to speak — with the highest value targets being people who worked in the Trump White House and really know best former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee. Modern political conventions are produced prime-time shows. The viewers are the main audience — not the delegates, donors and party activists inside the convention hall. In Milwaukee, the biggest viewing audience, according to the Nielsen ratings, came on the last night, with people eager to hear Trump talk about the assassin’s bullet that struck his ear just days before. When Trump’s vice president pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, spoke on the third night, he attracted 17.9 million viewers, according to the ratings service, compared to 25.3 million for Trump. With the Republican Party transformed into the Trump MAGA party, no former GOP president, vice president or White House nominee attended, much less spoke. In Chicago, Harris will have a second chance to make a first impression. That’s crucial, since the point of a convention is to gain the vote of people who may have not been paying much attention to politics. For Democrats, those are people who were not enthused about President Joe Biden, who dropped his re-election bid on July 21; swing voters who are persuadable, and Republicans who want nothing to do with Trump but have a hard time voting for a Democrat. Twenty years ago this week, on July 27, 2004 at the Democratic convention in Boston, the world discovered the oratorical power of a then fairly unknown keynote speaker, a state senator by the name of Barack Obama who was running for a Senate seat from Illinois. Obama’s speech was so powerful — there are no red states, no blue states, just the United States — that it put him on the path to the White House. Obama is one of the most popular Democrats with an incredible ability to communicate. With the home field advantage in Chicago, remarks from Obama, the nation’s first Black president making the case for the woman who may be the second, will be much anticipated. Former first lady Michelle Obama, who remains extremely popular, is also likely to speak about a candidate who would be the first female president. It is inconceivable that Michelle Obama would deliver a speech that did not take into account her humble upbringing just a few miles away in a tiny apartment on the South Side. As good a speaker as her husband, at the 2016 Democratic convention in Philadelphia — the one nominating Hillary Clinton — Michelle Obama in her speech delivered her now famous call and response. You remember it — “When they go low, we go high.” Former President Bill Clinton has delivered speeches at every Democratic convention since 1980 and there is no reason out there to think he won’t go for one more in Chicago. At the 2012 Democratic convention in Charlotte, N.C. Clinton was tasked with nominating Obama for a second term. Clinton’s speech was a master class in making complex government policies and issues simple and why people should vote for Democrats. Since then, Clinton has been known as the “Explainer-in-chief.” Within hours after Biden stepped aside, Harris was able to all but claim the nomination, invigorating Democrats, especially women. On Tuesday, Hillary Clinton, in a fundraising appeal, reflected back on her history-making nomination at the 2016 Philadelphia convention, where she became the first woman to lead the Democratic ticket. “We made history that day,” Clinton wrote. “The excitement was palpable. Shattering the long-awaited glass ceiling of a woman in the White House felt closer than ever before.

She ended by pleading for a cease-fire and declaring, “I will not be silent.” I am reminded that President Biden has not been silent. During the whole 10-month siege on Gaza, Biden has pleaded with Netanyahu for a cease-fire while at the same time providing the half-ton bombs used to indiscriminately massacre innocent women and children — the height of hypocrisy and an embarrassment to our country. Let us hope Kamala Harris will do more than complain about the egregious death toll of innocent civilians in Gaza. Actions speak louder than words. Forrest Cioppa Walnut Creek Premiums aren’t what make insurers thrive Re: “How to cool down California’s heated home insurance market” (Page A8, July 28). The East Bay Times guest editorial by an insurance company president claims insurance companies can’t survive on insurance coverage revenue when losses exceed earned premiums. Having worked for an insurance company for 32 years, I’m going to counter what he said. The fact is, the majority of insurance companies don’t live on earned premiums. They live on investments. Insurance companies will take your dollars and buy investments. Many insurance companies own investment properties such as tenanted commercial real estate and buy investments such as stocks and municipal bonds. Those insurance companies that are investor-owned receive more money from stock purchases that increase the cash flow to buy more investments. Insurance companies have highly skilled portfolio managers who are experts at maximizing investments. Lawrence Shulman Clayton Trump should carefully choose source material Re: “Trump to Christians: If I win, ‘You don’t have to vote again’” (Page A4, July 28). Donald Trump’s promise to the The Believers’ Summit on July 26 sounded eerily familiar: “Get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote again. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote.” Pay no attention to what you’ve been told. Trust me. All will be well. Surely the Turning Point Christians have read or heard that message before. Genesis 3. The Temptation of Eve by the Serpent. Pay no attention to what you’ve been told. Trust me. She did and we all know what followed. Advice to Donald Trump: To avoid being compared to Satan, select your analogies more carefully. Moral for everyone else: Trust not the soothing words of the serpent. Martha Toppin Walnut Creek Harris administration would offer hard lesson I can understand why many young, first-time voters, especially those right out of high school, will flock to Kamala Harris. It gives them the exciting opportunity to make history by electing our first woman president with the promise of a lot of free stuff and a comfortable life. It will take them a few election cycles to learn that all politicians lie and that there is no such thing as a free lunch. They will also learn that most presidents do more harm than good, and some are so bad their policies and decisions get people killed. Right now, our volunteer military enlistments are falling short of their goals and the world is a tinder box in part because of our country’s perceived weakness. How the bad guys act under a Harris presidency versus a Donald Trump one may result in a life-altering change of plans for those first-time voters of draft age.

Coming on after a performance by supporter Megan Thee Stallion, Harris opened with her crowd-pleasing attack on Trump, 78 — casting herself as a tough-on-crime prosecutor going up against a “predator.” “As many of you know, before I was elected vice president, and before I was elected a United States senator, I was an elected attorney general and an elected district attorney, and before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor. So in those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who broke the rules for their own game,” Harris said. “So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type,” she added to raucous applause. It was her second campaign rally as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — after she spoke to 3,000 people last week in Milwaukee. The large crowd blew away the generally small audiences of President Biden, who ended his campaign July 21 and endorsed Harris as his successor. Harris tried to address head-on one of her biggest liabilities — her performance on securing the border as Biden’s point person on reducing illegal immigration. “In this campaign, I will proudly put my record against his any day, any day of the week — including, for example, on the issue of immigration,” Harris said. “I was the attorney general of the border state. In that job, I walked underground tunnels between the United States and Mexico on that border with law enforcement officers. I went after transnational gangs, drug cartels and human traffickers that came into our country illegally. I prosecuted them in case after case, and I won,” she said. “Donald Trump, on the other hand, has been talking a big game about securing our border, but he does not walk the walk. Or as my friend, Quavo would say, ‘He does not walk it like he talks it.” She claimed “Donald Trump does not care about border security. He only cares about himself. And when I am president, I will work to actually solve the problem.” Harris made the claim despite Republicans regularly slaming her actions as so-called “border czar” — as she presided over sequential record-breaking annual illegal crossings — with polls showing that immigration is a leading liability for Democrats alongside economic concerns.

Josh Shapiro rips antisemitic graffiti on two Pittsburgh community centers","text":"BETHLEHEM, Pa. — Pittsburgh has once again become the target of antisemites after two Jewish community centers in the Steel City were vandalized with red spray paint early Monday – and Pennsylvania leaders are putting their foot down. “Jews 4 Palestine” was emblazoned on the building of the Chabad of Squirrel Hill, a synagogue in the wealthy neighborhood it’s named for. Not four miles west of there, another antisemitic message was stained in spray paint at the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, situated along the Monongahela River. The graffiti graced a sign bearing the org’s name, with an arrow pointing down to a message that read: “funds genocide.” Beneath that charming message was the kicker: “Love Jews, hate Zionists.” Politicians from both parties were quick to call out the latest instance of public antisemitism in Pittsburgh’s thriving Jewish community, where a gunman killed 11 people and injured several more at the Tree of Life synagogue in 2018. Two Democrat House members from the area, Reps. Chris Deluzio and Summer Lee, condemned the incidents on X. “These sanctuaries should be a refuge for those looking for community and spiritual healing. They must be respected and protected,” the progressive Lee tweeted, without explicitly mentioning Jews or antisemitism. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) decried the use of “Hamas symbolism” in the graffiti — apparently a reference to the vandals’ distinction between Jews and “Zionists.” “Vandalism is never acceptable, and the use of Hamas symbolism must be condemned in the strongest terms,” Casey tweeted Monday. Casey’s opponent, GOP Senate hopeful Dave McCormick, lives in Pittsburgh’s Squirrel Hill neighborhood and jumped at the chance to blame Democrats for the vandalism on X. “Horrified to see more vulgar antisemitism near my home,” McCormick wrote. “PA’s Jewish communities deserve safety and respect. But Bob Casey and Kamala Harris have failed them by giving a free pass to this movement every time disgusting and dangerous actions like this happen,” he added. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who is Jewish, delivered the most forceful statement against the vandalism by invoking memories of the Tree of Life Synagogue massacre. “The Squirrel Hill community witnessed the deadliest act of antisemitism in our nation’s history at Tree of Life Synagogue. They should not need to wake up to antisemitic graffiti in their neighborhood,” Shapiro tweeted Monday. “Vandalism of any type of a house of worship has no home in our Commonwealth — and we must all continue to call it out and speak with moral clarity,” the governor added. Shapiro has been hitting the campaign trail hard for Kamala Harris lately. The popular Democrat governor is on the shortlist of candidates under consideration for the VP spot on Harris’ campaign, which is currently in the veep-vetting process. However, the gov has taken some heat from the left for his unabashedly pro-Israel stance and willingness to call out antisemitism, such as on college campuses in Pennsylvania. Earlier this month, an anti-Shapiro group called “No Genocide Josh” launched both a website and X profile urging Harris to look elsewhere for a running mate. “He compared peaceful protestors to KKK ralliers, has opposed a ceasefire in Palestine, has promoted private school vouchers, and has covered up a sexual harassment scandal in his own office,” the website’s home page reads. Rep. Ritchie Torres, a New York Democrat, called out the group in a tweet Friday, condemning the antisemitism Shapiro has faced from the left flank of his party, calling it a “far left smear campaign.” “The antisemitic far left must never be given veto power over the selection of a presidential running mate,” Torres’ tweet concluded. Proponents of Shapiro say his more conservative positions on Israel and school choice could energize moderate voters to come out for Harris – especially as voters continue to perceive the VP as more liberal than the outgoing President Joe Biden, who only narrowly won the purple state in 2020.","summary":"Pittsburgh has once again become the target of antisemites after two Jewish community centers in the Steel City were vandalized with red spray paint early Monday.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/pennsylvania-gov-josh-shapiro-rips-antisemitic-graffiti-on-two-pittsburgh-community-centers/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/86463063.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:19:50","author":"Carson Swick","authors":["Carson Swick"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.244},{"id":253008390,"title":"Kamala Harris erases Donald Trump’s advantage in battleground states: poll","text":"Former President Donald Trump’s battleground state advantage appears to have evaporated in the little more than a week since Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, a new poll showed. On average, she notched a 48% to 47% lead in battleground states – jumping ahead in four out of seven of the key contests, according to a Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll. The poll pegged Harris led the polls in Arizona with 49% support to Trump’s 47%; Michigan with 53% to 42%; Nevada with 47% to 45%; and Wisconsin with 49% to 47%. Prior to Biden’s abrupt exit, Trump, 78, had generally been leading in most of the battleground state polling, with some variation. Trump still carried the lead in North Carolina (48% to Harris’ 46%) and Pennsylvania (50% to Harris’ 46%) in the Tuesday poll. The two candidates tied in Georgia with 47% each. The poll is among the earliest comprehensive surveys of the battleground states since President Biden’s seismic July 21 decision to withdraw from the race and endorse Harris, 59. Earlier this month, another Bloomberg News/Morning Consult poll gauged Biden, 81, behind Trump at 45% to 47% – a two-point spread that also represented Biden’s strongest performance in the battleground states after his disastrous debate performance. At the time, that poll pegged Trump up in Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, but behind Biden in Michigan and Wisconsin. Other polls generally showed Biden losing ground at the time in the wake of his debate performance, which triggered a mutiny among Democrats that ultimately culminated with his decision to drop out. Still, most of the battleground states in the most recent poll are within the margin of error, suggesting an even race. The survey sampled 4,973 registered voters from July 24-28 across the seven main battleground states. It held a general margin of error of plus or minus 1 percentage point for the main chunk of swing states. The margin of error came in at 3 points for Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania; 4 points in Michigan, North Carolina, and Wisconsin; and 5 points in Nevada. The Trump campaign’s top pollster Tony Fabrizio previously warned that Harris would enjoy a “honeymoon phase” in polling over the early days of her abrupt ascension. “That means we will start to see public polling — particularly national public polls — where Harris is gaining on or even leading President Trump,” he explained in a memo last week. “While the public polls may change in the short run and she may consolidate a bit more of the Democrat base, Harris can’t change who she is or what she’s done. Stay tuned…” he added. The recently rebranded Harris for President campaign has boasted about the apparent jump in momentum, hauling in some $200 million within her first week as the de facto top-of-the-ticket. Trump and his campaign have begun recalibrating their messaging to go after Harris more aggressively and sew concerns in the minds of voters about her past flirtation with hard-left policies. Bloomberg News/Morning Consult’s Tuesday poll also found that a third of voters across the seven battleground states indicated that they are more likely to cast ballots in the election due to the Democrats’ switcharoo. That includes 44% and 49% of Hispanic and black voters, respectively. Previously, Biden appeared to struggle to ignite enthusiasm from those blocs of voters. In a silver lining for Trump, voters in the survey ranked the economy as their top issue – giving the 45th president an eight-point advantage over Harris. Still, that’s down from the 14-point edge Trump held over Biden. Nationally, Trump is leading Harris by 2 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics aggregate of a five-way matchup. Biden’s decision to withdraw at this stage of the race is unprecedented. Harris is now racing to select her running mate ahead of the Democrats’ planned virtual roll call to crown their nominee early next month.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump's battleground state advantage appears to have evaporated just over a week after Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive Democratic nominee, a new poll showed.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/kamala-harris-erases-donald-trumps-advantage-in-battleground-states-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/us-vice-president-democratic-presidential-86498592.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:19:18","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.093},{"id":253008604,"title":"White Dudes For Harris Founders Blame Elon Musk For X Account’s Suspension","text":"Two of the founders of White Dudes for Harris, a political organizing group and popular Zoom meeting that gained massive popularity and raised a reported $190,000 for Kamala Harris’ presidential bid this week, blamed Elon Musk for its official X (formerly Twitter) account being suspended following an enormous fundraising event that saw over 200,000 attendees tune in. Early on Tuesday morning, Ross Morales Rocketto, who helped launch White Dudes For Harris in the days following President Joe Biden leaving the 2024 Democratic ticket, wrote on X that the @dudes4harris account on the platform had been suspended and that there was no reason as to why. This came on the heels of a successful three-hour and twenty-minute initial Zoom call on Monday night that featured celebrities and politicians drumming up support for Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee. “Got @elonmusk scared,” he wrote on X in a post that displayed an image of the suspended page. In a tweet hours later, he added: “Funny how after we had an awesome #WhiteDudesforHarris called last where a bunch of men got together to be earnest, vulnerable, and fired up that @elonmusk suspended our account as I got hundreds of insults and memes from white supremacist bot accounts that are still active.” The image included with that X post reads “4 million + raise 190K attendees 1 scared billionaire,” referencing Monday night’s fundraising haul and count of those who logged into the Zoom meeting or watched on the YouTube page that broadcast its proceedings live. It’s unclear what rules were violated by the @dudes4harris account that would lead to its suspension; Mike Nellis, an organizer for White Dudes For Harris, posted on his personal X account during the hours that the account was suspended an email sent by the company indicating the suspension was a result of violation the platform’s rules against “evading suspicion” and that it was initiated by a user report. On Tuesday, The Hollywood Reporter sent an email to X’s press department asking for the reason for the suspension and also to respond to the suggestion it was ordered by Musk. The company’s reply read, “Busy now, please check back later” — the second day in a row THR has received this reply from X. The suspension was brief and at 12:47 p.m., the account posted the following message: “WE ARE SO BACK!

Number Two, she doesn´t like Jewish people. You know it, I know it and everybody knows it and nobody wants to say it,’ Trump said. Trump claimed Harris ‘dislikes Jewish people’, despite her marriage to second gentleman Doug Emhoff, in comments that drew a sharp rebuke from the the Harris campaign. Interviewer Sid Rosenberg brought up Emhoff, saying, ‘He´s Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me?’ At that point, Trump can be heard saying ‘Yeah.’ ‘He´s a crappy Jew,’ said Rosenberg. ‘Yeah,’ Trump said again. Then Rosenberg added, without explanation, ‘He´s a horrible Jew.’ The remarks drew an immediate response from the Harris campaign. ‘America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump,’ said Harris campaign spokesman James Singer. ‘Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country instead of divides it, uses the power of the presidency to help families instead of hurt them, and has a vision for our future, instead of taking us backwards.’ Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told DailyMail.com when asked about the comments by Rosenberg, ‘He obviously wasn’t agreeing with that sentiment. In fact, Kamala has stoked anti-Israel hate on school campuses with her dangerous and divisive rhetoric.’ Trump made a similar claim about Harris disliking Jewish people on Friday while speaking to a Christian group at a Turning Point USA gathering in Florida. He has also ignited blowback in the past for making similar remarks about Jewish people, like when he said in March that Jews who vote for Democrats ‘hate Israel’ and hate ‘their religion.’ Emhoff, the first Jewish person to serve as the spouse of a nationally elected U.S. leader, has been one of the most visible members of the Biden administration speaking about combating antisemitism. He hung mezuzahs on the doorposts of the vice president´s residence and led Passover celebrations at the White House. Trump also attacked Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer, who is Jewish. ‘Fifteen years ago, you couldn’t say a bad thing [about Israel], you’d be out of office. And today it’s almost like — I mean, Schumer has become a Palestinian. Chuck Schumer is officially now a Palestinian,’ Trump said.

Shapiro, who is a contender to be Vice-President Kamala Harris’ Democratic Party running mate in the November US presidential election, said he was viewing the proposed merger through its impact on workers. “Speaking from a state perspective as governor, if the US steel workers aren’t happy with this deal, which they are not, I’m not happy with this deal,” Shapiro said at an Internal Revenue Service event attended by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “If I don’t see a future where US Steel manufacturing continues here in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and is expanding from what is happening right now, I’m not happy, so I’ve got really serious concerns,” he said. Shapiro told a press conference after a tax event in Philadelphia that he will review any business deal through “the prism of how does it impact Pennsylvania workers”, as the state has grown thanks to US Steel and other industrial manufacturers. US Steel, founded in 1901, is headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a key battleground state in the November 5 election. Both US President Joe Biden, who abandoned his bid for a second term and endorsed Harris to be his successor more than a week ago, and Donald Trump, the Republican nominee in the election, have backed US Steel’s unionised workers in their strong opposition to the deal. The Japanese and US firms believe the merger, creating the world’s third-largest steelmaker by volume, would benefit them. A large majority of US Steel shareholders have also already approved the US$14.1 billion deal. But since the planned all-cash transaction was announced in December, United Steelworkers International has spoken against it, turning it into a sensitive political issue. Biden, who needed to secure support from trade unions for the presidential election, said multiple times earlier this year that the steelmaker should be domestically owned. On Tuesday, Shapiro also said: “What’s been put forth on the table is not something that would enjoy my approval, and I’m going to continue to stand directly side-by-side and locked-arms with US steel workers, the very people who have built this commonwealth and this country.” “They deserve real respect,” added the governor. The acquisition plan needs to be approved by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which is in charge of examining certain foreign investment transactions in US firms and determining whether they pose national security threats. The committee, also known as CFIUS, is chaired by Yellen, who said in April she accepted Biden’s view that US Steel should remain in American hands. Asked where the merger plan’s review stands now, she said CFIUS will look at any transaction from a national security perspective and try to make the right decision, but that she is “not able to talk about the specifics”.

Coincidentally, however, Emhoff dropped in right in the middle of Harris’ push to target Asian voters – particulary in the Hmong community, many of whom didn’t appreciate the second gent crashing their event to canvass. Cory Tomczyk, a Republican state senator, told The Post that those he spoke with in the Hmong community were not pleased with the chaos and campaign paraphernalia Emhoff brought to the event. “There was a huge backlog of people trying to get into the events,” said Tomczyk, who was at the festival manning the Republican booth. Security checkpoints held up people for an hour trying to get to the flag football games and volleyball tournaments. Eventually, the crowd became fed up – and pushed past security. “There was nothing the Secret Service could do,” Tomczyk noted. “Hundreds of people were in a line a street wide for a couple of blocks, on foot, waiting to get in because the Secret Service had the main gate shut down.” Chaos wasn’t the only complaint. Others thought Emhoff’s visit was in poor taste, overshadowing culture with campaigning. “It’s unfortunate that Mr. Emhoff decided to turn an important event honoring the sacrifices of Hmong veterans into a partisan campaign event,” said GOP Rep. Tom Tiffany, whose district includes Wausau, Wis., where Hmong Americans make up the town’s largest ethnic minority. “If the Biden-Harris Administration really cared about the Hmong community they would be working day and night to reduce inflation and the cost of energy, secure our borders, and contain the threat posed by Communist China. Anything else is simply ineffective lip service meant to win votes,” he told The Post. Still, Emhoff proceeded to pander to those in attendance. “This community right here could decide the election in this state, which could decide the entire election,” Emhoff told festival-goers. “You have the power right here.” Governor Tony Evers (D-Wis.) and Senator Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) also attended the festival. The latter, who is in a tough re-election race this November, appeared to be there in her official capacity rather than to campaign. It’s no surprise that Harris wants a piece of the Hmong vote in Wisconsin – they number 60,000 strong statewide, making up about 1% of the population. Central Wisconsin is not exactly a blue stronghold for the Democrats. Marathon County, where Wausau is located, went for Trump in 2016 by over 18 points: 57% to Hillary Clinton’s 39%. Trump won the county by the same margin in 2020 against Biden. In 2020 Democrats made a concerted effort to reach the Hmong vote, a strategy that the Harris campaign is building on using the VP’s South Asian heritage. Republicans in the state have also built relationships with the community. Former Republican Gov. Scott Walker attended the first Hmong Wausau Festival in 2017. In 2021, a Republican-led effort designated May 14 as Hmong-Lao Veterans Day in Wisconsin in recognition of Hmong fighters’ partnership with US forces during the Vietnam War. This is the first year there was a Republican outreach booth at the festival and it was “very well received,” Tomczyk told The Post. He also said he brought ten Trump yard signs to the festival, not knowing how many would be wanted, and all of them were taken. “I interacted with a lot of people,” Tomczyk said. “It’s our fault we’ve been absent from this festival,” noting the family values of the Hmong community that “align with Republican values.” The Hmong community is the largest Asian racial group in the Badger State, comprising 33% of all Asian residents. Wisconsin also has the third largest Hmong population in the country, after Minnesota and California. In April of this year, Evers signed into law a bill mandating the teaching of Hmong and Asian American history in public schools, inserting the language into existing law mandating the teaching of American Indian, Black and Hispanic histories. The Hmong community is not one cohesive voting bloc, as business people and entrepreneurs in the community favor Republican policies, while others favor the Democrats’ social policies. Memorably, Donald Trump’s administration faced a public backlash in 2020 when it was revealed they were in talks with the Laos government about deporting non-citizen and criminal Hmong and Lao residents back to the communist country.","summary":"Second Gentleman Emhoff visited a Hmong festival in Central Wisconsin last weekend as the Harris campaign uses the VP's South Asian heritage to reach the Asian vote.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/emhoff-rallies-hmong-vote-in-wi-as-harris-campaign-target-asian-vote/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-wwca5baub-1722376156585.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722361829&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TPnkuS3r-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:10:27","author":"Amy Sikma","authors":["Amy Sikma"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.17},{"id":253008728,"title":"Kamala Harris focusing on final contenders for her VP pick, sources say","text":"A top tier of contenders has emerged to be the running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, CBS News has learned, with a pick expected to be made by Monday.

He said the Constitution provided life appointments for justices and that President Biden “absolutely knows” his proposal would be “unconstitutional.” “I couldn’t be more disappointed,“ Mr. McConnell said. ”This is a man who was chairman of the Judiciary Committee for a long time.” His comments cast further doubt on the success of the president’s multi-pronged approach, which also includes a binding code of ethics and constitutional amendment prohibiting criminal immunity for presidents. President Biden’s July 30 proposals were quickly met with strong opposition from congressional Republicans. Like Mr. McConnell, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) called the proposals “dead on arrival.” Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have both welcomed the reforms. The term limits proposal would allow presidents to appoint a new justice every two years with each justice’s term of “active service” ending after 18 years, President Biden said in an op-ed for The Washington Post. In the op-ed, he cited the Presidential Commission on the Supreme Court of the United States, which he formed in 2021. The proposals will likely feature prominently on the 2024 campaign trail as vice president and presumptive Democrat nominee Kamala Harris has endorsed the reforms and criticized the court’s actions. “There is a clear crisis of confidence facing the U.S. Supreme Court,” she in a post to X on July 29. Constitutional amendments require state and national approval for ratification. According to Article V of the Constitution, Congress can send the issue to the states after two-thirds of both the House and Senate approve an amendment. From there, three-fourths of the state legislatures or state ratifying conventions must also approve.

Stateside, there’s a political battle royal: ugly fights online, anti-Israel protesters spraying DC with pro-terrorist graffiti, and racially segregated Zoom pep rallies for Kamala Harris. Meanwhile, in Paris, the only colors that matter are red, white and blue. And our American athletes, in their infinite greatness, are shining a light of unity across the ocean. It feels like a much-needed respite and distraction. A nightly salve coming through the boob tube. On Tuesday, we witnessed the triumphant return of gymnast Simone Biles pushing through injury to help her team, including the wonderful Sunisa Lee, Jordan Chiles, Jade Carey and Hezly Rivera, to gold. Our comeback queen showed the power of grit. As she attempted the vault, the event that gave her the “twisties” and led her to dropping out in Tokyo three years ago, we all collectively held our breath. She nailed it — and didn’t your heart soar watching her? As Biles completed her dazzling floor exercise, the crowd — which included such legendary athletes as Michael Phelps and Serena Williams — screamed “U-S-A! U-S-A! U-S-A!” In the first few days, our best and brightest are giving us many reasons to pop on some Lee Greenwood and feel unadulterated pride. From flag bearer LeBron James leading Team USA down the Seine — his position at the front of the boat drawing funny comparisons to Washington crossing the Delaware — to the enduring dominance and longevity of swimmer Katie Ledecky, competing in her fourth Olympics and still poised to make history. The men’s gymnasts flipping and pommeling their way to that team’s first medal in 16 years. The women’s rugby team dramatically knocking off Australia to earn their first ever medal. But it’s also about how the Team USA athletes are competing and representing themselves: a celebration of hard work, sacrifice and tenacity. They’ve exhibited patriotism over politics. For the most part, it’s been a showcase of our national spirit. After all, we tune into the Olympics to see the brilliance the USA produces, not our deficiencies. And Americans are losing ourselves in the broadcast. Viewership is reportedly up 79% from the Tokyo games in 2021. And social media has turned into a highlight reel, drowning out the silly or cringey moments (the opening ceremony’s drag queen drama feels like five years ago already). There is one important distinction between Paris and Tokyo. The latter was staged during Covid lockdown, to empty stadiums and a neutered energy. There were no families there to cheer on our athletes and provide the magical human element. No live reactions of parents watching their babies reach their wildest dreams. Already this week, I’ve been a gold medalist in decimating boxes of Kleenex as I cry my way through all the warm and fuzzy family coverage. Yesterday we saw gymnast Brody Malone’s father choke up as he read his son a heartfelt letter about their journey to the Olympics. Malone, 24, lost his mother to cancer when he was just 12, and he spoke about how he and his father always tried to maintain stoicism and humility through hardship. Malone and his teammates, including the incredibly likable Frederick “Flips” Richard, had reason to toss all restraint out the window when they won silver — with viral sensation Stephen Nedoroscik providing the exclamation point. Who didn’t fall in love with that Clark Kent in a singlet as he emerged from a stone-faced trance, removed his glasses and dominated that pommel horse? An unlikely hero, he was lifted airborne by his ecstatic teammates. Pure jubilation. A feeling for us all to savor.","summary":"Thank god for the much-needed distraction of pommel horse Clark Kent and the comeback queen.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/opinion/team-usa-are-the-unifying-heroes-our-squabbling-country-needs/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/usa-gymnastics2_720.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=720","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 23:03:30","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.585},{"id":253008316,"title":"The short, strange life of ‘weird’","text":"THE SHORT, STRANGE LIFE OF “WEIRD.” For a brief moment, every Democratic talker in the United States was calling former President Donald Trump and running mate Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH) “weird.” They’re still doing it now, but in the last 24 hours or so, the vogue of “weird” appears to be dwindling. And that leaves the question: What was that about? Several press accounts suggest it got started last week when Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN), who just happens to be on presumptive nominee Vice President Kamala Harris’s short list for running mate, “called Trump and Vance ‘just weird’ in an MSNBC interview, which the Democratic Governors Association, of which Walz is chair, amplified in a post on X,” according to ABC News. Then the Harris campaign, just days in existence, began calling Trump and Vance “weird” on every occasion it could. Last Friday, the campaign sent out a press release headlined “JD Vance Is a Creep (Who Wants to Ban Abortion Nationwide).” The first sentence of the release: “JD Vance is weird.” Subscribe today to the Washington Examiner magazine that will keep you up to date with what’s going on in Washington. SUBSCRIBE NOW: Just $1.00 an issue!By the weekend, shows on MSNBC and CNN were talking about it, giving Walz credit. The head of the Democratic National Committee predicted victory in November in part because its Republican opponents are “weirdos.” Later, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D-MI), who pulled herself out of the vice presidential pool, claimed the “weird” talking point was breaking through because of the Republican agenda and “the way they address people, it is bizarre. It’s weird. It is weird. … And weird is a kind of a funny phrase to use because it’s bizarre.” By then, it seemed that every Democratic official and every Democratic ally in the press was calling the Trump-Vance ticket “weird.” Look at this collection of clips to see one after the other after the other after the other. Does it work? Who knows? The Democrats speaking in unison obviously believe it does. But here’s one very odd thing about it: President Joe Biden, who was the 2024 Democratic candidate until he was deposed by a group of party insiders, based his campaign on the threat he claimed former President Donald Trump posed to democracy. Say what you will about it — and it was basically malarkey, as the president might say — it was serious malarkey. It was a big, deeply solemn accusation. And now? Oooh, they’re weird. As a whole, on cue, the Democratic Party changed the focus of the campaign from saving democracy to saying the other side has cooties. That was an extraordinary decision, to say the least. A few days ago, Politico suggested that Democrats may have de-emphasized democracy in favor of “weird” because democracy just wasn’t selling. Biden, Politico reported, “believed deeply in making the issue of democracy a central theme of the campaign. But the president’s remarks on the subject often featured a grave tone and a heaviness that, more than three years after the January 6, 2021 insurrection, the country had seemingly tuned out. Polls showed voters rated Biden and Trump roughly evenly on questions of which candidate would be better to protect democracy.” That is a big, serious question. With Biden’s charge in mind, voters could see the sitting president advocate removing Supreme Court justices because he did not like their decisions; they could see his Justice Department indicting his opponent not once but twice; they could see Biden’s supporters trying to remove Trump from presidential ballots — they could see all of that and reasonably wonder which candidate would better protect democracy. No wonder people got a little tired of things. So the Harris team thought it might be better to just dump the big, serious Biden campaign theme in favor of … “weird.” There are those who argue that “weird” itself is a serious message. The Atlantic’s David Frum suggested that it was a shrewd campaign appeal directed at millions of women, who will get the anti-Trump, pro-Harris message even if Trump supporters don’t. “‘Weird’ is code for ‘expresses obsessive hostility to women, including the women in his own personal life,'” Frum wrote, “and because MAGA Republicans don’t get the code, they don’t understand why they are losing the argument.” Maybe. A huge gender gap has characterized this entire campaign, with Trump having a big lead among men and Biden having a big lead among women. Through the ouster of Biden, Trump’s lead was a bit bigger than Biden’s, meaning Trump led in polls both nationwide and in key swing states. Maybe “weird” will be the magic word that turns any women who do not already support Trump against the former president. Or maybe not. In any event, now, although it’s never a good idea to speak too soon, it appears the “weird” wave might have crested. Some Trump supporters started posting images of the Biden administration’s celebration of transgenderism, men dressed in women’s clothing reveling on the White House lawn, alongside photos of Vance and his family with the caption “JD Vance is weird.” That led to other sorts of pushback on the “weird” theme. And then the Harris campaign released its first big ad, and it was an entirely conventional case for her candidacy — no “weird,” no memes, just a straight old-fashioned campaign commercial. And now “weird” doesn’t seem to be popping up every second on some media outlets and in social media. So maybe we are approaching the point where it all seems overdone. And then, voters can hope, the campaign can move on to being a campaign.","summary":"THE SHORT, STRANGE LIFE OF &#8220;WEIRD.&#8221; For a brief moment, every Democratic talker in the United States was calling former President Donald Trump and running mate Sen.

The U.S. and Philippine governments have deepened their military alliance since Ferdinand Marcos Jr. became president of the Philippines two years ago. Unlike his predecessor, who favored an opening with China, Marcos has leaned into ties with the United States. Marcos, who lived in Hawaii while his family was in political exile and has met President Joe Biden one-on-one multiple times since taking office, hosted a meeting today of the top diplomatic and military officials from both nations in Manila. It was the first time that such a so-called 2+2 session between the allied nations has taken place in the Philippines. Biden has made alliance-building a hallmark of his foreign policy, especially in Europe and Asia, where different sets of alliances are aimed at countering or deterring military action by two nuclear-armed superpowers that are partners with each other — Russia and China. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin arrived in Manila on Monday night as part of a diplomatic mission to the Indo-Pacific region. The backdrop of the talks in Manila was a fraught one: Not only have Chinese coast guard vessels carried out more hostile actions against Philippine naval ships in recent months in the South China Sea, but Marcos and other Asian leaders are wondering who will take over from Biden as the U.S. president next January. Will it be Kamala Harris, the current vice president and presumed Democratic nominee, or Donald Trump, the former president who says U.S. military alliances are a waste of resources? Marcos remarked to Blinken and Austin on the circumstances of their visit at the presidential palace on this morning. “I am a bit surprised considering how interesting your political situation has become back in the States, but I’m glad that you’ve found the time to come and visit with us,” Marcos said. Blinken, in his remarks, made sure to mention Harris, saying he brought “greetings from President Biden and Vice President Harris along with Secretary Austin.” At an afternoon news conference with Austin and with their Philippine counterparts at Camp Aguinaldo, the headquarters of the Philippine military, Blinken highlighted the $500 million in additional military aid and said it would be used for helping to modernize the Philippine military and the coast guard. Austin said “this level of funding is unprecedented, and it sends a clear message of support for the Philippines from the Biden-Harris administration, the U.S. Congress and the American people.” Under the Biden and Marcos administrations, the first substantial boost to the U.S.-Philippine alliance took place in February 2023, when the governments announced, during a visit by Austin to Manila, that the Philippines had granted the United States access to four additional military bases. The northernmost of those are near Taiwan. The agreement allows the United States to use the bases for humanitarian purposes, but in the event of a war — for instance, a Chinese attempt to invade Taiwan — officials in Manila and Washington could decide that the U.S. military could use the bases for combat support. At the news conference today, Philippine Defense Minister Gilbert Teodoro said his country looked forward to enhancing cooperation on those military bases. It is in the South China Sea where tensions between the Philippines and China are the most heated. For months, Chinese coast guard vessels tried to keep Philippine naval ships from bringing supplies to marines posted at the Sierra Madre, a grounded ship on the Second Thomas Shoal, a submerged reef. Both China and the Philippines claim the area as their territory. Chinese coast guard vessels have rammed Philippine ships and fired water cannons at them; in one episode, two ships hitting each other resulted in the severing of a Philippine sailor’s thumb. Austin stressed at the news conference that the mutual defense clause of the U.S.-Philippine treaty applies to actions against the forces of both of those countries in the South China Sea. China and the Philippines signed an agreement last week in which China would allow the Philippine navy to run resupply missions to the Sierra Madre. There have been some questions on whether the two governments have clashing interpretations of the agreement, but the Philippines was able to run a resupply mission on Saturday to the grounded ship without harassment by Chinese vessels. Blinken said that at a meeting he had in Vientiane, Laos, on Saturday with Wang Yi, China’s top foreign policy official, he told Wang that China had to refrain from hostilities against the Philippines in the South China Sea. At their stops in Tokyo and Manila, Blinken, Austin and their aides have coordinated with foreign counterparts to issue strong messages pushing back against China’s assertive territorial moves. In Tokyo on Monday, Blinken and three foreign ministers from the so-called Quad countries that have a nonmilitary partnership — Japan, India, Australia and the United States — issued a joint statement that, among other things, denounced military aggression in the South and East China seas. Like a similar statement that the ministers issued last year in New Delhi, this one did not name China, but it was clear they were referring to that country. “We are seriously concerned about the situation in the East and South China Seas and reiterate our strong opposition to any unilateral actions that seek to change the status quo by force or coercion,” the four top diplomats said in the latest Quad statement. “We continue to express our serious concern about the militarization of disputed features, and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea,” they said. “We also express our serious concern about the dangerous use of coast guard and maritime militia vessels, the increasing use of various kinds of dangerous maneuvers, and efforts to disrupt other countries’ offshore resource exploitation activities.” As in New Delhi in 2023, because the statement did not name China, it was not as strong as it could have been. Some countries in Asia want a robust U.S. military, diplomatic and economic presence in the region as a counterweight to China, but at the same time they want to avoid provoking China, which is rapidly building up its military — and especially its navy — while being the largest trading partner for many Asian nations. The Quad is an example of the Biden administration taking a moribund multilateral partnership and reinvigorating it. The administration has also created new latticeworks of trilateral military partnerships. It has done this with Japan and South Korea, and with Japan and the Philippines. Leaders announced the latter in April, when Marcos and Fumio Kishida, the prime minister of Japan, visited Biden at the White House. On Sunday, during the first day of their visit to Japan, Blinken and Austin also held a meeting with Japanese counterparts on extended deterrence, the term that refers to deterrence protection provided to nonnuclear-armed nations by the U.S. nuclear umbrella. It was the first time that a session on extended deterrence had been scheduled outside of the regular 2+2 conference, underscoring the growing anxieties over possible military conflict in the Asia-Pacific region. After the news conference at Camp Aguinaldo, Blinken stopped by an artisanal chocolate shop, Auro, on his way to the airport to fly to Singapore. Blinken is visiting six nations on his 18th trip to the Indo-Pacific region. He tasted both chocolate and pandesal, a Philippine bread, this one stuffed with ube, a paste of purple yam, and sipped from a cup of mocha. He walked away from this final stop in Manila with a gift box of chocolates from the owner, Mark Ocampo.

When you consider that upbringing, it makes sense that Abraham would have the kind of voice that forces you into the present, makes you want to close your eyes and simply feel; that his songs wouldn't shy away from revealing the rawest, most relatable truths about identity and faith. The 39-year-old's remarkable sound captured the attention of industry heavyweights before he'd even released his first album, with both Sara Bareilles and Gotye featuring on his 2014 debut. And over the last decade, artists including Kesha (whom he performed with at the Grammys in 2018), Demi Lovato and Ben Platt have called upon Abraham to pen songs for them in between his own award-winning releases. Just wait until you hear the goss about the song he wrote for Jessica Mauboy to sing at Eurovision a few years back. The now-LA-based singer revealed this and a whole lot more in a Chit Chat with ABC Entertainment ahead of his first Sydney show since 2018. What's the last book you read? Yasmin … Starting with a tough question! Wait … I'm going to answer this but I need to think about what the last book I read was [laughs]… Hang on, let me think… I can ask a different question or we can come back to this one? No … no, no … this is great… OK, yes! It was Liu Cixin's The Three-Body Problem, back in March. That's how often I read [laughs]. What was the last photo you took and can we see it? [Laughs] It was a selfie of me eating a kebab after my gig last night. What about the last screenshot you took? I have a friend who's cat-sitting, looking after my cats back in LA while I'm in Australia and I got a notification from my HBO Max account saying, \"Your new profile has been created\" and I took a screenshot of the email and sent it to them to make sure it was them. What I took from that is that you have multiple cats, which is amazing I do, Yasmin. That's where I'm at in my life. I have two, they're both ragdoll cats. The first one was a pandemic get. He's called Bilby and he is very shy, he's sort of adopted my personality. If anyone comes over, he runs and hides under the bed. But if no one's over, he's very needy and won't leave me alone. And then the other one is called Fozzie. I got him about a year after Bilby and he is a total extrovert. He's a little white fluffball who just does whatever he wants, wherever he wants. Can you tell us the story behind your cover of your parent's song Kidung and what singing with them was like? So, Kidung is a song my uncle wrote and my parents [Bram and Dianne Manusama] recorded in Indonesia in 1978. It won a big radio competition and ended up becoming quite a hit song that was later re-recorded in the 80s or 90s by this Indonesian pop superstar. So the song is a very famous song in Indonesia. If people are older, they know it as my parents' song but if they're a little younger, they know it as this guy Chrisye's song. My dad is Indonesian, and growing up, he really wanted me and my siblings to feel Australian. So, we were raised not speaking Indonesian … I mean, we would eat Indonesian food at home and my mum speaks fluent Indonesian, but we were basically raised as white kids surrounded by white kids and white culture. I feel a certain sadness over the fact I didn't really engage with my Indonesian heritage in a meaningful way when I was younger. As I've gotten older, I've found myself engaging more with Indonesia, my Indonesianness and the fact that I am Asian. I've wanted to do a version of Kidung for a really long time and then my parents happened to be visiting me in LA earlier in the year and for fun I was like, \"We should do a little video on Instagram of us singing the chorus of Kidung.\" And my parents are always up for anything, so we did it and it became the most viral thing that has happened to me, which is so crazy to me. So I was like, \"Well obviously I have to put the cover out.\" Both my parents are just so thrilled, it's been very nostalgic for them, because that really was a life they'd left behind. By the time [their kids] were born, they were so involved in church and they weren't really doing music like that anymore. So, seeing one of their kids engaging with that part of their life that they had put to rest has been quite moving for them. Can we expect more music from you in Indonesian? Yeah, definitely. My dream would be to go over and make my next full album on the island my dad grew up on. What are your current feelings on 'monetising your pain' by making music about it, as you sing in 'Never Been Better'? I think the music industry is in such a bizarre moment of commodifying trauma and I think there's a fine line between exploiting [your trauma] to sell records and just telling the truth about yourself when you're a musician. The lyric [\"I'm trying to work out the game / To sing the truth of my life / And monetising my pain\"] is definitely a sarcastic push at that idea. I feel very thankful that I let go of the ambition I had when I was younger for what a certain version of success looks like. And now I can just enjoy making music and I don't feel like I'm chasing that stuff. If I was younger and more insecure [and trying to make it in the industry in its current state], I'd be terrified at the thought of how I'd try and exploit my own trauma and pain to try and sell a song. What was coming out later in life like for you? Part of the hesitation I felt around it was, of course, the religious upbringing I had and societal pressures around men and masculinity. Of course that stuff was at play. But there was also a layer of just feeling a bit boxed-in by any kind of public declaration of who I am. It's like, \"Well, I don't know who I am. I don't know who I'm going to fall in love with tomorrow. I don't know who I'm going to be with over my life.\" I so believe that sexuality is a spectrum and I know I place along it. My experience of attraction and of sexuality is layered — as is everyone's — but I've always felt frustrated by some of the binaries we can get into. I sort of did it publicly on Instagram … By that point, the people closest to me already knew. The public post felt important because my album [2022's Friendly Fire] was so much about it and I wanted to be able to talk about the things on the record. I thought of it like a formality more than anything — what I wasn't expecting was what a profound impact that post had on me. It just freed me from any sense of having to live up to anyone's expectations. It was very beautifully put. I'm wondering what advice you'd give to anyone struggling with the relationship between their spirituality and their sexuality? [Sighs] My answer is going to sound a little bit religious for people but I guess I'm speaking to people who already have that world view. I think, if you believe in God, and that's been a core part of who you are, then let that be the centre. And if God is real, he has a way forward for you. Even if you don't know what it is right now, start putting one foot in front of the other and just trust that if he's real, it'll all work out. So, don't feel like you have to walk away [from your faith] to explore and understand who you are. You can bring God along for that journey. OK, that was the last hard question. The rest are fun, I hope. The book one so far was the hardest question, to be honest. What was your number one most listened to song last year? Oh gosh, I have to tell you something: I don't really listen to music. Something happened to me about seven years ago … working in music, I just stopped listening to it for pleasure. But every now and then there are songs I come across that really resonate with me and I kind of play them to death. Right now it's this song 'Saudade, saudade' by this Portuguese artist called Maro. That was a Eurovision song! Yeah, that's right! See, Eurovision has good songs. Oh, I know! I actually wrote a song for Jess Mauboy to sing at Eurovision in 2018, with Alex Hope. They chose We Got Love in the end, which wasn't our song. She would have won if they'd chosen our song… What's the last thing you saw online that made you laugh? It was one of the Kamala Harris Brat memes. Someone cut Charli xcx's 360 song with Kamala's laugh becoming the synth line. What can people expect from your upcoming Sydney gig? Rather than craft a set, I'll have a bowl on stage with me filled with cards with categories and the categories are: new song, old song, cover song, song that I've written for someone else, and song that has a good story. And so I'll be picking a card and then I'll choose a song and explain why I'm playing it. So it'll be very fun and relaxed and chill and I'm very excited about it.

Now a tidal wave of Kamalaflage has engulfed the presidential contest, as Harris’ entire career is being miraculously expunged — or at least purified — in a craven evidence-rigging stampede by media outlets and supposedly nonpartisan scorekeepers. Harris plainly ascended to the nomination thanks to a de facto coup of Democratic Party kingpins and donors. Yet The Washington Post on Sunday hailed those machinations as “the most spectacular transformation in recent American political history, a flashbang midsummer swap at the top of the presidential ticket.” Perhaps the paper should change its motto to “Democracy dies as a spectator sport,” given its effusive praise for the Democrats’ willingness to sideline their own primary voters. In 2019, Harris was hell-bent on a national fracking ban that could have crippled US energy production. When Trump bashed her on that last week, she recanted — but Politico headlined its coverage with “Harris Campaign Pledges She Won’t Ban Fracking After Trump Accusation,” implying that Trump had slandered her. “Centrist Democrat” is the label of the moment for Team Kamala apologists, and even supposedly neutral sources are falling in line. Govtrack, one of the most frequently quoted sources in Washington, boasts on its web page its mission of “tracking the US Congress to make our government more open and accessible.” Except when that tracking could cost a Democrat votes. In 2019, GovTrack labeled Kamala Harris the “most liberal” senator — further to the left than even Bernie Sanders — but this month deleted the webpage that said so. “A single year was not sufficient to create a reliable portrait of the activity of legislators,” GovTrack founder Joshua Tauberer declared. Perhaps Harris was taken hostage in 2019 and an impostor cast senate votes for endless budget-busting boondoggles in her name, but Tauberer offered no evidence of such a switch. Are we also obliged to forget that Kamala’s hard-left positions helped wreck her gold-plated first presidential run — which failed to win a single Democratic delegate? In 2020, as looters and arsonists ravaged Minneapolis after the killing of George Floyd, then-Sen. Harris urged people to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund “to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota.” Her appeal effectively exonerated anyone committing violence or other crimes, portraying them as worthy of speedy release from jail — but the bail fund paid to release rapists and child molesters and future murderers, not just looters. Yet a CBS News analysis last week absolved Kamala of all blame because she did not personally donate to the fund. No matter that her tweet urging contributions to the Freedom Fund was shared more than 15,000 times. The height of media sycophancy — so far — is their vehement denial that Kamala was ever Biden’s “border czar.” USA Today, CNN, Axios, Time and other outlets joined to effectively exonerate her of blame for the 10 million or more illegal immigrants who have arrived since 2021 — apparently because the administration never printed up letterhead stationery with “Border Czar” as the veep’s official title. In his televised farewell mumble last week, Biden sought to bury Harris’ failure by falsely claiming, “Border crossings are lower today than when the previous administration left office” — despite online videos of vast convoys of illegal immigrants lining up to cross the southern border like they’re queuing for a ride at Disney World. Last July, as Harris spearheaded the administration’s attack on Florida’s effort to block fabricated 1619-style versions of history in public schools, she promised, “I will always stand up for fundamental freedoms, including the freedom to learn and teach America’s full history.” But neither Harris nor Biden has given Americans the freedom to understand the backroom dealings that have driven federal policy since they took office. (Could they at least tell us who is controlling the presidency these days?) Will the fate of Kamala’s campaign hinge on an intellectual Keystone Kops chase, as her bootlickers rush to vaporize her past faster than voters can recognize her deceits? Does Kamala’s path-breaking candidacy entitle her to achieve the Oval Office “unburdened by what has been” her life record? On Monday, The New York Times provided a Bidenesque absolution for every wacky position that Kamala ever took, helpfully explaining that during her 2020 presidential run, “Ms. Harris also often appeared as if she were not sure what she believed.” Republicans will never be able to make a case against someone who was an innocent bystander to her own career.

However, during the interview, both Trump and Rosenberg took aim at Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate following President Joe Biden's drop from the 2024 presidential race, as they spoke about the Jewish voters following Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the U.S.In the interview, Rosenberg, a conservative radio personality that has a controversial history, began to criticize the second gentleman, calling him \"a crappy Jew,\" as Trump appeared to agree.\"He's Jewish like Bernie Sanders is Jewish. Are you kidding me? He's a crappy Jew,\" Rosenberg declared.\"Yeah,\" Trump said as the conversation continued to critique Harris on various other issues.The comments come after Trump, in Tuesday's interview, suggested that Harris appeared uncomfortable during her recent meeting with Netanyahu.\"You can see the disdain,\" Trump said. \"She doesn't like Israel. She doesn't like Jewish people. Everyone knows it, but no one wants to say it.\"In addition, Trump reiterated his criticism of Jewish voters who support Democrats, declaring that they \"should have their head examined\" and labeling them \"fools\" for their political choices.Newsweek has reached out to Trump's and Harris' campaign via email for comment.In response to Trump's remarks, James Singer, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign said in a statement to the Associated Press (AP), \"America is better than the fear, hate, and despicable insults of Donald Trump. Vice President Harris believes Americans want a president who unites our country, uses the power of the presidency to help families, and has a vision for our future.\"Trump has a history of controversial remarks about Jewish voters, including a statement in March accusing Jews who vote for Democrats of hating Israel and their religion, the AP reported.Tuesday's interview comes just days after Trump accused Harris of antisemitism in a speech on Friday at The Believers' Summit which was hosted in Palm Beach, Florida, by Turning Point Action, the campaigning arm of conservative group Turning Point USA.\"Two days ago she refused to attend the speech in Congress of the prime minister of Israel. She said 'Oh I can't make it.' It was just a small group of people but they couldn't make it because that's her original thought. That's where she comes from. She doesn't like Jewish people. She doesn't like Israel. That's the way it is, and that's the way it's always going to be. She's not going to change,\" Trump said.The vice president skipped Netanyahu's speech to the U.S. Congress last week as she was traveling in Indiana during that time, but did meet with the Israeli leader in a separate meeting the next day.Trump's remarks come as the former President seeks to highlight the divisions within the Democratic Party over the Israel-Hamas conflict as some Democratic leaders decided not to attend Netanyahu's speech last week, citing divisions over the war.Israel is currently at the tenth-month mark of its war against Hamas, which began after Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people. Israel subsequently launched its heaviest-ever airstrikes in Gaza. More than 39,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, the AP said. The rising death toll has led to international calls for a ceasefire.Meanwhile, Emhoff, who grew up in Brooklyn, New York, with two Jewish parents, is the first Jewish spouse of a nationally elected U.S. leader and has been a prominent figure in the Biden administration's efforts to combat antisemitism.He has visibly embraced Jewish traditions, such as hanging mezuzahs at the vice president's residence and leading Passover celebrations at the White House.Meanwhile, Harris, who was raised Christian, has also embraced the multi-faith aspect of her family.In a statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day on May 6, Harris said, \"Doug and I have been proud to hang mezuzahs, light menorahs, and host Passover seders. And with each of these actions, we send a message to the world: the Jewish people can overcome evil. We can and we must stand strong in the face of hate.\"In addition, since her public endorsement from Biden, prominent pro-Israel lawmakers spoke to Jewish Insider to show their support for Harris and defend her record on antisemitism.","summary":"Donald Trump took aim at Kamala Harris in an interview on Tuesday as he spoke about Jewish voters.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-agrees-kamala-harris-husband-crappy-jew-interview-1932363","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2439502/kamala-harris-doug-emhoff.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:54:54","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.32},{"id":253009498,"title":"Project 2025 director steps down amid backlash from Trump","text":"(CNN) — The director of Project 2025, the conservative blueprint for a potential second Donald Trump term, has stepped down amid intense criticism including from the former president. Paul Dans, a former top adviser in Trump’s administration, steered Project 2025 as it carved a leading role in shaping discourse around what conservatives dreamed they could accomplish if Republicans won back the White House. While a source with knowledge of the planning said Project 2025 would be effectively ending its policy operations, others familiar with the matter noted that it was always the plan to move on to the next phase now – and efforts to build a conservative personnel apparatus would continue. Project 2025’s plans to radically reshape the federal government and American life, spelled out in detail in an exhaustive 900-page playbook, provided ample fodder for Democrats to warn against Trump’s return to power. In recent months, Trump has lashed out against Project 2025, calling some of its ideas “absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.” He strained to distance himself from the work, claiming he had “no idea who is behind it.” Top Trump adviser Chris LaCivita recently referred to Project 2025 as “a pain the a**” for the Trump campaign. Dans’ departure was confirmed in a statement to CNN Tuesday by Dr. Kevin Roberts, the president of the Heritage Foundation, the group that launched Project 2025. In addition to stepping down from Project 2025, Dans is also leaving the Heritage Foundation. “Under Paul Dans’ leadership, Project 2025 has completed exactly what it set out to do: bringing together over 110 leading conservative organizations to create a unified conservative vision, motivated to devolve power from the unelected administrative state, and returning it to the people,” Roberts said. “This tool was built for any future administration to use.” LaCivita and Susie Wiles, both Trump campaign managers, said in a statement that the Trump team “has been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the President in any way.” They continued, “Reports of Project 2025’s demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you.” A spokesperson for Heritage, though, said despite Dans’ exit, work will continue on the current phase of Project 2025, which is a nationwide search to fill a Trump administration with loyal conservatives. Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign made clear Tuesday that the change of leadership will not stop its efforts to share Project 2025’s contents with voters. Harris has made criticizing Project 2025 a centerpiece of her early campaign for the presidency, picking up right where President Joe Biden left off. “Project 2025 is on the ballot because Donald Trump is on the ballot,” Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez said. “This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country. Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real – in fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding.” Project 2025 includes many policy priorities that are aligned with those of the former president, especially as they relate to cracking down on immigration and purging the federal bureaucracy by making it easier to dismiss civil servants and career officials. But Project 2025 has lately become a lightning rod for other ideas Trump hasn’t explicitly backed. Within the group’s seminal work, “Mandate for Leadership,” are plans to ban pornography, reverse federal approval of the abortion pill mifepristone, exclude the morning-after pill and men’s contraceptives from coverage mandated under the Affordable Care Act, make it harder for transgender adults to transition and eliminate the federal agency that oversees the National Weather Service. Its detailed plans also run counter to Trump’s push for a streamlined GOP platform absent any language that Democrats could wield against Republicans this cycle. Still, Trump’s efforts to keep the organization at arm’s length were complicated by his close ties to the people behind it. At least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had a hand in the project, a CNN review found, including more than half of the people listed as authors, editors and contributors to “Mandate for Leadership.” Nobody embodied the shift from Trump insider to Project 2025 champion more than Dans. Dans served as chief of staff at the US Office of Personnel Management during the Trump administration where he served as a liaison between the agency and the White House. He told a gathering of conservative broadcasters earlier this year in Nashville that he intended to work for Trump again if he win. He has also assured Trump’s supporters that Project 2025 would become a reality if the former president returned to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. In June, he told former Trump adviser Steve Bannon’s “War Room” podcast that Project 2025 was “gonna be a D-Day invasion plan” and urged listeners to “flood the zone with us.” “We’re going to make this happen under President Trump,” Dans said. “And this is ultimately his direction and his team’s direction.” (Copyright (c) 2024 CNN.

Town officials broke the development Tuesday afternoon while Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff visited the island to attend a presidential campaign fundraiser for his wife Kamala Harris. The announcement came after GE Vernova informed town officials Monday that “several sections” of the already broken 351-foot turbine blade detached from the turbine, with some large pieces entering the water column and other smaller pieces floating on the surface. “I hope while he’s here he takes a look around, talks to people, and maybe brings back the message that we should at the very least shut them down until we get some real answers,” Nantucket resident Amy DiSibio said of Emhoff’s visit in an interview with the Herald. DiSibio was referring to the island’s desire for the feds to completely shut down the Vineyard Wind project, which has left Nantucket a debris mess since the blade failure sparked on July 13. GE Vernova, the designer, manufacturer, and installer of the turbines, said last week that the failure stemmed from a “manufacturing deviation – in this case, insufficient bonding.” The vague description and uncertainty surrounding the blade failure’s impacts have residents worried and searching for answers, said DiSibio, a member of the ACK4Whales group fighting the project. “According to GE Vernova, this detachment was not unexpected, though it has been several days since any debris detachment was last observed’ town officials wrote in a Monday evening update. The Biden-Harris administration’s quick approval of Vineyard Wind – an anticipated 62-turbine, 806-megawatt wind farm – is the subject of a dispute in Boston federal appeals court with two fishermen groups trying to toss the project’s underlying permit and arguing regulators failed to analyze the development’s impacts. A month after Biden and Harris took office, the administration decided to restart permitting for the $4-billion Vineyard Wind endeavor. The Trump administration delayed the process due to concerns turbines would negatively impact commercial fishing. Emhoff was an honored guest at an island fundraising event hosted by Laura DeBonis, a business and nonprofit technical consultant who previously worked for Google, and Ken Jarin, a partner at a Washington, D.C. law firm, according to the Nantucket Inquirer and Mirror. The New England Fisherman’s Stewardship Association highlighted in a release how Vineyard Wind is a beneficiary of the Inflation Reduction Action, which the group called “the signature domestic policy achievement of the Biden-Harris administration.” Vineyard Wind in October 2023 was backed by a $1.2 billion investment transaction between its parent companies Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners and Avangrid, a member of Spanish renewable energy company, Iberdrola Group. “We have people in positions who are disconnected with what our resources and waters provide,” NEFA CEO Jerry Leeman told the Herald. “It’s becoming more and more blatantly obvious. We’ve got a lot of assumptions and not enough facts and when things like this happen we’re over here playing the blame game.”","summary":"Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff visited Nantucket for a campaign fundraiser for his wife, Kamala Harris, on Tuesday, while fishermen and island residents continue to fight for answers from the feds on the Vineyard Wind mess.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/07/30/vp-harris-hubby-stumps-on-nantucket-residents-fight-for-answers-on-vineyard-wind-mess/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Nantucket-turbine.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:48:48","author":"Lance Reynolds","authors":["Lance Reynolds"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.122},{"id":253007462,"title":"Project 2025 director ends work on plan for Trump presidency after continued attack from Democrats","text":"The director of the 'Project 2025' plan for a Donald Trump presidency has stepped down after Democrats made attacking it central to their election campaign and Trump repeatedly distanced himself from it. Paul Dans, who predicted Project 2025 would become \"the engine room of the next administration\" in a recent interview with the ABC's Four Corners, will leave the initiative in August. Kamala Harris and, before her, Joe Biden had been frequently targeting Project 2025 on the campaign trail, highlighting its more radical proposals to expand presidential power and reshape government. That prompted Trump to declare he had \"nothing to do with\" the project, though many of the people who worked on it were his allies, including scores of his former staff. Mr Dans served as chief of staff in the Office of Personnel Management in the Trump administration. \"This is his agenda, written by his allies, for Donald Trump to inflict on our country,\" Harris campaign manager Julie Chavez Rodriguez insisted in a statement after today's announcement. But the Trump campaign said it had \"been very clear for over a year that Project 2025 had nothing to do with the campaign, did not speak for the campaign, and should not be associated with the campaign or the president in any way\". \"Reports of Project 2025's demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you.\" The Heritage Foundation think tank, which led Project 2025 in conjunction with more than 100 other conservative groups, said Mr Dans's work overseeing it was always due to end about now. But an anonymous former Heritage Foundation aide said it was almost certain the Trump campaign had forced the shake-up. Trump campaign representatives did not respond to messages inquiring about whether the campaign pushed for Mr Dans to step down. Mr Dans didn't immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. What is Project 2025? Also known as the 'Presidential Transition Project', Project 2025 is spelled out in an almost 1,000-page document. Loading... One of the most controversial proposals involves replacing thousands of traditionally apolitical public servants with Trump loyalists. \"We have a database with over 10,000 people from all walks of life entering into this, aspiring to serve,\" Mr Dans told Four Corners. The proposal lines up with Trump's own plan, outlined on his campaign website, to \"shatter the deep state\". He has vowed to revive a 2020 executive order to reclassify public servants working in policy roles as \"Schedule F\" employees, effectively turning them into political appointments. That would strip job protections from potentially tens of thousands of government workers, making it easy for the president to sack them. Project 2025's other proposals include: eliminating government programs focused on climate protection and racial and gender equitypursuing abortion bans at all levels of government, and removing the mifepristone abortion bill from the marketdisbanding government agencies including the Department of Educationscaling back social welfare programs such as food-stamp support and Medicaid health insurance In July, Trump said \"some of the things\" proposed by Project 2025 were \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal\". \"Anything they do, I wish them luck, but I have nothing to do with them,\" he wrote on social media. But a CNN analysis later found at least 140 people who worked in the Trump administration had contributed to Project 2025, including at least six of his former cabinet secretaries. In 2018, the Heritage Foundation said Trump had embraced nearly two-thirds of its 2016 blueprint within a year of taking office. The Harris campaign said Trump and Project 2025 had been working hand in glove. \"Hiding the 920-page blueprint from the American people doesn’t make it less real,\" it said. \"In fact, it should make voters more concerned about what else Trump and his allies are hiding.\" Heritage Foundation president Kevin Roberts said the project had \"completed exactly what it set out to do: bringing together over 110 leading conservative organisations to create a unified conservative vision, motivated to devolve power from the unelected administrative state, and returning it to the people\".

(AP) — A day after confirming he wouldn’t be a candidate for Vice President Kamala Harris’ running mate, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper said Tuesday at a public event that he’s excited that Democrats “have a lot of great options for her to choose from.” Speaking in coastal Brunswick County with U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan to celebrate federal funding for land conservation, Cooper reiterated his Monday message by saying “this was not the right time for our state or for me to potentially be on a national ticket.” Cooper, barred by term limits from seeking reelection this year, had been among roughly a dozen potential contenders that Harris’ team was initially looking at for a vice presidential pick. He’s been a surrogate for President Joe Biden’s reelection bid and now for Harris. “I am going to work every day to see that she is elected,” Cooper told WECT-TV. “I believe that she will win, and I look forward to this campaign because she has the right message and she is the right person for this country.” In making his decision, Cooper confirmed Tuesday that he was concerned in part about what Republican Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson could do if he left the state to campaign as part of the Democratic ticket. The state constitution says that “during the absence of the Governor from the State … the Lieutenant Governor shall be Acting Governor.” Robinson is running for governor this fall. “We had concerns that he would try to seize the limelight because there would be a lot, if I were the vice presidential candidate, on him, and that would be a real distraction to the presidential campaign,” Cooper said. Cooper pointed to when he traveled to Japan last fall on an economic development trip. As acting governor at the time, Robinson held a news conference during his absence to announce he had issued a “NC Solidarity with Israel Week” proclamation after the Oct. 7 Hamas attack inside the country. Cooper withdrew from contention well before Harris’ vetting process began, according to two people familiar with the matter and who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive search process. Tuesday’s event at Green Swamp Preserve celebrated a $421 million grant for projects in North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland to reduce climate pollution.

The proposals include introducing term limits for justices and creating a binding code of ethics for the court. Biden also proposed overturning the Supreme Court's recent ruling that broadened presidential immunity, arguing instead that former presidents should have no immunity for crimes they committed while in office.Supreme Court reform has become a bi-partisan issue following a string of controversies involving conservative Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas. The high court adopted its first code of ethics last fall, although critics argue more action is needed to make sure justices are held to the standards.Biden promised to focus on Supreme Court reform in his final six months in office during his first address to the nation after suspending his reelection campaign. But Litman, senior legal affairs columnist at The Los Angeles Times, wrote in an op-ed piece on Tuesday that there \"is no chance of action on Biden's proposals in the coming month, and the administration well understands that point.\"\"Why then choose now to introduce them?\" Litman asked. \"...The straightforward explanation for the timing is to make the Supreme Court, now quite possibly the most unpopular of all federal governmental institutions, a focus of the election, which would presumably nudge voters toward Vice President Kamala Harris.\"Harris was endorsed by Biden after he dropped out of the 2024 election, and has quickly earned the support of her fellow Democrats. The vice president backed Biden's proposal for Supreme Court reform on Monday.Litman added in his op-ed that Biden's proposals were more than \"a mere political gesture\" in the last 100 days or so of the election.\"Biden and the Democrats are also playing the long game, looking in particular to make the court a campaign issue,\" he wrote. \"Then if they win control of both chambers and the White House, they can portray their election as a mandate for substantial reforms.\"It is likely that Biden's proposals would have to be implemented as constitutional amendments, meaning that they would have to pass both chambers of Congress by two-thirds. House Speaker and Republican Mike Johnson told a reporter on Monday that reforms would be \"dead on arrival in the House.\"Other experts have seemingly agreed with Litman's stance. Thomas Gift, the founding director of the Centre on U.S. Politics at University College London, previously told Newsweek that Biden's High Court reform was a \"symbolic gesture designed more to appease the progressive left.\"University of Illinois law professor Steven Schwinn also recently told AFP that while Biden has a \"close to zero\" chance of passing his reform proposals, the president is likely attempting to \"raise public consciousness\" and \"introduce the Supreme Court as an election issue.\"Newsweek reached out to Harris' campaign via email on Tuesday for comment.Trust in the Supreme Court fell to its lowest point in decades after the justices ruled to overturn Roe v. Wade in June 2022, ending federal protections for abortion. The conservative majority, which has three justices who were appointed by Trump, has also faced backlash after a series of controversial rulings issued just before the end of its term earlier this month.Reproductive rights have proven to be a winning issue for Democrats since the fall of Roe—while abortion has become a major topic point for Harris' campaign, Trump appears to still be struggling to win over women voters.","summary":"A legal analyst opined Biden aims to paint Supreme Court reform as an election issue to assist Kamala Harris in November.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/biden-long-game-supreme-court-kamala-harris-legal-analyst-1932354","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2439499/biden-playing-long-game-supreme-courtmove.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:27:24","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":253006132,"title":"Trump remains the favorite in 2024 presidential race despite Harris’ rise: Nate Silver","text":"Even after Democrats dramatically moved to re-top their presidential ticket and got an apparent jolt of momentum, famed election analyst and statistical guru Nate Silver still deems former President Donald Trump the favorite. His election forecast model gives Trump a 61.3% chance of prevailing in the Electoral College, while Vice President Kamala Harris is at 38.1%. Silver previously pegged Trump with a 65.7% chance of victory over President Biden during his model rollout last month. In his most recent assessment, Silver included a slew of polling averages that gave Trump slight advantages nationally and in most of the battleground states, albeit not in Wisconsin, where Harris was ahead. Still, Silver’s analysis showed Harris rapidly gaining ground on Trump in most polling. His model also gave Harris a 53.5% chance of winning the popular vote compared to Trump’s 46.5% chance. Last month, his assessment, which was based on 40,000 simulations run through the model, pegged Biden with a 47.2% chance of edging out Trump (47.1%) with the national popular vote. The last Republican presidential candidate to win the popular vote was George W. Bush when he secured re-election in 2004. Silver touted his model as a “direct descendent” of the FiveThirtyEight election forecast. Silver founded FiveThirtyEight, which is named after the 538 votes available in the Electoral College, and departed from it last year. FiveThirtyEight had been one of the rare election forecasts that projected Biden was most likely to emerge victorious in the 2024 presidential election. It suspended its forecast after Biden abruptly dropped out of the race on July 21. Biden promptly endorsed Harris who quickly became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, scrambling the 2024 contest. Harris’ favorability ratings in a flurry of polls quickly shot upward and the recently rebranded Harris for President campaign touted a roughly $200 million haul within less than a week of Biden’s exit. Preliminary polling has generally shown tightening in the race, but less than 100 days out from election night, pollsters are racing to recalibrate for the new dynamics of the contest. Trump retains a two percentage point edge nationally in the latest RealClearPolitics aggregate of polls, but battleground state polling is still somewhat light compared to the litany of surveys scoring a Trump v. Biden matchup. “Roughly speaking, the strategy of the Harris campaign should be to triangulate the strategy of Hillary 2016, the Harris 2020 primary campaign, and Biden 2024, and do the exact opposite, Silver quipped on X. Silver had been among the chorus of voices publicly encouraging Biden to step aside amid concerns about his mental acuity. He gained notoriety after successfully predicting 49 of 50 states in the 2008 presidential election and was further vaulted to prominence by his prediction of President Barack Obama’s 2012 victory. Back in 2016, his model favored Hillary Clinton to prevail against Trump, but in 2020, his last forecast gave Biden an 89% chance of victory. Harris is now rushing to select a running mate as the Democrats’ planned virtual roll call to coronate their nominee is fast approaching. Following the virtual roll call, Democrats will then hold their national convention in Chicago from Aug. 19-22.","summary":"Even after Democrats dramatically moved to re-top their presidential ticket and got an apparent jolt of momentum, famed election analyst and statistical guru Nate Silver is still deeming former President Donald Trump the favorite.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/trump-remains-the-favorite-in-2024-presidential-race-despite-harris-rise-nate-silver/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/86494736.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/KR4DxkUF-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:15:07","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":253007874,"title":"Cincinnati Bengals Say Joe Burrow Was Not on 'White Dudes for Kamala Harris' Zoom Call","text":"On Tuesday, rumors began swirling that Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Joe Burrow was seen on the “white dudes for Kamala Harris” campaign call.

The Ohio Republican and GOP vice presidential nominee, speaking before a packed gymnasium of several thousands at Liberty High School here, argued that Harris, 59, played an outsized role in the current administration because of President Biden’s cognitive decline. “Kamala Harris owns every failure of the Biden administration over the last four years,” Vance told the crowd. “He didn’t know what was going on,” he said of the 81-year-old president. “So somebody was calling the shots, and we know it was Kamala Harris.” Vance, 39, accused Harris, who’s likely to secure the Democratic nomination for president next week, of being responsible for the crisis of the southern border and record-high inflation under Biden – urging Nevadans to elect former President Donald Trump in November to “take our country back.” Inflation and immigration are regularly listed as top concerns for voters heading into Election Day. The “Hillbilly Elegy” author further alleged that Harris helped “cover up” Biden’s “declining mental capacity for years,” calling it the “worst of all” her “faults.” “Anyone who is too blind to see Biden’s incompetence, or more likely, too dishonest to admit it, is not fit to serve as commander in chief of this country,” Vance asserted, referring to the vice president. Vance’s appearance in Henderson – a booming suburb of Las Vegas – was one of two stops Trump’s running mate was scheduled to make in the key swing state on Tuesday. The Ohio senator is slated to hold a rally in Reno, Nev., in the evening. A Redfield & Wilton Strategies poll released last week showed Trump leading Harris in Nevada by 2 percentage points. The Silver State went for Biden in the 2020 election by less than 3 points. Karie Harwood was one of many who trekked across the Las Vegas valley to see the Republican vice presidential nominee. Was she concerned about Democratic criticisms of Vance’s “childless cat lady“ remarks? “I think it’s garbage,” she told The Post. “Because I think a lot of people have taken simple things that he said – that didn’t, that didn’t mean it as that – and they’ve turned it into something else.” “I came to see JD Vance’s heart,” said retiree Patricia Robertson of Las Vegas, calling him “a good guy.” Physicist Wayne Moore of Henderson said he believes the GOP presidential ticket will carry the Silver State for the first time in two decades. “I see a movement that is so strong that I don’t think there’s any way can be overcome,” he told The Post in Nevada. “Now the down ticket is a more concern. But the Trump and JD I think they’re a cinch.” In a marked contrast to most Democratic events in the state, an overflow crowd of hundreds packed out the high school’s cafeteria to hear Vance speak. Trump, 78, did not attend the rally, but his supporters waited in 95 degree heat to get past security checkpoints for the chance to listen to his running mate.","summary":"The Ohio Republican and GOP vice presidential nominee, speaking before a packed gymnasium of several thousands at Liberty High School in Henderson, Nev., argued that Harris, 59, played an outsized role in the current administration because of President Biden’s cognitive decline. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/30/us-news/jd-vance-charges-that-kamala-harris-is-calling-the-shots-in-the-white-house/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/2024-henderson-nevada-vance-traveling-86496825.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TPnkuS3r-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:06:55","author":"Mark Kellner,Victor Nava","authors":["Mark Kellner","Victor Nava"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.524},{"id":253006774,"title":"Vance attacks ‘dangerously liberal’ Harris while touting his own family roots","text":"Sen. J.D. Vance (R-OH), former President Donald Trump‘s 2024 running mate, heartily attacked Vice President Kamala Harris in battleground Nevada on Tuesday. Vance has hit the campaign trail hard since being selected as Trump’s running mate during the Republican National Convention earlier in July, but his claims that “crazy cat ladies” in the Democratic Party are propping up Harris’s White House bid drew sharp condemnation last week. On Tuesday, at the first of two Nevada rallies, Vance instead opted to go after Harris’s “dangerously liberal” track record, including past statements from her short-lived 2020 presidential campaign, and instead contrast them with his humble upbringing in rural Ohio. “Kamala Harris has broken, I think, that foundational promise that if you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to live a good life in this country now. That’s why so many Americans no longer believe that their children will be better off than they are, and I hate to say it, if we elect Kamala Harris, they’re going to be right,” he declared Tuesday. Vance specifically recounted his childhood and being raised by his grandmother Bonnie Blanton Vance, whom he affectionately referred to as “Mamaw.” “I grew up in a family where things were often tight and tough, but I made it because, first of all, this is a great country that provides opportunities to its citizens, and we are grateful for it. Now, I also made it, of course, because I was raised by a tough old bird I called Mamaw,” he continued. “I’m so grateful for all the strong women out there, especially the strong grandmas and the strong moms.” Vance got off to a rocky start as Trump’s top surrogate, but reports and Republican insiders indicate there are no plans for the Republican vice presidential nominee to pull any punches.

Before Harris took the stage, Grammy-winning rapper Megan Thee Stallion, wearing a royal blue pantsuit, performed a handful of her hits, including \"Savage\" and \"Mamushi.\" Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock, Mayor Andre Dickens, Rep. Nikema Williams and former gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams also joined Harris at the event. Harris' campaign sees a win in Georgia, a battleground state, as one of her pathways to winning the 2024 election. Mr. Biden very narrowly won the state against former President Donald Trump four years ago — a rare victory in a state that hadn't backed a Democrat for president in nearly three decades. It was Mr. Biden's disastrous debate performance in Atlanta against Trump in June that ultimately led to the end of his reelection campaign.Harris is expected to pick her running mate by Monday, and a top tier of candidates has emerged, CBS News has learned. Harris said earlier Tuesday she has \"not yet\" made a decision about her running mate. Harris and the yet-to-be-named vice presidential candidate will campaign together in battleground states next week, sources familiar with the plans told CBS News. Trump and his running mate, Sen.

The visit will likely provide a backdrop for Vance to attack presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris on border security and immigration. Vance's multi-day tour of the southern border will begin on Thursday in Cochise County, Arizona, according to the Trump campaign. “President Donald J. Trump and Vice Presidential Nominee, Senator JD Vance are devastated to see the path of death and destruction American families are facing because of the radical-Left policies of the current administration,” the campaign said in a press release. “A Trump-Vance Administration will secure our border, begin the largest deportation operation in American history, and restore law and order to our country.” Since Vice President Harris announced her run for the presidency following Joe Biden's decision to step away from the race, Trump's campaign has focused their attacks against her on immigration and border issues. On Tuesday, the campaign released its first attack ad against Harris, which focused on her border security role in the Biden administration. The ad comes a week after House Republicans approved a resolution meant to condemn Harris's actions in that role, according to The Hill. Harris's campaign responded by pointing out that it was Trump who lobbied against a bipartisan, congressional border security bill earlier this year. Republicans — including and especially Trump — have described Harris as Biden's \"border czar,\" but she never held any such title. She was tasked with duties concerning the border — like leading diplomatic efforts to cut down on poverty, violence, and corruption in Central American countries including Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador, as well as in Mexico, according to former special representative for border affairs Alan Bersin, who spoke to Reuters. Regardless, Trump doubled down on the framing during a rally in North Carolina last week. \"If border czar Harris stays in charge, every week will bring a never-ending stream of illegal alien rapists, bloodthirsty killers and child predators to go after our sons and our daughters,\" he claimed. Despite Trump and the Republican's insistence otherwise, Harris was never tasked with the explicit job of securing the southern border. Still, her campaign has insisted she is the only candidate who will look for \"real solutions\" to border security issues. \"There's only one candidate in this race who will fight for real solutions to help secure our nation's border, and that's Vice President Harris,\" Kevin Munoz, Harris's campaign spokesperson, told Reuters. Vance recently admitted that Republicans are struggling to drum up attacks against Harris because she has less “baggage” than Biden. He made the remarks during a donor fundraiser in Golden Valley, Minnesota on Saturday, and a recording, obtained by The Washington Post, revealed his unfiltered thoughts about Harris’s entry into the campaign. “All of us were hit with a little bit of a political sucker punch,” Vance said. “The bad news is that Kamala Harris does not have the same baggage as Joe Biden, because whatever we might say, Kamala Harris is a lot younger. And Kamala Harris is obviously not struggling in the same ways that Joe Biden did.”","summary":"Republican VP candidate is expected to attack presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris over border security issues during tour","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/jd-vance-trump-border-immigration-b2588507.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/26/17/2163087347.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wWVtQIBs-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-30 22:00:48","author":"Graig Graziosi","authors":["Graig Graziosi"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.229},{"id":253005720,"title":"Commentary: Elon Musk is playing a dangerous game with Kamala Harris deepfake","text":"LITTLE PUSHBACK AGAINST AI FAKES For the Musk faithful, all this juvenile irreverence is what makes him so compelling. But we’re likely to see a closely fought US election this November, and the stakes are too high for recklessly posting half-truths. Experts in online misinformation tell me that, anecdotally, Harris has already become a greater target of deepfakes than Trump. With close to 200 million followers and the ability to tweak X’s recommendations or boot people off the platform, Musk can do more than just boost shares of Tesla or cause humiliation: He can influence thousands of voters in swing states. And if Elon can break the rules on posting AI-generated voices, there’s a good chance that others will do the same. Musk hasn’t only shown how much traction well-designed AI fakery can get on his site but how little pushback it can get too. Audio deepfakes can be insidious. They are increasingly difficult to distinguish from real voices, hence why they have quickly become a favoured tool for scammers. One in 10 people has reported being targeted by an AI voice cloning scam, while 77 per cent of these targets lost money to the fraud, according to a 2023 survey by cybersecurity firm McAfee. Another study found that humans in a lab setting could detect AI-generated speech about 70 per cent of the time, suggesting that in the wild, voice clones are getting harder to discern as they become more sophisticated.","summary":"Posting a manipulated recording of the US presidential candidate’s voice is no joke.

Tim Walz's top competitors for vice president?","text":"There's little doubt at this point that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is in the mix as Vice President Kamala Harris gets ready to select a running mate. The Harris campaign hasn't confirmed anything publicly, but national media reports are consistently putting Walz in a select group of serious prospects under consideration. He's been acting ready for his closeup, managing to generate some viral fame with recent interview quips that former President Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, are \"weird\" — a message that Democrats across the board quickly ran with. While certainly a well-known political quantity on the home front — Walz quickly picked up support from a roster of prominent Minnesota Democrats — the governor's sudden ascent took non-Minnesotans on social media by surprise. \"Where has this guy been\" has been a frequent question in recent days. Despite the buzz, Walz faces stiff competition for the VP nod. One possible consideration: As the governor of a state that hasn't gone Republican for president since 1972, Walz isn't ideally positioned to deliver a key state for Harris. From a former astronaut to the solidly popular governors of a swing state and a red state, here are the other likeliest contenders, based on reporting in the national political media. Sen. Mark Kelly, Arizona A former astronaut, Kelly won a special election in 2020 to finish the late Sen. John McCain's Senate term. He won a full term in 2022. Kelly is seen as a moderate voice in the Senate, where he represents a state that long leaned toward Republicans but has gained a purplish hue in recent years. But his departure from the Senate could also imperil Democrats' ultra-thin majority in that chamber. Gov. Andy Beshear, Kentucky Beshear won a close race to oust Republican Gov. Matt Bevin in 2019. He sailed to re-election in 2023, beating his challenger by nearly 5 percentage points to take a second term, in a state that usually goes strongly for Republicans on the statewide level. With Harris poised to make abortion access an important part of her campaign message, some Democrats are wondering whether Beshear would be best positioned to amplify that. Gov. Josh Shapiro, Pennsylvania Shapiro was elected to lead the crucial swing state in 2022, beating his Republican opponent by more than 14 percentage points. He won the endorsement of several former GOP officials, including two former congressmen and a former state House speaker. Trump won Pennsylvania in 2016, after the state gave Democrats its 19 electoral votes in six consecutive elections. Politico is reporting that Shapiro's position on natural gas extraction, which helped him secure vital labor backing in Pennsylvania, could also help explain Harris' recent shift on the issue. Pete Buttigieg, transportation secretary \"Mayor Pete\" has come a long way from the 2020 Democratic primaries. President Joe Biden tapped Buttigieg to be his transportation secretary and a go-to spokesman for the administration's policies. He has traveled the country touting the massive infrastructure bill that Congress passed in 2023. Buttigieg, 42, could also position himself as a rival to Vance, 39. But the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., lacks the statewide political success of his major rivals.","summary":"Besides Minnesota's governor, Vice President Kamala Harris is said to be considering Mark Kelly, Josh Shapiro and Andy Beshear, among others, as her running mate.","url":"https://www.startribune.com/who-are-minnesota-gov-tim-walz-s-top-competitors-for-vice-president/600387771/","image":"https://arc.stimg.co/startribunemedia/BU7S3EHRQBHRNNAZUIU3D5NCH4.jpg?h=630&w=1200&fit=crop&bg=999&crop=faces","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 21:57:57","author":"Eder Campuzano,Star Tribune","authors":["Eder Campuzano","Star Tribune"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.162},{"id":253005310,"title":"Israel says it killed Hezbollah commander in Beirut strike","text":"Israel conducted an airstrike Tuesday, targeting what it said was the senior Hezbollah commander responsible for a rocket attack over the weekend that killed a dozen Syrian children and young adults in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. Lebanon has held its collective breath for days, with speculation rampant over what Israel's response would be following a missile strike on Saturday that hit a football field in Majdal Shams, a Syrian town in the Golan Heights. Israel blamed Hezbollah for the attack, a charge the Iran-backed faction denied. A day later, Israel's air force said it hit seven Hezbollah targets deep in Lebanon. The airstrikes Tuesday evening appeared to be more limited, hitting a residential building near a hospital in the Hezbollah-dominated suburb of Beirut known as the Dahieh. Residents near the site of the blast said they heard a trio of explosions. The state-run National News Agency said it was the work of a drone firing three missiles. Lebanon's public health ministry said one woman was killed along with two children. An additional 74 people were wounded — three of them critically, the ministry said. \"It shook the ground. It felt really close,\" said one gas station attendant who asked not to be named. A 27-year-old architect who gave his name as Jawad said he had been in the street when the attack happened. \"The first missile landed, and barely a second passed before another came,\" he said. The missiles targeted near the top corner of an eight-story building, leaving at least one apartment a jagged, debris-filled maw and damaging a number of others. Jawad pointed to sprinklings of glass on the street. \"All this is from the top floors of the buildings around us,\" he said. The Israeli military claimed responsibility for the attack, saying it had “carried out a targeted strike in Beirut, on the commander responsible for the murder of the children in Majdal Shams and the killing of numerous additional Israeli civilians.” A later statement identified him as Fuad Shukr, also known as Hajj Mohsin, describing him as the \"right-hand man\" to Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and a senior member of the group's jihad council. The U.S. had put a $5-million bounty on Shukr's head for \"play[ing] a central role\" in the 1983 Marine barracks bombing in Beirut. \"Hezbollah crossed the red line,\" wrote Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. The Lebanese Foreign Ministry condemned the attack, saying in a statement to the Reuters news agency, \"We will file a complaint to the United Nations.\" Pro-Hezbollah officials, speaking on local media channels, said the operation had failed to kill its intended target. Though Hezbollah and Israel are longtime enemies, in recent years the fighting between the two had been limited to little more than the occasional exchange of missives. But tensions escalated after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack against Israel, and Israel's subsequent military offensive in Gaza. Hezbollah escalated a rocket campaign along the Israel-Lebanon border in solidarity with Hamas militants. Since then, the tense quiet that once reigned on the border has been replaced by an almost daily exchange of fire. Both sides insist they do not want an all-out war, but say they are prepared for it. The U.S. is intensifying diplomatic efforts to ensure the hostilities don't devolve into a full-on war. \"I unequivocally support Israel's right to defend itself against terrorism — and that is precisely what Hezbollah is doing,\" said U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris in a news conference after the strike. \"However, we must work toward a diplomatic solution to end the attacks.\"","summary":"Israel launched an airstrike targeting a senior Hezbollah commander it said was responsible for a rocket attack over the weekend.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2024-07-30/israel-says-it-killed-hezbollah-commander-in-beirut-strike","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/021da4c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8640x4536+0+612/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ffb%2F06%2F95e4ccfc4c489fee318741396bea%2Fap24212668667926.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-30 21:57:45","author":"Nabih Bulos","authors":["Nabih Bulos"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.169}]}
