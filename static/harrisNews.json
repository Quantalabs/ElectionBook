'60 Minutes' correspondent is alleging political interference in her story on CECOT","text":"CBS News is in the midst of a major controversy, as \"60 Minutes\" reporter Sharyn Alfonsi has sharply criticized editor-in-chief Bari Weiss' decision to delay her segment from airing about the notorious El Salvador prison CECOT. Alfonsi, a longtime correspondent for the newsmagazine, finds herself as part of the story after she sent a note to colleagues fuming over the decision by Weiss to hold the story, \"Inside CECOT,\" claiming it was done for political rather than editorial reasons. The Trump administration didn't grand CBS an interview for the segment. The fight has leaked into the public, causing a media frenzy and creating yet another headache at the Tiffany Network. Who is Sharyn Alfonsi? Alfonsi is a \"60 Minutes\" investigative correspondent. According to her online biography, she first appeared on the program in 2015, and has won several awards, including two Emmys for her reporting about survivors of the Parkland school shooting in 2018. '60 MINUTES' REPORTER LASHES OUT AT BARI WEISS AFTER SEGMENT ON EL SALVADOR PRISON YANKED AT LAST MINUTE She joined CBS again after a stint at ABC News. She worked previously as a CBS correspondent in New York and other CBS-owned local outlets before going to ABC. She's done a range of profiles for \"60 Minutes\" and investigative segments, including into the death of Jeffrey Epstein, and has reported from war zones, including coverage of the Biden administration's chaotic 2021 Afghanistan troop withdrawal. Her most recent story delved into the dangers of AI bots that chat with minors. What is her CECOT story about? Alfonsi's segment \"Inside CECOT\" was going to feature her interviewing some released deportees from the notorious prison, \"who describe the brutal and torturous conditions\" there. TRUMP OPEN TO SENDING VIOLENT AMERICAN CRIMINALS TO EL SALVADOR PRISONS \"Earlier this year, the Trump administration deported hundreds of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador, a country most had no ties to, claiming they were terrorists. This move sparked an ongoing legal battle, and nine months later the U.S. government still has not released the names of all those deported and placed in CECOT, one of El Salvador’s harshest prisons,\" the press release for the segment read. Has Alfonsi had any controversial reporting before this? Alfonsi came under fire in 2021 for a \"60 Minutes\" segment where she challenged Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and painted a narrative that he had given supermarket chain Publix preferential treatment on distributing COVID vaccines because its PAC had donated $100,000 to his campaign. However, the story came under significant criticism, including from Democrats like Florida Division of Emergency Management Director Jared Moskowitz. Publix had more than 800 locations in the state, making it an ideal location for distributing the vaccines to a state with a high senior population. Also, Publix fired back against the notion that it essentially bribed DeSantis, calling the suggestion \"false and offensive.\" CBS, BARI WEISS FACING MOUNTING BACKLASH FROM LIBERAL CRITICS OVER YANKING '60 MINUTES' SEGMENT CBS stood by the story at the time, even though the \"pay-for-play\" narrative was debunked. In addition, DeSantis accused CBS of cheaply editing a back-and-forth that aired between him and Alfonsi that omitted context about the story. What did she write about her story and Bari Weiss? In a memo that quickly leaked to the media Sunday night, Alfonsi told her colleagues that Weiss had spiked the story and not given her an opportunity to discuss it further. \"Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,\" Alfonsi wrote. \"It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.\" She added that \"60 Minutes\" made requests for comment to the White House, Department of Homeland Security, and the State Department. Their silence was their statement, she wrote, and allowing that to delay the story was effectively giving them veto power. \"If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,\" she wrote. Abandoning the sources who spoke with them at personal risk, Alfonsi said, would be wrong. KRISTI NOEM BLASTS 'FAKE NEWS' COVERAGE OF DEPORTED SALVADORAN NATIONAL, SAYS SCOTUS SENT 'CLEAR MESSAGE' \"We have been promoting this story on social media for days,\" Alfonsi wrote. \"Our viewers are expecting it. When it fails to air without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship. We are trading 50 years of ‘gold standard’ reputation for a single week of political quiet.\" In her memo, she also invoked the infamous Jeffrey Wigand saga, when \"60 Minutes\" was pressured by corporate executives not to air an interview with the tobacco industry whistleblower for fear of litigation. The scandal was a black eye for the network and was the subject of the 1999 movie \"The Insider.\" What did Bari Weiss say about the story? Weiss has defended the decision to hold the segment, saying it was not ready for air and didn't advance the story in a meaningful fashion. \"My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be,\" she said in a statement on Sunday. \"Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.\" On Monday, she told staffers on a morning editorial call, \"The only newsroom I’m interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect, and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues. Anything else is absolutely unacceptable.\" \"I held a ‘60 Minutes’ story because it was not ready. While the story presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT, it did not advance the ball — the [New York] Times and other outlets have previously done similar work. The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment at this prison. To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more. And this is ‘60 Minutes.’ We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera. Our viewers come first. Not the listing schedule or anything else. That’s my north star and I hope it’s yours, too.\" ANTI-ISRAEL CRITICS FUME AS TONY DOKOUPIL TAPPED TO ANCHOR 'CBS EVENING NEWS' According to reports, Weiss viewed the story on Thursday and ultimately decided it wasn't ready to go to air, citing that there wasn't an on-the-record Trump administration response. Executive producer Tanya Simon, according to the Washington Post, said during a private meeting that she stood by the story but wasn't able to assuage Weiss. \"In the end, our editor in chief had a different vision for how the piece should be, and it came late in the process, and we were not in a position to address the notes,\" said EP Tanya Simon, according to a partial transcript of the meeting obtained by the Post. \"We pushed back, we defended our story, but she wanted changes, and I ultimately had to comply.\" Weiss is already a lightning rod given her opinion background and pushback against \"woke\" ideology, and some of her moves and rhetoric during her brief tenure atop CBS News have irked media liberals. What other controversies has \"60 Minutes\" been embroiled in lately? The show is still smarting from President Donald Trump's lawsuit against the network over how it edited an interview with 2024 opponent Kamala Harris. Trump accused the network of election interference for how it aired portions of Harris' answer about Israel on two separate nights leading up to the election. Trump sued parent company Paramount and CBS for an eye-popping $20 billion. In the background, Paramount was seeking Trump adminisration approval for its merger with Skydance Media. Ultimately, Trump received a $16 million settlement that covered legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable cause. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The saga left \"60 Minutes\" staffers fuming that their corporate parent had paid, as late-night host Stephen Colbert put it, a \"big fat bribe\" to get the merger through, despite the network's lawyers saying the suit was meritless. Fox News Digital reached out to CBS and Alfonsi for comment.","summary":"CBS correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi was harshly critical of boss Bari Weiss for delaying her segment about a El Salvador prison where the Trump administration has sent illegal migrants.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/who-sharyn-alfonsi-60-minutes-correspondent-alleging-political-interference-her-story","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/12/sharyn-alfonsi.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-23 00:02:03","author":"David Rutz","authors":["David Rutz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":388215364,"title":"CBS News Chief Defends Controversial Decision To Pull ‘60 Minutes’ Episode","text":"CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss has reportedly defended her last-minute decision to hold a “60 Minutes” episode about a notorious prison in El Salvador by claiming that it wasn’t “ready.”\n\n“60 Minutes” announced the odd and abrupt move with an editor’s note hours before the scheduled premiere, almost immediately making headlines at major news publications. Weiss reportedly decided to hold the episode for an unspecified future broadcast after claiming there wasn’t enough included from the Trump administration.\n\n“I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready,” Weiss said in a statement, according to CNN.\n\nHowever, Sharyn Alfonsi, the 60 Minutes correspondent who reported the piece, slammed Weiss’ decision to pull the segment, especially since it was cleared by CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. \n\n“It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,” Alfonsi said in an internal email, according to multiple news outlets. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.” \n\nIn a Sunday memo obtained by Axios, Weiss said that the piece does not “present the administration’s argument for why it sent 252 Venezuelans to CECOT.”\n\n“What we have is Karoline Leavitt’s soundbite claiming they are evildoers in America (rapists, murderers, etc.). But isn’t there much more to ask in light of the torture that we are revealing? Tom Homan and Stephen Miller don’t tend to be shy. I realize we’ve emailed the DHS spox, but we need to push much harder to get these principals on the record,” she continued in the memo.\n\nIn an internal call on Monday, Weiss further defended her stance.\n\n“The story presented very powerful testimony of abuse at [the Salvadoran prison] CECOT, but that testimony has already been reported on by places like The [New York] Times,” Weiss said on the call, according to New York Times media reporter Ben Mullin. “The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment in this prison. So to run a story on this subject, two months later, we simply need to do more.”\n\nIn a statement to The New York Times Sunday evening, Weiss also argued that holding stories is necessary and normal.\n\n“My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be,” Weiss said. “Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”\n\nThe issue has caused a ruckus inside CBS News, with one source at the network telling CNN that staff members are threatening to quit.\n\nThe Washington Post reported that an executive producer of the show also spoke about Weiss’ decision in a private internal meeting.\n\n“In the end, our editor in chief had a different vision for how the piece should be, and it came late in the process, and we were not in a position to address the notes,” executive producer Tanya Simon said. “We pushed back, we defended our story, but she wanted changes, and I ultimately had to comply.”\n\nMoreover, one unnamed insider told The Wrap that other management at CBS was also concerned with the story, but the insider argued that Weiss could have sprung into action if she wanted.\n\n“It was approved, but there were second thoughts, and they didn’t act,” the insider told The Wrap, arguing that Weiss could have used her connections at the White House to get an interview.\n\n“You can have second thoughts, but why not use your best weapon to get something?” the insider added.\n\nCBS News brought on Weiss — a critic of DEI, the Me Too movement and so-called “cancel culture” — as editor-in-chief in October, solidifying the network’s rightward shift. \n\nShe has also attempted to downplay famine in Gaza with The Free Press, her publication that Paramount has now acquired.\n\nA source told CNN that “Bari Weiss got personally involved” with stories, specifically those involving politics, after Trump publicly criticized a “60 Minutes” interview with Marjorie Taylor Greene, his friend-turned-foe.\n\nNotably, Weiss’ decision also comes after Paramount settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump, agreeing to pay him $16 million over a 2024 “60 Minutes” episode with former Vice President Kamala Harris, his opponent in the most recent presidential election. \n\nThe settlement was denounced by First Amendment advocates who argued it could set a harmful precedent.","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/cbs-news-bari-weiss-defends-decision-pull-60-minutes-episode_n_694991ffe4b0c3ddb2232a9f?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6949a79d19000027137f4e9f.jpeg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 23:06:56","author":"Taiyler S.

Kimmel was quickly reinstated, however, following backlash across the political spectrum.\n\nCBS, which was purchased by the Trump-linked Ellison family earlier this year, said that the prison report needed “additional reporting.”\n\nMultiple US media outlets quoted the “60 Minutes” correspondent who oversaw the report as saying it had been pulled for political reasons.\n\n“Pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,” Sharyn Alfonsi said in a note to CBS staff first leaked by The Wall Street Journal.\n\nCECOT is a huge, maximum security facility touted by El Salvador’s right-wing President Nayib Bukele as the centrepiece of his attempt to rid the Central American country of narco-gangs.\n\nHuman rights activists say inmates there are treated brutally.\n\nThe facility has been at the centre of major US legal case since March, when the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan and other migrants there despite a judge’s order that they be returned to the United States.\n\nSeveral deportees who have since been released have described repeated abuse at the facility.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCBS owners close to Trump\n\nCBS’s decision to shelve a high-profile story on the Trump administration comes as the broadcaster’s parent company, Paramount Skydance, is in a multi-billion-dollar bidding war with Netflix to buy Warner Bros Discovery.\n\nTrump has made clear he is taking a keen interest in the merger, which will likely need regulatory approval.\n\nParamount was purchased by the Ellison family, which is close to Trump, earlier this year. Larry Ellison is one of the world’s richest people, via his tech company Oracle, and a major Trump donor.\n\nThe Republican president has frequently criticized “60 Minutes” and sued CBS in 2024 over his claim that the news program had edited an interview with Democrat Kamala Harris in order to help her.\n\nParamount chief David Ellison – son of Larry Ellison – brought in Bari Weiss as a new editor in chief this October, leading to expectations that she would steer the renowned broadcaster to be more friendly to Trump.\n\nIn her note to colleagues, Alfonsi said the CECOT segment had been cleared by corporate lawyers before being “spiked.”\n\n“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”\n\nWeiss told The New York Times in a statement that she would be “airing this important piece when it’s ready.”\n\n“Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom.”\n\nThe executive producer of “60 Minutes,” Tanya Simon, told fellow employees that she had resisted Weiss’s order, but “ultimately had to comply.”\n\n“We pushed back, we defended our story, but she wanted changes,” Simon was quoted as saying by The Washington Post in a transcript of the producer’s private meeting with colleagues.\n\n– © AFP2025\n\nView 19 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Outcry after US broadcaster pulls programme on alleged abuses at Trump deportation prison”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Outcry after US broadcaster pulls programme on alleged abuses at Trump deportation prison”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.

Jerry Nadler.\n\nConway was previously a conservative whose ex-wife, Kellyanne, served as a senior aide to Trump during his first term.\n\n“George is a seasoned fighter against Trump and Trumpism, and he’s considering taking that fight to Congress,” a source close to Conway told NBC News. “Today, he filed paperwork that is a prerequisite to run. He will have more to say in the new year after the holidays.”\n\nConway, 62, hinted at his congressional bid during a recent episode of his podcast on The Bulwark, where he announced his departure from the show to undertake the next chapter of his career.\n\nHe said it will be “either the stupidest thing I’ve ever done, or the best thing. We’ll see.”\n\nHe joins about a dozen other candidates competing to represent the district, which covers a large section of Manhattan. Among those running are Jack Schlossberg, the grandson of former President John F. Kennedy, gun safety activist Cameron Kasky, and state Assemblyman Micah Lasher.\n\nThe Democratic primary will be held in June, followed by the general election in November.\n\nConway’s choice to run as a Democrat highlights his shift away from the Republican Party in recent years.\n\nThe Yale Law School graduate began his career by working on prominent conservative cases, including by representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against President Bill Clinton, which garnered significant media attention.\n\nConway was offered a role in Trump’s first administration, though he declined to accept it, according to Politico. His ex-wife, Kellyanne Conway, managed Trump’s 2016 campaign and she later served as a White House counselor. \n\nShortly after Trump entered office, Conway’s relationship with the president soured, and the pair frequently exchanged barbs on social media.\n\nTrump described Conway as a \"whack job\" and a \"husband from hell,” prompting Conway to call the president “nuts.”\n\nSince then, Conway has consistently criticized Trump on X, where he has amassed more than 2 million followers, and he regularly appears on cable news to bash the president.\n\nIn 2019, Conway co-founded The Lincoln Project, a political action committee committed to supporting Republicans who opposed Trump’s re-election. He ultimately backed former President Joe Biden in 2020 and former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nConway and his wife divorced in 2023, ending their 22-year marriage.\n\nIn November, The New York Times reported that Conway, who currently lives in Maryland, was looking for an apartment in New York’s 12th congressional district.","summary":"The former conservative – whose ex-wife was a top aide to Trump in his first term – joins about a dozen other candidates competing to represent the district, which covers a large section of Manhattan","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/george-conway-congress-new-york-jack-schlossberg-b2889177.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/08/22/13/49/US-POLITICS-BOLTON-RAID-liwoz5h3.jpeg?crop=7131,4754,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/coKLlYuz-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-22 20:52:46","author":"Brendan Rascius","authors":["Brendan Rascius"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.232},{"id":388193734,"title":"’60 Minutes’ pulls story about Trump deportations from its lineup","text":"“The only newsroom I’m interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues,” Weiss said. “Anything else is completely unacceptable.”\n\nShe said that while Alfonsi’s story presented powerful testimony about torture at the CECOT prison, The New York Times and other outlets had already done similar work. “To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more,” she said. “And this is ’60 Minutes.’ We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera.”\n\nIt wasn’t clear whether Weiss’ involvement in seeking administration comment was sought. She reportedly helped the newscast arrange interviews with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff this past fall to discuss Trump’s Middle East peace efforts. Trump himself was interviewed by Norah O’Donnell on a “60 Minutes” telecast that aired on Nov. 2.\n\nTrump has been sharply critical of “60 Minutes.” He refused to grant the show an interview prior to last fall’s election, then sued the network over how it handled an interview with election opponent Kamala Harris. CBS’ parent Paramount Global agreed to settle the lawsuit by paying Trump $16 million this past summer. More recently, Trump angrily reacted to correspondent Lesley Stahl’s interview with Trump former ally turned critic Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n“60 Minutes” was notably tough on Trump during the first months of his second term, particularly in stories done by correspondent Scott Pelley. In accepting an award from USC Annenberg earlier this month for his journalism, Pelley noted that the stories were aired last spring “with an absolute minimum of interference.”","url":"https://news.net/news/60-minutes-pulls-story-about-trump-deportations-from-its-lineup/","image":"https://dymlcaxjpm5z9.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/12101037/YE_US_Immigration_2025_Photo_Gallery_52647-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 19:43:36","author":"David Bauder","authors":["David Bauder"],"language":"en","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.326},{"id":388179326,"title":"Trump Foe Takes on Kennedy Nepo Baby With Congressional Run","text":"Trump foe George Conway filed to run for Congress in New York Monday as a Democrat in a primary field that is growing increasingly crowded. \n\nConway, a former conservative lawyer turned Trump critic, will run for the seat currently being vacated by longtime Democratic Rep.

A struggle with black voters. \n\nHarris, who famously lost the popular vote and Electoral College to Trump in the 2024 election, has the support of 30 percent of her party's voters to try again, according to a new Daily Mail/JL Partners poll.\n\nNewsom has 21 percent support.\n\nIf only white voters were considered, the two frontrunners would be tied at 25 percent each.\n\nBut it's black voters that are powering Harris's resilience.\n\nAmong just black Democratic voters, the former vice president, who is black and Indian, holds 39 percent support to Newsom's 10 percent with the same demographic. \n\nHarris and Newsom are by far the only ones who received a considerable amount of the preference for 2028 among Democrats.\n\nA distant third place is former Transportation Department Secretary Pete Buttigieg with 7 percent and tied for fourth place with 4 percent each are Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Arizona Senator Mark Kelly.\n\nAll other prospective Democratic candidates for the next presidential election are at 3 percent or less in the Daily Mail poll conducted December 17-19 of 383 likely Democrat primary voters.\n\nThis includes Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Harris's former running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz and Illinois Governor JB Pritzker.\n\nHarris's team didn't respond to a Daily Mail request for comment on whether she is weighing a bid and if her favorable standing has her leaning toward another shot at the White House.\n\nAnd Newsom's office was asked for comment regarding his struggle with black voters and whether he's testing the waters of a presidential bid. The Daily Mail has not yet received a response.\n\nVance, who is largely seen as the frontrunner for Republicans in 2028, predicted during remarks at Turning Point's AmericaFest in Phoenix, Arizona, that Democrats would put forward a liberal from California in the next presidential election.\n\nThe Vice President said on Sunday: 'Now the Democrats are already talking about 2028 and it looks like they're going to nominate a California liberal who's presided over rolling blackouts, open borders, and unchecked violent gangs. They're just trying to settle on whether it's going to be Gavin Newsom or Kamala Harris.'\n\nAn Atlas Intel poll on the 2028 primaries released this month shows Newsom as the clear frontrunner with 35 percent support among 670 Democratic voters. \n\nIn that polling, Harris doesn't even make the top three.\n\nOcasio-Cortez comes in second with 16 percent, Buttigieg in third with 15 percent and the former VP in fourth with 8 percent.\n\nAttracting black likely voters is what gives Harris an edge in the Daily Mail polling.\n\nButtigieg also struggled among black voters, with a measly 2 percent of Democrat poll respondents compared to 9 percent of white voters.\n\nIn the 2020 presidential primary, Buttigieg struggled with religious black voters, reportedly because of their skepticism towards voting for a gay man as president. It's what sunk his chances in the early primary state of South Carolina, where the majority of Democratic voters are black.\n\nWith only black Democratic voters, first place still goes to Harris and second place to Newsom – but now the lower end of the field gets reorganized.\n\nShapiro and Pritzker are in third with 4 percent, along with Democratic Senator Cory Booker, who gets a boost when only black voters are considered.\n\nNewsom and Harris are tied among white voters and Buttigieg still comes right behind the two frontrunners.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris remains at the top of the Democratic field for the 2028 race to the White House, but a fellow Californian is nipping at her heels. ","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15405971/Gavin-Newsom-black-voters-White-House-Kamala-Harris.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/22/15/104946199-0-image-m-6_1766416585259.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/10/28/67659889853547723/1024x576_MP4_67659889853547723.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-22 18:04:17","author":"Editor,Katelyn Caralle","authors":["Editor","Katelyn Caralle"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":388187868,"title":"'60 Minutes' pulls story about Trump deportations from its lineup (World)","text":"60 Minutes' pulls story about Trump deportations from its lineup\n\nCBS pulls Trump story\n\nAn internal CBS News battle over a “60 Minutes” story critical of the Trump administration has exploded publicly, with a correspondent charging it was kept off the air for political reasons and news chief Bari Weiss saying Monday the story did not “advance the ball.”\n\nTwo hours before airtime Sunday, CBS announced that the story where correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi spoke to deportees who had been sent to El Salvador's notorious CECOT prison, would not be a part of the show. Weiss, the Free Press founder named CBS News editor-in-chief in October, said it was her decision.\n\nThe dispute puts one of journalism's most respected brands — and a frequent target of President Donald Trump — back in the spotlight and amplifies questions about whether Weiss' appointment was a signal that CBS News was headed in a more Trump-friendly direction.\n\nAlfonsi, in an email sent to fellow “60 Minutes” correspondents said the story was factually correct and had been cleared by CBS lawyers and its standards division. But the Trump administration had refused to comment for the story, and Weiss wanted a greater effort made to get their point of view.\n\n“In my view, pulling it now after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,” Alfonsi wrote in the email. She did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nAlfonsi said in the email that interviews were sought with or questions directed to — sometimes both — the White House, State Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,” Alfonsi wrote. “Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story. If the administration's refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”\n\n“Spike” is a journalist's term for killing a story. But Weiss, in a statement, said that she looked forward to airing Alfonsi's piece “when it's ready.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at the daily CBS News internal editorial call, Weiss was clearly angered by Alfonsi's memo. A transcript of Weiss' message was provided by CBS News.\n\n“The only newsroom I'm interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues,” Weiss said. “Anything else is completely unacceptable.”\n\nShe said that while Alfonsi's story presented powerful testimony about torture at the CECOT prison, The New York Times and other outlets had already done similar work. “To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more,” she said. “And this is ‘60 Minutes.’ We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera.”\n\nIt wasn't clear whether Weiss' involvement in seeking administration comment was sought. She reportedly helped the newscast arrange interviews with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff this past fall to discuss Trump's Middle East peace efforts. Trump himself was interviewed by Norah O’Donnell on a “60 Minutes” telecast that aired on Nov. 2.\n\nTrump has been sharply critical of “60 Minutes.” He refused to grant the show an interview prior to last fall’s election, then sued the network over how it handled an interview with election opponent Kamala Harris. CBS’ parent Paramount Global agreed to settle the lawsuit by paying Trump $16 million this past summer. More recently, Trump angrily reacted to correspondent Lesley Stahl’s interview with Trump former ally turned critic Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n“60 Minutes” was notably tough on Trump during the first months of his second term, particularly in stories done by correspondent Scott Pelley. In accepting an award from USC Annenberg earlier this month for his journalism, Pelley noted that the stories were aired last spring “with an absolute minimum of interference.”\n\nPelley said that people at “60 Minutes” were concerned about what new ownership installed at Paramount this summer would mean for the broadcast. “It’s early yet, but what I can tell you is we are doing the same kinds of stories with the same kind of rigor, and we have experienced no corporate interference of any kind,” Pelley said then, according to deadline.com.","summary":"An internal CBS News battle over a &ldquo;60 Minutes&rdquo; story critical of the Trump administration has exploded publicly, with a correspondent charging it was kept off the air for political reasons and news chief Bari Weiss saying Monday the story did not &ldquo;advance the ball.&rdquo;\n\nTwo h...","url":"https://www.castanet.net/news/World/590732/60-Minutes-pulls-story-about-Trump-deportations-from-its-lineup","image":"https://www.castanet.net/content/2025/12/2959ff7d15eb2d634ddcd93e57823a5c9824326a765c737b91d6b5ed7f8e27f8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 18:01:00","author":"David Bauder","authors":["David Bauder"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.345},{"id":388179288,"title":"Katie Miller Gives ‘60 Minutes’ a Bonkers Lecture After Pro-Trump Censorship","text":"Katie Miller is berating a reporter for one of the nation’s top investigative shows amid allegations of pro-Trump censorship at CBS.\n\nVeteran journalist Sharyn Alfonsi said MAGA-curious new CBS editor-in-chief axed Alfonsi’s segment on the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador just hours before it was due to air Sunday on 60 Minutes.\n\n“When you want to become the story, you’ve lost any shred of journalistic integrity,” Miller, 34, a former Trump official who is married to White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller and now hosts a weekly podcast about her conservative lifestyle, wrote on X late Sunday. \n\n“The Legacy Media loves talking about themselves and is openly hostile to anyone who dare question their utter righteousness,” she went on. “60 Minutes is a clear partisan program masquerading as impartial journalism.”\n\nWeiss chose to pull the segment after insisting it “needed additional reporting.” She proposed a sit-down with Stephen Miller, who’s credited as architect of the nationwide immigration crackdown that sent migrants to the megaprison in the first place.\n\nThe decision to appoint Weiss as editor-in-chief followed the Trump-approved purchase of CBS parent company Paramount by media conglomerate Skydance, which critics say has now effectively brought the network under the control of pro-Trump billionaire father and son duo Larry and David Ellison. \n\nMAGA heralded the deal as a significant victory for President Donald Trump, who earlier this year sued CBS over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris that he claimed had been deceptively edited to give the then-Democratic candidate an edge in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nCBS settled with Trump for $16 million in July ahead Paramount’s sale to Skydance.\n\n“How many lawyers cleared Kamala’s very edited interview?” Miller posted Sunday, responding to a quoted segment of Alfonsi’s letter in which the CBS journalist wrote that the CECOT segment had been rigorously fact-checked and approved by the network’s lawyers. \n\nWeiss has denied politics played any role in the decision to pull Sunday’s segment. “Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom,” she told The New York Times.","summary":"Kevin Dietsch / Getty ImagesKatie Miller is berating a reporter for one of the nation’s top investigative shows amid allegations of pro-Trump censorship at CBS.\n\nVeteran journalist Sharyn Alfonsi said MAGA-curious new CBS editor-in-chief axed Alfonsi’s segment on the CECOT megaprison in El Salvador just hours before it was due to air Sunday on 60 Minutes.\n\nIn a memo to other members of the team behind the network’s flagship investigative program, Alfonsi accused Weiss, 41, of pulling the story—otherwise billed as an inside look at “brutal and torturous conditions” at the facility, to which the Trump administration has deported hundreds of migrants this year—on political grounds.

But it was removed just hours before broadcast, with a CBS News spokesperson writing in an updated release that the story needed additional reporting and would air at a future date.\n\n The controversial decision sparked internal debate at CBS News, according to a private email that correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi sent to fellow 60 Minutes staffers on Sunday.\n\n In the note — first obtained by The Wall Street Journal and later by multiple outlets including NPR, The New York Times and independent journalist Yashar Ali — Alfonsi said she learned Saturday that CBS News' new editor-in-chief, Bari Weiss, had “spiked our story,” calling the decision “not an editorial decision\" but \"a political one.\"\n\n \"Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,\" Alfonsi wrote, according to the outlets. \"It is factually correct.\"\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. \n\n CBS announced the programming change on Sunday afternoon, roughly two to three hours before broadcast — an unusual move for the long-running newsmagazine, whose segments typically take weeks or months to produce, according to The New York Times and NPR.\n\n PEOPLE reached out to CBS News for comment. But in a statement issued Sunday night, Weiss characterized the decision as a routine newsroom judgment call.\n\n \"My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be,” Weiss said, in a statement quoted by The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times. \"Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason — that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices — happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.\"\n\n Weiss reportedly told colleagues over the weekend that the segment could not run without an on-the-record comment from a Trump administration official, according to NPR, which cited two people with knowledge of events at the network who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\n Alfonsi, however, wrote that her team had sought comment from the White House, the Department of Homeland Security and the State Department.\n\n \"Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,\" Alfonsi wrote in her internal email to colleagues. \"If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a 'kill switch' for any reporting they find inconvenient.\"\n\n The pulled segment centered on Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration earlier this year to El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, known as CECOT.\n\n In promotional materials released Friday, CBS News said Alfonsi had interviewed several men who had since been released and who described \"the brutal and torturous conditions they endured.\" Those promotions were later revised or taken down.\n\n According to The New York Times, Weiss first reviewed the segment Thursday and raised concerns over several days, requesting additional material. Among her suggestions, the outlet reported, was securing a new interview with Stephen Miller, a top White House aide and architect of the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, or another senior administration official.\n\n Weiss also questioned the use of the term “migrants” to describe the Venezuelan men, with NPR reporting that some of those deported had applied for asylum and were awaiting decisions on their cases.\n\n The controversy comes amid broader scrutiny of CBS News following changes under new ownership. Weiss was appointed editor-in-chief in October after Paramount Skydance acquired her news and opinion site, The Free Press, earlier this year. She remains editor of The Free Press while also overseeing CBS News.\n\n The network has also faced heightened political pressure in recent months. As a presidential candidate, Donald Trump sued CBS last year over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Paramount later paid $16 million to settle the lawsuit without an admission of wrongdoing.\n\n Trump has continued to criticize the program publicly, blasting CBS and its new ownership in recent social media posts, even as Paramount executives seek federal approval for additional media acquisitions.\nMost recently, the president, 79, blasted an episode that featured former ally-turned-critic Marjorie Taylor Greene. “THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME!” Trump wrote on Truth Social this month, adding, “Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!”\n\n In her email, Alfonsi warned that pulling the segment risked undermining 60 Minutes’ decades-long reputation.\n\n \"We have been promoting this story for days,\" she wrote in the email, shared by Ali. \"Our viewers are expecting it. When it fails to air without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship. We are trading 50 years of 'Gold Standard' reputation for a single week of political quiet.\"\n\n \"I care too much about this broadcast to watch it be dismantled without a fight,\" Alfonsi said, per Ali.\n\n Reached by The New York Times on Sunday evening, Alfonsi declined further comment, saying, \"I refer all questions to Bari Weiss.\"","summary":"The report, removed hours before broadcast, examined Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to an El Salvador megaprison","url":"https://people.com/60-minutes-segment-pulled-bari-weiss-correspondent-calls-decision-political-11874231","image":"https://people.com/thmb/fr0FTuVpc3Tt1H-OtYWsbAVazsU=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/bari-weiss-cbs-122225-8f2d625ba31846f2b240d1575d05f946.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 15:38:39","author":"Dave Quinn","authors":["Dave Quinn"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.017},{"id":388181306,"title":"’60 Minutes’ holds off on airing critical piece on Trump deportation policy","text":"CBS News’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday didn’t air a planned story on Trump administration deportations of immigrants to El Salvador, pulling it only hours before airtime at the direction of new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.\n\nThe story, where correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi spoke to deportees who had been sent to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison, was held because Weiss sought to add perspective from the Trump administration, according to people at the network.\n\nIn an email sent to some colleagues and reported by multiple media outlets, Alfonsi said she’d learned on Saturday that Weiss had decided not to air it.

Discovery – may just be a bridge too far for some folks at the Tiffany Network.\n\n“The ‘60 Minutes’ folks will likely revolt over this,” a network insider told The Independent. “Especially during football season.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to CBS News and 60 Minutes for comment\n\nThe investigative news program had promoted an upcoming piece entitled “Inside CECOT” about the notorious El Salvador prison to which President Donald Trump’s administration has been deporting undocumented migrants, with journalist Sharyn Alfonsi interviewing inmates about the abuse they say they had suffered within its walls.\n\nBut in a post on social media on Sunday afternoon, the network notified viewers: “The broadcast lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated. Our report ‘Inside CECOT’ will air in a future broadcast.”\n\nThe piece was replaced with an innocuous report on an English family of classical musicians and an extended story about the sherpas of Mount Everest. \n\nWhile other sources said the segment being pulled is “definitely fishy” and is essentially unprecedented, the CBS News staffer sounded off on the appearance of Weiss taking orders from either the White House or Ellison.\n\n“It’s going to be fascinating to see how far Bari is willing to double down on the piece ‘not ready’ argument and or/attack Sharyn and [60 Minutes],” they said. “”It’ll be our clearest signal yet that she doesn’t represent CBS News but instead David Ellison and whatever is convenient for him politically at any given moment.”\n\nThe staffer pointed out that Ellison “obviously wants Trump’s backing to wrestle WBD’s purchase from Netflix,” adding that “murdering 60 Minutes might be an acceptable price for him.”\n\nThe decision prompted Alfonsi to email a number of her colleagues, including anchors Lesley Stahl, Scott Pelley and Anderson Cooper, in which she wrote: “I learned on Saturday that Bari Weiss spiked our story, Inside CECOT, which was supposed to air tonight. We [producer Oriana Zill de Granados and herself] asked for a call to discuss her decision. She did not afford us that courtesy/opportunity.”\n\n“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” she added. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now – after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Weiss requested “numerous changes to the segment,” suggesting that it include a new interview with White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller and questioning its description of the deportees as “migrants” because they had first arrived in the U.S. illegally.\n\n“We requested responses to questions and/or interviews with DHS, the White House, and the State Department,” Alfonsi stated in her email to 60 Minutes staff. “Government silence is a statement, not a veto. Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story.”\n\n“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” she continued. \n\n“If the standard for airing a story becomes ‘the government must agree to be interviewed,’ then the government effectively gains control over the 60 Minutes broadcast,” Alfonsi noted. “We go from an investigative powerhouse to a stenographer for the state.”\n\nWeiss, in her own comment to the New York Times Sunday night about the nixed segment, said that her “ job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be.” She went on to state that “holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom,” and that she looks “forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”\n\nMeanwhile, a CBS News spokesperson said Sunday evening that the “60 Minutes report on ‘Inside CECOT’ will air in a future broadcast” and the network “determined it needed additional reporting.”\n\nAs Alfonsi noted in her blistering email, prior to Weiss suddenly pulling the segment, the network had “been promoting this story on social media for days” and “our viewers are expecting it.” She further warned that if the story “fails to air without a credible explanation, the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship.”\n\nThe staffer who spoke to The Independent also chimed in to wonder if “America will be OK with the killing of the most watched news program that has dominated” the country’s airwaves for the past 50 years. “I don’t think so,” the staffer concluded.\n\nDuring Monday’s broadcast of CBS Mornings, co-host Nate Burleson delivered a short report about the decision to yank the “Inside CECOT” story at the last minute, reading off portions of Alfonsi’s email as well as Weiss’ statement to the press and the official comment from a CBS News spokesperson. \n\nOn top of that, the Monday morning editorial call was expected to be tense, with staffers likely looking to press Weiss and CBS News President Tom Cibrowski for more answers about the decision.\n\n“Monday’s editorial meeting will be a doozy,” the reporter said.\n\nDuring the editorial call, meanwhile, a tired-looking Weiss appeared a bit incensed over the backlash to her pulling the CECOT story while doubling down on her decision.\n\n“The only newsroom that I'm interested in running is one where we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest and editorial matters, and do so with respect, and crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues and anything else is absolutely unacceptable to me and should be unacceptable to you,” she huffed.\n\n“Of course, you've all seen, I held a 60 Minutes story, and I held that story because it wasn't ready. While the story presented powerful testimony of torture at CECOT, it did not advance the ball – the Times and other outlets have previously done similar work,” Weiss continued. “The public knows that Venezuelans have been subjected to horrific treatment in this prison. So to run a story on this subject two months later, we simply need to do more, and this is 60 Minutes.”\n\nShe concluded: “We need to be able to make every effort to get the principals on the record and on camera. To me, our viewers come first, not a listing schedule or anything else. And that is my North Star, and I hope it's the North Star of every person in this newsroom.”\n\nThe staffer, for their part, pushed back on Weiss’ claim about demanding respectful conversations when it came to her editorial decisions, adding that her “angry tone” was not going over well in the newsroom.\n\n“What conversation? According to Sharyn’s email, Bari wouldn’t even get on the phone with them to explain why she spiked the piece,” the staffer added.\n\nSince purchasing Paramount in a politically fraught merger that saw the company’s prior leadership pay Trump $16 million to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, Ellison has seemingly pushed the news network in a rightward direction while courting favor from the White House.\n\nThis has seemingly included the installation of Weiss atop the news division as well as the purchase of her center-right “heterodox” media outlet The Free Press for $150 million. \n\nSince her arrival, the network has gone through brutal layoffs – which were already underway before she came on board – that largely impacted women and people of color, canceled a number of digital programs while overhauling the Saturday morning news show and promoted CBS Mornings host Tony Dokoupil to anchor the evening news – which came after Weiss was unable to land a high-profile external candidate to lead the show.\n\nWeiss, who has been heavily involved in booking guests and recruiting talent since arriving, recently took heat from staff for installing herself as the on-air moderator of a town hall special with Erika Kirk, the widow of slain right-wing activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk. \n\nThe Saturday night event, which was seen as a massive ratings flop, was the launching point for Weiss’ new series Things That Matter, which will feature Vice President JD Vance and other prominent politicians and business leaders. The series will also include debates between ideologically opposed subjects on polarizing political and social topics.\n\nWeiss also reports directly to Ellison and not CBS News president and executive editor Tom Cibrowski, not Paramount’s TV chief George Cheeks.\n\nAll the while, Ellison and his father – ultrawealthy Oracle founder and close Trump ally Larry Ellison – have been banking on the White House’s support as they attempt to circumvent Netflix’s accepted offer for Warner Bros. Discovery. At the same time, though, the president has used recent broadcasts of 60 Minutes to fume about Ellison’s leadership of the company.\n\n“For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called ‘takeover,’ than they have ever treated me before,” Trump recently groused on Truth Social. He’s also said that he doesn’t feel that the Ellisons are his “friends” anymore.\n\nOn Monday morning, it was reported that Larry Ellison upped the bid for WBD by agreeing to personally backstop the $40 billion of equity financing in Paramount’s hostile bid for the studio giant.","summary":"EXCLUSIVE: ‘It’s going to be fascinating to see how far Bari is willing to double down on the piece ‘not ready’ argument and or/attack Sharyn and [60 Minutes],’ one CBS News staffer told The Independent.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bari-weiss-60-minutes-cecot-b2889020.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/25/18/24/Screenshot-Capture-2025-11-25-12-40-30.png?crop=945,630,x43,y0&trim=0,43,0,42&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gj6N2FUY-LkahLqdO.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-22 15:30:12","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":388168834,"title":"The DNC’s 2024 Election Autopsy Was So Bad That It's Hiding It","text":"DNC Chairman Ken Martin has a problem, and it’s one his own party doesn’t want to talk about. Democratic insiders are reportedly furious that he has decided to keep the party’s internal 2024 election postmortem under wraps, never to see the light of day.\n\nYou would think that a party that insists on “transparency” from everyone else would welcome a little honesty about its own failures. Instead, Martin decided to bury it.\n\nAs is usually the case after an election loss, the Democratic National Committee spent months commissioning an exhaustive internal review of the 2024 cycle. As we know, Kamala Harris blew through more than $1 billion and lost every single swing state, helping Trump do something that a Republican hadn’t done since 2004: win the national popular vote.\n\nI think we all have an idea of what the election autopsy says, but voters, donors, or even most party staff won’t get to see it. According to multiple reports, Martin and his team have decided that the people footing the bill for the Democrats’ losing streak don’t need to know what went wrong, which suggests that what they found is even more damning than we can guess on our own.\n\nRecommended: The Minnesota Fraud Scandal Is So Much Worse When You Put It This Way\n\nPredictably, this decision isn’t going over well within the party. Strategists are warning that hiding the report only reinforces the growing trust gap between Democratic leadership and everyone else. One insider told The Hill the party has a habit of “glossing things over” and pretending there’s “nothing to see here.” That’s a nasty case of denial right there. It’s also a pretty good explanation for why Democrats keep losing elections they expect to win.\n\nAnother prominent Democrat, strategist Jamal Simmons, argued that volunteers, donors, and voters \"deserve to know what went wrong\" and that the DNC should tell them.That criticism goes to the heart of what conservatives have long argued, that the Democrat Party is increasingly run like a brand-management operation, quick to message and slow to confront reality.Democrats can tout midterm hopes all they want, but refusing transparency about a historic defeat looks like avoidance, not confidence.The New York Times, which first detailed the internal review, reported that the DNC conducted more than 300 interviews with Democrats in all 50 states.Martin, however, decided not to publish the findings and will keep them under seal, believing a public look back would be \"counterproductive\" as Democrats try to win seats in 2026.Martin summed up the rationale bluntly: If it doesn't help the party win, it's a \"distraction,\" according to the Times.\n\nYikes! It’s even worse than we thought.\n\nThe whole situation episode exposes a deeper problem with the Democratic Party, and not just their hypocrisy on transparency. I am sure the autopsy likely confirms what many long suspected: the party has drifted too far left for the electorate it seeks to lead, and the DNC would rather hide that reality than confront it. This, of course, is good news for Republicans because Democrats appear determined to keep making the same mistakes. And that’s one postmortem we don’t need a secret report to see coming.\n\nThis holiday season, support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories legacy media bury.

Weiss, the Free Press founder named CBS News editor-in-chief in October, said it was her decision.\n\nThe dispute puts one of journalism’s most respected brands — and a frequent target of President Donald Trump — back in the spotlight and amplifies questions about whether Weiss’ appointment was a signal that CBS News was headed in a more Trump-friendly direction.\n\nAlfonsi, in an email sent to fellow “60 Minutes” correspondents said the story was factually correct and had been cleared by CBS lawyers and its standards division. But the Trump administration had refused to comment for the story, and Weiss wanted a greater effort made to get their point of view.\n\n“In my view, pulling it now after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,” Alfonsi wrote in the email. She did not immediately respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.\n\nAlfonsi said in the email that interviews were sought with or questions directed to — sometimes both — the White House, State Department and Department of Homeland Security.\n\n“Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,” Alfonsi wrote. “Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story. If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”\n\n“Spike” is a journalist’s term for killing a story. But Weiss, in a statement, said that she looked forward to airing Alfonsi’s piece “when it’s ready.”\n\nSpeaking Monday at the daily CBS News internal editorial call, Weiss was clearly angered by Alfonsi’s memo. A transcript of Weiss’ message was provided by CBS News.\n\n“The only newsroom I’m interested in running is one in which we are able to have contentious disagreements about the thorniest editorial matters with respect and, crucially, where we assume the best intent of our colleagues,” Weiss said. “Anything else is completely unacceptable.”\n\nShe said that while Alfonsi’s story presented powerful testimony about torture at the CECOT prison, The New York Times and other outlets had already done similar work. “To run a story on this subject two months later, we need to do more,” she said. “And this is ‘60 Minutes.’ We need to be able to get the principals on the record and on camera.”\n\nIt wasn’t clear whether Weiss’ involvement in seeking administration comment was sought. She reportedly helped the newscast arrange interviews with Jared Kushner and Steve Witkoff this past fall to discuss Trump’s Middle East peace efforts. Trump himself was interviewed by Norah O’Donnell on a “60 Minutes” telecast that aired on Nov. 2.\n\nTrump has been sharply critical of “60 Minutes.” He refused to grant the show an interview prior to last fall’s election, then sued the network over how it handled an interview with election opponent Kamala Harris. CBS’ parent Paramount Global agreed to settle the lawsuit by paying Trump $16 million this past summer. More recently, Trump angrily reacted to correspondent Lesley Stahl’s interview with Trump former ally turned critic Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n“60 Minutes” was notably tough on Trump during the first months of his second term, particularly in stories done by correspondent Scott Pelley. In accepting an award from USC Annenberg earlier this month for his journalism, Pelley noted that the stories were aired last spring “with an absolute minimum of interference.”\n\nPelley said that people at “60 Minutes” were concerned about what new ownership installed at Paramount this summer would mean for the broadcast. “It’s early yet, but what I can tell you is we are doing the same kinds of stories with the same kind of rigor, and we have experienced no corporate interference of any kind,” Pelley said then, according to deadline.com.","summary":"The move is sure to increase scrutiny on CBS and “60 Minutes,” which Trump sued last fall over an interview with Kamala Harris and has recently complained about stories critical of him.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/12/22/60-minutes-cecot-piece-weiss/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/YE_US_Immigration_2025_Photo_Gallery_52647_3434ac-1.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 14:38:05","author":"Associated Press,Gqlshare","authors":["Associated Press","Gqlshare"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.392},{"id":388155676,"title":"’60 Minutes’ holds off on airing critical piece on Trump deportation policy","text":"By DAVID BAUDER, Associated Press Media Writer\n\nCBS News’ “60 Minutes” on Sunday didn’t air a planned story on Trump administration deportations of immigrants to El Salvador, pulling it only hours before airtime at the direction of new editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.\n\nThe story, where correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi spoke to deportees who had been sent to El Salvador’s notorious CECOT prison, was held because Weiss sought to add perspective from the Trump administration, according to people at the network.\n\nIn an email sent to some colleagues and reported by multiple media outlets, Alfonsi said she’d learned on Saturday that Weiss had decided not to air it.

The broadcaster said Sunday that the episode would be aired at a future date, a move that drew questions about why it was postponed at such short notice. “The broadcast lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated,” the show posted on social media just three hours before airtime. “Our report ‘Inside CECOT’ will air in a future broadcast.” NBC News has contacted CBS for comment. In a statement to The New York Times, CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss said, “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be.” “Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom,” she added. “I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.” A preview of the story had been released and shown on air and was available online. According to those clips, it profiled detainees who were deported from the United States to El Salvador’s notorious Center for the Confinement of Terrorism, or CECOT. One clip showed correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaking about how these prisoners were “shackled, paraded in front of cameras,” and saying that they had endured “four months of hell” at the facility. The Trump administration sent about 250 Venezuelan men to CECOT in March and has accused them of being members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Many of the men and some of their families and attorneys have denied the claim. On Monday, the \"60 Minutes\" webpage promoting the report had been removed. Instead, it read: “The page cannot be found. The page may have been removed, had its name changed, or is just temporarily unavailable.” Alfonsi said the segment was pulled for “political” reasons, according to a private note sent to CBS colleagues that was reported by the Times. “Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” the Times reported Alfonsi wrote in the note, which it had obtained a copy of, the newspaper said. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one,” she said in the note, the Times reported. Asked for further comment by the newspaper Sunday evening, Alfonsi said: “I refer all questions to Bari Weiss.” It's the latest in a string of controversies for CBS and its parent company, the newly formed Paramount Skydance. Last year, President Donald Trump filed a lawsuit against Paramount, accusing “60 Minutes” of deceptively editing an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. CBS denied the claim. Paramount settled Trump’s lawsuit for $16 million. Skydance chief David Ellison has sought to reshape the news business, appointing Weiss — a television newcomer and prominent critic of liberal media — as editor in chief after acquiring her outlet, The Free Press. In seeking federal approval of the merger with Paramount, Skydance vowed to embrace “diverse viewpoints” and represent “the varied ideological perspectives of American viewers.” Sunday's decision drew criticism from some Democrats. “What is happening to CBS is a terrible embarrassment and if executives think they can build shareholder value by avoiding journalism that might offend the Mad King they are about to learn a tough lesson,” Sen. Brian Schatz, D-Hawaii, said. The decision “does merit an explanation right away. It’s a pretty big deal to pull a story at the request of the White House,” he wrote on X. NBC News has reached out to the White House for comment.","summary":"CBS News pulled a “60 Minutes” report about the Trump administration sending detainees to a maximum security “mega prison” in El Salvador just hours before its scheduled broadcast","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/cbs-60-minutes-story-trump-deportees-el-salvador-bari-weiss-rcna250441","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251222-bari-weiss-rs-c137ed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 14:16:22","author":"Alexander Smith","authors":["Alexander Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":388174446,"title":"3 years of Trump Presidency left, half of Americans already focused on 2028 &#8211; What new poll shows","text":"With three years still left in President Donald Trump’s second term, many Americans are already looking ahead to the 2028 presidential election, according to a new poll. A CNN-SSRS poll conducted between December 4 and 7 found that half of US adults have already thought about the next election. About 22 percent said they have thought about it “a lot,” and 28 percent said they have thought about it “some.” Still, most people don’t have a clear favourite yet. Nearly two-thirds of respondents said they don’t have a specific person in mind for 2028, while one-third named a potential candidate.

Only one respondent named candidates from both parties, telling CNN they preferred “Mitt Romney or Mark Kelly.” What voters want in the next president Those without a preferred candidate were asked what qualities mattered most in the next president, with responses collected in an open-ended format. Honesty emerged as the top response. Twelve percent said they want a president who is truthful and does not lie. Another 9 percent said they want someone who is compassionate, empathetic, and genuinely cares about people. When asked about the most important issues, affordability and cost of living ranked at the top. Six percent of respondents mentioned it. Other issues received fewer mentions. Three percent said they want a president focused on “America first” or prioritising US interests over foreign affairs. Healthcare, foreign policy, and federal spending were each mentioned by 2 percent of respondents. Even before returning to the White House, Trump has repeatedly teased the idea of running again. He has even sold “Trump 2028 hats.” In October, Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One, “I would love to do it. I have my best numbers ever” Two days after those remarks, Trump walked them back, stating that the Constitution clearly bars him from running again. Still, Bannon continued to push the idea. In November, he said on his War Room show that he believed, “you can drive a Mack truck through the 22nd Amendment,” he told reporters. He added that this view came from a “top constitutional lawyer.” Earlier this month, Trump again created speculation. At a White House Christmas party, he said he had just a “little more than three years” left in his term.

Discovery with new Larry Ellison guarantee","text":"Paramount and its controlling shareholders, the billionaire Ellison family, said the company was building out its bid for Warner Bros. Discovery on Monday. The amended bid seeks to address a number of specific concerns that Warner Bros. Discovery's board said it had with Paramount's proposed $108 billion deal. Warner is already moving ahead with a deal to sell its television, movie and streaming assets to Netflix, making the Paramount bid a hostile one. Paramount says it would still pay shareholders $30 per share in cash, but Oracle chairman and billionaire Larry Ellison is getting more personally involved in backing the offer. \"Larry Ellison has agreed to provide an irrevocable personal guarantee of $40.4 billion of the equity financing for the offer and any damages claims against Paramount,\" Paramount said in a news release. \"Mr. Ellison has agreed not to revoke the Ellison family trust (which has been operating for nearly 40 years as a counterparty to numerous transactions) or adversely transfer its assets during the pendency of the transaction,\" Paramount also said. Larry Ellison's personal fortune is currently worth more than $240 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires, much of it in Oracle stock. Paramount said it would also increase the fee paid to Warner Bros. Discovery if the deal is terminated from $5 billion to $5.8 billion, matching what Netflix agreed to. That's one of the largest so-called \"break-up fees\" ever offered in a merger. Spokespeople for Netflix and Warner Bros. did not immediately reply to requests for comment Monday. On Wednesday, Warner Bros. Discovery Chairman Samuel Di Piazza told CNBC that the company's concerns with Paramount's bid centered around the Ellison family's backing. \"Nowhere in any of these proposals did Larry Ellison guarantee,\" he said. \"Obviously, the ability to deal directly with Larry if there was an issue to close would be critical.\" Earlier that day, Warner Bros. Discovery's board recommended that shareholders reject the Paramount hostile bid and said it was still committed to the earlier deal it agreed to with Netflix. Paramount is seeking to acquire all of Warner Bros. Discovery, while Netflix is seeking only to acquire its film studio, streaming service and HBO network. The media company controlled by the Ellisons has also claimed it could get regulatory approval from the Trump administration more easily than Netflix could. Earlier this year, the Ellisons acquired Paramount Global with approval from the Trump administration. But that approval only came after CBS News agreed to pay $16 million to President Donald Trump's future presidential library over an interview that \"60 Minutes\" had conducted with then-presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump claimed that the interview was misleading. The settlement did \"not include a statement of apology or regret,\" CBS said at the time. After the deal closed, Paramount CEO David Ellison installed longtime commentary writer Bari Weiss as editor-in-chief of CBS News. Paramount also bought Weiss' online news site, The Free Press. Tensions flared at CBS yet again this past weekend over a \"60 Minutes\" story. After announcing Friday that it would be airing a story titled \"Inside CECOT\" and promoting the story on social media, Weiss pulled the piece from Sunday's broadcast, and CBS announced the decision just hours before it was set to run. Sharyn Alfonsi, the correspondent who reported the story, told her CBS colleagues in an email that the decision was \"political\" and not editorial, according to a copy of her email obtained by The New York Times and multiple other outlets. \"Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,\" Alfonsi wrote. \"It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.\" A Warner Bros. Discovery takeover would give the Ellisons and Paramount control of CNN, the global news network that is a fixture of Trump's rants against the media. Trump has said he will take a direct role in approving any Warner Bros. Discovery deal. He recently told reporters that he thinks it is \"imperative that CNN be sold.\" \"I don’t think the people that are running that company right now...should be allowed to continue,\" Trump said at a White House event on Dec. 10. Trump has also repeatedly criticized individual CNN reporters. However, in recent days Trump has complained about the Ellisons. \"For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called 'takeover,' than they have ever treated me before,\" Trump posted on Truth Social Dec. 16. \"If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!\" he added.","summary":"Paramount and its controlling shareholders, the billionaire Ellison family, said the company was building out its bid for Warner Bros.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/media/paramount-warner-bros-larry-ellison-rcna250453","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250609-warner-bros-discovery-mb-1246-810546.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 13:46:40","author":"Steve Kopack","authors":["Steve Kopack"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"na","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":388174532,"title":"The Great Indian Ghar Wapsi: Why NRIs are packing their bags and coming home","text":"For decades, leaving India was almost a rite of passage.

Close to one million Indians have renounced their citizenship over the last five years, with annual numbers crossing the two-lakh mark consistently since 2022, according to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA). But as 2025 draws to a close, a powerful shift is underway. The very people who once left in search of opportunity are now looking back home. This is not a story of failure, nor is it always about dreams fully achieved. It was more about fatigue, fear, belonging, and a change, that India suddenly feels more like home than ever before. Call it the reverse exodus. Call it coming full circle. or simply, The Great Indian Wapsi. A growing pull back to home While covering NRI affairs over the past year, one trend kept repeating itself, across social media, private conversations, and lived experiences. More NRIs are actively planning a return to India. Even as there was no certain number attached to the trend, a recent survey by SBNRI, a fintech platform, explains this shift clearly. Nearly 60% of NRIs in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and Singapore are considering returning to India after retirement. The intent is strongest among NRIs in Australia and Singapore, where nearly 80% want to return, followed by 75% in the US, 70% in the UK, and 63% in Canada. This is not a distant plan anymore. Many have already started investing in India, buying property, shifting savings, and building a financial base for life back home. What makes this generation different is that they are returning to an India that no longer resembles the one they left. A digitally transformed economy, improving infrastructure, a growing middle class, better lifestyle options, affordable healthcare, and cultural familiarity have made India an emotionally and practically viable choice again. ALSO READ‘H-1B stability now a ticking clock,’ laid-off techie gives a reality check Visa uncertainty and the H-1B nightmare Among NRIs, visa anxiety has emerged as one of the strongest push factors. H-1B visa, once a symbol of opportunity, has increasingly become a source of stress. One major development in 2025 was the hike in H-1B application fees. This led several tech companies to cut back on H-1B hiring, shrinking access for Indian professionals. Indians account for nearly 72% of H-1B visas, making them the most vulnerable to any policy shift. Add to that stricter social media vetting, tighter rules for H-4 visas, and widespread rescheduling of visa interviews, and the uncertainty becomes exhausting. Many Indians in the US admit they hesitate to even take a vacation. The fear is simple and constant, what if a new regulation comes in while they are away, blocking re-entry? That fear has only increased over the past year. H-1B visa was introduced under the Immigration Act of 1990 to help US employers fill skill gaps when American talent was unavailable. Today, that original purpose feels diluted. President Donald Trump signed an executive order requiring employers to pay a $100,000 annual fee for H-1B visas to curb what he called the “overuse of the program”. For many NRIs, this turned out to be a breaking point. The emotional cost of living in limbo no longer feels worth it. ALSO READGreen Card: How to become a US permanent resident without leaving America Deportation fears and the loss of security Beyond visas, a deeper fear now looms, deportation. Imagine living in the US for 30 years, building a life, raising a family, paying taxes, only to face deportation at the final stage of your green card process. This is exactly what happened to Babblejit “Bubble” Singh, whose case shocked immigrant communities. These fears are no longer isolated. As Trump took charge for a second term, immigration enforcement tightened further, creating anxiety even among long-term residents. The United States has deported 3,155 Indian nationals in 2025 so far, as of November 21. But it was the visuals from February this year that deeply shook India. In February 2025, 104 Indian nationals, including women and children, were deported on a US military C-17 aircraft after nearly 40 hours of being handcuffed and leg-shackled. Videos released by the US Border Patrol showed deportees boarding the aircraft in restraints, leading to outrage in India, with many calling the treatment “inhumane” and “degrading.” Families of the deportees alleged they were denied basic human necessities, including bathroom access, proper meals, and medical care during the journey. Several said their relatives were treated like “prisoners,” despite not being violent offenders. For many Indians watching from home, the images of shackled citizens served as a grim reminder that for NRIs and migrants abroad, even decades of residence offer no guarantee of dignity or security, a reality that is increasingly pushing many to rethink life outside India. Racism, loneliness, and growing anti-Indian sentiment Financial stability has not translated into emotional fulfilment for many NRIs. Loneliness and social alienation are recurring themes in online forums and personal stories. Several NRIs speak of a lack of community, weak social bonds, and the absence of everyday warmth they associate with life in India. On top of that, racism has become harder to ignore. According to the AAPI Equity Alliance’s Stop AAPI Hate report, over 75% of anti-Asian hate speech between December 2024 and January 2025 was aimed at South Asians. A group called Moonshot, which tracks online hate, found more than 44,000 racist slurs against South Asians in extremist online spaces between May and June 2025. A study titled Anti-Indian Racism on X by the Center for the Study of Organized Hate found that between July 1 and September 7, 2025, nearly 700 hateful posts against Indians received over 281 million views on the platform. Even prominent public figures of Indian origin have not been spared. Vice President Kamala Harris and Usha Vance faced online abuse, telling us the feeling among ordinary NRIs that acceptance remains conditional. Political tensions have only worsened perceptions. It is being widely propagated by Trump supporters, aka MAGA community, that Indians on H-1Bs are stealing their jobs. With the unemployment rate at an all-time low Americans have found a villain in disguise and assume that H-1B visa suspension will help in more jobs for them. What's less known is that Indian Americans only constitute 1.5% of the overall workforce in the country, according to Indiaspora & Boston Consulting Group report.This small demographic pays an estimated $250–$300 billion in income taxes and heads 16 Fortune 500 companies. For many NRIs, the question became painfully simple, why stay where you constantly have to prove you belong? Family, culture, and the need to belong At the heart of the Great Indian Wapsi lies something deeply personal, family. India’s family-centric culture is difficult to replicate abroad. NRIs often speak of missing festivals, weddings, everyday conversations, and shared meals. For parents, the distance from ageing parents back home weighs heavily. For NRIs with children, there is a growing concern that their kids are growing up disconnected from Indian traditions, language, and cultural values. Returning to India offers something money cannot buy, a sense of belonging. Being present for family milestones, raising children closer to their roots, and ageing with emotional support nearby has become a powerful motivator. Government initiatives and structured returns Government has also created frameworks that make returning easier. MEA issues Emergency Certificates for Indian nationals returning without standard documentation. India has signed multiple migration and mobility agreements that include structured repatriation mechanisms. MoUs with countries like Malaysia cover recruitment, employment, and repatriation of workers. Migration and Mobility Partnership Agreements, such as the one with Moldova, facilitate mobility ensuring orderly return. India-UK MMPA focuses on regulated movement and return procedures, especially to prevent irregular migration. These steps, though procedural, send a clear message, coming home is supported. Coming home to a new India NRIs returning today are not coming back to the India they once left. They are returning to a country that has changed, and so have they. The Great Indian Wapsi is not about abandoning global dreams. It is about choosing emotional safety over uncertainty, belonging over alienation, and roots over restlessness. For many NRIs, home is no longer just a memory. It is a future they are finally ready to reclaim.","url":"https://www.financialexpress.com/business/investing-abroad-the-great-indian-ghar-wapsi-why-nris-are-packing-their-bags-and-coming-home-4083603/","image":"https://images.financialexpressdigital.com/2025/12/Untitled-1200-x-675-px-6.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 13:05:18","author":"Anjana Pv","authors":["Anjana Pv"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.045},{"id":388148048,"title":"CECOT CBS 60 Minutes Delay Linked to Trump Deportee Plan — Tax Dollars Down $150K+","text":"CBS's flagship investigative programme, 60 Minutes, has abruptly shelved a high-cost segment examining the controversial El Salvador megaprison housing US deportees, prompting fresh concerns about media accountability and the real price Americans are paying for President Donald Trump's immigration policies.\n\nThe iconic newsmagazine confirmed that the segment titled 'Inside CECOT' would be broadcast at a later date rather than its scheduled Sunday slot. The timing has raised eyebrows, coming just days after Trump publicly praised CBS's new owners, the Ellison family, at a rally in North Carolina on Friday.\n\nWhat the Delay Could Cost Viewers and Taxpayers\n\nInvestigative segments of this kind typically require substantial resources. Industry data suggests that 60 Minutes' overseas reporting, especially in high-security environments requiring specialised access, insurance, and security measures, can cost between $125,000 to $200,000 (£93,000 to £149,300) per segment.\n\nWith production costs likely exceeding $150,000 (£111,900), the delayed segment represents a significant investment in accountability journalism—aimed at scrutinising how American tax dollars fund Trump's controversial deportation programme.\n\nFor the CECOT investigation, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi gained rare access inside the Terrorism Confinement Centre, interviewing deportees who described 'four months of hell' in the maximum-security facility. Such access demands extensive pre-production planning, security arrangements, and on-ground logistics—all of which are now on hold.\n\n'Did you think you were going to die there?' Alfonsi asked one deportee.\n\n'We thought we were already the living dead,' the deportee replied.\n\nCBS News stated the segment was pulled because it 'needed additional reporting'.\n\nThe Deportation Programme Under the Microscope\n\nThe shelved report was set to expand on earlier 60 Minutes coverage that revealed troubling findings about the administration's deportation justifications. A previous investigation found that 75% of the 238 men sent to CECOT in March had no criminal record. Only 22% had any criminal history, mostly for non-violent offences such as theft, shoplifting, and trespassing. Three per cent had unclear records.\n\nAmong those deported was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father whose case became a flashpoint after the Trump administration admitted he was wrongfully removed due to an 'administrative error'. Following a Supreme Court order instructing the government to 'facilitate' his return, he was brought back to the US on 6 June 2025.\n\nThe administration accused the deportees of links to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, yet data suggests the vast majority posed no documented threat.\n\nWhy This Matters for Your Wallet\n\nAmerican taxpayers are funding these deportation operations—from transportation and detention costs to diplomatic arrangements with El Salvador's government. When investigations into such expenditure are delayed, public oversight diminishes, raising concerns over transparency.\n\nTrump has worked closely with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele to establish the CECOT programme. He has also floated the idea of expanding it to include 'homegrown criminals', potentially US citizens.\n\n'There is no provision under US law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country,' said Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert at the University of Notre Dame.\n\nQuestions of Editorial Independence\n\nTrump's complex relationship with 60 Minutes adds another layer. Paramount, CBS's parent company, paid Trump $16M (£11.9) in July 2025 to settle a lawsuit over a 2024 interview with Kamala Harris, which he claimed was unfairly edited.\n\n'For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called takeover,' Trump wrote on Truth Social last week, even as he publicly praised the network's new leadership.\n\nWhether the delay reflects editorial caution, logistical issues, or external pressure remains unclear. What is certain is that a significant investment in accountability journalism—examining how taxpayer funds support controversial deportation policies—has been postponed, with no confirmed broadcast date.\n\nFor viewers seeking transparency on immigration spending, the wait continues.\n\nOriginally published on IBTimes UK","summary":"CBS's 60 Minutes delays costly CECOT prison investigation after Trump praises network owners, raising questions about media transparency on deportation spending.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/cecot-cbs-60-minutes-delay-linked-trump-deportee-plan-tax-dollars-down-150k-3793408","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4638196/prison.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 13:03:25","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.297},{"id":388139574,"title":"Why Nicki Minaj Appearance at TPUSA AmericaFest Matters","text":"I know you will be shocked to learn this, but unlike Ed, I am not an expert on popular culture. Ed makes so many cultural references that fly over my head that I feel like a 19th-century curmudgeon. \n\nThe truth is that I am a 20th-century curmudgeon, I suppose, but that is my charm. I'm sure of it. \n\nSo while I know a fair bit about Cardi B because she has inserted herself in politics, I know less about Nicki Minaj. I knew she was an American Idol judge through commercials, and when I looked her up just now, I learned she holds the record for the most Billboard Hot 100 entries by a woman across all genres.\n\nI also recently saw her comments about Gavin Newsom, JD Vance, and President Trump, but I never expected to see her show up on the stage at a TPUSA event. \n\nNicki Minaj: Being at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest More Important than Any Concert I’ve Performed, Because Charlie Kirk’s Organization ‘Is a Direct Link Betweenhttps://t.co/OmRnhBHSQt pic.twitter.com/dNxDNehP6B— Andrew Kolvet (@AndrewKolvet) December 21, 2025\n\nBut why should I care? After all, celebrities rarely influence their listeners to vote, despite far too much exposure to their idiotic political positions. It's not like Taylor Swift or Cardi B carried Kamala Harris over the finish line. \n\nThe short answer is WHY Nicky Minaj has decided to come out as leaning conservative. It's not because her political views will change the minds of millions of her young followers; it's because she is speaking up about her deep attachment to Christianity. \n\n“I’ve traveled the world. I’ve performed for huge crowds all around the world, and no matter how many songs I do on that stage, it didn’t mean as much as this, because this is a direct link between young people and God.,” Minaj said.The “Super Bass” singer, who spoke at Turning Point USA’s 2025 AmericaFest on Sunday, went on to say that there has been “a lack” of God “in our media” and “in our everyday conversations.”“You know, interestingly enough, Christians have been persecuted right here in our country in different ways,” she added. “So, when we talk about Nigeria and other countries, know that prior administrations saw nothing wrong with that.”“And that’s what was wrong with that,” Minaj asserted.“I truly feel that there are people out there who felt good about chastising Christians right here in our country,” the “Anaconda” singer continued, calling it “really sick.”\n\nCelebrities' influence stems from their status as cultural icons, and while politics is downstream from culture, getting people to vote for a particular individual who, in themselves, is the antithesis of cool is a tough sell. A kid might, for some reason, find Cardi B cool, but despite all the \"Brat Summer\" hype, Kamala Harris could never be made to seem cool to people. \n\nBut when a celebrity who is already seen as culturally cool pushes back against the cultural hostility to Christianity, it might just make a difference in the audience's mind in a way that \"vote for X\" might not. \n\nNicki Minaj says being at Turning Point USA’s AmericaFest is more important than any concert she's ever performed.“Because this is a direct link between young people and God.”“People who have a problem with us worshiping God… we absolutely cannot have them power.” pic.twitter.com/A9IplWRCKR— Alana Mastrangelo (@ARmastrangelo) December 21, 2025\n\nAfter all, much of the hostility to Christianity stems from a cultural hostility to its values, and a sense that being Christian means you are like the Saturday Night Live \"Church Lady.\"\n\nBREAKING: Nikki Minaj speaks out about Islamists persecuting Christians around the world.“We will speak up for Christians wherever they are in this world!”Nikki has more moral clarity on this subject than Tucker Carlson.pic.twitter.com/Blmm65tnoB— Eyal Yakoby (@EYakoby) December 21, 2025\n\nNikki Minaj is no church lady, that's for sure. When she openly embraces God and embraces TPUSA not for its politics but for its cultural import, that may mean something. \n\n🚨 BREAKING: Nicki Minaj just said the left needs to STOP putting down white peopleNicki says if black women felt put down in the past, \"why would we want to do that to OTHER women?!\"\"I don't need someone with blonde hair and blue eyes to downplay their beauty, because I know… pic.twitter.com/zGxPLEMtdN— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) December 21, 2025\n\nAs significant as Charlie Kirk was as a political figure in the conservative movement, his actual influence was concentrated among the young because he spoke to them about their particular concerns in their own language. He was not a pundit, as so many others are, but became a fixture in the culture of college-age kids. \n\nHe was an intellectual, sure. But that was not his superpower, the way it would be for Ben Shapiro, who (sorry, Ben) was never cool. That's not a knock on Ben in the least; their influence flows from different springs.\n\nDoes one appearance by a rap star at a conservative event signal a cultural shift? Of course not. But will it matter that Minaj is speaking out about her faith in God? \n\nI suspect the answer is \"Yes.\"\n\nEditor’s Note: The Democrat Party has never been less popular as voters reject its globalist agenda.Help us continue exposing Democrats' plans to lead America down a dangerous path.

Now one of its own correspondents fears the program is being “dismantled,” and some employees are threatening to quit.\n\nThe trigger: CBS News suddenly shelved a segment featuring the accounts of Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador.\n\nThe correspondent who reported the story, Sharyn Alfonsi, said in an internal memo that “the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship.”\n\nAccording to Alfonsi and two CBS sources who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity, the story had been fully fact-checked and legally vetted by the time the network publicized it on Friday afternoon.\n\nBut CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss weighed in with questions on Saturday morning, the two sources said. Alfonsi said Weiss “spiked the story.”\n\nOne of the main issues Weiss raised was the lack of a response from the Trump administration to the reporting.\n\nAccording to Alfonsi, “we requested responses to questions and/or interviews with DHS, the White House, and the State Department.”\n\nBut the administration did not engage, which concerned Weiss. At one point, Weiss suggested that the program try to interview White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, and provided Miller’s number, one of the CBS sources said.\n\nAlfonsi argued in her memo that the administration’s strategic silence cannot be allowed to become a “veto” of a critical story.\n\n“Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story,” she wrote. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.”\n\nWeiss responded in a statement to The New York Times late Sunday night, “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.”\n\nEarlier in the day, CBS News said of the decision to hold the segment, “We determined it needed additional reporting.”\n\nBut Alfonsi disputed that in her memo. “Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” she wrote. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now—after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\n“60 Minutes” segments are commonly screened several times before air, but five screenings is an unusually high number, the CBS sources said.\n\nIt is unclear when Weiss first viewed the story. But she has recently become personally involved in “60 Minutes” stories about politics, the CBS sources told CNN.\n\nIn another recent turn of events, President Trump has been blasting the newsmagazine on Truth Social, sounding disappointed in CBS’s new owners.\n\nIn late 2024, Trump sued CBS and its parent company, Paramount, then under different ownership, alleging “60 Minutes” deceptively edited a Kamala Harris interview to benefit her campaign.\n\nThat lawsuit, which legal experts widely viewed to be legally dubious, loomed large over Paramount’s attempt to merge with Skydance Media, a production company led by David Ellison and supported by Ellison’s father, Larry, the Oracle billionaire.\n\nThe lawsuit became a flashpoint inside CBS News, where journalists worried that both the old and new corporate leaders sought to mollify Trump at the cost of the newsroom’s credibility.\n\nEventually, the outgoing Paramount leadership team agreed to settle Trump’s lawsuit, and the incoming leadership team agreed to several concessions that satisfied the Trump-aligned FCC.\n\nDavid Ellison took control of Paramount, lavished praise on “60 Minutes,” and said he wanted to strengthen CBS News. Then he acquired Weiss’s startup, The Free Press, for $150 million, and installed her as editor-in-chief.\n\nNow in charge of both operations, Weiss has faced media industry skepticism about her lack of experience with TV management and traditional reporting.\n\nAt the end of October, Weiss traveled to Mar-a-Lago when CBS journalist Norah O’Donnell taped a “60 Minutes” sit-down with President Trump.\n\nThe president praised Weiss during the interview, though not by name, adding, “I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person.”\n\nEarlier that same month, Trump also said of the Ellisons, “they’re friends of mine. Big — they’re big supporters of mine, and they’ll do the right thing.”\n\nOver the past two weeks, however, Trump has lashed out at Ellison, who is currently waging a politically sensitive hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s owner.\n\nOn Dec. 8, he posted a screed against “60 Minutes” for interviewing Marjorie Taylor Greene, and claimed that since Paramount changed hands, the program “has actually gotten WORSE!” He repeated that opinion on Dec. 16, adding, “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!”\n\nThe timing of his most recent complaint, on Friday night, coincided with the behind-the-scenes drama at “60 Minutes.”\n\n“I love the new owners of CBS,” Trump said at a rally. “Something happens to them, though. ‘60 Minutes’ has treated me worse under the new ownership than… they just keep treating me, they just keep hitting me, it’s crazy.”\n\nBy then, CBS was already promoting the upcoming story, titled “INSIDE CECOT.”\n\nFriday afternoon’s press release said “correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaks with some of the now released deportees, who describe the brutal and torturous conditions they endured inside CECOT.”\n\nAlfonsi said in her memo, of those interviewees, “These men risked their lives to speak with us. We have a moral and professional obligation to the sources who entrusted us with their stories. Abandoning them now is a betrayal of the most basic tenet of journalism: giving voice to the voiceless.”","url":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/article/cbs-shelves-60-minutes-story-on-trump-deportees-at-the-last-minute-people-are-threatening-to-quit-staffers-say/","image":"https://www.ctvnews.ca/resizer/v2/POL53NXE2JEMRGDYER4N5UZL44.JPG?auth=540fa62e0d421958d0a17a580870c36cf41ddc0d27d99c95e71daf4cf43578b0","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 12:32:09","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":388210406,"title":"How Mark Kelly became Arizona's unlikely national media star | Opinion","text":"I was channel surfing the cable news networks the other day when I came across a now familiar sight in the CNN studio: Arizona's senior U.S. senator, Mark Kelly.\n\nI was not surprised.\n\nA U.S. Senator can’t exactly be anonymous, but Kelly, at least on a media front, was pretty quiet after winning a special election in 2020 to replace the late Sen. John McCain. He kept a pretty low profile after winning again in 2022. After Ruben Gallego, no shrinking violet, won election to the Senate in 2024, if you were going to bet who would have the bigger media presence at the end of 2025, you wouldn’t have put your money on Kelly.\n\nAnd yet here we are.\n\nKelly is everywhere, seemingly all the time. Not only has his profile increased by an order of magnitude, he’s also getting high marks ― in some circles ― for his no-nonsense, straightforward approach. It’s a welcome change from the non-stop bombast we’ve grown accustomed to from the Trump administration. There is no question about it: Mark Kelly has become an unlikely media star.\n\nTicking off Donald Trump will do that for you.\n\nFrom Barry Goldwater to Kari Lake, Arizona has long had a big national media presence\n\nArizona has never wanted for political figures who have loomed large in the media world. Barry Goldwater was outspoken as the Republican candidate for president in 1964. Mo Udall ran for president as a Democrat in 1976 and is more remembered for his sense of humor with the media than his policies. (“If you can find something everyone agrees on, it’s wrong.”)\n\nMore recently, John McCain ran for president twice and won the Republican nomination in 2008, losing the general election to Barack Obama. McCain based a lot of his campaign on being a straight shooter ― his campaign bus was called the Straight Talk Express. That only went so far, though. He kicked Kris Mayes, then a reporter for The Arizona Republic, now the Arizona Attorney General, off the Straight Talk Express, because he was unhappy with opinion pieces the paper had written.\n\nThen there is Kari Lake. She is a category unto herself. The former Phoenix news anchor modeled herself after Trump, with her scorched-earth campaign style, attacks on the media (irony) and lies about the 2020 election. The difference being that Trump won a couple of elections. Lake didn’t, but she became a true MAGA star, at least for a time.\n\nThat's how it went for Arizona and its presence in the national media for a while there. Remember the 2020 election audit conducted by Cyber Ninjas? What a joke. Or Lake's refusal to concede defeat in the 2022 gubernatorial election? Or the Arizona Republican Party tweeting that \"mainstream media is Domestic Terrorists?\" Absurd antics like those gave the state a black eye in terms of national coverage.\n\nKelly is not without controversy, to be sure. But it is refreshing to have someone from Arizona making news for taking a principled stand against the Trump administration's threats to democracy.\n\nRuben Gallego is no stranger to media coverage, either\n\nGallego made plenty of media splashes as a U.S. Representative. And he hasn’t exactly faded into the woodwork since becoming a senator. He’s still a dependable headline generator, for good and bad. He comes off as kind of a guy’s guy, with the colorful language to prove it. He scores high on the fun-to-have-a-beer-with scale.\n\nKelly, a former astronaut, is different. He’s quieter, more measured. The husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, he stood by her side during her rehabilitation after she was shot and her gradual reemergence in public life, if in a limited way. He didn’t steal, or even seek, the spotlight, but was a steady presence all the same.\n\nIt’s not like he was invisible as a politician. He did have to run for office, after all ― hardly an anonymous quest. There was talk of him being Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election, a slot that went to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Walz has a more folksy persona than Kelly, or just about anyone else. Harris has said one of the reasons she didn’t choose Kelly was because she wasn’t sure how he would have emerged from Trump’s attacks.\n\nNow we know. Shoulda coulda woulda.\n\nTrump's reelection gave Kelly and Gallego a stronger platform\n\nTrump's reelection gave Kelly ― and Gallego ― more opportunities to speak out against the changes Trump has rammed through since taking office again. It’s a lot easier to make waves by going against the grain than going along with it. Another way of putting it: Kelly and Gallego say more interesting things in opposition to Trump than Republican sycophants who just parrot the party line.\n\nThen came the video.\n\nOn Nov. 18, Kelly and other lawmakers posted a video reminding military service members that they are obligated to refuse illegal orders. \"Our laws are clear,\" Kelly says in the video. \"You can refuse illegal orders.\" Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania says, \"You must refuse illegal orders.\" It’s something service members are taught during basic training, though it was clearly meant to goad Trump and his administration as they deploy U.S. troops to American cities.\n\nFor his part, Trump responded to the video about how you’d expect. He accused the people in the video of “seditious behavior” which he said was “punishable by death!” He also reposted posts such as: “HANG THEM GEORGE WASHINGTON WOULD!” Totally normal behavior.\n\nUnder any other administration, threatening lawmakers with death for exercising free speech would have been a huge story, an unhinged rant worthy of deep scrutiny and consequence. With this one, it was just another Thursday.\n\nBut Kelly didn’t take the threats lying down. If he was cowed, he didn’t show it. Instead, he has gone on the offensive, calling out Trump and his threats. The Defense Department has said it will open a “command investigation” for “serious allegations of conduct.” Kelly seems unbowed.\n\nKelly is more media savvy than he might first appear\n\nMeanwhile, he was back in the news for getting into an argument with Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth over the video during a closed-door briefing that was supposed to be about the administration’s second military strike on a suspected drug boat in international waters. The second strike killed the survivors of a first strike.\n\nThe key there is “back in the news,” and it may be a little misleading. Kelly was never really out of the news, and hasn’t been since the video aired. There are no signs that he will be anytime soon.\n\nYou don’t become a U.S. Senator without wanting to be. It takes a certain amount of ego and desire to be seen and heard. What Kelly has managed to do is downplay that ambition. He doesn’t seem hungry for the spotlight; in fact, he gives the impression the spotlight has been thrust upon him.\n\nBut watch his media appearances. He’s savvy. He knows how to needle Trump and MAGA, increasingly so. He lacks the aw-shucks demeanor of a Walz, certainly (that demeanor is no accident). He’s not as earthy as Gallego.\n\nHe is, however, a former astronaut and a husband who has supported his wife in a public way after unimaginable tragedy and grueling rehabilitation. The mark of a successful politician is being able to meet the moment, no matter how that moment arrives.\n\nKelly has done that. It’s going to be interesting to see how long the moment ― and his star turn ― lasts.\n\nSedition? Hanging?

Critics have particularly balked at the network’s creation of a new ombudsman role, filled by longtime conservative policy wonk Kenneth Weinstein, to evaluate allegations of bias leveled at the company, per conditions under which the Trump administration’s Federal Communications Commission approved the merger.\n\nWidespread concern over the future editorial direction of CBS appeared to have been borne out earlier in November after the network was accused of buckling to pressure from Trump over what material to broadcast from a 60 Minutes sit-down with the president. \n\nCompared against the extended 73-minute cut released online, the final 28-minute TV edit of that interview was found to have excluded the president losing his cool over questions about his controversial decision to pardon a crypto-billionaire who had been convicted of money laundering.\n\nAlso cut from the broadcast version were the president’s boasts about securing a multi-million dollar payout from Paramount over his claims the network had deceptively edited a separate interview with Kamala Harris to give the then-Democratic candidate a boost in last year’s polls. \n\nResponding to the mounting firestorm over the pulled CECOT segment Sunday, Weiss told The New York Times that “holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom.”\n\n“I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready,” she added. \n\nBut in a leaked memo to the 60 Minutes team, veteran reporter Sharyn Alfonsi blasted Weiss for allegedly making the decision out of deference to the MAGA administration, rather than a code of journalistic ethics. \n\n“Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” she wrote. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now—after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.”\n\nAlfonsi added that due requests for comment on the piece had been sent to the Department of Homeland Security, the White House and the State Department. These allegedly went unanswered, with the lack of response received as “a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story.”\n\n“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,” she wrote. “I care too much about this broadcast to watch it be dismantled without a fight.”","summary":"FIFA via Getty ImagesStaff at 60 Minutes are threatening to quit after the network’s MAGA-curious chief allegedly shelved a chilling segment on the Trump administration’s nationwide deportation drive. \n\n“Inside [60 Minutes], where journalistic independence is sacrosanct, ‘people are threatening to quit over this,” I’m told,” CNN’s chief media analyst Brian Stelter posted late Sunday night of the mounting firestorm.\n\nCBS had announced earlier in the afternoon it would pull a 60 Minutes segment otherwise billed as an inside look at “brutal and torturous conditions” at CECOT, the feared El Salvadoran megaprison to which the MAGA administration has deported hundreds of migrants this year.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/cbss-60-minutes-staff-threaten-to-walk-after-baris-weiss-kills-major-donald-trump-story/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/SULMJ5RMQRGEXOGNWJ4D4IE2BA.jpg?smart=true&auth=66a3df6c47ce92b2cc8be8ef35b2ec85592715b102ad7f59fe88d09c299c9ccd&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 11:57:43","author":"Will Neal","authors":["Will Neal"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.205},{"id":388139630,"title":"Meltdown at CBS News: 60 Minutes Dumps Fawning Illegal Alien Deportation Segment at Last Second","text":"We’ve reported extensively on the shenanigans at CBS News, the network that was forced to fork over $16 million in July to settle Trump’s lawsuit concerning their deceptive editing of a Kamala Harris interview a month before the 2024 presidential election. Much drama ensued at the outlet as veteran diehards continued to insist that resisting Trump and spewing anti-American rhetoric was part of their job description. \n\nGive credit, however, to David Ellison, Chairman and CEO of Paramount (Skydance Corporation), who brought on independent journalist, former NY Times opinion editor, and nowadays free thinker Bari Weiss to oversee the hopelessly biased CBS team. This caused much consternation, of course, because the liberal media isn’t used to being called out on the carpet or having to justify their excesses.\n\nCould it be her fingerprint on the latest drama engulfing the network? On Sunday, the venerable show 60 Minutes abruptly yanked a planned segment on illegal aliens.\n\nInformation was scant:\n\nCBS pulled a “60 Minutes” segment on Venezuelan migrants who were sent to El Salvador’s notorious maximum-security prison, CECOT, just hours before its scheduled Sunday broadcast time. “The broadcast lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated,” the program ‌posted in an Editor’s Note on social media three hours before it was set to air. “Our report ‘Inside CECOT’ will air in a future broadcast,” the post said. \n\nAs RedState’s Rusty Weiss reported, the segment had been under fire even before it aired:\n\nMEDIA BIAS, PERSONIFIED: 60 Minutes Torched Over Interview With Illegals Whining About 'Four Months of Hell' in El Salvador Prison\n\nBari Weiss said in a statement that more context was needed, which is code for “the story was hopelessly biased and leftist, and we’re trying to become something more trustworthy under my leadership.”\n\nThe segment sounds as if it was going to be yet another mainstream media “Maryland Man” story glorifying illegal alien criminals while ignoring their crimes and minimizing the disastrous impact Joe Biden’s “let them all in” border policy has had on our country. But, according to some, Weiss has seen enough of that duplicitous narrative:\n\nThe segment was set to feature correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaking to deportees, who spoke about the 'brutal and torturous' conditions at the prison. Explaining the sudden schedule change, a source at CBS News told Deadline that they determined the CECOT segment 'needed additional reporting.' \n\nThe CBS libs were aghast:\n\nBut an email from [correspondent Sharyn] Alfonsi to other correspondents, including Lesley Stahl, Scott Pelley, and Anderson Cooper, claimed new CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss 'spiked our story,' according to The Wall Street Journal.Alfonsi said she believes the move to pull the piece was a political decision rather than an editorial call. 'Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices. It is factually correct,' Alfonsi wrote in the email. 'In my view, pulling it now, after every rigorous internal check has been met, is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.'\n\nRight: in other words, the Usual Suspects wanted another “illegal criminal aliens are actually saints in disguise” story, but Weiss said “enough of that garbage.” We don’t know for sure that that is exactly what happened, but it sure looks like it. In any case, the story did not run.\n\nTHEY LIE: Veteran '60 Minutes' Producer on the Outs After Disastrous Kamala Interview, Trump Lawsuit\n\nFake News: Trump Drops $10 Billion Lawsuit on the BBC for Manipulating J6 Interview\n\nThe mainstream media — what I would call the corrupt, lying, corporate, DNC operation — refused to cover the human misery that Biden’s open border policy caused. Now, they are increasingly butthurt that people like Bari Weiss are calling them to task, and demanding that they tell the truth, which is that many of the “Maryland fathers” that the Trump administration is repatriating are hardcore criminals, rapists, and predators. There’s no reason for them to remain in this country, despite what the liberal media tells you.\n\nIn honor of A Few Good Men Director Rob Reiner:\n\nChange is hard, and it appears that Bari Weiss is bringing it to the unscrupulous, lying outlet that is CBS News. Cry harder, disgraced journos.

The conservative media watchdog found that the daytime gabfest chatted with 128 liberal guests, including 25 Democratic politicians, but only spoke to a pair of conservatives the entire year. \"Their noticeable lack of right-leaning guests is just like their search for someone to fill the ‘conservative seat’ in the panel.

Obama staffers turned \"Pod Save America\" hosts Jon Favreau, Jon Lovett, and Tommy Vietor were also guests on the show, and Biden press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre appeared twice. \"The View\" also welcomed Sarah Kate Ellis of left-leaning GLAAD and U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. When it came to conservative guests, only actress Cheryl Hines — who is married to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. — and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., appeared on the program. Fondacaro noted that Hines isn’t truly even a conservative. \"While having left-wing politics herself, she was forced to defend her husband’s — and, by extension, the Trump administration’s — policies. Thus, she was counted as right-leaning,\" he wrote when detailing his findings. \"They only had Greene on because she was being a headache for Congressional Republican leadership during the government shutdown. The cast also tried to recruit her to become a Democrat,\" Fondacaro wrote, adding that he doesn’t expect things to change anytime soon.

The timing has raised eyebrows, coming just days after Trump publicly praised CBS's new owners, the Ellison family, at a rally in North Carolina on Friday.What the Delay Could Cost Viewers and TaxpayersInvestigative segments of this kind typically require substantial resources. Industry data suggests that 60 Minutes' overseas reporting, especially in high-security environments requiring specialised access, insurance, and security measures, can cost between $125,000 to $200,000 (£93,000 to £149,300) per segment.With production costs likely exceeding $150,000 (£111,900), the delayed segment represents a significant investment in accountability journalism—aimed at scrutinising how American tax dollars fund Trump's controversial deportation programme.For the CECOT investigation, correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi gained rare access inside the Terrorism Confinement Centre, interviewing deportees who described 'four months of hell' in the maximum-security facility. Such access demands extensive pre-production planning, security arrangements, and on-ground logistics—all of which are now on hold.'Did you think you were going to die there?' Alfonsi asked one deportee.'We thought we were already the living dead,' the deportee replied.CBS News stated the segment was pulled because it 'needed additional reporting'.The Deportation Programme Under the MicroscopeThe shelved report was set to expand on earlier 60 Minutes coverage that revealed troubling findings about the administration's deportation justifications. A previous investigation found that 75% of the 238 men sent to CECOT in March had no criminal record. Only 22% had any criminal history, mostly for non-violent offences such as theft, shoplifting, and trespassing. Three per cent had unclear records.Among those deported was Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Maryland father whose case became a flashpoint after the Trump administration admitted he was wrongfully removed due to an 'administrative error'. Following a Supreme Court order instructing the government to 'facilitate' his return, he was brought back to the US on 6 June 2025.The administration accused the deportees of links to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, yet data suggests the vast majority posed no documented threat.Why This Matters for Your WalletAmerican taxpayers are funding these deportation operations—from transportation and detention costs to diplomatic arrangements with El Salvador's government. When investigations into such expenditure are delayed, public oversight diminishes, raising concerns over transparency.Trump has worked closely with El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele to establish the CECOT programme. He has also floated the idea of expanding it to include 'homegrown criminals', potentially US citizens.'There is no provision under US law that would allow the government to kick citizens out of the country,' said Erin Corcoran, an immigration law expert at the University of Notre Dame.Questions of Editorial IndependenceTrump's complex relationship with 60 Minutes adds another layer. Paramount, CBS's parent company, paid Trump $16M (£11.9) in July 2025 to settle a lawsuit over a 2024 interview with Kamala Harris, which he claimed was unfairly edited.'For those people that think I am close with the new owners of CBS, please understand that 60 Minutes has treated me far worse since the so-called takeover,' Trump wrote on Truth Social last week, even as he publicly praised the network's new leadership.Whether the delay reflects editorial caution, logistical issues, or external pressure remains unclear. What is certain is that a significant investment in accountability journalism—examining how taxpayer funds support controversial deportation policies—has been postponed, with no confirmed broadcast date.For viewers seeking transparency on immigration spending, the wait continues.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/cecot-cbs-60-minutes-delay-linked-trump-deportee-plan-tax-dollars-down-150k-1764682","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1777513/prison.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=457a046ef8050d50ae6246a2bff0c539","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 10:06:28","author":"Jim Manzon","authors":["Jim Manzon"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.277},{"id":388074986,"title":"Would You Sit Next to Trump on a Plane?

The post by user @doctorlundi has amassed 1.4 million views and 2,100 comments since it was shared on December 16. It shows a mock plane seat layout populated with famous figures from politics, music, film, and sports, inviting viewers to imagine their ideal seat choice for the flight. In the chart, President Donald Trump appears to be seated in the back row, positioned two seats away from singer Sabrina Carpenter. One row ahead, former Vice President Kamala Harris is shown in an aisle seat, seated diagonally from Trump. Political commentator Candace Owens appears to be in the aisle seat next to Harris, while Dwayne Johnson, also known as The Rock, is shown one seat away in the same row. View on Threads Other rows feature a mix of celebrities who appear to include Kim Kardashian, Sydney Sweeney, Taylor Swift, Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, Simon Cowell, and rapper 50 Cent, as well as soccer star Lionel Messi. The caption accompanying the post reads: “I want an aisle seat so I have to go with 7 [an empty seat one seat away from Grohl]. But 4 [an empty seat next to Harris] would be a backup.” The viral post comes as a December 2025 national survey from Emerson College Polling found Trump with a 41 percent job approval rating and 50 percent job disapproval, which is “generally consistent with the November national poll.” The poll noted that “the president’s approval and disapproval numbers have flipped since his inaugural survey, from 41 percent disapproving to 41 percent approving, and 49 percent approving to 50 percent disapproving.” 'Once in a Lifetime Opportunity' On Threads, users quickly began debating which seat they would choose and why. Some focused on avoiding interaction altogether. User @viridis.vulpis wrote, “3 [an empty seat one seat away from Harris]—window seat, cuz I'm gonna put my headset on, not interact with anyone and stare at the clouds.” Others were more selective about proximity. “2 [an empty seat next to Carpenter] is the only answer for me cause I prefer to sit on that side of the plane and only like aisle seats,” @teereadsereads commented. User @grant.tintman wrote: “It’s either 1 [an empty seat next to Trump] or 10 [an empty seat between 50 Cent and Kardashian] for me 1 because I love this country and it would be an honor to meet a president. Once in a lifetime opportunity…Or 10 because 50 cent.” Some users imagined the conversations that might unfold midair. “Anyone else thinking the conversation between Candace Owens and the Rock would be hella interesting,” @sydneymarksberry wrote. Music fans gravitated toward other options. “8 [an empty seat next to Swift] I'd talk to Taylor and 50 the whole flight,” said @ts.lovr13. User @_bexorcist wrote: “I’m sitting with Sabrina, we’re drinking cocktails and making the tangerine toddler man’s life hell the entire flight.” Newsweek has contacted the original poster for comment via Threads.

All of the interactions were in English and there is no breakdown of where in Canada participants lived.\n\nThe study found that interacting with the chatbot did prompt some participants to change their voting intention.\n\n\"In Canada, in the pro-Carney condition, it was one in nine who switched, which is a lot of people,\" said Pennycook. \"In the pro-Poilievre condition, where the AI convinced people to vote for Poilievre, it was one in 13 who switched.\n\n\"That's a lot of people who are changing their minds … if you were to target that at the particular right constituents of particular districts or ridings, then you could flip an election.\"\n\nPennycook said one of the reasons AI chatbots can be effective in political persuasion is that they adapt their arguments to each respondent.\n\nThe study also found that the chatbot was more effective in convincing people to change their votes when it was allowed to use facts to do so.\n\n\"The persuasive effect was almost three times larger in the Canadian federal election than the effect observed in the U.S. experiment, but depriving the AI of the ability to use facts and evidence reduced the effect by more than half,\" the authors wrote.\n\nPennycook pointed out that participants in the study took six to eight minutes to interact with the AI chatbot, versus watching a quick ad.\n\nPennycook said the difference between the U.S. and Canadian impact could be linked to the constant political campaigning in the U.S.\n\n\"Americans are inundated with election content non-stop,\" he said. \"And so, it's much harder to switch, to change people's minds.\"\n\nIn its conclusions, the study found that talking with an AI chatbot \"can meaningfully impact voter attitudes\" but said it remains to be seen how effective the technology will be if it is deployed by political campaigns.\n\n\"It seems highly likely that AI-based approaches to persuasion will play an important role in future elections — with potentially profound consequences for democracy,\" wrote the authors. \n\nWhile the Canadian experiment was conducted during the federal election and some ridings were won with only a handful of votes, Pennycook doubts it could have had an impact on any of the results.\n\n\"There's no real way of knowing, but I think it seems unlikely that this study of a thousand some people would change an election,\" he said, pointing out that participants came from across Canada.\n\nWhile Canada has strict guidelines on the use of things like advertising and other tools to persuade voters during the election writ period, Elections Canada says there are few, if any, rules related to the use of AI during an election campaign.

If victorious, Villegas would add to progressive’s power in Washington while simultaneously reducing the number of representatives amenable to bipartisan compromise.\n\nRedistricting aside, CA-22 figures to be a slightly Republican-leaning district, thus Bains may have a real shot at flipping a seat – whereas Villegas likely does not. Boosting Villegas at the expense of Bains may cost Democrats a potentially winnable seat.\n\nOutside of California, the hole Democrats are digging for themselves by letting progressives drive the party is even more apparent. \n\nIn Texas, former Democratic Rep. Colin Allred was “pressured out of a Senate run, to clear the decks for uber-progressive Rep. Jasmine Crockett.”\n\nNever mind that Allred outperformed former Vice President Kamala Harris by 6% in 2024 or that Crockett trails every GOP challenger according to 270toWin. \n\nAlso disregard that Texas hasn’t had a Democratic senator since 1995. For progressives, the point is to make noise, regardless of whether Democrats are putting forward the candidate with the best chance to win.\n\nOf course, in a democracy, whoever gets a majority of the votes in a single state or district is the rightful winner. However, progressive dominance of Democrats’ grassroots organizations means that more often than not, the party is advancing the least electable politicians in a general election.\n\nIn that same vein, progressive dominance ensures that Democrats’ Congressional caucus is populated by far-left ideologues, not the moderate Democrats who are most likely to find common cause with the GOP in bipartisan solutions to the problems we face as a country. \n\nA recent report from center-left group Welcome emphasizes the vulnerability this poses. It cites that seven-in-ten (70%) voters find the Democratic party to be “out of touch” and too focused on progressive issues.\n\nAdditionally, the report states that most voters believe the party does not care enough about securing the border or lowering crime rates – two key issues that significantly contributed to Harris’ 2024 defeat and threaten to reemerge as major vulnerabilities for Democrats, especially in the 2028 presidential election.\n\nPlainly, Welcome’s report should be a deafening alarm to Democrats. \n\nIt makes clear that the voters who decide presidential elections want Democrats to abandon their extreme, progressive ideology in favor of moderate Democrats, with the side effect of reorienting the entire Democratic Party towards the center. \n\nAnd yet, Democrats appear poised to do the opposite. \n\nWhether out of fear of the far-left or unwillingness to confront the most vocal part of their base on issues like DEI, immigration, the economy, and social issues, moderate Democrats are running the risk of ceding the party to the most unelectable major party platform in modern history.\n\nThat being said, some Democrats have already opted to take this centrist approach, including California Governor Gavin Newsom, who seemingly has his eye on a 2028 bid for the Oval Office.\n\nNewsom, one of President Trump’s loudest opponents, has moved to the center in the last few years. \n\nHe’s welcomed conversations with staunch Republicans like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and the late Charlie Kirk, taken a more centrist stance on transgender athletes in sports, and – arguably most importantly – pushed his fellow Democrats to be “more culturally normal” and “less judgmental” earlier this month.\n\nIn bucking progressive orthodoxies, Newsom is attempting to appeal to the national electorate Democrats need to return to the White House, which is much more moderate than the far-left.\n\nRegrettably, as the Welcome report makes clear, the effects of the progressive surge have already begun to eat away at the Democratic brand, making the party seem narrow-minded, less practical, and ineffective at a time when they should be solidifying their platform.\n\nUltimately, if Democrats prove unable to shake off the rise of the progressives, then they will have nobody to blame for their self-sabotage aside from themselves. For the party to be competitive beyond relying on “we’re not Trump,” they will have to find a way to separate themselves from the extremists in their party. \n\nConversely, if Democrats decide to follow the lead of progressives like Mamdani and Ocasio-Cortez, they will have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory and will cost themselves another election.\n\nDouglas Schoen is a longtime Democratic political consultant.","summary":"Ultimately, if Democrats prove unable to shake off the rise of the progressives, then they will have nobody to blame for their self-sabotage aside from themselves.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2025/12/22/schoen-dems-could-snatch-defeat-from-jaws-of-victory/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SUT-Z-Mamdani-AP25325767592712-01.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 08:56:24","author":"Douglas Schoen","authors":["Douglas Schoen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.144},{"id":388077822,"title":"CBS Boss Said Stephen Miller Could Save Shelved ‘60 Minutes’ Report","text":"White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller was offered up as the MAGA-friendly solution to green-lighting a controversial 60 Minutes report that was pulled from the air at the last minute.\n\nBari Weiss, the Trump-curious new editor-in-chief at CBS News, intervened over a contentious story on the Terrorism Confinement Center, the notorious El Salvador megaprison that houses deportees kicked out of the U.S. by President Donald Trump.\n\nWeiss had requested multiple changes to the piece, and CBS issued a statement claiming the segment on the Terrorism Confinement Center—better known as CECOT—would be screened at a later date as it “needed additional reporting.”\n\nThe New York Times reported on Sunday that Weiss had suggested a 60 Minutes interview with Miller, who is also the Homeland Security Adviser, to balance out the piece on CECOT.

That's according to two people with knowledge of events at the network who spoke on condition of anonymity, citing job security.\n\nThe correspondent on the story, Sharyn Alfonsi, condemned the decision in an email to 60 Minutes colleagues on Sunday evening, saying she believed it was \"not an editorial decision, it is a political one.\" (The email was obtained by NPR and other news organizations.)\n\nA press release sent out Friday morning from CBS News' publicity team had promoted the story, promising a look inside CECOT, \"one of El Salvador's harshest prisons.\" The network ran a video promotion which has since been taken down on the air and on social media. The announcement cited \"the brutal and tortuous conditions\" some recently released deportees said they endured there. The release has since been revised.\n\nThe story had undergone repeated formal reviews by senior producers and news executives, as well as people from the legal and standards division, according to the two people at CBS, echoing Alfonsi's account.\n\nAlfonsi wrote that she and her colleagues on the story had sought comments and interviews from the Department of Homeland Security, the White House and the State Department.\n\n\"Government silence is a statement, not a VETO,\" Alfonsi wrote in the email. \"If the administration's refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a 'kill switch'' for any reporting they find inconvenient.\" (Alfonsi did not respond to an emailed request for comment.)\n\nA CBS spokesperson declined comment but noted that the revised programming announcement said the story would air at a later date.\n\nAs a private citizen, Donald Trump sued CBS last year over the editing of 60 Minutes's interview with his opponent in the presidential elections, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.\n\nEarlier this year, the network's news chief and top executive at 60 Minutes resigned as the network explored settlement talks with Trump's legal team.\n\nParamount's previous owners paid Trump $16 million to settle the case, although legal observers almost unanimously agreed he had little chance of prevailing in court. (The settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing.)\n\nThat settlement helped controlling owner Shari Redstone smooth the sale to the Ellison family through a federal anti-trust review.\n\nWeiss's arrival at the network this year under the new ownership of Paramount chief David Ellison has drawn sharp scrutiny.\n\nWeiss created the online publication The Free Press, a compendium of views and news reporting, on the premise that much of the mainstream media is too reflexively liberal. While the site publishes some stories that are critical of President Trump, she has also indicated she believes much news coverage is distorted in opposition to him.\n\nEllison's father, Oracle founder Larry Ellison, is one of the world's richest people. The elder Ellison is also a financial supporter and adviser to the president. Over the summer, David Ellison made promises to the nation's top broadcast regulator that the network would become more hospitable to conservatives as he won federal approval to take over CBS's parent company, Paramount Global, this summer.\n\nWeiss says news organizations such as CBS can earn back the trust of the public by exploring debate between the center-right and center-left rather than polarized extremes. \n\nEven so, Trump has kept the Ellisons guessing as they also seek federal approval - and his blessing - to take over CNN's corporate parent, Warner Bros. Discovery. He blasted the new Paramount owners — though not by name — over a recent episode of 60 Minutes which gave air time to a former ally-turned-critic, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\n\"THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME!\" Trump posted this month on Truth Social. \"Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!\"\n\nWeiss only made her decision known by early Saturday morning - just a day and a half before the broadcast of the fabled newsmagazine, the most storied franchise in television news. Its stories are usually highly produced and can take weeks or months to deliver to air.\n\nCBS announced its decision late Sunday afternoon, two hours before broadcast.\n\nIn an earlier review of the CECOT report, Weiss had objected to the men being called \"Venezuelan migrants\" rather than \"illegal immigrants\" — a term favored by the Trump administration. Many of those sent to the Salvadoran prison were not in this country illegally and had applied for asylum, awaiting a decision on their applications.\n\nWeiss joined CBS News in October when Ellison's Skydance Media acquired the Free Press. Its coverage has been blended into the CBS News website.\n\nThe CBS job represents Weiss' first within television and the network news division is far larger than the Free Press. That said, she remains the editor of the Free Press and recently hosted a highly promoted interview broadcast on CBS with the conservative activist Erika Kirk, the widow of the slain Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk.\n\nWeiss has also announced plans to build on that template with more newsmaker interviews at CBS, including Vice President JD Vance and Maryland Gov. Wes Moore, a Democrat.","summary":"CBS News Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss pulled a 60 Minutes segment on allegations of abuses at an El Salvador detention center where the Trump administration sent hundreds of Venezuelan migrants.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/22/g-s1-103282/cbs-chief-bari-weiss-pulls-60-minutes-story","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/1024x683+0+0/resize/1024x683!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F3f%2F68%2F8d02054c48bda6040cf3e049415e%2Fgettyimages-2194604196.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 06:31:28","author":"David Folkenflik","authors":["David Folkenflik"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.292},{"id":388119572,"title":"CBS shelves ‘60 Minutes’ story on Trump deportees at the last minute: ‘People are threatening to quit,’ staffers say","text":"“60 Minutes” just suffered a severe blow to its credibility. Now one of its own correspondents fears the program is being “dismantled,” and some employees are threatening to quit. The trigger: CBS News suddenly shelved a segment featuring the accounts of Venezuelan men deported by the Trump administration to a notorious maximum-security prison in El Salvador. The correspondent who reported the story, Sharyn Alfonsi, said in an internal memo that “the public will correctly identify this as corporate censorship.” According to Alfonsi and two CBS sources who spoke with CNN on condition of anonymity, the story had been fully fact-checked and legally vetted by the time the network publicized it on Friday afternoon. But CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss weighed in with questions on Saturday morning, the two sources said. Alfonsi said Weiss “spiked the story.” One of the main issues Weiss raised was the lack of a response from the Trump administration to the reporting. According to Alfonsi, “we requested responses to questions and/or interviews with DHS, the White House, and the State Department.” But the administration did not engage, which concerned Weiss. At one point, Weiss suggested that the program try to interview White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, and provided Miller’s number, one of the CBS sources said. Alfonsi argued in her memo that the administration’s strategic silence cannot be allowed to become a “veto” of a critical story. “Their refusal to be interviewed is a tactical maneuver designed to kill the story,” she wrote. “If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient.” Weiss responded in a statement to The New York Times late Sunday night, “My job is to make sure that all stories we publish are the best they can be. Holding stories that aren’t ready for whatever reason—that they lack sufficient context, say, or that they are missing critical voices—happens every day in every newsroom. I look forward to airing this important piece when it’s ready.” Earlier in the day, CBS News said of the decision to hold the segment, “We determined it needed additional reporting.” But Alfonsi disputed that in her memo. “Our story was screened five times and cleared by both CBS attorneys and Standards and Practices,” she wrote. “It is factually correct. In my view, pulling it now—after every rigorous internal check has been met is not an editorial decision, it is a political one.” “60 Minutes” segments are commonly screened several times before air, but five screenings is an unusually high number, the CBS sources said. It is unclear when Weiss first viewed the story. But she has recently become personally involved in “60 Minutes” stories about politics, the CBS sources told CNN. In another recent turn of events, President Trump has been blasting the newsmagazine on Truth Social, sounding disappointed in CBS’s new owners. In late 2024, Trump sued CBS and its parent company, Paramount, then under different ownership, alleging “60 Minutes” deceptively edited a Kamala Harris interview to benefit her campaign. That lawsuit, which legal experts widely viewed to be legally dubious, loomed large over Paramount’s attempt to merge with Skydance Media, a production company led by David Ellison and supported by Ellison’s father, Larry, the Oracle billionaire. The lawsuit became a flashpoint inside CBS News, where journalists worried that both the old and new corporate leaders sought to mollify Trump at the cost of the newsroom’s credibility. Eventually, the outgoing Paramount leadership team agreed to settle Trump’s lawsuit, and the incoming leadership team agreed to several concessions that satisfied the Trump-aligned FCC. David Ellison took control of Paramount, lavished praise on “60 Minutes,” and said he wanted to strengthen CBS News. Then he acquired Weiss’s startup, The Free Press, for $150 million, and installed her as editor-in-chief. Now in charge of both operations, Weiss has faced media industry skepticism about her lack of experience with TV management and traditional reporting. At the end of October, Weiss traveled to Mar-a-Lago when CBS journalist Norah O’Donnell taped a “60 Minutes” sit-down with President Trump. The president praised Weiss during the interview, though not by name, adding, “I don’t know her, but I hear she’s a great person.” Earlier that same month, Trump also said of the Ellisons, “they’re friends of mine. Big — they’re big supporters of mine, and they’ll do the right thing.” Over the past two weeks, however, Trump has lashed out at Ellison, who is currently waging a politically sensitive hostile takeover bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, CNN’s owner. On Dec. 8, he posted a screed against “60 Minutes” for interviewing Marjorie Taylor Greene, and claimed that since Paramount changed hands, the program “has actually gotten WORSE!” He repeated that opinion on Dec. 16, adding, “If they are friends, I’d hate to see my enemies!” The timing of his most recent complaint, on Friday night, coincided with the behind-the-scenes drama at “60 Minutes.” “I love the new owners of CBS,” Trump said at a rally. “Something happens to them, though. ‘60 Minutes’ has treated me worse under the new ownership than… they just keep treating me, they just keep hitting me, it’s crazy.” By then, CBS was already promoting the upcoming story, titled “INSIDE CECOT.” Friday afternoon’s press release said “correspondent Sharyn Alfonsi speaks with some of the now released deportees, who describe the brutal and torturous conditions they endured inside CECOT.” Alfonsi said in her memo, of those interviewees, “These men risked their lives to speak with us. We have a moral and professional obligation to the sources who entrusted us with their stories. Abandoning them now is a betrayal of the most basic tenet of journalism: giving voice to the voiceless.”","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/12/21/media/60-minutes-cecot-bari-weiss-cbs-sharyn-alfonsi","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2230839396.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 04:45:03","author":"Brian Stelter","authors":["Brian Stelter"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.177},{"id":388043864,"title":"When the Churches Go Silent at Christmas","text":"Even in a deeply cynical time, Christmas remains the most joyous holiday of the year for most people, despite the communistic conspiracy against it — the Democratic Party, academia, the legacy news media, and the entertainment media. Because the concept of a Godsent male Savior come to Earth to save Man from sin demolishes their unsacred cows — the State as the supreme judge of morality, truth as a personal interpretation.\n\nThis godless philosophy has destroyed Western Europe. The Christian faith that built its civilization and sustained it through a thousand years of darkness has been abandoned, hollowed. Consequently, the two forces Europe soundly defeated — Islam and Marxism — are now conquering it with little resistance, enabled by the nations’ leaders.\n\nAll over the continent, charming Yuletide traditions are being canceled for fear of Muslim-induced violence. In Germany, for instance, the beloved Christmas markets, the Weihnachtsmärkte, were scrubbed this year. Evil feeds on fear, and removing a spiritual counter to it only hastens its advance.\n\nMany Christmases ago, I took my first weeklong vacation from USA Today to visit a girlfriend, Jenny, in Dijon, France, where she was studying at the Centre International d’Études Françaises. One chilly night, we left her dorm to take a stroll around the town. Bypassing a small vintage church, we heard the most beautiful violin version of Arcangelo Corelli’s Christmas Concerto (Concerto grosso in G minor, Op. 6, No. 8 [1714]) emanating from within. The door was unlocked, and we went inside.\n\nThe pews were empty. But on the stage stood nine young musicians in angelic white — six girls on string instruments, three men on horns, and their conductor — obviously rehearsing for a special event. On this night, however, Jenny and I were the whole audience, and we sat there for maybe an hour, enchanted and enthralled, aware we were enjoying something special.\n\nJenny died of cancer around eight years ago. Her sister Caroline gave me the sad news, adding one tidbit. For many years before she passed, Jenny often brought up that magical night in a little French church as the most wonderful of her life. That made me happy, if now melancholic. For a memory such as Jenny and I enjoyed will be shared by no one else ever again.\n\nOdds are no church in France today would be trumpeting classical Christian music out to the night for fear of the Moors. The church door would be locked, perhaps permanently. That is if it were not now one of the dozen new mosques built this century in Dijon, where only one stood in 1990.\n\nThe Islamists alone did not crush Christmas in Western Europe. They had plenty of help from the secular Left. From people the Muslims would toss off rooftops or veil once they took full power. But only together can they accomplish their great common goal — the elimination of good family-raising society-building Christians who repel their delusions, perversions, and atrocities against babies and children. Christians who point out evil where it lurks, even when protected by its governmental vassals in Britain and Europe.\n\nIt could have happened to this country, and still might. But here there is resistance, mounted by the true believers of an old yet eternal story recorded 2,000 years ago: “And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. (John 1:14). And His glorious Nativity repels all the fantasy and fanaticism shoved on the weak-minded by the leftist-Islamic alliance.\n\nHere, unlike Europe, Christians are winning the War on Christmas, much to the demonic shrieking of the Left. Because we have devout Christian leaders — even though a leftist killed one of the most influential, Charlie Kirk. Progressives scoff when President Trump celebrates “Merry Christmas” over “Happy Holidays.” They mocked the official White House X account photo of Trump beside a Christmas tree with the caption: “We’re saying MERRY CHRISTMAS again!”\n\nBut it sticks in their craw, because it exposes their agenda to devalue this most sacred day as a secularist holiday — or a fake one like Kwanzaa. Kwanzaa was fabricated by an anti-Christian black nationalist, Maulana Karenga, who said, “Jesus was psychotic,” and called Judeo-Christianity “spookism.” Which has not kept prominent Democrats from proclaiming their reverence for the sham Christmas substitute.\n\n“Our Kwanzaa celebrations are one of my favorite childhood memories,” gushed Kamala Harris in 2020. “The whole family would gather around across multiple generations and we’d tell stories and light the candles.” That’s a story all right. Kwanzaa was created in 1966, Harris in 1964, and the Kwanzaa con didn’t catch on till the 1980s.\n\nChristmas doesn’t need phony endorsement to thrive. On its side it has history — confirming Christ’s Baptism and Crucifixion. Music — some of the most beautiful songs ever composed, like Joy to the World (1719), Hark! The Herald Angels Sing (1739), O Come, All Ye Faithful (1744). Literature — Sir Gawain and the Green Knight (Anonymous, late 14th Century), A Christmas Carol (Charles Dickens, 1843), The Gift of the Magi (O. Henry, 1905), The Christmas Spirit (Lou Aguilar, 2020).\n\nTo quote the most famous line from the most famous Christmas story of all time — though it may soon be deemed hate speech in Europe — “God bless us, every one!”\n\nREAD MORE from Lou Aguilar:\n\nHollywood Horror: The Murder of Rob Reiner\n\nTrouble on the Right\n\nHow Are the Mighty Fallen: The End of Europe and Hollywood","url":"https://spectator.org/when-the-churches-go-silent-at-christmas/","image":"https://spectator.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Christmas-market.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 03:19:51","author":"Lou Aguilar","authors":["Lou Aguilar"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.155},{"id":388035450,"title":"CBS News Abruptly Pulls '60 Minutes' Segment About Trump Admin Sending Immigrants To CECOT","text":"CBS News abruptly pulled a heavily-promoted “60 Minutes” segment about Venezuelan immigrants that the Trump administration sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador just hours before it was scheduled to air.\n\n“The broadcast lineup for tonight’s edition of 60 Minutes has been updated.

Rand Paul of Kentucky delivered a blunt warning about the administration’s handling of the Epstein records, echoing concerns raised by Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), who has been relentless on the issue.\n\nMassie forced the release vote and has accused Attorney General Pam Bondi of violating the law by slow-walking and limiting disclosure. \n\nPaul did not dispute the core of that argument.\n\nInstead, he went further, laying out exactly why half-measures on Epstein are political poison.\n\n“I’ve supported transparency on the Epstein files from the beginning,” Paul said.\n\nPaul explained why that approach is doomed to fail.\n\n“And people tend to believe that some rich people got off scot-free in this — in the Epstein case, the Epstein files.”\n\n Despite the Democrats’ attempts to weaponize the release of the files against Trump, the fact remains that the Biden administration sat on the files for four years—a decision that former Vice President Kamala Harris defends—despite endless rhetoric about transparency. Trump returned to office promising real transparency, and even Trump’s allies believe the administration has failed to live up to its promise fully.\n\nPaul made clear that the administration’s fundamental mistake came when officials hyped the release and then appeared to back away once the spotlight intensified.\n\n“I think it’s a big mistake,” Paul said.\n\n“Look, the administration has struggled for months and months with something they initially ginned up and then sort of tried to tamp down.”\n\n Paul warned that partial disclosure guarantees prolonged political fallout.\n\n“So, any evidence or any kind of indication that there’s not a full reveal on this, this will just plague them for months and months more,” he said.\n\nHe’s right. Democrats have been insinuating for months that the Epstein files would somehow incriminate Trump, despite zero evidence. \n\nPaul offered simple advice that should not require a Senate seat to understand.\n\n“What’s going to happen to people if they don’t? That will play out over time. But my suggestion to them is be transparent and release everything the law requires of you.”\n\nWhen Trump signed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, and the documents failed to deliver the left’s long-promised bombshell, Democrats pivoted to conspiracy theories and bureaucratic excuses. For example, Democrats pounced when a photo from the Epstein files was briefly removed from the online cache of Epstein-related material. This led to conspiracy theories that the Department of Justice was trying to protect Trump. \n\nIn an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche discussed the photo and the reason for the redactions in the files.\n\nBlanche explained the removal had “nothing to do with President Trump” and was instead prompted by concerns over victim privacy after officials realized the images contained identifiable women. He stressed that DOJ policy allows victims, their lawyers, or advocacy groups to request that any document or photo identifying them be taken down and reviewed, a process he said explained the temporary disappearance of the materials. \n\n\"Well, you can see in that photo, there’s photographs of women,\" Blanche said. \"And so we learned after releasing that photograph that there were concerns about those, about those women, and the fact that we had put that photo up. So we pulled that photo down.\"\n\nBlanche also noted that numerous photos of Trump with Jeffrey Epstein have long been public, and that Trump himself has acknowledged socializing with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s before cutting ties with him years before Epstein’s 2006 arrest. Given that history, Blanche dismissed as “laughable” the notion that the department would selectively hide a single image to protect the president when “dozens” of similar photos are already in circulation. \n\n.@DAGToddBlanche: \"The absurdity of us pulling down a photo — a single photo — because President Trump was in it is laughable, and the fact that everybody is trying to act like that's the case is a reflection of their true motivation.\" pic.twitter.com/9u7ZjgL4m7\n— Rapid Response 47 (@RapidResponse47) December 21, 2025\n\nDemocrats have failed to produce a promised “smoking gun” linking Trump to Epstein’s crimes despite years of access to the files under the Biden administration, and are now seizing on procedural moves in the document release to sustain conspiracy theories. Nevertheless, if Republicans want to prove they mean what they say, the path forward is obvious. Release everything required by law. Let the facts land where they may. The longer Washington drags its feet, the louder the suspicion grows, and the harder it becomes to argue that this time is different.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/political/rand-paul-calls-partial-release-epstein-files-big-mistake-trump","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-12/fbc2eee8-def0-418b-9348-d1355027.jpg?itok=klSz2Brk","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-22 02:35:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.853},{"id":388101364,"title":"'I promise you victory.' Vance rallies support at AmericaFest event","text":"PHOENIX — Vice President JD Vance said he would pick up conservative activist Charlie Kirk’s mantle on the final day of Turning Point’s sold-out conference in Arizona, a packed event that featured rapper Nicki Minaj and a call-in from President Donald Trump.\n\nThousands of conservatives have gathered at the Phoenix Convention Center in downtown Phoenix for Turning Point’s annual “AmericaFest” conference. Recently endorsed by Kirk’s widow for a possible 2028 presidential run, Vance delivered a campaign-style speech on Dec. 21 to an audience of some 30,000 people.\n\n\"If you miss Charlie Kirk, do you promise to fight what he died for? Do you promise to take the country back from the people who took his life?\" the vice president said. \"My friends, commit to these things and I promise you victory.\"\n\nKirk was the co-founder of Turning Point USA, a massive political group based in Arizona. He was credited with boosting turnout for Trump and Vance during the 2024 election and reached millions through his podcast and viral debate clips online.\n\nHe was assassinated at a Turning Point event on the Utah Valley University campus on Sept. 10. In the wake of his death — and as the decade-long Trump era nears its end in 2028 — the GOP grappled with what the future will look like during the Turning Point conference. \n\nTrump, who headlined \"AmericaFest\" last year, called in to the conference during a speech by his son, Donald Trump Jr. “Nobody did more for me than Charlie, and there's nobody better than Erika,” the president said as Donald Trump Jr. held his phone up to the microphone.\n\nCharlie Kirk shot and killed in Utah: Maps, graphics, video show fatal shooting\n\nVance receives support from Turning Point CEO Erika Kirk\n\nThe final day of \"AmericaFest\" was also a preview of a presidential battle to come, with Vance and Minaj throwing punches at possible Democratic contenders California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nIn his speech, Vance promoted the accomplishments of the Trump administration and slammed Democrats on issues including Christianity, transgender rights, the economy, and free speech. He also seemed to wink at a 2028 campaign.\n\n“We are gonna kick their ass next November,” Vance said, referring to the 2026 midterm elections. “And every year after that.” \n\nTurning Point CEO Erika Kirk has pledged Turning Point’s support for Vance if he runs for president in 2028, saying that it was Charlie Kirk’s plan. She welcomed the vice president on stage, and they shared a hug while pyrotechnics blazed.\n\nCharlie Kirk was an early supporter of Vance’s 2022 Ohio Senate bid and encouraged Trump to select him as a running mate last summer. Charlie Kirk, who introduced Vance at an Arizona rally last year, said, \"I saw something in him that I’ve been looking for in the political landscape.\"\n\nMinaj mistakenly calls Vance an 'assassin'\n\nSurprise guest Minaj took the stage to her hit \"Super Bass,\" where Erika Kirk interviewed her about supporting the Trump administration and her activism on behalf of persecuted Christians in Nigeria. Minaj said she wants her legacy to be that people know \"it’s OK to change your mind.\" \n\nAt one point, Minaj mistakenly referred to Vance as an \"assassin\" while sharing her message for young men. \n\n\"Dear young men, you have amazing role models like our handsome, dashing president and you have amazing role models like the assassin JD Vance, our vice president. And when I say that —\" Minaj paused and covered her mouth. \n\nErika Kirk told her it was OK, while people in the crowd shouted that they understood what Minaj meant. \n\n\"There’s nothing new under the sun that I have not heard, so you’re fine,\" Erika Kirk said. \"If the internet wants to clip it, who cares. I love this woman; she’s an amazing woman.\" \n\nCharlie Kirk death: How online reactions to Charlie Kirk's killing test limits of First Amendment\n\nThe flub came as Candace Owens, a right-wing podcaster and former Turning Point contributor, has spread conspiracy theories about Charlie Kirk’s murder. Owens has claimed without evidence that top Turning Point leaders were involved in his killing.\n\nVance also sought to tamp down on the conspiracies in his remarks, telling the crowd that he researched them to make sense of Charlie Kirk's death but eventually accepted reality.\n\nTyler Robinson, 22, has been charged with Charlie Kirk’s murder and recently made his first in-person court appearance. When Vance addressed Robinson, the crowd booed.\n\n\"He is everything the far left wants from our young men. He rejected the conservatism and the spirituality, the values of a small-town family,\" Vance said. \"He moved into a small apartment. He became addicted to porn. He became addicted to hate and he ended up sleeping with somebody who doesn’t know whether they’re a man or woman.\" \n\nKirk honored at convention \n\nThree months after he was killed, Charlie Kirk was memorialized in nearly every area of the \"AmericaFest\" conference. As attendees descended an escalator to the main hall, they were welcomed by a wall that read “WE ARE ALL CHARLIE KIRK” with a photo of the late Turning Point co-founder. \n\nA timeline of Charlie Kirk’s life covered another wall in the convention center, noting milestones like his marriage to Erika Kirk, the birth of their first child, and the start of his popular \"The Charlie Kirk Show\" podcast. The final date on the timeline was his assassination date, with the words \"LEGACY CEMENTED\" and a photo of Charlie Kirk the day he was killed. \n\nOne of Turning Point’s \"PROVE ME WRONG\" debate tents used at the Utah Valley University event was on display for photos in the exhibition hall. The microphone Charlie Kirk was using when he was shot was displayed on stage in a case. \n\nPodcasters, livestreamers, and TV networks broadcast from booths all around the convention center. Fox News interviewed Utah high schooler Elle Anderson, who says she was the last person to take a selfie with Charlie Kirk before he died. \n\nHunter Kozak, who asked Charlie Kirk the question he was answering when he was shot and killed, sat at a debate table outside the convention center entrance. Kozak is part of the \"Un(expletive) America Tour,\" a liberal group that aims to counter Turning Point events. \n\nInside, countless people wore white T-shirts emblazoned with the word \"FREEDOM,\" replicas of the shirt Charlie Kirk wore when he was shot. More iterations of the T-shirt were on sale at booths inside the convention center and from vendors on the streets.\n\nMixed opinions on Turning Point’s early Vance endorsement \n\nSuzie Neitzke, 57, is “100%” behind Vance for president in 2028. She attended the conference with her husband and teenage daughter from Waukesha, Wisconsin. \n\n“We want him for the next president, and we're on board,” Neitzke said. “We love him as a person. His humor is very close to Trump's. I just think it's great. I think that he is going to do a great job as president. He will make it.” \n\nNeitzke is a longtime Trump supporter. Before Trump entered the presidential race in 2015, Neitzke said she had a Trump sign in her yard that was handmade by her husband. \n\nJudah Westdorp and Ian Westdorp, teenagers from Fort Collins, Colorado, said they would “absolutely” support Vance in three years. \n\n“I love JD Vance, honestly,” Judah Westdorp said. “I like him more than Donald Trump.” \n\nTrump does a great job of connecting with people, he said, but sees Vance as the person who can sustain the conservative movement and continue uniting people.\n\n'Broader chilling effect': College students less comfortable expressing beliefs after Kirk death\n\n“Donald Trump was the businessman and, like, the executive we needed to fix the country. And JD Vance is the leader who can drive this country forward after we get the scale tipped back to normal again,” Ian Westdorp said. \n\nSome Vance fans said they’re keeping their options open because the presidential primaries are still three years away.\n\n“I still kind of think it's too early. I would support the vice president, but it just depends on what other people run and who else is running at that time,” said Bo Miner, an 18-year-old from Bentonville, Arkansas. \n\nMatthew Buchanan, 28, echoed that view. He runs a marketing and consulting company in New Jersey.\n\n“I just believe it's way too early. It's only what, 2025, and the election wouldn't be until 2028,” Buchanan said. “There's so many different things that can happen between now and then. But ultimately, JD Vance has done such a great job with everything that he's done and he speaks so incredibly well,” Buchanan said. \n\nStephanie Murray covers national politics and the Trump administration for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

Instead of pushing for the transparency that they’re always jabbering about, they themselves are choosing to bury their heads in the sand and not let their donors and the public find out how they managed to faceplant in the presidential election despite Kamala Harris blowing through $1.5 billion — all while a friendly mainstream media complex was there to help by trying to convince voters of how smart she was.\n\nRather than learning from their failures, they are instead opting to hide them.\n\nNot everyone inside the party is happy with this move, though, according to reports and social media posts:\n\nDemocrat Party members reportedly are angry that Chairman Ken Martin decided to bury a postmortem of the 2024 election.Democrats commissioned an extensive internal review of what went wrong after their losses last year only to have Martin decide the public, donors, and even many party activists won't get to see it.The backlash is coming from inside the Democrat tent, where strategists and operatives warn that refusing to air the findings reinforces a growing trust problem and all but guarantees the party repeats the mistakes.\n\nREAD MORE: How Bad Is It for Dems? Their Decision on Releasing Their 2024 Autopsy Report Says It All \n\nInsiders are reportedly fuming:\n\nOne insider told The Hill the party has a habit of \"gloss[ing] things over\" and pretending \"nothing to see here,\" adding, \"And that's how we lose elections.\"Another prominent Democrat, strategist Jamal Simmons, argued that volunteers, donors, and voters \"deserve to know what went wrong\" and that the DNC should tell them.That criticism goes to the heart of what conservatives have long argued, that the Democrat Party is increasingly run like a brand-management operation, quick to message and slow to confront reality.\n\nHere’s how a social media user who describes himself as a “Lifelong Dem” reacted:\n\nHiding the 2024 autopsy report isn’t coming across like strategy, it looks like fear of hard truths.So far the lesson we read about from 2024 is “we lost white men,” that’s not analysis, that’s avoidance. Real questions are being buried, how did the free Palestine movement affect votes, coalition fractures, messaging failures, trust. You don’t fix those by suppressing evidence. You fix them by showing your work.\n\nDemocratic candidate for Governor of New Hampshire Jon Kiper says Martin just needs to walk away:\n\nThis is typical Democrat behavior: when things don’t go their way, they try to hide the evidence and avoid accountability. Luckily, we’ll be here to remind them of their blunders at every opportunity.\n\nEditor's Note: America dodged a bullet when Donald Trump beat Kamala Harris at the ballot box.\n\nOne reason why he won is that conservative outlets like RedState kept bringing you the unvarnished truth, and we didn’t try to gaslight you like the mainstream media did.\n\nHelp us continue our mission.
