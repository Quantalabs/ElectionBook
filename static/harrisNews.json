SEN. JOHN FETTERMAN MAKES PREDICTION FOR TRUMP AND HARRIS DEBATE: ‘IT'S GOING TO BE CLOSE’ \"[The Trump campaign] offered her three debates, which is really out of respect for the American people and the voters [for candidates] to earn their vote on Election Day,\" Fox News contributor Katie Pavlich said. \"We've always had three debates, right? One is this format that we're going to see on Tuesday night, one is a town hall debate, and then one focuses on foreign policy,\" Fox News contributor Joe Concha said. \"[Harris] was offered a Fox News debate, and she would not take that debate because Bret Baier [and] Martha MacCallum are going to ask germane, relevant, tough questions. She wants no part of that whatsoever.\" TRUMP SLAMS ABC AHEAD OF PIVOTAL NETWORK-HOSTED DEBATE: 'THEY’RE THE WORST, THEY’RE THE NASTIEST' Following suit behind the first presidential debate between Trump and Biden in July, mics for one candidate will be live at a time as they answer questions, while the other’s microphone will remain muted until it is their turn to speak. ABC News also reported that Trump and Harris will have two minutes to answer each question, followed by another two minutes for rebuttal, and \"an additional minute for a follow-up, clarification, or response.\" Neither contender will be allowed to bring pre-written notes on stage, and there will be no opening statements from either party, and closing statements from each participant will be limited to 120 seconds.HARRIS CAMPAIGN AGREES TO ABC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE RULES WITH SOME 'ASSURANCES:' REPORT \"These are the rules that the Biden-Harris campaign agreed to. And if I'm Donald Trump, I’d nail this over and over again - if you're going to fix all the problems in this country that your administration created, why haven't you done it already,\" Concha continued. \"[They] own this, [Trump is] not the incumbent, [Harris] is the incumbent - that's what Donald Trump should hammer.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"It is patently absurd to let [Harris] get to this point in the process, with no real interviews, with no real questions, no follow-up questions, and I anticipate that they will be very pleased with her performance, no matter what the performance is. And that's a huge advantage that Democrats have over Republicans in this propaganda environment,\" Fox News’ Mollie Hemingway said. The debate will be held at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia this Tuesday, September 10th.","summary":"“The Big Weekend Show&quot; co-hosts discuss the debate rules for this Tuesday between former President Trump and Vice President Harris.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-campaign-already-downplaying-her-performance-before-even-happens","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/trumpkamala2.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 00:45:39","author":"Alba Cuebas-Fantauzzi","authors":["Alba Cuebas-Fantauzzi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.028},{"id":255944774,"title":"DirecTV files complaint against Disney with FCC as impasse enters 2nd week","text":"The impasse between DirecTV and Disney over a new carriage agreement has become more heated as it entered its second week. DirecTV filed a complaint with the Federal Communications Commission on Saturday night accusing Disney of negotiating in bad faith. Disney channels, including ESPN and ABC-owned stations in nine markets, have been off DirecTV since the evening of Sept. 1. That meant DirecTV customers were blacked out from viewing most college football games and the final week of the US Open tennis tournament, including the women’s and men’s finals. DirecTV has 11.3 million subscribers, according to Leichtman Research Group, making it the nation’s third-largest pay TV provider. ABC and ESPN will have the “Monday Night Football” opener between the New York Jets and San Francisco 49ers. ABC will also produce and carry a presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on Tuesday in Philadelphia. ABC-owned stations in Los Angeles; the San Francisco Bay Area; Fresno, California; New York; Chicago; Philadelphia; Houston; and Raleigh, North Carolina, are off DirecTV. Besides all ESPN network channels and ABC-owned stations, Disney-branded channels Freeform, FX and National Geographic channel are dark. DirecTV says in its 10-page complaint that Disney is violating the FCC’s good faith mandates by asking it to waive any legal claims on any anticompetitive actions, including its ongoing packaging and minimum penetration demands. DirecTV has asked Disney for the option to provide consumers with cheaper and skinnier bundles of programming, instead of bigger bundles that carry programming some viewers might not be interested in watching. The complaint states: “Along with these anticompetitive demands, Disney has also insisted that DirecTV agree to a ‘clean slate’ provision and a covenant not to sue, both of which are intended to prevent DirecTV from taking legal action regarding Disney’s anticompetitive demands, which would include filing good faith complaints at the Commission. Not three months ago, however, the Media Bureau made clear that such a demand itself constitutes bad faith.” DirecTV CEO Ray Carpenter said during a conference call with business and media analysts on Tuesday that they would not agree to a new carriage deal with Disney without bundling changes. “We’re not playing a short-term game,” Carpenter said. “We need something that is going to work for the long-term sustainability of our video customers. The resolve is there.” Disney has claimed since the blackout began that mutual release of claims is standard practice after licensing agreements are negotiated and agreed upon by the parties. It has also had one with DirecTV under its past renewals. A Disney spokesperson said: “We continue to negotiate with DirecTV to restore access to our content as quickly as possible. We urge DirecTV to stop creating diversions and instead prioritize their customers by finalizing a deal that would allow their subscribers to watch our strong upcoming lineup of sports, news and entertainment programming, starting with the return of Monday Night Football.” Last year, Disney and Charter Spectrum — the nation’s second-largest cable TV provider — were involved in a nearly 12-day impasse until coming to an agreement hours before the first Monday night NFL game of the season.","summary":"The impasse between DirecTV and Disney over a new carriage agreement has become more heated as it entered its second week.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/08/media/directv-files-complaint-against-disney-with-fcc-as-impasse-enters-2nd-week/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/newspress-collage-ypelawn0y-1725842336862.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1725828010&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/9edUvnkS-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-09 00:40:37","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.126},{"id":255944948,"title":"Joe Biden criticized for taking equivalent of 48 years of vacation in just four years as president – much more than Trump","text":"Saturday, July 13 – Donald Trump is shot during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The Republican frontrunner is hit in the ear but stands up and pumps his fist to the crowd. Shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, 20, is shot dead but the Secret Service is slammed for suspected security blunders. Ex-fire chief Corey Comperatore is killed protecting his family. Sunday, July 14 – President Joe Biden calls on Americans to unite and “cool down” political rhetoric in the wake of Trump’s shooting. The Democrat had faced growing calls since his disastrous performance in June’s CNN debate. Shocking video reveals how close Trump came to being killed after turning his head at the last minute. Monday, July 15 – The Republican National Convention kicks off in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where Trump is formally nominated as the Republican candidate. An emotional-looking Trump makes his first appearance since surviving the shooting wearing a large ear bandage. It quickly becomes a must-have fashion item at the RNC. Ohio Senator JD Vance is named as Trump’s running mate. Previously anti-Trump, Vance at just 39 is an inexperienced choice, but seen as having a connection with ordinary Americans. In an interview, Biden admits it was a “mistake” to talk about putting Trump in “the bullseye” days before the assassination attempt. Tuesday, July 16 – The FBI warns of more potential violence in the wake of Trump’s shooting. Intelligence claims Iran had a separate plot to assassinate Trump, but there is no proven link to Crooks. Biden returns to the campaign trail for the first time since the assassination attempt and insists he isn’t stepping down. Wednesday, July 17 – Joe Biden tests positive for Covid, just days after saying he would drop out of the presidential race if he was diagnosed with a medical condition. It intensifies the calls for him to step aside with Kamala Harris and Gavin Newsom floated as potential replacements. At the RNC, JD Vance makes his first speech since being selected as Trump’s VP pick, to the delight of the MAGA crowd. Thursday, July 18 – Donald Trump addresses the RNC, his first speech since surviving an attempted assassination. He appears slower and more subdued than usual but gives the longest convention acceptance speech in US history. Just before he goes on, former wrestler Hulk Hogan rips his shirt off and tells cheering crowds “Trumpomania” will sweep America. Former First Lady Melania, who has barely been seen on the campaign trail, makes an appearance but does not speak. Barack Obama joins calls for Biden to step aside. Friday, July 19 – President Biden appears to consider resigning, as a source says he is in a “contemplative stage” while isolating with Covid. Video emerges showing Biden appearing to lean into the wrong woman after mistaking her for his wife Jill. Meanwhile, the world’s biggest tech outage sparks travel chaos for Republicans leaving the RNC in Milwaukee. Saturday, July 20 – Donald Trump holds his first campaign rally since the shooting in Butler. He appears in Michigan without his ear bandage. His former doctor Ronny Jackson describes his injuries. He appears in his first interview alongside his running mate Vance. Senior Democrat Nancy Pelosi speaks for the first time since being linked to growing calls for Biden to resign. Meanwhile, Biden’s reelection campaign continues to insist he is running, as a spokesperson slams Trump’s rally remarks as showing he is “focused only on himself.” Sunday, July 21 – Joe Biden announces he isn’t running in November in a shock letter, just hours after insisting he was staying in the race. He is the first incumbent to step down in their first term since 1968. Biden endorses Kamala Harris for president as senior Dems through their support behind the Vice President. The news appears to throw the Republicans off their stride. Biden vows to continue his term until November’s election. Monday, July 22 – Kamala Harris raises a record $81 million in 24 hours as she secures the Democratic candidacy. She also inherits some $91 million in leftover campaign funds from Biden. Harris gives her first speech since Biden stepped out, and speaks to the president on the phone, although he doesn’t appear in person. Under-pressure Secret Service chief Kimberly Cheatle appears on Capitol Hill and faces increasing calls to resign over the shooting of Trump. She admits the Secret Service “failed” on July 13 and resigns the following day.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPRESIDENT Joe Biden has been slammed for his excessive use of vacation&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Joe Biden criticized for taking equivalent of 48 years of vacation in just four years as president – much more than Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/joe-biden-criticized-for-taking-equivalent-of-48-years-of-vacation-in-just-four-years-as-president-much-more-than-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Joe-Biden-slammed-for-taking-48-years-worth-of-vacation.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 00:38:21","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.36},{"id":255944636,"title":"Asia shares dragged by Wall Street dive, bonds bullish","text":"SYDNEY: Asian share markets slid on Monday (Sep 9) after worries about a possible US economic downturn slugged Wall Street while dragging bond yields and commodity prices lower as investors avoided risk assets for safer harbours. Japan's Nikkei bore the brunt of the early selling as a stronger yen pressured exporters, losing 2.4 per cent on top of a near 6 per cent slide last week. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.6 per cent, after losing 2.25 per cent last week. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq futures were both a fraction lower, after Friday's slide. Fed fund futures were little changed as investors wondered whether the mixed US August payrolls report would be enough to tip the Federal Reserve into cutting rates by an outsized 50 basis points when it meets next week. So far, markets imply only a 29 per cent chance of a large cut, in part due to comments from Fed Governor Christopher Waller and New York Fed President John Williams on Friday, though Waller did leave open the option of aggressive easing. \"Our read of the data is that the labour market continues to cool, but we see no sign of the kind of rapid deterioration in conditions that would call for a 50bp rate cut,\" Barclays economist Christian Keller said. \"Importantly, we also see no indication of any appetite for this in Fed communications,\" he added. \"We retain our call for the Fed to begin its cycle with a 25bp cut, followed by two more 25bp at the remaining two meetings this year, and a total of 75bp of cuts next year.\" Investors are considerably more dovish and have priced in 115 basis points of easing by Christmas and another 127 basis points for 2025. Data on August US consumer prices on Wednesday should underline the case for a cut, if not the size, with headline inflation seen slowing to 2.6 per cent from 2.9 per cent. ECB TO EASE Markets are also fully priced for a quarter-point cut from the European Central Bank on Thursday, but are less sure on whether it will ease in both October and December. \"What matters will be guidance beyond September, where there's strong pressure on both sides,\" analysts at TD Securities noted in a note. \"Wage growth and services inflation remain strong, emboldening the hawks, while growth indicators are flagging softer, emboldening the doves,\" they added. \"Quarterly cuts are likely more consistent with the new projections.\" The prospect of global policy easing boosted bonds, with 10-year Treasury yields hitting 15-month lows and two-year yields the lowest since March 2023. The 10-year was last at 3.734 per cent and the two at 3.661 per cent, leaving the curve near its steepest since mid-2022. The drop in yields encouraged a further unwinding of yen carry trades which saw the dollar sink as deep as 141.75 yen on Friday before steadying at 142.41 early on Monday. The euro held at US$1.1090, having briefly been as high as US$1.1155 on Friday. Data on consumer prices (CPI) from China due later Monday are expected to show the Asian giant remains a force for disinflation, with producer prices seen falling an annual 1.4 per cent in August. The CPI is forecast to edge up to 0.7 per cent for the year, from 0.5 per cent, mainly due to rising food prices. Figures on China's trade account due Tuesday are expected to show a slowdown in both export and import growth. Also on Tuesday, Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump debate for the first time ahead of the presidential election on Nov 5. In commodity markets, the slide in bond yields kept gold restrained at US$2,496 an ounce and short of its recent all-time top of US$2.531. Oil prices found some support after suffering their biggest weekly fall in 11 months last week amid persistent concerns about global demand. Brent added 57 cents to US$71.63 a barrel, while US crude firmed 60 cents to US$68.27 per barrel.","summary":"","url":"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/business/asia-shares-dragged-wall-street-dive-bonds-bullish-4594986","image":"https://onecms-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--cTfA3xOp--/fl_relative,g_south_east,l_mediacorp:cna:watermark:2024-04:reuters_1,w_0.1/f_auto,q_auto/c_fill,g_auto,h_338,w_600/v1/one-cms/core/2024-09-09t002509z_1_lynxmpek88008_rtroptp_3_global-markets.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 00:35:36","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":255944714,"title":"Tim Walz Lays Into JD Vance Over ‘Fact of Life’ Shooting Comments","text":"Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz took his Republican rival to task over his controversial response in the aftermath of the Georgia school shooting.

Jeb Bush. “I’m here to tell you don’t lose hope. On a personal note, I can tell you that I am as hopeful as ever,” Guilfoyle said. “Because Americans from all walks of life have had enough of the Democrats’ decline. And we are ready, we are willing, and we are able to spark a new era of American exceptionalism.” “And you can clap for that,” Guilfoyle added after pausing briefly for applause that didn’t seem to commence. Guilfoyle’s speech took place at a Florida Republican Party “victory dinner” at the Seminole Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida on Saturday, where GOP leaders celebrated their “million voter advantage over the Democrats.” Florida, once thought of as a swing state that could decide the outcome of elections, has drifted to the right for years. Former President Donald Trump won the state by more than three percentage points in 2020, and is ahead of Democratic nominee Vice President Kamala Harris in most polls. Roughly 700 Republicans were in attendance, according to the Palm Beach Post. Despite their loyalty to the party, Guilfoyle seemed to have a hard time connecting with the audience of GOP loyalists. Even attacks against the Democratic nominee were met with apathy. “I have known her for 25 years. And let me tell you something—do whatever it takes to keep her out of the White House,” Guilfoyle said, pausing for muted applause. Guilfoyle, a native Californian, was previously married to the Golden State’s current Gov. Gavin Newsom until 2006. Harris was a fixture in California politics for over a decade before her election to the Senate in 2017, previously serving as the San Francisco District Attorney and the state’s Attorney General. The lackluster response to Guilfoyle’s speech seemed to rhyme with another poor performance from a Florida Republican—former Gov. Jeb Bush’s notorious “please clap” moment before a bored audience in Iowa during his failed presidential campaign in 2016. Some parts of Guilfoyle’s speech did strike a chord with the conservative audience. “We will achieve not just American energy independence, but complete and total American energy dominance,” Guilfoyle said adamantly, repeating a Trump campaign platform that went over a bit better with the crowd. Guilfoyle’s speech began later in the lineup, potentially explaining the lackluster reception. She followed speeches from Sen. Rick Scott, Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody, Florida Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Byron Donalds. Guilfoyle still received cheers and some standing ovations from the crowd seated closest to the stage as she wrapped up, proclaiming “God bless the United States of America, she’s worth fighting for.” But the crowd became noticeably more animated for the next speaker immediately after Guilfoyle—current Gov. Ron DeSantis. “Are you glad to be in the free state of Florida?” the governor asked, and was answered with rapturous applause from his state party.","summary":"Anadolu/Getty ImagesKimberly Guilfoyle, a conservative activist, former prosecutor, and the fiancée to Donald Trump Jr., had to ask an audience of Republican loyalists for applause on Saturday night, in a moment that recalled an infamous blunder from former Florida Gov.

Their unhappiness with Harris, which started with disappointment and evolved into something stronger, spilled into media reports and the general political conversation. There was broad agreement that Harris had just not been a very good pick for the nation’s second-highest position. In February 2023, the New York Times published an article titled, “Kamala Harris Is Trying to Define Her Vice Presidency. Even Her Allies Are Tired of Waiting.” The headline was generous, given what followed. “The painful reality for Ms. Harris is that in private conversations over the last few months, dozens of Democrats in the White House, on Capitol Hill, and around the nation … said [Harris] had not risen to the challenge of proving herself as a future leader of the party, much less the country,” the New York Times reported. “Even some Democrats whom her own advisers referred reporters to for supportive quotes confided privately that they had lost hope in her.” The New York Times went on to note that Harris’s vice presidency is notable largely because of her race and gender, as opposed to her accomplishments in office. “She has already made history as the first woman, the first African American and the first Asian American ever to serve as vice president,” the paper said, “but she has still struggled to define her role much beyond that legacy.” Given all that, the New York Times reported that “a quiet panic” had “set in among key Democrats about what would happen if President Biden opted not to run for a second term.” Harris made the situation even worse by retreating to “a bunker” for about a year, the New York Times said, “after her disastrous interview with Lester Holt of NBC News.” In November 2021, three months before the New York Times published the “lost hope” piece, CNN published “Exasperation and dysfunction: Inside Kamala Harris’ frustrating start as vice president.” CNN reported that “key West Wing aides” — meaning people close to Biden — were “worn out by what they see as entrenched dysfunction and lack of focus” from Harris. The aides, CNN continued, “have largely thrown up their hands at [Harris] and her staff — deciding there simply isn’t time to deal with them right now.” In June 2021, Politico published a story headlined, “‘Not a healthy environment’: Kamala Harris’ office rife with dissent.” The vice president’s office, the article reported, was an angry and chaotic place. Some blamed her top aides, but other Biden administration officials blamed Harris herself. “People are thrown under the bus from the very top, there are short fuses, and it’s an abusive environment,” said one person “with direct knowledge of how Harris’s office is run.” The person continued: “It’s not a healthy environment and people often feel mistreated. It’s not a place where people feel supported but a place where people feel treated like s***.” Those are just a few examples, but there were many more, all of which could be summarized by one, brief sentence: Kamala Harris made a mess of the vice presidency. People got the idea. Harris came into office with a net favorable rating, according to the RealClearPolitics average of polls. By June 2021, less than six months in, Harris had turned that into an unfavorable rating. That rating stayed in the unfavorable range until this June. On the eve of Biden’s withdrawal from the race, Harris had a 53.8% unfavorable rating and a 38.4% favorable rating. Polls that specifically measured her job approval, as opposed to personal favorability or unfavorability, found about the same thing. Harris was unpopular, and voters did not approve of the job she was doing. All this seems surreal in light of the last few weeks. Press coverage, some of it openly adulatory, has mostly memory-holed the deficiencies of Harris as vice president. With the exception of a 27-minute Q&A with CNN, Harris has largely ignored journalists and their questions. Even if reporters were determined to grill her on her record, they haven’t had the chance and might not get the chance anytime soon. Harris’s personal favorability rating has shot up in the absence of discussion about what she did and did not do as vice president. It’s a bad situation. Despite all that, though, there are still nearly 60 days before the election, although early and mail-in voting begin soon. There is still time for the system to work as it should, even in a drastically shortened campaign, and give Harris’s time in office the scrutiny it deserves.","summary":"REMEMBER WHEN DEMOCRATS (AND EVERYBODY ELSE) THOUGHT KAMALA HARRIS WAS A BAD VICE PRESIDENT? In the weeks since a group of secretive Democratic powerbrokers pushed President Joe Biden out of the race, the party as a whole has embraced Vice President Kamala Harris with astonishing speed.

Walz took to stage to highlight his support for his running mate, Kamala Harris (“Yes, by the way, she’s more qualified than anybody that’s ever run for this office, let’s be clear”) along with the pair’s record on queer rights. “I’m an old, straight, white guy, I’m teaching social studies, you’re all picturing the damn stereotype here. Turns out I’m opposite world of Tommy Tuberville though,” he said before describing his involvement with his former school’s gay-straight alliance. Yet the Minnesota governor used the opportunity to namecheck more than just Tuberville. “It’s a fact of life some people are gay,” Walz said. “But you know what’s not a fact of life? That our children need to be shot dead in schools. That’s not a fact of life.” Vance told a crowd during a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, last week, that increased security was the answer to school shootings, rather than tougher legislation on guns. Four people were killed and another nine injured last week after 14-year-old Colt Gray allegedly launched an attack on Apalachee High School in Georgia. “I don’t like that this is a fact of life. But if you’re—if you are a psycho, you want to make headlines, you realize that our schools are soft targets. And we have got to bolster security at our schools… We’ve got to bolster security so if a psycho wants to walk through the front door and kill a bunch of children, they’re not able to,” Vance said. “If these psychos are going to go after our kids we’ve got to be prepared for it,” Vance said. “We don’t have to like the reality that we live in, but it is the reality we live in. We’ve got to deal with it.” While the Harris-Walz campaign had already condemned Vance’s comments, Walz used his speech to reiterate, “Folks are banning books, but they’re okay with weapons of war being in our schools. Look, that’s not this country, it doesn’t have to be this way, it doesn’t happen elsewhere, we’re going to make sure our children are seen, they bring their authentic selves, then we’re going to make sure they’re safe when they get there, so thank you all,” he said. Republicans however have supported Vance over his comments, claiming the criticism is driven by Democrats with an agenda.","summary":"Kevin Lamarque/ReutersDemocratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz took his Republican rival to task over his controversial response in the aftermath of the Georgia school shooting.\n\nWalz made a speech during an appearance at the Humans Rights Campaign National Dinner–the nation’s largest LGBTQ+ civil rights organization–in Washington on Saturday night.\n\nWalz took to stage to highlight his support for his running mate, Kamala Harris (“Yes, by the way, she’s more qualified than anybody that’s ever run for this office, let’s be clear”) along with the pair’s record on queer rights.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/tim-walz-lays-into-jd-vance-over-fact-of-life-shooting-comments","image":"https://img.thedailybeast.com/image/upload/c_crop,d_placeholder_euli9k,h_2781,w_4944,x_0,y_171/dpr_2.0/c_limit,w_740/fl_lossy,q_auto/v1725839291/2024-09-07T233207Z_113840846_RC2ZV9AN7L6Y_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-WALZ_t3s1gu","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-09 00:10:53","author":"Matt Young","authors":["Matt Young"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.116},{"id":255943606,"title":"Republicans in the House publish a biased report holding Biden responsible for the chaotic conclusion of the US military presence in Afghanistan.","text":"WASHINGTON – House Republicans on Sunday issued a scathing report on their investigation into the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, blaming the disastrous end of America’s longest war on President Joe Biden’s administration and minimizing the role of former President Donald Trump, who had signed the withdrawal deal with the Taliban. The partisan review lays out the final months of military and civilian failures, following Trump’s February 2020 withdrawal deal, that allowed America’s fundamentalist Taliban enemy to sweep through and conquer all of the country even before the last U.S. officials flew out on Aug. 30, 2021. The chaotic exit left behind many American citizens, Afghan battlefield allies, women activists and others at risk from the Taliban. But House Republicans’ report breaks little new ground as the withdrawal has been exhaustively litigated through several independent reviews. Previous investigations and analyses have pointed to a systemic failure spanning the last four presidential administrations and concluded that Biden and Trump share the heaviest blame. Texas Republican Rep. Michael McCaul, who led the investigation as chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said the GOP review reveals that the Biden administration “had the information and opportunity to take necessary steps to plan for the inevitable collapse of the Afghan government, so we could safely evacuate U.S. personnel, American citizens, green card holders, and our brave Afghan allies.” “At each step of the way, however, the administration picked optics over security,” he said in a statement. McCaul earlier in the day denied that the timing of the report’s release ahead of the presidential election was political, or that Republicans ignored Trump’s mistakes in the U.S. withdrawal. Defending the administration after release of the report, a State Department spokesman said that Biden acted in the U.S.’s best interest in finally ending the country’s deployment in Afghanistan. The spokesman, Matthew Miller, said in a statement that Republicans produced a narrative “meant only to harm the Administration, instead of seeking to actually inform Americans on how our longest war came to an end.” House Democrats in a statement said the report by their Republican colleagues “cherry-picked witness testimony to exclude anything unhelpful to a predetermined, partisan narrative about the Afghanistan withdrawal” and ignored facts about Trump’s role. The more than 18-month investigation by Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee zeroed in on the months leading up to the removal of U.S. troops, saying that Biden and his administration undermined high-ranking officials and ignored warnings as the Taliban seized key cities far faster than most U.S. officials had expected or prepared for. “I called their advance ‘the Red Blob,’” retired Col. Seth Krummrich said of the Taliban, telling the committee that at the special operations’ central command where he was chief of staff, ”we tracked the Taliban advance daily, looking like a red blob gobbling up terrain.” “I don’t think we ever thought — you know, nobody ever talked about, ‘Well, what’s going to happen when the Taliban come over the wall?”’ Carol Perez, the State Department’s acting undersecretary for management at the time of the withdrawal, said of what House Republicans said was minimal State Department planning before abandoning the embassy in mid-August 2021 when the Taliban swept into Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital. The withdrawal ended a nearly two-decade occupation by U.S. and allied forces begun to rout out the al-Qaida militants responsible for the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States. The Taliban had allowed al-Qaida’s leader, Osama bin Laden, to shelter in Afghanistan. Committee staffers noted reports since the U.S. withdrawal of the group rebuilding in Afghanistan, such as a U.N. report of up to eight al-Qaida training camps there. The Taliban overthrew an Afghan government and military that the U.S. had spent nearly 20 years and trillions of dollars building in hopes of keeping the country from again becoming a base for anti-Western extremists. A 2023 report by the U.S. government watchdog for the U.S. in Afghanistan singles out Trump’s February 2020 deal with the Taliban agreeing to withdraw all American forces and military contractors by the spring of the next year, and both Trump’s and Biden’s determination to keep pulling out U.S. forces despite the Taliban breaking key commitments in the withdrawal deal. House Republicans’ more than 350-page document is the product of hours of testimony — including with former Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley, U.S. Central Command retired Gen. Frank McKenzie and others who were senior officials at the time — seven public hearings and round-tables as well as more than 20,000 pages of State Department documents reviewed by the committees. With Biden no longer running for reelection, Trump and his GOP allies have tried to elevate the withdrawal as a campaign issue against Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now Trump’s Democratic opponent in the presidential race. The report by House Republican cites Harris’ overall responsibility as an adviser to Biden, but doesn’t point to specific counsel or action by Harris that contributed to the many failures. Some highlights of the report: Decision to withdraw Republicans point to testimony and records that claim the Biden administration’s reliance on input from military and civilian leaders on the ground in Afghanistan in the months before the withdrawal was “severely limited,” with most of the decision-making taking place by National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan without consultation with key stakeholders. The report says Biden proceeded with the withdrawal even though the Taliban was failing to keep some of its agreements under the deal, including breaking its promise to enter talks with the then-U.S.- backed Afghan government. Former State Department spokesperson Ned Price testified to the committee that adherence to the Doha Agreement was “immaterial” to Biden’s decision to withdraw, according to the report. Earlier reviews have said Trump also carried out his early steps of the withdrawal deal, cutting the U.S. troop presence from about 13,000 to an eventual 2,500 despite early Taliban noncompliance with some parts of the deal, and despite the Taliban escalating attacks on Afghan forces. The House report faults a longtime U.S. diplomat for Afghanistan, former Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, not Trump, for Trump administration actions in its negotiations with the Taliban. The new report says that Trump was following recommendations of American military leaders in making sharp cuts in U.S. troop numbers in Afghanistan after the signing. ‘We were still in planning’ when Kabul fell McKenzie, who was one of the two U.S. generals who oversaw the evacuation, told lawmakers that the administration’s insistence at keeping the embassy open and fully operational was the “fatal flaw that created what happened in August,” according to the report. The committee report claims that State Department officials went as far as watering down or “even completely rewriting reports” from heads of diplomatic security and the Department of Defense that had warned of the threats to U.S. personnel as the withdrawal date got closer. “We were still in planning” when Kabul fell, Perez, the senior U.S. diplomat, testified to the committee. ___ Associated Press writer Rebecca Santana contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – House Republicans on Sunday issued a scathing report on their&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Republicans in the House publish a biased report holding Biden responsible for the chaotic conclusion of the US military presence in Afghanistan. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/republicans-in-the-house-publish-a-biased-report-holding-biden-responsible-for-the-chaotic-conclusion-of-the-us-military-presence-in-afghanistan/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-House-Republicans-release-partisan-report-blaming-Biden.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 23:55:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.199},{"id":255944128,"title":"Letters to the Editor, Sept. 9, 2024","text":"BACK TO WORK Pierre Poilievre thinks the civil service is too large.

For example, the memo says \"Donald Trump and House Republicans are attacking Americans' freedoms — rolling back reproductive freedoms, banning books in schools, and dictating to people who they are allowed to love or how they can or cannot build a family. These far-right extremists are hellbent on restricting rights and taking away Americans' freedoms.\"The final months of the race for control of the House have featured campaign advertisements, mailings and speeches focused on a variety of wedge issues, including consumer prices, border security, gun control and public safety. The Democratic campaign memo includes a broader argument that concept of \"freedoms\" can be utilized to encompass several pressing issues that are important voters, including women's reproductive rights, the controversial Project 2025 to overhaul the executive branch, the ongoing criticisms of Trump's defense of Jan. 6 Capitol rioters and his baseless claims of 2020 election fraud.\"Across the battlefield, DCCC candidates and 'frontliners' are engaging the issue and working diligently to ensure voters know that electing House Democrats means codifying the protections of Roe, fighting for families and investing in their economic freedom, and standing up to Donald Trump and House Republicans' plans to attack their freedoms,\" the memo says. \"This strong contrast messaging is essential to help Democrats reclaim the House majority to defend our rights, freedoms, democracy, and future.\"Speaking with CBS News between campaign stops in Nebraska, Democratic Congressional candidate Tony Vargas invoked some of his party's messaging on freedom issues.\"This is a Republican party that wants to take away — and tell you — what you can learn,\" Vargas said. \"They want to tell you what you can and cannot do with your body.

That was the one of the main takeaways from the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s more than two-year investigation into America’s chaotic, deadly Afghanistan withdrawal, according to a blistering report released Sunday. “During his decades-long tenure as a Delaware US senator, eight years as vice president of the United States and nearly four years as president, Mr. Biden has demonstrated distrust of America’s military experts and advisors and has prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America’s national security interests,” the roughly 350-page report asserted. His administration consistently lied to and misled the American public to try to convince them to support his consequences-be-damned view that the US should swiftly end it’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, the review said. Former President Donald Trump’s administration had previously created and entered into the Doha Agreement with the Afghan government and the Taliban to end the US war in Afghanistan. But Biden forged ahead with little deference to the terms of the agreement — no matter the cost — though he would later blame the same document for forcing his hand, the report found. The Doha Agreement, formed in 2020, held that the US would withdraw its troops from Afghanistan if the Taliban met certain obligations. For example, the terrorist group was responsible for “cutting ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, ceasing attacks on US and coalition troops, reducing violence against Afghan forces and starting negotiations with the Afghan government,” according to the report. But Biden’s reckless, blind determination pushed aside the agreement’s critical details, the document said. All for show On Feb. 4, 2021, then-State Department spokesman Ned Price announced that the US would begin the review to assess the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement to evaluate whether the US should imminently withdraw from Afghanistan. But “in his testimony before the committee, contrary to his public statement, Mr. Price asserted the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement was in fact ‘immaterial’ to the Biden-Harris administration’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan,” the document found. The administration’s “lies” and “misrepresentations” only continued, the report said. “Missing from press releases was information related to the Taliban’s failure to adhere to the Doha Agreement, the ongoing presence of terrorism in Afghanistan, the capabilities of the Afghan government and military with and without U.S. support, and dissent from NATO allies on the US plan to withdraw,” according to the report. “The Taliban were in breach of key elements of the Doha Agreement, [though] the Biden-Harris administration claimed to be assessing the Taliban’s compliance therewith,” the report said. “In reality, the conditions were entirely irrelevant to them.” Advice ignored Biden made the decision to pull out entirely despite nearly every military official advising against it, the document said. “Despite President Biden’s public assertions to the contrary, our investigation has revealed the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the commander of US Central Command, the secretary of state, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the commander of NATO’s Resolute Support Mission and United States Forces-Afghanistan all advised against withdrawing all US troops from the country — both during and after the interagency review,” the report said. The Harris-Biden administration also ignored the international community’s concerns, barreling past the objections of other NATO nations that deployed to Afghanistan in support of the US. Even key figures in Afghanistan had pleaded against a total US withdrawal, arguing the landlocked nation simply needed more time to prepare. “General Haibatullah Alizai — former Afghan Army general — informed the committee majority staff that he pleaded for more time from American commanders on the ground, saying, ‘Just tell your leadership to stay with us for two more years. … We’re going to take the initiative … it’s in our favor and we can defeat the Taliban,’ ” the report recounted. Failure to plan Across the board, the report painted a picture of an administration that was heavily fixated on the political optics of the withdrawal while lacking the foresight to plan ahead, even for predictable scenarios. In one striking passage, the report underscored that Biden didn’t officially order a noncombatant evacuation operation — the largest the US had ever pursued in history — until Aug. 16, 2021, a day after Kabul fell to the Taliban and just two weeks before the last US troops left the city. “The failure to prepare for a NEO had ramifications not only for Americans and allies in Afghanistan, but US personnel on the ground forced to evacuate desperate civilians in a hostile environment,” the report said. “Those concerns were sidelined by the Biden-Harris administration in favor of optics. “Rather than concede their negligence, US service members and foreign service officers were directed to prioritize evacuating as many people as possible, no matter the threat posed to their lives.” Implications for Kamala Vice President Kamala Harris was sparingly mentioned in the report, which was one factor that former committee senior investigator Jerry Dunleavy cited in his protest resignation from the probe. “Harris was the last person in the room when President Biden made the decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan; a fact she boasted shortly after President Biden issued his go-to-zero order,” the report stressed, pointing to previous public reporting. She was one of 15 administration officials that the report recommended Congress pass a resolution condemning over the debacle. The report’s release comes just two days before Harris’ televised debate against Trump in Philadelphia.Critics such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have accused the panel of timing the report’s release for political purposes. But the panel’s chairman, Michael McCaul (R-Texas), fired back to CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “It’s taken me two years to get to this point because of the obstruction — I’ve had to serve subpoena after subpoena.’’ McCaul did fault Trump for one key aspect of the withdrawal — the omission of the Afghan government from negotiations over the Doha Agreement, which occurred under his watch. Fallout Despite the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s decision to release its sprawling report on the Afghanistan withdrawal, its work on the matter is far from over. “We have a lot of unanswered questions regarding the [Department of Defense] … [about] what happened on the ground,” McCaul said. The panel, which conducted 18 transcribed interviews, poured through over 20,000 pages worth of documents and held seven public hearings to produce the scathing report, is also eyeing reforms for the National Security Council and State Department. “Everything we have seen and heard of Chairman McCaul’s latest partisan report shows that it is based on cherry-picked facts, inaccurate characterizations, and pre-existing biases that have plagued this investigation from the start,” said Sharon Yang, a rep for oversight and investigations at the White House.","summary":"WASHINGTON — President Biden was so hellbent on getting out of Afghanistan that he rebuked any advice to the contrary, ignored the pleas of the Afghan government and disregarded objections from US allies.

De Niro kicked off the event — hosted by comedian Paul Mecurio, former New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Providence, R.I., Mayor Joseph Paolino Jr. — by saying he’s hopeful that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz will win the 2024 presidential election but warned that their supporters should not get complacent. “I’m very optimistic about it all,” he said. “I’m very excited, but to me, it ain’t over till it’s over. So we can’t for one second think that we’re ahead of this thing. We just have to be on it all the time until the very end because they’re going to try everything when the election day comes. When will these things be final? What will they question? What will they play games about? We know it’s coming, we see it coming. We have to just be ever vigilant, and it’s not over till it’s over.” De Niro also said he hopes that, if the Democratic ticket of Harris and Walz beats the Republican ticket of Donald Trump and JD Vance, that there won’t be a repeat of the January 6 Capitol riot. “Hopefully, if God willing that it’s Kamala and Walz, that the ones who make the big thing and what happened [on] January 6, I think people will think twice about doing something about that no matter what Trump says, because … people pay a price, and is it worth it for them? Especially following someone like him? You know, it’s just insane.” De Niro added that he hopes some Trump supporters will see something in the Harris-Walz ticket that speaks to them. “I think people who would normally support Trump … could very well see that that there is a way with them that’s more for them than with Trump because Trump doesn’t offer anything,” he added. “And we’ve seen this before in other countries and other societies and other times in history, they think they can control someone like him. But once he becomes the boss … if God forbid, he becomes the boss, all the people who thought they could control him, they’re gonna find out differently.” Steve Buscemi also spoke during the event, calling Harris “smart, strong, kind, tough, inclusive [and] uniquely qualified.” “There’s, there’s so many issues and policies at stake: affordable health care education, meaningful green initiatives, enacting sensible gun laws,” he said. “I don’t understand why we are banning books and not automatic weapons. And of course a woman’s right to choose so important and respecting people’s choices to not have kids. Everyone has a stake in our future. Sorry JD.” Buscemi also shared his concerns about a second Trump presidency. “We know that there’s no perfect candidates or politicians or presidents and we’re not always going to agree with every policy and decision, foreign or domestic, and that’s OK,” he added. “We still have free speech in this country and the right to peacefully protest, and voting is a right that we should never take for granted. And of course, what worries me about another Trump administration is that … he’s a my-way-or-the-highway type of guy.

Republicans were racing against the political clock to release their report before the next Congress, which polling shows could be either party’s game. Though Biden is no longer the Democratic presidential nominee, the report does seek to tie Harris to the decisions of the commander-in-chief, and Foreign Affairs committee staff noted they couldn’t find any evidence that she disagreed with his decisions. The GOP Foreign Affairs Committee staff told reporters that because the Biden administration has referred to itself as the “Biden-Harris” administration, the committee decided to call the administration as such in their report. The committee held seven public hearings for their investigation into the withdrawal, as well as conducted 18 transcribed interviews with members of the Biden-Harris administration and military officials in charge of overseeing the withdrawal. The committee noted in its report that it analyzed over 20,000 pages of documents provided by the State Department. McCaul said in a statement that he would have preferred for the report to be released “earlier than today” and blamed congressional Democrats for providing “political cover” for the Biden-Harris administration. “Anyone who reads this report will be able to see that we conducted this investigation with integrity, not drawing conclusion ahead of time but rather looking at the facts and evidence we collected,” McCaul said. “The report is simply a recitation of those facts and evidence. This is not about politics to me — it never has been. It’s about getting to the bottom of what happened so we can make sure it never happens again. And it’s about finding who was responsible for this catastrophe so they can finally, after three long years, be held accountable.” Doha Agreement was “immaterial” to Biden’s decision to withdraw The committee found that Biden was determined to withdraw from Afghanistan “no matter the cost” and ignored the Doha Agreement, a conditions-based deal struck between the Taliban and the administration under former President Donald Trump in February 2020. Under the agreement, the U.S. would withdraw troops from the country if the Taliban met certain obligations, such as cutting ties with al Qaeda, ceasing attacks on U.S. troops, reducing violence against Afghan forces, and starting negotiations with the Afghan government. By late 2020, it was evident that the Taliban was violating the terms of the agreement, forcing Trump to keep 2,500 troops in the country until he left office in January 2021. Because the Doha Agreement had been violated, the House Foreign Affairs Committee Republicans said in a call with reporters ahead of the report’s release that Biden could have maintained the Doha Agreement and kept U.S. troops in Afghanistan. Instead, he initiated a “go to zero” withdrawal with no plans to mitigate any fallout, the committee determined. The majority said even the Afghan government asked the Biden-Harris administration to tear up the Doha Agreement, but documents reviewed by the committee found that the president was determined to leave no matter what. Col. Seth Krummrich, chief of staff for Special Operations Command (SOCOM), told the committee in an interview that military advisers told Biden that if the U.S. withdraws, “the Taliban are going to come pouring in and there’s nothing that’s going to stop them.” Documents showed Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin also called on Biden to keep between 2,500 and 4,500 U.S. forces in Afghanistan. “The president decided we’re gonna leave, and he’s not listening to anybody,” Krummrich said. Ned Price, then-spokesperson for the State Department, admitted in testimony to the committee that the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement was “immaterial” to the administration’s decision to withdraw. Biden-Harris administration prioritized optics over U.S. troop and employee security The committee stressed throughout its report that the Biden-Harris administration was worried primarily over the optics of the withdrawal rather than protecting U.S. troops and embassy employees. Documents, interviews, and communications reviewed found that the administration did not prepare for worst-case scenarios, which the GOP said negates the claim the administration didn’t want to alert the Afghan government the U.S. was leaving. The committee noted there were conflicting reports on whether Afghan military officials were aware that Americans were pulling out of the Bagram air base. General Mir Asadullah Kohistani, who took over command of Bagram for the Afghan military, said he heard a “rumor” about the departure, and then “by seven o’clock in the morning, we understood that it was confirmed they had already left Bagram.” His account was confirmed by another Bagram official, arguing the departure was done “without proper coordination with local Afghan officials.” Gen. Frank McKenzie, who oversaw the withdrawal, disputed these claims to the committee, asserting, “We did this in close coordination with our allies and partners. Every departure of every element was carefully synchronized across the coalition and with our Afghan partners. On no occasion were they caught unaware by our movements.” Notes from a National Security Council meeting found that the U.S. government had still not determined who would be eligible for evacuation, nor found third-party countries to serve as transit points for evacuation, at the time the Taliban had surrounded Kabul on Aug. 14, 2021, per the report. Administration’s lack of plans led to service member deaths and classified information in Taliban hands Another large component of the withdrawal failures, the committee noted, was that the administration did not prepare for a noncombat evacuation operation or NEO. The NEO was not formerly ordered until Aug. 16, days after the Taliban had taken control of Kabul. The GOP committee told reporters every single witness told them that the State Department and Biden-Harris administration did not plan for a Taliban takeover. The committee argues in its report that the Biden administration was more concerned with maintaining a large U.S. Embassy presence over embassy personnel safety, so much so that Ambassador Ross L. Wilson ignored pleas from Austin to call for a NEO. Documents and interviews determined that Wilson said a NEO was not necessary, despite the presence of the Taliban meeting the criteria for one. A U.S. military officer recalled Wilson saying, “I am maniacal about the Embassy remaining in Kabul,” per the report. Because no advanced planning or notice was given, foreign service officers at the embassy have attested that classified documents and other materials were left in the Taliban’s possession. Wilson was told that he had less than 72 hours to get all information destroyed. According to the report, the Taliban’s arrival at the embassy caused panic, devolving into officials filling Tupperware containers with passports and visa foils to burn so that the terrorist organization could not obtain them. During the evacuation, Taliban checkpoints were set up. On Aug. 15, one day after the Taliban entered Kabul, the State Department offered advice to hide at home and “not travel to the airport until you have been informed by email that departure options exist.” When Americans or Afghan citizens who did not have a blue passport attempted to enter the checkpoints, they were “brutalized” by the Taliban. Servicemembers were reportedly forbidden from intervening to stop the Taliban’s brutal actions against Afghans, stating that U.S. troops had to watch the Taliban burn women and execute civilians. Wilson himself faced scrutiny for the evacuation after he tested positive for COVID-19. The New York Times had reported in September that year that he tested positive for the virus and that in a rush to complete the evacuation, military officials had scrambled to put a system in place to screen those airlifted out of Afghanistan for the virus. The committee said in its report that Wilson got a foreign service officer to take a test for him to produce a negative result in order to leave the country. U.S. national security degraded after the withdrawal The committee concluded that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, and therefore a withdrawal of U.S. surveillance and detection, opened the door for the country to become a haven for al-Qaeda and ISIS-K. Afterward, the majority said, America’s standing was “severely damaged.” In a tie to 2024 political discourse, the committee worked to tie the influx of illegal immigrants at the southern border to the withdrawal of Afghanistan. In June, eight suspected terrorists who were on the FBI’s Joint Terrorist Task Force radar were arrested in New York, Philadelphia, and Los Angeles. The men, who had ties to ISIS-K, were from Tajikistan and all crossed through the southern border, with their background checks coming back clean, per NBC News. In the report, the committee notes that current U.S. Central Command Commander Michael Kurilla testified in 2023 that the Defense Department “lacks the granularity to see the full picture” in Afghanistan. He also agreed in a March 2024 interview that the country is now a “hotbed” for terrorism with limited U.S. insights into Afghanistan due to the withdrawal. The committee also noted that the Biden-Harris administration has not conducted a strike against ISIS-K since 2021, “which stands in stark contrast to the 313 operations carried out by CENTCOM against ISIS in Iraq and Syria in 2022.” McKenzie released a warning in 2022 that ISIS-K may gain strength and be emboldened to target neighboring countries in an effort to expand operations. Since the withdrawal, ISIS-K has conducted several terrorist attacks in Kabul, including a suicide bombing at a military hospital, a bombing outside the Russian embassy, and an attack on the Pakistani embassy, per the report. Committee accuses Biden-Harris administration of purposely misleading Americans on withdrawal The committee said the State Department watered down or completely rewrote reports and action memoranda that warned of security threats to U.S. embassy staff and the U.S.’s mission in Afghanistan. In a recent interview with the committee, former White House press secretary Jen Psaki said no one anticipated the fall of Kabul but was presented with real-time assessments from McKenzie and Gen. Austin Miller that said whether the city would fall was a matter of “when,” not “if.” When presented with the information, Psaki said, “I answered the question based on the information I had available at the time, which is what we were all basing the information on.” The committee plans to release more reports from their investigation as new information comes to light, the majority said. Most recently, McCaul subpoenaed Secretary of State Antony Blinken over his refusal to testify on the withdrawal. In a letter from McCaul, he said Blinken was asked to appear in a letter on Aug. 12. The letter said Blinken instead repeatedly requested phone calls to delay. Blinken is asked to testify before the committee on Sept. 19 at 10 a.m. “Every single document and every single word of testimony we received from administration officials were obtained only after a subpoena being served, or a threat of contempt of Congress,” McCaul said. “To this day, Secretary Blinken and NSA [Jake] Sullivan continue to refuse to testify before this committee. I want to be clear — I will use every tool in my belt to compel both men to answer for the catastrophic failure of epic proportions their decisions caused.”","summary":"The Republican-led House Foreign Affairs Committee released a lengthy report Sunday on its investigation into the United States’ withdrawal from Afghanistan in August 2021, with the report detailing preparation failures and department-level mistakes that led to the deaths of 13 service members.

That was the one of the main takeaways from the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s more than two-year investigation into America’s chaotic, deadly Afghanistan withdrawal, according to a blistering report released Sunday. “During his decades-long tenure as a Delaware US senator, eight years as vice president of the United States and nearly four years as president, Mr. Biden has demonstrated distrust of America’s military experts and advisors and has prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America’s national security interests,” the roughly 350-page report asserted. His administration consistently lied to and misled the American public to try to convince them to support his consequences-be-damned view that the US should swiftly end it’s 20-year war in Afghanistan, the review said. Former President Donald Trump’s administration had previously created and entered into the Doha Agreement with the Afghan government and the Taliban to end the US war in Afghanistan. But Biden forged ahead with little deference to the terms of the agreement — no matter the cost — though he would later blame the same document for forcing his hand, the report found. The Doha Agreement, formed in 2020, held that the US would withdraw its troops from Afghanistan if the Taliban met certain obligations. For example, the terrorist group was responsible for “cutting ties with al-Qaeda and other terrorist organizations, ceasing attacks on US and coalition troops, reducing violence against Afghan forces and starting negotiations with the Afghan government,” according to the report. But Biden’s reckless, blind determination pushed aside the agreement’s critical details, the document said. All for show On Feb. 4, 2021, then-State Department spokesman Ned Price announced that the US would begin the review to assess the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement to evaluate whether the US should imminently withdraw from Afghanistan. But “in his testimony before the committee, contrary to his public statement, Mr. Price asserted the Taliban’s adherence to the Doha Agreement was in fact ‘immaterial’ to the Biden-Harris administration’s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan,” the document found. The administration’s “lies” and “misrepresentations” only continued, the report said. “Missing from press releases was information related to the Taliban’s failure to adhere to the Doha Agreement, the ongoing presence of terrorism in Afghanistan, the capabilities of the Afghan government and military with and without U.S. support, and dissent from NATO allies on the US plan to withdraw,” according to the report. “The Taliban were in breach of key elements of the Doha Agreement, [though] the Biden-Harris administration claimed to be assessing the Taliban’s compliance therewith,” the report said. “In reality, the conditions were entirely irrelevant to them.” Advice ignored Biden made the decision to pull out entirely despite nearly every military official advising against it, the document said. “Despite President Biden’s public assertions to the contrary, our investigation has revealed the secretary of defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, the commander of US Central Command, the secretary of state, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and the commander of NATO’s Resolute Support Mission and United States Forces-Afghanistan all advised against withdrawing all US troops from the country — both during and after the interagency review,” the report said. The Harris-Biden administration also ignored the international community’s concerns, barreling past the objections of other NATO nations that deployed to Afghanistan in support of the US. Even key figures in Afghanistan had pleaded against a total US withdrawal, arguing the landlocked nation simply needed more time to prepare. “General Haibatullah Alizai — former Afghan Army general — informed the committee majority staff that he pleaded for more time from American commanders on the ground, saying, ‘Just tell your leadership to stay with us for two more years. … We’re going to take the initiative … it’s in our favor and we can defeat the Taliban,’ ” the report recounted. Failure to plan Across the board, the report painted a picture of an administration that was heavily fixated on the political optics of the withdrawal while lacking the foresight to plan ahead, even for predictable scenarios. In one striking passage, the report underscored that Biden didn’t officially order a noncombatant evacuation operation — the largest the US had ever pursued in history — until Aug. 16, 2021, a day after Kabul fell to the Taliban and just two weeks before the last US troops left the city. “The failure to prepare for a NEO had ramifications not only for Americans and allies in Afghanistan, but US personnel on the ground forced to evacuate desperate civilians in a hostile environment,” the report said. “Those concerns were sidelined by the Biden-Harris administration in favor of optics. “Rather than concede their negligence, US service members and foreign service officers were directed to prioritize evacuating as many people as possible, no matter the threat posed to their lives.” Implications for Kamala Vice President Kamala Harris was sparingly mentioned in the report, which was one factor that former committee senior investigator Jerry Dunleavy cited in his protest resignation from the probe. “Harris was the last person in the room when President Biden made the decision to withdraw all U.S. forces from Afghanistan; a fact she boasted shortly after President Biden issued his go-to-zero order,” the report stressed, pointing to previous public reporting. She was one of 15 administration officials that the report recommended Congress pass a resolution condemning over the debacle. The report’s release comes just two days before Harris’ televised debate against Trump in Philadelphia.Critics such as Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg have accused the panel of timing the report’s release for political purposes. But the panel’s chairman, Michael McCaul (R-Texas), fired back to CBS’ “Face the Nation” on Sunday, “It’s taken me two years to get to this point because of the obstruction — I’ve had to serve subpoena after subpoena.’’ McCaul did fault Trump for one key aspect of the withdrawal — the omission of the Afghan government from negotiations over the Doha Agreement, which occurred under his watch. Fallout Despite the House Foreign Affairs Committee’s decision to release its sprawling report on the Afghanistan withdrawal, its work on the matter is far from over. “We have a lot of unanswered questions regarding the [Department of Defense] … [about] what happened on the ground,” McCaul said. The panel, which conducted 18 transcribed interviews, poured through over 20,000 pages worth of documents and held seven public hearings to produce the scathing report, is also eyeing reforms for the National Security Council and State Department. “Everything we have seen and heard of Chairman McCaul’s latest partisan report shows that it is based on cherry-picked facts, inaccurate characterizations, and pre-existing biases that have plagued this investigation from the start,” said Sharon Yang, a rep for oversight and investigations at the White House.","summary":"\"Mr. Biden has demonstrated distrust of America’s military experts and advisors and has prioritized politics and his personal legacy over America’s national security interests,” the report asserted.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/08/us-news/biden-was-hellbent-on-leaving-afghanistan-ignoring-military-advice-nato-objections-and-afghan-pleas-house-report/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/89097919.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/QmTwTW8k-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-08 23:12:53","author":"Caitlin Doornbos,Ryan King","authors":["Caitlin Doornbos","Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.157},{"id":255942526,"title":"NY House races could determine whether GOP or Dems control Congress","text":"Several hotly contested New York congressional races could decide which party controls Congress for the next years — after the Empire State surpisingly titled the balance in favor of the GOP two years ago. There are now 220 Republicans and 211 Democrats as the GOP looks to hold onto power in the Nov. 5 elections while Democrats are looking to reclaim the gavel in a deeply blue state with presidential pick Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket. Four GOP wins in New York’s swing districts in the 2022 midterm elections helped secure the GOP majority, but now those first-term incumbents face tough re-election fights. Three other races are deemed potentially competitive. The Democrats regained one seat in a February special election, when Rep. Tom Suozzi won back House District 3 covering parts of Nassau County and Queens vacated when serial fibber and convicted crook — first-term Republican Rep. George Santos — was expelled from office. Suozzi had previously represented the district but did not seek re-election in 2022 as he launched an ill-fated run for governor. Key factors in the races this year will include how well former Republican President Donald Trump and Harris fare at the top of the ticket in the purple districts — and how that will affect down ballot races, political insiders said. It’s also the first presidential election since the U.S. Supreme overturned the 1973 Roe vs Wade ruling, largely leaving abortion legislation up to state governments. Over the summer, the Super Pac for the Democratic Congressional Committee and other allied groups came out swinging — running million of dollars in TV ads attacking Republicans as anti-women. The incumbents’ campaigns ran counter ads saying they oppose imposing a national ban on abortion. New York has one of the nation’s strongest abortion rights laws. Republicans say the voters are with them on the major bread-and-butter issue and will put Democrats on the defensive on the inflation-impacted economy during the Harris-Biden years, crime and illegal immigration. Democrats are bullish about picking up seats. “Eight weeks out from Election Day, New York Democrats are building formidable campaigns to reach every voter possible across Long Island, the Hudson Valley, and Central New York,” said Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesperson Ellie Dougherty. “Meanwhile, their Republican opponents are running on a disastrous record of restricting abortion rights, slashing Social Security and Medicare, and defunding law enforcement — which is why they’re panicking about their increasing money gap and losing momentum in these swing House races,” State Republican Party chairman Ed Cox said the major issues a broad swath of voters care about — the economy, illegal immigration and crime — favor Repubilcans. “The impact of inflation has cut into the incomes of workers by 5% to 15%,” Cox said.

For one thing, plenty of people have been conservatives or libertarians all along (me), while others have shifted views over time. There are as many reasons for a change of opinion as there are people, but it’s sad beyond description when that reason is the loss of a child. But that’s what happened to Dawn Allen, who lost her son to a fentanyl overdose, and who is now listening more closely to former President Donald Trump’s tough talk on the border: Dawn Allen wasn’t just a voting booth Democrat — she knocked on doors and donated money, including to President Joe Biden. But after her son died from fentanyl poisoning last year, she grew frustrated by what she viewed as Biden’s hands-off approach to the opioid crisis. Now she says she won’t vote for a Democrat, and she finds herself more in line with the candidate who has focused sharply on the deadly fentanyl epidemic: former President Donald Trump.“It feels like a really bad breakup,” the 47-year-old mother of three other children said from her home in a Chicago suburb. “I’m really, really hurt.” This is heartbreaking. Dawn Allen’s son won’t be carrying on her family’s legacy, and it’s because of a pernicious drug that is flowing into our country across the southern border by the carload. Now, the mom says she’s starting to see some sense in what Trump is saying, the NBC News piece, linked above, reports: Trump speaks about fentanyl frequently; Harris less so.“We’ll bust up and dismantle the gangs, savage criminal networks, and bloodthirsty cartels. And we will stop the fentanyl,” Trump said during a recent campaign appearance in Michigan. Trump has called for expanding the death penalty for drug dealers, using the military to target Mexican cartels and halting illegal border crossings to stop the importation of the drug. That first line in that quote is something of an understatement; Kamala Harris has barely spoken about the fentanyl crisis at all. And isn’t she supposed to be in charge of something to do with the border? Finding “root causes” of the border invasion, and so on?

Appearing on Face the Nation, Haley said: “No, it is not helpful to talk about whether women have children or whether they don’t. It’s not helpful to say any of those things that are personality-driven, or anything else.” “I’ve said that now, will continue to say to Republicans, ‘Stop it. That’s not helpful. You know, if you want to talk about things, stick with policy,’” she added. The former South Carolina governor also referenced other Vance comments from 2021 regarding the leader of a teacher’s union, whom Vance said should have “her own” children if she wants to “brainwash” students in school. Haley noted that while she’s backing former President Donald Trump on policy, she disagrees with his personal style. She added that she also departs from Trump on child tax credits, instead supporting more widespread tax cuts. Haley said that she also disagrees with mandating that insurance companies or the government pay for fertility treatments. She noted that she hasn’t been asked to support Trump on the campaign trail or to advise on debate preparations ahead of Tuesday’s showdown, but added that she’s “happy to be helpful” if her aid was requested. Former Republican Congresswoman Liz Cheney sharply criticized Haley for backing Trump during an appearance on ABC’s This Week on Sunday. “I can’t understand her position on this in any kind of a principled way,” Cheney said. “I think that the things that she said, that she made clear when she was running in the primary, those things are true,” she added. During the primary, Haley slammed Trump as unqualified to serve in the nation’s highest office, but since dropping out has changed to a more supportive tune. “Those of us who have fidelity to the Constitution, have a responsibility and a duty to recognize [that] this is not about partisan politics,” Cheney said.","summary":"‘If you want to talk about things, stick with policy,’ former Trump UN ambassador tells fellow Republicans","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/nikki-haley-jd-vance-childless-cat-ladies-b2609200.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/08/22/SEI218406254.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bkkCTRsI-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:48:33","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":255941324,"title":"Iran gives Russia more missiles, proving AGAIN that US enemies laugh at Biden-Harris","text":"Here’s fresh proof America’s enemies laugh at President Biden, and they’ll do the same to his understudy, Veep Kamala Harris, should she win the top job: Iran has now sent hundreds of short-range ballistic missiles to Russia, The Wall Street Journal reported Friday. The exports, on top of thousands of drones from Iran and missiles from North Korea, will help Moscow level civilian areas across Ukraine — as Washington refuses to let Kyiv use Western-gifted weapons against the airfields that launch those attacks, or nearly any other military targets inside Russia. And Iran’s done it in defiance of repeated US (and European) threats going back months. Understandable: Biden-Harris keep saying “Don’t!” and doing nothing when the other side does. That holds whether it’s Joe telling Vladimir Putin “don’t” in advance of his invasion of Ukraine, or Kamala telling Central Americans “don’t” when it comes to illegally jumping the US border. Heck, Harris is afraid to face the US media in a real press conference; why would Putin or anyone else think she’d have the guts to confront real enemies? And she’ll inherit the same advisers that enabled Biden’s woeful weakness; if she chooses new ones, her record as a California liberal tells they’ll be even more dovish. As it stands, the Biden-Harris team is loath to slap Iran (or push the Europeans to) because it imagines Tehran might escalate the Mideast crisis if we’re mean to it. Plus, Iran’s new (powerless!) president is thought to be a moderate, and the Democratic braintrust fears “undermining” Masoud Pezeshkian before he can somehow do something to pull the regime’s teeth. As if any of the several other “moderates” installed in that puppet position over the last six decades ever made a lick of difference. And as if Tehran wasn’t actually afraid of Mideast escalation: Its entire strategy is to bleed Israel with attacks by its various proxies across the region, while avoiding giving Jerusalem a clear pretext to launch direct attacks on Iran. The New York Times’ crackpot analysts, meanwhile, speculate: “President Biden’s lame-duck status could hamper a response,” which we guess means Joe’s still too busy sulking about getting forced to drop his re-election bid to do his job Not that he hasn’t been lame on national security from his first day in the Oval Office, when he began opening the borders, planning his disastrous Afghanistan bugout and ending Trump-era sanctions on Iran. Oh, and appeasing Putin, too — who has invaded some other nation under every US president this century except Trump. It was President Barack Obama who put US appeasement of the Tehran regime into high gear, even before his noxious “nuclear accord”; Trump axed that deal and had the Iranian economy on its knees — until Biden took over and went back to making nice. Harris, with her total lack of foreign experience beyond showing up for photo ops, certainly won’t abandon the Obama-Biden playbook — and Tim Walz, her perfectly progressive choice for veep, quit the National Guard rather than deploy to a war zone. So if you want to keep seeing America humiliated, its friends betrayed and its enemies gaining, vote Harris-Walz.","summary":"Here’s fresh proof America’s enemies laugh at President Biden, and they’ll do the same to his understudy, Veep Kamala Harris, should she win the top job.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/08/opinion/iran-gives-russia-more-missiles-proving-again-that-us-enemies-laugh-at-biden-harris/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/2023-philadelphia-harris-white-houses-84889431-e1725832681496.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:40:33","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.269},{"id":255941264,"title":"“My US visit is purely for personal reasons,” says Karnataka Dy CM DK Shivakumar","text":"Rejecting the media reports stating that his visit to the US to meet some top leaders, including former US President Barack Obama and US Vice President Kamala Harris, Karnataka Deputy Chief Minister DK Shivakumar clarified on Sunday that the visit was purely personal.“I am travelling to the US along with my family till September 15.

Halkias and other Trump supporters were at the former prez’s event in Harrisburg just hours after Walz — whose botched handling of the 2020 George Floyd protests in Minneapolis are now infamous — stopped down the road in Lancaster. Joyce Portk, a retiree from Lake Wynonah, attended the town hall in the crucial swing state with her daughter. Portk called Walz’s Lancaster trip a “waste of time,” pointing out the lack of specific policy proposals from Kamala Harris’ campaign and saying that is enough to dishearten Keystone voters. “They don’t tell you what they’re running on, so how can you make an informed decision about who to vote for?” she said. Another mother-daughter duo, Mary Lou Flores and Christine Mitchko of Yardley, balked at the portrayal of Walz as a “centrist. “He seems pretty far left, and they’re kinda painting him as this centrist, like he’s this good old boy with the guns,” said Mitchko, a 54-year-old software engineer. “People should start asking him about his record, and he should really speak truly to the stolen valor accusations,” she added, referring to controversy of what Walz claimed about his rank in the Army National Guard and the circumstances surrounding his retirement. “I think that’s pretty important,” she said. Flores, a 76-year-old retired nurse, brought up GOP South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem’s comments about Walz shifting from a moderate Democratic congressman with whom she had a good working relationship to a “radical” governor of Minnesota. “Somebody in Congress was saying she served with him and he was a great guy, really seemed moderate at that time,” Flores said of Noem’s comments. “But when he became governor and I look at his record, I’m not for his [policies],” she said of Walz, who is running with Veep and Dem presidential nominee Kamala Harris for the White House against Trump and his choice for No. 2, JD Vance.","summary":"Attendees of last week’s town-hall event featuring Donald Trump and “Fox News” host Sean Hannity had a clear side message for Democratic veep nominee Tim Walz: Your ticket doesn’t stand a chance here.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/08/us-news/pa-town-hall-attendees-dismiss-tim-walz-people-should-start-asking-him-about-his-record/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/republican-presidential-nominee-former-u-89070464.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:35:15","author":"Carson Swick","authors":["Carson Swick"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.258},{"id":255941196,"title":"How Trump and Harris are preparing for their first debate of 2024","text":"Washington — Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are set to face off for the first time this week as Election Day quickly approaches — with the race upended since the last debate matchup between Trump and President Biden. Hosted by ABC News at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia, the debate could be the only time Trump and Harris go head to head on the debate stage. Tuesday’s debate follows weeks of back and forth over whether the matchup would occur — and under what terms. Though the president and former president agreed in May to participate in two presidential debates, one hosted by CNN in June and another hosted by ABC in September, the second debate was thrown into question once Mr. Biden left the race in July. Trump suggested on multiple occasions that he would not participate at all, criticizing the network. But after Harris baited the former president, accusing him of “backpedaling” on the debate, Trump agreed to the Sept. 10 matchup, while proposing additional debates on Fox and NBC News. Harris only agreed to the ABC debate. What we know about the debate structure so far Tuesday’s 90-minute debate, which will be moderated by ABC anchors David Muir and Linsey Davis, will take place without an audience. It’s also expected to feature two commercial breaks, when campaign staff will not be allowed to interact with the candidates, among other rules that mirror the rules at the CNN debate. During the debate, the candidates will have two minutes to answer questions and for rebuttals, along with an extra minute for follow-ups, clarifications or responses, ABC outlined. No props or pre-written notes are permitted onstage. The candidates will have two minutes to deliver closing statements, and Trump will deliver the final statement after winning a coin toss, ABC said. There will be no opening statements. Candidates’ microphones will only be live when it’s their turn to speak, an issue that the two sides have been at odds over for weeks. While the Harris campaign argued that both candidates’ microphones should be on throughout the debate, Trump said his campaign agreed to the same rules regarding microphones in place for the first presidential debate. The Harris campaign ultimately agreed to have the microphones muted when a candidate isn’t speaking, although the campaign said a pool of reporters will be present and will be able to hear what a muted candidate may be trying to say. The Harris campaign wrote in a letter to ABC obtained by CBS News that the vice president “will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format,” while noting that the campaign accepted the terms so as not to “jeopardize the debate” from occurring. How Donald Trump is preparing for the debate Heading into the debate, both Trump and Harris highlighted their policy platforms on the campaign trail in battleground states throughout the country, where they remained locked in a close race with fewer than 60 days before Election Day. Trump campaigned in North Carolina and Wisconsin in recent days. The former president has been reviewing policy positions with advisors in the lead up to the debate, sources familiar with the former president’s preparation told CBS News, though his preparations are characterized as somewhat informal and include speaking with voters and engaging with the media. Trump told “Good Morning New Hampshire” last week that he’s “been preparing all my life for this debate.” “So, you know, I do. I have meetings on it,” Trump added. “We talk about it, but there’s not a lot you can do.” How Kamala Harris is preparing for the debate Harris traveled to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on Thursday to prepare for the presidential debate, according to campaign officials and advisers to the vice president. She is set to remain in the area until Tuesday’s debate. The vice president and her team have used the time to go back to the drawing board on their debate strategy, a senior campaign official told CBS News, after the decision was made to keep candidates’ microphones muted during the debate when they aren’t speaking. While Harris had planned to pepper Trump with questions, her campaign has had to seek out a new approach, fearing that her ability to most effectively engage with the former president will be hampered by the microphone restrictions. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, who was involved in Harris’ debate preparations against former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, praised Harris’ debate skills and intellect on Sunday, telling CNN’s “State of the Union” that “she is a very focused and disciplined leader.” But he noted that “it will take almost superhuman focus and discipline to deal with Donald Trump in a debate.” “It’s no ordinary proposition, not because Donald Trump is a master of explaining policy ideas and how they’re going to make people better off,” Buttigieg said. “It’s because he’s a master of taking any form or format that is on television and turning it into a show that is all about him.” When and how to watch the presidential debate The debate will begin at 9 p.m. ET on Tuesday, Sept. 10. CBS will have coverage beginning at 8 p.m. ET.

With approximately 70 days left in a compressed campaign, Harris is poised not only to become the first woman to ascend to the presidency but also to be the first president of Black and South Asian descent. Despite the significance of these firsts, Harris has made it clear that her identity is not the focal point of her campaign. Instead, she has chosen to transcend these aspects, focusing on broader themes of unity, patriotism, and a shared American future. At the recent Democratic National Convention, Harris’s acceptance speech was a masterclass in navigating the complexities of identity politics while appealing to a broad electorate. Notably, she refrained from directly addressing her race or gender, except in brief references to her Jamaican father and her mother, a “brilliant five-foot-tall woman with an accent.” This deliberate vagueness allows Harris to sidestep the potential pitfalls of being pigeonholed by her identity, positioning herself as a candidate for all Americans. Harris’s campaign strategy appears to be built on the premise that this election is about more than just party lines or personal identity. It is about the future of the nation and the values that bind its people together. Her message is one of optimism, emphasizing the potential for positive change and the need to move beyond the bitterness and division that has characterized recent years. In her words, this election offers a “precious, fleeting opportunity to move past the bitterness, cynicism, and divisive battles of the past.” Harris’s campaign faces significant challenges, particularly in winning over the approximately 10 percent of undecided and independent voters in a deeply polarized electorate. While the Democratic convention succeeded in introducing Harris to a broader audience and effectively reframing Donald Trump as a small yet dangerous threat, the task of convincing undecided voters remains daunting. Harris’s speech at the convention was a careful balancing act. While she leaned toward centrist policies, avoiding extravagant promises on healthcare or the economy, some observers noted a conservative tilt, particularly in her support for a bipartisan border bill. This centrist approach is likely an attempt to appeal to a broader spectrum of voters, including those who may have been alienated by more progressive elements of the Democratic Party. However, there is a recognition within the Democratic camp that Harris must do more than just present herself as a safer alternative to Trump. She must also address the widespread perception that Trump is better equipped to handle the economy, a key issue for many voters. While Trump has faced criticism for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and his erratic behaviour, his sharp political instincts and ability to adapt to shifting circumstances make him a formidable opponent. The Democratic Party entered the convention riding a wave of “Kamalamania” following Joe Biden’s decision to step aside, allowing Harris to take the helm. This surge of enthusiasm, however, must be tempered by the reality that the race remains tight, with Trump leading in five of the seven crucial swing states. To overcome this deficit, Harris will need to leverage the support of key allies and continue to campaign aggressively in the remaining days leading up to the election. The presence of popular figures like Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and the Clintons at the convention provided a significant boost, with each of them taking turns to eviscerate Trump. Michelle Obama’s speech, in particular, resonated strongly, with her pointed remarks about Trump’s fixation on crowd sizes and her critique of his policies. Harris’s choice of Minnesota Governor Tim “Coach” Walz as her running mate is also strategic. Walz’s appeal among rural voters and his popularity in the Rust Belt swing states of Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania could prove crucial in tipping the balance in Harris’s favour. The Democrats are hopeful that Walz can attract some of the non-college-educated Gen X men and rural voters who form a significant part of Trump’s base. Republicans have dubbed this early phase of Harris’s campaign her “honeymoon” period, predicting that the real challenges lie ahead. Indeed, the upcoming debate against Trump on September 10 will be a critical moment for Harris, as her performance could sway undecided voters and shape the narrative for the remainder of the campaign. Moreover, the US media is eager to scrutinize Harris’s policies and her ability to handle the pressures of the presidency. Her bid for the Democratic nomination in 2020 was derailed by a disastrous press interview, and there is a sense that she must avoid a repeat of that experience. The first press conference or detailed interview as the Democratic nominee will be a key test of her resilience and ability to stay on message. Despite these challenges, there is a growing sense that something different is happening in this election cycle. As Republican strategist Mark Mackinnon observed, “This feels like something completely different is happening. And I don’t know what it is yet, but, you know, just the circumstances, the timing, the compressed election, the nomination – it just feels, looks and smells like something completely different.” As Kamala Harris continues her historic campaign, she is positioning herself not just as a candidate for the Democratic Party but as a guardian of American values and a unifying force for the nation. Her focus on positivity, patriotism, and inclusivity, combined with her strategic approach to policy and her appeal to a broad electorate, gives her a unique opportunity to transcend the divisions that have plagued American politics. In the remaining days of the campaign, Harris will need to continue to navigate these challenges while staying true to her message of unity and hope. Whether or not she succeeds in becoming the first woman and the first person of Black and South Asian origin to be elected president, her campaign has already reshaped the landscape of American politics and set the stage for a new era of leadership.

And any concerns anyone had about her lackluster 2020 presidential campaign were largely put to rest.Her favorability rating has soared among likely voters. She quickly rallied the Democratic base and saw a bump in support among independents, which helped give her polling leads across swing states in recent weeks. And, last week, the Harris campaign announced it had raised $361 million in August alone — nearly three times the $130 million former President Donald Trump brought in that same month.Still, in a reminder of just how volatile American elections can be, a newly released New York Times/Siena College poll found Trump had a one-point edge over Harris among likely voters. The poll might indicate that Harris' momentum has stalled or it could be an outlier. New polls in the coming days will tell more, as will Tuesday's presidential debate.What is certain is that many of the complexities of the 2024 contest never went away after Biden's exit from the race. Here's why the contest remains a nail-biter at this late stage.Despite a series of polls showing Harris with advantages in states like Michigan and Wisconsin, the leads are generally in the single digits and within the margin of error.The latest Times national poll showed Trump with 48% support among likely voters, with Harris at 47% support.The result is unchanged from the Times national survey taken in July.Some important figures stick out in the most recent Times poll.Harris saw majority support among voters under 45. She performed strongest among voters aged 30 to 44, winning this group by nine points (51% to 42%). Meanwhile, Trump led among Gen X and voters aged 65 and older by margins within 10 points.For Harris, turnout among the youngest voters will be key as she seeks to win traditional swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and hold Sun Belt battlegrounds like Arizona and Nevada. Harris' appeal with young voters is a major reason she's been able to put North Carolina back into play for Democrats, which was a far cry from even three months ago when Biden struggled there.In the Times survey, Harris also had a 10-point lead (52% to 42%) with suburban voters, a significant show of support that could make a huge difference should she extend that advantage over her GOP rival.Despite Trump's lead in the Times survey, the former president's woes in the suburbs are perhaps one the biggest threats to his campaign, as it would likely dampen his ability to win in a critical state like Pennsylvania should Harris gain more steam closer to the election.The presidential debate at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia will be perhaps the most critical opportunity for Harris to reach voters that remain on the fence about who they'll support at the top of the ticket.In the Times survey, 27% of likely voters said they wanted to \"learn more\" about Harris. Meanwhile, only 9% of likely voters expressed a similar sentiment about Trump.For the voters who indicated they wanted to learn more about Harris, nearly 7 in 10 said they wanted to hear more about the vice president's policies and plans. An additional 10% said they wanted to learn \"everything\" about Harris.So, in effect, Trump boasts a slender lead against a candidate who remains a blank slate to a significant slice of the electorate.The Democratic National Convention in Chicago was a first step for Harris in emerging from the shadows and onto the national stage. But the debate in Philadelphia will give her time to articulate her vision for what remains the biggest issue of the election: the economy.In the latest Times poll, Trump had a 13-point lead (55% to 42%) over Harris on who would be better equipped to handle the economy.Trump, who has relentlessly criticized Democrats over the issue, has made it a centerpiece of his campaign.Harris has begun to cut into Trump's advantage on the issue in recent weeks, which had dogged Biden as a candidate. Other surveys, including a Financial Times-Michigan Ross poll released last month, actually showed Harris with a one-point edge (42% to 41%) over Trump on economic matters among registered voters.That close result is just another reflection of the competitive nature of the race, a dynamic that will likely remain the same until November.","summary":"Kamala Harris has shaken up the presidential race, cutting into Donald Trump's margins in swing states.

That meant DirecTV customers were blacked out from viewing most college football games and the final week of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, including the women's and men's finals. DirecTV has 11.3 million subscribers, according to Leichtman Research Group, making it the nation’s third-largest pay TV provider. ABC and ESPN will have the “Monday Night Football” opener between the New York Jets and San Francisco 49ers.

ABC-owned stations in Los Angeles; the San Francisco Bay Area; Fresno, California; New York; Chicago; Philadelphia; Houston; and Raleigh, North Carolina, are off DirecTV. Besides all ESPN network channels and ABC-owned stations, Disney-branded channels Freeform, FX and National Geographic channel are dark. DirecTV says in its 10-page complaint that Disney is violating the FCC's good faith mandates by asking it to waive any legal claims on any anticompetitive actions, including its ongoing packaging and minimum penetration demands. DirecTV has asked Disney for the option to provide consumers with cheaper and skinnier bundles of programming, instead of bigger bundles that carry programming some viewers might not be interested in watching. The complaint states: “Along with these anticompetitive demands, Disney has also insisted that DirecTV agree to a ‘clean slate’ provision and a covenant not to sue, both of which are intended to prevent DirecTV from taking legal action regarding Disney’s anticompetitive demands, which would include filing good faith complaints at the Commission. Not three months ago, however, the Media Bureau made clear that such a demand itself constitutes bad faith.” DirecTV CEO Ray Carpenter said during a conference call with business and media analysts on Tuesday that they would not agree to a new carriage deal with Disney without bundling changes. \"We’re not playing a short-term game,” Carpenter said. “We need something that is going to work for the long-term sustainability of our video customers. The resolve is there.” Disney has claimed since the blackout began that mutual release of claims is standard practice after licensing agreements are negotiated and agreed upon by the parties. It has also had one with DirecTV under its past renewals. A Disney spokesperson said: “We continue to negotiate with DirecTV to restore access to our content as quickly as possible. We urge DirecTV to stop creating diversions and instead prioritize their customers by finalizing a deal that would allow their subscribers to watch our strong upcoming lineup of sports, news and entertainment programming, starting with the return of Monday Night Football.” Last year, Disney and Charter Spectrum — the nation’s second-largest cable TV provider — were involved in a nearly 12-day impasse until coming to an agreement hours before the first Monday night NFL game of the season. ___ AP sports: https://apnews.com/sports","summary":"The impasse between DirecTV and Disney over a new carriage agreement has become more heated as it entered its second week","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/ap-abc-fcc-espn-new-york-jets-b2609214.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/28/23/Media_ESPN_New_Services_43512.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:13:09","author":"Joe Reedy","authors":["Joe Reedy"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":255940462,"title":"The Harris-Trump debate could reshape the race. Here's how it'll work","text":"If there was ever any doubt about whether a debate could change the course of a presidential campaign, it's recently been put to rest. So both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris are awake to the high stakes as they prepare to face off this week. The debate is being hosted by America's ABC network in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania – one of the crucial battleground states that both candidates have been targeting during the campaign. Given how close the polls are, including in those swing states, this debate has the potential to have a big impact on the race for the White House, again. When is the presidential debate? Their debate is scheduled for 9pm on Tuesday, September 10, local time. That's 11am on Wednesday, September 11, AEST. What are the rules this time? They're very similar to last time: The debate will go for 90 minutes, with two commercial breaks.Candidates will have two minutes to answer each question, with a two-minute rebuttal, and an extra minute for a follow-up, clarification or response.There will be no audience. (But, unlike the CNN debate, some reporters will be allowed in the room.)No props are allowed.No pre-written notes are allowed, but candidates will be given a pen and paper.Microphones will be muted except for when candidates are asked to speak.There will be no opening statements. The candidates will be asked to give two-minute closing statements. ABC anchors Linsey Davis and David Muir will ask the questions. Trump last week won a coin toss and opted to give his closing statement last. Harris chose to stand at the podium on the right of screen. Have Harris and Trump debated before? No. In fact, Harris and Trump have not met in person. According to CNN, the only time they've been in the same room was during Trump's State of the Union addresses to Congress. This is the second, and possibly final, presidential debate of the 2024 election campaign. The first was hosted by CNN on June 27, local time. Of course, that debate was between Trump and President Joe Biden, whose poor performance triggered a crisis of confidence among Democrats that ultimately led to Biden's withdrawal from the election. Here are the key takeaways from that event. Loading... Harris's last election campaign debate was against Trump's then-vice-president, Mike Pence, during the 2020 race. Their only debate was a less fiery affair than those involving the presidential contenders, Trump and Biden. But Harris – who was separated from her opponent by a plexiglass screen because of the pandemic – inspired some viral content by twice shutting Pence's interruptions down with the line, \"I'm speaking.\" Loading... There were few standout moments, though, as both vice-presidential candidates aimed to do what vice-presidents are supposed to do – avoid stealing the limelight. It's telling that the big meme-generating moment came thanks to a housefly that perched itself on Pence's head and stayed there for a good couple of minutes. Loading... Last week, Trump said Harris was a \"nasty person\" and \"the way she treated Mike Pence was horrible\". (Pence has refused to endorsed Trump, whose supporters brought a noose to the Capitol and chanted \"hang Mike Pence\" during the January 6 insurrection.) Both candidates complain they're disadvantaged True to form, Trump has been trashing the host network and attempting to set early expectations that the debate is stacked against him. \"ABC is the worst network in terms of fairness,\" he told Fox News last week. \"They are the most dishonest network, the meanest, the nastiest, but that was what I was presented with.\" Trump has also complained that Harris's \"best friend is the head of the network\", an apparent reference to Dana Walden, the co-chair of Disney Entertainment, which owns America's ABC. Walden and her husband are long-time friends of Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff. The couple has donated to Harris's past political campaigns, and they held a fundraiser for her at their LA home in 2022. But Disney says Walden is only involved in corporate matters, like budgets and staff size. The company recently told the New York Times that \"all editorial decisions are in the hands of ABC News management and the seasoned journalists and producers of ABC, who hold themselves to the highest journalistic standards\". The Harris campaign is also complaining of being disadvantaged, after it failed to persuade ABC to keep both candidates' microphones on throughout the debate. \"Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor, will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format, which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the Vice President,\" the Harris campaign wrote in a letter to ABC. How have they been preparing? Harris's debate preparation appears to have been more intense than Trump's. She's been staying at a hotel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, doing some practice sessions with trusted staff. One of them is Philippe Reines, who has been playing the part of Trump in mock debates. He did the same thing for Hillary Clinton back in 2016. Trump told a New Hampshire radio station that there was \"not a lot you can do\" to prepare, but that he had \"been prepared for this debate my whole life\". \"You can't sit in a log cabin like [2012 Republican presidential candidate] Mitt Romney,\" Trump said. \"Do you remember? He sat there for four weeks at a log cabin, didn't talk to anybody, and then he came out, he couldn't speak. You can't do that.\" However, the New York Times reported at the weekend that Trump was having multiple debate preparation sessions, and had put in more work to prepare for the 2024 debates than he did in 2016 or 2020. When is the vice-presidential debate? Harris's running mate Tim Walz and Trump's running mate JD Vance have agreed to debate on October 1. That debate is set to be hosted by TV network CBS in New York City. Where can I watch the presidential debate? America's ABC will stream the debate on its website and YouTube channel. In Australia, you can watch on the (Australian) ABC News Channel, including on YouTube and iview. We'll also be live blogging the debate here on the ABC News website.","summary":"Any doubts about whether a debate could change the course of a presidential campaign have been put to rest.

He served as a state councillor from 2011 to 2021 and is an expert in the foreign policies and strategies of China and the US, as well as East Asian security. This interview was first published in SCMP Plus. For other interviews in the Open Questions series, click here. Professor, you have been paying close attention to China-US relations for a long time. Many are calling the present era a new cold war, despite the recent establishment of communications channels. What are your thoughts on the overall trend? I’ve repeatedly emphasised that establishing communication channels between China and the US – no matter how frequent or senior level – is one thing, while producing tangible results is another. Since the 2013 summit between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US president Barack Obama at Sunnylands, California, Sino-US interactions have been frequent and have included online and in-person meetings at the highest level. However, it’s clear that Sino-US relations have consistently deteriorated over the past 11 years. The trend has definitely gone down, again and again. This fully demonstrates that establishing communication channels is one thing, while improving relations and resolving major issues is another. Moreover, if both sides engage in too many talks and are too candid with each other, there may be another scenario: that [both sides] think the other one is not really a good country. Their thoughts may become clearer than if they had not held these talks, which also proves that talks themselves, communication itself, and exchanges themselves, are distinct from the results they produce. Of course, after the [Xi-Biden] summit in San Francisco last November, there were significant and notable advancements in one area between China and the US – namely, a significant reduction in the number of dangerous, non-professional encounters between their naval vessels. This is a major breakthrough in preventing military conflicts. On the other hand, it also indicates that both sides have heightened their attention and efforts to prevent military conflicts because the danger of such conflicts is escalating. You mentioned that, in some fields, the more China and the US engage in talks, the more they will reveal their vast differences. Can you give some examples? For instance, the North Korea nuclear issue. The UN Security Council passed a resolution on sanctions against North Korea in December 2016, just after [former US president Donald] Trump took office. After that, North Korea’s nuclear and missile activities continued to develop, including the development of intercontinental ballistic missiles. Every time Western countries propose new sanctions resolutions, China and Russia always veto them, up to this day. The second example is the Taiwan issue, which has been very clear recently. In May, China conducted Joint Sword-2024A, its biggest military drill [near Taiwan] since early August 2022. Meanwhile, around the same time at the graduation ceremony of the US Military Academy at West Point, [US President Joe Biden] said he had “always been willing to use force when required” to protect the US, its allies, and core interests. These words are all pointed remarks that carry a lot of meaning. Another major issue is that since April 2, when Biden and Xi spoke over the phone, the US has repeatedly threatened China over the so-called large-scale revitalisation of Russia’s military industrial foundation and has already taken some measures. On May 1, more than 10 Chinese entities were sanctioned by the US [for their support of Russia’s war in Ukraine]. The most intense one was when [US Secretary of State Antony] Blinken told Beijing that if China didn’t change its approach towards Russia, they would impose sanctions. To conclude, these events clearly demonstrate that China and the US have been nearly in full-scale confrontations, and it is not uncommon for non-military conflicts to occur over certain major issues. Is commerce another area of division despite more talks on it? What are your thoughts on the Biden administration’s Section 301 US trade office investigation into Chinese goods? There is a special reason for this, which is the US presidential election. From initiating the 301 investigation to implementing high tariffs on multiple [Chinese] sectors at an unprecedented speed, Biden did all this because he was in a hurry to compete with Trump for votes. This is a domestic political issue in the US, and it’s not a new thing to harm China’s economy, but he raised some fields to a higher level. However, the sanctions regarding Russia are quite significant and brand new. In fact, the difference between Trump and Biden rests in their attitudes towards the United States’ allies. But this difference is mainly evident in Europe and the Atlantic region. In the Indo-Pacific region, we should note that the Quad initiative was launched by Trump, the US Pacific military build-up and strategic military deployment were initiated by Trump, and the trade war and the hi-tech war against China were also initiated by Trump. Some people would point out that former president Barack Obama also had an Asia pivot strategy during his term. The principle was established in Obama’s “pivot”, which stated that this region was important and must be competed for. However, specific measures, especially significant and powerful ones, were lacking at the time. Obama focused on diplomatic relations with countries, but he didn’t do much about boosting US military power or strategic weapons systems in the Pacific. It was Trump who did that. How do Biden and Kamala Harris differ from Trump in their overall policies towards China? China has neither the ability nor intention to intervene in the US election, but there’s hope. China is hoping to take the lesser of “two evils”, not the “more evil” option. Trump is truly not good for China. Biden is also not good [for China], but at least he never says the “Chinese Communist Party is this or that”, and he always uses the name of the People’s Republic of China. At least, as stated in his publicised policies, he doesn’t directly aim to overthrow the Chinese government. Biden and [Vice-President and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee] Harris have never and will never regard changing the Chinese regime as a programmatic goal. In contrast, Trump was extremely hostile towards China after the pandemic outbreak prevailed in the US after March 2020. This is one thing. Second, Trump is a very ruthless Machiavellian. Based on these two points, both options are harmful [to China], and China would rather pick the lesser of two evils. China has already announced that it won’t intervene in the US election, and it can’t. Moreover, the act of expressing goodwill in itself would be seen as interfering in the election. Whoever wins, China will still have to deal with it. Some say that the wars in Ukraine and Gaza have given China an opportunity to increase its influence on the global stage. What’s your opinion? Has China’s influence increased? Absolutely not. On Gaza, although the proposal for a two-state solution between Palestine and Israel is supported by more and more countries, for various reasons if you have a strong bias towards the Arab-Palestinian side, your relationship with Israel has been ruined. A mediator needs to have good relationships with both sides. The same is true for Ukraine and Russia. Will Ukraine’s Western allies listen to you? They will say you’re not neutral, so you have no [increased] influence. A true mediator must meet two conditions: first, it must be a major country or one that has a crucial position, like Qatar [mediating between Israel and Hamas] because of its location and geopolitical weight. Second, it must be genuinely neutral. Without being neutral, how can both sides listen to you? If we shift our focus back to the Asia-Pacific region, many people look at three places when they assess the risk of military conflict: Taiwan, the South China Sea, and Northeast Asia. From a geopolitical risk perspective, which of these places do you think is the most dangerous? There are two flashpoints. First, the Korean peninsula, because no one knows what’s happening there, and North Korea is not susceptible to external influence or control. No one can directly and clearly influence [North Korean leader] Kim Jong-un. In the first half of 2017, Beijing almost pushed North Korea to a position of long-standing enmity with China. But it didn’t work out. So in March 2018, when Kim made his first visit to China, Beijing put the [denuclearisation] issue on the back burner. The top priority was to maintain a good relationship with North Korea, no matter what. Denuclearisation should not seriously damage China’s relations with North Korea. Then, in March 2021, after the high-level talks between China and the US in Anchorage, Alaska, it became clear that denuclearisation was no longer a key element of China’s Korean peninsula policy. It was no longer important. The second most dangerous flashpoint is the military arms race [in the Asia-Pacific region]. No matter how many talks there are between China and the US, or how many achievements there are, the strategic military build-up between the two sides will continue to escalate, as long as they have the financial ability to do so. Meanwhile, Taiwan is actually the most stable issue. China and the US have had many interactions, and as long as the one-China policy exists – even if it’s just a shell – as long as Taiwan doesn’t pursue de jure independence or allow foreign countries to directly control it, China will not use force to attack Taiwan. Because using force to attack Taiwan would at least potentially lead to a massive joint military intervention by the US, Japan and other allied countries, including Britain and others. In the East and South China seas, except for some occasional confrontations, things have basically cooled down. China is really not eager to start a war in the South China Sea. The possibility of a military conflict breaking out on the Korean peninsula is the greatest; the military arms race is the biggest and most common direct driving force behind the possible conflict between China and the United States. The risk of a conflict between China and the US in the South China Sea is low and controllable. Many people actually assess the risk of Taiwan by debating what signals are worth paying attention to. What signals translate to a high-risk period, or to a manageable situation? China’s Anti-Secession Law in 2005 [offers some hints]. Firstly, Taiwan’s de jure independence and secondly, foreign countries’ control over Taiwan. Now, the US is actually controlling Taiwan in essence, but according to the law, the foreign force has to directly control Taiwan, such as establishing a US-Taiwan joint command, or stationing US troops and warships in Kaohsiung harbour. However, even if such a situation arises, making the call is very difficult. Both China and the US are constantly preparing for war, but making a formal decision to launch a massive attack is extremely difficult. Therefore, preparing for war is day-in and day-out, but making a formal decision to launch a massive attack is just as challenging as it was five years or even 10 years ago. You don’t agree that the military power gap between China and the US is narrowing and that China is becoming more confident in this area? Many scientists believe that it’s not the case. In some areas, the gap may be narrowing, but overall, it has probably widened even further. For example, recently there has been an opinion that if China wants to engage in large-scale military intervention, [the US] will change its tactics and not move a single inch. Instead, the US will rely on 200 strategic bombers, each carrying at least 12 or 14 missiles. What does this mean? With 200 strategic bombers, there will be more than 2,000 conventional bombs with excellent range and radar-evading capabilities. Assuming that four Ohio-class cruise missile submarines are added, each about 150 metres (492ft) long and known for their excellent sonar capabilities, they can basically get to [mainland China’s] Yangtze River mouth, Xiamen [in Fujian province, opposite Taiwan], or even Bohai Bay without being detected. China’s destroyers are being built at a rapid pace, but China’s anti-submarine warfare and anti-submarine capabilities are extremely weak. The worst part is that China barely has a missile defence system, which is crucial. To conclude, everything in the world is contradictory. If China is weak, it is relatively safe. But if China becomes strong, despite increasing its security, it will mobilise its opponents to counter-attack it, making it relatively less safe. From a broad strategic perspective, some say China’s foreign policy is becoming more ambitious. Recently, it is becoming more distant from developed countries, while interacting more frequently with the developing world. What do you think? This is a cliché, and it may have been true three to 10 years ago, but not now. It’s been a few years since China began interacting more frequently with developing countries. China’s national income and tax revenue have been decreasing, and debt has been increasing. Now with shallow pockets, when China visits other countries it doesn’t give anything in return or pay back, will they be happy about that? First, China has been working on the Belt and Road Initiative for a long time, and is more aware that the countries along the route are very complex and [the projects] risky. Secondly, China’s financial ability has significantly decreased. So I think overall, the interconnection between China and developing countries has somewhat reduced – which is good and right, because a country’s foreign policy has to conform to its capabilities. So you think China is being more cautious about the Belt and Road Initiative? It’s very clear. President Xi emphasised in August 2018 the need to do a good job of painting a “fine brushstroke painting”, which means to observe and analyse carefully, and plan and negotiate specifically, according to the actual situation. Within a few months, all informed media outlets and think tanks had concluded that China’s belt and road programme was shrinking significantly. And up to now, it has indeed shrunk further. As a professor who has been teaching at Renmin University for many years, what changes have you observed in the understanding of international affairs among Chinese university students? To begin with, I have to admit that my assumption is limited, as I only interact with a specific group of students, and it may not be representative of all Chinese university students. However, I can generalise that Chinese universities are tiered. Top-tier universities are quite different from second or third-tier ones. Even though students from these top-tier universities may have a somewhat simplistic view of the world and China’s place in it, they are more sophisticated and less nationalistic than students in lower tiers. Renmin University is also a major alma mater for government officials. How do you compare the new generation of Chinese officials’ understanding of the country and international perspective with their predecessors of 10 years ago? To become a government official, you need to be cautious about what you say. So, even when you’re speaking to someone you know well, unless you’re very familiar with each other, you can’t really expect them to be completely honest with you. Those who pass the civil service exam are undoubtedly clever and understand what can be said and what cannot be said. Over time, they may not only stop talking about certain topics but also become unable to imagine anything different. How would you compare the academic communities in China and the US that study each other? I think in general, American scholars’ views on China are correct, just like Chinese scholars’ views on the US are basically correct as well. [US scholars think] China is challenging American dominance, the US-led existing international order and key political security rules. Chinese [academics] believe that the US is trying to maintain its dominance and won’t allow China to adjust the international system according to its own legitimate rights and core interests – and won’t even allow China’s military aircraft and ships to cross the Taiwan Strait median line. Although the mutual views may contain biases, in general, I think their views of each other are correct. What are your thoughts about people-to-people exchanges between the US and China? There are pros and cons of people-to-people exchanges. The positive effects include increased understanding, but that won’t necessarily mean reduced biases. With more interactions, people can reduce the exaggeration of certain aspects. However, there is a possibility that such exchanges can also prove [many Chinese people’s] original assumption: that Americans are indeed trying to ruin China and exercise global hegemony. And just imagine if Americans were to live in China like Chinese do, what would be the possible repercussions? The depiction of China by mainstream media and the government in the US can be summarised in two words: “suppressive” and “aggressive”. If many Americans were to live in China for quite a period, the two perceptions may become even more solidified.","summary":"Taiwan is actually the most stable issue between Beijing and Washington, as long as the one-China policy exists, distinguished expert says.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/diplomacy/article/3277614/more-talk-not-always-best-us-china-relationship-its-results-count","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/07/16dcb273-d6e8-4da5-9150-c0069263cc0e_a944d2a1.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/04/11/web.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-08 22:00:27","author":"Jun Mai,Xinlu Liang","authors":["Jun Mai","Xinlu Liang"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.137},{"id":255941104,"title":"'Shrinking' California GOP to blame for state's problems argues LA Times columnist","text":"California Republicans share some blame for the poverty, homelessness and crime currently plaguing the state, Los Angeles Times columnist Steve Lopez argued.

It’s one of many factors in rising home prices and homelessness today,\" Lopez wrote Saturday. FORMER DEMOCRAT TURNS REPUBLICAN: KAMALA HARRIS 'DID NOTHING TO CHANGE THE SCHOOLS' IN CALIFORNIA He more directly blamed the GOP for crime and illegal immigration based on its support for gun rights and the agriculture industry. \"Many of them come here to work in the largely conservative agri-business industry, which looks the other way while writing campaign checks to GOP lawmakers. Many more come to escape narco-violence in Mexico, where as many as 70% of the guns are sourced from the U.S.,\" Lopez wrote. \"It’s more than a little bit hypocritical to bash crazy, reckless California on public safety when no amount of carnage in the nation, including mass shootings at shopping malls and schools (on Wednesday it was two students and two teachers dead at a Georgia high school), can loosen the gun lobby’s death grip on GOP lawmakers.\" He also criticized Republicans for refusing to expand their base and regain power in California to solve these problems. \"In a state that proudly celebrates inclusion and leads the resistance to the politics of race-based scapegoating, climate change denial and the stripping of women’s reproductive rights, the out-of-touch GOP has been hell-bent on shrinking its tent.

Pointing to the global economy's interconnectedness in terms of supply chains and financial markets, he added: \"The synchronised downturn in both US and Asian markets highlights how global investor sentiment has shifted, with a move toward safer assets like government bonds and investment-grade credit.\" Nvidia alone, along with expectations of a rate cut in the US, are also significant forces in the market, said Mr Chen.

He pointed to the debate between presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris on Sep 10 ahead of a November election, and a Fed meeting a week later on Sep 17. OPPORTUNITIES IN SECTORS, MARKETS Meanwhile observers said that tech sector still has long-term potential, even if it might have been hit harder in recent times. \"We maintain a bullish outlook on generative (artificial intelligence) and Nvidia,\" said Mr Chen of Wrise Private. \"Strong demand from servers and AI remains intact, and we continue to view market dips as buying opportunities.\" He also said defensive sectors like real estate, utilities, and consumer staples appear more resilient in a lower interest rate environment. Mr Cheo of HSBC said the bank continues to favour the tech sector as well, but wants to increase exposure to others such as US industrial stocks. The bank wants to reduce holdings of consumer discretionary stocks to reflect the growth slowdown, as well as headwinds from the price war in electric vehicle and auto sectors. Broadly, Asia's economic engine benefits from structural trends, AI-driven innovation and an investment boom fueled by supply chain revamps and green transformation, he said. \"We favour equities in Japan, India and South Korea to capitalise on their growth trends, as well as corporate governance reform winners in select markets,\" Mr Cheo added. OCBC's Mr Menon said India's large economy and young population could see more upside in its market.

Mr Kennedy won the election. - 1976: In the first TV debate in 16 years, Democrat Jimmy Carter faced unelected incumbent Republican president Gerald Ford. In remarks seen as a major blunder, Ford said: \"There is no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe, and there never will be under a Ford administration.\" Mr Carter won the election. - 1980: Mr Carter appeared in a second debate with Republican Ronald Reagan after boycotting the first for including third-party candidate John Anderson. The president accused Reagan of planning to cut Medicare healthcare funding for Americans 65 and older. Mr Reagan, who already had complained that Mr Carter was misrepresenting his stands on a number of issues, said: \"There you go again\" and chuckled, drawing audience laughter and coining a catchphrase. Mr Reagan won the election. - 1984: Mr Reagan, 73, successfully defused the issue of his age when he debated Democrat Walter Mondale, 56, quipping: \"I want you to know that also I will not make age an issue of this campaign. I am not going to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience.\" Mr Reagan was re-elected. - 1988: A debate against Republican vice president George HW Bush opened with Democrat Michael Dukakis being asked whether he would favour the death penalty for someone who raped and murdered his wife. The question offered a candidate dubbed \"the iceman\" by critics a chance to show his emotional side. His laborious response did just the opposite. Mr Bush won the election. The vice presidential debate came alive when Dan Quayle, Mr Bush's running mate, compared himself politically to John F Kennedy. Democrat Lloyd Bentsen replied in quiet, deadly tones: \"Senator, I served with Jack Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy.\" - 1992: Three candidates - Mr Bush, Democrat Bill Clinton and independent Ross Perot - shared a stage. Mr Clinton won the election. - 1996: In a debate with Mr Clinton, Republican Bob Dole was asked by a student whether, at 73, he was too old to understand the needs of young people. He replied that at his age, intelligence and experience meant he had the advantage of wisdom. Mr Clinton retorted: \"I can only tell you that I don't think Senator Dole is too old to be president. It's the age of his ideas that I question.\" Mr Clinton was re-elected. - 2000: In his first debate with Republican George W Bush, Democratic vice president Al Gore drew negative reviews for sighing loudly while Mr Bush spoke. \"We all make mistakes. I've been known to mangle a syllable or two myself,\" Mr Bush said during their second debate, purposely mispronouncing \"syllable\". Mr Bush won the election. - 2004: The last debate between Mr Bush and Democrat John Kerry offered voters a stark contrast in styles, with Mr Bush sticking to simple arguments while Mr Kerry released an array of facts to make his case. Mr Bush was re-elected. - 2008: Sarah Palin, Republican John McCain's running mate, and Joe Biden, running with Democrat Barack Obama, clashed on the economy and Iraq during a lively but polite vice presidential debate. Ms Palin frequently displayed a folksy style. At one point, she said: \"Aw, say it ain't so, Joe,\" adding a \"doggone it\" for good measure. Mr Biden and Ms Palin both vowed to make US economic policy friendlier for middle-class workers, but Mr Biden said Mr McCain had called the fundamentals of the economy strong as the financial crisis broke out. The Obama-Biden ticket won the election. - 2012: Mr Obama stumbled in his first debate with Republican Mitt Romney, surprising and worrying his supporters. But in their second debate, Mr Romney, responding to a question about gender pay equality, said he had \"binders full of women\" as candidates for cabinet posts. The phrase became a meme on social media, with tweets, original artwork and a Facebook group spoofing Mr Romney. Mr Obama won again. - 2016: The first debate between businessman Donald Trump and Democratic former secretary of state Hillary Clinton drew 84 million US television viewers, a record for a debate and a rare number in an age of digital streaming. An exchange of insults dominated their second debate, with Ms Clinton jabbing at Mr Trump for sexually aggressive remarks about women he made on a just-uncovered 2005 videotape. Mr Trump sought to deflect criticism by accusing Bill Clinton, the candidate's husband, of having done worse to women. In her book published in 2017, Ms Clinton wrote that in their second debate Trump made her skin crawl by stalking her around the stage, and she wondered if she should have told him to “back up, you creep\". Instead, she said, “I kept my cool, aided by a lifetime of dealing with difficult men trying to throw me off.” In the third debate, Mr Trump called Ms Clinton “such a nasty woman” and declined to say he would accept the election results. Mr Trump won the election. - 2020: Down in opinion polls, then-president Trump came into his first debate with Mr Biden, the former vice president, looking for a fight. But his belligerence worked against him. He repeatedly interrupted Mr Biden and the moderator, Chris Wallace, to the point where the entire event veered out of control. He attacked Mr Biden's family. Polls and focus groups conducted afterward showed swing voters were repulsed by his behaviour. At one point when Mr Trump was interrupting him, Mr Biden said: \"Will you shut up, man? This is so unpresidential.\" Mr Wallace told Mr Trump: \"I think the country would be better served if we allowed both people to speak with fewer interruptions. I'm appealing to you, sir, to do that.\" Mr Trump, referring to Mr Biden, responded: \"And him, too.\" Mr Wallace: \"Well, frankly you've been doing more interrupting.\" Mr Trump would later drop out of the second debate after it was switched to a virtual format in the wake of his Covid-19 diagnosis. He then adopted a more restrained tone for the final face-off with Biden. At the vice presidential debate, a stray housefly briefly commanded the national stage, generating buzz when it perched on vice president Mike Pence's cropped white hair while he debated his Democratic rival, then-US senator Kamala Harris. - June 27th, 2024: President Biden, 81, delivered a shaky, halting performance while former president Trump, 78, battered him with a series of often false attacks, as the two oldest presidential candidates ever exchanged insults. Mr Biden's performance rattled fellow Democrats and deepened voter concerns his faculties had dulled with age. The two candidates appeared with no live audience, and their microphones automatically cut off when it was not their turn to speak - both atypical rules imposed to avoid the chaos that derailed their first debate in 2020, when Mr Trump interrupted Mr Biden repeatedly. The two men - who made little secret of their mutual dislike - did not shake hands or acknowledge each other before or after the debate. On July 21st, Mr Biden abandoned his re-election bid under growing pressure from fellow Democrats and endorsed vice president Harris as the party's candidate to face Mr Trump in the November 5th election. Ms Harris, 59, formally accepted the nomination on August 22nd.","summary":"From Kennedy-Nixon to Harris-Trump: Six decades of debate quips, rips and slips","url":"https://www.breakingnews.ie/world/timeline-from-kennedy-nixon-to-harris-trump-six-decades-of-debate-quips-rips-and-slips-1669936.html","image":"https://img.resized.co/breaking-news/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL2ltYWdlcy5icmVha2luZ25ld3MuaWVcXFwvcHJvZFxcXC91cGxvYWRzXFxcLzIwMjRcXFwvMDlcXFwvMDgyMTU0MTRcXFwvR2V0dHlJbWFnZXMtMTIzMDM0Mzc1MS0xLWUxNzI1ODI4ODc1Mzk4LmpwZ1wiLFwid2lkdGhcIjo3MD","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 21:59:43","author":"BreakingNews.ie,Reuters","authors":["BreakingNews.ie","Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":-0.011},{"id":255944850,"title":"'Stick to policy': Voters want less drama in Harris-Trump debate","text":"A Republican born and raised in Utah, he voted for Mr Biden in the 2020 election but plans to switch to Trump in November.

I've decided I'm going to vote for Trump this time, but I would like to see what the vice-president has to say. I'd like to see how she performs more off the cuff and without an ability to read from the prompter. I want to see how she does with those fast questions interacting with Trump.

Those involved in unscrupulous behavior will be sought out, caught, and prosecuted at levels, unfortunately, never seen before in our Country.\" READ MORE: Trump in court as lawyers fight to overturn verdict in E. Jean Carroll sex abuse suit﻿ Trump's message represents his latest threat to use the office of the presidency to exact retribution if he wins a second term. There is no evidence of the kind of fraud he continues to insist marred the 2020 election; in fact, dozens of courts, Republican state officials and his own administration have said he lost fairly. Just days ago, Trump himself acknowledged in a podcast interview that he had indeed \"lost by a whisker.\" While Trump's campaign aides and allies have urged him to keep his focus on Harris and make the election a referendum on issues such as inflation and border security, Trump in recent days has veered far off course. On Friday, he delivered a stunning statement to news cameras in which he brought up a string of past allegations of sexual misconduct, describing several in graphic detail, even as he denied his accusers' allegations. Earlier, he had voluntarily appeared in court for a hearing on the appeal of a decision that found him liable for sexual abuse, turning focus to his legal woes in the campaign's final stretch. READ MORE: Former Republican Vice President Dick Cheney endorses Kamala Harris﻿ Earlier Saturday, Trump had leaned into familiar grievances about everything from his indictments to Russia's meddling in the 2016 election as he campaigned in one of the most deeply Republican swaths of battleground Wisconsin. \"The Harris-Biden DOJ is trying to throw me in jail — they want me in jail — for the crime of exposing their corruption,\" Trump claimed at an outdoor rally at Central Wisconsin Airport, where he spoke behind a wall of bulletproof glass due to new security protocols following his July assassination attempt. There's no evidence that US President Joe Biden or Harris have had any influence over decisions by the Justice Department or state prosecutors to indict the former president. Trump has eschewed traditional debate preparation, choosing to hold rallies and events while Harris has been cloistered in a historic hotel in downtown Pittsburgh, working with aides since last Thursday. Harris has agreed so far to a single debate on Tuesday (Wednesday AEST), which will be hosted by ABC.","summary":"He has escalated the campaign rhetoric a﻿head of this week&#x27;s pivotal debate with Democrat opponent Vice President Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.9news.com.au/world/donald-trump-threatens-to-jail-adversaries-ahead-of-us-presidential-debate/736cd775-db45-4f8f-9de4-7664a14bbe97","image":"https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/GNVDqMVwEAvddMMGYPviHeSUd5M=/0x0:4829x2716/750x422/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fa0f69f57-983b-4992-8739-525ac4007d89","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 21:37:37","author":"9News,Associated Press","authors":["9News","Associated Press"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.051},{"id":255941224,"title":"Slide over salsa: K-pop takes socialist Cuba by storm","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Bloc Quebecois ready to extract gains for Quebec in exchange for supporting Liberals The Bloc Québécois says its ready to wheel and deal with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's party for support during confidence votes now that the Liberal government's confidence and supply agreement with the NDP has ended.

The most populous presidential swing state has sided with the winner of the past two elections, each time by just tens of thousands of votes. Polling this year suggests Pennsylvania will be close once more in November. A loss in the state will make it difficult to make up the electoral votes elsewhere to win the presidency. Trump and Harris have been frequent visitors in recent days — Harris plans to return on Friday — and the former president was speaking in Butler County on July 14 when he was the target of an assassination attempt. The stakes may be especially high for Harris: No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. Pennsylvanians broke a string of six Democratic victories in the state when they helped propel Trump to victory in 2016, then backed native son Joe Biden in the 2020 race against Trump. “They say that ‘If you win Pennsylvania, you’re going to win the whole thing,’” Trump told a crowd in Wilkes-Barre’s Mohegan Arena in August. Republicans are looking to blunt Trump’s unpopularity in Pennsylvania’s growing and increasingly liberal suburbs by criticizing the Biden administration's handling of the economy. They hope to counter the Democrats’ massive advantage in early voting by encouraging their base to vote by mail. Harris is looking to reassemble the coalition behind Biden's winning campaign, including college students, Black voters and women animated by protecting abortion rights. Democrats also say it will be critical for Harris to win big in Philadelphia — the state's largest city, where Black residents are the largest group by race — and its suburbs, while paring Trump's large margins among white voters across wide swaths of rural and small-town Pennsylvania. The debate is set for the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia. The city is a Democratic stronghold where Trump in 2020 notoriously said “ bad things happen,” one of his baseless broadsides suggesting that Democrats could only win Pennsylvania by cheating. Biden flipped Pennsylvania in 2020 not just by winning big in Philadelphia, but by running up bigger margins in the heavily populated suburbs around Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. He also got a boost in northeastern Pennsylvania in the counties around Scranton, where he grew up. Ed Rendell, a former two-term Democratic governor who was hugely popular in Philadelphia and its suburbs, says Harris can do better than Biden in the suburbs. “There’s plenty of votes to get, a Democrat can get a greater margin in those counties,” Rendell said. Lawrence Tabas, chair of Pennsylvania’s Republican Party, said Trump can make gains there, too. The GOP’s polling and outreach shows that the effect of inflation on the economy is a priority for those suburbanites, he said, and that the issue works in the party's favor. “A lot of people are really now starting to say, ‘Look, personalities aside, they are what they are, but we really need the American economy to become strong again,’” Tabas said. Rendell dismisses that claim. He said Trump is veering off script and saying bizarre things that will ensure he gets a smaller share of independents and Republicans in the suburbs than he did in 2020. “He’s gotten so weird that he’ll lose a lot of votes,\" Rendell said. Harris has championed various steps to fight inflation, including capping the cost of prescription drugs, helping families afford child care, lowering the cost of groceries and offering incentives to encourage home ownership. Pennsylvania’s relatively stagnant economy usually lags the national economy, but its unemployment rate in July was nearly a full percentage point lower. The state's private sector wage growth, however, has slightly lagged behind the nation’s since Biden took office in 2021, according to federal data. Meanwhile, Democrats are hoping the enthusiasm since Biden withdrew from the race and Harris stepped in will carry through Election Day in November. For one, they hope she will do better with women and Black voters, as the first female presidential nominee of Black heritage. Rendell said he is more optimistic about Harris' chances to win Pennsylvania than he was with Biden in the race. \"I think we're the favorite now,\" Rendell said. The debate takes place before voting starts — in Pennsylvania and everywhere else. A national Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey conducted in July showed that about 8 in 10 Democrats said they would be satisfied with Harris as the party’s nominee compared with 4 in 10 Democrats in March saying they would be satisfied with Biden as the candidate. There is some optimism among Pennsylvania Democrats even in Republican-leaning counties, including a number of whiter, less affluent counties near Pittsburgh and Scranton that once voted for Democrats consistently. In Washington County, just outside Pittsburgh in the heart of the state's natural gas-producing region, Larry Maggi, a Democratic county commissioner, thinks she will outrun Biden there. Maggi is seeing more lawn signs for Harris than he ever saw for Biden, as well as more volunteers, many of whom are young women concerned about protecting abortion rights. “I’ve been doing this for 25 years and I’m seeing people I’ve never seen,” Maggi said. Democrats also hope there is a growing number of voters like Ray Robbins, a retired FBI agent and registered independent, who regrets voting for Trump in 2016. Robbins did so, he said, because he thought a businessperson could break congressional deadlock. “He’s a liar,” Robbins said. “I think he’s totally devoid of any morals whatsoever. And you can quote me: I think he’s a despicable human being even though I voted for him.” But Republicans have reason to be optimistic, too. In the nation's No. 2 gas-producing state, even Democrats acknowledge that Harris' prior support for a fracking ban in her run for the 2020 nomination could prove costly. In this campaign, the vice president said the nation can achieve its clean energy goals without a ban, though Trump insists she will reverse course again. Meanwhile, the Democratic advantage in the state's voter registration rolls has steadily shrunk since 2008, from 1.2 million to about 350,000 now. Republicans credit their outreach to younger voters, as well as Black, Asian and Hispanic voters. “A lot of them tell us it’s the economy,\" Tabas said. “And in Philly, it's also the crime and safety in the neighborhoods and communities.” Those gains have yet to translate into GOP wins as Democrats have beaten Republicans by more than 2-to-1 in statewide contests the past decade. Daniel Hopkins, a political science professor at the University of Pennsylvania, chalks up the narrowing registration gap, in part, to “Reagan Democrats” who have long voted for Republicans, but did not change their registration right away. One of those voters is Larry Mitko, a longtime Democrat-turned-Republican who lives in a Pittsburgh suburb. Mitko, 74, voted for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020, and was leaning toward voting for Trump in 2024 because of inflation and Biden's handling of the economy before Biden exited the race. That is when Mitko became sure he would vote for Trump. “I don’t like the fact of how they lied to us telling us, ‘He’s OK, he’s OK,’ and he can’t walk up the steps, he can’t finish a sentence without forgetting what he’s talking about,” Mitko said of Biden. Harris’ late entry into the race could mean that many voters are still learning about her, said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, a University of Pennsylvania professor of communication who researches presidential debates. More voters than usual may not be locked into a decision even as voting looms, Jamieson said, so this debate could make a difference. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

A national poll of likely voters by The New York Times and Siena College found Trump leading Harris, 48% to 47%, within the poll’s 3-percentage-point margin of error and largely unchanged from a Times/Siena poll taken in late July just after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid. Trump may have had a rough month after the president’s departure and amid the burst of excitement that Harris brought Democrats, but the poll suggests his support remains remarkably resilient. The national results are in line with polls in the seven battleground states that will decide the presidential election, where Harris is tied with Trump or holds slim leads, according to Times polling averages. Taken together, they show a tight race that remains either candidate’s to win or lose. Only a little more than eight weeks remain in the shortest presidential election in modern American history. Both candidates have scant opportunity to shift the electorate, but for Trump, opinions are largely fixed. Harris is still unknown to many. In that sense, the new poll underscores the risks and potential rewards, particularly facing Harris, on Tuesday night, when she and Trump will face off on ABC News. The survey found that 28% of likely voters said they felt they needed to know more about Harris, while only 9% said they needed to know more about Trump. These voters, when taken with the 5% of voters who said they were undecided or did not lean toward either major-party candidate, paint a portrait of an electorate that could be more fluid than it seems. Some who are considering Harris said they still hoped to learn more before solidifying their decision, and two-thirds of those who want to know more said they were eager to learn about her policies, specifically. Overall, the poll may bring Democratic exuberance back to earth after a buoyant party convention in Chicago last month and rapid gains in support for Harris after Biden’s poor showing in the polls.

Last week’s GDP figures, stubbornly high inflation and the suggestion there will be no rate cut anytime soon will all no doubt feature. Over the weekend it was reported that Australian Bureau of Statistics data showed almost half of all jobs created in the first half of 2024 were classified as public sector. The AFR reports the recruitment bolstered government spending as private sector growth stalled and consumer spending dropped. Treasurer Jim Chalmers has rejected claims government spending is contributing to inflation and The Australian is keen to keep that debate going by also highlighting the public sector workforce, claiming nearly two-thirds of the jobs -created in the first two years of the Albanese government have been funded by the taxpayer. Which leads us to the latest polling for The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald which shows the majority of voters hold the government responsible for fighting inflation, amid the endless back and forth with the Reserve Bank of Australia regarding what/who is to blame. Only 27% of voters blame the central bank for high inflation, the Resolve Political Monitor found. In terms of economic management, 37% of voters backed Opposition Leader Peter Dutton and 26% backed Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The poll also found Labor and the Coalition remain neck-and-neck in popular support in two-party terms and Albanese holds a one-point lead over Dutton as preferred prime minister, 35% to 34%. Meanwhile, the AFR reports on another poll that suggests Labor is facing minority government and could lose up to 10 seats at the next election, while the Coalition could win back teal electorates in Victoria and Western Australia. JULIA GILLARD URGES LABOR RETAIN QUOTAS As the government prepares to navigate another challenging week and hopes to generate some momentum from somewhere with the federal election forever looming, former Labor prime minister Julia Gillard has called on the party to never remove its 50% female quota for parliamentary candidates, Guardian Australia reports. Speaking to the site to mark the 30th anniversary of Labor’s affirmative action rule, Gillard also warned of the “toxic sewer” of social media. The former PM said while in many ways it would be easier for the next woman who runs the country, in others it won’t. “What has become harder is how dominant social media is in political messaging and political reporting. And as we know from all of the analysis, all of the statistics, the social media world can be a toxic sewer for women,” she said. The Sydney Morning Herald reports the Labor caucus will mark the anniversary in Parliament House this evening, with Albanese, Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek and Minister for Women Katy Gallagher speaking. The paper highlights how the parliamentary library calculates women make up 52.4% of the Labor caucus and 29.2% of the Liberal party room. Gillard told the SMH the stats showed the impact of the affirmative action rule, as in 1994 Labor and the Liberals both had around 14% women. “When we look at the other side of politics, they always said that they wouldn’t do an affirmative action rule, that they would try other mechanisms to encourage women, and that largely hasn’t worked,” she said. On the theme of social media, the ABC highlights the South Australian government has drafted a bill to ban children 13 and under from using social media. A 276-page report released by the government says social media companies would need to take “systemic responsibility” for restricting children from using their products. The report, by former High Court justice Robert French, claims the draft legislation is “available for other state governments to pursue” if they choose. The national broadcaster led overnight with Treasurer Jim Chalmers telling Insiders that the next census will include a new topic that will canvass sexual orientation and gender. The Australian Bureau of Statistics would be left to determine the questions, he said.

ON A LIGHTER NOTE… The UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has revealed his family have welcomed a new pet kitten named Prince into Downing Street. Speaking to the BBC, Starmer said following a summer of “negotiations” the family had decided to get a cat, having previously revealed his children had initially requested a German Shepherd. The new Siberian kitten will live with the prime minister and his family in their Downing Street flat alongside their current pet, a rescue cat named JoJo, and the No.10’s resident chief mouser Larry, the Press Association reported. Starmer said the new pet was an acknowledgement of the upheaval and pressure his job would have on the family. He and his wife Victoria have not named their children or appeared with them publicly in photographs to maintain their privacy. The prime minister told the BBC: “People asked me before the election what am I most worried about and I always said the impact on my children. “I have to acknowledge this is a big move for them and therefore negotiating a fantastic kitten called Prince was part of the deal that they extracted from me.” Say What? I’m making a factual point borne out by the national accounts. I don’t second-guess the Reserve Bank in the way that Wayne has. Jim Chalmers The treasurer on Sunday tried to distance himself from Wayne Swan’s remarks at the end of last week, who claimed “The government is doing a lot to bring down inflation, but the Reserve Bank is simply punching itself in the face.” The SMH reports Chalmers said on Insiders that Swan had gone “much further” than he would have, but defended his own recent claim that high interest rates were “smashing the economy”.

(It is May 17 to save you googling it). That’s just on eight months away. Among the things that change: journalists start focusing on opinion polls; they start reporting more on the opposition as an alternative government, and ask for some policy specifics; and prime ministers and their senior colleagues anxiously contemplate how the economy might be travelling on various Saturdays between now and the last possible election date.

Kamala Harris and her running mate, the Minnesota governor, Tim Walz, turned fierce ridicule back on Trump and his VP pick, the Ohio Senator JD Vance, deriding both for their simple weirdness: personal, social and of course political. If polling is any guide, the tactic has worked like a dream. To Molly Jong-Fast, a podcaster and MSNBC commentator now touring Politics as Unusual, a live show with the Republican operative turned anti-Trump organiser and ridicule merchant Rick Wilson, Trump, Vance and the rest of the GOP are simply easy targets. “They’ve just gone so far afield, this Republican party, that you can mock it all because it’s just so weird,” Jong-Fast said. “All this stuff about women’s reproductive cycles” — support for abortion bans, Vance attacking women who do not have children, endless tangles over IVF — “that stuff is quite weird from an adult man, and so it does lend itself to mockery.”","summary":"Federal Parliament resumes today with the government under pressure on the state of the economy, and Julia Gillard celebrates the 30th anniversary of Labor's gender quotas.\n\n\nThe post Half of new 2024 jobs were public sector: ABS appeared first on Crikey.","url":"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/09/09/parliament-public-sector-jim-chalmers-julia-gillard-gender-quotas/","image":"https://www.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/jim.jpg?quality=70","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 21:01:29","author":"Rich James","authors":["Rich James"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.014},{"id":255942018,"title":"Democrats neglect downballot races. Harris is part of the solution","text":"On Tuesday, representatives for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign announced an ambitious plan to transfer almost $25 million in campaign cash to downballot Democrats across the country. The funds will support an array of organizations, including the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, the Democratic Governors Association, and the Democratic Attorney Generals Association. That massive transfer represents more than just a much-needed lifeline to cash-starved state and local campaigns. It’s also a window into how Harris thinks about politics. Since President Barack Obama’s time in office, Democratic National Committee officials have operated under the flawed belief that donor cash should mainly support efforts to hold the White House and Congress. That belief led to historic Democratic losses at the state level, where Republicans now control the majority of state legislatures and governorships. Harris’ cash infusion is the first critical step in repairing that damage. To make a large difference, though, this sort of fund transfer needs to become the party’s new normal. Harris’ big donation comes at a time of acute need for cash-strapped state Democratic parties. This November, in crucial states from Missouri to Florida, voters will head to the polls to find districts with only a Republican candidate on the ballot. Without the funding and infrastructure to build statewide competitive tickets, Democratic parties across the country are simply abandoning winnable races that could tip the balance of power in state capitals. In some regions, that imbalance has eliminated voter choice entirely. A New York Times investigation published Wednesday found that Republicans were running unchallenged across all 17 races in Perry County, Missouri. Overall, Democrats “failed to field a single candidate for fully half of all partisan offices—well over three times the rate of Republican no-shows,” the Times reports. Over half of all state and local races now feature only a single candidate, according to data collected by the nonpartisan website Ballotpedia. That lack of choice has a profound and measurable effect on both voters and the officials who walk into office unchallenged. Political scientists have found that unchallenged incumbents are generally less effective lawmakers. They introduce fewer bills and miss more votes than colleagues who face potential accountability at the ballot box. Uncontested downballot races don’t just produce lazy lawmakers. They also drive voter disengagement in the political process. Progressive group Sister District has been tracking the corrosive effect of “roll-off,” which occurs when voters show up to cast a ballot for federal races, like the presidency, but fail to vote in state and local races. According to Sister District, Democratic voters are more likely than Republicans to fall victim to roll-off, meaning Democrats will often find themselves underrepresented in state legislatures and governors’ offices. And it’s getting worse. Without the funding to build deep benches of high-quality candidates and the infrastructure to challenge Republican disinformation, state Democratic parties are often outspent and out-organized by GOP field operations. Fortunately, Sister District has just released new data that should help party leaders identify and engage those most at risk of under-voting. Sister District’s new research discovered that roll-off voters are more likely to be young women, centrist voters, and those without a college degree. The group found that 8 in 10 roll-off voters made the decision not to vote based on a lack of knowledge about the races on which they would be voting, and a majority believed that their vote would not matter. By comparison, only 25% of voters who filled out their entire ballot felt that way. As we’ve seen in the wake of the Supreme Court’s 2022 decision overturning Roe v. Wade and eliminating the constitutional right to abortion, votes and voters really do matter. From Texas’ abortion bounty-hunter law to attempts by red states like Idaho and Missouri to ban women from traveling out of state to obtain abortion services, the most extreme anti-abortion legislation has been enabled by Republican-controlled state legislatures. In states where Republicans control the legislature by a handful of seats, roll-off voting has likely played an outsized role in protecting the GOP’s fragile majorities. As the Harris campaign acknowledges, it takes serious financial resources to combat decades of roll-off voting and reenergize anemic state parties. There’s also plenty of evidence that a little bit of national money can go a long way in fixing a state party’s ability to contest local races. After years where nearly half of all local races went uncontested by Democrats, an influx of DLCC money helped the Virginia Democratic Party pull off a landslide in 2023, with Democrats retaking control of the state legislature in time to prevent Gov. Glenn Youngkin’s proposed abortion ban from becoming law. That victory also energized Democrats ahead of the crucial 2024 election, when Virginia is a must-win state for Harris. Harris’ $25 million will go a long way toward helping the DLCC campaign in winnable state legislative districts across the country, but to be truly effective, that donation needs to be more than a onetime contribution. If Harris wins the presidency, she would have the mandate to lead a generational rethinking of how Democrats’ fundraising structure works—and bring national money to the growing challenge of under-voting in downballot races. Organizations like Sister District have done the critical work of detailing just how damaging the phenomenon of voter roll-off is to our democracy. Now Harris has taken on the task of addressing it. In the process, she could build a powerful bench of future Democratic leaders while beginning the long process of undoing decades of Republican misrule in the states. Reengaging voters with their democracy remains the single best way to defend against the MAGA movement’s dangerous extremism.","summary":"On Tuesday, representatives for Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign announced an ambitious plan to transfer almost $25 million in campaign cash to downballot Democrats across the country.

Raphael Warnock, who won a six-year term in 2022 after defeating a Republican challenger to secure his first full term in office, appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday after a shooting in his state claimed the lives of two students and two teachers at a high school. Nine others were injured. He was asked about the comments by Vance, which ignited a media firestorm and were seized upon by Kamala Harris’s campaign as the latest sign of Republicans’ refusal to address such horrific attacks in American schools. The Ohio senator, speaking at a rally in Arizona, lamented, “I don’t like that this is a fact of life” after the shooting took place last week. “Listen, JD Vance claims that this random, routine carnage is a ‘fact of life’. No, it’s not. This is a fact of American life,” Warnock stressed to NBC’s Kristen Welker. He added: “There are children that are troubled in other countries. This only happens here. It’s the guns.” “In America, it’s not safe to be in our schools, it’s not safe to be in our shopping malls. … We’re all sitting ducks.” Warnock is correct; the US experiences shooting incidents in schools at a number that is unmatched by any other country in the developed world. Homicide, with gun violence making up the lion’s share, is the second-leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 30. Political debate in America after a mass shooting typically revolves around the roles of firearms in American society and whether the prevalence and availability of guns contribute to the US’s higher rates of gun violence compared to other developed nations. Warnock, who represents a purple state in the deep south, took the position Sunday that no individual piece of gun control legislation would have stopped the Apalachee High School shooting while pointing to the overall number of guns in America as a reason for the higher rates of violence. “A country that allows this to continue, without putting forth just common-sense gun safety measures, is a country that has in a tragic way lost its way.” Warnock’s victory in 2022 (as well as sweeping victories for him and other Democrats just two years earlier) has emboldened Democrats pushing to turn Georgia into the first real crack in the red wall of the American South. The state is a top battleground for the 2024 election and hosted the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Joe Biden in June before the latter dropped out of the race. The shooting in Georgia’s Barrow County came after the 14-year-old suspect was reportedly gifted an AR-15-style rifle by his father despite a known history of suicidal and homicidal thoughts. Both the suspected shooter, Colt Gray, and his father remain in police custody following the attack.","summary":"‘I don’t like that this is a fact of life’ in America, Donald Trump’s runningmate told rallygoers after four killed by teen at high school","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/georgia-shooting-guns-vance-warnock-b2609175.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/08/21/warnocknbc.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/JvlMRXEw-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-08 20:59:00","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.219},{"id":255937634,"title":"Pete Buttigieg Destroys The Latest House GOP Abuse Of Power To Help Trump","text":"Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg took apart the motives behind a House Republican report on the withdrawal from Afghanistan.

BUTTIGIEG: First of all, of course, I haven’t seen what’s in the report coming out tomorrow, but I do have a question about what they’re doing over there. If they have had three years to assess what happened, why are they delivering a report after Labor Day in a presidential election year? I think it really feeds in to a sense that this is something they’re using as a political football. Look, this administration made the decision not to allow this war to be inherited by a fifth president and to end that conflict. And this is on my mind a lot in September, not just because of the anniversary of the withdrawal, but because it was September 10 years ago that I left Afghanistan. And when I left, again, 10 years ago, 2014, they told us we were some of the last troops, that they were turning out the lights, only to find that it passed on to another presidency and another presidency after that. What’s, of course, most at stake right now, as is true in any election, is our future. And what is going to be the future of American national security? Do we have adults, grownups in charge who understand the stakes, or do we have people who are incapable of taking even the most serious issues seriously? And I think it’s especially revealing and important that, among Trump’s own advisers and appointees who have gone on to denounce him, to talk about him in scathing terms, to make clear that he has no business being president, so many of them come out of the national security side because they saw up close how dangerous it was to have him in charge of American national security and military affairs. Video: The report is a political stunt that House Republicans planned to help Donald Trump at his debate with Vice President Harris.Â It is obvious what the Republican House majority is trying to do. They are hoping that ABC News will pick up on the report and make it a topic during the debate. Originally, this scheme was hatched in an effort to trip up President Biden. Now that Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee, House Republicans have tossed out Biden’s name and replaced it with Harris. The stunt won’t work because people like Pete Buttigieg are calling it out before the report has been released, but it demonstrates how far Republicans are willing to go to abuse power to help Donald Trump.

This is what we’re watching. Trump avoids sentencing before Election Day The judge who presided over Donald Trump’s criminal trial in Manhattan postponed Trump’s sentencing until after Election Day, guaranteeing that the American people will vote without knowing whether Trump, the first former president convicted as a felon, will spend time behind bars. The delay raised a question: Is he above the law? Despite his legal troubles, Trump has enjoyed remarkably resilient support. A national poll of likely voters conducted by The New York Times and Siena College found Trump narrowly leading Vice President Kamala Harris, 48 percent to 47 percent. The results are in line with polls in the pivotal battleground states, where Harris is tied with Trump or holds slim leads, according to New York Times polling averages.

How come the candidates don’t talk about the global view on America and the necessity to reconnect to allies? — Yasha Young, Berlin Edward: The two candidates have very different views on America’s traditional security alliances. If Donald Trump were to be president again, he might not bolster America’s traditional alliances; he could very well weaken them instead. Vice President Kamala Harris has not talked much about foreign policy since becoming the Democratic candidate this summer. But most analysts think she will carry on President Biden’s efforts to strengthen traditional U.S. alliances. Most American voters do not see foreign policy as a decisive issue or a priority in U.S. elections, unless American troops are directly involved in a disastrous war, so candidates generally do not spend much time talking about U.S. alliances or global affairs. However, we might see journalists ask both Harris and Trump questions about their foreign policy views in the televised debate on Tuesday.","summary":"Plus, rural women in China fighting for land rights.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/08/briefing/trump-sentencing-venezuela-west-bank.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/09/arts/09ambriefing-asia-lede/09ambriefing-asia-lede-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-08 20:51:29","author":"Gaya Gupta","authors":["Gaya Gupta"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.004},{"id":255937248,"title":"‘Illiberal’ Kamala Harris joins the world’s autocrats to clamp down on free speech","text":"In 2019, Vice President Kamala Harris told CNN’s Jake Tapper that social media companies “are directly speaking to millions and millions of people without any level of oversight or regulation and it has to stop.” Does it? Every two-bit authoritarian in history has justified censoring citizens as a way of protecting them from the menace of disinformation. But social media sites, contra the reliably illiberal Harris, aren’t “directly speaking” to anyone. Millions of individuals are interacting and speaking to millions of other individuals. Really, that’s what grinds the modern left’s gears: unsupervised conversations. Take the Brazilian Supreme Court panel that unanimously upheld the decision by one of its justices to shut down Elon Musk’s X over alleged “misinformation” fears. We must assume that the Democratic Party’s presidential nominee, who once promised to ban guns via an executive order, agrees with Justice Alexandre de Moraes’ decision to shut down a social media platform for refusing to bend to the state’s demands of censorship. The Associated Press reports that the Brazilian high court’s decision “undermines the effort by Musk and his supporters to cast Justice Alexandre de Moraes as an authoritarian renegade who is intent on censoring political speech in Brazil.” Really? Because it seems to me that the state shuttering one of the popular social media sites unmistakably qualifies as a ban on political speech, whether one person is responsible or an entire government. And make no mistake, it is politically motivated. “Just because the guy has a lot of money doesn’t mean he can disrespect this [country],” Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva argued. Well, the South American nation’s constitution, like ours, apparently protects free expression — making no distinction between the poor and rich: “Any and all censorship of a political, ideological, and artistic nature is prohibited.” You can tell Brazil is super serious about the matter because the bullet point appears in Chapter V, Article 220, or page 148 in my translated copy. Let’s concede, however, that de Moraes isn’t any kind of renegade, merely a conventional Brazilian autocrat. In the same way, Musk isn’t merely another billionaire but a tech CEO who generally views free expression as a neutral principle. I suppose the best evidence for this claim is the fact that even as Brazil bans Musk’s site, he allows the far-left Lula to have an account on X with 9 million followers. In Europe, free expression is also ostensibly protected by the constitution. Well, the right is contingent on “national security,” “territorial disorder,” “crime,” “health” and other highly malleable issues that ultimately allow police officers in the United Kingdom and Germany to show up at your door and throw you in prison for offensive posts. As the late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia once pointed out, “every banana republic has a Bill of Rights.” The question is: How close are we to being one? Uncomfortably close is the answer. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently admitted that senior Biden administration officials “repeatedly pressured” Facebook to “censor” COVID-19 content, including “humor and satire,” during the pandemic. Zuckerberg vowed that he would never let his company be pushed around again. I’m sorry if we don’t take him at his word. Tech companies enjoy unencumbered free association rights and are free to keep or kick off anyone they desire from their platform, as they should. Before Musk’s purchase of Twitter, now known as X, contemporary left-wingers celebrated the independence of social media platforms. “If you don’t like it, build your own Twitter,” they would say. OK. But when corporations, who often spend tens of millions each year in Washington rent-seeking and lobbying for favorable regulations, take marching orders from state officials and giant federal bureaucracies on the contours of permissible speech, we have a big problem. If presidential candidates truly cared about “democracy,” they’d be advocating anti-cronyism laws and forbidding government officials from interfering with or pressuring private entities on speech. But these days, many Americans no longer view free expression as a neutral, liberal virtue worth defending. Foremost among them, apparently, is the Democratic presidential ticket.

Bernie Sanders fended off criticisms that Vice President Kamala Harris has veered too far to the left in the past, calling her changing policy positions “pragmatic.” Sanders (I-Vt.) claimed Harris has been recalibrating and “doing what she thinks is right in order to win the election. “No, I don’t think she’s abandoning her ideals. I think she’s trying to be pragmatic,” Sanders told NBC’s “Meet the Press” on Sunday. “My own view is slightly different. I think that in America today there are a lot of people, rural people, working class people, who no longer believe that the United States Congress and government represents their interests, too dominated by big-money interest.” Harris had similarly defended her past flip-flopping, telling CNN in her first major sit-down since clinching the nomination last month that her “values have not changed.” There’s a laundry list of policy items that Harris has reversed herself on including a ban on plastic straws, a ban on fracking — a position seen as needed to win Pennsylvania. She has also softened on pushes for Medicare for all, a mandatory gun buyback program that aides reportedly suggested dropping, the decriminalization of illegal border crossings and a federal jobs guarantee. During 2019, Harris was ranked by Govtrack as the most liberal member of the US Senate — further to than left than Sanders, who is typically the king — though the organization subsequently retracted the ranking. Last week, the vice president seemingly shifted to the center when unveiling her tax policy on capital gains, while taking not of the potential toll that a dramatic hike could have on entrepreneurs. She called for a a top rate of 28% on long-term capital gains for individuals making at least $1 million per year. Currently, the top capital gains tax rate is 20%. That’s markedly lower than President Biden’s budget for fiscal year 2025 — a budget that Harris supported. Biden’s plan calls for up to 44.6% at the highest level, per some analyses of the plan that were predicated on Biden’s push for a top rate of 39.6% along with a 5% investment-income tax. It’s unclear what Harris would do with that 5% tax. “I would go higher than that,” Sanders said bluntly, complaining that “you’ve got three people on top owning more wealth than the bottom half of American society” and declaring “you could substantially raise taxes on the billionaire class and the people on top.” Sanders affirmed that he still considers Harris to be a progressive. “I do. Look, she is not where I am,” he explained while pointing to her support for expanding the child tax credit and rattling off a few other examples. “When she talks about building 3 million units of affordable housing, that’s a big deal because we have a major housing crisis in America. When she talks about passing the PEARL Act to make it easier for workers to join unions, that’s a big deal,” he said. “I do consider her progressive.” The Independent senator from Vermont also took note of the differences he has on policy with Harris, while stressing he believes that she would move the needle significantly in the direction he wants, using health care as an example. “I think that there is something wrong, personally, when we are the only major country on earth not to guarantee health care to all of our people,” he said. “That is why I support Medicare for all. She does not. “She has another approach toward moving toward universal health care.”","summary":"Self-described Democratic Socialist Sen.
