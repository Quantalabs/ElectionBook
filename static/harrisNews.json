The confluence of domestic and global traumas combined to knock Ms. Harris off a message that has been carefully calibrated since she took over for President Biden to showcase her as the avatar of “a new way forward,” as her slogan puts it. The rare moment of turbulence for Ms. Harris interrupts what has been mostly smooth sailing in her two months as the Democratic presidential nominee. It also captures a conundrum of the vice presidency, a prestigious if mostly ceremonial posting. So far, Ms. Harris has been able to take advantage of the trappings of the position — Air Force Two was parked behind her for one rally in Michigan — without being trapped by it. Ms. Harris, long a risk-averse politician, has tried to both claim Mr. Biden’s accomplishments as her own while defining herself as the future and the 81-year-old president as the past. She barely mentions the president’s name in her campaign speeches and makes a middle-class pitch that aims to correct for the inflation and high prices voters blame on Mr. Biden’s economic stewardship. This week’s events thrust Ms. Harris’s balancing act — of being both the No. 2 to Mr. Biden and atop the ticket in her own right — back into the spotlight.","summary":"Scenes of striking workers, hurricane devastation in the Southeast and missiles over Israel represent a rare moment of turbulence for Kamala Harris.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/02/us/politics/harris-israel-iran-helene-port-strike.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/10/02/multimedia/02pol-harris-world-topart-wklp/02pol-harris-world-topart-wklp-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 00:15:34","author":"Shane Goldmacher","authors":["Shane Goldmacher"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.084},{"id":258270174,"title":"Poll Director Urges Caution About His Own Swing State Survey","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris maintains a clear lead in the swing state of Wisconsin, according to the latest poll from Marquette University Law School, although the survey's director is cautioning against reading too much into the results.The survey, released on Wednesday, found the vice president ahead by 4 points (52 percent to 48 percent) in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup against former President Donald Trump. The poll was conducted between September 18 to 26, and is based on the responses of 882 registered voters.It's a good sign for Harris, who held the same lead--52 percent to 48 percent--over Trump in a Marquette University Law School poll released on September 11. But the poll director, Charles Franklin, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that the \"results could change\" between now and Election Day on November 5, noting that the pollster was off by several percentage points in the 2020 election.\"Remember--not that I really want to remind you--but we were off by four points last time in 2020,\" Franklin told the paper in a report published Wednesday. \"We were off by over six in 2016.\"\"So fair warning, these results could change,\" he added. \"We could be wrong, on the other hand, we could be right.\"Pollsters had adapted their methodologies since the 2016 and 2020 elections, where Trump underperformed in surveys nationwide. For example, while Trump was found trailing President Joe Biden by 8.4 percentage points on average in the final days of the 2020 election, the former president lost the race by a much slimmer overall margin (4.4 percent).Similarly, in 2016, Trump was found behind then-Democratic nominee, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, by 3.9 percentage points on average on Election Day, per FiveThirtyEight's tracking. Trump, however, went on to defeat Clinton despite losing the popular vote by 2.1 percentage points.Marquette Law School's last poll before election day in 2020 found Biden ahead by 5 percentage points on Trump (48 percent to 43 percent). But the president went on to win the state by roughly 20,000 votes, less than 1 percent of the total votes cast.Many pollsters have been proactive about adapting their polling methods to better capture Trump's support since. Ipsos President Cliff Young previously told Newsweek that his poll has adjusted its sample collection by drawing from voter registration databased instead of using randomized lists of telephone numbers, making it easier to ensure that rural voters are counted in the survey.Today, Harris is up by 1.8 percentage points on average above Trump in Wisconsin, according to FiveThirtyEight. Experts have said that the former president's better polling may not be a sign he is actually building momentum in the state, however, instead a reflection of pollsters utilizing better methods.Franklin told Newsweek in an email Tuesday afternoon that the full scope of Wisconsin's race will likely not take shape until November 5, given that the state also has same-day voter registration.\"It then takes several months before election clerks 'purge' the rolls of people who moved or reregistered in new places or become inactive due to failure to vote in several elections,\" he added. \"As a result, the number of registrants drops in the winter after the election. Registered voters will certainly rise by November. But how much? We don't know.\"Newsweek reached out to Franklin over email for additional comment on Wednesday.","summary":"Have pollsters learned from their mistakes in the last two presidential elections?","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/poll-director-caution-swing-state-wisnconsin-1963012","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2486245/poll-director-urges-caution-his-own-survey.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 00:11:54","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.431},{"id":258269988,"title":"Matt Barnes, ex-NBA player, accused of deceiving Kamala Harris about KKK by Jason Whitlock","text":"In a video posted to YouTube, controversial conservative pundit Jason Whitlock has accused former NBA player Matt Barnes of lying to Vice President Kamala Harris in a recent interview Barnes conducted. Barnes was speaking to Harris for his ‘All the Smoke’ podcast alongside co-host Stephen Jackson. In that interview, Barnes opened up about racial terrorism that he experienced first-hand in Sacramento – when the former NBAer claims that the Ku Klux Klan came and vandalized his high school and almost burned it down after he defended his younger sister who was called names. Barnes has been telling this story for years, something that Whitlock recognized, but on his show ‘Fearless’ he tried debunking that account. ‘Wow, the KKK went after Matt Barnes in 1998 in Sacramento, California,’ Whitlock said on his show. ‘Something about the journalist in me said, “Man, the KKK in 1998? Went after Matt Barnes in California?” ‘Now I’m from Indiana. The KKK was strong in Indiana. 30 minutes from Indianapolis in Martinsville, Indiana the KKK [was] very strong. But that’s me a boy in the 80’s. ‘Matt Barnes is talking about 1998 in California, the KKK came after him. This is incredible,’ Whitlock said before playing a clip from about a month ago of Barnes explaining how a Klan member in jail ‘greenlit’ a hit on him for beating up another kid in defense of his sister. ‘They wanted Matt Barnes dead for a high school fight. This is incredible, this is the stuff of movies. Look at Matt Barnes, his life is on the line for protecting his sister,’ Whitlock said, incredulously. After two more clips – including one from Vice News – Whitlock continued: ‘He’s been telling this story since 2014, he’s now telling it in front of the Vice President. it’s the centerpiece of Matt Barnes trying to cast himself as a political figure. ‘He’s talked about running for political office… Matt Barnes has big political aspirations and he’s building this racial narrative that he’s the new John Lewis, the short congressman that passed away and was on the bridge in Selma, Alabama and rode that to political power. ‘There’s a gimmick and a scheme, and I’m not calling John Lewis a gimmick and a scheme, I’m talking about what we’ve seen today there’s a pattern here of the “mixed nuts,” the interracial kids, the biracial kids that are looking for their “black moment”, that wanna be the next Colin Kaepernick, that wanna be the next John Lewis. They all wrap themselves in racial victimhood. ‘And so in that Vice [clip], they showed newspaper headlines from that day. I wish that they had read the newspaper articles from 1998 because they contradict Matt Barnes and the story he’s been telling since 2014 and the story he’s parading around everywhere. Matt Barnes was talking completely different in 1998.’ Whitlock then showed an article from the Sacramento Bee which claimed that ‘hardcore racism may have very little to do with [the] assault on Del Campo [High School]… Interviews with Del Campo students, administrators, sheriff’s deputies and Barnes indicate racism is an excuse this time, a cover for something more childish than disgusting.’ Also included in that article was a quote from Barnes, who said, ‘I don’t think it’s a racial thing. I haven’t really had any racial problems in four years at Del Campo. I’ve had them when we’ve visited other schools, but I expect that. This is more about other things, about me being a jock and hanging out with friends who are jocks. Some kids don’t like that. We’ve had some problems.’ Whitlock pulled up another article from the Sacramento Bee, highlighting how Barnes was involved in multiple physical altercations while a senior at Del Campo – including when he broke up a fight. ‘Let me pause for a moment there: Matt Barnes is saying this whole incident was driven by “oh someone called my sister the n-word and I took off on ’em and beat them up.” In 1998, the newspaper article, in real time, says “the latest incident came last week, when Barnes broke up a fight”.’ ‘This is what was written in 1998, this is what was said in 1998. The story is now completely different. I’m reading the article and there’s another article, you can go and find it for yourself… there’s no reporting of this mannequin with Barnes’ jersey hanging from a noose. No mention of that. None.’ DailyMail.com has reached out to Barnes through his podcast production company for comment on this matter.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIn a video posted to YouTube, controversial conservative pundit Jason Whitlock has&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Matt Barnes, ex-NBA player, accused of deceiving Kamala Harris about KKK by Jason Whitlock first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/matt-barnes-ex-nba-player-accused-of-deceiving-kamala-harris-about-kkk-by-jason-whitlock/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Former-NBA-star-Matt-Barnes-accused-of.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 00:07:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.212},{"id":258269960,"title":"On abortion, Harris fans the flames for electoral gain, fights calming compromise","text":"Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate made the political divide over abortion abundantly clear. For Republican JD Vance, it’s an issue on which compromise is possible; for Democrat Tim Walz — like his running mate Kamala Harris — accepting any state and regional differences will violate women’s rights. Walz’s view is in keeping with Harris’ pledge to jettison the Senate filibuster in order to enact a national right to abortion — even as Americans themselves have at long last been moving toward compromise, based on the safety valve provided by federalism. As Democrats like to say about Donald Trump and border control, it’s Harris and Walz who “want the issue,” not a compromise. If they were truly committed to reducing the divisiveness of which they accuse Trump, they’d look instead to an example set by Democratic icon Franklin Roosevelt on the issue that was, in its day, as emotional and wrenching as abortion: Prohibition. It was Roosevelt who resolved it — by returning the question to the states. National alcohol policy may seem to have little in common with abortion, but in the late 19th and early 20th century Prohibition was the overriding domestic political issue. Like abortion, it pitted the religious versus the secular, Catholics versus Protestants, and urban “wet states” like New York versus rural “dry” ones such as Indiana. Banning alcohol divided the country in ways comparable to abortion — even to the point of inspiring violence. Carrie Nation, the most famous temperance crusader, boasted about her methods: “I ran behind the bar, smashed the mirror and all the bottles under it . . . opened the door and cut the rubber tubes . . . the beer flew in every direction.” The “Anti-Saloon League” asserted that “a new nation will be born” the moment Prohibition took effect. At the same time, the anti-Prohibition New York World lamented that with its enactment, “the Government of the United States as established by the Constitution . . . will cease to exist.” Before Prohibition, alcohol regulation was a state matter — much like abortion was pre-Roe, when states like New York and California allowed it and others did not. But just as Roe v. Wade set a single policy of legalized abortion for the entire nation, the 18th Amendment did the same as it banned alcohol sales across the country. The result of that Roe-like one-size-fits-all policy was not to settle the issue, but to enflame it. Roosevelt put an end to that culture war when he pledged in his 1932 campaign to repeal Prohibition. But here’s what he didn’t do: Propose a federal law to make the entire country “wet,” ignoring regional and cultural differences. Instead, he let the states decide — and, like ice melting in bourbon, temperance soon faded as a force in national politics. In 1904, the Prohibition Party candidate for president received nearly 260,000 votes, 2% of the total; after repeal, it received a grand total of 52,000. The issue disappeared. Democrats, their “unity” rhetoric aside, don’t want to see that happen with abortion. Referendum votes at the state level are finding middle ground — as voters in such red states as Ohio and Kansas have voted against outright bans. At the same time, states like Alabama continue severe restrictions. In November, voters in Arizona and Florida will have their own say on it. The reliable YouGov survey from July showed only 8% percent of voters ranked abortion as their most important issue, trailing inflation, immigration, health care and jobs and the economy. Harris has made clear that she aims to fan the flames — both by endorsing one expansive abortion policy for the whole country, and by perpetuating the canard that Trump will seek a national ban. Indeed, abortion is the only issue being raised by former Rep. Mondaire Jones in his Hudson Valley race against moderate Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, despite Lawler’s opposition to an abortion ban. New Jersey Democrat Sue Altman is making a similar play against incumbent Republican Rep. Tom Kean Jr. Just as Democrats accuse Trump of scuttling border legislation to keep the immigration issue alive during the campaign, so Harris is doing with abortion: resisting the kind of state-by-state compromises that settled Prohibition. Even today, about 10% of Americans live in a dry county. But there’s zero debate about that local choice. In a post-Roe America, we may well be seeing a similar trajectory of federalist compromise on abortion. Democrats are hoping otherwise. November will tell us if they’re right to do so.

Another 10 migrants were injured in the incident on Tuesday evening, the ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The group included people of Egyptian, Nepalese, Cuban, Indian and Pakistani nationality, though the statement did not specify the nationalities of the deceased. The ministry said the incident took place just before 9pm local time while the patrol travelled on a highway near the town of Huixtla, some 40km from Tapachula by the Guatemalan border. The pick-up truck was followed by two vehicles similar to those used by criminal groups in the area, it said, and soldiers reported hearing explosions after which two officers opened fire. Four migrants were killed at the scene while two others died later in hospital. The deaths shine a renewed spotlight on Mexico's policy towards migrants as well as the growing role of the military in the country's security. Mexico has been under pressure from the US to reduce the number of migrants arriving at their shared border, where record numbers have tried to cross in recent years, fleeing economic hardship and violence. In recent months illegal border crossings have fallen, as the Biden administration has toughened its approach to border security in the run-up to November 5 elections, where Vice President Kamala Harris faces Republican Donald Trump, who has vowed a wide-ranging crackdown if re-elected. Tapachula, in southern Chiapas state, is an entry point into Mexico for many migrants making the arduous journey towards the US. Chiapas has also seen clashes this year between the Jalisco New Generation Cartel and Sinaloa Cartel. In July, the turf wars sent some 600 people fleeing across the border into Guatemala. Mexico's defence ministry said the two soldiers who fired on the migrants were removed from their posts and federal prosecutors had been informed. A military tribunal will also carry out its own investigation. It said it reaffirmed \"its commitment to act in strict accordance with the rule of law, under a policy of zero-impunity, and is ready to help the civil authorities to shed light on the facts\". The ministry added it was coordinating with Mexico's foreign ministry to contact corresponding embassies.","summary":"Deaths after soldiers opened fire on a pick-up truck in Mexico have shone a renewed light on the nation's policy towards migrants.","url":"https://thewest.com.au/news/immigration/migrants-dead-after-mexican-soldiers-fire-on-truck-c-16263132","image":"https://images.thewest.com.au/publication/C-16263132/b64cd034fb61e216fc71000e4c0a47b69b40259f-16x9-x0y0w1280h720.jpg?imwidth=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-03 00:03:26","author":"Staff Writers","authors":["Staff Writers"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":0.065},{"id":258271094,"title":"S Jaishankar Meets Kamala Harris' National Security Advisor In US","text":"External Affairs Minister (EAM) S.

U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith’s 165-page filing Wednesday afternoon. The filing lays out his case and the alleged evidence he intends to use in an eventual trial against Trump. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges brought by Smith. JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S ELECTION CASE But Trump blasted the Justice Department Wednesday evening. \"For 60 days prior to an election, the Department of Injustice is supposed to do absolutely nothing that would taint or interfere with a case,\" Trump posted in all capital letters to his Truth Social. \"They disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference.\" \"I did nothing wrong, they did!\" he continued. DOJ practice during an election year has often been to hold off on major actions in cases that could impact elections during the 60 days leading up to Election Day, an unwritten policy commonly referred to as the \"60-day rule.\" The \"rule,\" which is really more of a tradition because it is not an actual rule, has been cited many times in recent years. \"The case is a scam, just like all of the others, including the documents case, which was dismissed!\" Trump was pointing to the other case Smith brought against him related to classified records. The case was tossed out by a federal judge in Florida who ruled that Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel. The former president further blasted Democrats, saying they are \"weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they I know I am WINNING, and they are desperate to prop up their failing candidate, Kamala Harris.\" Trump said the unsealing of the Smith filing, which he called the \"latest ‘hit job,’\" happened because his running mate, Sen. JD Vance \"humiliated\" Harris’ running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during Tuesday night’s vice presidential debate. Trump said the Justice Department \"has become nothing more than an extension of Joe’s, and now Kamala’s, campaign.\" TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY \"This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election,\" Trump said. \"The Democrat Party is turning America into a Third World Country that tries to censor, harass, and intimidate their Political Opponents. What they have done to our Justice System is one of the Great, All Time, Tragedies.\" The former president added that the Democrat Party \"is guilty of the Worst Election Interference in American History.\" \"They are trying to DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY, allowing millions of people to enter our Country illegally. They are determined to stop us from winning back the White House, sealing the Border, and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT THEY WILL FAIL, AND WE WILL SAVE OUR NATION!\" Trump posted. Trump also blasted Smith as \"deranged,\" and said that he, the \"Harris-Biden DOJ, and Washington, D.C. based Radical Left Democrats, are \"HELL BENT on continuing to Weaponize the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power.\" \"'TRUMP' is dominating the Election cycle, leading in the Polls, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are totally ‘freaking out.’ This entire case is a Partisan, Unconstitutional, Witch Hunt, that should be dismissed, entirely, just like the Florida case was dismissed!\" Trump said. Trump’s comments came in response to Smith's newly-unsealed filing, in which he alleges Trump \"resorted to crimes to try to stay in office\" after losing the 2020 presidential election. \"With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost — Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,\" Smith wrote. \"His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress’s certification of the election by using the defendant’s fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.\" Smith claims that the \"throughline of these efforts was deceit,\" claiming Trump and co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.\" The Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts. TRUMP INDICTED A SECOND TIME IN ELECTION SUBVERSION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH Smith was then required to file another indictment against Trump, revising the charges in an effort to navigate the Supreme Court ruling. The new indictment kept the prior criminal charges but narrowed and reframed allegations against Trump after the high court’s ruling that gave broad immunity to former presidents. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in the new indictment as well. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital the release of the \"falsehood-ridden, unconstitutional J6 brief immediately following Tim Walz’s disastrous debate performance is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine American Democracy and interfere in this election.\" \"Deranged Jack Smith and Washington DC Radical Democrats are hell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power,\" Cheung said. \"President Trump is dominating, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are freaking out. \"This entire case is a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Last month, Chutkan said she would not hold the trial for Trump on charges stemming from Smith's Jan. 6 investigation until after the 2024 presidential election.

After Vance lied, again, about Haitian immigrants, moderator Margaret Brennan said: “Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status.\" Vance replied: \"The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check.” Vance was referring to the debate rules. These rules were agreed to in advance by Vance, Walz and CBS News, the debate host. There would be no live fact-checking for the duration of the event. There would be online fact-checking, but not from the moderators. So Vance expected to lie without interference. When Brennan spoke truthfully, saying that Haitians who live and work in Springfield are there with the blessing of federal law, he looked almost shocked. This morning, liberals and Democrats are saying his reaction is so typical. Vance wants rules that allow him, Donald Trump and the Republicans to lie and lie and lie, regardless of the consequences. But that’s only half right. Perfect distillationVance wants rules and laws that protect him and his friends. But he wants the same rules and laws to punish his enemies. He wants the law to explicitly recognize in-groups and out-groups. And he wants those in authority to recognize the difference when applying the law. Most of us believe the law should be applied without fear or favor. Everyone is subject to the law. Everyone should be treated equally under it. When the law isn’t applied equally, we call that an injustice. But most of us don’t understand how equality is seen by Vance, Trump and the rest of their maga movement. Equality is no virtue. It’s a vice. The in-group should never, ever, be treated the same way as the out-group. When the law is applied equally, they call that an injustice. This debate moment is the perfect distillation of composer Frank Wilhoit’s old saying. “Conservatism consists of exactly one proposition, to wit: There must be in-groups whom the law protects but does not bind alongside out-groups whom the law binds but does not protect.” The importance of impunityLiberals and Democrats often call this hypocrisy, but we’re not talking about saying one thing while doing another. MAGA does not pay lip service to equality. It opposes it. Vance was outraged by Brennan fact-checking him, but he would have no problem with her fact-checking Tim Walz. It’s better to call it impunity – for the rule of law and the other small-r republican principles that are enshrined in the Declaration of Independence. Everything about MAGA politics depends on everyone else honoring those values while MAGA subverts or violates them. This impunity is central to their idea of freedom. If they are not free to break the rules, they are not free. More than a “damning non-answer”This was again perfectly distilled during another debate moment. Walz asked Vance directly if Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election. He paused before saying, “I’m focused on the future.” “That’s a damning non-answer,” Walz said. It was more than that. Vance immediately asked Walz if “Kamala Harris censored Americans from speaking their minds in the wake of the covid situation?” He was referring to Trump and the Republicans who were spreading lies about the disease and to the vice president’s role in combating those lies. Walz ignored him, but the answer, for Vance, is yes. Maga wants to lie and lie and lie, not only about the covid but about the election, and anyone like Harris who stands up for the truth violates their “freedom.” Unfairness is the pointThe conventions of decency ask us to at least try to be honest. That’s why Brennan, even though she wasn’t supposed to fact-check Vance, felt compelled to. His lies about Haitians were too ugly to overlook. But asking MAGA to be honest violates their First Amendment rights, and holding them morally accountable for what they say is censorship. “F you, CBS - how DARE YOU,” wrote Megyn Kelly last night.

Because “the Biden administration views its support for Israel in purely defensive terms, and feels a duty to restrain Israel’s offense. The American hug comes with handcuffs.” The result: “Further Iranian escalation,” likely because “the mullahs believed that America would continue to restrain Israel.” “So why not give Israel the green light and help it defang the chief cause of regional instability, the Iranian regime?” “Israel has vast capabilities — as it has shown in Lebanon, Gaza, Syria, and Iran over the last year. But it’s even more capable when its chief ally supports its mission.” So: “The win is there if the president takes it.” Conservative: Kam’s ‘Going To Do’ Problem If Kamala “Harris wants to help struggling Americans, why hasn’t she? She does hold the second-highest office in the land, after all,” roars the Federalist’s Kylee Griswold. With all the problems Americans now face, “it’s pretty rich to hear the current vice president and her running mate talk about all the things she’s ‘going to do’ if” elected. Harris “is exceedingly culpable for the sorry state of our once-great nation — especially since she lied about [Joe Biden’s] health and vigor for years.” She “doesn’t get a free pass, no matter how hard she and her new running mate try to clean her slate with joy and vibes.” Fact is, “when politicians like Harris and Walz drone on about what they’re going to do in the future, you really only need to look at what they’ve done in the past.” Crime blotter: Deceptive FBI Crime Stats “It’s easy to see why some are a little cynical when the FBI reports, only five weeks before the presidential election, that violent crime declined in 2023,” snarks Merrill Matthews at The Hill. Be skeptical of the FBI’s data: “It relies on ‘participating law enforcement agencies’ ” when many have stopped participating. Meanwhile, the National Crime Victimization Survey “relies on responses from some 230,000 households” and shows “violent crime rose by 19 percent between 2019 and 2023,” with urban violent crime up 54%. Meanwhile, “exploding retail theft has led many companies to close stores in several urban areas, both because of unsustainable losses and concern for employee safety.” Fact is, it seems “urban crime is increasing while suburban and rural crime is decreasing or stable,” thanks to “progressive policies like ‘defund the police’” along with significant increases in the amount thieves are allowed to steal (e.g., $950) before it’s considered a felony.” Libertarian: A Sad ‘Cancel Culture’ Win The American Federation for Children fired Corey DeAngelis after revelations that the education researcher once appeared in a gay porn film — a “classic example of cancel culture,” thunders Reason’s Robby Soave. DeAngelis “is being punished for a regretted incident from his distant past that has nothing to do with his current job.” And: “Left-leaning gay media outlets,” outrageously, “are reveling.” But there is nothing inherently “anti-gay” about advocating for “school choice,” just like “there is no tension between DeAngelis’s decision, a decade ago, to appear in a gay pornographic film, and his current work calling for more freedom in education.” Labor beat: Harris’ Union Giveaway Kamala Harris has “called for ‘additional paths’ to good-paying jobs, ‘such as apprenticeships and technical programs,’ ” notes The Wall Street Journal’s Jason L. Riley, and vowed to “encourage the private sector to work with unions, school districts, community colleges, governors, and mayors on Registered Apprenticeships.” Yet “Harris isn’t in favor of expanding all apprenticeships, only the ones controlled by the building trades.” Hmm: Donald Trump in 2017 “signed an executive order that allowed not only unions but also colleges, corporations and business organizations to manage training programs, which are concentrated in a handful of industries, mainly construction.” But unions “opposed the effort” and “the Biden-Harris administration rescinded the executive order.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"How did we come “to the precipice of a full-scale war between Israel and Iran?” asks The Free Press’ Eli Lake.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/opinion/let-israel-fight-kamalas-going-to-do-problem-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/newspress-collage-8ckj8ypde-1727910599605.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1727896314&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:49:15","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":258270220,"title":"Words the VP candidates used most often during the debate","text":"The most frequently mentioned word by the vice presidential candidates during Tuesday's debate, excluding routine and common words, was \"Trump.\"Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio said former President Donald Trump's name 66 times in a rigorous defense of his running mate's record, more than the 44 times he mentioned Vice President Kamala Harris. Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was heavier on critiques of Trump, naming him 44 times and saying Harris' name 28 times. Walz took one of his first opportunities on a national stage to talk about his experience governing Minnesota, mentioning the state's name 26 times. Vance said \"Ohio\" five times. To take a closer look at the vice presidential candidates' rhetoric, CBS News analyzed the words they used in their only scheduled debate, and compared it to the words the presidential candidates used in the Sept. 10 debate. Here's what we found.Breaking down the words by topicLike Trump did during the presidential debate, Vance emphasized the issue of immigration, saying the word \"border\" 20 times, which was more than Trump's 12 mentions. Seven times, Vance said \"millions\" of people were entering the U.S. illegally. He also echoed Trump's false claim that the number of undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is over 20 million. The actual number is closer to 11 million.Vance described undocumented immigrants as \"aliens\" seven times, a term Trump only used once in his debate against Harris. Walz did not use the words \"illegal\" or \"alien\" at all, nor did Harris. Walz responded to questions on immigration by emphasizing Trump's efforts to prevent the bipartisan border bill from passing Congress, saying \"bill\" in reference to it eight times. The vice presidential candidates mirrored their running mates' approaches when it came to language around abortion. Vance said he wanted the U.S. to be more \"pro-family\" and \"pro-baby,\" and his rhetoric reflected that. He said \"baby\" or \"family\" 10 times in the context of abortion.Like Harris, Walz discussed abortion in terms of women's rights, saying the word \"women\" or \"woman\" nine times. He also described abortion as \"health care\" four times, something neither Vance or Trump did.When talking about the economy, Vance focused on high prices, mentioning \"price\" 10 times and \"afford\" or \"unaffordable\" 19 times, echoing common criticisms of rising prices during the Biden-Harris administration. While inflation spiked during the first two years of Biden's presidency, it is now at its lowest point since March 2021. Walz's rebuttals mentioned the Biden-Harris administration's efforts to negotiate drug prices, referencing prescription \"drugs\" or \"insulin\" six times. He also repeatedly emphasized job growth during the administration throughout the debate, using the word \"jobs\" seven times.The vice presidential candidates also discussed housing, more so than their running mates. Walz said \"house\" or \"home\" 28 times in the context of housing; Vance used those words 26 times. More time was dedicated to climate change than in either of the presidential debates this year. Vance focused on \"energy,\" using the word 12 times. He also used the word \"clean\" eight times when talking about climate. Both candidates said the word \"climate\" four times, a word Trump did not mention in either of his debates this year. How the candidates referred to each other and their running matesIn total, Walz and Vance mentioned Trump 110 times; more than double the number of times Harris and Trump said the former president's name in their debate. Harris was mentioned by name 72 times, almost always by her full name. Vance sometimes referred to the Biden administration as the Harris administration, while President Biden only got seven mentions total from the vice presidential candidates. Vance also frequently addressed the moderators by name, saying \"Margaret\" 21 times and \"Norah\" eight times.When it came to addressing each other, Vance referred to Walz by his first name, Tim, 17 times, and by his full name or as \"Governor Walz\" 20 times. Walz referred to his opponent only as \"Senator Vance\" 15 times.","summary":"CBS News analyzed the words Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen.

Biden visited South Carolina and North Carolina to tour the areas damaged. The White House stated that Biden will continue his tour with stops in Georgia and Florida on Oct. 3. Meanwhile, Harris traveled to Augusta, Georgia, to survey impacted areas and provide updates on the federal government’s response. More than 50 counties across Florida, South Carolina, and North Carolina, including the land owned by the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, have been designated as major disaster areas by Biden. The president took off from Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport, after speaking with several of South Carolina’s leaders, such as Gov. Henry McMaster, Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Mayor Knox White of Greenville, South Carolina. His aerial tour aboard Marine One flew over devastated areas of both Carolinas, including Biltmore Village, Swannanoa, Asheville, Black Mountain, Chimney Rock, and Lake Lure. Among the visible debris were flattened buildings, homes still partially underwater, and fallen trees. The president was joined by North Carolina’s Gov. Roy Cooper, Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer, and FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell. Speaking to reporters during a briefing in Raleigh, North Carolina, Biden announced he approved Cooper’s request for 100 percent federal reimbursement of all costs for debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months. He also said that supplemental funding would be needed. “It’s going to cost billions of dollars to deal with this storm and all the communities affected, and Congress has an obligation to ensure the states have resources they need,” he said. Biden’s and Harris’s visit to some impacted areas comes after former President Donald Trump arrived on the ground in Valdosta, Georgia, on Sept. 30. Trump criticized Biden for the federal government’s inadequate response to the situation. The president also faced scrutiny for spending the weekend at his beach house in Delaware. “I was commanding it,” Biden told reporters on Sept. 30 after delivering remarks at the White House about the federal government’s response. “I was on the phone for at least two hours yesterday and the day before as well. I commanded it. It’s called a telephone.” Speaking to reporters on the way to South Carolina on Air Force One, Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas defended Biden’s delayed visit to the area, stating that the president waited to avoid impeding the rescue efforts. At least 180 storm-related deaths have been reported, and hundreds are still missing. Recovery efforts at the federal, state, and local levels have been underway for nearly one week. More than $10 million has been provided directly to those affected by Hurricane Helene, according to the White House. “We have towns that disappeared, literally,” Mayorkas said, emphasizing the severity of the storm. He stressed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) will run out of money in the event of another storm. “We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have,” he said. “We are expecting another hurricane hitting. We do not have the funds. FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.” Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.), however, said Congress had already authorized the disaster relief funds needed for the immediate response. In comments made before prepared remarks at the New York Stock Exchange on Oct. 1, Johnson said FEMA’s relief fund was replenished with the three-month stopgap spending bill that Biden signed into law this past week. “Congress has previously provided FEMA with the funds it needs to respond, so we will make sure that those resources are appropriately allocated,” Johnson said. The vice president visited Augusta’s emergency operations center where, along with the briefing, met with impacted families and business owners and visited a volunteer-run food distribution center. “I’ve been reading and hearing about the work you’ve been doing over the last few days, and I think it really does represent some of the best of what we each know can be done, especially when we coordinate around local, state, federal resources to meet the needs of people who must be seen, who must be heard,” she said to emergency operations officials. Harris described the devastation she saw in Georgia as “extraordinary.” “It is particularly devastating in terms of the loss of life that this community has experienced, the loss of normalcy and the loss of critical resources,” she said, recalling a conversation she had with a woman who lost her husband. She praised federal, state, and local responders for the work done so far, and promised residents that the federal government was “here for the long haul.” “More than 4,800 personnel from across the Federal workforce are deployed and supporting state-led response efforts across the region,” Frank Matranga, director of FEMA’s individual assistance program, said during a media call on Oct. 1. In addition, more than 6,000 National Guard soldiers from 12 states have been activated, including nearly 4,000 in Florida and 700 in North Carolina. FEMA has shipped more than 8.8 million meals, over 7.4 million liters of water, more than 220,000 tarps, and 150 generators. The American Red Cross said it was housing more than 2,400 hurricane survivors in 75 shelters from Florida to North Carolina as of Sept. 30. While the overall number has decreased, North Carolina’s shelter population continues to increase. Officials in North Carolina confirmed that the state had more than 1,200 occupants in 29 shelters as of Oct. 2. The Red Cross also has provided nearly 5,000 personnel and 90 emergency response vehicles.","summary":"The president said, 'It’s going to cost billions of dollars to deal with this storm and all the communities affected.'","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/biden-harris-make-first-visit-to-states-hit-by-hurricane-helene-5734270","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/10/02/id5734224-GettyImages-2175443146-OP-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:40:07","author":"Emel Akan,T.j.

Even with that painfully low bar, I’d say he failed to do the job. The once anti-Trump senator did wear a pink tie, but did not face up to his past comments about menopausal women, “childless cat ladies” and a historically low favorability rate. Instead, he used most of his allotted speaking time to mansplain his views to the two women who were moderating, women who vote, and even his own wife. During a question on immigration, Vance tried to talk over CBS moderators Norah O’Donnell and Margaret Brennan, after he regurgitated dangerous lies about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio. To Vance’s dismay, Brennan reminded the audience that the immigrants in Springfield are there legally. “The rules that you were not going to fact-check,” Vance quipped, referring to CBS’ statement that it would leave it to Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to fact check each other during the debate. “And since you’re fact checking me, I think it’s important to say what’s actually going on.” Vance talked over and interrupted both O’Donnell and Brennan as they tried to move forward with the debate. “Thank you, senator, for describing the legal process,” Brennan said, before the network then muted Vance’s mic. “The audience can’t hear you because your mics are cut,” Brennan said. “We have so much we want to get into. Thank you for explaining the legal process,” she added, in a tone every woman sitting in a cubicle, boardroom or classroom knows deep in her bones. Unlike his windmill-, shark- and Hannibal Lecter-obsessed running mate, Vance deftly wields a very specific type of misogyny that, while far less obvious, is just as insidious — one that can come off as empathic, but is undeniably condescending as it normalizes the most draconian right-wing policies. One example of this was Vance consistently referring to Brennan — a woman he does not personally know — by her first name rather than addressing her appropriately. The slight-of-hand misogynistic move may have been Vance’s attempt to appear likable and down-to-earth, but many viewers saw it differently: condescending, patronizing and rude. Vance himself admitted that the Republican Party has a problem when it comes to women’s trust. He reminded women watching Tuesday that they do not trust Republicans when it comes to abortion and the human right to bodily autonomy — yet failed to explain how he, his running mate and his fellow party members plan to address the problem. “We’ve got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people’s trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don’t trust us,” Vance said, before claiming that is “one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.” To demonstrate his party’s commitment to earning that end, Vance lied about not supporting a nationwide abortion ban, the realities of abortion care later in pregnancy, and Minnesota’s PRO Act, signed by his opponent, Gov. Tim Walz. Because nothing says “trust me, I know what’s best for you” like holding an impromptu masterclass on gaslighting. While Vance was able to appear far more level-headed than Trump in his fateful debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, it was Vance’s faux praise of his wife while discussing the necessity of child care that truly embodied his very specific type of mansplaining and misogyny. “I speak from this very personally because I’m married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I’m so proud of her,” Vance began. “But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.” It’s telling, when a man publicly laments the challenges his working wife faces, yet doesn’t seem to face those same challenges as a working father. While appearing to appreciate all his wife does, Vance still chose to mansplain how hard it is to work outside the home while managing the majority of child care and household responsibilities without structural support — the exact structural support Republicans have historically opposed. For his bropropriating coup de grâce, Vance then pontificated on the importance of giving a “family care model that makes choice possible.” “The cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want,” Vance said, ignoring how anti-abortion laws make it difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible for women to choose when and how to start creating a “family model” in the first place. Overall, it’s true that during Tuesday’s debate Vance succeeded in portraying himself as a level-headed, somewhat ordinary politician (if the definition of “ordinary” is calmly discussing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history). But that is perhaps what makes Vance far more Machiavellian than Trump even. And it’s what should put us all on high alert as we prepare to head to the polls in November.","summary":"JD Vance's performance during the vice presidential debate with Minnesota Gov.

The former president is currently seeking a second term in a tight race with Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump has pleaded not guilty to all charges. \"At its core, the defendant's scheme was a private one,\" prosecutors allege in the motion, unsealed Wednesday. \"He extensively used private actors and his campaign infrastructure to attempt to overturn the election results and operated in a private capacity as a candidate for office.\" Earlier this year, the Supreme Court ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts. Smith responded by filing another indictment in August, narrowing the allegations against Trump and claiming the former president was acting as a private candidate when he questioned his 2020 election loss. On Wednesday, Trump's lawyers opposed the filing, which they described as \"tantamount to a premature and improper special counsel report,\" arguing that the public release of Smith's case violates Department of Justice policies and could influence the election. Trump also blasted the timing of the document's unsealing, calling it \"election interference\" following Tuesday night's debate and with less than five weeks before the election. \"Democrats are weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they know I am winning, and they are desperate to prop up their failing candidate, Kamala Harris,\" Trump wrote Wednesday in a post on Truth Social. \"The DOJ pushed out this latest 'hit job' today because JD Vance humiliated Tim Walz last night in the debate,\" Trump added. \"The Democrat party is turning America into a Third World country that tries to censor, harass and intimidate their political opponents.\" In Wednesday's filing, prosecutors identified witnesses they would call at a trial to testify against Trump, including election officials in battleground states and his White House deputy chief of staff. \"With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,\" Smith wrote. \"His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Mike Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress's certification of the election by using the defendant's fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on Jan. 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the U.S. Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification,\" prosecutors alleged in the filing. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung called the filing \"falsehood-ridden\" and \"unconstitutional.\" \"Deranged Jack Smith and Washington D.C., radical Democrats are hell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power,\" Cheung claimed Wednesday. \"President Trump is dominating, and the radical Democrats throughout the deep state are freaking out.

The agency is being stretched as it works with states to assess damage from Hurricane Helene and delivers meals, water, generators and other critical supplies. The storm struck Florida last week, then plowed through several states in the Southeast, flooding towns and killing more than 160 people. Mayorkas was not specific about how much additional money the agency may need, but his remarks on Air Force One underscored concerns voiced by President Joe Biden and some lawmakers earlier this week that Congress may need to pass a supplemental spending bill this fall to help states with recovery efforts. “We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,” Mayorkas said. “FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.” Hurricane season runs June 1 to Nov. 30, but most hurricanes typically occur in September and October. Congress recently replenished a key source of FEMA’s response efforts, providing $20 billion for the agency’s disaster relief fund as part of a short-term government spending bill to fund the government through Dec. 20. The bill also gave FEMA flexibility to draw on the money more quickly as needed. Both chambers of Congress are scheduled, however, to be in their home states and districts until after the election, as lawmakers focus on campaigning. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave no hint he was considering changing that schedule during a speech Tuesday. He said that Congress just provided FEMA with the funds it needs to respond and that lawmakers would make sure those resources are appropriately allocated. A bipartisan group of Senators from affected states wrote their leadership this week saying it’s clear Congress must act to meet constituents’ needs. They said that may even require Congress to come back in October, ahead of the election. Mayorkas made his comments as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris fanned out across the Southeast to witness the damage from the hurricane and seek to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia. More than 150,000 households have registered for assistance with FEMA, and that number is expected to rise rapidly in the coming days, said Frank Matranga, an agency representative. The devastation was especially severe in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where at least 57 people died in and around Asheville, North Carolina, a tourism haven known for its art galleries, breweries and outdoor activities. “Communities were wiped off the map,” North Carolina’s governor, Roy Cooper, said at a news conference Tuesday.

A kind man that will get his face ripped off in a negotiation,” his second post on X reads. “Not someone that I want making consequential decisions for all Americans.” Walz and Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns. The candidates sparred — and sometimes agreed — on their plans to address issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, immigration, abortion laws and their respective tickets’ economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance’s microphone. Ackman wrote that Tuesday night’s debate served as a “clear reference check” on presidential front-runners Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump “and their ability to identify and recruit talent.” “You can judge the quality of a leader by the talent and intelligence of their direct reports. Strong leaders hire team members that are smarter than they are. Weak leaders hire weak direct reports. They don’t want to be outshone by the people they employ,” Ackman’s third X post said. “You have to give [Trump] credit for choosing JD Vance even though Vance was initially critical of him.” Fox News’ latest September polling shows Harris edging Trump by two points in a head-to-head matchup, as more voters see Harris as the candidate who will help the middle class, Hispanics and independents swing in her direction. On Wednesday, both vice presidential candidates continued their campaigns in swing states as Vance visited Michigan and Walz headed to Pennsylvania. Fox News’ Emma Colton, Jamie Joseph and Dana Blanton contributed to this report.","summary":"\"JD Vance is whip smart, measured, unflappable and fair and respectful to Walz.

Biden flew into the Carolinas and his deputy headed to Georgia after Harris’s election rival Donald Trump sought to turn their handling of the disaster into campaign fodder. Biden arrived in South Carolina and greeted officials who briefed him on the sprawling rescue and recovery effort – an operation featuring more than 10,000 federal officials, emergency responders and National Guard across the US southeast after the enormous storm left at least 159 people dead in six states. He then flew by helicopter over the flood-hit city of Asheville, North Carolina, where staggering destruction was visible below including collapsed bridges, lakes filled with debris, buildings demolished and roads washed away. US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, travelling with the president, described Helene as a storm of “historic strength” that brought calamitous flooding to cities and remote mountain communities. “We have towns that have disappeared, literally,” he said. “This is a multibillion-dollar, multi-year recovery.” Biden announced the deployment of up to 1,000 active-duty soldiers to North Carolina to boost emergency response efforts including the “fight to save lives” in devastated communities. “These soldiers will speed up the delivery of life-saving supplies of food, water, and medicine to isolated communities in North Carolina,” the president said in a statement. “We are here for you – and we will stay here for as long as it takes.” Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee for the November 5 election, flew separately to the southern state of Georgia, which has also been badly hit. She visited an operations centre in Augusta where she praised emergency workers and the ongoing response. “It really does represent some of the best of what we each know can be done, especially when we coordinate around local, state, federal resources to meet the needs of people who must be seen, who must be heard,” Harris said. Afterward she met residents in a storm-ravaged Augusta neighbourhood. Debris was scattered across the road and toppled trees were visible, including one that fell on a house. North Carolina and Georgia are two of the seven crucial swing states likely to decide the result of the US election. Early voting has already begun in several states. The White House announced Biden will also travel on Thursday to Florida, where Helene roared ashore last week as a Category 4 hurricane, and Georgia. Deluges triggered by Helene have caused huge damage in the Appalachian Mountains, with towns and villages cut off. In Tennessee, a massive search operation was under way near the Nolichucky River, where the water flow had reached record levels. “There are people still missing,” Governor Bill Lee told a press conference. “We’re in the middle of what is a remarkably difficult and tragic unfolding in east Tennessee.” The Biden and Harris visits come a day after the vice presidential candidates, Republican J.D. Vance and Democrat Tim Walz, faced off in television debate – the last scheduled onstage showdown before election day. The pair acknowledged common ground about the storm response, with Vance saying: “We want as robust and aggressive a federal response as we can get to save as many lives as possible.” But Republican former US president Trump earlier sought to make political capital out of the disaster, accusing the Biden administration, without evidence, of ignoring the crisis and denying help to his supporters. Responding to the accusations, Biden told reporters Monday that Trump was “lying” and termed his attacks “irresponsible”. The political storm over Helene comes as Biden and Harris endure a series of crises with barely a month until the knife-edge election. As they coordinate the hurricane response, Biden and Harris are also contending with escalating tensions between Iran and Israel, and a strike by dockworkers that threatens the country’s economy, a major issue ahead of the November 5 poll.","summary":"Trump has been seeking to turn the administration’s handling of the disaster into campaign fodder.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3280866/joe-biden-and-kamala-harris-visit-areas-devastated-hurricane-helene","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/10/03/fcd0d8a2-be8a-41ba-b386-0f6794fd166e_f1b324df.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:28:22","author":"Agence France-Presse","authors":["Agence France-Presse"],"language":"en","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":258269100,"title":"Republican senator plans to combine healthcare reform and extension of Trump-era tax cuts into a comprehensive bill for 2025.","text":"As Donald Trump calls for overhauling the Affordable Care Act with a new health care system, one Republican senator running for an influential leadership position says the party should combine that pursuit with a major tax bill in the new year. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., told NBC News after the vice presidential debate in New York Tuesday night that if voters elect Trump and GOP-controlled Congress, Republicans will be able to “make health care more affordable, more tailored and more personalized than the one size fits all option,” referring to the ACA, or Obamacare. “We’ll have an opportunity next year, when it comes time to extend the Trump tax cuts, to adopt new policies that again will make health care more affordable and more personalized,” Cotton said. “Because a lot of health care in this country does go through our tax code. So I think that’ll be a very good opportunity next year.” Republicans are widely eyeing an extension of the Trump tax law as major portions of the 2017 measure expire at the end of next year, calling it necessary to prevent a tax hike on Americans. Cotton, who is running to the be No. 3 Republican senator next as part of a leadership shuffle, said the GOP can attach health care changes to an extension of the Trump tax cuts through the filibuster-proof “reconciliation” process on spending and taxes; that would allow them to pass both major policy bills at once with only Republican votes if they secure majorities in Congress. “Because the Democrats have become so obstructionist on President Trump, the opportunity to pass major legislation next year will probably be centered on the extension of the Trump tax cuts from 2017 in addition to other measures,” Cotton said. Trump has called Obamacare “lousy” and said he wants to replace it, but has not offered an alternative plan, saying during the Sept. 10 presidential debate he has “concepts of a plan” to remake the health care system without getting specific. The Trump campaign has not provided a timeline for when he will release a plan. Kamala Harris is running TV ads attacking Trump’s push to reopen the ACA debate, saying he would seek to repeal the ACA, which would rescind subsidies that help Americans buy coverage and undo regulations that prevent insurers from charging people with preexisting conditions higher prices. Even if they sweep the election, it’s far from clear Republicans would find enough support to revive their fight against the ACA, now that the law has grown popular. Many GOP lawmakers prefer to close that chapter after exit polls indicated that they paid a price in the 2018 and 2020 elections for trying to repeal it. But Trump’s influence over the party will likely grow if he wins this fall. Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who sits on the Finance Committee that oversees tax and health care policy, said Congress will scrutinize Trump’s litany of expensive proposals in a tax bill. They include extending the 2017 tax cuts, eliminating taxes on tips and on Social Security income, among others projected to cost trillions of dollars. “Great to have a discussion, but at the end of the day, we’re going to have to either get 51 or 60 votes — 51 through reconciliation or 60 votes to change these things,” Tillis said. “That’s when the pay-fors and the impacts have to be taken into account.” Tillis was referring to the fact that Senate rules impose budgetary constraints on what can pass through the 51-vote reconciliation process, which Republicans will have to contend with. “So we’ll take all these in but we can’t be everything to everybody all at once,” he said. “We’ve got to pass something, likely through reconciliation, and we’ll just have to see how those priorities play out — and how we pay for it.” In 2017, Trump and Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the ACA but failed. Months later, Cotton successfully persuaded the party to use the separate tax law to zero out the ACA’s individual mandate (which required people to pay a penalty if they did not get insurance), a policy that went through the tax code. Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., who’s running to be the next Senate GOP leader, said the scope of reconciliation has expanded “significantly” and that it gives Republicans “an opportunity to address hopefully tax policy as well as perhaps some other achievable things.” He didn’t suggest a health care overhaul would be one of them, but he made clear that a tax bill is inevitable to prevent a tax hike. “Clearly, we’ve got to do something,” Thune said.

Wade, Melania Trump has proudly professed her support for abortion and a woman’s right to choose in her forthcoming memoir, The Guardian is reporting. The former first lady made the extraordinary declaration in her memoir, “Melania,” which is to be published next Tuesday. Portions of the memoir were obtained by The Guardian. “It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,” the wife of the Republican nominee wrote, amid a presidential campaign in which her husband’s threats to women’s reproductive rights have played a central role. “Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?” Melania Trump also wrote. “A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.” “Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,” Melania Trump continued. “I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.” Melania Trump has not been much of a presence during her husband’s presidential campaign, and she has rarely expressed her political views in public, which makes her pro-choice statements so remarkable, The Guardian reported. Her views put her out of step with the anti-abortion platform of her husband’s Republican party and show her opposition to the deterioration of women’s reproductive rights under him and his MAGA movement. Trump has tried to take credit for the Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade and upheld a Mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, The Guardian said. But he’s also tried to avoid the political backlash the ruling has stoked by saying abortion rights should be decided by the states. At the presidential debate last month, Trump’s Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, said, “Understand, if Donald Trump were to be reelected, he will sign a national abortion ban.” At the debate, Trump tried to sidestep the issue by denying the claims of his running mate, J.D. Vance, who said that former president would veto a federal ban. Trump said it was a “lie” that he would sign such a veto, explaining there was no reason to sign a ban “because we’ve gotten what everybody wanted.” But on Tuesday night, Trump said he would veto a federal abortion ban. While Vance was debating Harris’ running mate, Tim Walz, Trump wrote in an all-caps post on social media, “Everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it, because it is up to the states to decide based on the will of their voters (the will of the people!)” But it’s hard to know whether to take Trump at his word on the matter of a national abortion ban, HuffPost reported. In addition to boasting about his role in reversing federal abortion protections, after nominating three conservative justices to the Supreme Court, he also once endorsed punishing women who get abortions with jail time. Moreover, he has surrounded himself with some of the most extreme anti-abortion advocates in politics, HuffPost said. That includes Vance, who has called for federal restrictions on traveling for abortion care and advocated for the surveillance of women’s menstrual cycles to prevent them from getting abortions.","summary":"'Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?' the former first lady writes, as her husband campaigns for president on an anti-abortion platform.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/10/02/melania-trump-declares-pro-choice-views-in-new-memoir-report/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/GettyImages-2161997579.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:21:23","author":"Martha Ross","authors":["Martha Ross"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.039},{"id":258268694,"title":"Evidence detailed in Trump election subversion case","text":"A US judge has made public a court filing in which federal prosecutors laid out their evidence accusing former US president Donald Trump of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat. The 165-page filing on Wednesday is likely the last opportunity for prosecutors to detail their case against Trump before the November 5 election given there will not be a trial before Trump faces Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris. The filing lays out a sweeping account of Trump’s conduct following the 2020 election, much of which has already been made public through news reports, findings from the House committee that investigated the Capitol riot or the indictment obtained by Smith in the case. It includes an allegation that a White House staffer heard Trump tell family members that “it doesn’t matter if you won or lost the election. You still have to fight like hell”. It also alleges that on January 1, 2021, Trump told his vice president, Mike Pence, that people “are gonna hate your guts” and “think you’re stupid” if he didn’t use his role presiding over the January 6 congressional certification of the election result to benefit Trump. Trump has pleaded not guilty to four criminal charges accusing him of a conspiracy to obstruct the congressional certification of the election, defraud the US out of accurate results and interfere with Americans’ voting rights. Prosecutors working with Special Counsel Jack Smith divulged their evidence to make the case that the remaining allegations against Trump survive the US Supreme Court’s ruling that former presidents have broad immunity from criminal prosecution for official actions taken as president. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung blasted the disclosures, saying, “This entire case is a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.” Trump has dismissed this case and multiple other criminal prosecutions he faced this year as politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power. The filing provides details of conversations with senior officials in Trump’s administration including Pence and White House chief-of-staff Mark Meadows, who appeared before the grand jury during the investigation. Prosecutors submitted the court filing on Thursday, but US District Judge Tanya Chutkan had to approve proposed redactions before it was made public. Trump’s lawyers opposed allowing Smith to issue a sweeping court filing laying out their evidence, arguing it would be inappropriate to do so weeks before the election. They have argued the entire case should be tossed out based on the Supreme Court’s ruling. If Trump wins the election, he is likely to direct the Justice Department to drop the charges.","summary":"A US judge has made public a court filing in which federal prosecutors laid out their evidence accusing former US president Donald Trump of illegally trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat.

The Dan Air plane landed at Birmingham International Airport shortly before 8.40pm, having departed from Beirut and stopped off in Bucharest, Romania, on its journey. David Lammy confirmed the flight on Monday just hours before Israel announced the start of a 'localised and targeted' ground operation in southern Lebanon. As of last week, there were thought to be between 4,000 and 6,000 UK nationals, including dependents in Lebanon. Further flights are planned for Thursday and over the coming days. While a separate scheduled Middle East Airlines service also already brought Britons back to the UK. The Dan Air plane touched down at Birmingham International Airport shortly before 8.40pm Smoke rises following an Israeli military strike, in Kafr Kila village, southern Lebanon The foreign secretary said: 'The first charter flight taking British nationals out of Lebanon has now departed. We have arranged another flight for tomorrow, and further flights over the coming days for as long as there is demand and it is safe to do so.' He also previously added: 'The situation in Lebanon is volatile and has potential to deteriorate quickly. The safety of British nationals in Lebanon continues to be our utmost priority.

It is vital that you leave now as further evacuation may not be guaranteed.' Defence Secretary John Healey met military personnel preparing for a potential evacuation of Britons from Lebanon. He also thanked RAF personnel involved in the operation to protect Israel as it came under attack from a barrage of Iranian missiles. Two Typhoon fighter jets, supported by a tanker aircraft, were involved in the operation although the Ministry of Defence said that because of the nature of the attack, which involved ballistic missiles, 'they did not engage any targets'. The MoD said the aircraft 'played an important part in wider deterrence and efforts to prevent further escalation'. There are concerns in Whitehall that further military activity by Israel could result in the closure of the airport, cutting off the most straightforward exit route for the estimated 4-6,000 British nationals in Lebanon.

I have every confidence in our ability to do the job if required. 'But for now our government advice to all Brits in Lebanon is get out now.' He added that the importance of being able to get Britons out of Lebanon had been made clear to the Israeli government. 'It's vital that we as nations, if we have to, are able to get our nationals out of Lebanon safely,' he said. 'Israel understand that, they understand that well, and we will continue to make that case.' The Israeli military has warned people to evacuate around 50 villages and towns across southern Lebanon as its activities continue.

Mr Healey said he had spoken to his Israeli counterpart, Yoav Galant, to assure him the UK offered 'steadfast' support but to say that 'our big concern is to avoid this conflict spiralling into a wider regional war'. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, in Brussels for talks with European Union chiefs, said: 'We do need to pull back from the brink and to encourage all parties to find a way to de-escalate and for a political solution to the very many fronts of the crisis in the Middle East.'

The former first lady shockingly writes that she’s ‘carried this belief’ for her ‘entire adult life’. The Guardian has obtained a copy of her book ‘Melania’, which will be released Tuesday and tells how she holds starkly different views on abortion than her husband, former President Donald Trump, and the current Republican nominee. ‘It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,’ the former first lady writes. ‘Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes,’ she continues. ‘Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,’ she says. ‘I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.’ This eyebrow-raising admission comes as just one month before her husband battles it out in the presidential election with Democratic nominee Kamala Harris, with abortion rights set to be one of the most decisive issues among voters. Harris has framed herself as the ‘pro-choice’ candidate, while Trump has struggled to find a clear position on abortion. As president, he was widely credited for helping to pave the way for the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that federally gave women a right to an abortion. Trump appointed three of the conservative justices who voted in 2022 overturn Roe. While that decision has been cheered by the anti-abortion wing of the Republican Party, the former president has realized that the GOP has found itself imperiled over that stance. Since the 2022 ruling, Democrats have had a succession of election wins by campaigning on the issue. It is thought that Republicans underperformed during the 2022 midterms becuase of abortion. In August, Trump exclusively told DailyMail.com that he might vote to end Florida’s draconian six-week abortion ban when it comes up in a referendum later this year. However, he has avoid committing to using the presidential veto if a nationwide federal ban were to arrive on his desk as president, saying instead that it will be up to states to decide their own laws. In her memoir, Melania writes that ‘occasional political disagreements between me and my husband’ are ‘part of our relationship,’ adding that she believes in ‘addressing them privately rather than publicly challenging him.’ Later in the book, she explains why she’s supportive of abortion rights. ‘I have always believed it is critical for people to take care of themselves first,’ she said. ‘It’s a very straightforward concept; in fact, we are all born with a set of fundamental rights, including the right to enjoy our lives.’ ‘We are all entitled to maintain a gratifying and dignified existence,’ she continued. ‘This common-sense approach applies to a woman’s natural right to make decisions about her own body and health.’ Floridians are being asked to vote ‘yes’ to overturn the six-week limit. ‘I want more than six weeks,’ he said at Mar-a-Lago. I think six weeks is a mistake.’ Days later he said he would vote ‘no’ on the referendum instead, after his comments irritated anti-abortion activists in his party. More recently, Trump finally said he would veto a federal abortion ban. He did so in the middle of Tuesday’s vice presidential debate, after refusing to clarify his position during last month’s presidential debate. His rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have pushed that if Trump is allowed back in office abortion rights could be gone nationwide. Trump posted to Truth Social that ‘everyone knows that I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it, because it is up to the states to decide based on the will of their voters (the will of the people!)’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMelania Trump explosively reveals in her forthcoming memoir that she supports a woman&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Melania Trump expresses support for abortion rights in a surprising revelation in her revealing book first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/melania-trump-expresses-support-for-abortion-rights-in-a-surprising-revelation-in-her-revealing-book/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/1727910745_rewrite-this-title-Melania-Trump-defends-abortion-rights-in-extraordinary.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:14:56","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.292},{"id":258267940,"title":"Debate revealed Tim Walz to be a fraud ‘everyman’ — and a lightweight","text":"If Donald Trump wins this election, the postmortems on Kamala Harris’ campaign should put her choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate at the top of her list of mistakes. Much of America got to know Walz for the first time during Tuesday’s vice-presidential debate. Unlike his appearance at the Democratic National Convention, the Walz we saw on the debate stage didn’t have his words written for him in a teleprompter. And the unfiltered version underscored a very obvious fact about the governor: He is patently fake. For starters, how about this “Coach Walz” nonsense, which he broached yet again on Tuesday. Let’s be real, being an assistant volunteer coach isn’t exactly something to brag about. Walz always leaves out the “assistant volunteer” part of the title, to make himself out to be the second coming of Vince Lombardi. Then there was Walz’s goofy ’80s-sitcom-dad shtick that’s meant to be endearing and relatable but is as cringe as one of Kamala’s fraudulent accents. Just check out his answer to the question about why he’s claimed to be in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square protests when he was actually in Nebraska. “I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community. I’ve tried to do the best I can, but I’ve not been perfect,” he said. “And I’m a knucklehead at times, but it’s always been about that.” How comforting to know a self-described knucklehead could be one heartbeat away from controlling the nuclear codes. This filibuster of an answer went on for a full two minutes without addressing why he had lied about being in China at that critical moment, prompting co-moderator Margaret Brennan to press him for an actual response. “Governor, just to follow up on that, the question was, can you explain the discrepancy?” she asked. “No,” he said. “All I said on this was . . . I got there that summer and misspoke on this, so I will just, that’s what I’ve said.” Ah, he misspoke. Who among us hasn’t made such a flub, stating we were in Asia when we were actually on the other side of the world? The phony lied — just like he lied about serving in war zones when in reality he ditched his National Guard unit when it was about to be deployed to Iraq. Walz’s closing statement was a doozy that underscored his fundamental fakery. “Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward. She’s bringing us a politics of joy,” he said with a straight face. “She’s bringing real solutions for the middle class.” It was truly stunning to hear this lame used-car-salesman patter as Walz tried to convince us that the sitting vice president, whose administration is responsible for this disastrous economy, is the change candidate “bringing us a new way forward” while we all bask in her “politics of joy.” Kamala has been in office for more than 1,350 days, yet we’re supposed to pretend the Biden-Harris administration never happened. Walz was chosen primarily for his Midwestern, regular-guy appeal, which the Democratic brain trust was sure would win the loyalty of blue-collar men in key swing states. Harris can’t win without the Rust Belt, hence Walz’s berth on the ticket — even though she had the option of popular Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. But a pre-debate New York Times/Siena poll deflated that expectation: Walz, it turns out, is struggling in the heartland. He’s seen favorably by just 44% of voters in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, for example; in Ohio, that number drops to 41%. And men haven’t flocked to his side: A CBS poll taken before the debate found that Walz is seen favorably by 58% percent of women, but only 48% of men. Acting silly and effeminate will do that. After hiding from the press for weeks, Tim Walz had an awful night on Tuesday — so it may be the last most voters see of him before Election Day. That’s what happens when you get exposed as being as phony as a $3 bill.

Although the surveys show former President Donald Trump trailing by less than the margin of error, Cook Political Reporter now lists Harris as ahead in a multi-candidate field in Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Trump still maintains a slight — within the margin of error — lead in Georgia. Overall, Cook says Harris leads Trump 49% to 48% in a head-to-head matchup, and by 49% to 47% in a field that includes third-party options. “Underneath the topline numbers, though, there have been some significant shifts, most notably Trump’s slipping advantage on his two strongest issues — inflation and immigration,” Cook wrote of their poll. The Vice President, according to the pollsters, hasn’t escaped her own downward trends in support. Cook found Independents now lean left by just a two-point margin, down from an eight point split found in August. Despite the shift among Independents, for the first time this election cycle most voters think the Democratic party will retain the White House, according to Cook. “A plurality of swing state voters now think that a Democrat will win the presidential election. This month, 46% of voters think Harris will win, compared to 39% who think it will be Trump. That represents an 11-point swing in Harris’ favor since August, and suggests that Harris has been successful in presenting herself as a serious candidate, while Trump’s attempts to portray her as unable to do the job have not been effective,” they wrote. If Cook’s polling proves accurate — and Trump doesn’t slip in any other battleground jurisdictions — Harris could take the electoral college 303 to 235. A candidate needs 270 electors to win the White House. An Economist/YouGov national poll of more than 1,200 likely voters also released on Wednesday found Harris up by three points in a multi-candidate field, within the 3.1-point margin of error. A Susquehanna Polling and Research survey of 1,001 likely voters shows the Vice President ahead by five points, just outside that poll’s 3.2% margin. Morning Consult’s massive weekly national survey of more than 11,000 likely voters showed the same rightward shift among Independents found by Cook, but it also found that isn’t enough to put Trump ahead. “Harris leads Trump by 5 percentage points among likely voters, 51% to 46%, matching her advantage last week. Trump has seen a bit of an improvement in his numbers among independent likely voters, while Harris’ position is bolstered by some of her best numbers to date among those who voted for President Joe Biden in the 2020 election,” they wrote.","summary":"Cook Political Reporter now shows the Vice President ahead of the 45th President in six of seven swing states.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/10/02/polls-show-tight-presidential-race-even-as-harris-takes-slight-swing-state-lead/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Election_2024_77988_4774cd.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:10:12","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.141},{"id":258267524,"title":"If cheater and alleged abuser Doug Emhoff is the new face of masculinity, the Dems are up a creek","text":"If Doug Emhoff is the new face of masculinity, I’ll take a hard pass. Give me the Marlboro Man, or anyone who was in a Gillette ad before the razor company decided to lecture America about the inherent crappiness of males. Or someone who hasn’t been accused of forcefully slapping their girlfriend in public — even as he’s heralded as the biggest lift-up-the-ladies dude since Jerry Springer played the Masculine Feminist on “Married with Children.” Just three days ago, in an MSNBC interview, Jen Psaki gushed over the feminism of Kamala Harris’ husband, telling Emhoff that he “reshaped the perception of masculinity” and was a “wife guy.” Emhoff shamelessly said that he was always that way: “It’s the right thing to do … women should not be less than.” That is, unless that lady’s story gets in the way of the left’s empty “believe all women” narrative. Psaki, a former Biden administration flack, made no mention of Emhoff allegedly impregnating his kids’ nanny in 2009 while he was married to his first wife, Kerstin Emhoff. Now, Harris and her media lapdogs are predictably silent as it is alleged that, in 2012, Emhoff slapped an ex-girlfriend so hard that she spun around. The disturbing claims were reported by the Daily Mail, which spoke to three friends of the alleged victim, a New York executive Emhoff reportedly dated for three months. The pair were attending a gala during the Cannes Film Festival when he allegedly assaulted her because he thought she was flirting with a valet. Friends, who provided detailed documents to back up the pair’s trip, claimed the woman slapped him back and that he forced his way into her cab. They broke up that night but, sources claimed, Emhoff did not apologize. He has also not yet denied the claim or issued any public statement. Pretty dark stuff. Especially since he’s made the rounds boasting of his enlightened views on female empowerment. “This is something I have thought about a lot, I’ve spoken about a lot,” he told Jonathan Capehart — again, on lib-friendly MSNBC — in 2023. “There’s too much of toxicity — masculine toxicity out there, and we’ve kind of confused what it means to be a man, what it means to be masculine. You’ve got this trope out there where you have to be tough, and angry, and lash out to be strong.” Yikes. We’ve been informed by Oprah, crowing at the DNC, that “decency and respect are on the ballot in 2024.” It’s not very decent to hit a lady. And Harris, given her professedcommitment to female victims of abuse, should be outraged by these dark revelations. As should all the A-list ladies who cheer her: women like Julia Roberts, Taylor Swift, Jennifer Lopez and Meryl Streep, who famously called Harvey Weinstein “God.” Remember the endless think pieces on toxic masculinity after Christine Blasey Ford accused then Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school? Though she couldn’t remember a time or place, nor establish that she and Kavanaugh actually knew each other, it did not stop the media from attempting to cast him as an unredeemable monster. Many women in the media wore black to support Blasey Ford. Actors like Allison Janey, Kerry Washington and Debra Messing walked off their Hollywood sets. One of the women who took part in that performative social media event? Then Senator Kamala Harris. “Wore black today in support of all survivors of sexual assault or abuse. We won’t let them be silenced or ignored. #BelieveSurvivors,” she posted. No one is wearing the dark shade of mourning today. There are no hashtags. No outrage. Joy still reigns. Emhoff is still brat. A quick Google search for the Second Gentleman produces nary a mention of this alleged assault. Most media has ignored it. Politico has nothing about it, but has tweeted a piece opining that J.D. Vance’s beard “can be negative, conveying aggression and opposition to feminist ideals.” Hey, at least Emhoff didn’t use the violent phrase “childless cat ladies.” And to anyone who says, “but he’s not the one running for office”: If Nancy “Just Say No” Reagan had secretly hosted coke parties, we would have cared. Supporting females is Emhoff’s entire personality. Admittedly, Trump has his own baggage and accusations, as we’re reminded daily, but he makes no claim to a moral high ground. If you’re going to build your political identity on being the party of women believing women and supporting victims, find a consistent line. Not just when it’s politically expedient. Otherwise, the hashtag shouldn’t be #BelieveWomen. It should be #BelieveWomenOnOurSide.","summary":"The left insists we should believe all women — but that seems to be an empty narrative when it comes to abuse allegations against Kamala Harris' husband.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/opinion/if-doug-emhoff-is-the-new-face-of-masculinity-no-thanks/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/screen_shot_2024-10-02_at_4.51.24_pm_720.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=720","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:03:53","author":"Kirsten Fleming","authors":["Kirsten Fleming"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.202},{"id":258267308,"title":"Donald Trump's Loses Advantage on Top Economic Issue, New Poll Shows","text":"Donald Trump has lost his lead over Kamala Harris over which candidate is best placed to tackle inflation, while a lower proportion of Americans think the economy is getting worse, according to the latest Cook Political Report Swing State Project Survey. For the survey, 2,941 voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin were polled by BSG and GS Strategy Group between September 19 and 25. In a head-to-head contest, the study found Harris has a wafer-thin 1-point lead over Trump, with 49 percent of the vote against the Republican candidate's 48 percent.\"Harris has a lead within the margin of error in Arizona (+2), Michigan (+3), Nevada (+1), Pennsylvania (+1), and Wisconsin (+2). Trump is ahead 49% to 47% in Georgia, and the two candidates are tied at 49% in North Carolina,\" the poll said.Trump received a major boost this week when a series of polls released on Tuesday suggested he is on course for victory in the key swing states of Arizona, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia, though one did put him behind in Michigan. On Wednesday, Trump became the favorite to win November's election, according to Betfair, a leading bookmaker, following the vice-presidential debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz the previous evening.According to the latest Cook Political Report survey, Trump has a 5-point lead in the swing states over which candidate would be best to deal with the economy, with 50 percent support versus 45 percent for Harris. This is the same figure as in the last Cook Political Report Swing State poll conducted in August.However, Trump's lead on which candidate would be best at dealing with inflation evaporated over the same period, with the two rivals tied at 47 percent each, according to the latest poll. By contrast, in August, Trump lead on the issue by 6 points with 48 percent support against 42 percent for Harris. Some 60 percent of swing state voters said inflation is the part of the economy that \"concerns them the most,\" demonstrating the significance of this shift.In further bad news for Trump, who has made combatting inflation one of his key campaign priorities, the proportion of swing state voters who think the economy is \"getting worse\" has fallen since May.In the September survey, 46 percent of those polled said the economy is either getting better or staying the same, against 54 percent who said it is getting worse. By contrast, Cook Political Report surveys of swing states in August and May found 57 percent and 62 percent of voters respectively thought inflation was getting worse.The latest Cook Political Report said: \"Today, the gap between those who think inflation is getting better or staying the same and those who think it's getting worse is eight points — a 17-point decrease in economic pessimism over the last four months.\"And, while Trump is winning the 35% of voters who think the economy is getting 'a lot worse' by more than 50 points, Harris is holding her own with those who think inflation is 'getting a little worse' (42% to 55% for Trump), and leads Trump among the 46% of voters who think inflation is getting better or staying the same.\"Newsweek contacted representatives of the Donald Trump and Kamala Harris presidential election campaigns for comment via email.A recent study by polling guru Nate Silver found 12 states have shifted more towards Harris over the past month, against seven that have moved more in Donald Trump's direction.","summary":"Swing voters no longer think Donald Trump is the best candidate to tackle inflation according to a new survey.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trumps-loses-advantage-top-economic-issue-new-poll-shows-1962987","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2486213/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 23:01:39","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":258269332,"title":"Walz embarks on debate cleanup bus tour, taking shots at Vance he failed to land on stage","text":"A day earlier, Vance and Walz engaged in a civil debate on substance, in which the two men often found agreement in an attempt to appeal to swing state independent voters. Debate experts widely gave Vance higher marks for his smooth delivery and ease during the debate, whereas Walz stumbled out of the gate and didn’t make the case against former President Donald Trump until the end of the first and only showdown between the vice presidential candidates. But Wednesday, as part of a broader media blitz, Walz didn’t hesitate to go on the offense against Vance, accusing Trump’s running mate of trying to mislead voters on the former president’s record. “You can’t rewrite history,” Walz told a crowd at the York Exposition Center’s UPMC Arena. “Trying to mislead us about Donald Trump’s record, that’s gaslighting. That’s gaslighting.” “‘Donald Trump tried to save Obamacare.’ Are you kidding me? He spent his entire presidency trying to eliminate it,” he said. After his arrival in nearby Middletown earlier Wednesday, Walz spoke with reporters at Harrisburg International Airport about his past misstatements regarding being in China during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre when he was in Nebraska. In one of the most viral moments of his debate with Vance, Walz admitted to being a “knucklehead” who sometimes misspeaks. “Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong,” he said, saying he “was in Hong Kong in China” in August of 1989. “It was profound for me — that was the summer of democracy,” he said. Walz also addressed his other mistake from the debate, in which he said he had “become friends with school shooters” in an answer about gun control instead of the loved ones of school shooters’ victims. “I need to be more specific on that, but I am, I am passionate about this,” he said on the matter of gun violence. “I speak like everybody else speaks.” In Michigan, another blue-wall state, Vance also took a more aggressive approach and dinged his opponent for the school shooter gaffe. “That was probably only the third- or fourth-dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night,” Vance said Wednesday, telling a crowd in Michigan he did not notice the remark in real-time. The Harris campaign has been spinning Walz’s performance as a win, contending the audience saw the governor’s authenticity compared to Vance’s slickness. The campaign has already clipped the election question moment for an ad called Vance’s “damning non-answer.” As part of his post-debate Pennsylvania bus tour, Walz underscored pressing Vance on whether Trump won the 2020 election, to which the senator replied he was looking to the future not the past. “I was speaking to the American people last night,” he said. “It felt especially in that moment for me that Sen. Vance was speaking to an audience of one.” In contrast to Tuesday, Walz criticized Vance’s gun policy positions and the senator’s scrutiny of the moderators for fact-checking him. Walz, who entered the arena on his bus, started by acknowledging the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Vice President Kamala Harris was also scheduled to be in York on Tuesday but ended up traveling to Georgia to assess the storm damage and the federal government’s response. Walz’s bus tour, which features Sen. John Fetterman (D-PA), a former President Joe Biden supporter, as a special guest, will also stop in Reading. Walz’s more aggressive post-debate travel will include rallies, smaller events, fundraisers, and targeted interviews in Arizona, California, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Washington. His media engagements will range from two national TV interviews, a late-night appearance, and sit-downs with sports content creators and podcast hosts.","summary":"YORK, Pennsylvania — Gov.

Biden landed in Greer, South Carolina, where he was met by South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster, U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham and North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper, among others, before boarding Marine One for an aerial tour of the region. From the helicopter, Biden could see the grim devastation brought to parts of North Carolina, including Asheville and Chimney Rock. Over the Asheville metropolitan area, homes were smashed to bits, with the damage greatest near rivers, reporters in a trailing helicopter observed. Many of the people living in the area remained cut off from contact with the outside world, even as the U.S. president passed overhead. In Asheville’s River Arts District, set alongside the French Broad River, the receding floodwaters left behind chaos. Rescuers continue to scour the state’s mountains for survivors. “You can see homes that have moved clearly from one side of the river down the river to another side,” Biden said in Raleigh, North Carolina, before an operational briefing. “And I can only imagine what it’s like to have been in one of those homes.” “It’s going to cost billions of dollars to deal with this storm and all the communities affected,” Biden said. Harris, meanwhile, was briefed in Augusta, Georgia, alongside Georgia Senator Jon Ossoff and Representative Rick Allen. She joined Augusta Mayor Garnett Johnson to survey the city’s Meadowbrook neighborhood. “There is real pain and trauma that has resulted because of this hurricane and what has happened in terms of the aftermath of it,” Harris said, adding that she had spoken with a community member whose daughter lost her husband. “We are here for the long haul,” Harris said. “There’s a lot of work that’s going to happen.” Rebuilding will be extremely costly and take years, U.S. officials say. Former President Donald Trump, a Republican running against Harris in this year’s presidential election, has falsely claimed that Biden, a Democrat, has been unresponsive to the hurricane’s destruction, an allegation local officials deny. “In a moment like this, we put politics aside,” Biden said in Raleigh. “There are no Democrats, Republicans, there are only Americans. And our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can.” Before leaving Washington, Biden directed up to 1,000 active-duty troops to help with response and recovery efforts. Almost 6,000 members of the National Guard are deployed across the six states affected by the storm, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said. Search-and-rescue teams have conducted nearly 1,500 structural evaluations and hundreds of rescues and evacuations, Mayorkas said. Biden also approved on Wednesday requests from Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and North Carolina’s Cooper for federal funds for debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months and six months, respectively. Biden will head to Georgia and Florida on Thursday, White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre said. Harris will travel to North Carolina in the coming days. More than $10 million has been provided directly to those affected by the storm, Jean-Pierre said. Over 4,800 personnel from across the federal workforce have been deployed to help in recovery efforts, along with 8.8 million meals, more than 7.4 million liters of water and 150 emergency power generators, said Mayorkas. Still, the Homeland Security secretary said federal funding may not be enough should another hurricane hit. “We are meeting the moment, but that doesn’t speak about the future,” Mayorkas said. “We are expecting another hurricane hitting. … FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.” North Carolina and Georgia are among seven key battleground states in the Nov. 5 election, which is expected to be won by thin margins. Harris now leads Trump by 2.6 percentage points in national opinion polls, according to aggregator FiveThirtyEight. North Carolina election officials are scrambling to make sure the state’s over 7 million registered voters can cast a ballot in federal, state and local elections. Earlier this week, Trump visited Georgia. Presidents and presidential candidates usually do not visit a storm-hit region immediately because of fears they will distract from rescue efforts and divert resources from local law enforcement officials and emergency responders. Hurricane Helene slammed into Florida on Thursday as a powerful Category 4 hurricane before tearing a destructive path through Southeastern states for several days.","summary":"Biden toured parts of North and South Carolina while Harris visited Georgia, as the administration responds to a storm that has killed over 160 people.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/10791422/hurricane-helene-biden-harris-visits/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/CP173255955-e1727909394375.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:55:42","author":"Globalnews Digital,Reuters","authors":["Globalnews Digital","Reuters"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.332},{"id":258269838,"title":"Former Trump national security aides endorse him amid turmoil overseas","text":"WASHINGTON — A group of national security experts led by Cabinet members from the Trump administration endorsed former President Donald Trump on Wednesday, citing his foreign policy record and calling him \"a peacemaker.\" The group, organized by former Trump national security adviser Robert O'Brien and former National Security Council chief of staff Alex Gray, wrote in a letter that \"securing peace\" is \"the legacy of Trump.\" The signers, numbering more than 300, include former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, who ran against Trump in this year's Republican primaries, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and former National Intelligence Director John Ratcliffe. The letter comes amid an escalating conflict in the Middle East between Iran and Israel, as well as Russia's war in Ukraine. Trump recently compared the Middle East conflict to a \"schoolyard fight\" and said he would negotiate a deal \"that's good for both sides\" in the Russia-Ukraine war. Shortly before the letter was released, federal prosecutors led by special counsel Jack Smith argued in a 165-page filing that many of Trump’s actions in the wake of his loss are not subject to a recent Supreme Court decision granting broad immunity to presidents for official acts. Prosecutors say Trump and co-conspirators, working in their private and campaign capacities rather than in service of official duties, illegally tried to block Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 election. One of the signers of Wednesday's letter was former Attorney General William Barr, who last year called the Jan. 6 prosecution a \"legitimate case.\" \"There was very grave wrongdoing here,\" Barr told PBS at the time. \"And I think it’s reasonable to say that it falls within the obstruction of a proceeding.\" The former national security officials did not mention the Jan. 6 case in their letter, but it offers a counterpoint to critics who contend that Trump's behavior put the nation at risk. They wrote that President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have failed to keep the country safe. \"The policies of the Biden-Harris Administration have invited conflict, diminished America’s standing around the globe, and imperiled our national security,\" the letter says. \"Over the last four years, peace throughout the world has been upended by America’s emboldened adversaries.\" A person familiar with the effort to collect signatures and write the letter, which refers to the Sermon on the Mount and “the Judeo-Christian principles upon which our nation was founded,” said it proves Trump would be able to fill a new administration with top-quality aides. \"This letter shows the establishment and the left are woefully inaccurate in saying the president would not attract top talent in term two,\" the person said.

JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota jumped back on the campaign trail with stops in two crucial battleground states. As he arrived at the airport near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Wednesday, Walz pointed toward his debate hours earlier with Vance and told reporters, \"New York City was a little crazy last night.\" Most pundits said Vance was the more polished of the two candidates on the vice presidential debate stage Tuesday night, although flash polls indicated debate watchers were mostly divided on which running mate was victorious. An accidental response by Walz during the debate quickly went viral, as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate mistakenly said he had \"become friends with school shooters.\" 2024 CASH DASH: TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE AS HE TRIES TO CLOSE GAP WITH HARRIS The mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports. \"I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I’ve become friends with school shooters. I’ve seen it,\" Walz said. Asked to clarify his debate gaffe, Walz said Wednesday, \"I'm super passionate about this. The question came up about the school shooting. We're talking about everything except school shootings. And I sat as a member of Congress with the Sandy Hook parents, and it was a profound movement. \"David Hogg [a leading gun control activist and school shooting survivor] is a good friend of mine.\" VANCE, WALZ, SPAR OVER ISSUES AT VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN Walz acknowledged \"I need to be more specific on that.

Walz admitted he traveled to Asia in August 1989, several months after the April 15 massacre, adding he can be \"a knucklehead at times.\" The governor on Wednesday reiterated that he had his \"dates wrong.\" Trump, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News' Brooke Singman, called his running mate's performance \"fantastic\" and that it had \"reconfirmed my choice.\" The former president also argued that Walz had \"embarrassed himself\" during the debate. Another major moment in the debate came near the end, when Vance wouldn't say that President Biden won the 2020 election over Trump. The former president for four years has repeatedly made unproven claims that the election was rigged and rampant with voter fraud. Walz, on Wednesday, once again emphasized that \"it is disqualifying to not acknowledge that the 2020 election was won by Joe Biden. It's as simple as that.\" An hour later, speaking to a large crowd at a rally at the York Fairgrounds, Walz charged that \"you can't rewrite history. And trying to mislead us about Donald Trump's record. That's gaslighting.\" Vance, asked about his avoidance of answering the 2020 election question during the debate, reiterated his charge on Wednesday that \"the simple reason\" is that \"the media is obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago. I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to commonsense, economic policies.\" Walz arrived at his rally in York to cheers as he pulled into the York Exposition Center riding his campaign bus. But York is Trump country. The former president won York County by roughly 25 points over Biden in 2020.

Vance has done dozens of interviews and repeatedly fielded questions from reporters on the campaign trail since Trump named the senator as his running mate 2½ months ago. Vance made the first of his two stops in Michigan in Auburn Hills, at Visioneering, an automotive industry tool supplier. Auburn Hills is in Oakland County, which has swung heavily toward the Democrats in recent election cycles. Biden carried the county by roughly 14 points over Trump four years ago. Michigan and Pennsylvania are two of seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Trump or Harris win the 2024 presidential election.

Walz later explained that he meant to refer to those affected by gun violence, not the gunmen. Vance kept returning to his debate against Walz as he delivered his remarks, relitigating everything from their answers on the economy to what Vance called government “censorship.” He again defended Trump’s economic agenda as based on “common sense” after Walz appealed to the economists suggesting his plans would cause inflation. “I don’t think those economists know what the hell they’re talking about,” Vance told rallygoers, saying the topic “really annoyed the hell out of him” on Tuesday night. Wednesday’s event marked a return to the rhetorical sniping that had become commonplace on the campaign trail. Vance spent most of his attention on Vice President Kamala Harris, but he used the debate to take fresh digs at Walz, who he has previously accused of distorting his military record. “I gotta be honest. I feel a little bad for Gov. Walz, and the reason I feel bad for him is he has to defend the indefensible,” Vance said of Harris’s record as vice president. The lion’s share of Vance’s remarks were on the car industry, claiming Harris wants to “impoverish a generation of Michigan auto workers” with the transition to electric vehicles. But the Q&A portion of the event was preoccupied with Vance’s own debate performance. One reporter asked why he declined to answer whether the 2020 election was stolen on Tuesday night as Trump regularly claims. “The media is obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago.

The agency is being stretched as it works with states to assess damage from Hurricane Helene and delivers meals, water, generators and other critical supplies. The storm struck Florida last week, then plowed through several states in the Southeast, flooding towns and killing more than 160 people. Mayorkas was not specific about how much additional money the agency may need, but his remarks on Air Force One underscored concerns voiced by President Joe Biden and some lawmakers earlier this week that Congress may need to pass a supplemental spending bill this fall to help states with recovery efforts. “We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,\" Mayorkas said. “FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.\" Hurricane season runs June 1 to Nov. 30, but most hurricanes typically occur in September and October. Congress recently replenished a key source of FEMA's response efforts, providing $20 billion for the agency's disaster relief fund as part of a short-term government spending bill to fund the government through Dec. 20. The bill also gave FEMA flexibility to draw on the money more quickly as needed. Both chambers of Congress are scheduled, however, to be in their home states and districts until after the election, as lawmakers focus on campaigning. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave no hint he was considering changing that schedule during a speech Tuesday. He said that Congress just provided FEMA with the funds it needs to respond and that lawmakers would make sure those resources are appropriately allocated. A bipartisan group of Senators from affected states wrote their leadership this week saying it’s clear Congress must act to meet constituents’ needs. They said that may even require Congress to come back in October, ahead of the election. Mayorkas made his comments as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris fanned out across the Southeast to witness the damage from the hurricane and seek to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia. More than 150,000 households have registered for assistance with FEMA, and that number is expected to rise rapidly in the coming days, said Frank Matranga, an agency representative. The devastation was especially severe in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where at least 57 people died in and around Asheville, North Carolina, a tourism haven known for its art galleries, breweries and outdoor activities. “Communities were wiped off the map,” North Carolina’s governor, Roy Cooper, said at a news conference Tuesday.","summary":"Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says the agency tasked with helping communities recover from Hurricane Helene and other natural disasters does not have enough money to make it through the hurricane season","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/alejandro-mayorkas-ap-fema-joe-biden-mike-johnson-b2622963.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/23/Biden_98530.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:39:48","author":"Kevin Freking","authors":["Kevin Freking"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":258266586,"title":"FACT FOCUS: Claims that more than 300,000 migrant children are missing lack context","text":"By MELISSA GOLDIN Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have recently claimed that hundreds of thousands of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied are missing, then criticized the border policies of the Biden administration and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, repeated the claim during Tuesday night’s debate. “We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,” he said as he met Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in what is likely the last debate of the 2024 presidential campaign. But immigration experts say the claims regarding missing migrant children lack significant context. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: The Biden administration has lost more than 300,000 unaccompanied migrant children. THE FACTS: This claim misrepresents information in an August report published by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General, which faulted Immigration and Customs Enforcement for failing to consistently “monitor the location and status of unaccompanied migrant children” once they are released from federal government custody. The report noted that more than 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children had not, as of May 2024, received a notice to appear in court. Additionally, more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children got a notice to appear but then failed to show up for immigration court hearings. Those figures came from ICE and covered a period from October 2018 to September 2023. During that period there were a total of 448,820 unaccompanied children released by ICE to the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Refugee Resettlement. But experts say it is a stretch to refer to roughly 300,000 children as “lost” or “missing.” “This is not a ‘missing kids’ problem; it’s a ‘missing paperwork’ problem,” Jonathan Beier, associate director of research and evaluation for the Acacia Center for Justice’s Unaccompanied Children Program, wrote in an email. Plus, President Joe Biden only entered the White House partway through this period. It includes approximately 15 months when Trump was president and does not specify how many children arrived in the U.S. under each president. Experts say there are many reasons why the children might not have appeared for hearings or received a notice to appear in the first place. For example, they only get a notice to appear when removal proceedings against them have begun, and if ICE hasn’t started that removal process, they wouldn’t have gotten a notice in the first place. A lack of communication between government agencies could mean a notice is sent to the wrong address if it has been updated with one agency and not another. A child’s guardian may be unable to take them to court, perhaps because they live on the other side of the state. The report does not provide any explanations. “All of these factors can explain some of the deficiencies and a conclusion that the children are missing could be very, very premature,” said Raul Pinto, deputy legal director for transparency at the American Immigration Council. “We are concerned that the report’s findings are misleading and may be misconstrued because they fail to acknowledge key facts,” she said. Hills said ICE does not generally issue court notices to unaccompanied children “until after they have been placed with sponsors who have been vetted by HHS” so that they can get settled and seek legal help. Representatives for HHS and Vance did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. An unaccompanied migrant child is defined by the U.S. government as someone who is under 18, lacks lawful immigration status and has no parent or guardian in the country to take custody of them. When they’re apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security, they’re transferred to the HHS’s Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed “in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interests of the child,” according to the resettlement office. That can mean shelters, foster care or residential treatment centers, among other options. If possible, children are released to sponsors, often family members, who can care for them. Removal proceedings may be initiated by ICE and the Department of Justice. Some children are able to stay in the U.S. legally if they qualify for asylum, special visas for victims of abuse, trafficking and other crimes, or other types of immigration relief. In those cases, removal proceedings may never start. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.","summary":"Immigration experts say the claims regarding missing migrant children lack significant context.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/10/02/fact-check-missing-migrant-children-claim/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Election_2024_Debate_23251.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:38:53","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.479},{"id":258266596,"title":"FACT FOCUS: Claims that more than 300,000 migrant children are missing lack context","text":"By MELISSA GOLDIN Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have recently claimed that hundreds of thousands of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied are missing, then criticized the border policies of the Biden administration and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

Polling by the Cook Political Report Swing State Project, released on Wednesday, shows Harris has closed a six-point gap on the issue, which Trump led her on in August. Back then, the former president led Harris on inflation and cost of living 48 percent to 42 percent. The latest figures show that voters are evenly divided, with both candidates taking 47 per cent. The issue of inflation is an issue that 60 per cent of swing state voters say is the aspect of the economy that “concerns them the most,” according to Cook, which offers independent, non-partisan political analysis. Among the explanations suggested by Cook are that Harris’ message on the economy has finally broken through, having honed in on an “affordability” message that stresses reducing the costs of pharmaceutical drugs, cracking down on price gouging and promoting affordable housing. Another is that the Trump campaign’s attempts to link her to “Bidenomics” and the role the Biden Administration’s economic policy played in driving up the cost of living have not been as effective as Republicans had hoped. Cook Political editor in chief Amy Walter noted: “Underneath the topline numbers, though, there have been some significant shifts, most notably Trump’s slipping advantage on his two strongest issues — inflation and immigration. “However, Harris has seen some slippage of her own: as her lead among independent voters has shrunk from eight points this summer to two points in September.” The survey shows that Trump continues to lead the economy and holds the same five-point lead on the question on who voters trust to “deal with the economy” as he did in August – 50 percent to Harris’ 45 percent. However, the data showed that voters give Trump only a three-point lead on a centerpiece of his economic agenda — tariffs and trade. Walter also noted that younger voters and their opinions on the economy may end up being a critical unanswered question as to who wins the election in November.","summary":"Polling by the Cook Political Report Swing State Project, released on Wednesday, shows the Democrat has closed a six-point gap on the issue, which her Republican rival led her on in August","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/harris-trump-polling-voters-inflation-b2622945.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/20/EEUU-ELECCIONES-CIBERSEGURIDAD_18313.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/SsrUfkE3-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:37:24","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.123},{"id":258265930,"title":"Harris says she won’t ban fracking","text":"PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Vice President Kamala Harris said she won’t ban fracking natural gas, telling KDKA-TV that her position hasn’t changed since she joined the Biden ticket in 2020. As a senator back in 2019, Harris once said she would ban fracking, which is the method used to extract the natural gas the Pittsburgh region uses to heat homes and factories. The Trump campaign insists that is still Harris’ view, so in her first television interview with a Pittsburgh station since announcing her candidacy for president, KDKA-TV’s Jon Delano repeated one campaign ad and asked her directly. “The ad claims that if you are elected president you will ban fracking and cost Pennsylvania over 300,000 jobs. Have you changed your view on fracking, and if so, why?” Delano asked. “So let me start by saying that that ad as you described it is absolutely a mischaracterization which I think is intended to make people afraid,” Harris replied. Harris said her view today is the same as in 2020 when she joined the Biden ticket. Biden said repeatedly in that campaign that he would not ban fracking, a position repeated by Harris. “I will not ban fracking. I did not as vice president. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to open up more fracking leases,” Harris said. “And my perspective on this is grounded in a number of things, including that we don’t have to ban fracking to do the work that we can do to also invest in a clean energy economy.” And the vice president took direct aim at campaign ads claiming otherwise, calling them intentionally misleading. “I’m going to bring jobs back to rural communities. I’m going to make sure that we invest in those communities that have done the kind of work that you have in mind when you talk about Pittsburgh, when you talk about the greater aspect of Pennsylvania. And I’m going to keep doing that work,” she said. And while she obviously had a different view five years ago, the vice president is adamant she will not ban fracking. “That’s where I stand, period. As president of the United States, I will not ban fracking,” she said. Despite her strong and clear words on the issue, it’s not likely to stop the Trump campaign from insisting her earlier views on fracking are her real ones, leaving it up to voters to decide who’s telling the truth.","summary":"Harris says she won&#8217;t ban fracking in an exclusive KDKA-TV interview Harris says she won&#8217;t ban fracking in an exclusive KDKA-TV interview 02:55 PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Vice President Kamala Harris said she won&#8217;t ban fracking natural gas, telling KDKA-TV that her position hasn&#8217;t changed since she joined the Biden ticket in 2020.  As a senator &#8230;\n\n\nThe post Harris says she won&#8217;t ban fracking appeared first on WorldNewsEra.","url":"https://worldnewsera.com/news/politics/harris-says-she-wont-ban-fracking/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/10/02/82dff210-8b93-4b00-b46a-e708071971d4/thumbnail/1200x630/4340501e742ff5a0a10b6da6426a9b6c/snapshot-2024-10-02t174224-286.jpg?v=0736ad3ef1e9ddfe1218648fe91d6c9b","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:36:01","author":"Cathy Biank","authors":["Cathy Biank"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":258267722,"title":"Dakota Fanning reveals the 'super-inappropriate questions' she was asked as a child star - after making screen debut age six","text":"Home News Royals U.S. Sport TV Showbiz Femail Health Science Money Travel Podcasts Shopping Best Buys Discounts My Profile Logout Login Headlines Showbiz Kim Kardashian Victoria Beckham Harry Styles Amanda Holden Britain's Got Talent My Profile Logout Login Privacy Policy Feedback Wednesday, Oct 2nd 2024 1AM 7°C 4AM 6°C 5-Day Forecast Advertisement NHS worker mother-of-three, 37, was raped 'again and again until she died' while unconscious on a park bench after night out, court hears Melania Trump DEFENDS abortion rights in extraordinary revelation that goes against husband Donald's policies just one month before Presidential election Laura Kuenssberg reveals how embarrassing gaffe saw Boris Johnson interview scrapped Man, 34, who contacted GP SIX times during Covid lockdown before he got face-to-face appointment died of cancer three days later - then his heartbroken father killed himself I'm living the Bulgarian retirement dream: We have TWO homes, get better healthcare, enjoy hot summers and ski in the winter... all for an incredibly cheap cost of living DAN HODGES: Mysterious talks between Lord Alli and Syrian dictator Assad that beg the question - who the hell IS this guy?

The 30-year-old actress, who rose to fame after starring in the 2001 movie I Am Sam, recalled a number out uncomfortable interviews with journalists, who she said asked her uncomfortable things like how she planned on 'avoiding becoming a tabloid girl.' 'People would ask super-inappropriate questions,' the performer told The Cut. 'I was in an interview as a child and somebody asked, 'How could you possibly have any friends?' It's like, \"Huh?\"' While nodding to stars like Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Drew Barrymore, Fanning said she has a 'lot of compassion for people who have been made into examples.' 'If society and the media hadn’t played their part, who knows? I don’t think that it’s necessarily connected a hundred percent to being in this business; there are other factors, too,' she explained. Dakota Fanning admitted that she is still blown away by the 'super-inappropriate' questions that she was asked as a child star; seen last month Read More Tom Cruise has given Dakota Fanning shoes for EVERY BIRTHDAY since War of the Worlds came out She went on to praise her loved ones for always having her back and supporting her through the process. 'My family is comprised of very nice, kind, protective people,' she said. 'I have a mother who taught me how to treat other people and also how to treat myself. And she was there every second. I was always treated with respect.' On set, she said she was fortunate to always be 'respected as an actor and as equal.' 'Looking back on my life, my career is such a present part of it, but I really think about the childhood memories, too. My life doesn’t feel disproportionate with work, and I’m so grateful for that. I’m there doing work that matters,' she raved. When asked about the trope of the fallen child actor by the publication, Fanning admitted, at times, she has wondered: 'Is that what you want to happen to me somehow? Is that what you want to happen to these people? I’ve definitely felt this kind of vibe from people almost wanting me to fail or something.' 'It makes you feel a little bit guarded. I’m just living my life over here. I think also I was just a little too young for it to fully hit me,' she continued. 'People couldn’t get away with that kind of thing so much anymore. By the time I got to that age, it was sort of being recognized as probably not the best way to treat people.' Later in the interview, she reflected on how different the media was in 'the early 2000s.' 'It’s crazy the way it was totally normal then to discuss someone’s cellulite,' she marveled. 'It was outrageous then, obviously, but now it’s just unacceptable, so I’m happy that doesn’t happen as much anymore. I mean, there are still pressures, different pressures, but I think there’s more freedom to just be a f**king person.' The 30-year-old actress, who rose to fame after starring in the 2001 movie I Am Sam, recalled a number out uncomfortable interviews with journalists, who she said asked her uncomfortable things like how she planned on 'avoiding becoming a tabloid girl' (pictured in 2005) 'People would ask super-inappropriate questions,' the performer told The Cut. 'I was in an interview as a child and somebody asked, 'How could you possibly have any friends?' It's like, \"Huh?\"' (seen with Brittany Murphy in 2003) As for what advice she would give her younger self, Fanning said: 'I don’t look back and have any regrets.' 'I’m pretty happy with who I was then,' she explained. 'I never let public perception or any of that stuff really influence the choices that I made, and I just tried to stay true to myself. I’m pretty proud of my past self.' In 2019, she previously told PorterEdit that she 'made mistakes... but privately.' 'The difficult part about starting so young, which I've totally come to accept, is that when you grow up and become a woman, people think you're younger,' she noted. Dakota, who has starred in more than 44 movies since the age of six, revealed that turning 21 'felt like a weight had been lifted' because there was such huge pressure for the star 'not to mess up' in the public eye. While nodding to stars like Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Drew Barrymore, Fanning said she has a 'lot of compassion for people who have been made into examples' (seen in 2024) She said: 'Turning 21 for me was really freeing. Before that, things could be scary… I would go to a gala dinner and all the glasses would already be filled with wine and I'd hold one up for a toast and [people would say], she's drinking wine! 'No, I wasn't! Stupid little things like that. I mean, I had been to bars and clubs when somebody was having an afterparty for a premiere, but I'd never snuck in. 'I'd never gone anywhere I wasn't supposed to go. I felt there was such an expectation for me not to mess up. Which could have driven me crazy, because that's an outrageous thing to put on a younger person, who's supposed to make mistakes. 'And I certainly have made mistakes, but just privately. When I turned 21, I felt like a weight had lifted; I felt more freedom to come into my own.' In 2019, she previously told PorterEdit that she 'made mistakes... but privately' Dakota, who has a slew of movie roles under her belt including playing the younger version of Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama, admitted her parents never pressured her to pursue acting. She said: 'I've known that I wanted to act since I was six. But I was never made to do anything. […] That's why I hate when people insinuate that I was pushed to do something.'

The 30-year-old actress, who rose to fame after starring in the 2001 movie I Am Sam, recalled a number out uncomfortable interviews with journalists, who she said asked her uncomfortable things like how she planned on 'avoiding becoming a tabloid girl.' 'People would ask super-inappropriate questions,' the performer told The Cut. 'I was in an interview as a child and somebody asked, 'How could you possibly have any friends?' It's like, \"Huh?\"' While nodding to stars like Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Drew Barrymore, Fanning said she has a 'lot of compassion for people who have been made into examples.' 'If society and the media hadn’t played their part, who knows? I don’t think that it’s necessarily connected a hundred percent to being in this business; there are other factors, too,' she explained. Dakota Fanning admitted that she is still blown away by the 'super-inappropriate' questions that she was asked as a child star; seen last month Read More Tom Cruise has given Dakota Fanning shoes for EVERY BIRTHDAY since War of the Worlds came out She went on to praise her loved ones for always having her back and supporting her through the process. 'My family is comprised of very nice, kind, protective people,' she said. 'I have a mother who taught me how to treat other people and also how to treat myself. And she was there every second. I was always treated with respect.' On set, she said she was fortunate to always be 'respected as an actor and as equal.' 'Looking back on my life, my career is such a present part of it, but I really think about the childhood memories, too. My life doesn’t feel disproportionate with work, and I’m so grateful for that. I’m there doing work that matters,' she raved. When asked about the trope of the fallen child actor by the publication, Fanning admitted, at times, she has wondered: 'Is that what you want to happen to me somehow? Is that what you want to happen to these people? I’ve definitely felt this kind of vibe from people almost wanting me to fail or something.' 'It makes you feel a little bit guarded. I’m just living my life over here. I think also I was just a little too young for it to fully hit me,' she continued. 'People couldn’t get away with that kind of thing so much anymore. By the time I got to that age, it was sort of being recognized as probably not the best way to treat people.' Later in the interview, she reflected on how different the media was in 'the early 2000s.' 'It’s crazy the way it was totally normal then to discuss someone’s cellulite,' she marveled. 'It was outrageous then, obviously, but now it’s just unacceptable, so I’m happy that doesn’t happen as much anymore. I mean, there are still pressures, different pressures, but I think there’s more freedom to just be a f**king person.' The 30-year-old actress, who rose to fame after starring in the 2001 movie I Am Sam, recalled a number out uncomfortable interviews with journalists, who she said asked her uncomfortable things like how she planned on 'avoiding becoming a tabloid girl' (pictured in 2005) 'People would ask super-inappropriate questions,' the performer told The Cut. 'I was in an interview as a child and somebody asked, 'How could you possibly have any friends?' It's like, \"Huh?\"' (seen with Brittany Murphy in 2003) As for what advice she would give her younger self, Fanning said: 'I don’t look back and have any regrets.' 'I’m pretty happy with who I was then,' she explained. 'I never let public perception or any of that stuff really influence the choices that I made, and I just tried to stay true to myself. I’m pretty proud of my past self.' In 2019, she previously told PorterEdit that she 'made mistakes... but privately.' 'The difficult part about starting so young, which I've totally come to accept, is that when you grow up and become a woman, people think you're younger,' she noted. Dakota, who has starred in more than 44 movies since the age of six, revealed that turning 21 'felt like a weight had been lifted' because there was such huge pressure for the star 'not to mess up' in the public eye. While nodding to stars like Lindsay Lohan, Britney Spears, Paris Hilton and Drew Barrymore, Fanning said she has a 'lot of compassion for people who have been made into examples' (seen in 2024) She said: 'Turning 21 for me was really freeing. Before that, things could be scary… I would go to a gala dinner and all the glasses would already be filled with wine and I'd hold one up for a toast and [people would say], she's drinking wine! 'No, I wasn't! Stupid little things like that. I mean, I had been to bars and clubs when somebody was having an afterparty for a premiere, but I'd never snuck in. 'I'd never gone anywhere I wasn't supposed to go. I felt there was such an expectation for me not to mess up. Which could have driven me crazy, because that's an outrageous thing to put on a younger person, who's supposed to make mistakes. 'And I certainly have made mistakes, but just privately. When I turned 21, I felt like a weight had lifted; I felt more freedom to come into my own.' In 2019, she previously told PorterEdit that she 'made mistakes... but privately' Dakota, who has a slew of movie roles under her belt including playing the younger version of Reese Witherspoon in Sweet Home Alabama, admitted her parents never pressured her to pursue acting. She said: 'I've known that I wanted to act since I was six. But I was never made to do anything. […] That's why I hate when people insinuate that I was pushed to do something.'

They must be brain dead if they do,” Biden jabbed. “Scientists report that with warming oceans powering more intense rains, storms like Helene are getting stronger and stronger — they’re not going to get less, they’re going to get stronger. Today in North Carolina, I saw the impacts of that fury.” At least 189 people have died from the storm across six states, with at least 70 of those deaths recorded in North Carolina alone. A further 100 residents of the state are unaccounted for. The remark about Biden’s political adversaries being “brain dead” quickly sparked an outcry — after the president himself took criticism for what residents say has been a slow emergency response in the hardest-hit areas. Former President Donald Trump’s campaign tweeted sarcastically: “Biden — the uniter-in-chief — says Americans ‘must be braindead’ if they ‘deny’ the hurricane damage is because of climate change.” “Comatose and cognitively declined Joe Biden is calling Americans like me brain dead. This is a joke, Right?” reacted conservative commentator Leo Terrell. Biden has come under fire for his management of the storm — including the fact that he monitored the initial days of the devastation impacting the Southeast from his Delaware beach house. The president bristled at such criticism Monday when questioned by an Associated Press journalist about whether he should have commanded the federal response from the White House. “It’s called a telephone!” Biden chided. The president also has had to walk back his initial claim Sunday that no further resources were needed to respond to the storm — saying at his Wednesday afternoon briefing with Cooper that Congress will have to approve more funding. “It’s going to cost billions of dollars to deal with this storm… and Congress has an obligation to ensure states have the resources they need,” Biden said. The outgoing president visited North Carolina and South Carolina on Wednesday while Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee in the Nov. 5 election, visited storm-hit Augusta, Ga. Harris, who was on a West Coast campaign swing over the weekend, has also taken criticism from Republicans, including for tweeting an image of herself addressing the crisis from Air Force Two — wearing headphones that weren’t plugged into her phone — and for forgoing annual hurricane preparedness briefings that were a staple of her predecessor Mike Pence’s calendar. “The people in western North Carolina feel let down, deservedly so,” Rep. Chuck Edwards (R-NC), whose district includes some of the worst-impacted areas, told NewsNation Monday. “The response has been disappointing,” Edwards said. “We’ve begun to see some resources brought in today, but the storm was over about 80 hours ago. The storm was over about 10 a.m. Friday. We knew that the storm was coming and only today are we beginning to see the first FEMA employees and trailers and helicopters come in.”","summary":"The outgoing president visited North Carolina and South Carolina on Wednesday while Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee in the Nov. 5 election, visited storm-hit Augusta, Ga.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/us-news/biden-says-people-must-be-brain-dead-to-doubt-climate-crisis-fueled-hurricane-helene/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/president-joe-biden-walks-off-90910673.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/8vjJqkuU-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:32:20","author":"Steven Nelson","authors":["Steven Nelson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":258266470,"title":"FACT FOCUS: Claims that more than 300,000 migrant children are missing lack context","text":"Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have recently claimed that hundreds of thousands of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied are missing, then criticized the border policies of the Biden administration and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, repeated the claim during Tuesday night’s debate. “We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,” he said as he met Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in what is likely the last debate of the 2024 presidential campaign. But immigration experts say the claims regarding missing migrant children lack significant context. Here’s a closer look at the facts. CLAIM: The Biden administration has lost more than 300,000 unaccompanied migrant children. THE FACTS: This claim misrepresents information in an August report published by the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of the Inspector General, which faulted Immigration and Customs Enforcement for failing to consistently “monitor the location and status of unaccompanied migrant children” once they are released from federal government custody. The report noted that more than 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children had not, as of May 2024, received a notice to appear in court. Additionally, more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children got a notice to appear but then failed to show up for immigration court hearings. Those figures came from ICE and covered a period from October 2018 to September 2023. During that period there were a total of 448,820 unaccompanied children released by ICE to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. But experts say it is a stretch to refer to roughly 300,000 children as “lost” or “missing.\" “This is not a ‘missing kids’ problem; it’s a ‘missing paperwork’ problem,” Jonathan Beier, associate director of research and evaluation for the Acacia Center for Justice’s Unaccompanied Children Program, wrote in an email. Plus, President Joe Biden only entered the White House partway through this period. It includes approximately 15 months when Trump was president and does not specify how many children arrived in the U.S. under each president. Experts say there are many reasons why the children might not have appeared for hearings or received a notice to appear in the first place. For example, they only get a notice to appear when removal proceedings against them have begun, and if ICE hasn't started that removal process, they wouldn't have gotten a notice in the first place. A lack of communication between government agencies could mean a notice is sent to the wrong address if it has been updated with one agency and not another. A child’s guardian may be unable to take them to court, perhaps because they live on the other side of the state. The report does not provide any explanations. “All of these factors can explain some of the deficiencies and a conclusion that the children are missing could be very, very premature,” said Raul Pinto, deputy legal director for transparency at the American Immigration Council. Carmen Hills, an ICE spokesperson, said the agency agreed with the inspector general’s recommendations to improve information sharing within ICE and externally with HHS, but disagreed with the suggestion that the children are missing. “We are concerned that the report’s findings are misleading and may be misconstrued because they fail to acknowledge key facts,” she said. Hills said ICE does not generally issue court notices to unaccompanied children “until after they have been placed with sponsors who have been vetted by HHS” so that they can get settled and seek legal help. Representatives for HHS and Vance did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press. An unaccompanied migrant child is defined by the U.S. government as someone who is under 18, lacks lawful immigration status and has no parent or guardian in the country to take custody of them. When they're apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security, they're transferred to the HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement. They are then placed “in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interests of the child,” according to the resettlement office. That can mean shelters, foster care or residential treatment centers, among other options. If possible, children are released to sponsors, often family members, who can care for them. Removal proceedings may be initiated by ICE and the Department of Justice. Some children are able to stay in the U.S. legally if they qualify for asylum, special visas for victims of abuse, trafficking and other crimes, or other types of immigration relief. In those cases, removal proceedings may never start. ___ Find AP Fact Checks here: https://apnews.com/APFactCheck.","summary":"Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have recently claimed that hundreds of thousands of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied are missing","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/kamala-harris-ap-immigration-and-customs-enforcement-jd-vance-donald-trump-b2622959.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/10/02/23/Election_2024_Debate_23251.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:29:55","author":"Melissa Goldin","authors":["Melissa Goldin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.491},{"id":258266238,"title":"Melania Trump’s Surprising Stance on Abortion Rights Revealed in Her Memoir","text":"Former first lady Melania Trump reveals in a forthcoming memoir that she supports a woman’s right to choose. Trump shockingly says she’s ‘carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.’ The Guardian obtained a copy of her book Melania, which will be released Tuesday, and reported Wednesday that she holds very different views on abortion than former President Donald Trump, the current Republican nominee. ‘It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,’ the former first lady wrote. ‘Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?’ she asked. ‘A woman’s fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.’ ‘Restricting a woman’s right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,’ Trump said. ‘I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life,’ she added. The eyebrow-raising admission comes after she says in the book that ‘occasional political disagreements between me and my husband’ are ‘part of our relationship.’ ‘[B]ut I believed in addressing them privately rather than publicly challenging him,’ she said. Later in the book she explains why she’s supportive of abortion rights. ‘I have always believed it is critical for people to take care of themselves first,’ she said. ‘It’s a very straightforward concept; in fact, we are all born with a set of fundamental rights, including the right to enjoy our lives.’ ‘We are all entitled to maintain a gratifying and dignified existence,’ she continued. ‘This common-sense approach applies to a woman’s natural right to make decisions about her own body and health.’ Trump has been widely credited for setting the table that allowed for the overturn of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 landmark Supreme Court decision that federally gave women a right to an abortion. The Republican nominee appointed three of the conservative justices who signed on to the 2022 Dobbs decision, killing Roe. While that was cheered on by the anti-abortion wing of the Republican Party, it was also the former president who realized that the GOP was now in political peril over that stance. Since then, abortion rights ballot initiatives have been successful and Republicans underperformed during the 2022 midterms, likely because abortion was such a hot issue. Trump has struggled to find his footing on the issue. In August he told DailyMail.com that he might vote to end Florida’s six-week abortion ban. Floridians are being asked to vote ‘yes’ to overturn the six-week limit. ‘I want more than six weeks,’ he said at Mar-a-Lago. I think six weeks is a mistake.’ Days later he said he would vote ‘no’ on the referendum instead, after his comments irritated anti-abortion activists in his party. More recently, Trump finally said he would veto a federal abortion ban. His rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have pushed that if Trump is allowed back in office abortion rights could be gone nationwide.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nFormer first lady Melania Trump reveals in a forthcoming memoir that she supports&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Melania Trump&#8217;s Surprising Stance on Abortion Rights Revealed in Her Memoir first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/melania-trumps-surprising-stance-on-abortion-rights-revealed-in-her-memoir/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/rewrite-this-title-Melania-Trump-defends-abortion-rights-in-extraordinary.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:27:09","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.271},{"id":258265536,"title":"The GOP's SCOTUS dreams: From the Politics Desk","text":"Welcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk, an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team’s latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.

Republicans eye confirming even more Supreme Court justices if Trump wins By Sahil Kapur During Donald Trump’s White House tenure, Republicans assembled the most conservative Supreme Court in a century. Now, they’re excited about the prospect of building on those efforts by confirming even more conservative justices, as well as lower-court judges, if he wins another four years. GOP senators widely expect there would be at least one Supreme Court vacancy during a second Trump term — and if he defeats Vice President Kamala Harris, Republicans would be likely to control the Senate, which handles the confirmation process. Two long-serving conservative justices will be on retirement watch in the coming years: Clarence Thomas, 76, and Samuel Alito, 74. “High — extremely high to certain,” Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who is on the Judiciary Committee, said when he was asked about the odds of Trump’s having the opportunity to appoint more Supreme Court justices if Republicans emerge victorious in the election. “I think you’ll see, on the conservative side, at least one retirement. I’m speculating, but I’m fairly confident of that,” Hawley said, adding that Republicans would probably look for more potential justices in the mold of Thomas and Alito — “particularly if we’re replacing one of those individuals.” If Trump were to get two more Supreme Court picks, he would have appointed over half the court — which no president has done since Franklin D. Roosevelt. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who is running to be the next Senate GOP leader, said: “The three we’ve confirmed has been a legacy, one of the best things the administration and President Trump did with a Republican majority. Five almost seems too much to hope for.” On the campaign trail, Harris hasn’t said much about the prospect of Supreme Court vacancies under the next president. But she has repeatedly criticized Trump for picking the three justices who were essential to the five-member majority that overturned Roe v. Wade and ruled in a case involving Trump that presidents have immunity for some official acts. Trump, who campaigned heavily on the Supreme Court in 2016, has said less about it this time as he finds himself on defense over his role in the overturning of federal abortion rights. His campaign did not respond when it was asked whether he will release another list of high court prospects to choose from if he has another vacancy to fill. Read more from Sahil → A ‘happy warrior’ VP debate leaves questions unanswered for the top of the tickets By Chuck Todd Given America’s polarization and the everyday tone and tenor of this presidential election, people would be forgiven for thinking they had accidentally stumbled upon a rerun from another era in American politics instead of the 2024 vice presidential debate. In some ways, this debate felt like a throwback to the VP debates America got used to in the pre-Trump era — essentially one-week intermissions between the first and second presidential debates. The flashback vibe I was getting the most was similar to the Dick Cheney debates of 2000 and 2004 (versus Joe Lieberman and John Edwards) or the Joe Biden debates of 2008 and 2012 (versus Sarah Palin and Paul Ryan). Going into this debate, I assumed that both vice presidential nominees would be more focused on the tops of the tickets. And for the most part, the two played to type. In just about every answer, Tim Walz went after Donald Trump and regularly looked for ways to praise JD Vance in a way that made him look anti-Trump. Vance similarly would try to throw shade at Walz by praising his empathy and concern about an issue while contrasting them with Kamala Harris’. But what was a bit surprising to me was that Walz turned out to be more aggressive against Trump than Vance was against Harris. Ultimately, the No. 1 job of the VP candidate in these debates is to make the case against the top of the ticket. So it’s quite interesting to me that the strategy Vance chose to engage in seemed designed to improve his own personal ratings. Walz’s performance was the very definition of uneven. His nervousness came through quite a bit, especially at the start. Clearly, he was telling the truth when he reportedly told Harris during the VP vetting process that debating wasn’t a strong suit for him. But Walz was strong at times when he was prosecuting a case against Trump, particularly on Jan. 6 and abortion. He was less good at defending Biden-Harris actions in general.

The candidates first: Tim Walz now stands exposed as a fantasist — one whose lies aren’t (only) about little things: He not only made up his claims to have served in combat, but about being in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre. Maybe in Minnesota you can get away with get away with bragging of being a coach — rather than assistant coach who’s unpaid because of your drunk-driving conviction. But on the national stage, compulsive deception carries major consequences — and could readily endanger the nation. And, no, Tim: There is no “hate speech” exemption to the First Amendment. Frankly, that he doesn’t seem to know that proves, all by itself, that Walz isn’t ready for prime time — and exposes Kamala Harris’ terrible judgment in picking him as her running-mate over the far-more-effective Gov. Josh Shapiro (D-Pa.). Vance, meanwhile, disproved the “weird” charge (first coined by Walz but then embraced across Dem-world): Finally handed the chance to address the whole nation, he proved charming, polite and full of common sense. And also sharp: Rightly facing down the bias of CBS moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O’Donnell, including standing up to an utterly false “fact check.” Time and again, the moderators pushed misinformation in their questions; time and again, Vance gently established the actual facts — and/or deftly pivoted to address issues the voters care about, rather than the agenda of the (smug but shockingly ignorant) media elite. To tell the truth, we expected Vance to wipe the floor with Walz; anyone who’d watched them both with any objectivity would bet that way. But most viewers were likely surprised, because the “mainstream” media haven’t been presenting the candidates honestly; it’s as if they’re treating the Harris-Walz campaign’s talking points as baseline truth. Sadly, this isn’t just a temporary result of Trump Derangement Syndrome; it’s more like the engrained bias is the cause of TDS. Most of America’s media elite (indeed, much of the US elite, period) are stuck deep in an ideological bubble — and, rather than face that fact, they strike out at anyone who challenges their complacency. How many times do they have to get mugged by reality before they wake up?","summary":"Tuesday’s veep debate was a huge eye-opener — not simply about the two candidates, but about the modern media.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/10/02/opinion/veep-debate-at-last-exposed-the-truth-about-vance-walz-and-our-hopelessly-biased-media/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/10/JDVTIMW1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:12:46","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.254},{"id":258268998,"title":"Report: Doug Emhoff Paid $80k 'Hush Money'; Was Never Prosecuted","text":"Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff reportedly paid $80,000 in “hush money” to his former nanny as part of a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) but was not prosecuted, unlike Trump. Former President Donald Trump was prosecuted in New York and convicted on 34 counts for failing to list NDA payments to porn star Stormy Daniels (a.k.a. Stephanie Clifford) as campaign expenses (he denies the affair). Democrats, including Emhoff’s wife, Vice President Kamala Harris, have referred to Trump as a “convicted felon,” referring to the New York case. Yet Emhoff, too, allegedly paid “hush money.” The UK Daily Mail revealed in August that Emhoff’s first marriage broke up because of his affair with the family nanny, whom he allegedly impregnated. The affair was hidden during Harris’s Senate and presidential campaigns. Emhoff acknowledged the affair to CNN once the story broke, but did not mention impregnating the nanny, or the fate of the child. Democrats and the media nonetheless praised Emhoff for reshaping “the perception of masculinity.” On Wednesday, the Daily Mail reported that Emhoff had “forcefully slapped” a girlfriend in 2012, which prompted her to leave him. It added that Emhoff allegedly paid the nanny a “settlement of around $80,000, and had the nanny sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).” It was not clear when the amount was paid, or over what period of time. The nanny lives in New York, where Trump was prosecuted. Emhoff divorced his first wife in 2020 and married Kamala Harris in 2014; she ran for Senate in 2015-2016. It is not clear if Emhoff also has an NDA with the alleged victim of his assault. Her story has not emerged until now, and the Daily Mail‘s sources are all the alleged victim’s friends; she herself declined to comment (as did Emhoff). Joel B.

For years, he had claimed he was there when the Chinese government violently suppressed the pro-democracy movement in June 1989. But recently it emerged that, while he was in fact in Hong Kong that year, he did not get there until August at the earliest. It is just the latest in a string of ‘misspeaks’ by Walz and psychologists tell DailyMail.com there now appears to be a pattern. Dr Christian Hart, a psychologist at Texas Woman’s University who has previously written about why politicians lie, suggested two theories for Walz’s embellishments. He said: ‘When we look at lying, we see people only lie when they believe they are going to derive something beneficial out of it. ‘If there is no potential perceived benefit, people are almost exclusively honest according to research. ‘For Walz, he may believe he gets some sort of favor out of it — whether that’s burnishing his reputation or appearing as someone who has more expertise on a topic than he actually does.’ The Minnesota governor has repeatedly said he used IVF to conceive his two children, which is in fact not true. Most recently, he made the claim at a joint rally with Kamala Harris in August, when there were concerns about the legality of IVF. He also made the claim in fundraising letters posted in April, which began with: ‘My wife and I used IVF to start a family.’ But when pressed on the claims, it turned out he had actually used intrauterine insemination, or IUI, a different treatment. In another case, Walz said in 2018 while he was running for Congress that he had used ‘weapons of war, that I carried in war’ when discussing gun regulation. But this was not true. Walz, who served in the National Guard for 26 years, was never deployed to combat or overseas — and retired from his battalion shortly before they were sent to fight in Iraq. Another theory is that Walz, who is from a tiny town in Nebraska and has been catapulted onto the national stage, is insecure and thus exaggerates his achievements so he seems more presidential. Dr Hart added: ‘One thing we also see is that people who have low self esteem tend to lie considerably more than people who are more secure. ‘It could be that he sees himself maybe not quite at the level one would expect a presidential candidate to be at, and so is making some exaggerated claims to help seem more like he is.’ During his 2006 campaign for Congress, his team claimed that his drunk driving arrest was not because of drinking, saying he had instead failed the alcohol test due to a misunderstanding related to hearing loss from his time in the National Guard. Court records show, however, he was pulled over for driving at 96mph in a 55mph zone and was then taken to a local hospital, where a test showed his blood alcohol level was 0.128 — above the legal limit of 0.1. Also in the 2006 campaign, he claimed he had received an award from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce in 1993 for his work in the business community. A blistering letter from the Chamber revealed in August and sent to the Walz campaign at the time, refuted this and said he had never received an award. Ryan Waite, vice president of public affairs at the corporate marketing firm Think Big, told DailyMail.com that there appeared to be a ‘concerning’ pattern emerging in Walz’s lies. He said: ‘I would have chalked this up to inexperience a little bit, but there is also a pattern now that is starting to get a little deeper I think.’ He said, however, that Walz didn’t appear to lie more than other politicians, although added that politicians normally learn not to make these sort of claims during the primaries process. But with Walz, he added, there were no primaries. ‘Normally, these sort of kinks would be worked out during the primaries process before hitting the national stage,’ he said. ‘But with Walz, he has been catapulted forward without the normal on ramp.’ During the debate, Walz criticised for appearing nervous and making unsual facial expressions. Body language experts also noted how at points Walz’s eyes appeared to open ‘wide as saucers’. Joe Navarro, a published author and expert on body language, told Politico it was a ‘dynamic and emphatic facial motion that grabbed the viewer’s attention’. ‘Early humans would have made such facial gestures to communicate strong emotions, like “danger is close”. ‘For Walz, it gave extra weight to his feelings and held our gaze.’ On the debate stage, Walz particularly faced heat over suggestions he had been in Tianamen square during the democracy protests. He obfuscated his response, calling himself a ‘knucklehead’ and then adding that he gets ‘caught up’ in the moment.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTim Walz was left red-faced at last night&#8217;s debate after being challenged&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Psychologists analyze Tim Walz&#8217;s untruths revealed during debate with JD Vance, shedding light on the VP candidate&#8217;s fabrications. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/health/psychologists-analyze-tim-walzs-untruths-revealed-during-debate-with-jd-vance-shedding-light-on-the-vp-candidates-fabrications/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/10/02/20/90384619-13916663-image-a-7_1727898941871.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-10-02 22:06:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.605},{"id":258264370,"title":"ABC reporter grumbles that it took '90 minutes' in the VP debate before a January 6 question","text":"It was \"striking\" to ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl that it took 90 minutes into the vice presidential debate before there was a question on Jan. 6. Karl, along with ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce, discussed the aftermath of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on \"Good Morning America\" on Wednesday. Bruce reported the Harris campaign was already attempting to capitalize on the candidates’ comments regarding the Jan. 6 Capitol protests and the 2020 election. \"Yeah, 90 minutes in, they feel that that was the moment that defined this debate. That exchange on January 6, defending the Constitution, In fact, this morning they are rushing to get out an ad on that exchange what Walz called Vance’s ‘damning non-answer,’\" Bruce said. Karl expressed his frustration that it took so long to get to the question, considering \"this is not a normal election.\" 'THE VIEW' HOST ADMITS WALZ 'DROPPED THE BALL' DURING VP DEBATE: 'WASN'T IN FIGHTING MODE' \"What was striking to me is that you had 90 minutes into this debate before you hit the fact that this is not a normal election, that Donald Trump tried to overturn the last election. And in that last answer, what you saw is JD Vance saying he wouldn’t do what Mike Pence did. He wouldn’t stand up to Donald Trump if he tried to do it again. He would help him, and he would have helped him last time overturn an American democratic election,\" Karl said. He added, \"You finally got to that at the end. But, for the first 90 minutes or so, this looked like it is simply a campaign about policy differences. And it’s really not, George. It is more than that.\" \"It is. It is absolutely stunning, the only time in American history it has ever happened,\" host George Stephanopoulos responded.

Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?\" Vance responded. Walz called it a \"damning non-answer.\" According to the Fox News Debate Dial, the dials for independents and Democratic voters dropped significantly at Vance’s answer on whether former President Trump lost the 2020 election, with independents seeing the sharpest decline.

But financial strength can often be deceiving. We’ve all seen that family with the big, beautiful home, fancy cars, designer clothes, and a country club membership. At first glance, they seem to be doing well, right? But if they’ve bought all of that with large amounts of debt, they aren’t financially secure. They are simply creating an illusion of wealth, and eventually, that catches up with them. You can’t say the economy is strong, when the fiscal foundation underneath it is full of cracks, smoke, and mirrors. That’s exactly what the U.S. government has been doing — creating the illusion of economic growth by financing it with increasing amounts of debt. From the outside, it appears as if the economy is thriving, which is why certain economists and propagandists continue to push the narrative that it’s rock-solid. However, a quick glance at the numbers tells a different story. The national debt, now nearly $35.5 trillion, is estimated to exceed 120% of GDP. Major financial entities suggest that for stability, it should be around half that amount. Under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, credit rating agencies, which are often slow to reveal the severity of fiscal crises, have downgraded the national debt rating multiple times. We are now paying more than $1 trillion per year in interest expenses, meaning the cost of financing what we’ve already “bought” exceeds what we spend on national defense. This recalls Niall Ferguson’s maxim: “Any great power that spends more on debt service than on defense will not stay great for very long.” Adding to this growing debt burden is a massive deficit. While we have historically run large deficits relative to GDP during times of war or emergency (or so-called emergencies like COVID), the Biden-Harris administration is running wartime-level deficits — around 7%-8% of GDP, which is double the historical average — during a period without a direct war and with a supposedly strong economy. The more than $2 trillion deficit becomes even more alarming when you consider that the government took in over $5 trillion in revenue in the latest fiscal year. This is not only a record amount (compared to $3.46 trillion just five years ago), but it also exceeds the GDP of every country on Earth except the United States and China. What the government is doing mirrors the extravagant family mentioned earlier — creating the illusion of a strong economy by taking on massive debt. The deficits are inflating the appearance of growth at an enormous cost. The government has also received a boost from struggling consumers, who are taking on record levels of personal debt and dipping into their savings. You can’t say the economy is strong, when the fiscal foundation underneath it is full of cracks, smoke, and mirrors. The economists then want to change the subject, looking at increasing housing prices and stock portfolios. This isn’t the strong argument that’s being presented. Asset inflation started before the rise in the cost of living. While this benefits those who hold assets, it does nothing for wage earners struggling to cover basic living expenses. All it has done is widen the gap between the “haves” and the “have-nots,” and history shows that such a divide is unhealthy. The economy isn’t working well for everyone. Where it does appear to be working, it’s happening at a massive and unsustainable cost. What happens when the Joneses can no longer keep up with themselves? It could very well collapse the global economy. We need to confront reality instead of buying in to the illusion.","summary":"Agenda-driven economists and Democratic Party mouthpieces keep repeating one claim: The economy is strong.

I’ve tried to do the best I can, but I’ve not been perfect, and I’m a knucklehead at times.” Kamala Harris chose Walz, most observers have agreed, for his Everyman aesthetic and fluency in retail politics. And so far, the affable former high-school football coach and hype man for Menards has mostly received glowing reviews. He is much more adept than his Republican counterpart, J. D. Vance, at engaging with voters as a regular guy. Which is why he should have had a better answer last night. And Walz’s failure to provide a coherent, succinct correction for an entirely predictable inquiry about one of his flubs suggests ill-preparedness for a spotlight that is only going to get brighter—and harsher—in the weeks to come. Vance delivered a slick debate performance, though it would be a mistake to call it a “win” when he engaged in so much sinister revisionist history. In what would turn out to be the most striking moment of the night, Vance refused to admit that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election. The senator from Ohio also mischaracterized Trump’s attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and Vance claimed, falsely, that he’s never supported a national abortion ban. Walz, for his part, deployed a few effective jabs. “That’s a damning nonanswer,” he said simply, after Vance’s election-denial tap dancing. Another time, in an exchange about gun-violence prevention and mental-health care, Walz looked right at the camera and said, “Sometimes it just is the guns. It’s just the guns.” But when you’re running a campaign against liars and bloviators, it becomes all the more important not to lie or bloviate. And the Walz fumble on China was sloppy enough—and early enough in the proceedings—to feel significant. After his first answer, CBS’s Brennan gave him another chance to clarify. “All I said on this was, I got there that summer—and misspoke on this,” Walz said, before taking a long pause. “So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, and from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in governance.” The bungled response made the moment worse than it needed to be. And calling himself a “knucklehead” came off more cringeworthy than charming. But it wasn’t the first time Walz has been ensnared by his own nonanswers. In August, a video surfaced on social media in which Walz referred to weapons “that I carried in war” to explain his support for an assault-weapons ban. Walz served in the Army National Guard for 24 years, but was never deployed to a combat zone. Asked about it in a sit-down interview, Walz had an exchange with CNN’s Dana Bash that followed a now-familiar pattern. “You said that you carried weapons in war, but you have never deployed, actually, in a war zone. A campaign official said that you misspoke. Did you?” Bash asked. “I speak candidly. I wear my emotions on my sleeves, and I speak especially passionately about our children being shot in schools and around guns. So I think people know me. They know who I am,” Walz said. Bash pressed. “Did you misspeak, as the campaign has said?” “I said we were talking about—in this case, this was after a school shooting—the ideas of carrying these weapons of war,” Walz replied, “and my wife, the English teacher, told me my grammar is not always correct.” Some Democrats dismiss these fumbles. “So he had a bad answer to something that happened 35 years ago. Next!” the political strategist James Carville told me. That’s right in the sense that Walz’s remarks seem more slippery than nefarious. He isn’t obfuscating, as Vance is, about the results of the 2020 election. Still, Walz’s sloppiness highlights a bigger problem with media accessibility and versatility for the Harris campaign. Both Democratic principals have been reticent, seemingly reluctant to engage with the press; lately, Walz especially has been tightly bubble-wrapped. Unlike the Republican vice-presidential candidate, Walz does not regularly appear on cable-news programs or spar with reporters at campaign events. He is out of practice, and it shows. This morning, perhaps as an attempt at post-debate cleanup, the Harris campaign announced that Walz is expanding his schedule. The governor will travel to several swing states in the next few weeks, and do a lot more media appearances, including a podcast, a late-night-TV hit, and two national-TV interviews. That will surely help Walz get in some badly needed reps.
