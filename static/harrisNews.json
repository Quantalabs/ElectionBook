James Comer, R-Kentucky, the chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, scheduled a Feb. 10 hearing featuring the governor. The announcement came several days after influencer Nick Shirley posted a video on social media alleging fraud at multiple Minnesota child care centers.\n\nIn a statement, Comer accused Walz of being \"asleep at the wheel\" while, federal prosecutors say, hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars were siphoned from a child nutrition program. The Justice Department has called it the \"largest COVID-19 fraud scheme in the country.\"\n\nAlleged fraud in Minnesota's social services programs has drawn increasing ire from the White House and congressional Republicans. On Dec. 30, the federal Department of Health and Human Services said it was pausing child care payments to the state amid the controversy.\n\nRead more: HHS freezes all childcare funding to Minnesota, citing 'blatant fraud'\n\nWalz, who has faced calls from the GOP to resign, criticized the Trump administration for politicizing what he called a \"serious issue\" and emphasized the president's own pardons of people convicted of fraud.\n\nIn a statement to USA TODAY, Walz's office said that although the governor is \"happy to work with Congress,\" the House Oversight Committee \"has a track record of holding circus hearings that have nothing to do with the issue at hand.\" His office did not confirm whether Walz had accepted the invitation to testify.\n\nAn initial hearing on the matter is scheduled for 9 a.m. on Jan. 7, according to the House Oversight Committee. Minnesota State Reps. Kristin Robbins, Walter Hudson and Marion Rarick are listed as witnesses. All three are Republicans, and more people could be scheduled to participate.\n\nEarlier in December, First Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson said that since 2018, at least half of the $18 billion paid through Minnesota's 14 Medicaid waiver programs could also be fraudulent. \n\nZachary Schermele is a congressional reporter for USA TODAY.

Trump and allies party down at Mar-a-Lago as polls plummet and he wishes misery on Republican colleagues","text":"Donald Trump will celebrate the new year alongside allies and MAGA celebrities at a fancy New Year’s Eve gala at Mar-a-Lago while the first year of his presidency comes to a close – and with 2026 promising to be a year of tumult for D.C.\n\nThe president’s annual New Year’s bash was set to kick off Wednesday evening at 7:30 at the Palm Beach manor and club owned by the president and is expected to be well-attended by the MAGA elite.\n\nWhite House officials were tight-lipped on Wednesday regarding an official guest list. In recent years, the lists have included Cabinet officials and the occasional congressional ally like Sen. Ted Cruz, who attended in 2024.\n\nThis year’s event is likely to be attended also by a new generation of MAGA insiders, including many of the wealthy CEOs and socialites who make up the new Trump-aligned social circles in Washington D.C. Those insiders include the members of Donald Trump Jr.’s exclusive Georgetown club, the Executive Branch, which hosts notables like crypto guru David Sacks, venture capitalist Chamath Palihapitiya, and the Winklevoss twins, Cameron and Tyler. FBI Director Kash Patel, known for hitting the D.C. nightclub scene since taking the job, is also very likely to be there.\n\nOther MAGA influencers like James O’Keefe, Jack Posobiec and C.J. Pearson, host of the “Cruel Kids” Halloween party in Washington D.C. attended by a few White House staffers and many younger conservative staffers in the city, are likely to be in attendance tonight as well. Pearson attended several parties at the club over the past several days, according to his Instagram. Posobiec is due to host one in February.\n\nGuests could also be on the lookout for Laura Loomer, whose presence in the West Wing felt like that of a grim reaper in 2025 as her visits typically heralded efforts to purge “disloyal” members of the administration from the White House to smaller positions at various federal agencies. Loomer tweeted that she was at a Mar-a-Lago event on Tuesday evening.\n\nA former mainstay of the Mar-a-Lago scene who attended last year’s bash could make headlines simply by showing up tonight: Elon Musk. The Tesla CEO and former DOGE chief had a rough falling out with Donald Trump this year, accusing the president (correctly) at one point of being “in the Epstein files” and breaking with the GOP on the passage of the Republican budget reconciliation package this summer after his time in the White House came to a somewhat unceremonious end. Tales of his antics and alleged ketamine usage were widespread in the press and seemingly confirmed by chief of staff Susie Wiles in an 11-interview series that published in Vanity Fair this month.\n\nBut Musk was in attendance at the club as recently as November, making his appearance Wednesday evening a distinct possibility.\n\nThe president’s family including his newest soon-to-be daughter-in-law, Bettina Anderson, are likely to be in attendance. Anderson and the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., announced their engagement on December 15, which would make her the latest MAGAworld insider to marry their way into the Trump family after sister-in-law Lara Trump did the same.\n\nMar-a-Lago will mark an outpost of resistance for MAGAworld as the president’s political landscape crumbles in Washington, D.C. The House of Representatives is heading into 2026 with a very thin margin complicated further by the impending departure of Marjorie Taylor Greene on January 5 and, more broadly, a growing feeling of resentment shared by lawmakers of all stripes in the Republican House caucus.\n\n“More explosive early resignations are coming,” one unnamed senior House Republican told the outlet last month. “It’s a tinder box. Morale has never been lower.”\n\nThis week, Trump did nothing to help that dynamic as he vetoed a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by one of the Republicans who broke with him on the Jeffrey Epstein files resolution, Rep. Lauren Boebert. The congresswoman, who vowed “this isn’t over” on Tuesday after the veto, is just one of a number of members of the president’s own party increasingly dissatisfied with the White House’s total control over the lower chamber of Congress through Mike Johnson, the Speaker known for relying on the president as his own enforcer.\n\nHe also lashed out at a Republican district attorney in Colorado who recommended against ceding to Trump’s wishes and honoring a federal pardon for Tina Peters, a former county clerk who was convicted of crimes related to the 2020 election and efforts to investigate supposed fraud in the state’s voting systems.\n\n“I wish them only the worst. May they rot in Hell,” the president wrote in a Wednesday morning Truth Social blast.\n\nHis polling continues to suffer as Americans feel the brunt of persistently high prices on many grocery items and other consumer goods, which experts continue to blame on his “reciprocal” tariff agenda and persistent trade issues with China, which threatened to blow up the U.S. soybean market this year.\n\nA Gallup poll this month found Trump’s approval – at 36 percent – to be the lowest of any president at this point in their term in 50 years.\n\nThat problem could explode for Trump in just a few days. \n\nAs 2025 comes to a close Wednesday evening, federal subsidies for Obamacare plans on the Affordable Care Act’s public exchanges are due to expire, a deadline which is set to spike premiums for many health plans on the public exchanges. The issue is likely to affect millions of Americans who purchase health care off of the Affordable Care Act exchanges rather than see it provided through their jobs, some of whom experts told The Independent earlier this year will be priced out of health care altogether.\n\nAffordability remains a top issue for Americans of all political affiliations heading into 2026, the same as it was in 2024 when Joe Biden and later Kamala Harris attempted to win four more years in the White House. Republicans, now in control of both chambers of Congress and the White House, are reportedly in deep fear of losing the House and possibly the Senate in 2026’s midterm election cycle, which is set to kick off in earnest in just a few weeks. Despite calls from the likes of Greene and moderates such as Sen. Susan Collins for their party to pass legislation addressing the impending premium spikes, the House and Senate left town unable to do so in December. \n\nThe challenge of passing a bill when Congress returns in a few days won’t be any easier.\n\nAlready Johnson and his counterpart in the Senate, John Thune, are both facing resignations from key Republicans who threaten to endanger their holds on either chamber this year. Some Republicans in hard-fought seats are still publicly undecided over running for re-election, causing further headaches. Those include Joni Ernst, whose Iowa seat could be the center of a massive battle as she will step down in 2026.\n\nOne House Republican described as a “senior” member of the caucus by Punchbowl’s Jake Sherman excoriated the White House in a text to the outlet shortly after the Thanksgiving holiday in November.\n\n“This entire White House team has treated ALL members like garbage. ALL. And Mike Johnson has let it happen because he wanted it to happen. That is the sentiment of nearly all — appropriators, authorizers, hawks, doves, rank and file,” they wrote.\n\nTrump may enter 2026 surrounded by his family and most fawning supporters, but his return to D.C. will mark a return to the cold reality of the unique challenges Republicans have set themselves up for in the new year, and the rough waters that appear to be coming up ahead.","summary":"President and MAGA influencers will gather for joyous bash as Republican power splinters and recedes in Washington","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-mar-a-lago-florida-nye-party-b2892884.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/31/18/48/President-Donald-Trump-arrives-to-greet-Ukraines-President-Volodymyr-Zelenskyy-at-his-Mar-a-Lago-clu.jpeg?crop=2550,1700,x0,y814.9&trim=814,0,674,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/TzTsQUDW-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-31 20:30:46","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.462},{"id":390422706,"title":"Dem's stunning upset in red state should have Trump 'very worried': analyst","text":"Republicans got another flashing warning sign on Tuesday night as Democrats notched another stunning electoral upset in a red state amid plummeting approval ratings for President Donald Trump.\n\nRenee Hardman scored a massive 71.5 percent of the vote in the race for Iowa state Senate — a jaw-dropping 27 points higher than former Vice President Kamala Harris managed statewide just a year ago.

Stephen A. Smith recorded an unplanned podcast late Friday evening, addressing Jason Whitlock, whom he called the \"devil in the flesh.\" Smith said that although he had promised never to mention Whitlock's name again, he felt compelled to respond to comments Whitlock made about his father on Sage Steele's podcast last week. \"Do a deep dive on Stephen A’s book and the way he went after his father in his book, as opposed to what he used to say about his father in interviews,\" Whitlock said when Steele asked him about the inconsistencies he found in Smith's 2023 memoir. \"You can go look up, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, what Stephen A said about his father — no criticism at all, mostly praise. Certainly no criticism,\" Whitlock continued. \"And then he comes out with this book where he basically says he had an absentee father, that he can’t stand his father, and that it’s all about his mother. That’s trying to put Stephen A in the feminist lane, in the ‘support of the matriarchy’ lane … he had a completely different narrative about his dad than he does now.\" Appearing in a split screen with his business partner Kevin Frazier and nephew Josh, Smith insisted he \"never spoke negatively\" about his father because his \"mother asked [him] not to.\" \"My mother’s exact words to me were, ‘Do it when I’m dead and gone. Don’t do it when I’m alive and I have to live with the words that you have to say about your father,’\" Smith said, quoting his late mother. \"What I did in speaking about my father was talk about what he did and the effect that it had on our family. I never said that I didn’t love him. I never said that I hated him. I never said any of those things. What I said was that I resented the impact that it had on our family and on my mother. But I never spoke about it because my mother always asked me to be quiet until she was dead and gone.\" In other words, Smith admitted that the version of his father’s story he tells now isn’t the one he told early in his career. So why the emergency 45-minute rebuttal? Because, as OutKick has long noted, Smith reflexively launches into emotional, rambling monologues whenever he’s under attack. His first instinct is to overcompensate or deflect attention elsewhere. Last month, Smith faced backlash from what he called the \"black community\" after questioning whether Rep. Jasmine Crockett was more interested in viral media attention than in representing her constituents. While initially claiming he wouldn’t \"back down,\" we predicted he would quickly cave. Since that prediction, Smith has: – Apologized to Crockett, calling her a \"sister.\"– Apologized to Kamala Harris and Michelle Obama for reasons unknown.– Appeared on CNN with Laura Coates, challenging anyone who thinks he’s conservative to listen to his liberal views.– Backtracked on his previous support for Trump deploying the National Guard.– Challenged LeBron James to be more supportive of black journalists.– Blamed Trump for the NBA gambling investigation, despite it predating Trump.– Suggested the Miami Dolphins unfairly fired general manager Chris Grier because he's black. It’s reminiscent of last year, when Smith cited a poll during a Fox News appearance about black male support for Trump. After the usual outrage, he launched another week-long apology tour, praising Michelle Obama and accusing white people of racism. When reached by OutKick earlier this month, Smith said he didn’t like, agree with, or respect my coverage. Unfortunately, he didn't offer specifics. After he cooled down, I left an open invitation for him to address anything I had written about him in any media format he chose. We hope he eventually agrees to a discussion. The core issue for Stephen A. Smith is that he’s trying to play too many roles at once, trying to satisfy too many different power players. At ESPN, he must placate his Disney bosses, \"the black community,\" WME, and NBA athletes. Elsewhere, he needs to continue convincing his touring partners, Chris Cuomo and Bill O’Reilly, that he’s the anti-woke centrist between their political extremes. On right-wing talk radio, Smith plays the disillusioned Democrat who's coming around on Trump. On CNN, he fans the flames about the GOP's supposed lack of respect for democracy. All the while, he understands he cannot draw the ire of the Democratic leaders, in the event he launches a campaign in 2028. Now, add the NFL to the list of groups he must appease. The NFL is in the process of acquiring a 10% equity stake in ESPN. Smith is also now a contributor to Monday Night Football, which he touted as part of his new $100 million contract. He’s well aware of how much influence the leagues have over pregame programming. As the story goes, the NBA had previously blocked ESPN from allowing Smith to appear during the Finals. Commissioner Roger Goodell, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, and Patriots owner Robert Kraft are the three most powerful figures in the NFL. Smith has already cozied up to Jones, recently sitting with him in a suite during a Cowboys game. But his recent comments likely didn’t sit well with Kraft or Goodell. Last week, Smith hosted First Take from Bethune–Cookman, a private HBCU, alongside Ryan Clark and Cam Newton. Playing to the crowd, he called white Patriots quarterback Drake Maye a \"liar\" for claiming he didn’t know Newton was on First Take. \"[Drake Maye] is a liar… First Take is the number one morning show… don’t tell me you’re an athlete and you don’t know that. Don’t tell me you’re an athlete and you don’t know that Cam Newton is on this show. You lying,\" Smith said. The outburst was popular on set but not elsewhere. Even media watchdogs criticized him for belittling the 23-year-old quarterback simply for not watching his show. \"Self-manufactured Drake Maye feud shows the biggest flaw of First Take,\" Awful Announcing wrote. Barstool founder Dave Portnoy demanded an apology: \"You call the MVP of the league a liar? Well, you owe us. Me, Drake Maye, the Krafts, all Patriots fans, an apology.\" And that’s where Jason Whitlock comes in. There’s one tried-and-true way to get back into the good graces of the sports media establishment. And that's to shift the negative attention back toward Whitlock, Clay Travis, or me. Take the former, bitter sportswriter who now pens a weekly Substack column to convince the cool kids he's on the right side of the culture war. His most-read story is a factually challenged hit piece about me. His fifth most-read is another hit piece, one about Jason Whitlock. It’s not hard to see why. Mina Kimes and Jemele Hill loved the stories and shared them with the audiences the author wants to impress. Likewise, Smith successfully deflected the attention away from his juvenile remarks about Maye by inserting Whitlock into the discussion. The same blogs criticizing Smith early last week now credit him for \"destroy[ing]\" Whitlock by calling him fat and a \"walrus.\" Just like that, Smith is the good guy again. Whitlock is the boogeyman. It’s a familiar play. Two years ago, Smith faced widespread criticism after Terrell Owens and Marcellus Wiley called out his poor treatment of his former white co-host, Max Kellerman, whom Owens previously declared \"blacker\" than Smith. In response, Smith posted a profanity-laced rant in which he branded Whitlock \"worse than a white supremacist.\" The cool kids of sports media loved Smith's attack. Now you see why Smith suddenly accused LeBron James of favoring white reporters after a BLM leader accused Smith of favoring white members of Congress.

Spoiler alert: He’s on vacation.”\n\nThis moment was clipped and shared on X Tuesday evening — and swiftly went viral, gaining 4 million views in less than 24 hours. Many were confused by Lahren’s dig, given Biden is not currently president and has withdrawn significantly from public life amid his cancer battle.\n\nOne critic responded on X, “quick question @TomiLahren what year do you think it is?” Another chimed in with, “Spoiler alert: he’s not president.” A third added, “Retired man goes on vacation. Hardly a scandal.”\n\nA fourth expressed a more biting sentiment, noting, “I’m pretty sure they call that retirement, you dumb hack.”\n\nAnother X user called out conservatives for giving Biden a hard time for doing exactly what they asked him to do: “Sleepy Joe Biden needs to retire so we can pile on to make fun of him for not working anymore.”\n\nThe irony of Lahren’s comments weren’t lost on other social media users, who pointed out that the conservative commentator was covering for Sean Hannity — who was reportedly absent for being on vacation.

It was a close election — Trump won the national popular vote by roughly 1.5 percent — yet he made gains with Latinos, Generation Z, independents and swing voters and flipped six states that Joe Biden won in 2020: Pennsylvania, Arizona, Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and Wisconsin.\n\nMoreover, Republicans retook Congress' upper chamber when three Democratic U.S. senators — Pennsylvania's Bob Casey Jr., Ohio's Sherrod Brown and Montana's Jon Tester — were voted out of office. \n\nBut a series of elections in November and December went well for Democrats, including double-digit victories in gubernatorial races in New Jersey and Virginia and landslides in three Pennsylvania Supreme Court retention elections. And Eileen Higgins became the first Democrat to win a mayoral race in Miami in 30 years. \n\nIn a listicle published on the last day of 2025, The Hill's Julia Mueller lays out five takeaways from these Democratic victories. \n\n\"This year's elections offered early signs of what to expect in next year's midterms,\" Mueller explains. \"After much of the country shifted rightward last year, Democrats got a much-needed shot in the arm with a string of impressive victories. The elections have also underscored some of President Trump's weaknesses as his party looks to hold onto both chambers of Congress next year.\"\n\nMueller's takeaways are: (1) \"Democrats find their momentum,\" (2) \"Economy sends warning signs for GOP,\" (3) \"Redistricting is major wild card,\" (4) \"Democrats are still divided,\" and (5) \"2028 primary is already underway.\"\n\n\"The economy was the top issue for voters throughout the 2025 elections, serving as a warning sign for Trump and the GOP ahead of the midterms,\" Mueller observes. \"Democrats' most high-profile 2025 winners put affordability and economic concerns at the center of their campaigns, while the president is logging some of his lowest economic approval ratings ever, recent polls show. Amid steep tariffs, high prices and cost-of-living issues, some Republicans have also raised concerns about Trump's approach to the issue of affordability, which he's dismissed in recent weeks as a Democratic 'con job.'\"\n\nMueller adds, \"Though Trump has said he'd give the economy an 'A-plus-plus-plus-plus' mark, polls suggest many Americans give him a failing grade on the issue and think he's losing the battle against inflation.\"\n\nAlthough the 2026 midterms are only a little over 10 months away, Democratic and GOP strategists are already thinking about the 2028 presidential race.\n\n\"Leading Democrats are asserting themselves on the national stage, from visits in key early voting states to cross-country book tours, as they eye potential bids to become the party's next standard-bearer,\" Mueller notes. \"California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has emerged as an early frontrunner, alongside a number of his fellow Democratic governors…. On the GOP side, Vice President Vance is widely viewed as an heir apparent to Trump, who has said the Constitution is 'pretty clear' that he could not seek a third term, despite rumors that he was considering the possibility.\"\n\nMueller continues, \"But growing fissures in the MAGA base raise questions about who might take the reins of the president's movement in 2028.

This high confidence in Vance's chances is similarly expressed on the PredictIt site as well as on the federally regulated prediction market Kalshi, which suggests Vance and Rubio have a 48% and 10% chance of securing the nomination, respectively.\n\n\"JD Vance is like Mario Andretti, and Marco Rubio and the rest of the field are like going around in go-karts at this point,\" said Enten. \"That's really what we are looking at. JD Vance is the clear, heavy favorite at this time.\"\n\nEnten noted that Vance's staggering early lead reflected in the prediction markets \"is not coming out of nowhere\" and directed CNN talking head Sara Sidner's attention to a poll conducted in October by the University of New Hampshire.\n\nRELATED: 'All in': TPUSA's Andrew Kolvet sets sights on 2028 presidential candidate after AmFest\n\n Photo by Caylo Seals/Getty Images \n\nThe poll found that among those who plan to vote in the 2028 Republican presidential primary in New Hampshire, 51% said they would vote for Vance; 9% said they would vote for Haley; 8% said they would vote for Gabbard; 5% said they would vote for Arkansas Gov.

That's 42 points ahead of the pack.\"\n\n\"There's a reason why he's such a heavy favorite in the prediction market so far, because if you win the GOP primary in New Hampshire, chances are, you're going to be the Republican nominee for president,\" added Enten.\n\nWhen asked by Sidner whether it was rare to see an early lead of this magnitude, Enten said, \"I looked back. Hitting 50% plus in the early New Hampshire polls for a non-sitting president — JD Vance is the only one.\"\n\n\"JD Vance is pulling off something historic at this time,\" continued Enten.\n\nWhile Vance's early lead is unprecedented, the last five sitting vice presidents who ran for president all became their parties' nominees.\n\nA straw poll was also taken earlier this month at Turning Point USA's annual AmericaFest, where widowed CEO Erika Kirk endorsed the vice president. \n\nBlake Neff, the producer of \"The Charlie Kirk Show,\" noted that Vance won the AmFest straw poll \"by more than Donald Trump won the 2024 one we did two years ago.\" Whereas 82.6% of respondents previously said they wanted to see Trump as the 2024 GOP nominee, 84.2% of respondents said they wanted to see Vance as their nominee in 2028.\n\nThe UNH poll that found a majority of likely GOP voters support Vance likewise found that there is a much closer race developing across the aisle.\n\nAmong those who plan to vote in the 2028 Democratic presidential primary in New Hampshire, 19% of respondents say they would vote for former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg; 15% would vote for California Gov.

Federal charges have been filed against 98 people accused of embezzlement of public funds and—as Attorney General Pam Bondi stressed on Monday -- 85 of the defendants are “of Somali descent.”\n\nFifty-seven people have already been convicted in the scheme to divert $300 million in public grants intended to distribute free meals to children—but the meals never existed, prosecutors said.\n\n“What’s happening in Minnesota is a microcosm of the immigration fraud in our system,” Vice President JD Vance posted on X. “Politicians like it because they get power. Welfare cheats like it because they get rich. But it’s a zero-sum game, and they’re stealing both money and political power from Minnesotans.”\n\nRepublican elected officials and federal prosecutors accuse local Democratic authorities of turning a blind eye to numerous warnings because the fraud involved Minnesota’s Somali community, the largest in the country with around 80,000 members. “When whistleblowers raised concerns, they were told that they shouldn’t say anything out of fear of being called racist or Islamophobic, or because it was going to hurt political constituency of the governor and the ruling party, the Democrats here,” state representative Kristin Robbins, a Republican who is running for governor, told AFP.\n\nDemocratic Governor Tim Walz—former vice president Kamala Harris’s unsuccessful running mate in 2024 -- rejects the accusation. While the case became public in 2022, prosecutors ramped it up again this year with hotly politicized revelations.\n\nAnother Republican candidate for governor, state house speaker Lisa Demuth, told AFP the case is “finally getting the attention that it’s needed.” Right-leaning YouTube content creator Nick Shirley reignited interest in the case over the holidays with a video that he claims shows daycare centers which are siphoning public money. The video—which blew up on X with 127 million views and played repeatedly on Fox News—resonated with Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) circles, who are opposed to what they deem to be overly generous social and immigration policies.\n\nThe Trump administration responded to the outcry immediately, with Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin telling Fox News that hundreds of investigators were targeting local businesses in Minneapolis. “We believe that there is rampant fraud, whether it be daycare centers, health care centers, or other organizations,” she said.\n\nAs part of the crackdown, federal health officials announced a broad freeze of funding to Minnesota and across the county. “We have frozen all child care payments to the state of Minnesota,” Health and Human Services (HHS) deputy Jim O’Neill wrote in an X post Tuesday.\n\nHHS has broad spending oversight for programs for the underprivileged, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, early education of toddlers and foster care.\n\nMinnesota congressman Tom Emmer, a leading figure in the Republican majority of Congress, called for mass “denaturalization and deportation of every Somali engaged in fraud in Minnesota,” in an X post Monday. President Donald Trump preceded Emmer’s call with similar sentiments at the end of November, when a conservative outlet claimed money embezzled in Minnesota was being used to fund Somalia’s Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda linked Islamist militant group. That accusation has since been denied by the prosecutor in the case. But the US president was quick to accuse “Somali gangs” of “terrorizing” Minnesotans and ended their Temporary Protected Status, a program that exempted Somalis from deportation to their war-torn country.\n\nA week later, Trump escalated the rhetoric, saying Somalia “stinks” and calling Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar—who is of Somali origin—“trash.”\n\nA surge in immigration raids followed those comments, creating “a dangerous atmosphere of chaos and instability that is making it harder for our police officers to keep Minneapolis safe,” mayor Jacob Frey said at the time. Democratic lawmaker Zaynab Mohamed, whose family emigrated from Somalia when she was a child, decried the Trump administration’s actions. “Trump is scapegoating a tiny piece of the population,” she said. “This is not about crime. It’s not about safety. This is about purging people like me from this country.” – AFP","url":"https://kuwaittimes.com/article/37906/top-stories/trump-admin-targets-minnesotas-large-somali-migrant-community/","image":"https://kuwaittimes.com/kuwaittimes/uploads/images/2025/12/31/341854.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 16:41:00","author":"Kuwait Times","authors":["Kuwait Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"kw","sentiment":-0.114},{"id":390355208,"title":"Bari Weiss makes pointed dig at new French citizen George Clooney after he slammed her CBS News takeover: ‘Bonjour!’","text":"Bari Weiss tried to return fire after George Clooney blasted her for “dismantling” CBS News by inviting the Hollywood superstar to tour the network’s newsroom, all while making an unsubtle swipe at his recently announced French citizenship.\n\n“Bonjour, Mr. Clooney! Big fan of your work. It sounds like you’d like to learn more about ours,” the CBS News editor in chief wrote in an email that was first obtained by The New York Post.\n\n“This is an open invitation to visit the CBS Broadcast Center, where I’m spending the holidays working to relaunch the Evening News with my colleagues,” she continued. “Tune in January 5.”\n\nThe Independent has reached out to CBS News and Paramount for comment.\n\nIn a wide-ranging interview with Variety this week, Clooney – whose father was a longtime television news anchor – railed against mainstream news organizations for capitulating to Donald Trump and paying him to settle his defamation lawsuits.\n\n“When Clooney played [Edward R.] Murrow last spring, CBS News was settling a frivolous lawsuit with Trump so that he’d approve the sale of its parent company, Paramount, to Skydance. That enraged Clooney, as did ABC News’ similar settlement with the president over a defamation claim,” Variety pointed out.\n\n“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f*** yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney declared. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\nWeeks before Trump returned to the White House for the second time, ABC News’ parent company Disney paid Trump $15 million to settle his complaint over anchor George Stephanopoulos inaccurately asserting that Trump was found “liable for rape” in the E. Jean Carroll civil case. \n\nTrump, however, had actually been found liable for sexually abusing and defaming Carroll. While legal analysts at the time told The Independent that the ABC case “would have been a close call” if it went to trial, First Amendment experts warned that the settlement could have a “chilling effect” on the free press.\n\nThis past summer, meanwhile, Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle his “meritless” defamation lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris – amid a politically fraught $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media that was approved by the Trump administration weeks later. \n\nOne of Hollywood’s most outspoken liberals, Clooney also took issue with the “MAGA-friendly” direction of CBS News since Skydance’s David Ellison purchased Paramount, which has included installing Weiss – the “anti-woke” founder of center-right Substack site The Free Press – as the news network’s leader.\n\n“Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak,” he exclaimed. “I’m worried about how we inform ourselves and how we’re going to discern reality without a functioning press.”\n\nAn “animated” Clooney, who recently portrayed legendary CBS News anchor Edward R. Murrow in the Broadway play Good Night, and Good Luck (adapted from Clooney’s 2005 film), also fumed that some journalists and media organizations have abandoned their “mission to hold the powerful to account.” This prompted him to reference a Murrow quote from the play.\n\n“‘Let’s not confuse dissent with disloyalty.’ I mean, what a beautiful, important statement about who we are at our best. But all too often we fall short,” he told Variety.\n\nSince her ascension as the head of CBS News in October, Weiss – who also sold The Free Press to Ellison for $150 million – has faced withering criticism from staffers and media observers alike over her efforts to overhaul the network. \n\nThis has included booking herself to moderate a primetime town hall with Charlie Kirk’s widow Erika Kirk, prompting network employees to label her “shallow” because it “revealed that all she really wants is to be on TV herself.” Despite the less-than-stellar ratings for the Saturday evening special, Weiss soon announced that the network would be launching a town hall and debate series called Things That Matter, with Vice President JD Vance as the first participant. \n\nIn recent days, however, Weiss has faced intense blowback over her last-minute decision to spike a 60 Minutes story on the Trump administration’s deportation of Venezuelan migrants to the notoriously violent El Salvador prison CECOT. \n\nAmid speculation that she yanked the segment due to Donald Trump’s recent anger at 60 Minutes and Ellison looking to gain the president’s approval for his hostile takeover bid of Warner Bros. Discovery, prompting the story’s reporter to accuse Weiss of making a “political” decision, Weiss could soon be facing a “revolt” among the network’s staff.\n\nThe backlash has grown so intense that former CBS News journalists are drawing up a public letter to deliver to Ellison this weekend, urging him to “send a message” to Weiss and tell her to stop interfering with 60 Minutes.\n\n“The editorial interference threatening 60 Minutes doesn't just betray journalism's core principles—it endangers the crown jewel of CBS News that has helped sustain the network financially and editorially for generations,” the letter reads.\n\nMeanwhile, according to her email to Clooney, Weiss is currently hard at work prepping for the latest reboot of the perennially third-place CBS Evening News. \n\nAfter failing in her bid to poach big-name talent from other networks to take over the nightly broadcast’s anchor chair, Weiss revealed this month that CBS Mornings co-host Tony Dokoupil – who has long been a favorite of hers – had gotten the gig. The move was not well-received among some CBS News staffers.\n\nOne staffer, for instance, described Dokoupil as a “mediocre straight white man” who only got the job because his views align with Weiss’s pro-Israel stance, while another added: “It’s an insult to the storied news giants who came before him.”","summary":"Hollywood star railed against Weiss for ‘dismantling’ CBS News since her arrival this fall while blasting news network for capitulating to Donald Trump","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/bari-weiss-george-clooney-cbs-news-b2892818.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/12/31/14/50/WeissClooney-split.jpeg?crop=2047.5,1365,x0.3,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/gmBzR63e-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-31 16:14:55","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.055},{"id":390351928,"title":"Breathtaking hypocrisy of MS NOW host Nicolle Wallace as former George W Bush aide who hailed Iraq war gloats over Joe Rogan's Trump 'flip-flopping'","text":"MS NOW's Nicolle Wallace took a bizarre victory lap around Joe Rogan and other 'manosphere' podcasters for souring on Donald Trump in recent months. \n\nThe Deadline: White House host neglected to mention her own flip-flop that saw her switch from being an Iraq War-backing aide to President George W Bush to a woke liberal TV star. \n\nAs the White House's communications director, Wallace proudly defended the disastrous 2003 conflict that killed over 4,400 US service personnel and 200,000 Iraqi civilians on a hunt for weapons of mass destruction that were never found. The conflict has also been blamed for triggering the rise of ISIS. \n\nHer attitude changed with her well-paid shift into media in 2008, but she still chided Rogan for flip-flopping.\n\n'Many people who might have associated themselves with Donald Trump, even this time last year, are already having some second thoughts and saying so publicly. It’s easy to see in the so-called manosphere,' Wallace, 53, began.\n\nShe proceeded to play a sequence of clips of Rogan, Shawn Ryan and Andrew Schulz - all of whom have had falling-outs with the President over his policies as of late - showering Trump with praise. \n\n'I want to issue a disclaimer. I’m not playing those clips because any of those men are heroic,' Wallace warned.\n\n'I’m playing those clips because all three of them contributed to Donald Trump’s victory in an important way, in a way that maybe people like me didn’t appreciate.\n\n'But they were three very influential people in the podcast space,' she went on.\n\n'Joe Rogan has the biggest podcast in the country, maybe in the world.'\n\nWallace then singled out a segment from the Joe Rogan Experience in 2024 where Rogan complimented Trump for aging well. \n\n'To go from [that], I mean, it’s- I hope he cringes as much as I did, and I’ve never even met him,' Wallace said.\n\n'I mean, in the first term, he might not have aged because he didn’t work very hard. But to listen to him talk, he doesn’t connect nouns and verbs inside sentences when he’s talking about striking other countries. \n\n'I mean, the idea that these guys sucked up to him and helped him win and now -again, I don’t know their purposes, I only see what is public-facing - can’t get far enough away from the stench of his political failures, is stunning.'\n\nWallace's remarks were the latest in a series of critiques of the administration.\n\nBack in October, she welcomed actor Jeff Daniels - star of the 1994 screwball hit Dumb and Dumber - to her show to perform a self-made song about that month's 'No Kings' protests.\n\nThat same month, she received a stern talking-to from popular radio host Charlamagne tha God, after she characterized him as a MAGA shill during the build-up to last year's presidential election. \n\nThe Breakfast Club host never endorsed Trump, just merely expressed why he was gaining traction over Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris.\n\n'And it wasn’t even just ideas. It was just, you know, stating the obvious and pointing out a lot of things that Democrats may have been ignoring, like the border, like the economy,' Charlamagne said on Wallace's podcast, adding, 'I'll never forget when MSNBC did that to me.'\n\nWallace, beforehand, suggested Republicans blindly 'fell in line' with Trump because of figures like Charlamagne and Rogan.\n\nWallace has been with MS NOW - previously MSNBC - since 2015, after a single season on The View. Before that, she penned a fictional series surrounding a female president and her two top aides.\n\nShe left the White House herself in 2006. She went on to work for the 2008 presidential campaign of John McCain, a vocal supporter of the Iraq War.\n\nThe conflict became widely unpopular in the US after it was found that the country possessed no 'weapons of mass destruction,' as the Bush Administration had previously claimed.","summary":"The Deadline White House host neglected to mention her history as one of President George W Bush's top advisers during her Tuesday spiel.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/media/article-15425031/nicolle-wallace-msnbc-joe-rogan-donald-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/31/15/105136043-0-image-a-55_1767194553707.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/12/26/289441672467036963/1024x576_MP4_289441672467036963.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-31 16:14:42","author":"Alex Hammer,Editor","authors":["Alex Hammer","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.336},{"id":390358054,"title":"Bari Weiss invites George Clooney to newsroom after he said she's 'dismantling CBS News as we speak'","text":"CBS News editor-in-chief Bari Weiss invited actor George Clooney to visit the network's newsroom after Clooney told Variety on Tuesday that Weiss was \"dismantling CBS News as we speak.\" \"Bonjour, Mr. Clooney! Big fan of your work. It sounds like you’d like to learn more about ours. This is an open invitation to visit The CBS Broadcast Center, where I’m spending the holidays working to relaunch the Evening News with my colleagues.

A representative for Clooney did not immediately return Fox News Digital's request for comment. ‘EDITORIAL INDEPENDENCE’ PETITION UNLIKELY TO FAZE PARAMOUNT CEO DAVID ELLISON AMID BARI WEISS SAGA: EX-JOURNO The \"Bonjour, Mr. Clooney\" remark in Weiss’s statement is an apparent reference to the actor and his wife recently being granted French citizenship. Clooney pulled no punches in his wide-ranging interview with Variety's Brent Lang. The actor touched on topics such as politics, President Donald Trump and the current state of the press. One issue that Clooney seemed particularly perturbed by was CBS and ABC's decision to settle multimillion dollar lawsuits with Trump, suggesting the networks should have instead said, \"Go f--- yourself.\" CBS and ABC have paid at least $16 million apiece to settle lawsuits brought by Trump. But Clooney, who has been living in France after uprooting his family to get away from the culture of Hollywood, is bothered the networks didn’t fight back. BARI WEISS SUGGESTS CECOT '60 MINUTES' PIECE SHE DELAYED WASN'T 'FAIR' IN MEMO TO STAFFERS \"If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f--- yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,\" Clooney told Variety. \"That’s simply the truth.\" \"It’s a very trying time,\" Clooney continued. \"It can depress you or make you very angry. But you have to find the most positive way through it. You have to put your head down and keep moving forward because quitting isn’t an option.\" Paramount Global and CBS agreed in July to pay a $16 million upfront sum to settle the president’s lawsuit against the network over how \"60 Minutes\" edited and released an interview with then-Democratic rival Kamala Harris in 2024. Trump’s team, which initially sought $10 billion, claimed the network’s use of edited clips from a single response about Israel constituted \"election interference.\" Trump's legal team championed the settlement as a win for media accountability and the American people. CBS, BARI WEISS FACING MOUNTING BACKLASH FROM LIBERAL CRITICS OVER YANKING '60 MINUTES' SEGMENT The same month as the settlement, the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved an $8 billion merger between Paramount and Skydance Media, putting David Ellison in charge of the newly formed company. Ellison then handpicked Bari Weiss to takeover CBS News, but Clooney isn’t a fan. \"Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak,\" Clooney told Variety. \"I’m worried about how we inform ourselves and how we’re going to discern reality without a functioning press.\" Trump’s win over CBS came on the heels of ABC's apology and $16 million settlement with Trump last December after he sued for defamation over \"This Week\" anchor George Stephanopoulos' claims on the air that the president had been held \"liable for rape.\" The jury in the E. Jean Carroll case to which he was referring had actually ruled he was liable for \"sexual abuse.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP ABC and CBS did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

'I've been here since 2017 and I haven't seen anybody down here.'\n\nOn several occasions, people inside the centres refuse to open the door to Shirley and ask for him to leave. \n\nAs Homeland Security agents flock to Minnesota for what DHS Secretary Kristi Noem called a 'massive investigation on childcare and other rampant fraud', longstanding investigations dating back to 2022 continue.\n\nFederal charges have already been filed against 98 people in Minnesota, and at least 60 have been convicted. \n\nAs Attorney General Pam Bondi stressed on Monday - 85 of the defendants accused of embezzlement of public funds are 'of Somali descent'. \n\nJoseph H. Thompson, the prosecutor conducting the investigation, said he had identified 'staggering, industrial-scale fraud' in Minnesota’s safety-net programmes. \n\nThe fraud schemes - conducted mainly by Minnesota’s Somali community - targetted state initiatives meant to feed children during Covid-19, support minors with autism, and aid those at risk of homelessness.\n\nBut prosecutors say fraudsters billed the government for social services that were never provided.\n\nFifty-seven people have already been convicted in a scheme to divert $300 million in public grants intended to distribute free meals to children - but the meals never existed, prosecutors said.\n\nThe fraudulent payouts to the 'Feeding Our Future' programme constituted the nation's costliest Covid-era scam. \n\n'What's happening in Minnesota is a microcosm of the immigration fraud in our system,' Vice President JD Vance posted on X.\n\n'Politicians like it because they get power.

Her aforementioned book about the 2024 presidential race sold well, with Politico describing it as one of the most commercially successful political memoirs of 2025.\n\nAdditionally, Harris’s book tour has done well. She has drawn fairly large crowds who tell her they are eager to see her run for president yet again. It’s the kind of thing someone who wants to wind up in the White House likes to hear.\n\nHarris is reciprocating. She announced in a text message to her supporters that she plans to be a player in the 2026 midterm elections, through her political action committee and her own ambitions to “travel, speak out and help elect Democrats. And I cannot do this alone.” \n\nThe former vice president and reigning titular head of the Democratic Party was not particularly active in this year’s off-year elections, which went well for Democrats. This time around, she aims to show Democrats that she is still an important part of their success.\n\n“Donations are going to be critical, especially before the first [Federal Election Commission] fundraising deadline ends in a few days, and we’re legally required to report what we’ve raised,” Harris wrote. “Everyone will be watching, and I hope to file a big report.”\n\nA Harris spokeswoman told Axios that her boss “will approach 2026 with the same commitment that anchored 2025 — listening to the American people, reflecting where leadership has fallen short, and helping shape the path forward beyond this political moment.” But not, of course, without “supporting efforts to win back Democratic majorities in the House and Senate.”\n\nNevertheless, Harris faces some obstacles along the way. The first will be convincing donors that she won’t once again blow through $1 billion while losing all seven battleground states and the popular vote. Money was one of the reasons Democrats anointed her at their convention in Chicago — she alone could keep all the money former President Joe Biden had raised and direct its spending — but it’s now obvious other anti-Trump contenders would have been fine financially.\n\nThere is also history. Democrats haven’t renominated a losing presidential standard-bearer since Adlai Stevenson in 1956 (he lost a second time to Dwight Eisenhower, then the incumbent president). That includes popular vote winners Al Gore and Hillary Clinton, who didn’t run again but weren’t exactly encouraged to either. \n\nLike Harris, Clinton and Gore both lost their first campaigns for the Democratic presidential nomination. But Clinton ran a highly competitive campaign against Barack Obama, the eventual nominee and winner of the 2008 presidential election. Harris didn’t quite make it to 2019 and dropped out before the first primary or caucus was held.\n\nA fellow Californian, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA), has arguably surpassed her as the 2028 Democratic front-runner. The polls vary. A survey conducted for the Daily Mail showed Harris with a 9-point lead over Newsom, winning 30% of the vote. Others show big numbers for Newsom, who is ahead by 2.2 points in the RealClearPolitics polling average. And Newsom’s win on the California redistricting ballot initiative will provide material support for the Democrats’ efforts to retake the House in the 2026 elections.\n\nTRUMP’S AFFORDABILITY CONUNDRUM \n\nIt is still quite early, and Harris is benefiting from name recognition compared to most of the rest of the possible Democratic field. She remains a cautious candidate who can be risk-averse to the point of indecision. She is said to be toying with at least her third message in as many campaigns. Her book ruffled feathers among the Democrats who may run against her in the 2028 primaries, but would also be called upon to help her if she won the nomination again.\n\nBut 2026 will give Harris her first test of continued political relevance and a way to show whether she can actually help Democrats win again.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is expected to hit the campaign trail next year, boosting down-ballot Democrats as she eyes another run for the party’s presidential nomination in 2028.

From headline-dominating controversies and feuds to viral moments that reshaped public narratives in real time, the press once again found itself at the center of the national conversation -- both reporting the story and, at times, becoming it. Here are 10 media moments and controversies that defined 2025, revealing how power, credibility and influence collided in an unprecedented era: 2025 LOOKBACK: MEDIA'S CREDIBILITY FRACTURES AGAIN AFTER BIDEN MENTAL DECLINE EXPOSED Jury finds CNN committed defamation against Navy veteran, settlement reached on punitive damages A jury found that CNN committed defamation against U.S. Navy veteran Zachary Young and was responsible for punitive damages in January after more than eight hours of deliberation. Young successfully alleged that CNN smeared him by implying he illegally profited when helping people flee Afghanistan on the \"black market\" during the Biden administration's military withdrawal from the country in 2021. Young said CNN \"destroyed his reputation and business\" by branding him an \"illegal profiteer\" who exploited \"desperate Afghans\" during a November 11, 2021, report by Alex Marquardt that first aired on CNN’s \"The Lead with Jake Tapper.\" The six-person jury ruled Young was awarded $4 million in lost earnings, $1 million in personal damages such as pain and suffering and said that punitive damages are warranted against CNN. As the jury was gearing up to determine punitive damages, 14th Judicial Circuit Court Judge William S. Henry announced that Young and CNN reached a settlement for the amount that would be awarded to the Navy veteran. The jury foreman later told Fox News Digital they were prepared to make CNN pay \"somewhere in the neighborhood of $50 million to $100 million.\" CNN said it would take \"useful lessons\" from the decision. \"We remain proud of our journalists and are 100% committed to strong, fearless and fair-minded reporting at CNN, though we will of course take what useful lessons we can from this case,\" a CNN spokesperson told Fox News Digital at the time. Marquardt left CNN in June. Paramount, CBS forced to pay eight figures, change editorial policy in settlement with President Trump Paramount Global and CBS agreed in July to pay President Donald Trump a sum that could reach north of $30 million to settle the president’s election interference lawsuit against the network. Trump was seeking $20 billion in his lawsuit against CBS over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of election interference leading up to the 2024 contest. CBS did not acknowledge any journalistic wrongdoing with the settlement. The lawsuit alleged CBS News deceitfully edited an exchange Harris had with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Bill Whitaker, who asked her why Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu wasn't \"listening\" to the Biden administration. Harris was widely mocked for the \"word salad\" answer that aired in a preview clip of the interview on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" However, when the same question aired during a primetime special on the network, Harris had a different, more concise response. Critics at the time accused CBS News of deceitfully editing Harris' \"word salad\" answer to shield the Democratic nominee from further backlash leading up to Election Day. Trump received $16 million upfront. This covered legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes, to be determined at Trump’s discretion. There was also an anticipation that there would be another allocation in the eight figures set aside for advertisements, public service announcements or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future. Sources close to the situation told Fox News Digital that CBS has agreed to update its editorial standards to install a mandatory new rule. Going forward, the network will promptly release full, unedited transcripts of future presidential candidates’ interviews. People involved in the settlement talks have referred to this as the \"Trump Rule.\" Trump yanks federal funding from NPR, PBS NPR and PBS were long lambasted by President Trump and other Republicans as a left-leaning institution that didn’t deserve taxpayer money, but after years of banter, federal funding was finally cut in 2025. Trump said he \"would love to\" remove federal funding outlets NPR and PBS during a meeting at the White House in late March – and he fulfilled that goal in July when he signed into law his roughly $9 billion rescissions package. The package included over $1 billion in cuts from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the government-backed funding arm for NPR and PBS. The clawback package teed up cuts to \"woke\" spending on foreign aid programs and public media, as Republicans finally yanked federal money in a move advocates said was long overdue. Once Trump returned to the White House, stripping public media of federal funding began to emerge as a realistic possibility after longtime NPR editor Uri Berliner spoke out about the public radio outlet in 2024 with a Free Press essay. Berliner, who detailed the \"absence of viewpoint diversity\" at the organization, criticized NPR’s coverage of Russiagate, the COVID lab leak theory and Hunter Biden’s scandalous laptop, among other issues. Amid the fallout, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., invited NPR CEO Katherine Maher and PBS News CEO Paula Kerger to testify in March about what Greene called their \"blatantly ideological and partisan coverage\" amid a debate over public funding. In her opening remarks, Maher said NPR plays an essential role in \"delivering unbiased, nonpartisan, fact-based reporting\" to Americans. Maher eventually conceded during her congressional testimony that her organization missed the mark in its lack of serious coverage of the Hunter Biden laptop story. Once Trump signed the rescissions package into law, Republicans celebrated it as a victory for cutting off the flow of U.S. taxpayer dollars to what they called \"woke\" initiatives. RURAL NPR STATIONS ‘DISAPPOINTED,’ DETERMINED TO SURVIVE AFTER RESCISSION PACKAGE ELIMINATES FEDERAL FUNDING CBS pulls plug on Stephen Colbert's liberal late-night show CBS shocked the entertainment industry in July by announcing \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert\" would be canceled and off the air in May 2026. Colbert, who transformed CBS' long-running late-night show into #Resistance television, had dedicated monologue after monologue to attacking Trump, elevating Democrats and boosting their agenda. His far-left fans were undoubtedly upset that their beloved Trump foe was being pulled off the air, accusing Paramount of bending the knee to an authoritarian. Trump rubbed it in by celebrating the move, writing on Truth Social, \"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired.\" It was the timing, however, that turned the cancellation into a controversy. Colbert had recently criticized parent company Paramount Global for settling Trump's lawsuit against the company over CBS' handling of the \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the run-up to the 2024 election. The ordeal came as a long-planned merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media, which needed approval from Trump’s FCC chair, was in its final stages. On a summer Thursday, CBS announced it would cancel \"The Late Show,\" insisting it had nothing to do with the looming ownership change. CBS said it was \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night,\" adding, \"It is not related in any way to the show's performance, content or other matters happening at Paramount.\" Later that month, the FCC approved the merger, paving the way for the deal to become official. Many critics, including top Democrats, accused the network of political motivation ahead of the Skydance merger. However, Colbert's show was reportedly losing CBS $40 million a year and had been running on a whopping $100 million budget per season. ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel briefly suspended by Disney after Charlie Kirk remarks One of the most shocking moments of 2025 came in September when Disney announced that ABC’s \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" would be preempted \"indefinitely,\" in what turned out to be a short-lived benching. On the heels of Charlie Kirk’s assassination, host Jimmy Kimmel accused conservatives of reaching \"new lows\" for allegedly trying to pin a left-wing ideology on 22-year-old suspect Tyler Robinson — even though prosecutors later reaffirmed those ties in an indictment. \"We hit some new lows over the weekend with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it,\" Kimmel said. Appearing the next day on journalist Benny Johnson's \"The Benny Show,\" Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Brendan Carr called Kimmel's comments \"some of the sickest conduct\" and suggested there were potential \"avenues\" the FCC could pursue. \"Look, we can do this the easy way or the hard way,\" Carr said at the time. \"These companies can find ways to change conduct, to take action, frankly, on Kimmel, or, you know, there's going to be additional work for the FCC ahead.\" Carr’s comments were denounced by lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, but a statement from Disney led many Americans to believe Kimmel’s time at the Mouse House was over. \"Jimmy Kimmel Live will be preempted indefinitely,\" a Disney spokesperson said in a vague statement. As a result, hundreds of protesters gathered outside Disney’s offices in Burbank, California, demanding that the network return \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" to the air. Protesters also assembled outside Kimmel’s Hollywood Boulevard studio, chanting, \"ABC bent the knee! No to the FCC!\" Many believed Kimmel had been fired, but he was reinstated the following week. He has since signed a contract extension through 2027 and said he never intended to make light of Kirk’s assassination during an emotional monologue upon his return. Bari Weiss joins CBS News as editor-in-chief, Paramount buys Free Press for $150 million Polarizing journalist Bari Weiss announced in October that she was the new editor-in-chief of CBS News and her outlet, The Free Press, would join Paramount. Weiss, who famously quit The New York Times in 2020 after detailing bullying by her colleagues, went on to launch the \"Common Sense\" newsletter in 2021 before rebranding it as The Free Press and expanding it into a full-fledged media company in 2022. Weiss and The Free Press were long rumored to be coveted by Paramount's new owner David Ellison before she announced the news. \"We’re a news organization, so I’ll get right to it: This morning, The Free Press is joining Paramount,\" Weiss wrote in an email to readers. \"This move is a testament to many things: The Free Press team; the vision of Paramount’s new leaders; the luck of starting an independent media company at the right moment; and the courage of my colleagues to leave behind old worlds to build a new one,\" she continued. \"But, above all, it’s a testament to you, our subscribers.\" The purchase price for The Free Press was $150 million in cash and Paramount stock, according to reports. In December, Weiss caused headlines once again when she delayed a \"60 Minutes\" segment on CECOT, saying it was part of a broader mission to win back audience trust and suggesting the story wasn't yet \"comprehensive and fair.\" ‘THE VIEW’ HAD 128 LIBERAL GUESTS BUT ONLY TWO CONSERVATIVES IN 2025, STUDY FINDS Associated Press, Trump White House beef over Gulf of America Trump signed an executive order renaming the \"Gulf of Mexico\" to the \"Gulf of America\" on his first day in office for a second term. But The Associated Press parked an on-going feud by deciding to refer to the body of water by its original name while acknowledging the new moniker chosen by Trump. Trump blocked AP reporters from the Oval Office and Air Force One for failing to comply with the name change, resulting in a significant First Amendment battle. The AP is now fighting to have its access restored, and at stake is whether the president is allowed to dictate which reporters and news organizations are allowed to cover official events in places like the Oval Office based on viewpoint. Both sides returned to court in December for a critical hearing. \"If the president wants to invite particular people into the White House, because of their political views, I think the president is allowed to do that,\" Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General Yaakov Roth argued on behalf of the administration. \"The president routinely invites Republicans, and not Democrats, into the Oval Office for ceremonies,\" Roth continued. \"Nobody thinks he has to extend those invitations on a view-point neutral basis.\" Roth said that for the \"same reasons,\" the president should be allowed to \"invite favored reporters, and not disfavored reporters,\" to watch a ceremony in the Oval Office. Roth argued that the Oval Office and Air Force One are \"invitation only,\" as opposed to the White House briefing room, which is a dedicated workplace for journalists. \"When it is a matter of invitation, we don’t apply viewpoint neutrality principles,\" Roth said. The AP’s attorney, Charles Tobin, said the First Amendment \"does not stop at the Oval Office door\" when pushing for access to be restored. Associated Press Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Julie Pace told Fox News Digital ahead of the hearing that the decision to stick with the Gulf of Mexico is largely because the AP caters to a global audience, and consumers outside the United States don’t necessarily abide by Trump’s name change. She said coverage indicates the president has signed an executive order renaming that body of water. An order is expected in the coming weeks. Matthew Dowd fired by MSNBC after bizarre Charlie Kirk commentary An unusual media saga unfolded when MSNBC fired political analyst Matthew Dowd in September for suggesting \"hateful\" rhetoric from Turning Point USA co-founder Charlie Kirk led to his own assassination. Kirk, a leading conservative activist and top ally of President Trump, died at the age of 31 after he was shot while holding an event on the campus of Utah Valley University in Orem, Utah. In a stunning moment, Dowd suggested that Kirk’s assassination was caused by a chain reaction from his \"hateful words\" against various groups. Dowd said Kirk has been \"one of the most divisive, especially divisive younger figures in this, who is constantly sort of pushing this sort of hate speech or sort of aimed at certain groups. And I always go back to, hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions.\" \"I think that’s the environment we’re in, that the people just — you can’t stop with these sort of awful thoughts you have, and then saying these awful words, and not expect awful actions to take place. And that's the unfortunate environment we're in,\" he added. Before the news that Kirk had died, Dowd also told host Katy Tur, \"We don’t know any of the full details of this yet. We don’t know if this was a supporter shooting their gun off in celebration.\" MSNBC, which has since been rebranded as MS NOW, publicly condemned Dowd's comments before he was officially terminated. \"During our breaking news coverage of the shooting of Charlie Kirk, Matthew Dowd made comments that were inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable,\" MS NOW President Rebecca Kutler said in a statement. \"We apologize for his statements, as has he. There is no place for violence in America, political or otherwise.\" Dowd, who joined MSNBC in 2022 after a long stint at ABC News, tried to backtrack on the liberal social media platform Bluesky. \"On an earlier appearance on MSNBC I was asked a question on the environment we are in. I apologize for my tone and words. Let me be clear, I in no way intended for my comments to blame Kirk for this horrendous attack. Let us all come together and condemn violence of any kind,\" Dowd wrote. Right-wing infighting plagues AmericaFest The annual Turning Point USA conference in Phoenix revealed a significant rift within the MAGA movement in 2025, with conservative personalities like Ben Shapiro and Tucker Carlson engaging in a war of words during their time on the AmericaFest stage. This emerging fracture within the conservative movement was touched upon by Erika Kirk at the outset of the event. She recalled her husband being a \"peacemaker\" and a \"coalition builder\" and that, after his assassination in September, \"we saw infighting. We've seen fractures. We've seen bridges being burned that shouldn't be burnt. We saw a lot on full display.\" Shapiro opened his remarks by denouncing figures like Carlson and Candace Owens, accusing them of undermining conservative principles. \"Today the conservative movement is in serious danger, not just from the left that all too frequently excuses everything up to and including murder,\" Shapiro said. \"The conservative movement is also in danger from charlatans who claim to speak in the name of principle but actually traffic in conspiracism and dishonesty, who offer nothing but bile and despair, who seek to undermine fundamental principles of conservatism by championing aggravation and grievance. These people are frauds, and they are grifters, and they do not deserve your time.\" While acknowledging that Carlson was also scheduled to speak at the conference later that night, The Daily Wire co-founder said commentators such as Carlson were \"guilty of cowardice\" for staying silent as Owens spread conspiracy theories regarding Kirk’s assassination. \"The fact that they have said nothing while Candace has been vomiting all sorts of hideous and conspiratorial nonsense to the public square for years is just as cowardly,\" Shapiro said. He also criticized Carlson's methods as \"lazy, stupid and misleading\" for implying insider knowledge but refusing to show evidence under the guise of asking questions. Approximately an hour after Shapiro delivered his speech, Carlson took the stage and seemed to mock Shapiro's attempt to \"deplatform and denounce\" people who disagree with him. \"I just got here, and I feel like I missed the first part of the program. Hope I didn't miss anything meaningful. But I just want to say I don't think I did,\" Carlson quipped. \"No, I'm just kidding. I watched it. I laughed.\" He added that he \"laughed that kind of bitter sardonic laugh that emerges from you and, like, upside-down world arrives. When your dog starts doing your taxes, and you're like, 'Wait, it's not supposed to work this way.'\" While he didn't mention Shapiro by name, Carlson seemed to take multiple jabs at Shapiro's speech, saying it was \"hilarious\" to hear \"calls for, like, deplatforming and denouncing people at a Charlie Kirk event.\" The following day, conservative commentator Megyn Kelly took the stage for a conversation with TPUSA contributor Jack Posobiec, and she tore into Shapiro for acting as a gatekeeper of the conservative movement. \"[Shapiro] thinks he's in a position to decide who must say what to whom and when,\" Kelly said. \"So, I don't think we are friends anymore. I've been a very good friend to Ben.\" The infighting has continued in the wake of AmericaFest. Trump files $10 billion lawsuit against BBC over documentary editing his Jan 6 remarks President Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit in December against the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) for its 2024 \"Panorama\" documentary that distorted his Jan. 6 remarks. Trump sued the BBC for both defamation and for a violation of Florida’s Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act for $5 billion apiece, as the president is seeking $10 billion total. The suit, filed in the Southern District of Florida Federal Court, was filed in a personal capacity and names BBC and BBC studios productions as defendants. The BBC has come under intense scrutiny over the documentary about Trump’s Jan. 6, 2021, speech delivered before the riot at the U.S. Capitol. Critics claim the documentary was wildly misleading because it omitted Trump's call for supporters to protest peacefully. The lawsuit states: \"The BBC, faced with overwhelming and justifiable outrage on both sides of the Atlantic, has publicly admitted its staggering breach of journalistic ethics, and apologized, but has made no showing of actual remorse for its wrongdoing nor meaningful institutional changes to prevent future journalistic abuses.\" A BBC spokesperson told Fox News Digital: \"As we have made clear previously, we will be defending this case. We are not going to make further comment on ongoing legal proceedings.\" The BBC previously issued an apology for the erroneous edit and said it had pulled the program from its platforms, but a spokesperson for the broadcaster added, \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The controversy began with a bombshell report from The Telegraph that featured excerpts from a whistleblower dossier compiled by Michael Prescott, a communications advisor hired by the BBC to review its editorial standards. The whistleblower revealed that a BBC Panorama documentary released last year had a misleading edit of comments Trump made during a rally speech given on Jan. 6, 2021, as he protested the results of the 2020 presidential election. The documentary omitted Trump urging his supporters to protest \"peacefully\" and instead spliced two separate comments made nearly an hour apart, making him appear he was calling for violence. \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And I'll be there with you. And we fight — we fight like hell,\" the documentary showed Trump saying. In reality, Trump said, \"We're gonna walk down to the Capitol. And we're gonna cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women, and we're probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you'll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength and you have to be strong.\" It wasn't until 54 minutes later that Trump called on his supporters to \"fight like hell\" for election integrity. The New York Times referred to the ordeal as \"one of the worst crises in its 103-year history\" of the BBC. The blunder led to the resignations of BBC News CEO Deborah Turness and BBC director-general Tim Davie.

Fool me twice, shame on me.”\n\nThis comes to mind reading reports of the mind-boggling welfare fraud megascandal that has been exposed in Minnesota.\n\nFor perspective on the scope of the scandal, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joe Thompson estimates fraud losses in Minnesota since 2018 could top $9 billion.\n\nWe’re talking about fraud in Medicaid, nutrition programs, government-funded housing programs, government programs to assist autistic children, etc.\n\nBeyond tracking down and indicting criminals, there are critically important lessons to be learned here for our country, and we must learn them.\n\nWhat do we learn about the connection between fraud and big government? What do we learn about fraud, big government and the Democratic Party? What lessons do we learn regarding our immigration policy?\n\nFraud and big government go hand in hand.\n\nA Government Accountability Office report in July notes over $300 billion of fraudulent payments in 19 pandemic-relief programs.\n\nLast May, CBS’ “60 Minutes” reported on vast fraud in federal spending programs. Per estimates of a woman who spent “a decade” at GAO, “I believe the government is losing between $550 billion and about $750 billion a year” in fraud.\n\nWhat’s the connection to the Democratic Party? Simple. Democrats are the party of big government. Every proposal coming out of the Democratic Party involves more government. More government programs, which means more fraud.\n\nAnd, of course, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, at the helm of his state while all this was happening, was the Democratic nominee in 2024 to be our vice president. He was introduced by Kamala Harris as her running mate, saying he’s “the kind of vice president that America needs.”\n\nThe Cato Institute issues a biannual Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors, grading all 50 governors on tax and spending policies. In the last report in 2024, number 50 out of 50 governors was Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, scoring 19 points out of a possible 100.\n\nWhat is the lesson regarding immigration?\n\nThe Somali community in Minnesota disproportionately participated in this widespread fraud.\n\nInterviewing Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, CBS’ “Face the Nation” moderator Margaret Brennan noted that in COVID-19 fraud exceeding a billion dollars, “of 87 charged all but eight are of Somali descent.”\n\nOmar herself is Somali and a member of the far-left “squad” in Congress.\n\nNoting the disproportionate Somali presence in the scandal, President Donald Trump wrote on social media, “Send them back to where they came from. It’s OVER.”\n\nThose calling Trump a racist miss the point.\n\nConsider the Corruption Perception Index published annually by Transparency International, an organization working to eliminate corruption around the globe.\n\nOut of 180 countries measured in the Transparency International Index, Somalia is the second most corrupt country in the world.\n\nWorth noting is the strong inverse relation of corruption with economic freedom. The most economically free countries — smaller government, less intrusive regulation, strong consistent rule of law — are also the least corrupt.\n\nIn the annual Fraser Institute Economic Freedom of the World Report, out of 165 countries measured and ranked in economic freedom, Somalia ranks 101.\n\nThe point is that the Somalians so prominent in the massive fraud in Minnesota come from a country with values and reality the total antithesis of what our country is about. It is a country with little economic freedom and widespread corruption. If Somalis chose to come here to be free and responsible citizens, good for them and good for us. But it appears many have brought the destructive values of their home country with them. They should be screened.\n\nRep. Omar has been a perverse megaphone for anti-American sentiment since she arrived in Congress.\n\nSo, cut fraud by cutting back the scope of government, and shut our borders to those who do not aspire to our values of personal responsibility and freedom.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/123888-lessons-to-learn-from-the-welfare-mega-fraud-scandal-in-minnesota-2025-12-31","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01KBZTXKS1F09MEAR3DK5XAJPT.jpeg?w=1200&h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 13:45:56","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.394},{"id":390339844,"title":"'Keep in mind': Conservative hit with context over fraud claims in viral videos","text":"A CNN panel ripped apart viral video claims by a right-wing YouTuber claiming rampant fraud at Somali-run child care centers in Minnesota.\n\nYouTube content creator Nick Shirley recorded video of himself and a conservative activist barging into daycares looking for evidence they took federal funds without actually providing child care, but media analyst Sara Fischer told \"CNN This Morning\" that his claims are politically motivated and possibly suspect.\n\n\"Well, I think a lot of people were very apt to believe Shirley's videos because we had indictments in 2022, when reporting first came out about this issue,\" Fischer said. \"It was David Fahrenthold, then at the Washington Post, who started to unravel all of these claims.

This is not about the Somalians. I think the reason that it's being focused on Somalians is because they're the ones committing it. We took these people in as refugees, and it looks like there's billions and billions of dollars of scams. So hopefully we can get some convictions here and get some justice because people need this money. People need help with daycare and no one should be scammed of it, especially taxpayers.\"\n\nDemocratic strategist Antjuan Seawright stepped in with a bit of context.\n\n\"Well, if I can just quickly add, keep in mind Trump University also was was convicted for fraud,\" Seawright said, \"and I would also add that this president has pardoned those close to him who's had has had their own allegations of fraud.

They did everything they could to smear and destroy Donald Trump, yet the American people rejected the Left’s extremism and returned Trump to the White House.\n\nFrom open borders to horrible economic policies that created skyrocketing inflation, there were many reasons why Kamala Harris failed to connect with voters. Another big reason was best summed up by the brilliant Trump ad that ended, “Kamala’s for they/them. President Trump is for you.”\n\nReasonable people believed, or at least hoped, that Democrats would finally understand that they shouldn’t be falling on their sword for all things LGBTQ. And especially not the insane transgender agenda that the public has turned decidedly against.\n\nWell, Democrats haven’t learned anything at all.\n\nAs an example, the Democrats’ favorite newspaper, the Washington Post, just ran a profile story that started on the front page, filled two more inside pages, and half of another page. Were they covering an American war hero? No. A civil rights icon? No.\n\nThe subject was a boy in Washington State who has “stolen” girls’ track awards because he claims he is a girl. The whole puff piece is about a “noble” boy stealing honors from girls. And this is coming from a “newspaper” that prides itself on being progressive!\n\nThe Post story would have been more fitting if it ran as the lead obituary—of the feminist movement! When boys are applauded for invading girls’ bathrooms and cheered for denying them athletic accomplishments and scholarships, the feminist movement is officially D-E-A-D.\n\nNext month, the Supreme Court will hear cases challenging laws from Idaho and West Virginia that prohibit boys from playing in girls’ sports. Of course, we’re hoping and praying for a positive outcome.\n\nBut 130 congressional Democrats put their names on a legal brief begging the justices to strike down these commonsense laws that respect the privacy and safety of young girls, as well as biological science.\n\nOnce again, we see how the intolerant Left has no interest in allowing states to reflect their own values. They want to force every state to accept the values of San Francisco.\n\nGraham’s Prayer\n\nI want to tip my hat to Reverend Franklin Graham, son of legendary evangelist Billy Graham and president of Samaritan’s Purse. Graham is slow to anger. But he was really angry Monday after learning that more than 100 Democrats are asking the Supreme Court to allow boys into girls’ locker rooms and bathrooms. Graham wrote on social media:\n\n“If you believe men should be allowed in women’s bathrooms and to undress in your daughter’s or granddaughter’s locker room, then you should vote Democrat. \nOver one hundred and thirty Democrats in the House and Senate [are] urging the Supreme Court to support biological males in women’s sports. This is sick. If it turns your stomach, beware…”\n\n“I’m not a Republican or a Democrat—no party has my loyalty. I’m going to vote for the platform that best supports American and Biblical values. Men in women’s sports and restrooms is perverted. \n\n\"Pray that God will guide the hearts of the Supreme Court justices to do the right thing as they deliberate this issue in just a couple of weeks.”\n\nAmen to that, Reverend Graham! We join you in that prayer!\n\nLeft-wing Lunacy\n\nHere’s another example of the sickness in the Democrat Party.\n\nA few days ago, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass was asked to comment on a report that found a majority of Border Patrol agents are Hispanic. The frequently catatonic Bass actually showed some real emotion in her response.\n\nShe gave long-winded answers, so I’ll paraphrase her remarks. Bass said she thought it was horrible that Hispanic Americans would want to help protect our borders and keep illegal aliens out of the country.\n\nThat’s about as racist as you can get! Apparently, Bass thinks that if you’re Hispanic, you must be “for” illegal Hispanics entering your country.\n\nImagine someone asking her why Blacks would want to work for the Los Angeles Police Department. Does she think it’s horrible for Black Americans to want to keep their streets and communities safe? Or does she think that if you’re Black, you must be “for” Black criminals?\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin eagerly set Mayor Bass straight, saying:\n\n“The patriotic men and women joined Border Patrol because they want to defend our homeland, help secure our borders, and catch drug traffickers, gang members, pedophiles, rapists, and murderers trying to illegally enter our country. \n\n\"Mayor Bass should stop race-baiting for media clicks and start thanking our law enforcement officers for making California communities safe again—something she refuses to do.”","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/123885-they-learned-nothing-2025-12-31","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 13:18:29","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.168},{"id":390360038,"title":"How national politics reshaped local policing in 2025","text":"Any honest retrospective of 2025 must acknowledge how deeply national politics shaped the daily work of local law enforcement. Throughout the year, political violence, immigration enforcement, domestic extremism and the rapid expansion of surveillance technology repeatedly placed police officers at the center of conflicts driven as much by ideology as by traditional crime.\n\nRegardless of political affiliation or personal belief, agencies were forced to adapt to an environment where national policy decisions and political rhetoric produced immediate operational consequences. Protection details, protest response, threat investigations and shifting criminal justice priorities became routine responsibilities, with impacts felt most acutely at the patrol level.\n\nThe big issues of the year — political violence, immigration enforcement, domestic terrorism and surveillance technology, including drones — were repeatedly shaped by actions taken at the national level beginning on the first days of the new administration.\n\nPolitical violence and domestic terrorism\n\n2025 began in the shadow of 2024, a year marked by intense political division and violence. During the campaign season, former President Donald Trump survived two unsuccessful assassination attempts, underscoring the heightened tensions surrounding the election. The race itself shifted dramatically after President Biden withdrew and Vice President Kamala Harris entered as the Democratic nominee.\n\nOn December 24, 2024, UnitedHealth CEO Brian Thompson was gunned down on the streets of New York City, a crime that further amplified national concern over politically charged violence.\n\nViolence believed to be rooted in divisive political rhetoric continued into the first hours of 2025. In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar planted an explosive device in an ice chest on Bourbon Street, followed by a second device 30 minutes later. Before the hour ended, Jabbar used a rented Ford F-150 to breach barriers and drive into a crowded area, killing 14 people and injuring nearly 50 others before engaging police in a shootout that ended with his death.\n\n| READ NOW: Modern terrorism tactics: The threat of vehicle-based attacks\n\nIn April, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro awoke to flames following a firebombing of his residence by Cody Allen Balmer, 38, who was later convicted of attempted murder and terrorism-related charges. Although Balmer claimed no religious motive, Shapiro is Jewish, and the attack occurred during Passover.\n\nIn June, the homes of two Democratic state legislators were attacked. Vance Boelter, 57, was indicted on two counts of murder for killing Minnesota State Representative Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark Hortman. Boelter allegedly also attacked State Senator John Hoffman and his wife and daughter, Yvette and Hope Hoffman.\n\n| READ NOW: How local law enforcement can prevent political violence against public officials\n\nOne of the most shocking assassinations of the year was the brutal murder of Charlie Kirk, an outspoken conservative, on the campus of Utah Valley University on September 10. The motive of the alleged killer, 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, remains unclear. While Robinson came from a family with conservative values, investigators noted comments he made to his romantic partner, who is transitioning from male to female, expressing intolerance of what he perceived as Kirk’s “hate.”\n\n| READ NOW: Protecting high-profile figures: A police plan for preventing targeted attacks\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and Border Patrol facilities were also targeted. On July 4, an assault in Alvarado, Texas, attributed to reported anarchists, resulted in a police officer being shot and wounded. Federal prosecutors later indicted nine individuals on charges including attempted murder and arson. Three days later in McAllen, Texas, an attacker was killed after opening fire on a Border Patrol facility, injuring three officers. In September, a sniper attack in Dallas killed two detainees after shots were fired into an ICE field office.\n\nProtest activity across the country disrupted ICE operations. The Department of Justice reported threats against ICE agents increased by more than 8,000 percent, while assaults rose by over 1,000 percent.\n\nLocal officials were not spared. A Princeton University report documented more than 300 threats against local officials nationwide. The U.S. Marshals Service investigated over 600 threats against judges, while the U.S. Capitol Police recorded approximately 14,000 threats against members of Congress.\n\nIn June, Mohamed Sabry Soliman, 45, later determined to be in the United States illegally, threw firebombs at a group of mostly elderly protesters in Boulder, Colorado, who were raising awareness about hostages held in Gaza. Fifteen people were injured, and one later died from the attack. Additional antisemitic violence included the murder of two young Israeli workers attending a diplomatic reception in Washington, D.C., in May. Elias Rodriguez, 31, of Chicago, was arrested at the scene and reportedly chanted “Free Palestine” while in custody.\n\nIn March, the Republican Party headquarters and a Tesla showroom in Albuquerque, New Mexico, were firebombed. Jamison Wagner, 40, was federally charged in both incidents. Nationwide, at least 20 Tesla dealerships were attacked, and surveys indicated that nearly half of Tesla owners experienced vandalism, apparently linked to outrage over Elon Musk’s association with the administration. The FBI subsequently issued a nationwide domestic terrorism alert.\n\nTwo significant threats against U.S. officials in October resulted in arrests. Christopher Moynihan, 34, a pardoned January 6 defendant, was arrested in Clinton, New York, for making a terroristic threat against House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. In Minnesota, Tyler Maxon Avalos was arrested after allegedly posting a TikTok video offering a $45,000 bounty for the killing of U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi.\n\nAttacks on religious groups with suspected political overtones also occurred, including incidents at Antioch High School in Nashville in January, Annunciation School in Minnesota in August, and a Michigan LDS church. These attacks resulted in seven deaths and dozens of injuries.\n\nCriminal justice issues on the national stage\n\nBeginning with the mass pardon of defendants charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, Capitol assault and an aggressive response to immigration and border issues, the administration moved quickly to reverse criminal justice policies of the prior administration.\n\nA flurry of executive orders began on “day one,” including Executive Order 14147, which stated it was U.S. policy to “identify and take appropriate action to correct past misconduct by the Federal Government related to the weaponization of law enforcement and the Intelligence Community.”\n\nExecutive Order 14157 designated certain cartels and organizations as Foreign Terrorist Organizations and Specially Designated Global Terrorists, laying groundwork for expanded domestic and international enforcement actions. Executive Orders 14159 and 14161 reframed illegal immigration as an imminent national security threat, expanding the role of the military in enforcement and restoring advocacy for the death penalty.\n\n| READ NOW: When cartels act like terrorists: How narco-terrorism is reshaping police readiness\n\nAnother sweeping executive order reversed multiple prior directives, including the 2023 establishment of the National Law Enforcement Accountability Database created in response to the George Floyd in-custody death. The database was deactivated.\n\nThe Department of Justice dismissed federal prosecutors and FBI agents associated with prior investigations, including those related to January 6 and the classified documents search at Trump’s Florida residence.\n\nHigh-profile appointments followed, including Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI Director Kash Patel, Deputy Director Dan Bongino, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Border Czar Tom Homan.\n\nExecutive Order 14288, titled Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law Enforcement to Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens, received comparatively little public attention despite significant implications. The order emphasized support for aggressive law enforcement, expanded training and pay, increased federal cooperation and access to military assets.\n\nThe administration also announced a FEMA review council, prompting concern that disaster response funding for overwhelmed local jurisdictions could be reduced.\n\nICE enforcement encountered violent and organized opposition in several states. In California, unrest led to the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops to protect federal buildings and personnel, followed by an additional 700 Marines assigned to support the Guard.\n\nIn New York, Zohran Mamdani won the mayoral election after campaigning on major criminal justice reforms, prompting reports of significant NYPD departures.\n\nExecutive Order 14307 declared the importance of drone technology, citing its expanding role in public safety and emergency response.\n\nThe administration’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” was signed into law, increasing funding for ICE and border security, fully funding the 287(g) program that allows local law enforcement to enforce federal immigration law. The bill also eliminated federal income tax on overtime pay, providing potential financial relief for many officers.\n\nExecutive Order 14321, Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets, sought to expand civil commitment for certain populations, redirect grant funding toward enforcement of drug use, camping and squatting prohibitions, and roll back consent decrees deemed restrictive.\n\nA national “crime emergency” was declared, resulting in the deployment of 800 National Guard troops to Washington, D.C., and federal control of the Metropolitan Police Department. Similar deployments followed in Chicago, Portland and Memphis. Additional troops were sent to D.C. after the murder of West Virginia Army National Guard Specialist Sarah Beckstrom and the wounding of U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe.\n\n| READ NOW: Federal surge in D.C.: How it works and the history behind it\n\nExecutive Order 14342 took steps to end cashless bail.\n\nThe U.S. military initiated strikes against suspected drug trafficking vessels. The administration also announced a renewed focus on left-wing domestic terrorism following the Charlie Kirk assassination.\n\nCalifornia enacted a law banning officers from wearing face coverings that obscure identity while on duty, a move critics said was aimed at ICE enforcement practices.\n\nFentanyl was declared a weapon of mass destruction. An ideologically motivated attack occurred on the campus of Brown University.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAn old political saying holds that all politics is local. For law enforcement, the lesson of 2025 may be sharper: all politics eventually finds its way into the patrol car.\n\nLocal law enforcement has borne the brunt of growing anti-police sentiment, shifting policy priorities and increased operational demands. Whether driven by crime trends or public perception, communities ultimately demand safety, and police are tasked with delivering it amid constant political change.\n\nWith or without an administration emphasizing aggressive enforcement, the realities of crime, fear and public pressure remain. The challenge for law enforcement leaders is preparing officers to navigate those realities professionally, lawfully and safely — regardless of who occupies the White House.\n\n|WATCH NOW: Trump and Police in 2025","summary":"How national politics reshaped local policing in 2025","url":"https://www.police1.com/year-in-review/how-national-politics-rode-along-in-the-patrol-car-in-2025","image":"https://lexipol.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d101834/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3248x2161+0+0/resize/1486x989!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fk1-prod-lexipol.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fae%2Fb3%2F9a5f05e740ca99c0a114f5eed42c%2Fap252477190","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 12:41:11","author":"Chief Joel F.

Posting on X and Facebook, multiple social media users have shared posters and images depicting plans for the day of action in which they will state their intention to withhold taxes. It is not clear who is organizing the protests but they appear to be aligned with the right, as some social media posts about the protests attack Democrats and say that right-wing politician people associated with the Make America Great Again (MAGA) movement will speak at the events. Newsweek reached out to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by email to comment on this story outside of normal business hours. Pedestrians walk past graffiti advocating rent and tax strikes, Wednesday, April 1, 2020, in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Why It Matters The planned strikes show the extent to which politics is becoming polarized in the U.S. and tensions are escalating. Previous protests have been organized by anti-Trump groups on the left so the emergence of anti-Democrat protests is significant. Meanwhile, if enough people refuse to pay their taxes, this will have a significant impact on the running of key services in different states and could persuade politicians to negotiate with protesters to keep taxpayer-funder operations viable. What To Know According to posters, one event will take place at the Oregon State Capitol at 12 p.m. local time. Oregon is a blue state that voted for former vice president Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. A poster about the event said: “We want out money back. Taxpayers demand accountability.“ It added: “Oregonians are standing up against fraud, waste, and abuse of taxpayer dollars. This is a peaceful call to action demanding transparency, responsibility, and answers.“ Another post said Scott Keyser, the mayor of Molalla, Oregon, and Joseph Lehman, a libertarian candidate for U.S. Congress, will be speaking at the Oregon rally. Newsweek contacted Keyser and Lehman by email to comment on this story outside of normal business hours. Another poster circulating on social media calls for a “tax strike rally at all state Capitols.“ It said it was “inspired by Nick Shirley's expose of government fraud & corruption!“ On Friday, Shirley released a 42-minute video, that has now been viewed more than 130 million times, alleging fraud in nearly a dozen taxpayer-funded daycare centers in Minnesota. It comes amid widespread accusations of fraud in the state. There have also been protests from anti-Trump groups in recent months. Group Refuse Fascism gathered in D.C. to protest Trump's federal takeover of local policing, marching 1.5 miles to the White House behind banners reading “No fascist takeover of D.C.“ and “No military occupation.“ “Vets Say No“ protests, organized by About Face, a movement of post 9/11 veterans, and May Day Strong, a self-described anti-authoritarian movement, took place on Tuesday, November 11, across the country to protest ICE and “fascism.“ Meanwhile, the issue of tax strikes has attracted national attention. Georgia Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene shared posts from people saying they were opting out of taxes and wrote on X on Monday: “Nationwide tax strike incoming.“ What People Are Saying Writing on X, a Trump supporting account called Tommy4Trump420 who has 36,000 followers and is speaking at an event in Oregon said: “Please if you live in Oregon you must show up and show out for our country!

The dollar is down 9.5 percent against a basket of 10 major global currencies on the year as the country has been thrown into economic uncertainty by President Donald Trump’s trade war—its steepest decline since 2017. Newsweek contacted the White House for comment by email on Wednesday morning, outside of standard working hours. Why It Matters For many voters, the defining issue that brought them to elect Trump in the 2024 elections over then-Vice President Kamala Harris was the economy—and to be more precise, the cost of living. Trump promised to bring down inflation and lower grocery prices—among others, such as housing—“on Day One“ of his second mandate, but has so far failed to keep his promise. Official data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) shows that grocery prices rose by 2.7 percent in the 12 months to September, with some seeing particularly high increases (coffee, for example, was up 18.9 percent). Other costs—such as that of electricity—have also risen, and homeownership remains out of reach for many in the country. U.S. President Donald Trump speaks during a news conference with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky following their meeting at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago Club on December 28, 2025, in Palm Beach, Florida. Recent polls show that frustration is growing among U.S. voters—including those who supported Trump last year—over the economy, which is in turn translating into the president’s apparently dwindling popularity. What To Know The dollar’s weakness this year has been largely driven by panic over the Trump administration’s aggressive tariff policies, which targeted some of the country’s biggest partners. While the dollar has been faltering, other currencies have been faring much better. By comparison, the euro reported the biggest rise of any major currencies against the dollar, climbing nearly 14 percent to above $1.17, a level it had not reached since 2021. The Russian ruble has been doing even better, despite the fact that the country continues to be hit by sanctions linked to its invasion of Ukraine. The currency has emerged as the strongest-performing this year, surging 45 percent over the 12 months against major currencies. What People Are Saying Peter Schiff, chief economist at Europac.com, wrote on X last week: “King dollar’s reign is coming to an end. Gold will take the throne as the primary central bank reserve asset. That means the U.S. dollar will crash against other fiat currencies, and America’s free ride on the global gravy train will end. Prepare for a historic economic collapse.“ George Saravelos, global head of FX research at Deutsche Bank, told the Financial Times: “This has been one of the worst years for dollar performance in the history of free-floating exchange rates.“ The weakness of the dollar, he said, can be traced back in part to a “structural reassessment of unhedged dollar exposures by global investors, particularly in Europe.“ Joseph Trevisani, senior analyst at FX Street in New York, told CNBC: “We don’t have any direction in Fed policy and so you’re seeing that reflected in the dollar and the currency rates, you’re seeing it reflected in the interest rates as well in the Treasury rates, so the market doesn’t have a lot to work with right here.“ He added: “If we’re looking for movement in the new year in the dollar and the currencies and maybe even interest rates, we’re going to have to start looking at the economy and see if that will move things.“ Trump wrote on Truth Social last week: “The TARIFFS are responsible for the GREAT USA Economic Numbers JUST ANNOUNCED…AND THEY WILL ONLY GET BETTER!.“ What Happens Next The dollar is still the world’s dominant currency, but many have warned that it might weaken to a point where its position in the global order is questioned and redefined. The jury is also still out on the impact of Trump’s tariffs on the U.S. economy. Many feared that the tariffs would crash the nation’s economy, but these concerns have so far not materialized. But an important role in the dollar’s performance next year will also be played by the Federal Reserve, which is expected to see Jerome Powell being replaced by a new chair which could possibly get along with the president a little better than his predecessor, who has been attacked by Trump repeatedly this year over rate cuts and policy decisions. If the new chair continues cutting rates in 2026, as Trump wishes for, even as other central banks hold steady or raise them, analysts and investors think that the dollar will continue plunging, the FT reported.","summary":"The greenback reported its biggest annual drop since 2017, in yet another blow to President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/us-dollar-falters-blow-donald-trump-11287854","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2253856688.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 11:00:45","author":"Giulia Carbonaro","authors":["Giulia Carbonaro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.46},{"id":390334194,"title":"MS NOW’s top on-air moments of 2025","text":"From a new president in the White House to natural disasters wreaking havoc across the country to the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, MS NOW covered all of year’s biggest stories, bringing viewers the latest breaking news, interviews with newsmakers, and sharp analysis from the network's hosts and experts.\n\nWith 2026 sure to bring even more headlines, here are some of MS NOW's top on-air moments of 2025:\n\nFrom Jan. 7 to the end of the month, wildfires swept across Southern California, displacing tens of thousands, killing at least 30 people, and destroying more than 16,000 homes and businesses. Katy Tur, an Los Angeles native, reported live from outside her childhood home, which had burned to the ground. Tur shared with viewers the emotions felt by many who were affected by the fires.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNxFHnqNK6I\n\nOn Jan. 20, Donald Trump took the oath of office and was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. During his inauguration speech, held indoors in the Capitol Rotunda due to weather, Trump declared that \"the golden age of America begins right now\" and told Americans he would be a \"peacemaker and unifier.\"\n\nFollowing that speech, MSNOW's primetime anchors shared their reactions to the president's vision for his second term.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tfuxRoLpTDw\n\nOn Jan. 29, a passenger jet and an Army Black Hawk helicopter collided midair over the Potomac River near Washington, D.C.'s Reagan International Airport, killing 67 people and leaving no survivors. The collision was the deadliest plane crash on American soil in more than two decades. Many of the victims aboard the American Airlines flight were young figure skaters returning home from a camp in Wichita, Kansas.\n\n\"This was a dark and excruciating night in our nation's capital and in our nation's history,\" Trump said in remarks the following day.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlVIlcM0sW4\n\nOn Feb. 11, Trump and billionaire Elon Musk held a joint appearance inside the Oval Office to discuss the newly established Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The world's richest man, then a special government employee, defended the agency, which he said would cut $2 trillion in waste, fraud and abuse. As Trump's first year in office comes to a close and the agency has been effectively shuttered, its estimated savings stand at just $214 billion, by its own accounting; a more recent analysis by The New York Times suggested it may have cost the government more money.\n\n\"Deadline: White House\" host Nicolle Wallace shared her reaction to Musk's bizarre Oval Office display upon its launch.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNTcbbSrHw0\n\nAnother Oval Office meeting made headlines in February, this one between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. The Feb. 28 meeting, intended to mark the start of negotiations on a deal for Ukraine’s rare earth minerals, quickly devolved into a shouting match. Trump and Vice President JD Vance attacked the Ukrainian president and chastised him for not thanking the U.S. for its assistance in its war against Russia.\n\nMS NOW's primetime hosts gave their analysis of the acrimonious meeting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JJc-UbDo-M\n\nOn March 4, Trump delivered an address to a joint session of Congress, reflecting on his first six weeks in office and outlining his agenda for a second term. The historically long speech was full of personal attacks and false statements. Shortly after Trump concluded, Rachel Maddow set the record straight on the president's remarks.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GanWPYhUq04\n\nOn March 24, The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg dropped one of the biggest political stories of the year, revealing he had been inadvertently added to a group chat on Signal in which administration officials discussed military strikes in Yemen. Officials, including Vance and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, participated in the chat.\n\nGoldberg joined \"Morning Joe\" shortly after the story broke to discuss his reporting.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6p5fQsOp7U\n\nApril kicked off with Democratic Sen. Cory Booker's historic marathon floor speech. The New Jersey senator railed against the Trump administration in a speech that began at 7 p.m. on Monday, March 31, and and ended Tuesday night, April 1. Booker spoke for a total of 25 hours and 5 minutes, breaking a previous record held by the late Sen. Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who filibustered for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the Civil Rights Act of 1957.\n\n\"The Last Word\" host Lawrence O'Donnell said Booker's marathon effort helped give Americans a voice against the Trump administration.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1Awb38U9os\n\nApril 2 marked \"Liberation Day,\" when Trump unveiled his sweeping \"reciprocal tariffs\" on goods from more than 180 countries and territories. The plan set a 10% baseline tax across the board, with China, Vietnam and the European Union among those facing even steeper penalties.\n\nAli Velshi explained how the president's tariffs would take a toll on American consumers.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxgPq67ow90\n\nHistory was made again on May 8, when Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost of the United States was elected as the pope of the Catholic Church, taking the name Leo XIV. Leo, a Chicago native, became the first American to lead the church.\n\nHis longtime friend, Father Robert Hagan, joined MS NOW's \"The Weekend: Primetime\" to speak about the significance of Leo's election.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpKg9lHCqGc\n\nOn May 18, former President Joe Biden revealed he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer. The Democrat's announcement came a year after concerns over his health led to his withdrawal from the 2024 election. Following Biden's announcement, Trump said he and first lady Melania Trump were \"saddened to hear about\" the former president's diagnosis and wished him a \"fast and successful recovery.\"\n\nDr. Vin Gupta, an MS NOW medical contributor, reacted to Biden's diagnosis shortly after it was announced.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gw71oaHLZec\n\nOn May 30, Musk's tumultuous tenure at the White House officially came to an end. The world's richest man received an Oval Office send-off from the president after months of ostensibly working to rein in government spending. In his final weeks in Washington, tensions rose between the tech billionaire and Trump over the president's budget bill.\n\nFollowing his departure, \"All In\" host Chris Hayes reflected on Musk's legacy.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCQS_x1b90o\n\nProtests broke out across Los Angeles on June 6 following a series of high-profile U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in the city. The demonstrations led to a standoff between the Democratic-run state and the White House, as Trump deployed Marines and National Guard troops to quell protesters, testing the limits of executive authority.\n\nReporter Jacob Soboroff delivered a live report from the ground.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFH4MWwugUI\n\nOn June 14, the true size of the anti-Trump resistance was put into focus when Americans across all 50 states took to the streets as part of \"No Kings Day.\" According to organizers, more than 5 million people participated in the national day of action against authoritarianism.\n\nMaddow explained how Trump's efforts to suppress the protests against him backfired.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5ZLsBd4NG4\n\nOn July 2, a federal jury in Manhattan delivered a mixed verdict in the criminal trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, acquitting the music mogul of the most serious charges of racketeering and sex-trafficking but finding him guilty on lesser charges. The trial attracted nationwide attention and raised questions about abuse in the music industry.\n\nMS NOW delivered the breaking news of Combs' conviction.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SD2-IO4eJ0\n\nIn the early hours of July 4, Central Texas was hit by catastrophic flash flooding after extremely heavy rainfall that caused the Guadalupe River to rise rapidly. The flooding was deadly and destructive, with at least 135 people killed, including children from a nearby camp.\n\nChristian Brown, who was in a cabin with his family when the floodwaters hit, shared his story of survival with MS NOW.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riJhLjdlaq4\n\nAlso on July 4, after weeks of intense negotiations on Capitol Hill, Trump signed the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” into law. The legislation extended and made permanent key tax cuts that disproportionately benefit the rich and increased funding for immigration enforcement and defense, while cutting spending for social safety-net programs like Medicaid and SNAP.\n\nVelshi explained how the bill was a major step back for America's health care system. \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ts9-mZtuY\n\nOn Aug. 11, the president declared an emergency in Washington, D.C., federalized the city’s police and ordered the deployment of National Guard troops and federal law enforcement to the city's streets. Although Trump claimed it was an effort to combat crime, Maddow pulled back the curtain on what she suspected was the president's true motivation.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_LPDhSQBKMQ\n\nOn Aug. 15, Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin met in Anchorage, Alaska, for high-stakes talks focused on negotiating an end to Russia’s war in Ukraine. The summit marked their first face-to-face meeting since Trump’s second term began.\n\nFormer Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta explained to MS NOW why the meeting, which ended without a ceasefire agreement, was a failure for Trump.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DM9C74rQSmU\n\nConservative activist and Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck and killed on Sept. 10 while speaking at an outdoor event at Utah Valley University. Kirk's killing sparked conversations about the normalization of political violence in America.\n\n\"Politics Nation\" host Rev. Al Sharpton spoke about the troubling rise of politically motivated acts of violence.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaSxA2BiARs\n\nABC suspended late-night host Jimmy Kimmel on Sept. 17, taking him off the air “indefinitely” after he quipped about the Republican reaction to the suspect in Kirk's killing. The suspension occurred after major ABC affiliate owners, Nexstar and Sinclair, chose to preempt the show on their stations following public comments from Trump's Federal Communications Commission chair. Kimmel's suspension prompted a national debate over free speech and government censorship.\n\n\"The Briefing\" host Jen Psaki explained how the suspension was part of Trump's effort to reshape American media.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3ItkKJxbl8\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris sat down with Maddow on Sept. 22 for her first news interview since leaving office — and since her loss in the 2024 presidential election to Trump. During that exclusive interview, Harris gave a look behind the scenes of her 2024 campaign, shared her thoughts on the administration, and responded to speculation she may throw her hat into the ring in 2028.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8OyMIen9d4\n\nOn Oct. 1, the U.S. entered what would become the longest government shutdown in the country's history. As a result, hundreds of thousands of federal employees were furloughed or required to work without pay. Essential services, like food assistance for American's most vulnerable, were disrupted. After weeks of negotiations, the standoff came to an end on Nov. 12.\n\nFurloughed Labor Department worker Imelda Avila-Thomas spoke to MS NOW about the effect the shutdown had on her and her family.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zGrihaPCopM\n\nConstruction crews began demolishing the East Wing of the White House to make way for Trump’s planned $400 million ballroom on Oct. 20. Work on the president’s pet project commenced despite lack of approvals from the federal agency that oversees such projects.\n\nPsaki, who worked in the White House, described the demolition of the historic building as a \"gut punch.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bO5k2eDPN_4\n\nDemocratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the New York City mayoral election on Nov. 4, defeating Democratic heavyweight and former governor Andrew Cuomo, who ran as an independent. The 34-year-old, who focused his campaign around issues of affordability, became the city's youngest mayor in more than a century. Shortly after his victory, Mamdani traveled to Washington, D.C., for a surprisingly cordial visit with the president.\n\nMamdani sat down with MS NOW to discuss his chat with Trump.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekmZe4IoB88\n\nDefying weeks of public pressure from the White House, the Republican-controlled House on Nov. 18 passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, which directed the Justice Department to release all files relating to its investigation into the late disgraced financier. The measure was quickly approved by the Senate and later signed by the president.\n\nHayes explained how Trump was forced to back down after Republicans \"staged an open revolt.\"\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FWS3WiGx0_E\n\nOn Nov. 28, the Trump administration's strikes on purported drug boats in the Caribbean came under new scrutiny after The Washington Post reported that Hegseth told military officials to kill survivors of a Sept. 2 attack on a vessel off the coast of Venezuela. Hegseth denied giving the order but said he supported the additional strikes on the boat. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have called on the administration to release more information about their campaign in the region.\n\nMaddow said Hegseth ought to consider resigning in the wake of the allegations.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hdw6QSKFUAU\n\nOn Dec. 14, actor and filmmaker Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Singer Reiner, were found stabbed to death in their home. Reacting to the news, Trump attacked Reiner on social media, saying the prominent Democratic activist died due to \"Trump Derangement Syndrome.\"\n\n\"Morning Joe\" co-host Joe Scarborough slammed the president for injecting politics into a tragic situation.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNbEM8Ab03Q\n\nOn Dec. 19, the Justice Department began releasing thousands of documents related to its case against Epstein, just before the deadline imposed by the Epstein Files Transparency Act. The release of the documents is intended to shed new light on powerful figures in the late sex offender's orbit. However, the administration faced immediate backlash for withholding documents and issuing others with what some critics consider excessive redactions.\n\nOne of Epstein's survivors, Marina Lacerda, told MS NOW she was \"infuriated\" by the limited release.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hx6aVcPfyTI","url":"https://www.ms.now/news/ms-now-top-on-air-moments-2025-news-analysis","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1766587201/251224_EOY-on-air-moments-bk/251224_EOY-on-air-moments-bk.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 11:00:00","author":"Erum Salam","authors":["Erum Salam"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":390356680,"title":"Barabak: Democrats are on a roll. So why not fight one another?","text":"Democrats are starting the new year on a high. A series of 2025 victories, in red and blue states alike, was marked by a striking improvement over the party’s 2024 showing. That over-performance, to use the political term of art, means candidates — including even some who lost — received a significantly higher percentage of the vote than presidential candidate Kamala Harris managed. That’s a strong signal ahead of the midterm election, suggesting Democratic partisans are energized, a key ingredient in any successful campaign, and the party is winning support among independents and perhaps even a few disaffected Republicans. If history is a guide and the uneven economy a portent, Democrats will very likely seize control of the House in November, picking up at least the three seats needed to erase the GOP’s bare majority. The Senate looks to be a longer — though not impossible — reach, given the Republican lean of the states being contested. In short, Democrats are in much better shape than all the black crepe and existential ideations suggested a year ago. Yes, the party suffered a soul-crushing defeat in the presidential race. But 2024 was never the disaster some made it out to be. Democrats gained two House seats and held their own in most contests apart from the fight for the Senate, where several Republican states reverted to form and ousted the chamber's few remaining Democratic holdouts. Still, Democrats being Democrats, all is not happiness and light in the party of Jefferson, Jackson, Clinton and Obama. Campaigning to become the party's chairman, Ken Martin last winter promised to conduct a thorough review of the 2024 election and to make its findings public, as a step toward redressing Democrats' mistakes and bolstering the party going forward. ”What we need to do right now is really start to get a handle around what happened,” he told reporters before his election. Now Martin has decided to bury that autopsy report. \"Here’s our North Star: Does this help us win?” he said in a mid-December statement announcing his turnabout and the study's unceremonious interment. “If the answer is no, it’s a distraction from the core mission.” There is certainly no shortage of 2024 election analyses for the asking. The sifting of rubble, pointing of fingers and laying of blame began an eye blink after Donald Trump was declared the winner. There are prescriptions from the moderate and progressive wings of the party — suggesting, naturally, that Democrats absolutely must move their direction to stand any chance of ever winning again. There are diagnoses from a welter of 2028 presidential hopefuls, declared and undeclared, offering themselves as both seer and Democratic savior. The report Martin commissioned was, however, supposed to be the definitive word from the party, offering both a clear-eyed look back and a clarion way forward. “We know that we lost ground with Latino voters,\" he said in those searching days before he became party chairman. \"We know we lost ground with women and younger voters and, of course, working-class voters. We don't know the how and why yet.\" As part of the investigation, more than 300 Democrats were interviewed in each of the 50 states. But there was good reason to doubt the integrity of the report, even before Martin pulled out his shovel and started digging. According to the New York Times and others, there was no plan to examine President Biden's headstrong decision to seek reelection despite his advanced age and no intention to second-guess any of the strategic decisions Harris made in her hurry-up campaign. Which is like setting out to solve a murder by ignoring the weapon used and skipping past the cause of death. Curious, indeed. Still, there was predictable outrage when Martin went back on his promise. \"This is a very bad decision that reeks of the caution and complacency that brought us to this moment,\" Dan Pfeiffer, an alumnus of the Obama White House, posted on social media. “The people who volunteered, donated and voted deserve to know what went wrong,” Jamal Simmons, a former Harris vice presidential advisor, told the Hill newspaper. “The DNC should tell them.” In 2013, Republicans commissioned a similar after-action assessment following Mitt Romney's loss to President Obama. It was scathing in its blunt-force commentary. The 98-page report said a smug, uncaring, ideologically rigid party was turning off voters with stale policies that had changed little in decades and was unhelpfully projecting an image that alienated minorities and young voters. Among its recommendation, the postmortem called on the party to develop “a more welcoming brand of conservatism\" and suggested an extensive set of “inclusion” proposals for minority groups, including Latinos, Asians and African Americans. (DEI, anyone?) \"Unless changes are made,\" the report concluded, \"it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans to win another presidential election in the near future.\" Trump, of course, won the White House three years later doing precisely none of what the report recommended. Which suggests the Democratic autopsy, buried or otherwise, is not likely to matter a whole lot when voters go to the polls. (It's the affordability, stupid.) That said, Martin should have released the appraisal and not just because of the time and effort invested. There was already Democratic hostility toward the chairman, particularly among donors unhappy with his leadership and performance, and his entombing of the autopsy report won't help. Martin gave his word, and breaking it is a needless distraction and blemish on the party. Besides, a bit of thoughtful self-reflection is never a bad thing. It's hard to look forward when you've got your head stuck in the sand.","summary":"A decision by the party chairman to bury an autopsy report on the 2024 election has sparked anger among partisans.

I’d see him out at clubs and at restaurants. He’s a big goofball. Well, he was. That all changed.”\n\nIn the same interview, Clooney – who has been playing journalist Edward R Murrow in a recent stage adaptation of his 2005 film Good Night, and Good Luck – criticised Trump’s battles with the US media.\n\nReferring to the recent CBS News and ABC News settlements with Trump, Clooney said: “If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go f*** yourself,’ we wouldn’t be where we are in the country. That’s simply the truth.”\n\nEarlier this year, prominent Democrat donor Clooney said “everybody” worries about being targeted by Trump’s administration, but added that won’t stop him from standing up for what he believes in.\n\n“Sure, everybody worries about it,” Clooney told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. “But you know, if you spend your life worrying about things, then you won’t do things.”\n\n“I want to be able to look at my kids in the eye and say where we stood and what we did at certain times in history, and I have no problem with that,” he said.\n\nIt emerged last week that Clooney, his wife Amal and their eight-year-old twins have been granted French citizenship.\n\nEarlier this year, Clooney talked about leaving Los Angeles for a quieter life in France and why he felt that it worked out better for his children.\n\n“I was worried about raising our kids in LA, in the culture of Hollywood. I felt like they were never going to get a fair shake at life. France, they kind of don’t give a s*** about fame,” he told Esquire in October.\n\n“I don’t want them to be walking around worried about paparazzi. I don’t want them being compared to somebody else’s famous kids.”\n\nClooney and his wife bought a house in Provence for $8.3m in 2021.

Their hatred of President Donald Trump, conservatives and even the late Charlie Kirk defined 2025. Still, there were some who outdid everyone else in their quest to be, drumroll, please, the Most Annoying Person of 2025. I ignored people who made news saying just one idiotic comment or who are just obscure media personalities. (Like Matthew Dowd who lost his bogus MSNBC job for his comments bashing Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk for \"hate speech\" after Kirk had been murdered.) 1. He was funny 20 years ago No one deserves the top spot on this list more than \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" host Jimmy Kimmel. Most late-night programs have faded from view as their hosts have turned them into orgies of Trump-bashing. But Kimmel excels at hating conservatives so much that he almost qualifies to be a male cast member of \"The View.\" (Yep, they’re here, too.) JIMMY KIMMEL CHOKES UP AS HE THANKS VIEWERS FOR SUPPORT AFTER 'HARD YEAR' Kimmel gained more attention for saying vile things and fighting Trump than for anything funny. Former \"Late Show\" host David Letterman termed Kimmel, \"the leader of the resistance,\" and Kimmel later cried millionaire tears because he had a \"hard year.\" He earned a temporary suspension with one of the worst comments about the Kirk assassination, saying, \"We hit some new lows over the weekend, with the MAGA gang desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and everything they can to score political points from it.\" He was wrong, of course, but we are used to that. Trump later said, \"Jimmy Kimmel was horrible,\" and who am I to disagree with my president? 2. You knew they’d make the list If the annoying people of Earth have a home base, it’s not some secluded island fortress, it’s ABC’s \"The View.\" The gaggle of hosts — from leftist moderator Whoopi Goldberg to crackpot Joy Behar to pretend conservative Alyssa Farah Griffin — is a reminder that quantity is not quality. This year, they pretended radical Islamic Iran wasn’t worse than the U.S. (Goldberg); claimed using the National Guard to stop crime was \"a pretext to stop the next election!\" (Behar); and compared the election of Trump to … Hitler. (Behar: \"The Germans voted also. Just saying.\") The show has become such an embarrassment that the TV show \"Landman\" mocked it for being a, \"bunch of pissed off millionaires bitching about how much they hate millionaires, Trump, and men, and you, and me, and everybody else they got a bee up their ass about.\" \"The View\" has gone from mindless propaganda to a punchline. 3. The first of the pod people If you’re lucky, you’ve never heard of podcaster Jennifer Welch. Just imagine a ghoul-like figure from your deepest nightmares, then give her blonde hair and a microphone. She’s one of the two co-hosts for the \"I’ve Had It\" podcast, and it’s well-named. She and her co-host first appeared in the Bravo series \"Sweet Home Oklahoma,\" which no one ever heard of. But now, the press loves her because she says hateful things about conservatives. CNN’s profile of Welch quotes her calling Trump a, \"fat, fascist f--- who’s ruining everything for everybody.\" The New York Times notes, \"‘Patriots, gaytriots, theytriots, Blacktriots and browntriots,’ is how Ms. Welch greets the listeners of their primary podcast.\" She left out morontriots who must make up the bulk of her audience. Welch made news calling Kirk’s widow Erika a \"grifter\" and TPUSA said that comment was, \"beneath contempt.\" I’m sure Welch will say worse in 2026 because the media reward her bile with support. CNN said she and her co-host are, \"two women who love their country and aren’t afraid to name and shame people.\" See what I mean? 4. More pod-ish people Podcaster antisemite Nick Fuentes and Twitch antisemite Hasan Piker showed the world that the worst users of social media have one thing in common — hatred. Both of them have dominated the social world and been everywhere in the media as civilized society reacts in horror. Fuentes calls himself an admirer of communist Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin and says Nazi dictator Adolph Hitler was \"really f---ing cool.\" Pretty much on brand. Piker, when he’s not being accused of giving his dog electric shocks, spends his time saying offensive things, like, \"America deserved 9/11.\" He later walked it back because of the backlash, but he still has millions of followers on multiple platforms. Fox News did an analysis of what he says, and it’s so vile, I don’t want to repeat it. He’s all across major media. The Times called him, \"A Progressive Mind in a Body Made for the ‘Manosphere.’\" The press is desperate to recreate their own Joe Rogan and this is the best they've got.

The owner of Amazon and the Washington Post sent his then-fiancée Lauren Sanchez, and five other famous women, into near-space. Perry is in the cool kids' club, so she got to go. The singer actually vowed to \"put the ‘a--’ in astronaut\" and made a fool of herself when she landed, kneeling and kissing the ground because of an 11-minute rocket trip. She was quoted declaring, \"I feel super connected to love.\" That must have been true. She is now dating her own space cadet, former lefty Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 6. Friday the 13th Cynthia Erivo is 2025’s it gal. She’s everywhere and impossible not to see. As NBC put it, she’s \"Proudly Bald and Has No Eyebrows.\" Throw in nails like Freddy Krueger and the bisexual star is everything the media want in a celebrity — weird and alternative. She’s the star of the two \"Wicked\" movies and even played Jesus in the Hollywood Bowl (naturally) version of the musical \"Jesus Christ Superstar.\" Erivo revels in her unusual look, even shaving her own eyebrows, \"Whenever I'm talking to my makeup artist, I tell her that I just want to look like a pretty thumb.\" Yeah, I can’t top that.

I have lived my entire career a life of service, and it's in my bones.\" Harris released her book, \"107 Days\" and managed to annoy Democrats and Republicans about equally with her alleged recollection of events. At least former President Richard Nixon was nice enough to tell us, \"You won’t have Nixon to kick around anymore.\" Harris will make us endure more garbled responses before she goes gently into that good night of her career.

He undermined Operation Sindoor, repeatedly violated all red lines on Kashmir, aligned himself with Pakistan, blamed India for his failure to end the Russia-Ukraine war, and strengthened China’s hand in the Indo-Pacific.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Trump topped these actions with 50 per cent tariffs on India — the highest for any country.\nCommentators and officials in India misread Trump and his Maga movement, believing his second term would mirror his first, according to Anil Raman, head of the US programme at the Takshashila Institution.\nMore from World Prisoners go home: Thailand frees 18 Cambodian soldiers captured in July as ceasefire sticks From Arab Spring to Yemen strikes: Saudi Arabia, UAE go from brothers to rivals in 14 years In sharp contrast, Pakistan’s relationship with the United States has completely changed in Trump’s second term. While former President Joe Biden had shoved the regime into irrelevance, not holding even a call with a Pakistani leader in four years, Trump has hosted Army chief Asim Munir twice at the White House and signed a slew of deals.\nUnlike India, Pakistan understood early that Trump’s second term would not be driven by ideology but by the pursuit of personal enrichment, says Raman.\nFor Pakistan’s kleptocratic hybrid regime of Munir and Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, promising Trump and his friends riches through critical mineral and cryptocurrency deals —and boosting his megalomania with unabashed sycophancy— came easily. India’s political culture would not have allowed any leader to do that.\nQuick Reads View All Mali and Burkina Faso ban US nationals in tit-for-tat response to Washington’s travel curbs Setback for Trump in Iowa: Democrat Renee Hardman blocks Republican supermajority And therein lies the fundamental shift in Trump’s second term. For more than three decades in the post-Cold War era, the India-US relationship rested on the pursuit of a mutually beneficial partnership that built upon common ground and sought middle ground in case of divergences. Trump has ended the underpinning principle of mutuality.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD The year India-US ties unravelled In the India-US relationship, some years stand out.\nIn 2008, the Indian parliament backed the then government in what was essentially a vote on the India-US civilian nuclear deal. In 2016, PM Narendra Modi announced in the US Congress that the India-US relationship had “overcome the hesitations of history”. In 2023, Biden hosted Modi for a state visit that marked the crowning moment of bilateral ties.\nThen there is 2025 that echoes 1971 when the United States dispatched its navy to help Pakistan in a war with India — and support the Islamist genocide in East Pakistan.\nIn trade and economy, Trump hit India where it hurt most.\nWith new tariffs, Trump raised duties on critical seafood and textile sectors to more than 60 per cent. Both sectors are mass employers — textile is the second-largest employer after agriculture, and millions depend on shrimp farming in Andhra Pradesh — so any loss of exports was bound to have economic as well as political fallout as these are politically sensitive sectors and regions.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD While the Modi government managed the impact of tariffs by seeking alternatives to the US export market in Europe and East Asia, the worst fallout has been in geopolitics where India has lost its principal partner in tackling China.\nFor more than 20 years, India had been central to American strategy to counter China’s rise. As part of his international efforts, Biden had joined hands with Modi to elevate Quad as the fulcrum to tackle China in the Indo-Pacific.\nIn the past 11 months, Trump has dismantled that contest and struck a compromise with Xi Jinping — after failing in the trade war and admitting defeat. Abandoning Quad, Trump has formed a ‘G-2’ with China.\nTrump’s approach to China is contradictory at best and self-defeating at worst, says Sriparna Pathak, Professor and Associate Dean at Jindal School of International Affairs (JSIA) at OP Jindal Global University.\nPathak notes that while Trump promised to withdraw resources from Europe to address the threat from China, he ended up conceding defeat in a trade war and entering into a partnership with China that’s essentially an act of self-harm.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD “Trump wants the United States and China to pursue a mutually advantageous trade and economic policy, but that’s self-defeating as China does not have any principle of mutuality. The ‘G-2’ will fail because China does not want to be America’s equal. It wants to beat it to become the world’s sole superpower,” says Pathak, a specialist in Chinese studies.\nEvery single decision Trump has taken has emboldened China — and complicated the world for India.\nBy abandoning Quad and withdrawing from the Indo-Pacific, Trump has incentivised China to ramp up aggression in the region. By essentially accepting China’s stand on Taiwan, he has emboldened Xi to be aggressive on all frontiers. By withdrawing restrictions on the sale of advanced American artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China, he has paved the way for the loss of technological superiority and handed China the roadmap to overtake American tech giants. By ending the foreign aid programme, he made way for China to expand its footprint and acquire soft power that the United States had acquired over many decades.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD In 11 months, Trump has completely eroded trust built over decades in every sphere from economics to geopolitics, says Raman.\n“For a long time, India-US ties sought mutual economic growth and tackled the Chinese threat together, but that’s now a thing of the past. Now India cannot count on Trump for anything. Unlike 2020 when the first Trump administration helped India with supplies in the standoff with China or in 2017 when it gave diplomatic support during the Doklam standoff, India cannot expect any support now as Trump has joined hands with China,” says Raman.\nA long shot at restoration As the only saving grace, the defence and security partnership has shown a semblance of continuity in the India-US relationship.\nAt mid-levels, Indian and US officials have continued to engage, such as holding the 2+2 Intersessional Dialogue in August and the India-US Joint Working Group on Counter-Terrorism and 7th Designations Dialogue convening earlier this month. In April, the United States also extradited Tahawwur Rana, a key accused in the 26/11 case, to India — even though the process began in the previous administration. India and the United States signed the 10-Year Defence Framework.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD But considering the extent of the damage, these are not actions that mend the relationship but merely keep engagement alive and leave a possibility for a future administration in Washington to restore trust. That would be a tall task considering the extent to which Trump has broken the relationship — and has three more years to worsen it.\nMore than India, however, the mistaken approach will harm the United States.\n“In the long term, Trump’s policies will severely harm American power and standing in the world as allies and partners like India or Japan adapt, and the United States finds itself completely alone while its adversaries stay together. But he will not be around to face consequences. If he really had America’s interests in mind, he would have never approved the sale of Nvidia’s advanced AI chips to China. There is no rationale for the approval other than enrichment,” says Raman.\nMoreover, Pathak says the harm Trump is doing is institutional, not impulsive, and could be difficult for a future president to undo easily.\nSTORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD “Everything from tariffs to the alignment with China is an institutional shift, not just Trump’s personal whims that could be downplayed. For the next three years, the India-US relationship will remain distrustful despite continuing engagement. While a future president could restore trust, the concern in India is that the damage might become too institutional to be reversed with a change of guard,” says Pathak.","url":"https://www.firstpost.com/world/india-us-relationship-2025-donald-trump-tariffs-operation-sindoor-ceasefire-ukraine-russia-war-china-g2-deal-13964343.html","image":"https://images.firstpost.com/uploads/2025/08/Firstpost-2025-08-09T085831.713-2025-08-5133cedd77f0d9f0d2a7300608a1885c.jpg?im=FitAndFill=(1200,675)","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 09:39:01","author":"Madhur Sharma","authors":["Madhur Sharma"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":390295414,"title":"Howie Carr: Brace for a New Year full of fraud and fakes","text":"From the mysterious East, now comes Carrnac the Magnificent with his infallible predictions for the New Year, 2026.\n\nFor those infidels keeping score at home, exactly one year ago today, Carrnac gazed into his crystal ball and presciently predicted both the acquittal of Karen Read and the conviction of Tania Fernandes Anderson.\n\nPerhaps not the toughest calls in the world, Sahib.

I recently watched a very old NL interview – Abhinandan with Jai Bhagwan Goel, which was quite witty. This guy was denied the MLA ticket in the recent Delhi elections from a constituency near mine and this is what I saw a few days ago. Looks like he is still trying to remain as relevant as possible. Thought you might/might not find it interesting. ***Dheeraj Hello everyone, In the past two Haftas, Abhinandan discussed anarchy and recently about power. I was recently reading Noam Chomsky on the same subject and just wanted to quote him here: \"The core of the anarchist tradition, as I understand it, is that power is always illegitimate, unless it proves itself to be legitimate. So the burden of proof is always on those who claim that some authoritarian hierarchic relation is legitimate. If they can't prove it, then it should be dismantled... It's the responsibility of those who exercise power to show that somehow it's legitimate. It's not the responsibility of anyone else to show that it's illegitimate. It's illegitimate by assumption, if it's a relation of authority among human beings which places some above others. Unless you can give a strong argument to show that it's right, you've lost.\"Thank you.***Rohit​I just watched a recent episode where the topic of discussion was the Delhi bombing, and everyone was kind of shocked that these people were educated doctors and still did this kind of thing. But why are we still shocked that educated people believe in this type of stuff? Education doesn't mean you'll become a rational human being. If that were the case, the caste system and patriarchy would have been long gone. Also, Dr. Hedgewar founded the RSS, and Savarkar and Jinnah both studied law in Britain. Why do we value degrees and professions so much? In this country, IAS officers take dowry, and women get surgeries to get a lighter skin tone or become 'virgin' again in order to get married. So let's not do this mainstream argument that if someone is educated or earns well he/she must be a good person. Ps. My rant is over ***VivekHow are collapsing bridges and frequent flooding not an issue in Bihar. How is Nitish not directly held responsible for all of them? Am I focusing on something that doesn't matter to the people?***TrithankarReally enjoyed Hafta 562 as always – just wanted to share two quick thoughts. First, spending almost the entire deep-dive on Zohran Mamdani felt a bit disproportionate. It’s an interesting story, but with headlines like Delhi’s air crisis, the railway and bus accidents, the Bihar elections, and voter-fraud allegations in Haryana, those felt more urgent and India-relevant. Mamdani could’ve been a brief segment, but as one of only two main discussions, it felt a bit over-weighted.Second, around 1:15:18, Ms. Sabrina said, “It’s like free speech. Free speech also means you can say things that are hateful and terrible.” I wish the panel had drawn a clearer line between free speech and hate speech. Free speech includes the right to offend — and that’s important. But hate speech is different: it’s when the powerful use speech to marginalize or incite violence against the powerless. That distinction really matters, especially today.***Raymond Andrews Hi team,I am a paying subscriber and have a query. On NL Hafta, Sreenivasan Jain said the Congress is dead in Bihar. Please let me know how he arrived at this conclusion. Was a survey done or was any analysis done on the campaign of congress and other parties? Was this a statement derived from a study or was it a mere impression?***Geetika Hi NL Team,First, thank you for your work and for keeping our faith in journalism. I waited two weeks hoping someone would raise concerns about the Gaza–Israel discussion in Hafta 559. Please forgive the length – I’ll try to stay concise. Dr. Jandig’s opening remark – “If liberals and the woke cared about women’s rights.” This was deeply disappointing. Liberals have stood for women’s rights, unlike conservatives. It was unfortunate that no one, except the guest, challenged her. Also, having someone affiliated with a university in Haifa made neutrality questionable from the outset.Abhinandan’s reaction – His horror at what students at Columbia University said about Israel seemed misplaced. The real concern should have been how the protests were suppressed and how students were immediately branded anti-Semitic. Criticizing Israel or the IDF is not anti-Semitism.There are numerous videos of IDF soldiers mocking victims, rummaging through Palestinian women’s belongings, common Israeli people blocking aid, attacking homes in the West Bank, pouring cement into wells, and assaulting the elderly. Yet, much of this brutality is ignored, while anyone speaking out is vilified.Even more disturbing are the protests in Israel supporting the soldiers accused of rape and the platforms given to those defending such acts. The woman who leaked the assault video was arrested, while others have proposed laws permitting violence — even rape and killing — against Palestinians.It was painful to hear the conversation equate both sides and lean toward Israeli talking points and also how it wouldn't be fair to expect jews to live under Palestinian regime . It felt as though Abhinandan had, perhaps unknowingly, internalized that propaganda. How long will Israel continue to use the Holocaust as cover while committing atrocities without remorse or accountability?Thank you for reading and for continuing to do important work.Best,Geetika***Sajeev Khan Hi NL Team, I recently travelled to Bengaluru for a couple of months. One of the most terrifying experiences is that people are driving on the wrong side without any fear or shame. But with utter disdain for fellow citizens. I can understand if delivery boys take shortcuts. But this is done by techies, senior and middle aged people, even families with young children. This makes day to day driving a very dangerous activity. Please can we talk about this in NL Hafta to raise citizen awareness so that we all acknowledge that this is dangerous behavior.Driving on the wrong side is equivalent to a person waving a sword in a busy street.Hope this wrong behavior is not replicated in other cities Sajeev-From a tiny part of Kerala***Vijay Hello Folks, Just wanted to know whether the TMR sessions for 2025 would be available in podcast format as I prefer the same over the YouTube video format. Also with the Bihar state election results do you think the opposition would use vote chhori and SIR as a crutch now onwards or could they do a deep dive into voter turnout, gather CCTV footage and find out if there was any this election? where would they put limited resources on the future SIR and state elections or this one? Need more of Jayshree's rants!!Thanks, Vijay***Abubakr Siddiqui Again I want tell Abhinandan as Indian Muslim that I didn't come from any other country to India, we are from hereBut Zionist didn't belong to Palestine, they came from other countries, some of them bought land from Palestinian but most of them came and occupied land of Arabs line they are doing in West Bank right nowApart from this I have a question: In the film industry a producer is someone who gives money for film making. What does a producer mean in a news office setting? ***Kezia The funny thing about Jemima Rodrigues and the other women of the Indian team winning the semi-finals is that now the same sexists are now posting memes about how these girls shut sexist mouths. But what I also wish to point out is that these women are now being held up as role models for feminism - this is the \"sports, military feminism\" that sees women like Col. Sophia Qureshi or Jemima Rodrigues as the only true feminists because they make the country proud while not proactively disturbing the social order of the day-to-day life here. The turnaround we see in the social media narrative is because it is comfortable to accept their achievements while also using it as fodder to deflect from deep-rooted sexist and misogynistic beliefs. Of course, I am only talking about it in the context of social media, where such gender wars happen - in the real world, such a divide is much less pronounced. ***AnonymousOn the recent PK interview: While I generally appreciate your journalistic rigour, this conversation focussed more on challenging his ideas than engaging with them constructively. Much of the questioning appeared to revolve around why his solutions can’t fix the entirety of the problem. His approach of piloting small, measurable initiatives for the poorest majority is both pragmatic and necessary — and the crux of the counterarguments seemed to be why not do these for everyone. Given how little progress throwing money at the problem has produced, his focus on smaller, outcome-driven experiments deserves fairer engagement.Because he is willing to discuss concrete solutions, he seemed to face a higher threshold of skepticism than most politicians. He may have had a better interview if he’d simply hand-waved away the issues, and that shouldn’t be the outcome.That said, I deeply value Newslaundry’s commitment to independent journalism and critical inquiry.***Bhavesh Bhatt Hi NL Team,As a decade-long subscriber, I wanted to share my thoughts on Vasu’s interview with Retd. Justice Chandrachud. While Vasu is an experienced journalist, I felt his approach was too combative, which can make interviewees defensive and less forthcoming (reminds me of K.Thapar). I don’t understand the widespread celebration of the interview – Vasu didn’t “expose” the Chief Justice; the rationale behind the judgment was not spoken aloud but obvious. Expecting a different judgment, like equal land distribution or museum, seems unrealistic, that would have prolonged the dispute. The judgment to hand over land to trust was pragmatic, aiming to resolve a long-standing issue. As Josey said that it was merely an unarticulated explanation by Justice. I’d love to see more in-depth interviews by NL’s own team rather than celebrities. This can strengthen the NL brand. Please try not to take your journalistic and business decision to cater to the echo chamber and neoliberal subscribers.Bhavesh***Harry Singh Hello,I might have missed a nuanced discussion on gender diversity issues that was being talked about some time back in this show. But that's ok. I'm writing to recommend the book \"Adaptable\" by Herman Pontzez, specifically chapter 7, to any of you still interested in learning more on this topic. This is a great book that talks about our fascinating body in a layman friendly language. While chapter 7 focuses on gender diversity, the rest of the book is a good read as well. There are very interesting insights into the debate of nature vs nurture. It also addresses the controversial topic of eugenics with ease and neatly bursts a great number of myths around the race based differences in humans. The book also does a very decent job of explaining race as a social construct and not biological. Regards, Harry ***Rahul SethiaThis episode was quite disappointing on two counts:1. If you quote biased Western mainstream media, then you should expect them to do the same for Indian news. There are others like Breaking Points, Glenn Greenwalt, Dropsite which are subscriber based similar to Newslaundry. 2. Dr. Jehangir should have disclosed all his conflicts of interest, while painting a false / incomplete picture of the situation.***K. Jayaram Whenever the discussion turns to Israel and Gaza, Abhinandan somehow manages to throw sand in the wheels. Contrary to his view, the real counterpoint to Western mainstream media isn’t random social media chatter or TikTok clips, but independent digital outlets like The Greyzone, The Intercept, Mondoweiss, Breaking Points, Drop Site News, The Katie Halper Show, The Electronic Intifada, and Le Monde Diplomatique. These platforms effectively challenge the propaganda pushed by the NYT, CNN, and BBC. As for the professor from Jindal, his affiliations make it clear where his views lie. Even so, his remarks on Zionism are truly worthy of the ADL. On a positive note, it’s always a pleasure to hear Shardool, Jayashree, and Manisha for their thoughtful insights. My observations aren’t casual; they stem from detailed analysis, linked below. https://www.theindiaforum.in/politics/making-sense-western-media-bias-reporting-gazahttps://www.theindiaforum.in/politics/genocide-gaza-revenge-retribution-or-means-end***Vivek Ahokan Hi NL team,I have a suggestion to make. Can you please add an option so that when complementary subscriptions are gained through NL Sena, it is added as a voucher that can be applied when needed instead of it getting queued to the pending subscriptions list. My pending vouchers are valid till MAR 2027. and TNM/NL subscription is queued after it. There have been times when I've forgotten to subscribe and my pending subscriptions have been activated. I would have preferred to buy a subscription when I can, and keep the vouchers for a rainy day.This is frustrating because every time I contribute to NL sena, I know new ones will be queued and applied instead of the ones that I bought. I do not like the solution provided where I was to open a new account. and link my joint membership to the new one.Attached screenshot of the current queue for your reference.Sorry I'm forwarding it to podcasts, since I didn't get a response from the subscription address.***Anonymous I deeply appreciate the work you do. I’ve been meaning to raise this for some time, though with Muslims being targeted in India and the ongoing conflict in Gaza, it has never felt like the right moment.The issue I want to raise is the repressive treatment of women within Islam. Are we ever going to have an honest conversation about it? While all religions have gender-related issues, the way Islam is interpreted in many communities results in restrictions and oppression that are particularly severe.I’m not asking just for the panel’s perspective, I’d like to hear from readers, scholars, and community members as well. It’s time to confront these uncomfortable truths openly rather than avoiding them for fear of controversy.This is not about attacking a faith, but about critically examining how their interpretations impact half the population.Thank you for all your work.Proud Subscriber,Anonymous*** Asgar Shaikh Let’s address some biases from week 559:- Suhasini pointed out that the Taliban Minister accepted that women’s education is not haram, but the panellists linked Islam to Taliban actions. Islam promotes education for all genders and heights. Would you link the GOI’s education budget reduction to Hinduism?-Dr. Khinvraj should call out loud names of everyone killed by Israel last week.-Forget forefathers and history, we are accountable for our own actions. All able Israeli citizens mandatorily serve in the IDF, unless they reject.-While armed resistance to foreign occupation is acceptable in international law, lasting peace needs rejection of hate and violence.-All countries have dress codes. Iran enforces Islamic law requiring women to cover their hair in public, but everyone has freedom (religion, education & career).. Iran is a friendly BRICS member, and India has invested in the Chabahar port. The USA’s actions are hostile to both nations.***Aditya Naryanan (AI Summary)Dear Newslaundry Team,As a long-time subscriber, I admire your work but must offer constructive feedback on the latest Hafta episode's Gaza discussion. It overly focused on Hamas's violence, sidelining Israel's disproportionate war crimes, settler violence in Gaza/West Bank since the 1948 Nakba, and decades of apartheid.Abhinandan Sekhri's analogy to the US civil rights movement was poorly informed – structural racism persisted post-slavery via resistance, not oppressor conscience. Non-violence requires humanity, impossible amid Gaza's starvation policy (Ashour et al., The Lancet, 2025). Dr. Khinvraj Jangid sounded like an Israeli apologist, echoing Oslo myths ignoring Palestinian voices (Arafah in Diwan; UC Press, Springer, JSTOR refs).Your take on antisemitism lacked nuance (Hundred Years' War on Palestine, Khalidi; Shehada interview). Jayashree showed moral clarity. Please research topics and guests better.Best,Aditya***Akshay Marathe (AI Summary)Dear Newslaundry Team,Quick thoughts on the latest Hafta Gaza episode: The \"expertise\" felt like pro-Israel propaganda, lacking balance except for Jayashree, whose critique was dismissed. Abhinandan's rebuttals missed the mark:1. Nazi rallies in the West don't justify uprooting Palestinians for Europe's guilt—Israel exists, but why at their expense?2. His India-Muslim invaders analogy inverted Jayashree's point: a secular one-state Palestine mirrors equal-rights India (even if aspirational).Dr. Jangid's \"Hamas dug its own grave\" claim got no pushback, ignoring Israel's role in fostering Hamas (Netanyahu's admissions) to block one-state solutions. West Bank settlements persist without Hamas— what's the justification? After 70,000 Gazan deaths, labeling Israel genocidal is overdue. Indian Islamophobia hunts Muslim villains, but Israel's actions fuel antisemitism by conflating Jews with the state, endangering global Jews.Best,Akshay***Abubakr SiddiquiLast week, Mr Abhinandan said that if Israel doesn’t have the right to exist, then it’s like in India Muslim don't have to exist. Correct me if I am wrong, we Indian Muslims didn't came from Arab or Persian land, our great grandpa I don't know which generation convert to islam but they were Indian On other side of your opinion Zionist were not in Palestine they came from other countries, take homes of Palestinian expelled them, take their land and kill them, then Palestine started to move Gaza, Gaza is a refugee camp. I want your opinion on Kashmiri Pandits. What you think Mr. Abhinandan? Should they return to their home in Kashmir or should they live like Palestinian in refugee camps? ***Harnek KangHi NL team, I haven’t missed a single NL Podcast since year’s and I always support your endeavour. I just have one SHIKAYAT I:E whenever you discuss about CASTE related matters like CJI Gawai, suicide in Haryana (this week), I request you get a SC/ST or Ambedkerite scholar on the panel because we Savarnas have a mental barrier which deprive us of feeling caste issues. I want to recommend a book called MEET THE SAVARNAS BY Ravikant Kisana to understand this. Thanks.***Joseph Bear (AI Summary)Dear Hafta Team,Just finished the latest episode and wanted to share quick feedback – no need to feature it.Abhinandan noted US healthcare as a big election issue, comparing it favourably to India and praising American voters. (As an American, I'd say the \"stupidity\" rep is earned.) He equated it with public health concern, but that's inaccurate: it's mainly about affordability of care and insurance.The US – despite its wealth – is the only developed nation without guaranteed healthcare. Without insurance, it's prohibitively expensive for all but the richest. Even insured, costs and access remain high.In short, \"healthcare\" is a cost-of-living issue, not a lofty public health worry. Thought I'd correct the misconception.Thanks for your great work!Joe Bear***DhirajThis is in response to Hafta x South Central. I find it hard to agree with anyone who says we are doomed. I also find it hard that if I were to consider Newslaundry and The News Minute as the most innovative news platforms, they are not able to burst the Godi Media cycle. People forget that it was really social media that got Obama’s second term and the right caught on almost a decade later. Your collective needs to sit down and think how you can take advantage of the present AI hype to scale a product that bursts the bubble of right wing superiority ! I don’t know how but I believe you can ! The PhD subscribers may have ideas! ***Soumya Hi NL team! The intersection podcast with TNM was great. In this age of social media, only sensational content can have large viewership, for eg. Big Boss etc. Our country is so diverse that real life issues of one section of society don't bother another. In such a case, subscription-based journalism will have its limitations. During Bapu's time, independence was one issue which united the whole country against an oppressive regime. That is why, he was able to touch the emotions of millions of Indians using his journalism. In today's India, it's tough to find such an uniting issue. But, I suggest you guys carry on the good work. Continue bringing out voices of each and every marginalized community. Your job must be to uphold the values of Bapu and slowly the subscriber base will increase. All good things take time to be appreciated by millions!What are your thoughts on Prashant Kishore? Can Sreenivasan Jain interview him?***Sengupta Hi NL Hafta, You are the reason I am an NL subscriber. Bold and excellent work! Keep it up! In Hafta 556, Pooja Prasanna comments on Indians working abroad as (in quotes) \"going and taking the easy route\". While she must be widely connected and hears many experiences, this statement has bias, sweeping generalisation, and a misrepresentation of the many struggles abroad that an immigrant has to face, irrespective of skill level or profession. Whether in India or abroad, one must work hard and navigate all odds to achieve excellence and success in one's work. It is not 'easy'; in fact, it can be a real hard deal to build a life and career abroad from scratch! I just wanted to voice my concern; that's all. Warm regards, Sengupta ***Shafi KamalDear NL team, Your Chandrachud interview was amazing, it even made me renew my subscription (had lapsed earlier due to technicalities). I’d love for you to get Prashant Kishor on. He’s speaking to everyone except my favourite news org! Please question him not on caste or political opponents, but his Bihar plans – distress migration, CD ratio, schools, what simulations has he run, and do they hold up? An educated challenge from you could really help people. If you’ve already done it, apologies. Thanks for all the work. Love you!***Nikhil BarariaHi, I wholly agree with Abhinandan on the point that we (urban class) do not want to pay for news that questions us straight away. The public space takeover including footpaths is very rampant across all major cities. There are people who say, 'Acha hai private ho gaya, public footpaths toh aise bhi we can't use.' This sounds scary to me as a concerned citizen.Lastly, I would like to thank you both for the awesome work and effort you put in each day. Gives me hope that the 4th pillar of democracy, although crooked, still exists.Thanks and Cheers, Nikhil B***Manan ShahHi Hafta and South Central team, On the topic of the revival of democracy, I think one point was missed. As more and more people get educated, which is happening, as slow as it might be. But more percentage of the next generation is educated with every successive generation. Once we hit a tipping point, the revival of democracy will be unhindered. I do believe education will play that role, even if the education is not superb, even a decent primary education will eventually pave the way. Best,Manan ***Aditya RameshDear NL and TNM team,I loved Saturday's discussion and loved the spirit each person brought to it. Jozy – a quiet sense of optimism from conversations within, Dhanya – politician in the making, Sudipto – the everyday matters and voicing a 'New India', Abhinandan – Dilli ka munda vibes, and Manisha – embracing technology and understanding that fatigue will catch up to the Indian population. This is the hope and spirit we need.Long time subscriber,Aditya***Anonymous (AI Summary)Dear NL Team,I’d like to stay anonymous. In the H1B debate, discussion usually centres on innovation gaps and business opportunities in India, but a crucial factor is overlooked: social freedom. I’m an IIT Kanpur graduate with a PhD from a top US university, now a postdoctoral researcher. I wanted to return to India as a professor, but as a gay man I cannot legally marry or have children there, whereas many Western countries allow both. India’s Supreme Court recently declined to recognise same-sex marriage or civil unions, and queer couples also lack equal access to adoption and surrogacy.​The H1B situation is painful, and alternative visas are difficult or lack clear citizenship paths, making other countries more attractive. Until India offers equal rights, it cannot realistically expect much talent to return. It is not always about salaries or infrastructure; I would move back in a heartbeat if I could marry there.***Korak Saha Hafta 556: Your H1B visa was all around techie world, in the process you forgot there is an uncapped H1B that actually helps universities and national labs to hire the crema de la crema from all over. We come here to contribute to science and tech development and when we shine you cheer for us. However it doesn't make sense to mock us (saying face the daily issue back home) at this difficult point and was in bad taste. Agree with Abhinandan that it is not about patriotism, it is about you being free to do the work you want to do to the best of your abilities. There is a rationale behind this yes, but there are real lives at stake here too. Thanks and keep up the good work of subscription journalism. Good discussions btw.***Erbil Hi guys,This has been on my mind since your episode on the Emergency. Growing up, I often heard from my family that the Emergency was “good” – the only time the country was lawful and orderly. That changed after I listened to your episode, and later your Let’s Talk About- Punjab series. Thank you for that.Since then, I’ve been wondering: how do we know what information to trust about any event? With the Emergency, I wanted to learn more, but couldn’t find sources that felt impartial, rather than pushing one narrative or another.The same happens with current events – like the Nepal protests, where news, Instagram, and Reddit all had different accounts. Even with Ladakh, I’ve seen conflicting versions.So my question is: what are reliable sources to fact-check and verify information – even your podcast – without falling into partisan narratives?Thanks.***Kumud Shankar Hi Team, A sincere request. Can the NL team give some space to reporting by young independent journalists. The gruesome murder of Mukesh Chandrakhar and now Rajiv Pratap shows how unsafe India is for journalists. While people like Paranjoy Guha and Ajit Anjum have a support base, the young & independent ones have no one to stand for them. Eg in Charcha, Atul covers a report of the week. Why not start including these journalists? Or just create a tracker on the website for young journalists to update their investigation & threat perception. ***Mohd Salman Hi NL team, It is incredible that the Honourable Justice DY Chandrachud went on a promo tour to so many people but the interview that exposed him the most was the paywalled one. Content is king, and it was a masterclass in patiently doing an interview and letting the subject out himself like that. No doubt you will all have a range of opinions on the subject so I won't say more, except that this interview made a superb case for paying to keep news free. I also liked the call for subscription Ravish made on your behalf in his follow up video to the interview.Congrats again, much respect,Salman ***Abira Barman I am from the North East and stayed in many parts of India for my job. I would like to state a few things. In the 90s when insurgency was at its peak he (Zubeen Garg) would sing Bengali and Hindi songs in BIHU functions even though the use of Hindi and Bengali were banned by ULFA.He had an opinion on political issues unlike most of the celebrities. He openly opposed the ruling government on the CAA issue.I am a Bengali, but the pain I feel over his death is the same as any other Assamese. It's because he was above caste, language or religion.I hope his life and work would make us all good humans.ABIRA BARMAN-subscriber***Sourjya Dutta (AI Summary)Dear NL,On Hafta 556, during the discussion on the 70-year-old woman deported from the US, Abhinandan’s remark that “everything is now peaceful so she should have come back earlier” felt quite callous in the context of asylum seekers. Asylum is not only about escaping political turmoil but also about deep trauma and real threats to life; even if things calm down years later, many may never want to return to the source of that trauma.Also, being without immigration papers in the US is a civil violation, not in itself a criminal offense, and detaining and constricting people for that is deeply problematic.​Harsh Mander, in conversation with Kunal Kamra, has powerfully described the Indian state’s cruel treatment of Rohingya refugees post-Pulwama, which would be important context for a discussion on how India treats immigrants and asylum seekers.​Sincerely,Sourjya DuttaJersey City, NJ***Srinath Sampath Hi Team,Loved the former CJI’s interview and would like to hear Mr. Anand Vardhan’s opinion of the interviewee’s responses from a legal perspective. Mr Jain did well overall but personally, I would’ve preferred a more Mehdi Hasan style “I’m not letting you move forward without a clear response to my last question” approach. Especially when it came to his obfuscation around the lack of evidence to support his “original act of desecration” theory. I’m assuming the former CJI is trying to sell some books at this point in time but I’m always curious why people subject themselves to potential humiliation when there’s friendly media galore to have lollipop interviews with. Srinath Sampath***Deepankar KhasnabishSome thoughts: 1. If Nepal is an inclusive society, and no minority religion to demonise, what are the diversions the elite used, and why so much pent-up frustration? The discussion missed the youth unrest in many neighboring countries. Is there a South Asia thread?2. How India uses this opportunity to correct past attempts to muddy (Madhesis blockade, Hindu Rashtra push), and how it will play in India.3. The size of India should not make us complacent. Studies have shown that around 3.5% of the streets can change regimes. What do we need to do differently?4. Manisha, I think, is closest to Gen Z and has been to Nepal 10 days back, so calling her thoughts “romantic” sounded dismissive to me. Gen Z is also thinking, not just about age.5. Anarchy, my understanding is not no rule of law, but rather where everyone has evolved to self-govern.Warm Regards***Manan ShahThis is actually about the Newsance live hosted by Manisha on 13 Sept. The angle Nepo Kids of politician class and big business and the unavailability of jobs and decent living standards for the population at large – this is essentially exactly what the caste system is. No one is saying it but it’s not just a coincidence that the only Hindu country in the world – Nepal has this inequality. It is systematically designed, and we call it the caste system. I feel It is important to call this out – it is important to call out the caste system every single time anywhere, if we want to get rid of it. That’s how America got rid of slavery, every single instance has to be called out, the system has to be highlighted every single time. I am sad that the media or even protestors are not calling it what it is.Best, Manan ***Vivek Velu Hi, Vivek Velu here. I enjoyed the discussion on China with Akshay Bhambri. I would very much love to hear more from him about Chinese culture and day to day life of a common Chinese citizen as he proposed. I would even vote for it to be a Let's Talk About show.Thank you for the weekly podcast news, this has become a weekly habit for me and a wonderful source for recommendations.On the tech side, I find The News Minute to have a smoother app experience than Newslaundry. Maybe you could collaborate with the tech teams and improve the Newslaundry app. Just some constructive criticism!Keep doing what you are doing, I am privileged to be a subscriber.Kind regards,Vivek Velu***Mala Hi Team, love your work as always. A request to Abhinandan, please stop interrupting Anand when he is speaking. For the last few appearances he has barely been able to get a word in. As a regular listener, I always wait for him to be on the panel as he usually provides good history and context for the topic at hand. Been disappointed at his sidelining these past few weeks despite being on the panels. Keep up the great work though! Warm Regards :)***Madan Sharma Regarding Anand Vardhan’s article about US tariffs he mentioned India's ability to absorb pain. Is it not true that this pain is mainly borne by the poor? Or maybe the poor of India are used to enduring pain all the time?***Shivansh GoyalDear NL team, Great work. Abhinandan, stop interrupting everyone, especially Anand. Best, Shivansh-long time subscriber***Fauji Bhai Greetings!Hafta 554 – Thank you Raman sir, for your comments. You don’t speak much on most episodes; but this time, your remarks on the ‘Gen Z Protests’ in Nepal were very insightful. The point that the media ‘romantisizes’ such events is so true. And I agree that there is more to this than meets the eye. Your humility in saying that you don’t have the necessary ‘sociological context’, in spite of being such an experienced Media Leader – was refreshing and humbling. Please participate more during Hafta discussions!Thank you NL+TNM team for work you all do – and “all the best” for the Media Rumble; which, I truly regret I will not be able to attend – and that’s because you finalized the dates too late (after I had booked tickets for the Dusshera / Dassian Holidays)!Jai Hind to everyone in NL and TNM. Keep up the good work. ***Kumud Shankar Hi Team,Apologies, this is the 2nd letter for the same podcast so it is fine if this is pushed out. Wrt the tariff discussions, I’ve 2 points. 1st pertains to the very Cong style narrative of Nehru getting betrayed by Zhou Enlai. Are we finally seeing Modi match up to Nehru with Trump being his Enlai? Can export subsidies like China mitigate especially when India (Ambani) has benefitted immensely from the lower fuel costs without any impact on consumer price?On Abhinandan’s quipping on power, I believe the apex power trip unique to India is “how you are treated when in jail”? Examples: Manu Sharma, MSG & all the notorious dons. This is what differentiates power from money. An Ambani will do everything to stay out of jail, but a jail will break him. The truly powerful take makes it their Swiss vacation. ***Akanksha HeyI’ve been slowly easing my family into listening to Hafta - I do it by playing it in the car. A couple of weeks ago, my mom and I were listening when Abhinandan mentioned his age. She instantly went, “No way! He doesn’t sound like he’s in his 50s. I thought he was in his 30s!”Thanks guys for making hafta more interesting every episode. ***Simar I love Newsance and the idea of media reporting on media, a similar concept that I follow for news in the west is Ground News. I wonder if you have comments on how they classify blindspots for \"left and right leaning\" news outlets, and if something similar is even possible in the Indian context. It also might be interesting to have their team on a Hafta episode.***Madan SharmaIn reference to Hafta 553 ,why not consider a let me explain series on China? ***UjjwalHi Abhinandan, Hope you and the team are well.I was 22 years old when India Against Corruption started and supported the same, been to jantar mantar etc. Abhinandan I have this question for you: In hindsight don't you feel disappointed/cheated by Anna Hazare? Don't you think he was the stooge of RSS and made us believe that he is doing for the country?I do feel now because in the last 11 years we haven’t heard anything from Anna? Hasn’t he found anything wrong worth speaking/standing for in the last 11 years?Thank you.***Manas Mishra Since my last week hafta was left out, I am writing again. Is vote chori a top down issue or a bottom up issue? Every party has a BLO in SIR in Bihar and the number of rejoinder pleas by them does not match the hype created by Rahul Gandhi.***Amrinder Singh Hundal Hello all,Abhinandan was talking about the uncertainty and ambiguity around Trump’s foreign policy. It could be judged from the fact that Russian diesel is sold to Ukraine via India. Ukraine imports 15 % of Russian diesel through India. So, by the logic of Trump and Navarro , Ukraine is helping the Russian war effort against Ukraine. What madness is this? A question for the panel? Let’s see if it can help us determine which is the best newspaper to read. Whichever newspaper I pick I see Modi glossed all over and then I start feeling nauseated. Which newspaper has the best opinion writers according to you guys?Lastly, after seeing the Gaza genocide live streamed, has the erstwhile defenders of morality and democracy ie, the West , lost all moral ground to lecture global south ? Thanks.***Letter 2Why would Trump get cozy with India when he gets following things from Pakistan?1. Pakistan endorsed Trump getting Nobel Peace prize along with Israel2. Pakistan invested in Trump’s cryptocurrency3. The USA pampered India, so that one day it will be their answer to China. But Rafael planes getting shot down shocked the West and saw that India is no match for the west. So better step back!4. Pakistan has rare earth minerals and it has asked the USA to mine them and keep a major share. This India doesn’t have.5. The USA needs Pakistan to get its arms and military equipment that got stuck in Afghanistan, out of Afghanistan.6. Modi bruised Trump’s ego by not visiting him during the American President’s election campaign.These are things I see that have gotten India away from Trump’s America.***Saanaee NaikHi guys, Fantastic discussion by Akshay Bhambri, please bring him back soon. Also, Abhinandan please stop interrupting speakers while they are giving very interesting responses to very basic yet insightful questions (Manisha's questions in this case). Please consider doing a separate interview with him? Maybe an episode of LTA on China issues? Thank you, Saanaee***Prashant Chadda (AI Summary)Dear Abhinandan and team,Keep up the good work and passion for quality, fact-based journalism. A few observations on the 22 August and 5 September Haftas:Shardul was right that Yuan use in trade has risen, but it’s still only about 4.5% (Q4 2024), far behind the dollar (~50%), euro and yen. BRICS de-dollarisation faces a big hurdle: a common currency would effectively mean the yuan, which India is unlikely to accept.China invests in education and research, but its authoritarian system, closed economy and media, expansionism, and ethnic cleansing in Tibet make it an unreliable partner, especially given its claims over Indian territory. Putin’s aggression in Ukraine stems more from his “Akhand Russia” project than NATO “threats”; Eastern Europeans chose the West, and the war only expanded NATO.The US, despite flaws, isn’t a security threat and remains vital for India in education, tech and trade. Please also consider a show on Japan—and Shardul, do check out Phantom Blade 0.***Mithilesh Nayak (AI Summary)Dear NL Team,Avid Hafta listeners here. We agree on understanding China beyond Indian media caricatures, but ep-553 fell short:-Development concentration/ghost towns discussion relied on anecdotes, not data/reasoning. Real estate investment persists despite crisis—e.g., parents demanding grooms own houses.-Expected deeper takes on Chinese views of Indians: Buddhism, colonial India's role in their \"century of humiliation,\" Indo-Tibetan borders, QUAD—not just four panelist points.-No caste, but Confucianism hierarchy endures: Han-Chinese dominance over sub-ethnic groups, plus gender divides.-China's \"tech edge\" omits IP theft via laws and state-funded overseas education.-Skip SCO leaders' body language (leave to mainstream media); focus on diplomatic/economic strategies.Best,Abhilasha Kamboj and Mithilesh Nayak***Ravinder Singh The youth protests that are happening in Nepal, and last year in Bangladesh. Both are 2 south Asian societies fighting against essentially inequality but in the name of “corruption & nepotism”. In India also inequality, a new term for “the caste system” remains high, probably worse. When will Indian GenZ rise? Do we have any hopes?In reality this is the only model (of violent protests) that can rescue a deeply unequal society. We have seen it in the French Revolution, in the Arab springs, and now we see it closer home. The non violent way allows the rich to escape, taking away the loot with them. What does the NL team think? I am kinda convinced that it’s either violence or sustained inequality which never goes out. ***KaySomewhat tangential but still relevant to Hafta 552, is the complete monopoly that one community has in India's startup space. I have been attempting to build within this space for a couple of years now and it is shocking how little anyone talks about the dominance of Baniya networks in India's so called startup revolution, whether in the founder space, or the venture capitalists themselves. A quick Google search will reveal this startling fact – that the reason why we tend to breed mediocrity, plagiarism, exploitation, and inefficiency within industry, is this complete lack of diversity, and the caste incestuous nature thereof. I wonder if this is something you would like to explore at Newslaundry because it's all well and good to criticise malpractice within Indian tech but if we don't interrogate the root cause reality of the space, the critique remains unidimensional. ***Raghav The discussion on dogs was quite interesting. Abhinandan please note it is not only the slum dwellers that walk on the road. I like to walk home from my workplace or gym. I have been attacked twice in the last one year and in Gurgaon I have learnt to walk with a stick or a brick in hand. I recently bought a hiking stick from Decathlon for the dogs. I like dogs generally but the dog menace in public spaces is real. I was very happy when the SC brought this up. The acknowledgment of the problem is the starting of a solution. Hopefully we will reach a point where the loveable dogs cease to be a nuisance and one has to not think twice about stepping out on the road because of them.***Kishan Rathore This is my first ever feedback, and it comes from prolonged frustration with the Newslaundry app. The podcasts take a long time to load, and if I close and reopen the app, they often never load at all. Since I usually listen while driving, this makes the experience very frustrating. I love your content and opinions, but the app issues make it hard to fully support you. I’m not sure if this is related to my location (US) or something else, but I hope your tech team can look into it.Another issue is with the audio versions of articles. Many of them end abruptly before covering the full story. As I often rely on audio while driving or working, this makes it difficult to follow along.I share this feedback out of genuine appreciation of your work and hope it helps improve the app experience.***Dr AKMy question to the panel is why the government cannot concede on dairy and agriculture? Dairy and agri products transported all the way from the US, produced by expensive US labor, are bound to cost more than Indian alternatives, so why is the government so scared?On Twitter I noticed that some sections are afraid that “meat eating” cow milk will be sold in India. Idk the truth about that, but if that’s the case, the Indian consumer knows which product to buy. I don’t think American dairy and agri products can be competitive in India cos Indians produce that for lower cost.This whole thing seems like the classic imposition of brahminical need for purity by a small minority on a vast meat eating majority.Not an expert on this, but if I’m mistaken, I’d like to be corrected.***Amrinder Singh Hundal Hello NL,I think the primary thing that Modi has done in the last 1 year is ‘irk Trump’. I think Trump wanted Modi to visit him when he was campaigning last year and Modi didn’t meet him. Modi didn’t want to irritate Kamala Harris, who Indian intel thought had a chance to win( I don’t know how). Modi played neutral and Trump being Trump has kept it in his heart this behaviour of Modi, which for Trump must have been like a betrayal. Secondly, Ambani is skimming rich dividends outta Russian oil and who dares to come in the way of his profits. The poor working class? No chance these poor citizens of India have got. They must bear the wrath of the Orange King! So let us all come together and Hail Modi and Hail Ambani too! Our dear Lords!Amrinder Singh Hundal (हुंदल)***Letter 2Dear NL,After the SCO frenzy on legacy media,I’ve seen people of Punjab , especially from rural areas disenfranchised from India on a whole. Punjab’s funds haven't been released since infinity. Punjab gets just a phone call from Modi. 29 people are dead,4 lac acres of crops have been submerged in water. Even NL Charcha mentioned Himachal, UK, Rajasthan etc., but they skipped Punjab. Secondary embankments on Satluj 3 kms from my hometown Ferozpur almost breached, but people of our villages have been working non stop since 31 August to strengthen it. The state of Dam control (under the Union) can be judged from the fact that knowing future rains in Mountains would flood the dams, still they didn’t release water beforehand and waited to reach the upper limit in both Pong and Bhakra Dam (Beas and Satluj). Gates of Madhopur barrage on Ravi in Pathankot broke.***GautamHello NL Team,I've been a long-time subscriber and wanted to share some thoughts. After observing the recent introduction of the three bills by the BJP, it's increasingly evident that the government is running low on fresh ideas. Since 2019, most major legislations have focused more on control than on meaningful, long-term reform. This trend has felt even more hollow post-2024. While certain proposals like tax reduction and changes to waqf laws sparked intellectual debate, many lesser-known bills quietly passed with minimal scrutiny or discussion. It's concerning that Parliament – meant to be a space for robust legislative debate – often sidelines this core responsibility. Instead, legislation seems to be rushed through without adequate transparency or engagement.

As such, Hostin was prone to making profoundly racist comments that either attacked white people, promoted black people above others, and much more. And just like the year prior, Hostin put her toxic heart out there for all to see in 2025.\n\nFrom praising black women as the superior demographic in America to scoffing at a white woman being set on fire to flip flopping on Pope Leo XIV after she learned of his black ancestry, Hostin proved herself to be someone who only viewed America and the rest of the world through a racist prism of hatred.\n\nBelow are the eight of Hostin’s most racist moments of 2025. And she has the nerve to whine about those who call her out, and despite the fact she had slave owner ancestors.\n\nHostin Insists Black Women Are a Superior Demographic, 'Voted to Save' America\n\nHostin routinely bloviated about how her “lived experience” as an “Afro-Latina” gave her the unique perspective to see and speak about how racist America purportedly was. It was that self-righteousness that led to her praising herself for being a black woman, the superior demographic.\n\nAccording to her, black women were superior because they simply voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris:\n\nHOSTIN: And when black people win and get rights like civil right, everybody does better and that's something that the Democrats can take a page out of the book for. But, you know, I'm starting to think as I've said before, I'm one of the 92 percent of black women that voted for Kamala Harris and so I'm sort of in a resting place right now because I voted to save the country and the country didn't vote with me. The majority of the country.\n\nSunny Hostin: America 'Still Is Sickened' With Racism and Slavery\n\nHostin had previously shared that it was her father who taught her to hate America and look at the world through a prism of chronic racial grievance. And every once in a while, she’d go on racially charged rants about how terrible America purportedly was. Like she did in November:\n\nBecause of my lived experience as an afro-Latina, I'm able to look at this world with a different prism and I'm able to tell this country and tell this audience and tell my fellow co-hosts some uncomfortable truths. This is a country based on racism and slavery and founded in it. There is systemic racism. And misogyny\n\nIt was a rant so potent that it spilled over into their Behind the Table podcast, where she claimed America was “still sickened with” racism and slavery.\n\nSunny Hostin Scoffs at Woman Burned to Death By Illegal Immigrant\n\nHostin’s heartlessness was on full display in January during a dust up with co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin over the arson death of white Debrina Kawam by a Hispanic illegal immigrant. She openly decried the attention the case was getting because it put a spotlight on the problem of criminal illegals in America.\n\nWhile defending illegal immigration, Hostin had the nerve to attack America for how it supposedly “lacks empathy” when she didn’t show any for Kawam:\n\nHOSTIN: Can I say something? You know, we keep on talking about criminals and immigrants being criminals, and I just want people understand what the facts are and the stats are; is that undocumented immigrants are much less likely to have committed crimes than American citizens. American citizens commit more crimes than one who is undocumented.\n\nI also want to make the point that an undocumented immigrant is not a criminal because he or she is undocumented. That is a civil offense.\n\nI think this country is a country that lacks empathy unless you have lived it, unless you have a lived experience, and that is very unfortunate.\n\nThe View’s Racists Decry White South Africans, Defend Their Racism\n\nWith President Trump giving special protected status to white South Africans who were fleeing persecution, Hostin found a group of immigrants she refused to defend.\n\nHostin parroted denials of persecution and land appropriation from South Africa’s president and decried Trump not giving similar special status to Haitians:\n\nHOSTIN: And I think something we're not talking about is – enough about is what Donald Trump did on Monday is the Trump administration allowed in 59 white South African refugees into this country, claiming that they were fleeing racial discrimination and land appropriation. So the South African president has been actively, you know, denying at and denying that persecution. (...) The fact that Haitians that are truly refugees, they have been denied protective status!\n\nHOSTIN: And yet, we are welcoming white South Afrikaners.\n\nThe View Celebrates Black History Month By Promoting Discredited 1619 Project\n\nLeave it to Hostin to continue to push a project that had long been debunked and called out as revisionist history wish casting, even by black historians:\n\nHOSTIN: Today, we honor investigative journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones who continues to redefine our national conversations on race.\n\nBorn in Waterloo, Iowa her award-winning career covering race, class, education, and equity all started with a letter to the editor of her local paper at just 11 years old. Joins Jones [sic] The New York Times in 2015 and publish her groundbreaking investigative piece four years later, The 1619 Project. The collection of essays and art backdated the founding of the United States from 1776 to 1619, the year when the first enslaved Africans arrived in Virginia.\n\nAlthough it was met with backlash, the project went on to become a best-selling book, a Hulu docu-series and podcast, and inspired her children's book Born on the Water.\n\nSunny Hostin Suddenly Likes New Pope After Learning Black Ancestry\n\nAfter initially bristling at the election of Pope Leo XIV because of his support for traditional marriage, Hostin - a purported “devout Catholic” - announced that she changed her mind about the pope.\n\nHostin didn’t hide the fact that she changed her mind because she learned that Leo had “Haitian and black roots”:\n\nThere’s one other thing that's very interesting to me because President Trump, as you remember, called Haiti a certain type of country. As it turns out, our new American pope has Haitian and black roots! So, we actually have a black pope! Apparently – It's a chef's kiss for me. (....) So, I’m loving it. I’m really enjoying it.\n\nSunny Hostin Fears Her 'All-White Neighborhood' Will Call Cops on Son\n\nHostin was insufferable on TV, but imagine what it would be like to be her neighbor!\n\nIn October, the multi-millionaire TV host announced that she had recently moved to a new, “all white neighborhood” and was already making embarrassing scenes. According to her, she was so terrified that her white neighbors would call the police on his son that she dragged him down to the police station and scolded them to leave him alone:\n\nAs a mother of black children, I know that black boys are not given the presumption of innocence and the presumption of youth. (…) And so, for me, what was interesting was; I have had to be in the position where I've gone to my local police department because I know my son is going to be training for the Junior Olympics, running around the neighborhood, in an all-white neighborhood, and I have brought him to the police and said he belongs to me, this is my son. Do not harass him, do not stop him.\n\nSunny Hostin Whines About Being Called a ‘Race Baiter’ While Bashing Whites\n\nGiven everything we’ve just gone over, it was all the more ridiculous that Hostin would dare whine about people calling her out as a race baiter. It was somehow even more so that she was whining about it while also bashing white people:\n\nIt's been about white mediocre men that are given opportunities. It's about legacy admissions. It's – You don't, you know, have to be excellent. You have to be average if you're white; if you are black, you must – your average must be excellent in order to compete.\n\nAnd, you know, certainly we get punished for talking about our lived experience, you know, I'm called a race baiter and all of this stuff.\n\nIf it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck....","summary":"In addition to being The View’s in-house legal expert (as a former federal prosecutor), co-host Sunny Hostin was the show’s most vocal social justice warrior and proponent of toxic woke ideology.

Walz with federal prosecution for 'gross incompetence' and accused Rep. Ilhan Omar, who represents thousands of Somalis in the state, of marrying her brother to illegally obtain US citizenship.\n\nWalz claimed the state has 'spent years cracking down on fraud - referring cases to law enforcement, shutting down and auditing high-risk programs.' \n\nOmar, meanwhile, has urged people not to blame the entire Somali community for the actions of a few. \n\nBut the outrage reached fever pitch on Friday after a viral video by journalist Nick Shirley uncovered scores of empty Somali-run daycare centers in receipt of taxpayer funds.\n\nNow, amid concerns over a systemic culture of fraud, lawmakers in Washington are demanding measures be taken to enshrine the sanctity of Minnesota's elections.\n\nOf particular concern is an election law that allows a registered voter to 'vouch' for up to eight people seeking same-day registration without an ID.\n\nMinnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon's website explains the process — which is entirely unique among the United States. \n\n'A registered voter from your precinct can go with you to the polling place to sign an oath confirming your address. This is known as \"vouching.\" A registered voter can vouch for up to eight voters,' it says.\n\nNot only this, but voting forms add that 'employees of a residential facility may vouch for an unlimited number of facility residents.'\n\nSenator Mike Lee of Utah on Sunday called for the Senate to immediately pass his SAVE Act (Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility) that would require proof-of-citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections.\n\nVoting rights activist Scott Presler, whose work Lee cited, warned that Minnesota's vouching system was ripe for exploitation. \n\n'Does this allow for potential fraud and abuse of our elections? Absolutely - especially when you consider that Minnesota has same-day voter registration,' he said.\n\nElon Musk, referring to the vouching system, suggested it was a sinister voting loophole that was 'made for fraud' in a post on X. \n\nMinnesota, like 42 other states, requires a sworn affirmation of citizenship under penalty of perjury for voter registration.\n\nBut while this is not unique to Minnesota, the state rejected just 54 out of 1,372,437 registrations between 2022 and 2024 — a minuscule 0.003 percent rate.\n\nThis is far below the 3.0 percent national average, and significantly lower than similarly sized states such as Alabama which rejected 3,843 registrations (0.3 percent) and Colorado which invalidated 91,871 registrations (2.4 percent). \n\nThe data comes from the 2024 Election Administration and Voting Survey, a biennial report the US Election Assistance Commission published in June 2025 to collect comprehensive data on federal election administration.\n\nThe report, which did not specify the reasons for the rejected registrations, credits Minnesota's mature online system, handling 20.5 percent of applications, for 'greatly reducing' duplicates and invalids.\n\nYet while other states also process large volumes digitally, few match Minnesota's extraordinary near-zero rejection rate, leaving a question mark over whether the system is properly vetting voters.\n\nAccording to a database compiled by the conservative think-tank, the Heritage Foundation, Minnesota has the highest incidence of voter fraud in the country. \n\nIt had 138 cases dating back to 2004 (the highest per capita, ~23.7 per million), far exceeding the number in more populous states such as North Carolina (123 cases, ~11 per million), Illinois (117, ~9.2), and Florida (93, ~3.9).\n\nRecent cases have struck at the heart of Minnesota's Somali community. \n\nMuse Mohamed, a Somali-American volunteer for his brother-in-law, state Senator Omar Fateh, escaped jail in November 2022 after lying to a grand jury about mishandling absentee ballots.\n\nThe then-31-year-old was sentenced to house arrest and two years probation after claiming that he received two ballots directly from voters and hand-delivered them to a voting center during the 2020 primary election.\n\nBut the people who were named on the ballots testified at his trial that they had never met Mohamed. \n\nIn another 2022 conviction, Abdihakim Amin Essa, from Minneapolis, was sentenced to 180 days probation after pleading guilty to four vote fraud counts in the 2018 election.\n\nHe was accused of signing as a witness for 13 people who cast absentee ballots when he legally couldn't because he wasn't a US citizen, and signing with his father's name.\n\nEssa told investigators that he worked for a political campaign, but prosecutors did not specify which candidate. \n\nThese convictions have intensified scrutiny on Minnesota's Somali community, while other cases call into question the state's electoral system more broadly. \n\nIn a shocking prosecution earlier this year, Ronnie Williams, 58, and his girlfriend Lorraine Combs, 57, pleaded guilty to filling out more than 500 phony voter registration forms while living in West St. Paul, outside Minneapolis.\n\nAn unnamed foundation paid Williams to register the voters between 2021 and 2022. Prosecutors haven't named the foundation because the investigation remains active. \n\nState officials, including Secretary of State Simon, insist voter fraud remains 'exceedingly rare.'\n\nCassondra Knudson, a spokeswoman for Simon, hit back at claims that the state's vouching system was easy to exploit.\n\n'Vouching can only be used to provide proof of a potential voter’s residence in the precinct. The potential voter must still provide their Minnesota driver’s license or ID card number or the last four digits of their Social Security number for identity verification,' Knudson said.\n\n'Vouching is most commonly used in senior living facilities by residents who have not updated their driver’s licenses to reflect their current residence. It is also sometimes used in cases where an eligible voter has recently moved to a new address and lacks identification indicating the new address.' \n\nSimon is already battling Pam Bondi's Justice Department over a federal lawsuit demanding broad access to Minnesota voter data.\n\nBondi wants all voter registration records going back at least two years, including partial Social Security numbers and drivers license numbers, arguing the DOJ needs the files to ensure voter lists are correct.\n\nSimon on December 23 moved to dismiss the case, calling it a 'fishing expedition' involving sensitive personal information and arguing Minnesota has taken great pains to balance privacy rights and voter-data access.\n\nThe Trump administration has launched similar lawsuits against 22 states and the District of Columbia following a March executive order alleging widespread voter fraud.","summary":"A shocking undercover video by a citizen journalist has blown the lid off Minnesota's Somali-owned daycares - empty buildings raking in billions in taxpayer funds.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15423241/Minnesota-somali-daycare-ilhan-omar-election-voter-fraud.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/12/31/06/105124555-0-image-a-1_1767161039424.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/12/29/3477422222171391650/1024x576_MP4_3477422222171391650.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-31 07:22:26","author":"Editor,Ross Ibbetson","authors":["Editor","Ross Ibbetson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.39},{"id":390272758,"title":"The Morning Briefing: 2025 Was a Trumptastic Rollercoaster Ride of a Year","text":"Top O' the Briefing\n\nHappy New Year's Eve, dear Kruiser Morning Briefing friends. Telkengraidth felt that his \"Spam Krispies Treats\" would be a hit at the semi-annual Dick Van Patten Trivia Throwdown.\n\nWe will once again be on a modified holiday schedule here at the Briefing. There will be a couple of \"Best Of\" reruns, complete with fresh video greetings from me. Thank you all for indulging me this, I promise it will pay dividends as we get deeper into the new year. \n\nWhat a year this one has been, though. At the end of April I wrote that it felt like President Trump had put 100 months' worth of work into his first 100 days. It was quite the contrast to the \"call a lid by 9 AM\" schedule that Joe Biden had favored for the previous four years. Fueled by Big Macs and Diet Cokes, Trump kept up that relentless work pace all year long.\n\nThere were some truly awful things that happened in 2025, like the frightening fires that ravaged Southern California at the beginning of the year. That was all made more tragic than it needed to be because of the incompetence of the Democrats who are aggressively ruining the Golden State.\n\nThe assassination of Charlie Kirk was beyond jarring. The horror of that was compounded by the soulless reaction of so many on the left, which really made it feel like the deep political divide in this country was only going to get worse. \n\nThere was a lot more, but we don't need to dwell on the negatives today.\n\nUnfortunately, the country had gotten used to lows and misfortune when the desiccated husk of Joe Biden and his commie cabal were running the country. With Trump back in the office, however, there are some highs to go along with the lows. A lot of that has to do with the aforementioned work ethic of his. He handles whatever is thrown his way, all the while staying relentlessly focused in implementing his original agenda. \n\nOne big high has been recent economic news. Just this month, we've heard good things about both inflation and the U.S. economy's growth rate, which we discussed on Christmas Eve. It's a great way to head into a midterm election year. Consistent positive economic news is also something that was a huge departure from the Biden years. Truthful economic news, that is. The Dems' flying monkeys in the mainstream media straight-up lied about Biden's economy for four years. \n\nAnother thing I've greatly enjoyed this year is the ease and humor with which the Trump 47 team pushes back on the adversarial jerks in the mainstream media. After a political lifetime of watching Republican politicians roll over for the media like sad dogs, seeing Trump, Vice President JD Vance, and White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt repeatedly verbally gut-punch MSM hacks is high entertainment indeed.\n\nThe highlight of highlights for the year for me is the tourniquet that President Trump swiftly applied to Biden's porous border. In my latest column I named the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency my \"Person of the Year.\" This kind of border security is something that sane people in border states have wanted for decades. Yes, I'm annoyed that the Democrats are so on the wrong side of everything that I am now counted among the \"sane\" people. \n\nIt's a blessing to have a real president again, one who truly loves the Republic and doesn't want to see it transformed. Let me know in the comments what some of your Trump-induced high points of 2025 were. Now let's rush headlong into this new year and see what kind of fun we can kick up on the other side. \n\nContributions to the Mailbag of Magnificence can be sent to [email protected]\n\nClick the button to get the Morning Briefing emailed to you every weekday.

Share in the comments belowComment Now\n\nClimate doom\n\nUnfortunately, 2025 has been a year of rising temperatures, flash flooding, and unpredictable weather events.\n\nWhile this might seem depressingly normal for us now, it was less common during earlier series of The Simpsons, but as you can imagine, the show has predicted our planet’s demise for a while now.\n\n Lisa’s predictions scared her classmates (Picture: Simpsons)\n\nIn a 2009 episode, The Good, the Sad, and the Drugly, Lisa makes an impassioned speech to her classmates after finding articles online predicting that global warming will leave nothing of their well-loved hometown, Springfield. \n\nYears before schoolgirl Greta Thunberg was shouting about the dangers of climate change, Lisa was leading the way and even diagnosed with Environment-Related Despair – which might now be called climate anxiety.\n\nRecession and financial woes\n\nMarge vs. the Monorail, from 1993, is a tale of economic doom, as the town’s mismanagement of funds results in the investment of a monorail, which fails. \n\nTaking risks with public money, poor decision-making and overspending, leading to widespread chaos and instability, isn’t such a fiction in 2025.\n\nMany countries are experiencing difficult financial challenges, blamed in part on the decisions made by their predecessors, and civilians are feeling the consequences. \n\nDown to the food we eat\n\nWhile plant-based menus are now widely common, back in 1995, the concept of vegetarianism was perplexing for many.\n\n Lisa doesn’t want to eat her usual food after being moved by the animals she saw (Picture: Simpsons)\n\nBut Lisa embraced it in the mid-nineties episode Lisa the Vegetarian. After visiting a petting zoo and becoming attached to a lamb, the 8-year-old refused to eat meat, much to the confusion of her family and friends.\n\nFast-forward to the present day, and the way we consume food has become one of the most talked-about topics in relation to climate change and animal welfare.\n\nCue Lisa proving to be a trailblazer once more.\n\nThe Simpsons is available to watch on Disney+ and Channel 4.\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.","summary":"It's predicted a lot.","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/12/31/every-eerie-prediction-simpsons-got-right-2025-including-global-threat-25316621/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/SEI_277390022-e143.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 06:00:00","author":"Charlotte Minter","authors":["Charlotte Minter"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.184},{"id":390287258,"title":"CBS Boss Has Cringey Response to Being Called Out by George Clooney","text":"Trump-curious CBS News editor-in-chief made a très embarrassing comeback to Trump-furious actor George Clooney’s damning claim that she is ruining the once-prestigious network.\n\nClooney, who played CBS journalist Edward R.

Big fan of your work. It sounds like you’d like to learn more about ours,” Weiss said in a statement to the New York Post on Tuesday.\n\n“This is an open invitation to visit the CBS Broadcast Center, where I’m spending the holidays working to relaunch the Evening News with my colleagues. Tune in January 5.”\n\nIn the Variety cover story, vocal Trump critic Clooney also called out ABC for paying Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over on-air comments made by George Stephanopoulos last December, and the same amount being paid to the president by CBS in July after he criticized the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris less than a month before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe latter lawsuit cleared the way for Paramount, the parent company of CBS, to merge with Skydance.\n\n“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go, f--- yourself, we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney said in the new interview. “That’s simply the truth.” \n\nEarlier this month 60 Minutes pulled a story on the Salvadoran megaprison CECOT three hours before it was due to air. \n\nSharyn Alfonsi, the correspondent who reported the segment, wrote a memo that said she and her producer had asked Weiss for a call to discuss her decision to “spike” the story, but that Weiss “did not afford us that courtesy/opportunity.”\n\n“If the administration’s refusal to participate becomes a valid reason to spike a story, we have effectively handed them a ‘kill switch’ for any reporting they find inconvenient,“ Alfonsi said in the memo, which was leaked online.\n\nClooney, who said he was once friendly with Trump, admitted it was “a very trying time” under the 79-year-old’s leadership.\n\n“It can depress you or make you very angry. But you have to find the most positive way through it. You have to put your head down and keep moving forward because quitting isn’t an option,” said the two-time Oscar winner.\n\nThe Clooneys have been living in southern France since 2021 in order to raise their children outside of the Hollywood spotlight. “Here, they don’t take photos of kids,” Clooney told RTL Radio of life in France. “There aren’t any paparazzi hidden at the school gates.

While Carlson earned his award by demonizing the Jewish state, Trump will be honored with the “Israel Award” for his steadfast defense of Israel and its people. Trump learned he was the recipient of Israel’s highest honor during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s visit to Mar-a-Lago this week, in a phone call with Education Minister Yoav Kisch. The Times of Israel reports:\n\nKisch thanked Trump for his “significant and consistent efforts on behalf of the Jewish people in the State of Israel,” citing among his “many contributions” his fight against antisemitism; efforts to return the hostages from Gaza; recognition of Israeli sovereignty in the Golan Heights; moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and “unwavering support for Israel’s right to defend itself, including during a period in which Israel confronted seven active fronts.”\n\n Related: No Nobel, No Problem: Israel Honors Trump for Real-World Peace\n\nTrump not only supported Israel’s right to defend itself but also recognized that Iran’s nuclear program posed a threat not just to Israel, but to the United States as well — and acted to eliminate that threat. Carlson had incorrectly predicted that such action would trigger World War III. Before approving U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites, Trump dismissed Carlson as “kooky,” arguing that a genocidal regime cannot be allowed to possess nuclear weapons with which to threaten the free world.\n\n Netanyahu called Trump Israel’s greatest friend ever in the White House, and Trump’s remarks at this year’s White House Hanukkah party reminded the world how fortunate Jews are that Kamala Harris is not residing there. “I will always be a friend and a champion to the Jewish people,” he said in a speech that warned of the rising level of antisemitism in Congress. Unlike Carlson, who says radical Islam isn't an existential threat, Trump said he’d be resolute in the fight against jihad: “All nations must stand together against the evil forces of radical Islamic terrorism, and we’re doing that.”\n\nCarlson may criticize Trump in private text messages, but Ben Shapiro is correct — he’d never call him out by name in public, “because Tucker is a coward when it comes to President Trump.” British author Douglas Murray, on the other hand, is no coward and openly called Carlson out at this year's Global Conference for Israel:\n\nNothing is more delegitimizing for the conservative side than to have people who claim to be on the conservative side playing footsie with Nazis, antisemites, and racists. Nothing can be more destructive for our side than people like Tucker Carlson, who give the most virulent, hard-edged attack interview they possibly can to Senator Ted Cruz.\n\nCarlson, of course, now reserves his softball interviews for Hitler admirers like Nick Fuentes.\n\nMurray was called “one of the most steadfast and eloquent non-Jewish defenders of the Jewish people and the state of Israel” at the conference and asked to explain why he loved Israel so deeply:\n\nThere’s something said about the need to ask the question, by which I mean when Jewish friends and Israeli friends and others say, “But I don’t understand, like how come you’re on our side?” I said, “Who wouldn’t be? Who wouldn’t be?” And I think that’s a much healthier way to think of it. … I’ve never found it difficult. I mean, in a fight between a democracy and a death cult, between a society that loves life and a society that worships death, I don’t find it hard to choose.\n\nMurray presciently warned about the decline of Europe in his 2017 book The Strange Death of Europe: Immigration, Identity, Islam. His latest book delivers a warning to all of Western civilization: On Democracies and Death Cults: Israel and the Future of Civilization. Will enough people listen?\n\nAs Carlson has descended further into this anti-Israel madness, he’s directed a lot of his venom at Christian Zionism, calling it a “heresy” and a “brain virus” in his infamous interview with Fuentes. Some of the people he said were infected by this virus were Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and U.S. Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee, whose clear defenses of Israel, when contrasted with Carlson’s conspiracy theories, show who really is suffering from a brain virus. Also proving that there are not only biblical reasons for supporting Israel, the next person on my list, Victor Davis Hanson, begins his explanation of an “overlooked reason” to support Israel with an admission: “I must come clean. I am not a Christian Zionist. I support Israel for one reason: It is in the interest of my country, the United States.” He continues:\n\nIsrael is a consensual government. It’s surrounded by 500 million people of the Islamic world—Shia and Sunni, Iranian and Arab—that aren’t; they’re not consensual. There’s only one government that is truly a free, democratic government, and that’s Israel. So it has affinities with the United States and interest with the United States that transcends anything to do with the 7 million Americans who are Jewish Americans. That’s just a given. They are not directing American policy. They couldn’t unless Israel was democratic, consensual, Western, and an outpost in a dangerous part of the world that has key resources for global prosperity with oil and, more importantly, is an enemy of our existential enemy that transcends any question of Israeli or Iranian animosity, and that’s the theocratic government of Iran that began its existence by taking Americans hostage and storming our embassy.\n\nThis week, we learned that VDH is undergoing a major operation for a serious health issue. He wrote that all he can do is “trust in the power of prayer and faith.” Surely, Jews are among the many thousands keeping him in their prayers.\n\nIn a powerful Christmas Eve message on his radio show, Hugh Hewitt, who is Catholic, reminded listeners that it's not just Iran that Israel helps us against:\n\nIsrael is objectively the most important in the United States in a world of free countries opposed by the alliance of tyrants led by Xi, Putin, Kim Jong-un, Khamenei, Maduro, the gang running Cuba. They’re a bunch of tyrants around the world. And they’re not our friends and Israel is. It’s a nuclear superpower. It’s an intelligence superpower. It has the will and ability to project power along with us as we did in Operation Midnight Hammer — thank you, President Trump — this summer.\n\nIn an earlier article titled \"From Kristallnacht to Today: Why Jews Fear History Repeating,\" I shared Hewitt's warning about the rising tide of antisemitism in the West, but it's worth citing here: \n\nMein Kampf came out 101 years ago, in 1925. That’s Hitler’s call to arms against the Jews. He takes another eight years to get to power in Germany. After he’s in power in 1933, it takes five years to Kristallnacht. That’s when the real pogrom came to Germany. Germany was as civilized as the United States was. All right. Just as civilized. And then after Kristallnacht, 1938, takes another three years till the killing operations, the Holocaust actually goes into killing mode. I believe at Chelmno in December of 1941. And I think the same cycle is repeating itself. Antisemitism is the evil of the day right now.\n\nI began this piece with Trump; I’ll end it with a political figure from the other party, Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania. He’s stood out for calling out his increasingly anti-Israel party’s stance on Palestinian statehood, supporting the possibility of future strikes against Iran to prevent it from obtaining nuclear weapons, and displaying posters of every Hamas hostage in his office. He was asked this year what it’s like when his sense of what is right goes against his party and his base:\n\nIt’s always been a very easy choice to proudly, unapologetically stand with Israel and the Jewish community. There’s always been, for me, a moral clarity. … After 10/7, you really got to pick a side. Israel is the kind of place, and our key ally, that has, and defends, and projects the kind of values that we want to have and we would want to have for everybody. ... After 10/7, it’s very clear. I said that I hope it’s not true, but I’m happy to remain the last man standing—to be standing with Israel through this.\n\nIt's heartening to know that there are so many other individuals I could add to this list of non-Jewish defenders of Israel and Jews. Argentina President Javier Milei, Carl M. Cannon of RealClearPolitics, and Australian journalist Erin Molan are just a few.

Welfare cheats like it because they get rich. But it’s a zero-sum game, and they’re stealing both money and political power from Minnesotans.”\n\nREAD | ‘Hell to pay’: Trump warns Hamas to disarm, Iran to abandon nuclear and missile programmes\n\nRepublican elected officials and federal prosecutors accuse local Democratic authorities of turning a blind eye to numerous warnings because the fraud involved Minnesota’s Somali community, the largest in the country, with around 80 000 members.\n\n“When whistleblowers raised concerns, they were told that they shouldn’t say anything out of fear of being called racist or Islamophobic, or because it was going to hurt political constituency of the governor and the ruling party, the Democrats here,” state representative Kristin Robbins, a Republican who is running for governor, told AFP.\n\nDemocratic Governor Tim Walz - former vice president Kamala Harris’s unsuccessful running mate in 2024 - rejects the accusation.\n\nWhile the case became public in 2022, prosecutors ramped it up again this year with hotly politicised revelations.\n\nAnother Republican candidate for governor, state house speaker Lisa Demuth, told AFP the case is “finally getting the attention that it’s needed”.\n\nRight-leaning YouTube content creator Nick Shirley reignited interest in the case over the holidays with a video that he claims shows daycare centres which are siphoning public money.\n\nThe video - which blew up on X with 127 million views and played repeatedly on Fox News - resonated with Trump’s “Make America Great Again” (MAGA) circles, who are opposed to what they deem to be overly generous social and immigration policies.\n\nThe Trump administration responded to the outcry immediately, with Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin telling Fox News that hundreds of investigators were targeting local businesses in Minneapolis. \n\n“We believe that there is rampant fraud, whether it be daycare centres, health care centres, or other organisations,” she said.\n\nAs part of the crackdown, federal health officials announced a broad freeze of funding to Minnesota and across the county. \n\n“We have frozen all child care payments to the state of Minnesota,” Health and Human Services (HHS) deputy Jim O’Neill wrote in an X post on Tuesday.\n\nHHS has broad spending oversight for programmes for the underprivileged, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, early education of toddlers and foster care.\n\nMinnesota congressman Tom Emmer, a leading figure in the Republican majority of Congress, called for mass “denaturalisation and deportation of every Somali engaged in fraud in Minnesota”, in an X post on Monday.\n\nUS President Donald Trump preceded Emmer’s call with similar sentiments at the end of November, when a conservative outlet claimed money embezzled in Minnesota was being used to fund Somalia’s Al-Shabaab, an Al-Qaeda linked Islamist militant group.\n\nThat accusation has since been denied by the prosecutor in the case.\n\nBut the US president was quick to accuse “Somali gangs” of “terrorising” Minnesotans and ended their Temporary Protected Status, a programme that exempted Somalis from deportation to their war-torn country.\n\nA week later, Trump escalated the rhetoric, saying Somalia “stinks” and calling Democratic congresswoman Ilhan Omar - who is of Somali origin - “trash”.\n\nA surge in immigration raids followed those comments, creating “a dangerous atmosphere of chaos and instability that is making it harder for our police officers to keep Minneapolis safe”, mayor Jacob Frey said at the time.\n\nDemocratic lawmaker Zaynab Mohamed, whose family emigrated from Somalia when she was a child, decried the Trump administration’s actions.\n\n“Trump is scapegoating a tiny piece of the population,” she said. \n\n“This is not about crime. It’s not about safety. This is about purging people like me from this country.”","url":"https://www.news24.com/world/trump-administration-targets-somali-community-after-minnesota-fraud-revelations-20251231-0258","image":"https://news24cobalt.24.co.za/resources/02a0-1f913052ac0f-3e20a5a11f47-1000/format/inline/pam_bondi.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 04:20:12","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"za","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":390223124,"title":"Bari Weiss' Response to Clooney's Attack - C’est Magnifique","text":"Since taking the helm at CBS News, Editor-in-Chief Bari Weiss has shown no fear, and her response to Hollywood leftist darling George Clooney's attack on her is truly...magnifique.\n\nIt all started after the 64-year-old actor took a swipe at Weiss' leadership, of course, using broad claims, lacking any detail, about Weiss.

After Paramount settled, the Trump administration approved the company's proposed merger with media giant Skydance. \n\nCBS' new owners then installed conservative columnist Bari Weiss as the new editor-in-","url":"https://www.alternet.org/george-clooney-trump-cbs/","image":"https://www.alternet.org/media-library/image.png?id=62647684&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 01:59:11","author":"Carl Gibson","authors":["Carl Gibson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":390263754,"title":"George Clooney Accuses Bari Weiss of 'Dismantling CBS News,' Rages at Trump","text":"Actor George Clooney, who fled the United States for France and officially arranged for his children to become French citizens, is accusing CBS News chief Bari Weiss of “dismantling” the network’s news division.\n\n“Bari Weiss is dismantling CBS News as we speak,” Clooney bloviated in an interview with Variety. “Am I worried about film studios? Sure. It’s my business, but my primary loyalty is to my country. I’m much more worried about how we inform ourselves and how we’re going to discern reality without a functioning press.”\n\nClooney’s calumny comes after Weiss pulled a biased 60 Minutes report last week after producers ignored her requirements that the report consist of more balanced coverage.\n\nThe actor, who has made his home in France, offered no real evidence that Weiss is “dismantling” CBS News, but instead spouted vague concerns over the recent merger between Skydance Media and Paramount, which owns CBS, and Trump’s threatened lawsuit against CBS for materially altering an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris in order to help Harris beat Trump in the 2024 presidential election.\n\n“If CBS and ABC had challenged those lawsuits and said, ‘Go, fuck yourself, we wouldn’t be where we are in the country,” Clooney exclaimed. “That’s simply the truth.”\n\nCBS and Paramount settled the Trump lawsuit in July reportedly for a $16 million payout.\n\n“It’s a very trying time,” Clooney added. “It can depress you or make you very angry. But you have to find the most positive way through it. You have to put your head down and keep moving forward because quitting isn’t an option.”\n\nLike many another Hollywood actor who is woefully out of touch with Americans, Clooney attacked Trump for the cost of living.\n\n“Just straight up, it’s the economy stupid,” Clooney exclaimed. “It’s more expensive now than it was when Joe Biden left office. And powerful people tend to overplay their hands. I think that cruelty, like separating children from their parents, although popular with small groups of people, doesn’t play well with most Americans.”\n\nThe “stupid” may be with Clooney, though, with costs of necessities falling in most cases for average Americans who are not living in multimillion-dollar French villas. Gasoline is now almost half the price when Biden was in office, food is cheaper, rent is down slightly, travel is less costly, wages are up, jobs for Americans are up, and inflation is down below Biden’s bad old days. And growth is up to 4.3 percent, far higher the Biden’s dismal 2.3 percent growth rate in 2024. All this has occurred since Trump took office for his second bifurcated term.\n\nClooney then disgorged another Hollywoodism saying that Trump’s “popularity is very low and it’s not going to be shooting back up.” This is also not true. Trump’s approval rating has at the least remained steady and sometimes has even gone up.\n\nThe Ocean’s 8 star also spoke about the continued contraction of Hollywood as more studios get bought up by fewer and fewer conglomerates.\n\n“I liked having separate studios, and I liked them for what they were each good at, and that kind of specialization has gone away,” he said. “I worry about things all getting rolled up into one giant company. That would be a very sad moment. Sometimes a big company buys all these little players, and they all lose their identity.”\n\nFollow Warner Todd Huston on Facebook at: Facebook.com/Warner.Todd.Huston, Truth Social @WarnerToddHuston, or at X/Twitter @WTHuston","summary":"Actor George Clooney, who fled the United States for France and officially arranged for his children to become French citizens, is accusing CBS News chief Bari Weiss of \"dismantling\" the network's news division.\n\n\nThe post George Clooney Accuses Bari Weiss of &#8216;Dismantling CBS News,&#8217; Rages at Trump appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2025/12/30/george-clooney-accuses-bari-weiss-of-dismantling-cbs-news-rages-at-trump/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/12/clooney-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-31 00:32:15","author":"Warner Todd Huston","authors":["Warner Todd Huston"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.032},{"id":390205588,"title":"Kellyanne Conway shades her ex-husband in a strange rant about Trump foe","text":"President Donald Trump's ex-campaign manager shaded her ex-husband on Fox News on Tuesday during a strange rant about a Hollywood star who's in a spat with the president. \n\nKellyanne Conway ranted about former President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris during an appearance on Fox News' show \"The Five\" on Tuesday.

Tim Walz, D., has consistently ignored signs of the massive, alleged fraud putting Minnesota in the national spotlight. From daycares to nonprofits, immigrant communities in Minnesota have faced multiple accusations of fraud in recent weeks, where they allegedly used state policies to take what some estimate to be about $9 billion in taxpayer dollars. While Walz and his office have touted his work to address these scandals, state lawmakers argue that he has had years to do so and deliberately ignored whistleblowers. Robbins, the chair of Minnesota’s Fraud Prevention and State Agency Oversight Policy Committee, was one of many lawmakers who called on Walz to resign amid his latest run for reelection. She spoke about this during her Monday appearance on \"The Will Cain Show.\" Fox News guest host Lawrence Jones noted to the lawmaker, \"It’s one thing to call on him to resign. He’s clearly not going to do that. But if he doesn’t, shouldn’t you guys just impeach him just based on not just the fraud and corruption here, but going after those whistleblowers who sounded the alarm?\" LOEFFLER: VAST NETWORK OF SOMALI NONPROFITS RIPPED OFF MINNESOTA’S WELFARE STATE \"Absolutely. I called for the governor to resign several weeks ago. I just think his dereliction of duty is unconscionable,\" Robbins, who is running for governor, said. \"These whistle-blowers have been sounding the alarm for years,\" she continued. \"We’ve had hearing for almost a year now holding his agencies accountable. He’s not fired anyone. He’s not taken steps to stop the fraud on the front end, and he continues to make excuses. So I would absolutely want him to resign as I said weeks ago, or I know others are looking at articles of impeachment. But he is responsible. He’s turned a blind eye for seven years, and we need to clean house in the executive branch.\" Jones noted that Walz would have become Vice President of the United States if former Vice President Kamala Harris had won, asking Robbins what she thinks that outcome would have looked like. \"Oh, it would be terrible. I’m so grateful that President Trump led the DOGE effort to clean up the federal government, and we need to continue to work to clean up the state government here in Minnesota,\" she replied. \"And I’ve heard from other places around the country, they’re dealing with not the scale of fraud we have, but similar fraud. So we have to get a handle on this. These are taxpayer dollars that have been stolen from our taxpayers and that should be helping vulnerable citizens, not fake students, not fake recipients and getting sent overseas.\" Lawrence noted his wonder that even as this scandal enters the national public discourse, the fraud appears to continue, asking whether people will actually face consequences. BROADCAST BIAS: NETWORKS BLAST TRUMP ‘TIRADE’ BUT NOT $1B SOMALI SCAM ROCKING MINNESOTA Robbins agreed, noting her shock that payments are still being sent out, \"This just shows their complete lack of due diligence and internal controls. So we need to clean it up. We need to stop it and everyone should get prosecuted. I know the U.S. attorney here is doing a phenomenal job. We are grateful additional resources are being put in the state by the federal government, but everyone should get prosecuted, from the governor to every criminal that has stolen taxpayer money.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Gov. Walz’s office, they sent an article from the Minnesota Star Tribune headlined, \"GOP governor candidate faces criticism for withholding fraud whistleblower tips from DHS.\" The article states Robbins faced criticism from Democrats for taking info about the fraud to the federal U.S. Attorney’s Office rather than local state authorities. Robbins is one of multiple lawmakers who claimed that the local state government has retaliated against whistleblowers. Walz’s office also shared a link to Minnesota Governor candidate Scott Jensen, who argued in a post that Robbins’ fraud committee \"has not advanced one substantive bill to prevent fraud and according to several members of the committee, its main focus has been political grandstanding.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Jensen did praise independent journalist Nick Shirley’s video investigation exposing allegedly fraudulent businesses, however, saying, \"Over the last 48 hours, Nick Shirley’s X Post regarding MN fraud has had 100 million views.

With a favorable map, a three-seat majority, and Vice President JD Vance as the tie-breaker, Democrats would need to net four seats to flip the chamber—an undeniably steep climb.\n\nThe challenge is obvious: Democrats must defend an open seat in Michigan and a toss-up seat in Georgia while also trying to unseat at least three Republicans, which would require wins in states President Donald Trump carried in 2024. \n\nYet, oddly enough, the mood in Democratic circles is optimistic. Party strategists point to a strong recruiting class, recent statewide wins, and the possibility that the political environment could shift further in their favor.\n\nTime isn’t exactly on anyone’s side. The 2026 general election may feel distant, but the fight for Senate control is less than a year away. With that in mind, here’s a rundown of the races that we think will define the battle for the majority.\n\nGeorgia (D)\n\nGeorgia Sen. Jon Ossoff remains Democrats’ most endangered incumbent, and Republicans are gearing up to pour tens of millions into defeating him.\n\nBut the GOP’s path got messier the moment Gov. Brian Kemp decided not to run, leaving a vacuum that quickly filled with Reps. Buddy Carter and Mike Collins, along with former University of Tennessee football coach Derek Dooley.\n\nAnd Kemp has only complicated things since then, throwing his weight behind Dooley instead of either lawmaker—and triggering what’s expected to be a volatile primary.\n\n“Primaries tend to get competitive,” Senate Majority Leader John Thune said in November, regarding the brewing intraparty fight. “But we still think in Georgia, once the dust settles there and the smoke clears, that that’s gonna be a really good opportunity for us.”\n\nOssoff, meanwhile, is sitting on a formidable war chest and charting his own path. He voted against the deal to reopen the government, a move that suggests he’s betting on keeping progressive voters firmly in his corner heading into what’s likely to be one of the most expensive races of the cycle.\n\nFew primaries have exploded as quickly as the emerging Democratic fight in Maine, where the party is aiming to unseat Republican Sen. Susan Collins.\n\nGov. Janet Mills entered the race in October, after months of behind-the-scenes recruiting by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But her path to the nomination isn’t guaranteed. Graham Platner, an oyster farmer and military veteran backed by progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, has stormed the contest, quickly capturing attention and momentum.\n\nThe question now is whether Platner’s surge can last—or if it will fizzle under scrutiny. His campaign has faced blowback over a tattoo he had resembling a Nazi symbol, which he has since had covered up, as well as a series of offensive posts on Reddit.\n\nWhile that may leave Mills as the steadier option for Democrats, she comes with her own complications. She is 77 years old and running for a six-year term at a time when many in the party are calling for generational change.\n\nStill, Maine’s political landscape offers Democrats reason for cautious optimism. Collins’ approval ratings have slipped since her previous reelection, and the state favored former Vice President Kamala Harris by about 7 percentage points in 2024.\n\nEven so, Collins remains a formidable incumbent, making this a challenging—and closely watched—race for Democrats in 2026.\n\nNorth Carolina (Open R)\n\nRepublicans are bracing to defend an open Senate seat in North Carolina after Sen. Thom Tillis announced his retirement in June, citing clashes with Trump over the president’s tax and spending law. And Tillis’ exit has given Democrats a real opening.\n\nInto that breach steps former Gov. Roy Cooper, Democrats’ top recruit for 2026. Cooper formally launched his campaign in July, and his statewide track record is impeccable, winning all six of the previous statewide contests he’s run in. And so far, polls acknowledge that Cooper, with his far higher name recognition, is the early favorite.\n\nOn the Republican side, former Republican National Committee Chair Michael Whatley has entered the fray. Endorsed by Trump, Whatley is unlikely to face a costly primary, though he may face other obstacles. He is not as well-known as Cooper, and he lacks a distinctive political brand, which could easily hamper his candidacy in a year not expected to favor Republicans.\n\nThat said, the Tar Heel State remains competitive. Trump carried it in all three of the most recent presidential elections. But with Tillis gone and Cooper in the race, the GOP’s grip on the seat is showing early signs of slipping.\n\nNew Hampshire (Open D)\n\nDemocrats face a key defensive battle after three-term Sen. Jeanne Shaheen announced in March that she would retire. The seat opens the door to a familiar lineup of candidates in a state that has leaned Democratic in recent presidential cycles.\n\nIn a quirky twist, the GOP primary pits two former senators against each other: John E. Sununu, who lost this seat to Shaheen in 2008, and Scott Brown, who previously served in Massachusetts. \n\nSununu has consolidated support within the party, reflecting the broader effort to coalesce around a single candidate. A November poll from the University of New Hampshire Survey Center suggests he is the GOP’s strongest option for the general election.\n\nStill, challenges remain. A Republican presidential candidate has not won the state since the 2000 election. And whoever wins the Republican primary will likely face Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas, a candidate with deep family roots in the state and a record of winning tough races. Polls currently show Pappas holding a slight edge against Sununu and a large one against Brown. If elected, Pappas would become the first out gay man in the Senate.\n\nHowever, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte, who is popular, will also be up for reelection in 2026, which could complicate Democrats’ path to victory. \n\nIn an open race, anything is possible.\n\nIn Ohio, Democrats have secured the recruit they wanted most: former Sen. Sherrod Brown.\n\nFirst elected in 2006, Brown survived two grueling reelection fights even as Ohio drifted rightward at the presidential level. In 2018, he beat GOP Rep. Jim Renacci by nearly 7 points in a state that Trump had carried two years earlier and would carry again two years later. But Brown’s run ended last cycle, when he lost to now-Sen. Bernie Moreno.\n\nBrown is attempting a comeback against Sen. Jon Husted, whom Republican Gov. Mike DeWine appointed to fill Vance’s seat after he became vice president. Both Brown and Husted are cruising through their primaries, setting up what is sure to be an expensive showdown in the general election.\n\nHusted, armed with Trump’s endorsement, hauled in $3.7 million in the third quarter of 2025—“the highest amount ever raised by a Republican candidate at this stage of a U.S. Senate race in Ohio,” his team boasted. But Brown’s fundraising dwarfed it: He pulled in a massive $8 million in just six weeks.\n\nWhoever wins in 2026 will serve only the remaining two years of Vance’s term and will also have to face voters in 2028 for a full six-year term.\n\nMichigan (Open D)\n\nMichigan is once again shaping up as a major battleground. The state narrowly backed Trump in 2024, and its Senate seat is now open after Democratic Sen. Gary Peters announced he would not run again.\n\nDemocrats are bracing for a competitive primary that spans the party’s ideological range. Four-term Rep. Haley Stevens is seen as the establishment favorite, while state Sen. Mallory McMorrow and progressive organizer Abdul El-Sayed are pitching themselves as candidates who can break out of that mold.\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have consolidated support early. Trump has endorsed former Rep. Mike Rogers for his second Senate run, after losing a razor-thin race to Democratic Sen. Elissa Slotkin in 2024. Rogers, an Army veteran, is pro-tariff and doesn’t want the government negotiating drug prices to make them cheaper.\n\nHowever, despite Trump winning Michigan twice, that success hasn’t translated downballot. Michigan has been a Senate mirage for the GOP, which hasn’t won a seat there in more than three decades.\n\nFor now, Michigan is one of the true toss-ups on the map—an open question in a state that rarely makes anything easy.","summary":"The 2026 Senate midterms should be Republicans’ to lose.

Here are 14 things worth celebrating, in no particular order except for the first entry.\n\nChristmas is still a big deal. The birth of Jesus and His message of redemption and eternal life have inspired billions of people all over the world. People in the United States – even non-Christians – seemed this time around to feel freer to express seasonal joy and to wish each other a “Merry Christmas” without fear of offense.\n\nThe White House is doing great things. President Donald Trump has been reversing literally hundreds of bad policies put in place by his predecessor and appointing judges who respect the Constitution.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is nowhere near the Oval Office. Had she won, she would have been a leftist Grinch, wreaking havoc on hardworking citizens. Makes one shudder to think about it. Brrrrr.\n\nThe transgender overreach is getting major pushback. In Europe and America, people are waking to the reality that subjecting sexually confused kids to dangerous drugs, hormones and surgeries is child abuse at its worst. This should still be a major issue for Republicans because Democrats support the madness in every way, including allowing biological males to compete in girls’ sports. Make them own it.\n\nAmerica’s border is secure. From literally millions of illegal aliens crossing each year under the Biden administration, the torrent has slowed to a trickle. The Border Patrol reported zero “catch-and-releases” into the U.S. for at least nine consecutive months.\n\nPresident Trump took out Iran’s nuclear facilities. Instead of shipping pallets of $1.7 billion in cash to the mullahs, as occurred under Barack Obama, the United States bombed factories that were working to produce nuclear bombs for the world’s most dangerous terrorist regime.\n\nMilitary recruitment is way up. The Pentagon reports the best performance in 15 years, with all active-duty branches meeting or exceeding goals, as Secretary of War Pete Hegseth restores the “warrior” culture.\n\nA tragedy with a silver lining. After Turning Point USA’s Charlie Kirk was killed on a Utah college campus on Sept. 10, Turning Point USA has experienced explosive growth. Kirk’s widow, Erika Kirk, has impressed the world with her poise, courage and determination.\n\nAt TPUSA’s AmericaFest 2025 in Phoenix, she said, “More than 140,000 people have submitted requests to join … bringing the membership to over 1 million people across 4,000 chapters.” Even superstar rapper Nicki Minaj has come out as a closet conservative.\n\nYoung people are going back to church. In what it describes as a “historic reversal,” the Barna Group reports that young adults are now the most regular attendees among churched Christians. These include Gen Z and Millennials. Further, the decline in overall church attendance, which began stabilizing in 2020, shows no sign of diving again, with a possible revival underway.\n\nThe Supreme Court slapped down Planned Parenthood. In June, the court rejected its claim that South Carolina must fund it with tax dollars. Along those lines, the federal “Big, Beautiful” budget bill defunded the abortion giant for at least a year.\n\nThe stock market continues to roar and the economy is showing vibrant growth. Inflation has been curbed, and the Gross Domestic Product grew by 4.3 percent in the third quarter, exceeding forecasts.\n\nGasoline prices have plummeted. Thanks to President Trump’s renewed emphasis on America’s energy production, a gallon costs less than $3 in most places except, of course, California. This will ripple through the economy. The jury is out on his tariffs, but they have brought in an estimated $200 billion to the U.S. Treasury and inspired billions in new corporate investments in the U.S.\n\nVenezuela is reeling. The socialist South American dictatorship may crash and take Havana’s with it. This would free two nations from totalitarian rule. The Wall Street Journal reported that President Trump’s seizing of oil tankers is strangling already impoverished communist Cuba.\n\nAt the least, Cuba’s leaders are less able to sow revolution in South and Central America. At best, both tyrannical governments will be overthrown, democratic republics will emerge, and millions who fled will get to return to their countries.\n\nShohei Ohtani of the Dodgers relit the spirit of Babe Ruth. The impossibly good slugger/pitcher on the Dodgers is doing things not seen since the 1920s. Despite some lingering nods to wokeness, Major League Baseball is doing well. Total attendance was 71,409,421 fans, the third consecutive year exceeding 70 million. Credit goes to star power and the pitch clock, which makes games more watchable.\n\nFinally, here’s a 15th reason to celebrate. For mental health reasons, radio stations and stores agreed to limit the number of times Mariah Carey’s “All I want for Christmas Is You” was played.\n\nJust kidding. I heard it over and over, but for some reason, it didn’t bother me.\n\nHappy New Year!\n\nThis column was first published at the Washington Times.","summary":"'Even superstar rapper Nicki Minaj has come out as a closet conservative'","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/12/14-good-things-that-happened-2025/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/donald-trump-20251117-jpg.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-30 23:48:10","author":"Robert Knight","authors":["Robert Knight"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.119},{"id":390212968,"title":"Here are the Bay Area's most-searched trends on Google in 2025","text":"(KRON) -- There are many ways to sum up 2025.
