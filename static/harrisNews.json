The president was initially seeking $20 billion in the suit.\n\nParamount’s controlling owner Shari Redstone will reportedly receive a nearly $2 billion payout if the merger between the media conglomerate and Skydance goes through.\n\nThere has already been plenty of unrest at the company over Trump’s lawsuit.\n\n“60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens abruptly quit in April — citing a loss of journalistic independence. \n\nShortly after, CBS News president and CEO Wendy McMahon — a close Owens ally — announced in May that she’d step down, telling staffers in a memo, “It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward. It’s time for me to move on and for this organization to move forward with new leadership.”\n\nA Paramount rep told Page Six in a statement: “Contrary to some news reports or media speculation, Paramount’s settlement with President Trump does not include PSAs or anything related to PSAs. Paramount has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties. The material terms of the settlement agreement in principle are those disclosed by us yesterday.”\n\nSkydance Media did not return a request for comment.","summary":"A source tells us that \"Paramount had absolutely nothing to do with this side deal\" and it was not what the \"Paramount board approved.\"","url":"https://pagesix.com/2025/07/02/entertainment/paramount-insider-shock-over-reported-side-deal-with-trump/","image":"https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/107514053.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 23:30:47","author":"Mara Siegler,mliss1578","authors":["Mara Siegler","mliss1578"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.301},{"id":337646132,"title":"How secret ‘side deal’ helped seal Paramount’s $16M settlement with Trump — and here’s who deserves the credit","text":"Shari Redstone’s Paramount received an unusual assist to settle its controversial lawsuit with President Trump, which should now clear the way for its long-awaited sale to independent studio Skydance, On The Money has learned.Skydance boss David Ellison, the son of Trump friend and billionaire Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, stepped up and agreed that once he takes control of the Tiffany Network, currently part of Redstone’s flailing media empire, it will run between $15 million and $20 million of public service ads to promote causes supported by the president, a source with knowledge of the negotiations said.\n\n“There is an anticipation of a mid-eight-figure sum that will be allocated by the network to PSA advertisements and other broadcast transmissions that support conservative causes supported by President Trump,” the source said.\n\nWith the inclusion of the PSAs, the total settlement would amount to more than $30 million. Thanks to its unusual structure with the additional money supplied by Ellison and not current management, the Paramount board and Redstone can sidestep one of their main roadblocks to settling the lawsuit: Fear of bribery charges. \n\nParamount denied any knowledge of a “side deal.”\n\n“Paramount knows nothing about the alleged side deal between Trump\\Ellison, had absolutely nothing to do with it, nor was it a part of what the board approved, and the mediator sanctioned.” a spokesperson told On The Money.A Skydance spokeswoman had no comment on the matter.\n\nLate Tuesday, current management agreed to pay $16 million to settle the Trump suit claiming the president’s 2024 presidential campaign was damaged by biased editing of a “60 Minutes” interview with his Democratic challenger Kamala Harris. \n\nAs On The Money reported last week, the younger Ellison was bragging that a settlement was in the cards, allowing him to take over Paramount this summer.\n\nThe bribery issues arose because Redstone is in desperate need of cash since inheriting the Paramount media empire from her late father, the media mogul Sumner Redstone and the settlement of the lawsuit is inextricably tied to the deal getting completed since Trump’s regulators must approve the merger.\n\nSince Redstone would receive around $2 billion once the deal is done, any sizable payment could be seen as a bribe to get the Federal Communications Commission’s green light.Now, any bribery charges become nearly impossible to prove because Paramount is not party to any side deal between Ellison and Trump. In fact, Ellison isn’t party to the suit in any way. Rather there is just an “expectation” that he will make good on his promise for the PSAs, people close to the deal say.\n\nTrump administration officials have denied that there was a quid pro quo between the lawsuit and FCC approval. \n\nWhile the agency opened an investigation into CBS over the same issues, namely that the “60 Minutes” violated the FCC’s public interest rules demanding unbiased new programming over public airwaves, as opposed to cable, Trump officials say the inquiry was prompted by a separate complaint filed with regulators.\n\nCord cutting and other industry changes has decimated Paramount’s bottom line, and Redstone’s once formidable fortune, which she sought to preserve by selling the company to Skydance in an $8 billion deal. Then came the controversy over the lawsuit – and the possibility of a settlement with Trump and its ties to Redstone’s pending big payday– that has roiled CBS. \n\nIn May, CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon resigned, saying, “It’s become clear that the company and I do not agree on the path forward.” The month before, “60 Minutes” boss Bill Owens quit, citing increased pressure from senior management over his programming.\n\nMedia watchdogs have condemned the network for allegedly selling its journalism for money. \n\nCongressional Democrats were threatening hearings on the matter and the Paramount board could have faced investigations from Trump-hating Democratic state AGs. Conservatives have complained about news bias at CBS for decades.\n\n That said, giving such investigations teeth is the dubious nature of the Trump lawsuit, namely that “60 Minutes” deceptively edited the Harris interview to make her sound smarter during the height of the 2024 campaign, and he was damaged in the process.\n\nSince Trump won the election, there are no damages, legal experts countered.Trump initially sued for $20 billion but his legal team signaled it was looking to settle for far less.\n\n“With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,” a legal spokesman for Trump told On The Money. \n\n“CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle. President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues his singular mission to Make America Great Again.”\n\nThe president also sued Disney’s ABC for defamation and received $16 million and an apology after “This Week” anchor George Stephanopolous misstated the facts surrounding a civil judgment against Trump.","summary":"The move should now clear the way for Paramount's long-awaited sale to independent studio Skydance.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/media/how-secret-side-deal-helped-seal-paramounts-16m-settlement-with-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/paramount-trump-lawsuit.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1751480101&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 23:12:47","author":"Charles Gasparino","authors":["Charles Gasparino"],"language":"en","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":337637036,"title":"‘If you want Medicaid, get a f***ing job!’ Republicans take hard line in support of Trump bill despite constituent worries","text":"Nancy Mace grabbed her team, hopped in a van and raced back to Washington in her pajamas Wednesday to vote on President Donald Trump’s “One Big, Beautiful Bill” — driving through stormy weather after scores of flights into D.C. were canceled.\n\nMace, who is currently weighing a run for governor of South Carolina, knows that she needs the president’s endorsement to win in a state that overwhelmingly supported him in 2024. So the mad dash, and the show she put on social media about it all, makes sense politically.\n\nBut while the audience of one in the White House will appreciate the effort, many constituents back home may be far less pleased. \n\nThat’s because the Trump megabill forces states to carry part of the cost of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, formerly known as food stamps, if they have high rates of overpaying or underpaying recipients. \n\nAnd Mace sounds ready to throw some pain in the direction of her home state in the name of fighting “waste, fraud and abuse.” \n\n“So under some of the provisions, our state may have to pay fines of upwards of $300 million if we don't get the fraudulent payments for SNAP under control,” she told The Independent. \n\nThe same goes for Medicaid.\n\n“But if you're talking about able-bodied workers,” she continued, “my policy is, if you're an able-bodied person and you want Medicaid? Get a f***ing job.” \n\nThe Trump bill also puts rural hospitals at risk due to changes in how states can raise money for Medicaid.\n\nIn Fiscal Year 2024, South Carolina had a 9.25 percent error rate for SNAP, according to statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. According to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, 64.7 percent of families in South Carolina on Medicaid have a full-time worker in their family. \n\n“We're gonna be fined $300 million a year if our government doesn't get its s*** together,” Mace said. “If I run for governor, you can be damn sure that's No. 1 on my list.” \n\nNew York Republican Rep. Mike Lawler, who represents a district that Democratic former Vice President Kamala Harris won in last year’s presidential election, echoed the sentiment. Like Mace, he is considering a run for governor and has long complained about the cap that the 2017 Trump tax cuts put on the State and Local Tax Deduction, commonly known as SALT \n\nBut Lawler said that the goal of the Trump legislation is to get states to run their programs properly. \n\n“That's the objective, to get the program fixed so they should be working towards it,” he told The Independent. New York has a 14.09 percent error rate for SNAP.\n\nRepublicans have long called for work requirements for social safety net programs, with some policy successes. But the current bill’s work- and cost-sharing provisions became a sticking point during the Senate debate. \n\nIn the Senate, Republicans cut a deal with Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, whose state has an inordinately high error rate partially because of its rural population, to exempt it state from the cost-sharing part of the bill, which Democrats excoriated. \n\nBut Rep. Buddy Carter, who is running for the Republican nomination to challenge Sen. Jon Ossoff in Georgia, defended the change in policy. \n\n“We improved the program,” he told The Independent. ‘We made sure that people who are on there should be on there, they're going to be off of that. Now we're going to make it better for those who truly need it.”\n\nCarter is running to represent a state with a large error rate of 15.65 percent.\n\nBut Democrats say this will hurt states’ ability to provide SNAP benefits. Rep. Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic nominee for governor in New Jersey, specifically said it was unfair, “especially from a state that sends $70 billion more to the federal government than we get back. \n\n“If they're not going to run their programs, why are we paying taxes?” Sherrill told The Independent.","summary":"Republicans have no problem with the fact the ‘One Big, Beautiful Bill’ could hurt people who vote for them and Trump","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/republicans-spending-bill-medicaid-snap-trump-mace-b2781493.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/02/20/30/GettyImages-2203348781.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/pg8LmyWK-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-02 22:50:54","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":337646012,"title":"'The Godfather Presidency': Donald Trump Facing Accusations He Is Running White House 'Like a Mob Boss'","text":"Donald Trump is going to make you an offer you can't refuse... and if you do, he will get his way regardless.\n\nAt least that is what some are claiming is happening during his presidency, as Trump is being accused of running the White House \"like a mob boss,\" RadarOnline.com can reveal.Do As You're Told?Representative Jamie Raskin has been open about his concerns about the current climate among legislators; some are terrified of pushing back against the controversial president, or even some of his powerful donors, who may make their lives a nightmare.\n\n\"If you’re a freshman Republican, and they’re telling you Elon Musk will spend $5 million in a primary to defeat you...

Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, and former Democratic congresswoman Abigail Spanberger.\n\n“This is what I think is going to happen,” he continued. “And [Trump’s] going to see retirements and people are going to start coming in.”\n\nCarville also predicted Trump would see these races and say, “‘We’re getting ready to lose.

It said the settlement did not involve an apology.\n\nTrump’s lawyer said the president had suffered “mental anguish” over the editing of the interview by CBS News, while Paramount and CBS rejected his contention that it was edited to enhance how Harris sounded. They had sought to get Trump’s lawsuit dismissed.\n\nThere was no immediate word from the White House about the settlement of the case, which Trump filed in Amarillo, Texas.\n\nThe case has been closely watched by advocates for press freedom and by journalists within CBS, whose lawyers called Trump’s lawsuit “completely without merit” and promised to vigorously fight it after it was filed.\n\nIn early February, “60 Minutes” released a full, unedited transcript of the interview.\n\nUnder the settlement reached with help of a mediator, Paramount agreed that “60 Minutes” will release transcripts of future interviews of presidential candidates, “subject to redactions as required for legal and national security concerns,” CBS News cited the statement as saying. \n\nTrump, who did not agree to be interviewed by “60 Minutes” during the campaign, protested editing where Harris is seen giving two different answers to a question by the show’s Bill Whitaker in separate clips aired on “60 Minutes” and “Face the Nation” earlier in the day.

Larry Jameson said in a statement. \"We recognize this and will apologize to those who experienced a competitive disadvantage or experienced anxiety because of the policies in effect at the time.\"\n\nThe agreement was born from the saga that began in 2021, when Lia Thomas, who identifies as a transgender woman, began swimming on the women's swimming team at Penn—ultimately setting three program records and clinching the NCAA Division 1 championship title for the 500-yard freestyle event. Thomas' participation during the 2021-2022 season poured fuel on a present but somewhat nascent national conversation about whether it is ever fair for someone born a biological male, with the associated physical advantages, to compete in girls' and women's sports.\n\n\"Today's resolution agreement with UPenn is yet another example of the Trump effect in action,\" said Education Secretary Linda McMahon in a statement yesterday. It is, by pretty much every measure, a big victory for President Donald Trump and his administration. It didn't have to be.\n\nThat's because the NCAA—which in February reversed its policy allowing transgender women to compete in women's sports—should never have set such a policy to begin with. Much of the blame here has fallen on Penn. That is misguided, at least in part, as the problem is far broader: Competing universities adhere to the eligibility requirements set by the NCAA, lest they risk inviting legal scrutiny. It was the NCAA's policy that was unfair to female competitors. It was unfair to Thomas, who became a national villain for participating and a symbol of institutional rot in collegiate athletics. And it set the stage for the Trump administration to make a very, very easy layup, as the vast majority of Americans support trans-identified athletes competing in the category corresponding to the sex they were assigned at birth.\n\nSomething being popular, however, does not necessarily mean it is right. Far more important here is the science. \"There are profound sex differences in human performance in athletic events determined by strength, speed, power, endurance, and body size such that males outperform females,\" write Michael J. Joyner, Sandra K. Hunter, and Jonathon W. Senefeld in the Journal of Applied Physiology. They note that \"differences in athletic performance exist before puberty\" and conclude, most relevantly, that \"testosterone suppression among XY athletes who have experienced masculinizing puberty, modestly reduces athletic performance, but a large male-female performance gap remains.\" (Thomas began hormone replacement therapy in May 2019, more than meeting the NCAA's one-year minimum requirement.)\n\nAnd while Joyner, Hunter, and Senefeld do not call out Thomas by name, they appear to find the situation somewhat dispositive in the context of the broader debate. \"A case report of an adult testosterone-suppressed XY swimmer (transgender woman) demonstrated [that] although swimmer performance times slowed, both relative competitive success and relative ranking/placement markedly improved competing in the female category compared with success and ranking in the male category,\" the three write. In the 500-yard freestyle, Thomas ranked 65th nationally for men's swimming—and won the national title in women's. The researchers found about a 5 percent performance decline after hormone therapy, \"a magnitude which is ∼50% smaller,\" they write, \"than the typical male-female performance gap.\" Other studies come to very similar conclusions.\n\nThat should be neither a surprise nor a partisan talking point. Men have more muscle mass, larger hearts, greater bone density, and deeper lung capacity than women. That is not bigoted—it just is. Some things transcend ideology or political affiliation.\n\nIt is why in 2017, two years after Allyson Felix, the Olympic dynamite runner, ran a personal best of 49.26 seconds in the 400-meter final at the 2015 Beijing World Championships, men and boys around the world reportedly beat that over 15,000 times. It is why, if I may betray my affection for figure skating, it is still novel for women to land the triple Axel—which requires 3.5 rotations in the air—whereas it has long been all but mandatory for a man if he wants to compete successfully at the national and international levels. The reason is not a mystery.\n\nIn a compelling essay, Reason's Natalie Dowzicky, a former NCAA Division I swimmer, wrote in 2022 that she had \"tried to calculate how much total time I spent swimming or training\" since she began the sport and that it was \"in the ballpark of 21,900 hours—2 and a half years of my life.\" Declining to acknowledge the science may be well-intentioned; transgender people certainly deserve respect, kindness, and decency, which are often conspicuously missing from the conversation around transgender issues generally. But for the last several years, many people have refused to concede that there is a cost when it comes to sports: fairness to female athletes, who compete in a sex-segregated category specifically because of the real physical distinctions at play.\n\nIt is not unlike Trump to weaponize his immense power and influence to retaliate against people and institutions in gross ways. He has targeted law firms he dislikes. He filed a laughable $20 billion lawsuit against Paramount for editing an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris in a manner that offended his ego.

Though many voters were undecided, Harris was the choice of 41% of survey respondents, compared to 29% who opted for an unnamed Republican candidate, according to a poll by the University of California Irvine. She also had the greatest favorability ratings and is most well known compared to all of the candidates who have announced. “The path to governor seems well-paved for Vice President Harris if she decides to run,” said Jon Gould, dean of UCI's School of Social Ecology, in a statement. \"Although she lacks majority support at the moment, people know her better than the other candidates and generally view her favorably.\" Only 5% of Californians had never heard of Harris, while every other announced candidate was unknown by a far larger number of respondents, including those who had run for statewide office previously. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who ran for governor in 2018, was unknown by 47% of survey respondents; 48% were unfamiliar with former Rep. Katie Porter of Irvine, who ran for U.S. Senate in 2024. When tested against candidates who have announced, Harris was the choice of 24% of voters, the only candidate to crack double digits, according to the poll. However, 40% of respondents were undecided, according to the poll. Among Democrats, who account for 47% of the state's voters as of February, Harris had the support of nearly half, while every announced candidate had single-digit support. Harris led among Californians in every region and in every racial group, according to the poll. Billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso, a Democrat who unsuccessfully ran for mayor of Los Angeles in 2022 and is reportedly debating whether to run for mayor again or governor, was the favored choice of GOP voters, with the backing of 27% of survey respondents. Harris, whose representatives did not respond to a request for comment, is expected to decide whether she enters the race by the end of the summer, a delay that has prompted criticism from several candidates in the crowded field of candidates who have already announced their bids. The statewide poll of 4,143 Californians was conducted online in two separate polls, one between May 27 and June 2, and another between May 29 and June 4. The margin of error in either direction varies between 2.9% and 3.6%, according to UCI.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala hasn't decided whether she will run for California governor next year, but a new poll released Wednesday shows that she would be a favorite of voters if she does.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-07-02/former-vice-president-kamala-harris-a-favorite-in-governors-race-if-she-runs-according-to-new-poll","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/50496b6/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6296x3305+0+446/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc5%2Fea%2F0d3f02284abbb689e21f28f2c1df%2Fdemocrats-harris-121","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 21:34:41","author":"Seema Mehta","authors":["Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.015},{"id":337633822,"title":"“No One Is Happy About It.” CBS Staffers Were Tired of the Paramount Drama, but the Settlement Intensifies Media-Capitulation Concerns","text":"And yet, according to this source, “The general sense is no one is happy about it.”\nIn a near midnight agreement on Tuesday, Paramount settled the defamation lawsuit launched over the editing of a preelection interview on 60 Minutes featuring then vice president Kamala Harris. Under the terms, Paramount has agreed to pay a total of $16 million, all of which will be allocated to his future presidential library, minus legal fees. In a statement, Paramount specified that the settlement “does not include a statement of apology or regret,” however, going forward, “60 Minutes will release transcripts of interviews with eligible US presidential candidates after such interviews have aired.”\nWarren called for an investigation into the network’s settlement Wednesday, arguing that “this could be bribery in plain sight.” She added that “Paramount should be ashamed of putting its profits over independent journalism.” Warren also emphasized a “glaring need for rules to restrict donations to sitting presidents’ libraries,” and she will soon be introducing legislation to “rein in corruption.” Senator Bernie Sanders also released a statement slamming the settlement, characterizing Trump’s defamation lawsuit as “bogus” and arguing that “the Redstone family diminished the freedom of the press today in exchange for a $2.4 billion payday.”\n“Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,” a Paramount Global spokesperson said in a statement to Vanity Fair in response to concerns of bribery. “Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction.”\nIn a news story reporting the settlement, Benjamin Mullin, Michael Grynbaum, Lauren Hirsch, and David Enrich of The New York Times called the agreement an “extraordinary concession to a sitting president by a major media organization,” as well as “the clearest sign yet that Mr. Trump’s ability to intimidate major American institutions extends to the media industry.”\nThe Writers Guild of America East, which represents many staffers at CBS News, torched the settlement as a “transparent attempt to curry favors with an administration in the hopes it will allow [the] Paramount Global and Skydance Media merger to be cleared for approval. Paramount’s decision to capitulate to Trump threatens journalists’ ability to do their job reporting on powerful public figures.” Reporters Without Borders, an international nonprofit organization, called the settlement a “shameful decision” by Redstone and the company. “A line is being drawn between the owners of American news media who are willing to stand up for press freedom and those who capitulate to the demands of the president.”\nInside the CBS newsroom, CBS News president and executive editor Tom Cibrowski addressed the settlement on Wednesday’s editorial call, emphasizing that CBS News was not required to apologize as part of the agreement, according to CNN’s Brian Stelter. Cibrowski’s comments included some words of appreciation for CBS News staffers, thanking them for “blocking out the noise” during the legal turmoil. The staffer tells me that while “people aren’t happy about the idea of settling and there’s sadness about it, there’s also an acceptance that for 99% of people, this is out of their hands.”\nThe lawsuit has generated significant upheaval within CBS News, with the resignation of 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens, who cited the inability to “make independent decisions” about the program as reasoning for his exit, amid looming legal challenges. Just one month later, the president of CBS News, Wendy McMahon, departed the network, telling staffers in a memo that “it’s become clear the company and I do not agree on the path forward.” Meanwhile, Paramount is in the midst of completing a multibillion-dollar sale to Skydance, which would take the financial pressure off of chair and controlling shareholder of Paramount Shari Redstone and place the company in the hands of Skydance CEO David Ellison. Just last month, Fox Business senior correspondent Charles Gasparino told me in an interview that Redstone “has a huge tax bill. She’s wrapped up in this melting ice cube of a company.” He added that Skydance isn’t interested in the company for the news network. “The business that they’re arguing over is something that could go away in literally three or five years.”\nA source close to Redstone tells me that she “very much recused herself” from the settlement negotiation process, adding that “she would be an idiot to play a role.” According to the source, Redstone signaled that she would like to settle, but left the specifics of the settlement up to mediators. “I don’t think she was heavy-handed in the negotiations, nor would it be prudent for her to have been,” they added.\nMeanwhile, Redstone is also battling thyroid cancer and has been “really focused on her health, even though this whole situation might have, in her mind, caused her cancer from all the stress,” the source said. While some were shocked when Puck reported that Redstone was not on the list for this year’s Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, an annual event frequented by media moguls and billionaires, the source noted that her absence was “simply because of health.”","summary":"As Elizabeth Warren calls for an investigation, staffers within the news division of the media giant have expressed a combination of disappointment and “acceptance” over a settlement with Donald Trump that was “out of their hands.”","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/cbs-tired-paramount-drama-settlement-capitulation-concerns","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6865812634263bd9411c1886/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/CBS-Broadcast-Center.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 21:31:39","author":"Natalie Korach","authors":["Natalie Korach"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.092},{"id":337620790,"title":"Paramount CEO claims Trump legal settlement avoided ‘reputational damage’ — but insiders cry BS: ‘Can spin it any way he wants’","text":"Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks on Wednesday insisted the $16 million settlement with President Donald Trump to squash his $20 billion lawsuit saved the company from “reputational damage.”\n\nBut network insiders weren’t buying it.\n\nThey slammed parent company Paramount’s capitulation over the controversial “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris and said the brand has already been tarnished.\n\n“What the f-k is he talking about? The damage has already been done,” a veteran CBS journalist told The Post on Wednesday. “Trump has trashed them for what a year now? (Cheeks) can spin it any way he wants.”\n\nA second CBS insider lamented: “It’s a sad day for the journalistic community. The reputational damage to ’60 Minutes’ is seismic.”\n\nCheeks, the CEO of CBS and part of the three-headed hydra running Paramount, spoke hours after the media giant agreed late Tuesday night to to pay Trump $16 million — the same amount ABC forked over to the president in December to settle a defamation suit. \n\nOn a conference call during the company’s annual shareholders meeting, Cheeks said the move helped CBS avoid a costly legal battle and “an adverse” judgment that could produce “significant financial as well as reputational damage.” \n\nThe network will also set aside another $15 million to $20 million for public service announcements in support of conservative causes in the future, sources told The Post’s Charles Gasparino on Wednesday.\n\nAside from the financial hit, the settlement in the lawsuit, filed in Texas last December, will also force the network to promptly release full, unedited transcripts of future presidential candidates’ interviews — referred to as the “Trump Rule,” sources told The Post.\n\nHowever, CBS was able to squirm out of having to apologize over Trump’s allegation that “60 Minutes” deceptively edited the Harris sit-down weeks before the election to make her sound more coherent — a hot button issue that has roiled the network.\n\n“There’s 16 million apologies in the settlement. Trump got two heads. He got Bill Owens’ head and he got Wendy McMahon’s head and he got $16 million,” one of the network insiders said.\n\nOwens, the longtime executive producer of “60 Minutes” resigned in April, citing a loss of journalistic independence as Paramount was embroiled in settlement talks with Trump.\n\nHis former boss, CBS News CEO Wendy McMahon, stepped down a month later, saying it became “clear” that she and the company didn’t agree on a “path forward.”\n\nAnother CBS source with knowledge of the situation credited Cheeks for moving past this dark chapter in the Tiffany Network’s history and helping to clear a major hurdle for Paramount’s pending $8 billion merger with independent studio Skydance Media.\n\nCheeks is expected to take a leadership role at the company once the Skydance deal goes through.\n\n“George did what he had to do to get the merger done,” the source said. “He was told he had to clean house in leadership. He was told he needed to change the editorial policy. Sacrifices had to be made to get the lawsuit settled and George made them. The money is just part of the story.”\n\nCBS will not have to acknowledge any journalistic wrongdoing with the settlement. \n\n“The settlement will include a release of all claims regarding any CBS reporting through the date of the settlement, including the Texas action and the threatened defamation action,” Paramount said in a statement.\n\nAttention will now turn to the Federal Communications Commission. Trump-appointed chair Brendan Carr launched a probe into whether the network violated the agency’s “news distortion” policy after a conservative group filed a complaint over the alleged deceptive editing.\n\nShari Redstone, Paramount’s controlling shareholder, is poised to walk away with about $1.75 billion if the merger is approved.\n\nSources speculated that with the lawsuit behind Paramount, the merger will get regulatory approval in the coming weeks.\n\n“I think Shari Redstone and George Cheeks are wiping their hands of CBS News,” one of the sources said. \n\n“The new owners are inheriting a greatly diminished asset.”\n\nA rep for Paramount said: “This lawsuit is completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process. We will abide by the legal process to defend our case.”\n\nRedstone, 71, may be leaving her media empire, but she will be rewarded with some of the trappings of her high-flying life\n\nSkydance and its investor in the deal, RedBird Capital Partners, agreed to take on National Amusements’ financial obligations and pay for the remainder of Redstone’s lease for her private jet, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Hollywood production company also will cover the expenses for her Central Park-area apartment in New York City for the next few years, according to reports.\n\nThe merger between Skydance and Paramount has been a prolonged process with both sides finally agreeing to a deal last June after fits and starts.","summary":"\"What the f-k is he talking about?

Sign up for the newsletter to get it in your in-box.\n\nI said from the beginning that if the conservatives in the House Freedom Caucus had any respect for consistency of their message and believed any of their stated principles, there is no way they could vote for the Big Beautiful Bill. Most of those Freedom Caucus members have spent their entire career in Congress warning about deficit spending. They are now staring down the most expensive piece of legislation in American history, which will add trillions of dollars of red ink and interest payments to the ballooning national debt. On their terms, it’s a bill that betrays everything they have spent a lifetime fighting for.\n\nAnd on top of that, everything that they were handed as a nod to those stated beliefs during negotiations over the House version of the bill was degraded or stripped away by the Senate. So basic self-respect dictated that they could not possibly go through with capitulating to the likes of Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) on the final bill.\n\nAnd yet, going into voting on Wednesday, I did not believe that would be the case. I still don’t totally believe it. Because none of these Freedom Caucus members have taken that step to move to no.\n\nReps. Chip Roy (R-TX) and Ralph Norman (R-SC), two stalwarts of the House Freedom Caucus, voted against the Senate concurrence of the Big Beautiful Bill in the Rules Committee on Tuesday night. But that was a free vote, a way to express displeasure without tanking the bill. If they did the same on the House floor, they would likely have Freedom Caucus backup from a dozen members, and it’s very likely that the bill couldn’t pass.\n\nThe votes on Wednesday started off fine, but suddenly, a vote sequence that included the rule for debate stalled for hours. There were eight holdouts, and the voting was just stuck. Meanwhile, the Freedom Caucus put out almost a ransom note about the Senate version of the bill’s “failures.”\n\nMany complaints are familiar. First off, the Senate version violates the so-called fiscal framework, which was hard-wired into the budget resolution. They call it $1 of tax cuts for $1 of spending cuts; in reality they are putting their thumb on the scale by claiming that increased economic growth offsets $2.5 trillion in tax cuts over a decade. But even with that generosity, the Senate bill would have an excess $761 billion in tax cuts that aren’t offset by spending cuts, and adding interest on the debt, that number balloons to $1.3 trillion. If you include the expectation that temporary tax cuts will eventually be made permanent (like the five-year raise in the state and local tax deduction cap, and the four-year Trump tax promises like no tax on tips or overtime pay), along with other provisions the Freedom Caucus things are being undercounted, you have trillions more in red ink. The caucus considers that unacceptable.\n\nThe renewable energy tax credits that the Freedom Caucus wanted to rapidly eliminate were given a year of new life by the Senate, and the Senate also weakened “foreign entity of concern” restrictions that would have kept subsidies away from projects using the tiniest amount of Chinese components. These measures were the main win for Freedom Caucus Republicans in the House version of the bill, and they feel the Senate erased them.\n\nThe Freedom Caucus’s desire to target waste, fraud, and abuse were upended by one of the most ridiculous provisions in the history of the Congress. This part of the Trump bill would force states to help pay for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), thus pushing them to cut enrollment. The idea was that states with higher error rates would pay more into the program, creating the talking point that it was a measure to cut fraud in SNAP. But Murkowski got a delay on the cost-sharing, specifically for states that have the highest error rates, literally incentivizing waste, fraud, and abuse to avoid those payments. This was done for the benefit of Alaska (which has the highest payment error rates) to grab Murkowski’s vote, and the Freedom Caucus decries the “pork to buy Senate votes” in their bill.\n\nOther complaints have to do with things the Senate parliamentarian threw out of the bill because they didn’t comply with the particular requirements of budget reconciliation. That includes several efforts to deny benefits to undocumented immigrants in operatic ways, like requiring parents seeking benefits for their citizen children to have Social Security numbers, for example. The restriction from using Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program for gender-affirming care was also a casualty of the parliamentarian, as was a change in registration for gun silencers, and a requirement to grandfather in current repayment plans for student loan borrowers. I don’t know what the Freedom Caucus expects here when the provisions were ruled out of order, short of firing the parliamentarian, which the Senate leadership rejected.\n\nStill other parts are just whiny. While the caucus didn’t like the handout to wealthy blue state residents with the state and local tax deduction, they all voted for it in the House. The Senate cut it by reducing the length to five years, and the Freedom Caucus still doesn’t like that, rightly suggesting that it would be extended. The caucus liked the deeper Medicaid cuts in the Senate bill but wanted to reduce the 90 percent Medicaid expansion federal share—again, something that was not in the House bill but something they just hoped the Senate would do—so they’re big mad about that.\n\nFinally, the Freedom Caucus lists a bunch of small ticky-tack Senate changes that they don’t like, which reveals just how dug in they are. This includes the Senate cutting a tax on remittances from 3.5 percent to 1 percent, eliminating most of the House’s expansion on Health Savings Accounts, limiting the defunding of Planned Parenthood to one year, killing a tax break for foreign-owned tobacco companies, adding a radiation health coverage bill that was intended to secure the vote of Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO), cutting the endowment tax from 21 percent to 8 percent, inserting a tax on imported Puerto Rican rum, and a bunch more.\n\nMore fundamentally, the Freedom Caucus only exists because it operates as a bloc that demands its ideas be reflected in legislation. If they get rolled this easily, they might as well disband.\n\nBut importantly, this is not a list of demands; it’s just a list of failures. The House Republican leadership outsourced the task of whipping Freedom Caucus votes to the White House. And after the meeting, you heard more about “needing assurances” and less about not voting for the bill at all.\n\nIn order to truly believe that the Freedom Caucus is going to tank the bill, they’re going to have to actually vote against it. Not hold out, not fold their arms and grumble. Actually vote against it. And we still haven’t seen that.\n\nAs a result, while the timeline of this bill may slip, there’s just no actual evidence that the bill itself may slip. Not yet.\n\nThere’s another breed of Republican that’s even less likely than the Freedom Caucus to do that, even as they see the bill as detrimental to their political survival. Forcing 17 million people out of their health insurance coverage is not viable for the few Republicans in districts Trump lost. They know they are kissing their time in Congress goodbye if they agree to this legislation. Rep. David Valadao (R-CA), whose district has one of the largest concentrations of Medicaid recipients in the country, who voted to impeach Trump during his first term, and whose district Joe Biden and Kamala Harris won, has said he cannot possibly vote for this bill. And Rep. Greg Murphy (R-NC), a doctor, has been poking holes in the Medicaid cuts and their apocalyptic real-world impact.\n\nBut again, as of late Wednesday afternoon, nobody in the House Republican caucus had actually voted no. Holdouts are not the same as opposers. Outside of Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), who’s already done it, I don’t see a lot of conviction to defy Donald Trump from House Republicans, mad though they may be.\n\nAs Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) said on the House floor, kicking off Wednesday’s debate, “I say to my Republican colleagues, what’s wrong with you people?... Jesus Christ, what are you people thinking?” The answer is they are not.\n\nThe Republican Party’s shift into a cult of personality means that appeals to reason, to consistency, even to electoral reality, means less than what the Dear Leader says must be done. This is the entire Trump agenda, and the pressure on House Republicans to cast aside their brains and go along with it is immense.","summary":"The House Freedom Caucus keeps saying they don’t want to vote for this bill.

Jean Carroll, when he was found liable for sexual abuse.\n\nJameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, called the Paramount settlement \"a sad day for press freedom.\" \n\n\"This was a frivolous lawsuit and the payment being described as a 'settlement' bears no relation to Paramount's actual legal exposure in the case, which was negligible,\" he said in a statement.\n\n\"Paramount should have fought this extortionate lawsuit in court, and it would have prevailed.

Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy KATE DENNETT FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:21:15 BST, 2 July 2025 |Updated:21:29 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nOzzy Osbourne has discussed saying 'goodbye' to Black Sabbath fans at his upcoming final show.\nThe rock star, 76, will reunite with Black Sabbath at their Back To The Beginning concert, due to be held at Birmingham's Villa Park on July 5.\nOzzy has undergone seven surgeries in the past five years, including a fourth spinal operation in September 2023, and has been privately battling Parkinson's disease since 2003.\nThough he plans to continue recording music, his upcoming gig will mark the last time he performs live and Ozzy has emotionally discussed what the show means to him. \n'It's my final encore; it's my chance to say thank you to my fans for always supporting me and being there for me,' he shared.\n'It means everything, I am forever in their debt for showing up for me and the fans. I can't quite put it into words, but I feel very emotional and blessed.' \n\nOzzy Osbourne (pictured in September 2022) has discussed saying 'goodbye' to Black Sabbath fans at his upcoming final show\n\nThe rock star, 76, will reunite with Black Sabbath at their Back To The Beginning concert at Birmingham's Villa Park on July 5 (the band are pictured in a previously unseen photo in 1972) \n'It's a goodbye as far as my live performances go, and what a way to go out,' he added.\nOzzy said he wants his fans to 'feel appreciated for how much they mean to me' and discussed why the band decided to host their final ever show in Birmingham.\nOzzy grew up in Aston, Birmingham, and Black Sabbath - though they were known as Earth at the time - had their first ever gig at The Crown pub in Birmingham in 1968.\nAptly titled Back To The Beginning, the concert will see Ozzy and his bandmates Tony Iommi, Geezer Butler and Bill Ward go back to their roots for their big reunion.\nOf the poignant moment, Ozzy gushed: 'I couldn't have done my final show anywhere else. I had to go back to the beginning.'\nHe went on: 'My memories of Villa Park when I was growing up were: Every Saturday when there was a match, I would go out with my friends and stand outside the Villa asking people for a shilling to watch their car.'\nThe concert will be streamed two hours after the in-arena start time, kicking off at 3pm BST, giving Black Sabbath fans around the globe a chance to watch.\nHowever, Ozzy said they never actually planned to stream the show but decided to include it as an extra addition due to the overwhelming demand for tickets. \n\nThough he plans to continue recording music, his upcoming gig will mark the last time he performs live and Ozzy (pictured in 2024) has discussed what the show means to him\n\nOzzy grew up in Aston, Birmingham, and Black Sabbath - though they were known as Earth at the time - had their first ever gig at The Crown pub in Birmingham in 1968\n'We never meant to have a livestream; it wasn't in our plan,' he shared.\n'I was just surprised how many people we were contacted by to do one, and so it seemed a great chance for people who didn't have the opportunity to get a ticket to be able to see the show.'\nAmid his ailing health, Ozzy recently admitted he is unsure whether to perform standing up or sitting down following a series of spinal operations.\nThe singer is currently in strict training, which even sees his blood pressure being taken 15 times a day.\nHe explained: 'I have got this trainer guy who helps people get back to normal. It's hard going, but he's convinced that he can pull it off for me. I'm giving it everything I've got.\n'It's endurance. The first thing that goes when you're laid up is your stamina.\n'I am having my blood pressure taken 15 times a day.. I've got this f***ing device on my finger. It's a monitor to say how my heart rate is.'\nOzzy vowed to do the 'best he can' during his final show after his string of health concerns in recent years.\n\nOzzy (pictured in 2014) has undergone seven surgeries in the past five years, including a fourth spinal operation in September 2023, and has been battling Parkinson's disease \nThough he is stepping back from the stage, Ozzy will keep recording music after his goodbye gig. \nHe told Metal Hammer magazine: 'I still enjoy doing my own work, I also enjoy singing on other people's work. \n'For the foreseeable future, I will keep on recording if the projects interest me, it's very important.'\nOzzy's last solo album, 2022's Patient Number 9, featured a long list of guest artists, including hid Black Sabbath bandmate Tony Iommi, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Zakk Wylde, and Pearl Jam's Mike McCready, among others. \nBlack Sabbath pioneered heavy metal music in the early 1970s with hits such as War Pigs, Paranoid and Iron Man.\nSince their last gig together in 2005, Black Sabbath has played in partial reunions but never in their original line-up.\nSpecial guests on the bill for Black Sabbath's reunion include Metallica, Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan, Duff McKagan and Slash of Guns 'N Roses, Limp Bizkit's Fred Durst, Korn star Jonathan Davis, and Anthrax.\nOzzy OsbourneBirmingham\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOzzy Osbourne, 76, emotionally discusses saying 'goodbye' to Black Sabbath fans at his upcoming final show amid his ailing health\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., blasted Paramount Global on Wednesday for settling President Donald Trump’s “election interference” lawsuit against CBS over the network’s handling of a “60 Minutes” interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nSanders previously urged Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone not to settle the lawsuit he called an “attack on the First Amendment” but to no avail. The company agreed to an eight-figure payment and changes to its editorial policy on Tuesday night in what media critics called a shameful capitulation.\n\n“The decision by the Redstone family, the major owners of Paramount, to settle a bogus lawsuit with President Trump over a 60 Minutes report he did not like is an extremely dangerous precedent in terms of both the First Amendment and government extortion,” Sanders said to begin his scathing statement.\n\n“Paramount’s decision will only embolden Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media which he has labeled ‘the enemy of the people.’ It is a dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press — an essential part of our democracy,” Sanders continued. “It is a victory for a president who is attempting to stifle dissent and undermine American democracy.\n\nTrump will receive $16 million upfront. This will cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes, to be determined at Trump’s discretion.\n\nThere is an anticipation that there will be another allocation in the mid-eight figures set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future, Fox News Digital has learned. Current Paramount management disputes the additional allocation, but a long-planned merger with Skydance Media is set to put new leadership in place.\n\n“It’s pretty obvious why Paramount chose to surrender to Trump. The Redstone family is in line to receive $2.4 billion from the sale of Paramount to Skydance, but they can only receive this money if the Trump administration approves this deal. In other words, the Redstone family diminished the freedom of the press today in exchange for a $2.4 billion payday,” Sanders added.\n\n“Make no mistake about it. Trump is undermining our democracy and rapidly moving us towards authoritarianism and the billionaires who care more about their stock portfolios than our democracy are helping him do it,” Sanders added. “That is beyond unacceptable.”\n\nA source familiar with Paramount’s current leadership told Fox News Digital that only the initial $16 million was sanctioned by the official mediator, and they had no knowledge of any deal Trump may have made with incoming ownership.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., also took to X to accuse Paramount of taking a “bribe” and threatened future federal charges.\n\n“Paramount just paid Trump a bribe for merger approval. When Democrats retake power, I’ll be first in line calling for federal charges. In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court, today,” Wyden posted.\n\nParamount insisted it was business as usual when asked about statements made by Sanders and Wyden.\n\n“Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction,” a Paramount spokesperson told Fox News Digital.\n\nA source close to Trump mocked the liberal lawmakers.\n\n“The socialists of the Democrat Party, like Sanders and Wyden, have rarely seen a business transaction where they didn’t want a full government intervention. President Trump is running circles around them and all they do is cry,” the source told Fox News Digital.\n\nTrump’s legal team took a victory lap after the settlement was announced.\n\n“With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit. CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle. \n\n“President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again,” a spokesperson for Trump’s legal team told Fox News Digital.","summary":"Sanders says CBS parent set bad precedent in case of 'government extortion.'","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/07/02/media/bernie-sanders-blasts-paramount-says-lawsuit-settlement-will-further-embolden-trump-to-attack-media/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/07/107518325.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 20:25:14","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":-0.606},{"id":337614008,"title":"Keanu Reeves signs up for F1 docuseries as Brad Pitt's movie is a box office smash","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jul 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat - or WHO - caused Rachel Reeves's tears that sparked turmoil in the markets?

In its filing, the company cites a “severely strained liquidity position” and the failure to secure additional outside capital as reasons for the declaration. It also mentions ongoing legal issues with Trinity Broadcasting and the Professional Bull Riders as contributing factors.\n\nRelated Stories\n\nDr. Phil's Media Company Merit TV Hires New CEO (Exclusive)\n\nDr. Phil Says Donald Trump \"Understands Importance of Allies\" in Israel Support\n\nIn conjunction with the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court’s North Texas Division (Merit Street is based in Fort Worth), Merit Street has sued Trinity for breach of contract, claiming the broadcaster, best known for its Christian programming, failed to live up to the terms of their joint venture.\n\n“Trinity Broadcasting Network is being sued by Merit Street Media for failing to provide clearly agreed-upon national distribution and other significant foundational commitments critical to the network’s continuing success and viability,” a Merit Street spokesperson said in a statement. “The suit is part of a restructuring proceeding also initiated by MSM.”\n\nThe Professional Bull Riders organization isn’t named in the suit but is mentioned in the bankruptcy filing. Merit Street bought rights to air PBR events on its Merit TV channel, but the group pulled its programming in November 2024, saying Merit Street had yet to make any rights payments. The two parties are currently in arbitration.\n\nMeritTV has also made headlines for its “behind the scenes” view of Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids in Chicago and Los Angeles this year as Dr. Phil as taken up a role as an unofficial spokesperson for President Trump in advocating for the raids.\n\nMcGraw’s Peteski Productions company provided “substantial capital infusions” to Merit Street to help cover expenses, the bankruptcy filing says, but Merit Street couldn’t close a round of equity financing, leading to the Chapter 11 filing.\n\nThe lawsuit against Trinity Broadcasting alleges that shortly after Merit TV’s launch, TBN “began to abuse its power as a controlling shareholder” and, among other things, caused Merit Street to enter into expensive distribution deals with third parties rather than through its own network of local TV stations; engaged in self-dealing by leasing TBN studio space to produce McGraw’s shows; and provided “shoddy production services.”\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nFilm and TV Tax Credits\n\nGavin Newsom Signs $750 Million Boost to Hollywood As California Tries to Save Jobs\n\nElizabeth Warren Calls for Bribery Investigation Into Paramount-Trump Settlement as Blowback Widens\n\nParamount Global\n\nInside CBS News, Staffers Voice Disgust, Anger, Relief and Anxiety After Trump Settlement\n\nParamount Settles Lawsuit With Trump Over Kamala Harris ’60 Minutes’ Interview for $16 Million\n\nDodgers’ DEI Efforts Targeted By Stephen Miller-Backed Group After ICE Standoff\n\nWarner Music Group\n\nWarner Music Group to Undergo Layoffs as Part of $300 Million Cost-Savings Plan\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 The Hollywood Reporter, LLC.

The suit, filed in October 2024, alleged CBS News deceptively edited a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris. \n\nTrump claimed the edits favored the Democratic Party. The settlement, announced on July 2, 2025, avoids a trial and includes no apology from Paramount.\n\nLawsuit Allegations\n\nTrump has initiated a lawsuit in Amarillo, Texas, claiming CBS broadcasted two versions of an interview with Harris. These versions reportedly depicted her giving varying answers to a question regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict.\n\nTrump initially sought $10 billion, later raising the claim to $20 billion. He argued the edits violated Texas consumer protection laws.\n\nCBS called the lawsuit “completely without merit” and sought dismissal.\n\nThe lawsuit argues that CBS, through its program 60 Minutes, maliciously edited Harris’s interview — at the time she was the US vice-president and a Democratic presidential candidate — to deliberately favor the Democratic party during the election. Trump, when campaigning last year, mentioned revoking CBS’s broadcasting license if he were to be elected.\nAdditionally, the lawsuit accuses CBS of airing two different interview versions where Harris seems to offer distinct responses to the same Israel-Hamas war question. CBS has countered that the lawsuit is “completely without merit” and requested its dismissal by a judge. —The Guardian\n\nSettlement Details\n\nParamount agreed to pay $16 million, allocated to Trump’s future presidential library or charitable causes. The settlement includes Trump’s legal fees.\n\nCBS also committed to releasing transcripts of future presidential candidate interviews, with possible redactions for legal or national security reasons.\n\nThis policy, dubbed the “Trump Rule,” aims to increase transparency. A Trump legal team spokesperson called the settlement “another win for the American people.”\n\nSocial Media Reaction\n\nThe settlement sparked discussion on X. Breanna Morello posted on July 2, 2025, detailing the agreement.\n\nMorello’s post highlighted claims of an additional sum for conservative causes, though Paramount disputes this allocation.\n\nBroader Context\n\nThe Trump CBS Settlement coincides with Paramount’s $8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media, pending Federal Communications Commission approval.\n\nThe FCC, led by Trump appointee Brendan Carr, is reviewing the deal. Some lawmakers, including Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, warned the settlement might violate bribery laws.\n\nThey argued it could influence Trump’s administration. Paramount maintains the lawsuit and merger are unrelated.\n\nMedia Industry Impact\n\nThe settlement follows similar media concessions. ABC News paid Trump $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit. Meta Platforms paid $25 million over Trump’s account suspension.\n\nCBS News staff expressed concerns about editorial integrity. The agreement, finalized after mediation began in April 2025, reflects ongoing tensions between media and the Trump administration.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nParamount Global settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: CBS Agrees to $16M Settlement with Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/cbs-agrees-to-16m-settlement-with-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Trump-Wins-16M-in-CBS-Lawsuit-Settlement.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 20:09:52","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.021},{"id":337616078,"title":"Restaurant workers say ‘no tax on tips’ undermined by benefits cuts","text":"United States President Donald Trump’s big tax and spending bill has faced backlash from both Democrats and fiscal hawks in his own party. But one proposal that has received rare bipartisan support from the start — eliminating taxes on tips.\n\nThe Senate bill passed on Tuesday, which mirrors the House bill passed last month, would deliver this campaign promise from Trump and had also been proposed by his Democratic opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nThe House plan lets workers deduct all reported tips from their taxable income, while the Senate version sets limits — $18,500 for individuals or $25,000 for joint filers — and phases it out for higher earners. The tax break would expire at the end of 2028.\n\nIf this bill passes, filers could deduct some or all of those tips starting in 2026.\n\nEconomists forecast that cutting tax on tips could increase the federal deficits by $100bn over the next decade.\n\nMany restaurant workers continue to earn the federal tipped minimum wage, or subminimum wage, of just $2.13 per hour nationally. It is slightly higher in places like New York at $3.55 per hour. The law assumes that tips will bridge the gap to reach the $7.25 federal minimum wage.\n\nA survey cited by the White House and conducted by a fintech firm found that 83 percent of restaurant workers support a no-tax-on-tips policy. Trump’s plan has been endorsed by the National Restaurant Association.\n\n“The inclusion of the No Tax on Tips and No Tax on Overtime provisions recognises the value of our dedicated workforce. More than two million tipped servers and bartenders stand to benefit, while the overtime measure rewards the commitment of over 13 million hourly team members across the sector,” Michelle Korsmo, president and CEO of the National Restaurant Association, told Al Jazeera in a statement.\n\nThe bill at the surface promises to put more money in the pockets of servers, bartenders, and other tipped workers. But it has been criticised by worker-centric advocacy groups and restaurant workers themselves, who caution against embracing it too quickly because it also comes with cuts to Medicaid and SNAP, which workers in the restaurant industry disproportionately rely on.\n\n“That is like one of like the biggest fears I have right now. I rely on SNAP myself. I rely on Medicaid. At one point, I didn’t have insurance because of the whole sub-minimum wage, ” Jessica Ordenana, a server at a Chili’s Restaurant in Queens, New York told Al Jazeera.\n\nAccording to One Fair Wage, about 66 percent of tipped workers in the US don’t earn enough to pay federal income tax, so eliminating tax on tips wouldn’t help the majority of restaurant workers.\n\nTo put this in perspective, a worker earning $2.13 per hour, working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks, would earn just $4,430.40 annually. Employers are legally required to make up the difference if tips don’t bring workers to $7.25/hour, totalling $15,078 per year. Federal income taxes must be paid by those who make more than $14,600 annually. Many workers still fall short due to inconsistent schedules and unreliable tipping.\n\nWork requirements complications\n\nRestaurant tipped workers overwhelmingly rely on services like SNAP and Medicaid, and will now face new work requirements to get them.\n\nFor instance, the “One Big Beautiful Bill” includes a Medicaid work requirement that obligates able-bodied adults aged 19 to 64 to work at least 80 hours per month to remain eligible.\n\nFor many restaurant workers, this is simply not feasible. Not because of unwillingness, but because their hours depend on consumer demand.\n\nAccording to Harvard Kennedy School’s The Shift Project, which studies workplace trends, one in five service sector workers reported having not as many hours as they would like and saw a 34 percent fluctuation in the number of hours week to week.\n\n“I’m actually having a hard time at Chili’s because they went from giving me my full like four or five days a week, to now just one day a week. It really varies week to week,” Ordenana said.\n\n“When I ask for another day on the schedule [the manager] tells me, yeah, yeah sure. And then they don’t even put me on the schedule. So last week, I didn’t work at all,” Ordenana said.\n\nDemand for eating out has started to slump as Americans tighten purse strings in the face of a slowing economy and uncertainty over the impact of Trump’s tariffs.\n\nConsumer Price Index data showed that spending on eating out was flat for three months from February to April and has started to decline heading into the middle of the year.\n\nConsumer spending is projected to drop by 7 percent over the middle of the year, according to KPMG’s Consumer Pulse report.\n\nAs a result, One Fair Wage estimates that 45 percent of restaurant workers currently enrolled in Medicaid could lose their health insurance because of the possible downturn in hours because of slumping demand.\n\n“More tipped restaurant workers would lose their Medicaid than would gain small tax benefits. This is not the right solution,” Saru Jayaraman, founder of the advocacy group One Fair Wage told Al Jazeera.\n\n“Why are these workers on Medicaid to begin with? Because they earn a sub-minimum wage and can’t afford to take care of themselves.”\n\nSNAP benefits face a similar threat. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, forecasts that the tax bill could lead to as many as 11 million people, including restaurant workers, losing access to critical benefits. The House bill would cut $300bn from SNAP over the next 10 years and the Senate bill would cut $211bn.\n\n“Those cuts have to come out of benefits or eligibility. There is just no way that cuts to administrative costs, to streamline waste, fraud, and abuse, or whatever the talking points are about thinking. Those are benefits to eligible people. To achieve that kind of savings, you have to cut benefits to people. There’s no way around it. And that’s devastating,” Ed Bolen, director of SNAP State Strategies at Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, told Al Jazeera.\n\nNationwide, 18 percent of restaurant workers rely on SNAP benefits, including Ordenana.\n\n“How am I going to eat? How am I gonna survive? How am I going to pay rent? And then on top of that, I might lose benefits? How is this happening in America?” Ordenana asked rhetorically.","summary":"Restaurant workers say new work requirements don&#039;t account for the unstable hours inherent in food service.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/2/restaurant-workers-say-no-tax-on-tips-undermined-by-benefits-cuts?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP24344103835696-1751483675.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 20:08:14","author":"Andy Hirschfeld,Apps Support","authors":["Andy Hirschfeld","Apps Support"],"language":"en","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":337613302,"title":"James Carville tells ex-CNN host he's worried Trump will tamper with 2026 midterm elections","text":"Democratic strategist James Carville said in an interview this week that he’s \"very\" worried that President Donald Trump and his administration will cheat in the 2026 midterm elections.

Comedy Central has not yet given a reason for the delay. The merger that Stone and Parker pointed to is set to happen by July 6, Deadline.com reported Tuesday, with Skydance to acquire control of Paramount Global and merge both companies. With the merger, Skydance Media boss Jeff Shell is set to become the boss of the soon-to-be-joined companies.

So too have the chiefs of two major social media platforms — among the richest people on the planet.\n\nThe $16 million settlement over an interview CBS' 60 Minutes conducted last fall with then-Vice President Kamala Harris smooths the path for Redstone and Paramount to secure the approval of the Federal Communications Commission to sell the company to Skydance Media, a deal bankrolled by Oracle founder Larry Ellison, a Trump ally. The FCC must sign off on the transfer of the broadcast licenses for CBS' local TV stations for the deal to go through.\n\nTrump's legal team had alleged that CBS's decision last fall to air different parts of Harris's answer to a question about the Israel/Hamas conflict on 60 Minutes and Face The Nation constituted election interference. They said it had inflicted emotional harm on Trump. His pick to lead the FCC had initiated a formal review of complaints against CBS.\n\n\"With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit,\" a spokesperson for Trump's legal team said on Wednesday. \"CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle.\"\n\nOutside legal experts, by and large, see it differently. They almost uniformly call Trump's claims spurious, saying CBS's editorial decisions are protected by the First Amendment.\n\nGeorge Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, a frequent Trump defender, publicly argued that the lawsuit was likely unfounded.\n\n\"The decision to settle a case with no legal merit obviously comes squarely from the corporate suite, not from anybody at CBS News,\" former CBS News president Andrew Heyward tells NPR. \"To me, the critical issue is whether 60 Minutes can hold onto its tradition of fierce editorial integrity under new management.\"\n\nIndeed, CBS chief and Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks focused on the company's larger financial interests at a Paramount shareholders' meeting on Wednesday. \"Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial, as well as reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,\" Cheeks said. He noted that a legal settlement lets a company move on with its business.\n\nEmotions ran high at a 60 Minutes staff meeting Wednesday morning. A person who spoke on condition of anonymity in order to discuss internal company matters says people were more doleful than angry. The payout came as no surprise; corporate executives had telegraphed that there would certainly be a settlement. Some were relieved that Paramount had declined to issue what they saw as an unwarranted apology.\n\nTrump speaks about free speech but lawsuits serve as warning signal \n\nParamount and CBS are following what is — by now — a well worn path of corporate deference to Trump.\n\nThe owners of the Washington Post and the L.A. Times — the billionaire entrepreneurs Jeff Bezos and Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong — separately killed editorials drafted to endorse Harris shortly before the election and completely overhauled their editorial pages to be less likely to criticize Trump. Both men have significant business dealings before the Trump administration.\n\nThe Walt Disney Co., parent of ABC, promised to pay Trump's presidential foundation $15 million and $1 million in legal fees over anchor George Stephanopoulos's mischaracterization of legal proceedings against Trump. It also issued a note of regret.\n\nMeta paid even more — $25 million — to resolve a suit from Trump over his removal from Facebook after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Outside lawyers say it had an even stronger case than Disney.\n\nLast year, as he campaigned for the White House, Trump promised to protect free speech and end censorship. In March, in a presidential address to Congress, Trump said he had done just that.\n\nIn recent days, by contrast, Trump has threatened to sue CNN and the New York Times over their disclosure of preliminary intelligence reports suggesting the strikes on Iran were not as debilitating to its nuclear weapons program as the administration said. Neither has retreated from its reporting. On Tuesday, the administration also suggested it might prosecute CNN for reporting on an app that would alert users to activity by immigration authorities. CNN noted that any iPhone user can download it through the App Store.\n\nMeanwhile, the Des Moines Register's parent company, Gannett Co., is fighting litigation Trump brought in Iowa over a poll days before the election showing Harris with a lead in that state. Trump won handily. Even so, that does not make for a legal wrong, media lawyers and legal observers say.\n\n\"A cold wind just blew through every newsroom\"\n\nFree speech and press advocates blanketed Paramount with condemnation Wednesday for settling the 60 Minutes case.\n\n\"A cold wind just blew through every newsroom this morning,\" said Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression. \"Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media's editor-in-chief.\"\n\nJameel Jaffer, executive director of the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, said Paramount would have prevailed in any suit. He said the settlement marked a sad day for press freedoms.\n\n\"This was a frivolous lawsuit and the payment being described as a 'settlement' bears no relation to Paramount's actual legal exposure in the case, which was negligible,\" Jaffer said. \"Now Trump's presidential library will be a permanent monument to Paramount's surrender, a continual reminder of its failure to defend freedoms that are essential to our democracy.\"\n\nSome legal scholars have told NPR they consider the settlement a form of extortion, relying upon the president's powers and influence over the executive branch. \n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers have called for hearings or investigations. \"Paramount just paid Trump a bribe for merger approval,\" Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden posted on X. \"When Democrats retake power, I'll be first in line calling for federal charges. In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court, today.\"\n\nConvictions on bribery charges can be hard to secure and are often tossed out, says Charles Elson, the founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware. CBS simply had more to lose than Trump should the case have gone to court, he says, arguing that the legal discovery process could've turned up evidence that the media company would rather keep hidden.\n\n\"Every organization has someone within it that has said something that looks terrible to its reputation,\" he tells NPR.\n\nYet there is no reason to believe that legal settlements guarantee future peace with a president who has long identified \"fake news\" as the enemy.\n\nElon Musk's social media platform X, previously Twitter, agreed to pay $10 million to resolve its decision under prior ownership to kick Trump off after the January 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol. The two men recently tangled over the president's budget proposals; now Trump has raised the prospect of having the budget-slashing initiative that Musk led turn its attention to federal contracts and subsidies currently benefiting Musk's ventures.","summary":"With a $16 million payment to settle President Trump's lawsuit over 60 Minutes' interview with Kamala Harris, CBS becomes the latest media outlet to bow to his power.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2025/07/02/nx-s1-5454790/cbs-settlement-trump-60-minutes-harris-interview-analysis","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/7349x4902+0+0/resize/7349x4902!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd3%2F7c%2Fd1965c8e464b99fbe6f54ceeadad%2Fgettyimages-1244207250.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 19:48:49","author":"David Folkenflik","authors":["David Folkenflik"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.184},{"id":337603206,"title":"Paramount to pay $16 million in settlement with Donald Trump over “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris","text":"Paramount Global, the parent company of CBS News, has agreed to pay $16 million to settle a legal dispute with President Donald Trump over the editing of a 60 Minutes interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris last October.\n\n The decision comes as a striking concession in a case that has been seen as a threat to bedrock American principles of free speech.\n\n In a statement provided to Entertainment Weekly on Wednesday, Paramount said the money would go to Trump's legal fees and costs, as well as his future presidential library, not to the Republican president himself. The company also said the settlement didn't involve an apology or expression of regret.\n\n A spokesperson for Trump's legal team called the settlement a \"win for the American people.\"\n\n Harris' 60 Minutes interview drew attention when some observers noted that CBS News showed the sitting VP and presidential candidate giving different responses to a question posed by correspondent Bill Whitaker in clips that were aired on Face the Nation on Oct. 6 and the next night on 60 Minutes. The network said each clip came from one lengthy response by Harris that was edited to fit time constraints on both broadcasts.\n\n Trump, who turned down a request to be interviewed by 60 Minutes during the 2024 presidential campaign, filed a lawsuit in Texas on Nov. 1, seeking $10 billion and alleging that CBS had deceptively edited the interview with to \"tip the scales [of the election] in favor of the Democratic party.\"\n\n CBS subsequently said the case was \"completely without merit\" and asked a judge to dismiss it, while also engaging in settlement negotiations. In February, CBS released the transcript of the interview, which showed that Harris gave a lengthy answer to a question about Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister.\n\n Many legal experts have said Trump's case was baseless, and that CBS was protected by the First Amendment.\n\n Meanwhile, Paramount has been trying to complete a lucrative merger with Skydance Media for several months, and with the deal requiring approval from the Trump administration, in part because CBS owns local stations that are licensed by the government, speculation has swirled that this may have put more pressure on the company to pay up.\n\n Paramount has maintained that the Trump case is \"completely separate from, and unrelated to\" the Skydance merger.\n\n In a statement posted to social media, the Writers Guild of America East, which represents 60 Minutes' writers, said the settlement was a \"transparent attempt to curry favors with an administration in the hopes it will allow Paramount Global and Skydance Media merger to be cleared. Paramount's decision to capitulate to Trump threatens journalists' ability to do their job reporting on powerful public figures.\"\n\n Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts also called for an investigation into the settlement and vowed to introduce legislation to \"rein in corruption\" via donations to presidential libraries.\n\n \"With Paramount folding to Donald Trump at the same time the company needs his administration's approval for its billion-dollar merger, this could be bribery in plain sight,\" Warren said in a statement, according to Deadline Hollywood. \"Paramount has refused to provide answers to a congressional inquiry, so I'm calling for a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken.\"\n\n Warren added, \"This settlement exposes a glaring need for rules to restrict donations to sitting presidents' libraries. I will soon introduce new legislation to rein in corruption through presidential library donations. The Trump administration's level of sheer corruption is appalling and Paramount should be ashamed of putting its profits over independent journalism.\"\n\n Want more movie news?

However the network and some groups have said it is normal editing common in television interviews.\n\nCBS previously said the lawsuit was \"completely without merit\" and asked a judge to dismiss the case.\n\nIn a statement, Paramount said the million-dollar settlement would allocated to Mr Trump's future presidential library.\n\nCalls for bribery investigation\n\nThe settlement comes as Paramount seeks approval from the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for its $US8.4 billion merger with Skydance Media.\n\nDemocrat Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren has called for a bribery investigation.\n\n\"With Paramount folding to Donald Trump at the same time the company needs his administration's approval for its billion-dollar merger, this could be bribery in plain sight,\" she said.\n\n\"Paramount has refused to provide answers to a congressional inquiry, so I'm calling for a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken.\"\n\nOn the campaign trail last year, and as president, Mr Trump has called for CBS's broadcasting licences to be revoked.\n\nThe FCC, an independent federal agency, issues eight-year licences to individual broadcast stations, not networks.\n\nFCC commissioner Anna Gomez, a Democrat, said the settlement over an entirely \"meritless\" lawsuit was a \"desperate\" move by Paramount that \"casts a long shadow over the integrity of the transaction pending before the FCC\" and \"marks a dangerous precedent for the First Amendment\".\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders said: \"Paramount's decision will only embolden Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media which he has labelled 'the enemy of the people'.\"\n\nMr Trump's legal team welcomed the settlement on Wednesday.\n\n\"With this record settlement, President Donald J.

The proposed settlement, which did not include an apology from Paramount, will be allocated to Trump's future presidential library, the company said.Paramount is awaiting government approval of its planned merger with David Ellison's Skydance Media. The company said the settlement was \"completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction.\"Paramount said companies often settle lawsuits to avoid costly, unpredictable legal battles, potential reputational or financial harm, and business disruptions, and move forward without prolonged uncertainty.A spokesperson for Trump's legal team called the settlement \"another win for the American people.\"\"CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle,\" the spokesperson said. (You can find the full statements from Paramount and the Trump team at the end of this story.)Here's what big names in media and politics have been saying in reaction to the Paramount-Trump settlement news:\"It's a shakedown, isn't it — it's on [Paramount controlling owner] Shari Redstone's neck. She can't close the deal without it. It's a tragedy that something as important and serious and meaningful as CBS News is sort of being traded away for this shakedown.\"I'd like to think [former Washington Post publisher] Katharine Graham wouldn't have done it. We don't know anything about [David] Ellison. He might be a terrific supporter of newsgathering, but one has become pessimistic with these issues.\"\"With Paramount folding to Donald Trump at the same time the company needs his administration's approval for its billion-dollar merger, this could be bribery in plain sight. Paramount has refused to provide answers to a congressional inquiry, so I'm calling for a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken.\"This settlement exposes a glaring need for rules to restrict donations to sitting presidents' libraries. I will soon introduce new legislation to rein in corruption through presidential library donations. The Trump administration's level of sheer corruption is appalling and Paramount should be ashamed of putting its profits over independent journalism.\"\"Assuming the merger gets approved, the bigger issue will be the posture of new owners toward '60 Minutes' and really all of CBS News. I would hope for respect for the network's heritage, as well as a pledge of journalistic independence and proof that they will honor it. The early indicators aren't all that encouraging.\"\"Paramount's decision to settle a meritless lawsuit rather than stand behind its journalists at CBS News is a spineless capitulation.\"This was a moment to defend press freedom and support reporters targeted by a frivolous legal attack. Instead, Paramount chose appeasement to bolster its finances, sending a dangerous message that media outlets can be pressured into submission if corporate parents find their profits at risk from government action in unrelated areas.\"With two major network owners bowing to the president in quick succession, the danger is clear: emboldened politicians and powerful actors will feel more free than ever to weaponize lawsuits and bring regulatory pressure to bear to silence and censor independent journalism.\"\"Now with the lawsuit settled, we believe the FCC is poised to approve the PARA/Skydance deal, and we feel the deal can close within a couple of weeks after FCC approval.\"Our expectation has been a closing (with no material changes to terms) after 1H25 but still in the summer, and we feel that continues to be the case. We think companies, and especially CFOs, like to close deals on the first day of a month (with the first day of a quarter even more preferred, but missed 7/1 in this case). And we expect PARA to be ready to close this chapter of its story soon.\"\"This is the deal we thought we'd see back in January: A Trump-friendly media mogul agrees to pay him millions of dollars, so she can sell her company to a Trump-backing tech mogul.\"On the one hand, you can squint and argue that Paramount is a winner here because it didn't have to give up more — like a public apology for something it didn't do. All it had to do is fork over the now-standard payment for media and tech companies that want to operate in Trump 2.0.\"On the other hand: These corporate payoffs to the president of the United States should be shocking. My worry is that we're just a few months into this, and we've already accepted them as normal.\"\"This is a shameful decision by Paramount. Shari Redstone and Paramount's board should have stood by CBS journalists and the integrity of press freedom. Instead, they chose to reward Donald Trump for his petty legal assault against both. A line is being drawn between the owners of American news media who are willing to stand up for press freedom and those who capitulate to the demands of the president.\"Today, Paramount's leaders chose to be on the wrong side of that dividing line, but they'd be mistaken to believe appeasing Trump today will stop his attacks in the future. News media owners are much better off standing strong than acquiescing.\"\"Will this encourage politicians and others to file bogus lawsuits [a]s a way of intimidating news organizations and their corporate boards? Will the correspondents and producers of \"60 Minutes\" see this as a corporate betrayal of the program in service to a multi billion dollar merger? (Answers to both questions: YES.)\"\"The decision by the Redstone family, the major owners of Paramount, to settle a bogus lawsuit with President Trump over a 60 Minutes report he did not like is an extremely dangerous precedent in terms of both the first amendment and government extortion.\"Paramount's decision will only embolden Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media which he has labeled 'the enemy of the people.' It is a dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press - an essential part of our democracy. It is a victory for a president who is attempting to stifle dissent and undermine American democracy.\"It's pretty obvious why Paramount chose to surrender to Trump. The Redstone family is in line to receive $2.4 billion from the sale of Paramount to Skydance, but they can only receive this money if the Trump administration approves this deal. In other words, the Redstone family diminished the freedom of the press today in exchange for a $2.4 billion payday.\"Make no mistake about it. Trump is undermining our democracy and rapidly moving us towards authoritarianism and the billionaires who care more about their stock portfolios than our democracy are helping him do it. That is beyond unacceptable.\"\"The fact there was no apology was good, and it makes sense in the grand scheme of things in what they have to do. It's pretty hard to escape the idea that it's political. The Ellisons stayed away from any political statement during the whole process — now we'll see what they do. And there's obviously a job open at CBS News they'll have to fill.\"\"This settlement is a cowardly capitulation by the corporate leaders of Paramount, and a fundamental betrayal of '60 Minutes' and CBS News. The story that was the subject of this lawsuit was edited by the book and in accordance with CBS News standards. Our corporate bosses know that; they know that this lawsuit is completely baseless. But they settled it in order to preserve Shari Redstone's payday. That is shameful.\"\"It's hard to say which is worse: the craven surrender by a media company that did nothing wrong, the betrayal of one of our finest news outlets, or the lawless extortion by the President of the United States. that it all happened in broad daylight is an appalling measure of the damage Trump has inflicted.\"Here's Paramount Global's statement: \"Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction.\"And here's Trump's legal team's: \"With this record settlement, President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit. CBS and Paramount Global realized the strength of this historic case and had no choice but to settle. President Trump will always ensure that no one gets away with lying to the American People as he continues on his singular mission to Make America Great Again.\"","summary":"Media and political insiders react to Paramount's settlement with Trump, questioning its potential impacts on the Skydance merger and press freedom.","url":"https://www.businessinsider.com/paramount-trump-settlement-media-politics-reactions-2025-7","image":"https://i.insider.com/686557ab3d5881a51c1c8b4b?width=1200&format=jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 19:11:04","author":"Lara O'reilly,Lucia Moses","authors":["Lara O'reilly","Lucia Moses"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.642},{"id":337600728,"title":"Rachel Brosnahan stuns in a glittering cut-out red dress as her co-star David Corenswet sweetly kisses her hand at Superman fan event in London","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jul 2nd 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\n'I'm under so much pressure': What Rachel Reeves said before mystery tears as markets tumble and No10 frantically denies Starmer bust-up\n\nDiddy's jubilant mom and kids break silence on shock verdict as Cassie holes up at NYC home\n\nMarried head of Royal Navy sacked after inquiry into affair with female colleague\n\nDAN HODGES: What one Cabinet minister has told me about what REALLY lies behind Reeves's public breakdown, the truth about Angela Rayner's role - and why it all means the Chancellor cannot remain in post any longer\n\nTruth about Anna Wintour's shock Vogue departure: Insiders whisper to TOM LEONARD of 'only person who could have shown her the door' and tell of quaking staff's REAL reaction to bombshell\n\nBryan Kohberger breaks his silence and confesses to the four Idaho murders: Live updates\n\nKate Middleton opens up about her 'really difficult' cancer recovery as she meets with hospital patients and says 'you're not able to function normally'\n\nThe astonishing behind-the-scenes details on Israel's campaign of sabotage and assassination against Iran, the gadget-loving spy chief masterminding it all and what I've been told about Mossad's bold plan for Tehran's future\n\nWe loved boozy dinners, cocktails and champagne.

Compared to that risible claim, the amount that Paramount has agreed to pay—$16 million for legal expenses and a contribution to Trump's presidential library—is pretty puny. It is also less than the $25 million that Trump reportedly demanded during negotiations with Paramount. It is nevertheless $16 million more than Trump deserved based on claims that CBS had accurately described as \"completely without merit.\"\n\nThis humiliating settlement starkly illustrates how the powers of the presidency can be abused to punish news outlets for constitutionally protected speech. It does not bode well for freedom of the press under a president who has no compunction about weaponizing the government against journalists who irk him.\n\n\"A cold wind just blew through every newsroom this morning,\" Robert Corne-Revere, chief counsel at the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, said in an emailed statement. \"Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media's editor-in-chief.\"\n\nAlthough CBS initially said it would \"vigorously defend\" against Trump's lawsuit, Shari Redstone, Paramount's controlling shareholder, decided that the company's business interests would be better served by throwing in the towel. Redstone, The New York Times notes, \"has said she wants to avoid a protracted legal war with the president that could cost hundreds of millions of dollars and jeopardize other divisions that have business with the government.\"\n\nAnother possible consideration was Paramount's pending merger with Skydance Media, which is subject to approval by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) because it entails the transfer of broadcast licenses. \"Some executives at the company viewed the president's lawsuit as a potential hurdle\" to that multibillion-dollar deal, the Times reports, although both Paramount and Brendan Carr, the FCC's Trump-appointed chairman, have insisted that the president's phony grievance against CBS \"was not linked to the F.C.C.'s review of the company's merger with Skydance.\" That is hard to believe, especially since Carr decided to reopen a \"broadcast news distortion\" investigation of CBS based on the same pre-election interview that Trump claimed had cost him more than his net worth.\n\nTrump's beef with CBS News focused on Harris' answer to a question about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. When 60 Minutes correspondent Bill Whitaker suggested that Netanyahu was \"not listening\" to the Biden administration's concerns about the war in Gaza and had \"rebuffed just about all of your administration's entreaties,\" here is how Harris responded:\n\nWell, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. And we're not going to stop doing that. We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.\n\nOn October 6, Face the Nation promoted the Harris interview with a clip that included the first sentence. The interview as aired on 60 Minutes the following day used the last sentence. In other words, the latter show's producers were telling the truth when they said they had used the \"same question\" and the \"same answer\" but \"a different portion of the response.\" By contrast, Trump was flat-out lying when he claimed CBS \"100% removed Kamala's horrible election changing answers to questions\" and \"replaced them with completely different, and far better, answers, taken from another part of the interview.\"\n\nHarris did not come across as especially forthright, articulate, or intelligent in either version, although the one that 60 Minutes showed was a bit more concise. But as Trump saw it, the decision to use the last sentence instead of the first one amounted to \"Election Interference.\" It was an \"UNPRECEDENTED SCANDAL\" and \"a giant Fake News Scam\" that was \"totally illegal.\" By editing the interview to make Harris \"look better,\" he said, CBS had committed an offense so egregious that the FCC should \"TAKE AWAY THE CBS LICENSE\"—by which he presumably meant the broadcast licenses held by CBS-owned stations.\n\nCBS still has its licenses (for now). But in a lawsuit that Trump filed on October 31 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, he argued that making Harris seem slightly more cogent was \"totally illegal\" because it violated that state's Deceptive Trade Practices Act (DTPA). That violation, he averred, had cost him \"at least\" $10 billion in Texas alone. A footnote claimed that \"CBS's distortion of the 60 Minutes Interview damaged President Trump's fundraising and support values by several billions of dollars, particularly in Texas\"—a completely unsupported assertion that, even if taken at face value, would not come close to justifying Trump's estimate of damages within Texas.\n\nIn case that was not ridiculous enough, an amended complaint that Trump filed on February 7, a few weeks after taking office, doubled his estimate of the damages inflicted by CBS. The revised complaint added a claim under Section 43(a)(1)(B) of the federal Lanham Act, which applies when someone \"misrepresents the nature, characteristics, qualities, or geographic origin of his or her or another person's goods, services, or commercial activities.\" By violating that provision, Trump asserted, CBS had cost him an amount \"reasonably believed to be no less than $10,000,000,000.\"\n\nThis time, Trump's lawyers did not even bother adding a footnote. Nor did they explain why his estimate of Lanham Act damages throughout the United States was exactly the same as his estimate of DTPA damages within Texas—a weird coincidence that made little sense even if you ignored the comical magnitude of the numbers. And those flagrantly fictional figures were by no means the only absurd aspect of Trump's case.\n\nThe DTPA prohibits \"false, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any trade or commerce.\" As relevant here, the DTPA defines \"trade or commerce\" as \"the advertising, offering for sale, sale, lease, or distribution of any good or service,\" including \"any trade or commerce directly or indirectly affecting the people of this state.\" In other words, the statute is aimed at misrepresentations in connection with the promotion or sale of goods or services.\n\nWhen it edited the Harris interview, 60 Minutes was not advertising or selling anything. It was practicing journalism—poorly, in Trump's view, but in any case making the sort of editorial decisions that news outlets routinely make. Those decisions are indisputably protected by the First Amendment except in specific, narrow circumstances such as defamation. Whatever you make of Trump's objections to the Harris interview, they plainly do not support a claim for damages under the DTPA.\n\nTrump claimed his lawsuit was authorized by Section 17.50 of the DTPA, which says \"a consumer may maintain an action\" when he suffers \"economic damages\" or \"mental anguish\" as a result of false, misleading, or deceptive statements that he \"relied on\" to his \"detriment.\" A consumer also can sue based on \"breach of an express or implied warranty\" or \"any unconscionable action.\" The law defines that last phrase as \"an act or practice which, to a consumer's detriment, takes advantage of the lack of knowledge, ability, experience, or capacity of the consumer to a grossly unfair degree.\"\n\nTrump's lawsuit said he was \"a 'consumer' within the meaning of the DTPA, since he is an individual who sought and received CBS's broadcast services.\" But the statute defines \"consumer\" as someone who \"seeks or acquires by purchase or lease, any goods or services\" (emphasis added). Trump did not purchase or lease anything from CBS.\n\nWhile Trump may be a \"consumer\" of 60 Minutes in the sense that he watches the show, he is not a consumer who bought goods or services from CBS, let alone one who bought goods or services based on \"false, misleading, or deceptive acts or practices.\" Since there was no transaction, Trump likewise could not have suffered damages by buying something based on \"an express or implied warranty\" or because he lacked the \"knowledge, ability, experience, or capacity\" to assess the merits of the purchase.\n\nTrump's lawsuit noted that the DTPA covers practices that \"caus[e] confusion or misunderstanding\" regarding \"the source, sponsorship, approval, or certification of goods or services\" or regarding \"affiliation, connection, or association with, or certification, by another.\" He said CBS confused \"millions of Americans, and in particular residents of Texas,\" because it was \"impossible for even the most discerning viewers to determine whether the 60 Minutes interview was independent journalism or de facto advertising for the Kamala Campaign.\" He said viewers also would have been confused about \"the Interview's 'certification by' CBS given its legal obligation to broadcast news in a non-distortive manner.\"\n\nThe lawsuit added that \"CBS's misconduct was unconscionable because it amounts to a brazen attempt to interfere in the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election.\" That understanding of \"unconscionable,\" invoking supposed election interference, has nothing to do with the way the term is used in the statute, where it refers to a situation in which a business cheats a consumer by taking advantage of his ignorance in a \"grossly unfair\" way.\n\nNone of this makes any sense in the context of the DTPA, because none of it is grounded in a commercial relationship between Trump and CBS. Trump was simply dressing up his criticism of news coverage as a consumer fraud complaint without any evidence that CBS engaged in the deceptive trade practices that the law covers. This is the same strategy he later used in his lawsuit against The Des Moines Register, which offended him by publishing a poll that inaccurately predicted a Harris victory in Iowa. If misleading journalism counted as actionable consumer fraud, news outlets would have to constantly worry about potentially ruinous litigation whenever their work might be characterized that way, which is almost always the case.\n\nTrump's Lanham Act claim was equally groundless. That law, his amended complaint said, \"was designed to protect against duplicitous conduct by industry participants (such as Defendants) that results in unfair competition.\" The complaint averred that Trump was competing with CBS because he \"creates and produces digital media content about news, politics, pop culture, and public affairs, some of it for commercial and entertainment purposes, and much of which he disseminates in his personal capacity and through his media brands including Truth Social,\" his social media platform. It added that CBS had unfairly competed with Trump by editing and promoting the Harris interview in a way that gave viewers a false impression of its content.\n\nAs CBS noted, Trump failed to \"plausibly allege even the foundation of the claim: that CBS' news programming is 'commercial advertising or promotion.'\" It added that the Lanham Act and the DTPA \"do not and could not, consistent with the First Amendment, apply to editorial speech like the broadcasts at issue\" in this case: \"If the First Amendment means anything, it means that public officials like Plaintiffs cannot hold news organizations like CBS liable for the simple exercise of editorial judgment.\"\n\nYet that is what Trump tried to do. Did he succeed? Paramount did not concede that CBS News had committed any journalistic sins, let alone that it had violated patently inapplicable state and federal laws. Nor did Paramount issue any sort of apology. But according to the Times, the company did agree to \"release written transcripts of future '60 Minutes' interviews with presidential candidates.\"\n\nWhile that concession in itself may seem unobjectionable or even welcome, a payment of any sort vindicates Trump's strategy of combining frivolous litigation with implicit threats of adverse official action to intimidate news organizations. Paramount is essentially paying Trump protection money—a characterization plausible enough that, according to the Times, \"the prospect of being accused of bribery, and perhaps facing legal action because of it, had vexed Paramount's directors.\" And even before the settlement, the Times reports, Paramount and CBS executives had begun applying \"more scrutiny than usual\" to 60 Minutes segments that \"could be construed as critical of the Trump administration.\"\n\nTrump's lawyers presented his extortion—which was motivated, like many things Trump does, by a petty personal peeve—as a victory for all of us. \"With this record settlement,\" they crowed, \"President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit.

This brings to a close the lawsuit filed by Trump and his campaign late last year, which accused CBS News of “deceitful” editing during a 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President and then-Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\nThe settlement was agreed to on Tuesday by the two parties, as well as Texas Representative Ronny Jackson, in the Northern District of Texas court.\n\nAs part of the settlement, CBS News will issue no statement of apology or regret for the 60 Minutes interview with Harris.\n\nAdditionally, the network has agreed to release transcripts of interviews with eligible U.S. presidential candidates after the interviews have aired, with the ability to add redactions for legal or national security concerns.\n\nThe majority of the $16 million settlement will go towards Trump’s future presidential library. This agreement is similar to ABC News’ when it settled a defamation suit with the president for $15 million in December. The remaining funds will be used to cover litigation costs.\n\nNeither Trump nor Jackson will receive any settlement amounts, either directly or indirectly, and all claims against CBS News will be dropped, including the Texas action and the threatened defamation action.\n\nNews of an impending settlement started circulating on Monday after a court filing indicated the parties were “engaged in good faith, advanced, settlement negotiations.” \n\nReactions to the settlement have been pouring in from all corners.\n\nAccording to Variety, Paramount co-CEO George Cheeks addressed the settlement during the company’s 2025 annual shareholder meeting, saying, “Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable cost of legal defense,” as well as to avoid “reputational damage.” \n\nCheeks added, “Settlement offers a negotiated resolution to allow companies to focus on their core objectives.” \n\nSemafor’s Max Tani reports that CBS News president Tom Cibrowski told his staff on Wednesday morning that the matter was now “behind us.”\n\n I’m told the settlement was addressed on today’s morning staff call by network president Tom Cibrowski, who largely reiterated what was in the press release, but told staff the matter was now “behind us.” — max tani (@maxtani.bsky.social) July 2, 2025 at 9:34 AM\n\nWhile a staffer at CBS News told CNN’s Brian Stelter, “This is a very sad moment for 60 Minutes, CBS News, and journalism.”\n\nThe Writers Guild of America East, which represents journalists at CBS News, including those at 60 Minutes, released a statement on Wednesday, saying it stood behind its 60 Minutes and CBS News members and had hoped that Paramount Global’s management would do the same.\n\nThe statement added, “This settlement is a transparent attempt to curry favors with an administration in the hopes it will allow Paramount Global and Skydance Media merger to be cleared for approval. Paramount’s decision to capitulate to Trump threatens journalists’ ability to do their job reporting on powerful public figures.” \n\n The following is a statement from the Writers Guild of America East regarding Paramount’s settlement with Donald Trump over a “60 Minutes” segment: — Writers Guild of America East (@wgaeast.bsky.social) July 2, 2025 at 8:21 AM\n\nSettling the case was reportedly a top priority for Paramount Global chair Shari Redstone as she seeks to complete a long-anticipated sale to Skydance Media. That company is run by David Ellison, whose father, Larry Ellison, backed Trump during his re-election campaign.\n\nParamount Global, in its settlement statement, said, “This lawsuit is completely separate from, and unrelated to, the Skydance transaction and the FCC approval process. We will abide by the legal process to defend our case.”\n\nThe pathway to reaching a settlement came with enormous consequences for CBS News, as it lost two key executives, including Wendy McMahon, president and CEO of CBS News and Stations and CBS Media Ventures, and Bill Owens, the longtime executive producer of 60 Minutes.","summary":"Paramount Global and Donald Trump Settle for $16 Million","url":"https://www.adweek.com/tvnewser/paramount-global-and-donald-trump-settle-for-16-million/","image":"https://static-www.adweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Paramount-Global-Paramount.jpg?w=600&h=315&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 19:04:16","author":"Mark Mwachiro","authors":["Mark Mwachiro"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.405},{"id":337595008,"title":"Do Voter Restrictions Really Harm Democrats in Elections? What Studies Show","text":"Conventional political wisdom holds that Democrats typically benefit from high voter turnout and are harmed by voter restrictions, but recent presidential election data may challenge this view.Why It MattersMany political observers viewed the 2024 election as a historical realignment, with Republican President Donald Trump gaining ground with voter groups that historically leaned toward Democrats, such as Latino voters and young voters, groups who Democrats have for decades argued could be disenfranchised by harsher voting restrictions.Now, some are questioning whether voting restrictions really harm Democrats, having potential implications for future elections.What To KnowThe Pew Research Center last week unveiled new data on the 2024 election, showing that if every eligible American voted, Trump would still have defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.In fact, nonvoters preferred Trump by a four-point margin (44 percent to 40 percent), a major shift from 2020, when nonvoters preferred former President Joe Biden by an 11-point margin over Trump (46 percent to 35 percent), according to Pew.This raises questions about the long-standing view that Democrats benefit from high-turnout elections and that lower-propensity voters are more likely to favor Democrats.MSNBC columnist and newsletter editor Ryan Teague Beckwith wrote in an opinion article published Wednesday that the data \"disproves Democrats' most cherished delusion,\" referring to the belief that voter restrictions harm Democrats.\"Donald Trump won that election by 1.5 percentage points, but any Democrat who muttered that new restrictions on voting in red states skewed the result has to contend with this study, which involved surveying 9,000 voters after the election and then painstakingly verifying which ones actually voted — and which didn't,\" Beckwith wrote.Jacob Neiheisel, an associate professor in the Department of Political Science at the University at Buffalo, told Newsweek that there is \"very little evidence that voter ID laws decrease turnout on average,\" as Democrats use their existence to mobilize voters.However, shifting voter coalitions could \"absolutely\" influence the \"partisan effects of different election reforms in the near future,\" he said.\"Democrats used to be a low-propensity group in terms of turnout. The Democratic coalition has grown more educated in the Trump era, however, meaning that the Republicans will (or soon will be) the partisan coalition that consists of more marginal supporters,\" he said.The relationship between turnout and partisanship has long been \"complicated,\" and that expanding voter access seems to be a \" really blunt instrument for changing a party's electoral fortunes,\" Neiheisel said.Voter ID remains broadly popular among voters across the political spectrum. A Gallup poll from October 2024 found that 84 percent of Americans support requiring voters to provide a photo ID at their voting place in order to vote. Even 67 percent of Democrats supported he measure.Other Studies Show Little Effect From Voter Access and ID LawsA 2023 study titled \"Who benefits from voter identification laws?\" written by Jeffrey Harden and Alejandra Campos found \"negligible average effects\" in terms of which party benefits from voter ID laws, as the laws caused mobilization among both parties, \"ultimately mitigating their anticipated effects on election results.\"That study was published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.Studies conducted after the 2020 presidential race dispelled the idea that measures aimed at making it easier to vote by mail or absentee during the COVID-19 pandemic benefited Democrats.A regression analysis from the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia concluded that the increase in absentee voting that year \"did not favor Joe Biden's candidacy.\" Absentee voting had \"no effect at all on 2020 Democratic vote margin\" after controlling for the 2016 Democratic vote margin, wrote author Alan I. Abramowitz.\"These findings suggest that efforts by Republican legislators in a number of states to roll back eased absentee voting rules and make it more difficult for voters to take advantage of absentee voting in the future are unlikely to benefit GOP candidates,\" Abramowitz wrote. \"Not only is there no evidence that absentee voting leads to widespread fraud, there is also no evidence that it favors Democratic candidates.\"A separate study titled \"Vote-by-Mail Policy and the 2020 Presidential Election,\" authored by Eric McGhee and Mindy Romero, also found that vote-by-mail has no \"robust partisan effect,\" and that some models suggest Republicans might get a slight advantage from these policies.What People Are SayingNew York Times political analyst Nate Cohn wrote in a report: \"For a generation, the assumption that Democrats benefit from high turnout has underpinned the hopes and machinations of both parties, from Republican support for restrictive voting laws to Democratic hopes of mobilizing a new progressive coalition of young and nonwhite voters.\"It's not clear whether Democrats will struggle with irregular voters in the future, but the data nonetheless essentially ends the debate about whether Ms. Harris lost because she alienated swing voters or because she failed to energize her base. In the end, Democrats alienated voters whose longtime support they might have taken for granted.\"Elections expert G. Elliott Morris, in an April Substack post: \"Obviously, the less reliable coalition Republicans are leaning on now can still work out for a party when leaders are willing to quickly make huge changes to public policy and otherwise wield political power in unprecedented ways. As a corollary, it's harder for Democrats to win higher-profile contests and rarer, then, to wield that power. But only winning races when (a) broader conditions are in your favor and (b) you can activate your hard-to-reach supporters is not a good strategy for establishing a broad base of power.\"What Happens NextPartisan coalitions are constantly evolving in politics, so it remains to be seen whether these findings will hold up in future elections.","summary":"A political scientist told Newsweek that shifting coalitions could influence \"partisan effects of different election reforms.\"","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/do-voter-restrictions-harm-democrats-elections-2093845","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2675866/voters-cast-ballots-early-2024-election.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 19:02:39","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.384},{"id":337600514,"title":"Bernie Sanders blasts Paramount, says lawsuit settlement will further embolden Trump to attack media","text":"Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., blasted Paramount Global on Wednesday for settling President Donald Trump’s \"election interference\" lawsuit against CBS over the network’s handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. Sanders previously urged Paramount controlling shareholder Shari Redstone not to settle the lawsuit he called an \"attack on the First Amendment\" but to no avail. The company agreed to an eight-figure payment and changes to its editorial policy on Tuesday night in what media critics called a shameful capitulation. \"The decision by the Redstone family, the major owners of Paramount, to settle a bogus lawsuit with President Trump over a 60 Minutes report he did not like is an extremely dangerous precedent in terms of both the First Amendment and government extortion,\" Sanders said to begin his scathing statement. PARAMOUNT, CBS FORCED TO PAY EIGHT FIGURES, CHANGE EDITORIAL POLICY IN SETTLEMENT WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP \"Paramount’s decision will only embolden Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media which he has labeled ‘the enemy of the people.’ It is a dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press — an essential part of our democracy,\" Sanders continued. \"It is a victory for a president who is attempting to stifle dissent and undermine American democracy. Trump will receive $16 million upfront. This will cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes, to be determined at Trump’s discretion. There is an anticipation that there will be another allocation in the mid-eight figures set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future, Fox News Digital has learned. Current Paramount management disputes the additional allocation, but a long-planned merger with Skydance Media is set to put new leadership in place. '60 MINUTES' KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT CENTER OF TRUMP LAWSUIT RUNS AFOUL OF CRONKITE-ERA CBS GUIDELINES \"It’s pretty obvious why Paramount chose to surrender to Trump. The Redstone family is in line to receive $2.4 billion from the sale of Paramount to Skydance, but they can only receive this money if the Trump administration approves this deal. In other words, the Redstone family diminished the freedom of the press today in exchange for a $2.4 billion payday,\" Sanders added. \"Make no mistake about it. Trump is undermining our democracy and rapidly moving us towards authoritarianism and the billionaires who care more about their stock portfolios than our democracy are helping him do it,\" Sanders added. \"That is beyond unacceptable.\" A source familiar with Paramount’s current leadership told Fox News Digital that only the initial $16 million was sanctioned by the official mediator, and they had no knowledge of any deal Trump may have made with incoming ownership. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., also took to X to accuse Paramount of taking a \"bribe\" and threatened future federal charges. \"Paramount just paid Trump a bribe for merger approval. When Democrats retake power, I’ll be first in line calling for federal charges. In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court, today,\" Wyden posted. Paramount insisted it was business as usual when asked about statements made by Sanders and Wyden. \"Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause. Settlement offers a negotiated resolution that allows companies to focus on their core objectives rather than being mired in uncertainty and distraction,\" a Paramount spokesperson told Fox News Digital. A source close to Trump mocked the liberal lawmakers. \"The socialists of the Democrat Party, like Sanders and Wyden, have rarely seen a business transaction where they didn’t want a full government intervention. President Trump is running circles around them and all they do is cry,\" the source told Fox News Digital.

Email: poppy.gibson@mailonline.co.uk \nBy POPPY ATKINSON GIBSON \n Published:19:55 BST, 2 July 2025 |Updated:19:56 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nA husband who tried to murder his wife with a bow and arrow before attacking her with a kitchen knife has been jailed for 17 years. \nStephen Carr, 57, was found guilty of attempted murder at their home in Strensall, York after the frenzied attack which left his partner Lorna Carr with horrific injuries. \nHis wife pleaded for her life and was stabbed six times while she made a 999 call to North Yorkshire Police on 8 September 2024 asking for urgent help.\nCCTV from inside Carr's own home captured the violent assault and video footage showed him attacking his wife first with a compound bow and then with a kitchen knife.\nDuring the vicious bombardment, he stood over her and said: 'You are dying tonight.'\nThe defenceless victim attempted to escape her husband by closing a door when she saw him drawing his bow, which he then fired at the door with his wife standing behind it.\nFearing further violence, the terrified wife managed to find a number of arrows and break them to prevent him using them on her.\nAfter chasing her round the family home with the bow and arrows, he followed her into their bedroom where his wife had fled.\n\nStephen Carr, 57, (pictured) was found guilty of attempted murder at their home in Strensall, York after chasing his wife Lorna Carr around their family home with a bow and arrow\n\nCCTV from inside Carr's own home captured the violent assault and video footage showed him attacking his wife first with a compound bow and then with a kitchen knife\n\nThe defenceless victim attempted to escape her husband by closing a door when she saw him drawing his bow, which he then fired at the door with his wife standing behind it (Pictured: a bolt through a door)\nWhile she hid under the duvet on their bed Carr fired three shots with unbroken arrows that he managed to find.\nAt this point, the victim had managed to use her phone to call 999, and told police: 'He's got a bow, he's got a compound bow… DON'T KILL ME STEVE PLEASE. DO NOT KILL ME YOU C**T. PLEASE! THINK OF YOUR MUM'.\nAs she desperately pleaded for help from emergency services, Carr took a kitchen knife and plunged it six times into the back of his wife while she laid in a foetal position on the floor. \nThe victim screamed to the police call taker, telling them what had happened and asking for urgent help.\nHe then retreated to his garden shed, where he was later discovered by police.\nAfter the brutal assault Carr sent a WhatsApp message to his wife in which he said: 'I'm glad I didn't do what I wanted to do. I did say you were pushing me to far [sic]. My bag [sic] sorry.'\nThe victim was treated at the scene by attending police officers, before paramedics took her to Leeds General Infirmary where she had surgery. She spent a number of days in hospital before she was sent home.\nDetectives from North Yorkshire Police's Major Investigation Team led an extensive investigation and when Carr was interviewed he failed to provide any account for the sustained and repeated attack on his defenceless wife.\nCarr, who had been remanded in custody since his arrest, pleaded guilty to the alternative offence of causing grievous bodily harm but denied attempted murder.\n\nAfter the brutal assault Carr (pictured) sent a WhatsApp message to his wife in which he said: 'I'm glad I didn't do what I wanted to do. I did say you were pushing me to far [sic]. My bag [sic] sorry.'\n\nAt his trial, Carr said he never intended to kill his wife but that if he had wanted to kill her he would have been able to with his skills as an archer (Pictured: a bolt through Carr's wooden front door)\nAt his trial, which concluded at Leeds Crown Court on Monday 2 June 2025, Carr told the court he followed his wife around the house drawing the bow to scare her into leaving him alone, as he stated she was controlling him.\nHe suggested that this was a build-up of pressure of working full time, his caring responsibilities for his elderly mother and his dependence on alcohol.\nHe said he never intended to kill his wife but that if he had wanted to kill her he would have been able to with his skills as an archer.\nWhen asked about the repeated use of a knife causing six significant stab wounds to her back, Carr suggested he had 'blacked out'. \nThe court heard he had no background of violence or abuse, with his behaviour on the night described as a 'one-off, out of character incident' where drink had played a part.\nDespite the horrific attack, Mrs Carr told the court in a letter, that her husband was 'a very broken man' that night but she had forgiven him and trusted that he would never hurt her again, the BBC reports. \nThe prosecution showed the violent attack with multiple weapons was carried out by someone who was overwhelmed, drunk and angry, and developed an intention to kill his wife having lost all ability of self-control.\nThe jury found Carr guilty of attempted murder and he was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court to 17 years in prison on Wednesday and an additional three years on licence following his release.\nFollowing the sentencing, Detective Chief Inspector Jonathan Sygrove said: 'Domestic violence takes many forms - the fact Carr has ultimately been jailed for attempted murder underlines just how serious incidents can be.\n\nAfter the attack which included stabbing his wife six times as she lay defenceless on their bed, Carr went and sat in his shed where police found him (pictured)\n\nWhen asked about the repeated use of a knife causing six significant stab wounds to her back, Carr suggested he had 'blacked out' (Pictured: Carr in a police van following the attack)\n\nThe jury found Carr guilty of attempted murder and he was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court to 17 years in prison on Wednesday and an additional three years on licence following his release (Pictured: Carr in custody after his frenzied attack on his wife)\n'It's hard to imagine the terror the victim felt being shot at with a bow and arrows, then set on with a knife by her own husband. This was also a harrowing incident for our officers and control room staff who responded to the 999 call, and their professionalism ensured Carr was promptly located and arrested before anything further could happen.\n'While we apply high levels of discretion when we deal with domestic violence, it's also important we raise awareness and highlight the work we do to tackle it, so people have the confidence to come forward.'\nDet Chief Insp Sygrove added: 'There's a range of support available to victims, including IDAS which helps people affected by domestic abuse and violence. You can also utilise Claires Law, which enables us to release information about any previous history of violence or abuse a person might have.\n'If you or someone you know needs help, please report it to us on 101 or 999 if it's happening now, or find out more about the support available by visiting www.idas.org.uk'\nNorth Yorkshire Police\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nHusband who tried to murder his wife with a bow and arrow before attacking her with a kitchen knife while she made a frantic 999 call is jailed for 17 years\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nWorst rated\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nAdd your comment\n\nEnter your comment\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules.\n\nSubmit Comment\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Email Sam.Lawley@mailonline.co.uk \nBy SAM LAWLEY \n Published:19:39 BST, 2 July 2025 |Updated:19:40 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nOxford is plotting a £2-a-night tax on overnight visitors staying in a hotel or college room in a bid to swell council coffers.\nGuests would be charged for each night they spend in the historic city under new plans that officials estimate could raise £2.5 million every year in tax receipts.\nFunds racked up by the levy would go towards 'improving' Oxford for both residents and tourists, councilors at a scrutiny committee meeting on Tuesday heard.\nSelf-catering accommodation and AirBnbs would be exempt from collecting the tax as they are not included in the business rate database, the Telegraph reports.\nDiana Fawcett, Oxford council's city centre manager, said: 'It's not really just about our tourists – it's about anybody who uses the city.\n'So whether you live here, whether you work here, whether you're a student here, as well as a tourist, we want to improve that experience.'\nCouncil bosses calculate that the ancient university city received 32 million visitors last year, fuelling 40,000 jobs.\nBy introducing a 'tourist tax', Oxford would be following in the footsteps of Manchester, which has implemented an accommodation business improvement district charge of £1 a night.\n\nOxford could become the first city in more than two decades to impose a congestion charge - in the council's latest move in the 'war on motorists' (Stock Photo)\n\nVisitors would be charged for each night they spend in the historic city under new plans that officials estimate could raise £2.5 million every year in tax receipts (Stock Photo)\nLiverpool, meanwhile, levies a similar tax of £2 a night. \nOxford City Council has been approached for comment. \n\n Oxford council want to impose £5 congestion charge on every car entering the city \nIt's the latest in a string of controversial policy ideas mooted in the area, following hot on the heels of proposals to impose a congestion charge - in the local authority's latest move in the 'war on motorists'.\nSuch a levy would be the first of its kind intoduced in Britain for more than two decades. \nUnder the proposed 'temporary' scheme, motorists would be slapped with a £5 fee every time they travel into the city centre.\nLocals have warned that the plans would cripple businesses in Oxford, which have already been hit by a controversial low traffic neighbourhood scheme in the city.\nIf enforced, Oxford would be just the third city in the UK to introduce a congestion charge - after London and Durham in the early 2000s.\nThe plans were proposed by Oxfordshire County Council in June and could be introduced as early as this autumn.\n\nOxfordshire County Council introduced a pilot ZEZ zone, which is the first in the country, in February 2022 with charges in place from 7am until 7pm\n\nLocals warned the ZEZ plans would cripple businesses in Oxford, which have already been hit by a controversial low traffic neighbourhood scheme in the city\n\nLow Traffic Neighbourhoods work by blocking cars from going down residential streets \nThe scheme would be enforced using automatic number plate recognition - with charging cameras placed on six major roads that lead into the city centre. \nOxford residents with a permit would be exempt from the £5 charge but anyone travelling into the city for work, tourism or shopping would have to pay.\nOxford City Council, a separate local authority, has also criticised the scheme.\nCouncil leader Susan Brown said she was concerned that the scheme would allow wealthier people 'to buy access to our streets'.\nOxford, which has a historic centre made up of a number of narrow medieval streets, has previously been named one of the most congested cities in the UK. \n\nShare or comment on this article: \nOxford plots £2-a-night 'tourist tax' for overnight visitors staying in a hotel or college room\n\nAdd comment\n\n Share what you think\n\nNo comments have so far been submitted.

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy SARAH SOTOODEH FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:19:24 BST, 2 July 2025 |Updated:19:32 BST, 2 July 2025 \n\nCharlize Theron revealed she's currently having the 'amazing' sex at age 49.\nThe Oscar winner - who recently called out Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez for their over-the-top Venetian wedding - said she is having sex with a 26-year-old in a candid interview for the Call Her Daddy podcast.\n'I've probably had three one-night stands in my entire life. But I did just recently f*** a 26-year-old and it was really f*****g amazing,' Charlize said.\nThe mom of two added: 'I've never done that. And I was like, \"Oh, this is great. OK.'\nCharlize said that she is 'having the kind of sex I never had in my twenties or in my thirties.'\n\nCharlize Theron revealed she's currently having 'amazing' sex at age 49\n\n'That part has been really exciting. But I'm not missing a relationship. I'm not missing the partnership that I think you miss when you're me,' she said. \nWhen host Alex Cooper joked that the mystery 26-year-old man is probably walking different today knowing he was intimate with the Oscar winning actress.\n\n Charlize Theron torches celebs attending Bezos-Sánchez wedding with shocking insult during charity speech \n'I will just say this, like I wish that, this goes back to, I think this is kind of like a thread throughout our conversation. Women who come across as confident, women who come across as outspoken, ones that wouldn't speak up for themselves tend to also be in bed, people who want to please males,' Charlize said.\n'Like, and I have found this in my experiences with talking to other women about this. Isn't it strange? We should be the ones that are like, “F**k you. I'm gonna have an orgasm.” And yet I, my whole life, was so concerned about...'\nAlex agreed: 'Same.'\nCharlize continued: Okay, so my advice would be this. Don't f*****g do that for two reasons. You're gonna have better orgasms and guess what? Your man's gonna like that.'\nShe added that she 'found this freedom' in her forties. \n\nThe Oscar winner - who recently called out Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez for their over-the-top Venetian wedding - said she is having sex with a 26 year old in a candid interview for the Call Her Daddy podcast\nThe star's exes include Stuart Townsend, whom she dated for eight years until 2009, as well as Sean Penn, Craig Bierko, Stephan Jenkins and Alex Dimitrijevic.\nCharlize is mom to two daughters: Jackson, 14, and August, eight.\nWhen asked about the next chapter of her life, the star said her focus is her children.\n'I love my f*****g kids so much that they can never know 'cause I can't imagine my life without them and the idea of them not being in my f*****g house scares me enough to be like, \"Who is the sad man that I'm gonna f*****g catch in six years\" and be like, \"You can have my whole closet. Just don't let me be alone in this house.\"'\n'Aside from thinking about that, I don't know, because work feels really satisfying. I really feel so blessed and so lucky that I get to do something every single day that I love that doesn't feel like work. I'm glad that I get to show my kids what that looks like.'\n'To find something that you love that, if you can have a life where you don't feel like you're working, but you are working hard, that's a very rewarding life and not all of us get to have that, so if I can continue that and make sure that my kids are okay, like that's gonna be okay for me. I'm gonna be okay,' she noted. \nThe Old Guard 2 star said she loves being able to parent her kids herself and have to run 'every f*****g thing by a guy.'\n'I f*****g love that I don't have to do any of that stuff and my children, you know, we joke, listen. I think you tell this is how we raise my kids. We don't hide this s**t,' she said.\n'I am raising, it looks from afar like I'm doing what I know, which is being a single mom because I was raised by pretty much a single mom, but I think I'm raising my kids as a single mom because of definitely avoidance of things that I know I don't want. Also understanding who I am fully and being honest with who I am and what I can give right now. And who I am is, at the time that I wanted to be a parent, was not somebody who should be having kids with another person,' she explained.\n\nThe Old Guard 2 star said she lobes being able to parent her kids herself and have to run 'every f**king thing by a guy'\nCharlize said she's steered clear of dating and relationships, instead opting to focus on raising her children.\n'This is like this moment in this time in my life now and I mean, I'll be honest. I have tried dating and I can tell that no man's moving into our house while my daughters are there and by the way, I don't think I can do it.'\nThe actress added that she 'literally can't imagine a man moving into our house and me sharing my closet.'\n'But then I imagine being an empty nester and how that part of my life will be, and by then feeling like maybe I will feel like I want to be in a relationship. There's this notion that somebody like me must be missing out on something and that people feel sorry for you somehow that you're missing out on love.'\nWhile she doesn't miss relationship, the movie star admitted to missing sex.\n'It is the thing that you don't quite realize until you have kids and I'm not saying that it replaces one love or the other, but it is such a tremendous love that I do not miss love. You know, I might miss sex,' Charlize said.\nThe award winning star said: 'I'm having the kind of sex I never had in my twenties or in my thirties, and so that part has been really exciting, but I'm not missing a relationship. I'm not missing the partnership that I think people think you miss when you're me.'\nShe admitted to being on dating apps and that she isn't interesting in dating men in the industry. \nShe revealed that her friends set her up on dates because 'apps are just horrible.' \nThe screen star isn't interesting in marriage, due to her 'fear of not being able to get out of something.'\n\nThe award winning star said: 'I'm having the kind of sex I never had in my twenties or in my thirties, and so that part has been really exciting, but I'm not missing a relationship. I'm not missing the partnership that I think people think you miss when you're me;' seen June 28\n'Marriage is a long-term commitment and I think I want long-term commitment. I just don't need to get married. So I just wanna clarify that. I will tell you in all honesty and the work that I've done on myself, I think a lot of that also has to do with the fact that I have a tremendous fear of not being able to get out of something and that's again, me just understanding me, right?'\n'And you know, now obviously by California laws, after seven years, you're in a f*****g marriage. Whether you walk down the aisle, sign a piece of paper, like it's 50-50 b***h. Like let's just be clear. So I am like, my semantics is like crazy, but I want, if I were to find a relationship, I would think of it as something that I'm aiming for for long term. I've never been somebody that really wants to like jump from one thing to another.'\n'From the time that I was in relationships, I was in one relationship after another relationship after another relationship. And so when I earlier said, I'm having sex now for the first time, like I ever had before, is because I'm not in relationships. And it's not because I'm not, I don't wanna be in relationships, but I'm seeing things for what they are, right?'\n'I'm not trying to force a circle into a square or whatever the f*****g American saying is, the peg and the hole and the, I can never say it right. But when I meet somebody, I can see where it's gonna go pretty quickly.'\nThe South African-born actress also spoke out about an unnamed director that sexually harassed her during the early beginnings of her acting career.\nShe went to his home for an audition, and she said deep down she felt like it wasn't right to audition at his home but since she was just starting her acting journey, she thought maybe it was a normal thing to audition at their house.\nCharlize said she still feels mad at herself for going and for not speaking up for herself at the time.\nShe said she won't reveal their name because she doesn't want the story to be about him. \nThe mysterious director reached out to her with a letter 'trying to explain his behavior' and that she 'must have misunderstood' what happened that night - after he heard her publicly talking about the incident.\n\nShe admitted to being on dating apps and that she isn't interesting in dating men in the industry\n\nWhile she doesn't miss relationship, the movie star admitted to missing sex\n\nCharlize said she's steered clear of dating and relationships, instead opting to focus on raising her children\nHe 'panicked,' and wrote the letter, she said, because he was afraid she would name him.\n'He started panicking. It was like waiting for me and I just realized like, I won't even say your name because you know, you're the scumbag. You know it's you and if anybody ever asks me about him, I would be completely honest and he knows that and I kind of like that. He's gotta be on a hot seat. He doesn't know when it's gonna come. I kind of like that a little more,' Charlize added.\nCall Her Daddy is available for streaming on all podcast platforms.

Those holding on to their positions in the federal government include Democratic donors, former Biden-appointees and Kamala Harris staffers and individuals bragging about being about to resist Donald Trump’s orders. (RELATED: Trump Declares War On Deep State Leakers)\n\n“I’ve got more work to do here in service of you and your family, and the president does not have the authority to remove me. So I won’t take this lying down. See you in court, Mr. President,” Richard Trumka Jr., the Commissioner at Consumer Product Safety Commission, said in a tweet after he was reinstated by a lower-court judge. \n\nSince Trump ordered his firing, Trumka Jr. has repeatedly posted videos and statements on social media speaking out against the president’s action. Trumka Jr. was previously a huge proponent of banning gas stoves, saying an “outright ban” was “real possibility,” according to the Hill.\n\n View this post on Instagram \n\n View this post on Instagram \n\nTrumka Jr. isn’t the only appointee publicly taunting the administration. Alexander Hoehn-Saric, also a commissioner at the Consumer Product Safety Commission who was reinstated in June, published several statements and an op-ed slamming Trump’s attempts to fire him. \n\n“Although done in the name of ‘efficiency,’ these cuts have simply caused chaos. By crippling core government functions, the Administration is making communities throughout this great nation less safe and life harder,” Hoehn-Saric wrote in statement upon the news of his firing. \n\nHoehn-Saric later published an op-ed in The Hill while serving as commissioner titled “Don’t make me the last chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission.” He served as chairman but stepped down in January 2025.\n\n“I don’t want to be the last confirmed chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission. And none of us want to go back to the days when the homes that we live in were ‘more dangerous than a booby-trapped mine field,'” Hoehn-Saric wrote in his opinion piece of Trump’s plan to consolidate the commission into the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nFive of the Democratic appointees fired by Trump have been reinstated by lower-court rulings. Three members of the CBP have been removed by Trump, but then took the decision to court.\n\nA judge declined to block Trump’s removal of the CBP board members, essentially warning the officials that they wouldn’t win a challenge of the ruling. The board members saw the situation as a win, however, and pointed to part of the ruling that acknowledges that “Congress intended to preclude the President (or any subordinate officials acting at his direction) from directing, supervising, or controlling the Corporation.”\n\nThen the CBP officials moved to sign an internal document that would keep the officials on the board, The Hill reported. The litigation between the officials and the Trump administration is ongoing.\n\nA White House official told the Daily Caller that since all of the individuals are in ongoing litigation, the administration isn’t going to remove them from office space in federal buildings. The official added that it was an “unusual legal situation.”\n\nThe White House did not provide information on Garza, the only appointee who appears to not be involved in an active lawsuit.\n\nA similar issue plagued Trump’s first term in office. At that time, Trump avoided any massive cuts to the federal bureaucracy even as political appointees and career officials openly discussed resisting against his agenda.\n\nIn one example, dozens of “unofficial” or “alternative” Twitter accounts were created during the first Trump administration appearing to represent the views of government staffers or agencies, CNN previously reported. Amid the controversy, the EPA banned its staffers from communicating with the media, sending press releases or promoting anything on social media.\n\nOne official who has resisted a termination order is Rochelle Garza, according to Politico. Garza was appointed by Biden to be the chair of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. She is an attorney from the Rio Grande Valley and also the president of the Texas Civil Rights Project, a left-leaning legal organization that “provides legal services to illegal immigrants and opposes election integrity measures,” according to InfluenceWatch. \n\nGarza previously served as a staff attorney for the ACLU of Texas from 2019-2021, according to LinkedIn. On her LinkedIn, Garza has condemned the Trump administration numerous times. \n\n“This week, the Trump Administration openly threatened to defy a federal court order. Let’s be clear. This is not normal and not acceptable,” Garza wrote three months ago. “Ignoring court rulings undermines the rule of law, checks and balances, and ultimately, our democracy.”\n\nLaura Gore Ross, who was a Trump-appointed member of Corporation for Public Broadcasting Board of Directors and re-appointed by Biden, is also resisting her termination, Politico reported. For eight years, Gore Ross served as the Chief of Staff to New York Attorney Generals Louis J. Lefkowitz and Robert Abrams.\n\nGore Ross has also donated to Democratic campaigns and left-leaning organizations over the years, including Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign, Obama’s 2012 campaign and more than $100,000 to the Democratic National Committee from 2008 to 2018, according to public documents. \n\nMary Boyle, a commissioner at Consumer Product Safety Commission, had her position reinstated by a lower-court judge, Politico reported. Boyle’s nomination was held up by Senate Republicans during the confirmation process because they were worried about her role in “the agency’s unauthorized disclosures of company and consumer information in 2019 and in staffing of CPSC’s import surveillance operations amid COVID-19 disruptions,” according to the National Law Review. Her nomination eventually advanced on party lines, with former Vice President Kamala Harris breaking the tie. \n\nTravis LeBlanc, a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board Member, has remained in his role due to a lower-court ruling, Politico reported. LeBlanc previously served as Special Assistant Attorney General of California and was a senior advisor to Harris when she served as California Attorney General, according to his LinkedIn profile.

Paramount faces backlash over its $16-million Trump settlement","text":"Critics blasted Paramount Global's decision to pay $16 million to settle President Trump's lawsuit over \"60 Minutes\" edits, calling the move a \"spineless capitulation\" that erodes U.S. press freedoms. Paramount late Tuesday agreed to a landmark settlement with Trump to end his $20-billion broadside against CBS News. The president will not be paid directly, or indirectly, as part of the deal, Paramount said. Instead, the money will go to cover Trump's legal fees and help finance his future presidential library. Paramount's leaders hope the settlement will help clear a path for Trump-appointed regulators to bless the company's $8-billion sale to David Ellison's Skydance Media. They wanted to tamp down tensions with the president. But journalists and others on Wednesday said the payoff will embolden attacks by Trump and his allies on news outlets. Some called the settlement a stain on the proud legacy of CBS News, the one-time home of such fearless journalists as Edward R. Murrow, Walter Cronkite and Mike Wallace. “This is a shameful decision by Paramount,\" Clayton Weimers, executive director of Reporters Without Borders USA, said in a statement. \"Shari Redstone and Paramount’s board should have stood by CBS journalists and the integrity of press freedom. Instead, they chose to reward Donald Trump for his petty legal assault.\" Trump's legal team quickly celebrated the settlement, saying: \"President Donald J. Trump delivers another win for the American people as he, once again, holds the Fake News media accountable for their wrongdoing and deceit.\" Bob Corn-Revere, chief counsel for the non-profit 1st Amendment advocacy organization Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, took an opposing view, saying wider repercussions would result. \"A cold wind just blew through every newsroom,\" Corn-Revere said in a statement. \"Paramount may have closed this case, but it opened the door to the idea that the government should be the media’s editor-in-chief.\" Federal Communications Commissioner Anna M. Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, said the settlement was \"a desperate move [by Paramount] to appease the Administration and secure regulatory approval of a major transaction currently pending before the FCC.\" “This moment marks a dangerous precedent for the 1st Amendment, and it should alarm anyone who values a free and independent press,\" Gomez said. For months, Paramount executives have been torn over how to handle Trump's $20-billion lawsuit. The dispute helped prompt the departure of two senior CBS News executives who tried to hold their ground, particularly as \"60 Minutes\" continued airing stories that took a hard look at Trump's policies and actions. Journalists were horrified by the board's willingness to settle the case rather than defend 1st Amendment freedoms. CBS News staffers feared the company would be forced to apologize when they said they did nothing wrong. (The settlement, negotiated through a mediator, did not require an apology.) The legal wrangling began in October when CBS broadcast different portions of an answer given by then-Vice President Kamala Harris to a question about the Biden administration's waning clout with Israel's prime minister. CBS' \"Face the Nation\" program ran a clip of Harris giving a muddled response to the question. A day later, \"60 Minutes\" aired a different portion of her answer. This one was forceful and succinct. CBS has acknowledged editing Harris' answer. Trump and fellow conservatives seized on the edits, claiming CBS had manipulated Harris' answer to make her appear more authoritative to enhance her standing with voters. He called the edits an example of election interference. CBS has long denied such claims. Paramount Co-Chief Executive George Cheeks said during the company's shareholder meeting Wednesday that settlements are designed for companies to avoid \"being mired in uncertainty and distraction.\" “Companies often settle litigation to avoid the high and somewhat unpredictable costs of legal defense, the risk of an adverse judgment that could result in significant financial or reputational damage, and the disruption to business operations that prolonged legal battles can cause,\" Cheeks said. That rationale did little to mollify detractors who alleged that Trump's complaints were thin. Paramount's settlement “will be remembered as one of the most shameful capitulations by the press to a president in history,\" said Seth Stern, director of advocacy for the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Paramount said the agreement with Trump included a release from threatened defamation claims. But it's not clear that Paramount's headaches will go away. Three left-leaning U.S. Senators — Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) want to take a closer look at Paramount's decision-making. In May, the senators sent a strongly worded letter to Paramount's controlling shareholder, Redstone. They cautioned that a settlement could be viewed as bribing an elected official to win favorable regulatory treatment with regard to the Skydance merger. \"This could be bribery in plain sight,\" Warren said in a statement Wednesday. \"I’m calling for a full investigation into whether or not any anti-bribery laws were broken.\" \"When Democrats retake power, I’ll be first in line calling for federal charges,\" Wyden separately wrote in a post on the Bluesky social media site. \"In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court.\" Some journalists said they feared the settlement could have a chilling effect, particularly among news organizations that lack deep pockets or have unrelated business pending before the federal government. \"CBS News may weather the financial hit, but smaller newsrooms facing similar legal threats could be pushed to the brink,\" Tim Richardson, journalism and disinformation program director at the nonprofit PEN America, said in a statement. \"The danger is clear,\" Richardson said, calling the settlement a \"spineless capitulation.\" \"Emboldened politicians and powerful actors will feel more free than ever to weaponize lawsuits and bring regulatory pressure to bear to silence and censor independent journalism.\"","summary":"Journalists and others said the payoff will embolden attacks by Trump and his allies on news outlets.

The lawsuit alleged that “60 Minutes” had edited an interview with Kamala Harris to make it more favorable to her in the lead up to the 2024 presidential election, making it one of the most laughably absurd lawsuits Trump has ever filed. But Paramount is forking over millions anyway in what many are calling a transparent bribe. And at least one elected Democrat says he’s not going to let it stand.\n\nSen. Ron Wyden, a progressive Democrat from Oregon, is not happy with the deal reached by Paramount, which will see the media company pay for Trump’s legal fees and hand millions to his presidential library. Paramount Global is trying to merge with Skydance Media, something that Trump will now be able to greenlight.\n\n“Paramount just paid Trump a bribe for merger approval,” Wyden wrote on Bluesky. “When Democrats retake power, I’ll be first in line calling for federal charges. In the meantime, state prosecutors should make the corporate execs who sold out our democracy answer in court, today.”\n\nWyden wasn’t the only Democrat upset with the deal. Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Dems, said the Redstone family, major owners of Paramount, had settled a “bogus lawsuit” and it set a dangerous precedent for both the First Amendment and what he called “government extortion.”\n\n“Paramount’s decision will only embolden Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media which he has labeled ‘the enemy of the people.'” Sanders said in a statement published by reporter Max Tani on Bluesky. “It is a dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press—an essential part of our democracy. It is a victory for a president who is attempting to stifle dissent and undermine American democracy.”\n\nSanders went on to say it’s “pretty obvious” why Paramount was choosing to “surrender to Trump.”\n\n“The Redstone family is in line to receive $2.4 billion from the sale of Paramount to Skydance, but they can only receive this money if the Trump administration approves this deal,” Sanders wrote. “In other words, the Redstone family diminished the freedom of the press today in exchange for a $2.4 billion payday.”\n\nThe part that makes all of this so ridiculous is that “60 Minutes” clearly did nothing wrong. Trump says the video was edited to make Harris look better. But if you look at the unedited interview and compare it to what aired, there’s absolutely nothing substantively different. The average viewer didn’t get a different answer than what she meant to communicate. Every edit made was clearly part of the regular splicing and dicing that happens when TV news organizations are trying to cut something together to match time constraints without significantly altering what’s been said.\n\nOn top of it all, Harris lost. It’s not like Trump can even argue that Harris benefited from the interview in a way that changed the outcome of the election. He’s just a sore winner and trying to use every tool at his disposal to advance his fascist agenda. And unless Democrats are able to radically change things, they won’t even get a chance to file those bribery charges while they’re in the minority.\n\nABC News and Meta have also reached multi-million dollar agreements to settle frivolous lawsuits with Trump which have also been seen as bribes. Those lawsuits also had no foundation but management agreed to pay anyway, just like Paramount. But as long as Trump can extort major media and technology companies, it seems like he’s just going to keep doing it.","summary":"That is, if the Dems can ever retake power.","url":"https://gizmodo.com/senator-wants-to-file-bribery-charges-over-paramounts-hush-money-to-trump-2000623400","image":"https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/07/trump-gulf-of-america-hat-july-1-2025-1200x675.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 18:20:53","author":"Matt Novak","authors":["Matt Novak"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.552},{"id":337619804,"title":"Twenty-Four Hours of Authoritarianism","text":"Not long ago, I ran into an old friend, a well-regarded Democratic intellectual who recently has moved to my right, but who still holds liberal values and is not a Donald Trump supporter. After we commiserated about the excesses of the far left, I mentioned offhandedly that Trump’s maniacal authoritarianism makes the fact that Democrats can’t get their act together so much worse.\n\nHe reacted, to my surprise, with indignation. Trump wasn’t canceling elections, he protested, nor was he calling brownshirts into the streets. So how could I call the president authoritarian?\n\nMany highly educated Americans share my friend’s intuition. They believe that if elections are occurring and criticism of the president is not banned outright, then democracy is not under threat. They fail to see the administration’s slow-moving efforts to break down the norms and institutional barriers that otherwise inhibit the ruling party from asphyxiating its opposition. Political scientists who study democracy have a term that clarifies the phenomenon: democratic backsliding. Backslide far enough, and you end up in something called “competitive authoritarianism.” Elections are still held, but the ruling party has commandeered so many institutions in society and has violated so many laws to enhance its own power that the opposition hardly stands a chance. These are dry phrases, but they capture the way in which democracy and authoritarianism are not binary alternatives, but values that lie on a continuum.\n\nI thought back to my friend’s comments yesterday, because in a single day, Trump took or was revealed to have taken six shocking new assaults on liberal democracy. They would have been shocking, anyway, before he spent a decade bludgeoning our civic nerve endings to the point where these things now register as mere routine politics.\n\nYesterday alone:\n\n1. Trump floated the notion of arresting New York City Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani. The president was responding to a question about Mamdani’s promise to “stop masked ICE agents from deporting our neighbors.” But he proceeded to suggest that he was explicitly targeting Mamdani’s political beliefs—“We don’t need a communist in this country”—and publicly entertained the groundless accusation that Mamdani, a U.S. citizen, is “here illegally.”\n\n2. Trump threatened to prosecute CNN for reporting on the existence of an app that allows users to alert one another to ICE activity and on a Defense Intelligence Agency preliminary analysis suggesting that American air strikes had set back Iran’s nuclear program by only a few months. “We’re working with the Department of Justice to see if we can prosecute them for that,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced, referring to the ICE-app story, “because what they’re doing is actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities, operations and we’re going to actually go after them and prosecute them.” Trump endorsed Noem’s threat, and added, “They may be prosecuted also for giving false reports on the attack on Iran.”\n\n3. The president mused about the prospect of financially punishing Elon Musk for criticizing the Republican megabill. “No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,” he wrote on Truth Social. “Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!”\n\nTo examples such as these, my friend might reply that Trump doesn’t always deliver on his rhetoric. That is true, but only to a point. Especially in his second term, Trump follows through on quite a lot of his threats. Indeed, yesterday’s litany of authoritarian moves is not limited to words. It includes at least three actions:\n\n4. The New York Times reported that Trump has appointed Jared L. Wise to the Justice Department’s Weaponization Working Group. In 2023, federal prosecutors had charged Wise, a former FBI agent, for participating in the storming of the Capitol on January 6, 2021, allegedly egging on fellow rioters to assault police officers with shouts of “Kill ’em! Kill ’em! Kill ’em!” Like the rest of the January 6 defendants, Wise was pardoned on the first day of Trump’s second term. Now he is working under Ed Martin, a fellow supporter of Trump’s efforts to secure an unelected second term in 2021, and who has tried to intimidate various administration targets with a variety of legal and extralegal punishments.\n\n5. The administration impounded $7 billion of Education Department funding for after-school and summer programs, English learners, teacher training, and other school functions. The funds had been appropriated by Congress, but Trump once again decided to seize the power of the purse from Congress for himself, in violation of the structure laid out by the Constitution.\n\n6. Paramount, the parent company of CBS, settled a groundless nuisance lawsuit Trump had filed against the CBS show 60 Minutes. The suit absurdly claims that Trump suffered mental distress because the show aired an interview with Kamala Harris in 2024 that had been edited for length (which is, in fact, standard practice in television news, as Trump and his lawyers surely know). The only apparent reason Paramount settled was to grease the skids for the Trump administration to approve the company’s bid to buy a Hollywood studio. (The company has denied that this was its motivation.)\n\nNone of these moves is a one-off. All follow what has become standard practice in the second Trump term. The president has declared a new order in which the supporters of his insurrection have been vindicated and freed from any consequences for their crimes, the president claims sole authority over the government’s powers of spending and regulation, and these powers are to be used only to punish his enemies and reward his friends.\n\nThis new order, if unchecked, will at some point reach a level at which opposition becomes prohibitively dangerous and the commanding heights of business, media, and academia all submit to Trump’s whims. We might not arrive at that end point. But it is very clearly where Trump is trying to take us.","summary":"Donald Trump had a very busy Tuesday.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/07/twenty-four-hours-authoritarianism/683401/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vOb3TPKs7TeeawMBx9fyskeToEM=/0x43:2000x1085/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/07/2025_07_02_trump_authoritarian/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 18:18:00","author":"Jonathan Chait","authors":["Jonathan Chait"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.688},{"id":337580154,"title":"For Skydance, the ’60 Minutes’ Settlement Means Welcome to the Trump Circus | Analysis","text":"For Skydance Media, Paramount Global’s settlement of Donald Trump’s lawsuit can be seen as a preview of coming attractions, and a reminder that when it comes to a litigious president eager to use levers of government to pursue personal agendas, the maxim “Be careful what you wish for” has a way of consistently rearing its head.\n\nGiven the widely held assumption that the $16-million settlement was intended to grease the wheels to earn approval of the $8-billion Paramount-Skydance merger, Skydance CEO David Ellison and his father/benefactor, billionaire Larry Ellison, would outwardly appear to have won.\n\nThe real headline for them, though, might be “Welcome to the circus,” with all the potential public-relations headaches their stewardship of a company with Paramount’s diverse roster of holdings could entail. While it’s not the first media company to bend the knee to Trump, the stature of CBS News and “60 Minutes” is the sort of symbolic blow to journalism that means the deal will draw extra scrutiny. \n\nEarly signs of potential fallout were already in evidence Wednesday, offering a taste of running a studio that not only operates a news division Trump despises but employs late-night comics Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart (whose shows are mercifully dark this week), along with other high-profile fare like “South Park,” all with the ability to get under Trump’s famously thin skin.\n\nThe problem with employing millionaire comedians and entertainers, alas, is that they have a perverse way of biting the hands that feed them, and exulting in doing so.\n\nNotably, the producers of “South Park” have already criticized the merger as a “shitshow,” on the heels of a decision to delay its new-season premiere.\n\nAs media mogul Barry Diller sympathetically noted, Paramount chair Shari Redstone faced an impossible mission not of her own making or choosing, and the seemingly inevitable (or at least long-anticipated) resolution of Trump’s lawsuit against CBS and “60 Minutes” managed to please no one, except perhaps a litigious president who, based on history, is seldom mollified by displays of weakness.\n\nSimply put, the Paramount merger had a gun to its head, and the company chose to pay the ransom.\n\nGiven that, will the new management cave the next time Trump complains, and are they ready — even after observing Redstone’s tortured example — for the public-relations disaster they’ll face if they do? And is anyone naive enough to think Trump’s friendship with Larry Ellison will be enough to stave off, or at least defuse, such flare-ups?\n\nOf course, Redstone had plenty of company in the staging of this journalistic tragedy/farce, beginning with Trump, who has again revealed his contempt for the First Amendment; and yes, the Ellisons, who could have spoken out forcefully in stating their commitment to CBS News but opted not to, while reportedly seeking to leverage Larry Ellison’s relationship with Trump behind the scenes. (Trump has spoken enthusiastically about the Ellisons taking over at Paramount, for whatever that’s worth.)\n\nRedstone finally took the expected step — ignoring warnings and pleas from CBS News, “60 Minutes’” high-profile talent, journalism experts and several U.S. senators — by agreeing to settle Trump’s frivolous lawsuit over a pre-election profile of then-rival Kamala Harris. By doing so, she clearly hoped to smooth the way for the merger, which will allow her to parachute out of the company she inherited from her father, Sumner, not a moment too soon.\n\nIn the small-achievements department, the $16-million settlement did not include an apology or admission of wrongdoing, not that such distinctions will matter once Trump has put the story through his social media blender. For Trump and his loyalists, it will be hailed as another victory over the hated “liberal media,” just one more log to fuel the fire that produces enough smoke to obscure truth and facts. Let the gloating begin.\n\nWhile the long-term impact is more difficult to discern, the settlement has dealt another reputational blow to CBS News as the Ellisons prepare to take over, diminishing “60 Minutes,” one of Paramount’s prized assets, and demoralizing the program’s reporters and staffers.\n\n“Paramount’s decision to settle a meritless lawsuit rather than stand behind its journalists at CBS News is a spineless capitulation,” PEN America, the literary and human rights organization, said in a statement that summed up much of the response as denunciations rolled in Wednesday.\n\nEven if the terms aren’t as onerous as some feared, the settlement feels like another terrible precedent, softened only in part by other media companies that already “bent the knee” to curry favor with the president. That hall of shame includes Meta and Disney’s ABC, whose actions have merely exposed both the transactional nature of dealing with Trump and the extent to which Federal Communications Commission chairman Brendon Carr has appeared willing to act as the president’s personal pit bull, using the threats of investigations and regulatory oversight as a cudgel, as fellow commissioner Anna Gomez has noted.\n\nMincing few words, nine U.S. senators wrote Redstone in May warning that any settlement could be tantamount to bribery, stating, “Under the federal bribery statute, it is illegal to corruptly give anything of value to public officials to influence an official act. If Paramount officials make these concessions in a quid pro quo arrangement to influence President Trump or other Administration officials, they may be breaking the law.”\n\nWhether the agreement meets the legal definition of that — and attorneys have expressed skepticism that it would — it’s hard to quibble with the optics, spirit or precedent it sets.\n\n“Paramount’s decision will only embolden Trump to continue attacking, suing and intimidating the media which he has labeled ‘the enemy of the people,’” said Senator Bernie Sanders. “It is a dark day for independent journalism and freedom of the press — an essential part of our democracy.”\n\nCBS has already endured a steady drip of departures as the “60 Minutes” controversy has played out, including executive producer Bill Owens and CBS News president Wendy McMahon, who chose not to preside over the network’s surrender and idly endure Paramount’s corporate interference.\n\nDepending on what comes next — especially if the Ellisons try to implement further changes to create a more Trump-friendly news organization, as some reports have indicated — more principled resignations could follow.\n\nGranted, CBS management has besmirched the “60 Minutes’” reputation before, including efforts to protect another pending merger 30 years ago, as recounted by the 1999 movie “The Insider.” Only then, it was concern about a lawsuit by Big Tobacco that caused the company’s lawyers to retreat, not a U.S. president with a vindictive streak.\n\nAgain, Paramount isn’t really the villain here, just the latest appeaser. After weathering of what felt like death by a thousand cuts as the “60 Minutes” situation dragged on, as Diller noted, “If a guillotine is at your throat and it costs you $20 million or whatever to settle this lawsuit so that you can get out of going into bankruptcy or close to it, then I’m sympathetic to that.”\n\nRedstone thankfully leaves with her head still firmly attached, but because she couldn’t achieve that without staining CBS News’ integrity, the Ellisons inherit one unit that has been significantly wounded, with the prospect of additional casualties to come.\n\nPrincipally known for its movie business, which includes collaborating with Paramount on the “Mission: Impossible” franchise, Skydance is preparing to take over multiple far-flung businesses once the merger goes through. Yet as this sad if predictable drama over “60 Minutes” comes to a close, it feels much less like a final reckoning than just the latest chapter of the media wars being waged under Trump, with no assurances the sequels won’t be a whole lot worse.","summary":"Paramount's settlement deal might clear the way for the Skydance merger, but it won't be the last Trump-related headache the studio will likely face\n\n\nThe post For Skydance, the &#8217;60 Minutes&#8217; Settlement Means Welcome to the Trump Circus | Analysis appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-paramount-settlement-skydance-impact/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/David-Ellison-and-Donald-Trump.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 18:13:46","author":"Big Tobacco,Brian Lowry","authors":["Big Tobacco","Brian Lowry"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.111},{"id":337648614,"title":"COLUMNS AND OP-ED: The Bezos wedding was a study in disingenuous billionaire behavior","text":"If last week was the best of times for Zohran Mamdani and the working people of New York City, it was the worst of times for the billionaires who spent a small fortune trying to stop him from securing the city’s Democratic mayoral nomination. The media mogul Barry Diller, to name just one, donated a cool $250,000 to Andrew Cuomo’s campaign, only to see the disgraced former governor lose by a decisive margin.\n\nBut Diller would soon be able to drown his disappointment in Great Gatsby-themed cocktails as he joined Tom Brady, Ivanka Trump and at least three Kardashians for the cheeriest event on this season’s oligarchic social calendar: the Venetian wedding of the former TV journalist Lauren Sánchez and the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nIt was a juxtaposition that even CNN questioned, as the network cut from an interview with Mamdani to coverage of the gilded spectacle. The reportedly $50m affair booked all nine of Venice’s yacht ports, closed parts of the city to the public and forced the relocation of hotel guests to make room for the happy couple. It all served as a stark if sumptuous reminder that there is no expense the megarich won’t pay to secure their own comfort – except, of course, the toll their extravagance takes on the communities from whom they extract their wealth.\n\nThe lovebirds’ choice of Venice alone demonstrates their carelessness. Because the city comprises more than 100 islands in the Adriatic Sea, it’s uniquely vulnerable to rising sea levels driven by warming global temperatures. Though Sánchez claims to be “dedicated to fighting climate change”, and Bezos has called the issue “the biggest threat to our planet”, their guests arrived in the City of Bridges via 96 private jets, the most carbon-intensive mode of transportation. Bezos has made splashy commitments to fighting climate change, like pledging $10bn to his Bezos Earth Fund, while Amazon has promised to become carbon neutral by 2040. But emissions from Amazon’s delivery fleet soared from 2019 to 2023, and its newest data center will guzzle millions of gallons of water and the energy equivalent of one million homes every year.\n\nThis disingenuousness is as much a business strategy for Bezos as Prime’s two-day delivery, enabling him to launder his reputation without hurting his bottom line. The pattern played out last year with his ownership of the Washington Post – where, as soon as he felt threatened by an ascendant Donald Trump, journalistic integrity fell overboard more quickly than an inebriated wedding guest on a luxury gondola.\n\nAs I covered in a column earlier this year, Bezos killed the Post’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, directed the editorial board to publish op-eds that only support “personal liberties and free markets” and oversaw the exodus of more than 20 reporters and editors. Pamela Weymouth, granddaughter of trailblazing Post publisher Katharine Graham, described this capitulation in a recent piece for the Nation as endangering “the very thing that makes America a democracy”.\n\nIn fairness to Bezos, though, charity-washing is an occupational hazard for billionaires. Mark Zuckerberg initially donated to organizations fighting the California housing crisis that he helped exacerbate, before quietly ending his funding this year. The Gates Foundation gives 90% of its funding to non-profits in wealthy countries rather than the impoverished ones whose GDPs are smaller than its namesake’s net worth. The magnanimity of the uber-wealthy tends to produce what the journalist Anand Giridharadas has called “fake change”, or efforts that stop short of systemic change because those systems underpin the benefactors’ vast wealth.\n\nThat’s why any vision of progressive change cannot rely on Bezos or his celebrity wedding guests to operate against their self-interest. (No, not even Oprah.) A Green New Deal will not come from oligarchical guilt, but from mass movements. Like the one that deployed almost 30,000 door knockers and pooled funds from 27,000 donors to share Mamdani’s message of genuine economic empowerment.\n\nMamdani’s victory on Tuesday added to a growing body of proof that even billionaires don’t always get what they want. Last year, Elon Musk spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars electing Republicans, but no amount of money could save him from Donald Trump’s mercurial temper. Nor did his wealth sway the voters of Wisconsin, where he contributed $21m to a state supreme court candidate who ended up losing by 10 points.\n\nVoters’ growing skepticism of the 1% is no doubt being stoked by grassroots activism. Like in Venice, where local protesters threatened to fill canals with inflatable crocodiles, forcing the wedding of the century to relocate to the city’s outskirts. Back stateside, progressives Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez continue to draw record crowds across the country on their Fighting Oligarchy tour. At a recent stop in Oklahoma – a state Trump won by 33 points – Sanders spoke to a standing-room only crowd.\n\nMight a billionaire backlash be building, just in time for next year’s midterms?","summary":"","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jul/02/bezos-wedding-billionaire-oligarchy-climate","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f2e9d078f510de133d46be5f02d70d87ec63044/239_0_2398_1918/master/2398.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3B","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 18:02:26","author":"Katrina Vanden Heuvel","authors":["Katrina Vanden Heuvel"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.01},{"id":337581312,"title":"Jack Ciattarelli Dealt Polling Blow in New Jersey Governor Race","text":"Republican Jack Ciattarelli was dealt a polling blow in the latest survey of New Jersey voters ahead of the gubernatorial race against Democratic Representative Mikie Sherrill later this year.Newsweek reached out to the Ciattarelli and Sherrill campaigns for comment via email.Why It MattersNew Jersey's off-year gubernatorial election has key implications for both political parties in a state that shifted rightward in the 2024 presidential race.Sherrill will face questions about whether she can win back voters who shifted toward Republicans in last year's presidential race, such as young and Latino voters. Ciattarelli will be working to build off of President Donald Trump's progress in the state, which he lost by six points against Vice President Kamala Harris last November.The Rutgers poll gives an independent look at the race after several internal polls have been released since the primary last month.What to KnowThe latest poll from Rutgers University gave Sherrill, a moderate Democrat representing a suburban district, a significant lead over Ciattarelli.Fifty-one percent of voters said they would back Sherrill, compared to 31 percent planning to back Ciattarelli, according to the survey. When leaners are included, Sherrill's lead grew, with 56 percent supporting her and 35 percent saying they would cast their ballot for Ciattarelli.Ashley Koning, assistant research professor and director of the Eagleton Center for Public Interest Polling at Rutgers, wrote in a polling write-up that early polls are a \"baseline or a barometer of how voters are feeling in the moment – not as some crystal ball predicting the future four months from now.\"A lot can happen between now and November, and we know this gap will very likely narrow in the next several months. We only need to look back to 2021 to see how much a race can change throughout a cycle. Add to this an intense national political landscape that will, once again, surely play a role in the governor's race here at home. Come November, what will matter is who actually turns out to vote,\" she wrote.Fifty-two percent of respondents said Trump is a \"major factor\" in their vote, while 18 percent said he is a \"minor\" factor. Trump has endorsed Ciattarelli, who was the GOP nominee in the 2021 gubernatorial race.The poll surveyed 621 adults from June 13 to June 16 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.4 percentage points.In 2021, Ciattarelli narrowly lost to Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, who is not running again due to term limits.New Jersey has been seen as a solidly Democratic state. But Trump pulled off a stronger showing in 2024, holding Harris to the Democrats' smallest margin in years. About 46 percent of Garden State voters cast their ballots for Trump, compared to 52 percent who supported Harris.Republicans have not won the state at the presidential level since 1988 but have still performed well in some gubernatorial races. Republicans last won New Jersey's governor race in 2013.Republicans have not won a New Jersey gubernatorial race since 2013 and haven't carried it on the presidential level since 1988. But Republicans see a chance to make more inroads with voters after Trump narrowed his margin in the state by 10 points. He lost it by 6 points in 2024, down from a 16-point loss in 2020 and 14 in 2016.Other polls have shown a closer race between Sherrill and Ciattarelli. An internal GOP poll from last month, conducted by National Research, showed that 45 percent of New Jersey voters are leaning toward Sherrill, and 42 percent are planning to back Ciattarelli. The poll surveyed 600 likely voters on June 11-12 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.What People Are SayingKoning wrote in the poll report: \"Trump's influence appears to be more of a benefit to Sherrill right now, given key groups more likely to support her are also more likely to claim the president is a factor in their vote choice, while those more supportive of Ciattarelli do not. While Trump's endorsement may have helped in the primaries, these numbers are an early sign that the endorsement may play differently when it comes to the general.\"Ciattarelli strategist Chris Russell told The New Jersey Globe: \"In 2021, the Monmouth Poll screwed up the New Jersey governor's race so badly they got shut down. Eagleton is worse and next. From sampling adults instead of registered or likely voters to a turnout model that is pure fantasy, this poll is a steaming pile of s***.\"Kyle Kondik of Sabato's Crystal Ball, in a June 11 report: \"The main reasons to favor Sherrill are that she has been a good electoral performer in the House—although she was not strongly pushed in her four general election races—and that she is a Democrat running in what is still a Democratic-leaning state in what should be at least a modestly Democratic-leaning environment with Donald Trump in the White House. That said, she is also running for a third straight Democratic gubernatorial term, so Ciattarelli can make an argument for change at the state level.\"What Happens NextThe New Jersey gubernatorial election is scheduled for November 4, 2025. The Cook Political Report classifies the race as Lean Democrat, meaning it is \"considered competitive,\" but Sherrill has \"an advantage.\"","summary":"A new poll showed Ciattarelli trailing Democratic candidate Mikie Sherrill in the critical gubernatorial election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jack-ciattarelli-polling-blow-new-jersey-governor-race-2093767","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2675794/new-jersey-gubernatorial-candidate-jack-ciattarelli.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 17:43:46","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.083},{"id":337581578,"title":"Vinod Khosla's dire warning: AI could wipe out 80% of jobs and crush Fortune 500 giants by 2030","text":"Tech investor and billionaire entrepreneur Vinod Khosla has warned that artificial intelligence is advancing so quickly it could automate most jobs, and, by the 2030s, some of the Fortune 500 companies will be gone, according to a report.During an interview on the 'Uncapped with Jack Altman' podcast, Khosla shared his predictions, saying AI will be able to perform 80% of any economically valuable job within just five more years, and by 2040, he predicts, people won’t need to work at all to survive, as per a report by Fortune.A Wild Technological Shift Is Already UnderwayA venture capitalist and early investor in companies like Square and Instacar described that the current technology cycle as “crazy and frenetic,” and adding that, “I’ve never seen a cycle like this…almost every job is being reinvented, every material thing is being reinvented differently with AI as a driver,” as quoted in the report.

If she does, the GOP nomination would likely be hers for the taking. “Republicans in the state love her,” Yates tells me. They also seem to love her father-in-law—he won the state in each of the last three elections—and may be willing to overlook the fact that she now lives in Florida, where she previously flirted with an open Senate seat. “They think about her as a North Carolinian,” Yates says.\nDonald Trump, who effectively brought Tillis’s Senate career to an end—would likely go all out in service of hers, especially given the importance of the state in 2026’s midterms. To Democrats, the seat in an occasionally purple state represents an opportunity to loosen the president’s grip on the Senate and put a real check on his second term. To Trump, it’s an opportunity to strengthen it, to drive another stake into the Democrats’ hearts, and to replace an insufficiently loyal member with one who will show him the proper fealty—perhaps one bearing his surname.\nBut the president has a habit of making primary picks that turn into general election losers, including in North Carolina. Just last year, in the state’s gubernatorial race, he backed Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson, the far-right Republican who, among other things, was found by a CNN report to have allegedly described himself as a “Black Nazi”—in comments he purportedly left on a porn site. (Robinson denied that he had posted the comments.) Democrat Josh Stein beat him by more than 14 points.\nOne imagines Lara Trump would be more competitive than that. But would she have the chops to beat, say, Roy Cooper—the popular two-term former governor who is flirting with a Democratic run for the seat? Some Republicans certainly think so. She is “the worst-case scenario for Democrats,” Yates tells me. “They can celebrate Tillis not being on the ballot if they want to. But I think if Lara Trump gets in, it’s a case of be careful of what you ask for—you just may have gotten it.”\nTo Democrats, “North Carolina was and continues to be the biggest pickup opportunity…in the 2026 US Senate map,” says Morgan Jackson, an adviser to Cooper. Tillis was already “the weakest incumbent in the country on either side of the aisle,” Jackson tells me. And any Republican who may seek to replace him—be it Lara Trump, RNC chair Michael Whatley, or one of the no-name GOP lawmakers from deep-red districts who have seemed interested in running—would enter the race untested in a statewide election. That would be a stark contrast from Cooper, who had been under consideration as Kamala Harris’s 2024 running mate but took himself out of contention. He would not only be a “great candidate for the Democratic Party,” but holds credibility with independents and moderate Republicans, as North Carolina GOP strategist Wayne King tells me.\n“It will be a true toss-up,” King predicts.\nRather than face the primary challenge Trump vowed to support, Tillis announced he’d retire, saying that “leaders who are willing to embrace bipartisanship, compromise, and demonstrate independent thinking are becoming an endangered species.” No longer bound by electoral constraints, Tillis then took to the Senate floor to denounce the mega-bill, with its deep Medicaid cuts, as a “betray[al]” of the promises Trump made on the campaign trail. “I don’t bow to anybody when the people of North Carolina are at risk,” Tillis told reporters afterward, “and this puts them at risk.”\nThe part about not “bow[ing]” to anybody—well, that’s debatable. Tillis reportedly worked behind the scenes to sink Pete Hegseth’s nomination as defense secretary earlier this year, only to cast his vote for him after a Trump primary threat. (Tillis has disputed The New York Times’ reporting on the circumstances behind his Hegseth vote and has said he was carefully evaluating the nominee before voting to confirm him. The senator did not respond to Vanity Fair’s request seeking comment on his retirement announcement.) Still, by the standards of the MAGA movement, Tillis lacked sufficient loyalty to Trump—drawing public attacks from members of Trump’s inner circle and enjoying just 25% approval in one poll this spring.\nCooper, that poll suggested, would enter the race as the favorite. But he is still undecided about a run. Tillis’s retirement “changes the trajectory of the race,” Jackson tells me. “It does not change the trajectory of Cooper’s decision-making,” he adds.\nA lot could ride on it. Democrats have a clearer path to retaking the House than the Senate, where they’ll have a hard enough time defending the 47 seats they hold now—let alone gain back the majority, as Chuck Schumer has promised. But the best defense is a good offense, as the adage goes, and if Democrats can go on the attack in North Carolina, a state Barack Obama won less than 20 years ago but that has seen declining investment from the national party since? “When you look at the future of the Democratic Party, it runs through the South,” says Anderson Clayton, chair of the North Carolina Democratic Party. “We’re excited to kick a Republican’s ass in 2026.”\nBut 2026 is still a ways away—and so is any hope of breaking the fever of Trumpism that not only Democrats, but Republicans like Tillis, have succumbed to. “Senator Tillis has had some issues with the Republican base for a long time,” as King, an adviser to North Carolina representative Greg Murphy, tells me. But “a lot of the credit to the success in North Carolina politics, on the Republican side, is a credit to Thom Tillis.”\nWhat does it say that Tillis is now something of a persona non grata in the national GOP?\n“There’s not room in politics at this point for an independent thinker that may disagree with his party at times,” King tells me. “The Trump movement is widely known to be a very loyal movement. If you cross some of those voters, you have problems.”","summary":"With Thom Tillis’s abrupt retirement announcement, the Tar Heel State could either be Trump’s best chance to tighten his grip on the Senate—or Democrats’ best chance to break it.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/north-carolina-senate-seat-lara-trump","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/686441bdd1c7115d08767790/16:9/w_2000,h_1125,c_limit/Lara-Trump-North-Carolina.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-02 17:36:20","author":"Eric Lutz","authors":["Eric Lutz"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.056},{"id":337639010,"title":"Latino Voters and the Political Earthquake in New York","text":"“To the Democratic and Republican establishments, especially those gearing up for re-election next year, I would say: pay attention to the Mamdani campaign. It seems many Latinos are, and they will certainly make their opinions heard at the ballot box again.”\n\nThis analysis is part of a series of columns exploring the role of the Latino vote in the city’s 2025 municipal elections. Read more here, here and here. \n\nElections that produce seismic shifts in the political landscape are rare. With the shocking win last week of Zohran Mamdani, a 33-year-old democratic socialist assemblyman from Queens, New York experienced one of these shifts. Indeed, Mamdani’s victory in the Democratic primary is better understood as an unexpected political earthquake.\n\nFew expected Mamdani to win. Many observers wondered whether he could pull together the type of coalition needed to defeat a longtime political powerhouse. Could he expand the electorate? Could he energize younger voters? Could he appeal to and turn out low-propensity voters like Asians and Latinos?\n\nApparently Mamdani did all the above. And interestingly, it appears that he has won a plurality of the Latino vote.\n\nThat in itself is a feat. Conventional wisdom held that Mamdani could not peel away enough Latino voters from Andrew Cuomo, considering that Latinos have always viewed the former governor favorably.Amidst all of his troubles, Latinos remained loyal to a governor they felt had responded to many of their needs. When Hurricane Maria ravaged the island of Puerto Rico, Cuomo stepped up by coordinating flights to deliver goods and emergency services assistance. Likewise his responses to crises in the Dominican Republic. Latinos remember such efforts.\n\nSo, what gives? How and where did Mamdani manage to win a crucial voting bloc that Cuomo needed?The New York Times has actually provided an excellent breakdown of the election results by a number of demographics, including ethnicity, based on U.S. Census and City Planning data. \n\nI have examined the preliminary first round votes of the mayoral candidates within Latino-majority election districts. These districts were identified using the L2 voter file, which not only draws on Census data but numerous other sources to identify ethnic information as precisely as possible. \n\nWith this data, I have lasered in on election districts that are more than 60 percent Latino, so as to avoid the complications of deciphering Latino voters in election districts that are more diverse. (Until voter files are updated, we will not have a complete picture of the magnitude of this election. Thus, all current analyses, including this one, demand caution.)\n\nHere’s what I found:\n\nIn Manhattan, Mamdani outdid Cuomo by just over 2,000 votes. His greatest success was in Washington Heights and Inwood, the 72nd Assembly district. Mamdani lost the Latino-majority election districts in the Lower East Side by 151 votes. He won the super-majority Latino election districts in East Harlem (68th Assembly District) by 92 votes and the 71st Assembly district, covering parts of Hamilton Heights, Harlem, and lower Washington Heights, by 657 votes. Remember, I am only examining super-majority Latino election districts, so these results do not refer to the overall vote in these respective districts.\n\nNotably, most of the elected officials in these areas did not endorse Mamdani, including Congressman Adriano Espaillat, whose district encompasses all these neighborhoods. Only State Sen. Robert Jackson and Councilmember Carmen De La Rosa endorsed the presumptive Democratic nominee (I am not factoring in those elected to party positions who made their own endorsements in the race).\n\nThe Bronx tells a different story with the Latino vote. Cuomo handily beat Mamdani in most of the majority-Latino sections in the Bronx, which is the only majority-Latino borough in the city. In the South Bronx, 51 percent of voters went for Cuomo. In the Kingsbridge, Fordham, and Belmont neighborhoods, 51 percent of voters went for Cuomo and 39 percent for Mamdani. \n\nOf the Soundview, Longwood and Hunts Point neighborhoods, 57 percent of votes went for Cuomo. Mamdani held on to 31 percent. And we see similar results in the Morris Heights, University Heights, and Tremont neighborhoods. In the Bronx, too, Cuomo earned the lion’s share of endorsements from Latino elected officials (State Sen. Gustavo Rivera bucked the trend, strongly supporting Mamdani). This election proves once again that most endorsements are meaningless and very few endorsers have the capacity to move the needle on any given election.\n\nMoving to Brooklyn, I note that Mamdani won these super-majority Latino election districts over Cuomo by a total of 1,664 votes. Mamdani’s largest support was in Sunset Park (51st Assembly District), Bushwick, and Williamsburg (53rd Assembly District). Because of the stark gentrification of these neighborhoods, especially the latter two, I have been especially careful to identify those precincts which are 60 percent-plus Latino. In the 54th Assembly District, covering parts of East New York and Cypress Hills, Mamdani bested Cuomo by 21 votes.\n\nThe Queens results in Latino neighborhoods present us with even more fascinating realities. I looked at the 60 percent-plus Latino election districts in Corona, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, Ozone Park and Ridgewood. Mamdani won those precincts by 1,151 votes. While these numbers may appear similar to results in Manhattan and Brooklyn, they show an interesting dynamic in Latino voting patterns, particularly in Queens.\n\nMy analysis of the presidential election in Queens showed an increase in support for Donald Trump, though this increase was not as pronounced as some thought. Of all Latino neighborhoods in the city, Queens saw the most significant decline in support for the Democratic presidential nominee, Kamala Harris. Recalling this very recent history makes the current mayoral primary results in these neighborhoods seem erratic. How could Latinos vote for a democratic socialist after voting for the conservative authoritarianism of Donald Trump?\n\nIf anything, these results remind us yet again of what has now become almost a cliché: Latinos are not homogenous. We do not fit any once-size-fits-all formulations. Latinos are quite diverse in cultural variety, countries of origin, language nuances, and political philosophies. This can also be seen at the ballot box. In fact, we can see it in this election—most Bronx Latinos went with Cuomo, while a plurality of Latinos in other boroughs went with Mamdani.\n\nMoreover, Latino support for Mamdani, particularly in Queens, should help us understand that the increase in support for Trump in 2024 was not necessarily an indication of an ideological rightward shift. What these results may be telling us is that economic populist messaging resonates deeply with Latino audiences. And this should come as no surprise. It surely was not a surprise for Mamdani. Mamdani, a truly generational political talent, has understood quite well the plight of struggling communities, like Latinos, whose quotidian realities evoke continuing economic anxieties.\n\nA recent Columbia Center on Poverty and Social Policy and Robin Hood report shows that Latinos are the poorest ethnic group in New York City, followed closely by Asian and then Black New Yorkers. It should come as no surprise, then, that Mamdani, who lasered in on affordability issues, would earn the support of a plurality of Latinos, and win the Asian vote. Mamdani’s support among Black New Yorkers was also higher than some anticipated.\n\nIt should also come as no surprise that most Latinos do not see fare-free buses, no cost childcare, and freezing rents as a vice. These are issues that Latinos care deeply about because their very livelihoods depend on all these important, day-to-day matters.\n\nTo the Democratic and Republican establishments, then, especially those gearing up for re-election next year, I would say: pay attention to the Mamdani campaign. It seems many Latinos are, and they will certainly make their opinions heard at the ballot box again.\n\nEli Valentin is a former Gotham Gazette contributor and currently serves as assistant dean of graduate and leadership studies at Virginia Union University.

Appearing on CNN to discuss the news, media reporter Brian Stelter said it was a \"disturbing development\" for the news media to simply pay off Trump to make him \"go away.\" \"It does create a worrisome, slippery slope,\" he said. \"This is insane, and boycotts [may be] called for,\" CNN commentator and former congressman Adam Kinzinger wrote. Paramount Global and CBS agreed on Tuesday to pay Trump a sum that could reach north of $30 million to settle the lawsuit against the network. Trump will receive $16 million upfront. This will cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes, to be determined at Trump’s discretion. There is anticipation that there will be another allocation in the mid-eight figures set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future, Fox News Digital has learned. With these considerations, CBS would pay well in excess of the $15 million ABC paid Trump to settle a defamation lawsuit last year. Current Paramount management disputes the additional allocation. FAIR ELECTION FUND URGES FCC TO HOLD CBS ACCOUNTABLE FOR 'UNLAWFUL CONDUCT’ RELATED TO ’60 MINUTES’ INTERVIEW \"Presidential extortion as a tool of power and corruption,\" David Frum, a writer for The Atlantic, posted on X. Sources close to the situation told Fox News Digital that CBS has agreed to update its editorial standards to install a mandatory new rule. Going forward, the network will promptly release full, unedited transcripts of future presidential candidates’ interviews. People involved in the settlement talks have referred to this as the \"Trump Rule.\" Marlow Stern, a professor at the Columbia Journalism School, said the president effectively blackmailed Paramount and accused him of an \"unprecedented level of corruption.\" \"The deal is the clearest sign yet of Trump's ability to intimidate major American institutions,\" David Enrich, an editor at The New York Times, wrote. \"Capitulation is for cowards. All it does is embolden the bully,\" Tara Setmayer, a former adviser for the left-wing Lincoln Project, wrote. Trump was seeking $20 billion in his lawsuit against CBS over its handling of a \"60 Minutes\" interview last year with then-Vice President Kamala Harris, accusing the network of election interference leading up to the 2024 contest. CBS is not acknowledging any journalistic wrongdoing with the settlement. CBS BLASTS TRUMP’S LAWSUIT AS ‘MERITLESS’ DESPITE RECENT $15 MILLION SETTLEMENT OFFER The Bulwark's Sam Stein also called out Paramount. \"When [your] big victory is that you didn't have to apologize as part of the $16m settlement you're paying for doing absolutely nothing wrong—and, in fact, operating by standard editorial procedures—then maybe you lost,\" Stein posted. Ex-NBC News reporter Joshua Johnson said many of the CBS programs he respected were dishonored by Paramount's \"cowardice, greed and stupidity.\" \"It’s stunning how quickly corporate media is burning itself to death. Just disgusting,\" Johnson wrote before continuing in a follow-up post. \"And what did @CBSMornings lead with today? Weather! That’s like finding out you’ve been disowned one night, and when you sit down to breakfast the next day all you say is, 'How about that rain, huh?'\" Johnson added, \"This is existential. MAKE NOISE ABOUT THIS.\" \"Pod Save America\" co-host Dan Pfeiffer reacted to the settlement as well, writing, \"Media companies must now pay tribute to the President for the privilege of continuing to exercise their First Amendment rights. Great stuff.\" The Freedom of the Press Foundation slammed the settlement on X as well, calling the decision by Paramount \"spineless.\" \"Tragic. Heartbreaking. What a major disappointment. Wow,\" journalist Maria Shriver wrote. TRUMP, CBS PARENT COMPANY SET FOR MEDIATION IN $20 BILLION ’60 MINUTES’ LAWSUIT Ex-CNN journalist Jim Acosta said it was \"horrible news.\" Liberal journalist John Harwood, another former CNN figure who now writes for the far-left site Zeteo, called it \"repulsive.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE \"The Left Hook\" substack writer Wajahat Ali called for people to cancel their Paramount+ descriptions.

No. But I tried to take care of Alaska’s interests.” \n\nThat quote went on to be pilloried by numerous Democrat-aligned figures on Twitter and other media platforms.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson is showing no interest in going back to the drawing board, however, even in the face of threats to vote against the legislation from nearly two dozen House Republicans.\n\n“We knew we would come to this moment.

It’s not a House bill, it’s not a Senate bill, it’s the American people’s bill.”\n\nBut even with Johnson’s latest rollover to the party’s leader, Murkowski was due to become Washington’s target for scorn after the Senate’s vote. Her support for the measure came after an intense lobbying campaign that involved Alaska-specific sweeteners added to the package, including a delay on penalties for the work requirements she and her Republican colleagues supported in the bill.\n\nDemocrats and even some Republicans, like Republican no-vote Sen. Rand Paul, accused her of attempting to soften the effects of the legislation’s deep spending cuts in her state, while hanging the rest of the country out to dry.\n\nThe Kentucky libertarian, commenting to reporters after the bill’s passage, said that Murkowski wanted a “bail-out” for Alaska at the expense of the rest of the country, a remark that earned NBC’s Ryan Nobles a 10-second stare-down from Murkowski when Nobles repeated the quote to her.\n\nMurkowski then told Nobles she would make “no excuses” for fighting for her state. She maintained in multiple gaggles with reporters over Tuesday that Alaska’s intensely rural population led to a set of unique circumstances that needed to be addressed around work requirements and food stamp eligibility.\n\nThat explanation didn’t satisfy the other side of the aisle.\n\n“She’s a cheap date,” quipped Rep. Jim McGovern during a session of the House Rules Committee on Tuesday, commenting about a tax break for whaling that he inferred was included to win over Murkowski.\n\nThe national Democratic Party meanwhile set to work on a particularly aggressive effort to highlight Murkowski’s criticism of the bill, which she raised again and again in comments to reporters after the vote.\n\nMurkowski, however, is not up for re-election until 2028 — and doesn’t represent the most appealing of a target for the party anyway, given her centrist bent and Alaska’s political landscape. As a result, Democrats are focusing on another central figure in the GOP effort to get the “big, beautiful bill” to Donald Trump’s desk — his top deputy and link to Congress, Vice President JD Vance.\n\nThough he only served in the Senate for a fraction of one term before joining Trump’s presidential ticket (in both cases with Donald Trump Jr.’s backing), Vance maintains strong ties within the GOP Senate caucus and was hard at work leaning on them over the weekend, according to Republican senators.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, an ally of Vance who spoke to reporters after the vote Tuesday, referred to the vice president as the White House’s “closer” on the budget deal.\n\nA number of prominent Democrats used social media posts to highlight Vance’s role as the tiebreaker in Tuesday’s vote, including two men thought to be eyeing possible runs for president in 2028: Pete Buttigieg and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California. \n\nButtigieg said in March that he thought seriously about running for Senate in 2026, but decided against it.
