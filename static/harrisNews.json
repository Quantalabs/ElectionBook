The strong show of bipartisan support came days after the House passed the measure, known as the Enhanced Presidential Security Act, without any opposition in a 405-0 vote. The bill would give former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris the same level of protection provided to Biden. At only three pages long, the bill gives broad discretion to the Secret Service on how to apply measures to reach that level. It comes the same month as an apparent second attempt to assassinate Trump. Biden called on Congress to act last week, saying that the Secret Service “needs more help.” The Trump campaign, the Harris campaign and the Secret Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Senate passage of the bill. The Enhanced Presidential Security Act was introduced in the House by Reps. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., and Ritchie Torres, D-N.Y. Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., brought the legislation to the Senate floor. Following the House vote on Friday, Acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe said during a press conference that Trump is already receiving “the highest levels of secret service protection.” He added that Trump was receiving everything Biden is “with respect to Secret Service.” At the same time, Rowe said the agency needs “a paradigm shift” in its approach to protecting presidents. The passage of the bill comes as the House mulls a broader spending measure that includes a plan to provide an additional $231 million for the Secret Service. It also comes a day after Trump accused the Justice Department of “downplaying” the alleged assassination plot against him in West Palm Beach, Florida. Trump was previously shot in the ear during an assassination attempt at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON — The Senate unanimously passed legislation Tuesday to boost Secret Service&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Congress Approves Bill to Enhance Security for Presidential Candidates Following Alleged Plot Against Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/congress-approves-bill-to-enhance-security-for-presidential-candidates-following-alleged-plot-against-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/rewrite-this-title-Congress-passes-bill-to-boost-presidential-candidate.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:36:00","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.135},{"id":257295460,"title":"From India to S Korea, people peacefully deciding their future through elections this year: Biden","text":"UNITED NATIONS, Sep 24 : Citing the example of India, US President Joe Biden on Tuesday said that the world witnessed people across the globe “peacefully” choosing their future through elections held this year. “We’ve seen citizens across the world peacefully choosing their future, from Ghana to India to South Korea – nations representing one-quarter of humanity will hold elections this year alone,” Biden said as he addressed world leaders from the podium of the UN General Assembly Tuesday. Delivering his last address as President of the United States, Biden told the General Debate of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly “it is remarkable, the power of we the people, that makes me more optimistic about the future than I’ve ever been since I was first elected to United States Senate 1972.” The Indian general elections, conducted in seven stages over six weeks, concluded in June this year and were the largest electoral exercise in the history of mankind, with 650 million voters exercising their franchise and bringing the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi back to power for a historic consecutive third term. Prime Minister Modi, addressing the UN’s Summit of the Future Monday, also referred to the gigantic Indian elections, describing them as the “largest election in human history.” On behalf of India, the world’s largest democracy, and 1.4 billion Indians, Namaskar to all of you. In the largest election in human history held recently in June, the people of India have given me the opportunity to serve them, for a third consecutive term,” Modi said.

Biden announced earlier this summer that he will not seek re-election as President of the United States, passing on the baton to Harris, who has made history as the first woman of Indian and Black heritage to be nominated as an American presidential candidate. “This summer, I faced a decision whether to seek a second term as President. It was a difficult decision. Being president has been the honour of my life. There’s so much more I want to get done. As much as I love this job, I love my country more. I decided, after 50 years of public service, it’s time for a new generation of leadership to take my nation forward. My fellow leaders, let us never forget, that some things are more important than staying in power.

Ryan Routh, 58, was hit with the charge in federal court Tuesday morning, a little over a week removed from the failed assassination on the prominent political candidate. He had already been facing two gun-related charges after cops said he pointed a rifle through a fence at Trump’s golf club in West Palm Beach, where he is now being tried. The indictment came during the suspect’s second day in court, after the Justice Department asked a grand jury on Monday to approve the more serious attempted assassination charge, which carries a max sentence of life in prison. Routh previously faced 20 years, after staking out the aspiring two-term president for 12 hours, feds said. ‘Violence targeting public officials endangers everything our country stands for, and the Department of Justice will use every available tool to hold [Routh] accountable for the attempted assassination,’ said AG Merrick Garland of the updated indictment. ‘The Justice Department will not tolerate violence that strikes at the heart of our democracy, and we will find and hold accountable those who perpetrate it. ‘This must stop.’ Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco issued her own statement, in which she painted the suspect’s alleged actions as ‘a direct attack on our democracy. ‘Political violence has no place in this country – not then, not now, not ever,’ she said in a press release Tuesday afternoon. ‘The charges today reflect the Department’s continued resolve to deploy every available resource to ensure public officials remain safe and to hold accountable those who target public officials to the fullest extent of the law.’ FBI Director Christopher Wray also responded to the development, remarking in his own statement how the charge of assassinating a presidential candidate ‘strikes at the very heart of our democratic system.’ ‘The FBI is continuing our investigation into this alleged plot and will use the full weight and resources of the FBI to uncover and provide as much information as possible about what led to the events in West Palm Beach,’ Wray said. ‘In our country, we have to hold accountable people who resort to violence.’ As the charge was announced, Trump continued to campaign in Georgia Tuesday, speaking at the Johnny Mercer Theatre Civic Center in Savannah. This comes as polls show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris in a tight race ahead of the looming election, where states like Georgia will likely prove pivotal in the selection of the next president. Trump’s focus in Savannah seemed to surround promises to lower taxes and putting a premium on American manufacturing. He also spent much of his 90 minutes speech criticizing Harris’s policies, as several experts have suggested he focus on his rival’s track record in the current administration when it comes to he border and the economy. During that span, Trump did not mention the second attempt on his life, or the hearing that was occurring just a few hundred miles away in the Sunshine State. Prosecutors there said Routh spent a month in South Florida stalking the former commander-in-chief, with cell phone data putting him near the golf course and Trump´s Florida residence at Mar-a-Lago multiple times within that span. He was also found with a handwritten list of dates and venues where Trump spoke or was expected to appear, the indictment revealed – detailing how a Secret Service agent opened fire after discovering the gun poking through a fence while searching the golf course ahead of Trump’s round. This caused Routh to flee, prosecutors said – explaining how he was then arrested within an hour, along a stretch of nearby highway. Feds also produced a chilling letter he penned admitting he failed in trying to take the life of the former president, where the suspect also offered $150,000 for anyone who could ‘finish the job’. ‘This was an assassination attempt on Donald Trump but I failed you,’ a section of the note released by the Department of Justice on Monday and obtained by DailyMail.com read. ‘I tried my best and gave it all the gumption I could muster. It is up to you now to finish the job; and I will offer $150,000 to whomever can complete the job.’ It was addressed to ‘the world’ and accused Trump of ‘end[ing] relations with Iran unsuccessfully. In other court filings, feds wrote how the gunman was able to get near Trump on his Florida golf course because he does not have to same security detail as a sitting president – as was the case in Butler, Pennsylvania, on July 13. Routh, meanwhile, has yet to enter a plea. His lawyers sought to have him released on bond ahead of his trial but were unsuccessful. Prosecutors have alleged that months before the incident, Routh dropped off a letter to an unidentified person alluding to ‘an assassination attempt on Donald Trump.’ He was also convicted of unspecified felonies in North Carolina in December 2002 and March 2010, feds said Tuesday – adding that the FBI is investigating the case. The US Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida and National Security Division’s Counterterrorism Section are prosecuting, with the charges now finalized.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe man accused of attempting to assassinate former President Donald Trump on&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh accused of attempting to assassinate Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/58-year-old-ryan-wesley-routh-accused-of-attempting-to-assassinate-trump/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/09/24/23/90057871-13888131-image-m-14_1727218052137.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:31:57","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.49},{"id":257295116,"title":"Haitian nonprofit in Springfield, Ohio, files charges against Trump, Vance over pet-eating claims","text":"Sept. 24 (UPI) -- A Haitian nonprofit in Ohio filed criminal charges Tuesday against former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, for \"baseless fearmongering\" in their unsubstantiated claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield are \"eating their neighbor's pets.\" The leader of Haitian Bridge Alliance filed the charges in Clark County Municipal Court under a state statute that allows private citizens to file criminal charges. Their \"lies have harmed the Springfield community, and their lies have violated criminal law,\" the group said in a press release. Among the charges against the running mates are making false alarms, disrupting public service, committing telecommunications harassment, committing aggravated menacing and violating the prohibition against complicity, according to the Chandra Law Firm, which is representing the group. During this month's presidential debate, Trump claimed, \"In Springfield, they're eating dogs, the people that came in. They're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people who live there.\" Vance has made similar claims and, when confronted, told CNN, \"If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.\" Local officials in Springfield and the city's mayor have flatly denied claims of pet-eating, saying they have received no credible reports substantiating the rumors. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine called the claims a false \"piece of garbage\" as he acknowledged the immigration surge has caused other problems for the city. \"What we know is that the Haitians who are in Springfield are legal. They came to Springfield to work. Ohio is on the move, and Springfield has really made a great resurgence with a lot of companies coming in,\" DeWine told ABC's \"This Week.\" DeWine confirmed he has sent money and additional state troopers to Springfield to handle a surge in healthcare issues and traffic problems that he attributed to the exploding migrant population. A bomb threat on Sept. 15 at Clark State College in Springfield forced officials to close the campus and hold classes virtually for the rest of the week. The Haitian nonprofit blamed Trump and Vance for the ongoing disruptions. \"The Haitian community is suffering in fear because of Trump and Vance's relentless, irresponsible, false alarms and public services have been disrupted. Trump and Vance must be held accountable to the rule of law,\" said lead counsel Subodh Chandra. \"Anyone else who wreaked havoc the way they did would have been arrested by now.\" Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded to Tuesday's charges. He said, \"President Trump is rightfully highlighting the failed immigration system that Kamala Harris has overseen, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants pouring into communities like Springfield and many others across the country.\"","summary":"A Haitian nonprofit in Ohio filed criminal charges Tuesday against former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen.

The poll, conducted from September 9-16, finds that Trump and Harris are locked at 47 percent among 692 likely voters when third-party candidates are included in the fray. One percent backs Libertarian Chase Oliver, while the Green Party’s Jill Stein does not secure a percent of support, and three percent are undecided. Trump leads Harris with both independents and Hispanic voters. Independents break for Trump over Harris by a 47 percent to 41 percent margin, while 49 percent of Hispanics prefer Trump and 44 percent support Harris. The poll gauged a strictly two-way race between Trump and Harris among the likely voters, finding Harris has a razor-thin edge on this front at 48 percent to 47 percent. Trump holds a five-point lead with independents and a three-point lead with Hispanics in this statistical tie. Noble Predictive Insights also sampled 812 registered voters, a less reliable data point considering likely voters are registered voters who plan to cast a ballot. In the four-way race, Harris has a 46 percent to 43 percent advantage over the 45th president with registered voters, while Oliver garners one percent and Stein does not procure a point. Three percent do not like any candidates, while six percent are unsure who they will back. Trump has a two percent advantage with independents, while Harris leads with Hispanics by two percent. Harris continues to hold the three-point edge in the hypothetical head-to-head race among registered voters. She draws 48 percent of support to Trump’s 45 percent. Seven percent are unsure. Harris’s leads in both iterations of the registered voter samples are within the ± 3.44 percent margin of error. The margin of error for likely voters is ± 3.72 percentage points. The poll further finds that likely voters trust Trump more on crucial issues, including immigration and inflation. On immigration, voters trust Trump over Harris by a 55 percent to 39 percent margin. They also believe Trump is better suited to handle inflation, at 47 percent to 44 percent.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are tied in the swing state of Nevada, according to a Noble Predictive Insights poll published Tuesday.\n\n\nThe post Poll: Donald Trump, Kamala Harris Locked in Dead Heat in Nevada appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2024/09/24/poll-donald-trump-kamala-harris-locked-in-dead-heat-in-nevada/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/09/Donald-Trump-Kamala-Harris-Tied-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:21:20","author":"Nick Gilbertson","authors":["Nick Gilbertson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.219},{"id":257295008,"title":"Stop risky research, Congress dodges hard decisions and other commentary","text":"Science desk: Stop Risky Research! The Risky Research Review Act, now before the Senate, “could finally require independent oversight” around risks like gain-of-function research, note Bryce Nickels & Jay Bhattacharya at RealClearPolitics. “The bill would create an independent advisory panel” charged with “reviewing all federally funded research with the potential to increase the transmissibility or virulence of any potential pandemic pathogen.” “The stakes could not be higher,” as such research “likely caused the COVID pandemic, which led to 7 million deaths — 1 million of them in the United States.” It also “offers a rare opportunity for compromise and bipartisanship.” Good: Time to eliminate “the subjective discretion that previous policies provided to funding agency officials like Anthony Fauci.” “The life of every human being on the planet is at stake.” Libertarian: Congress Dodges Hard Decisions “A continuing resolution (C.R.) is the best that Congress can muster,” groans Reason’s Jack Nicastro, when it comes to funding the federal government. “It’s pretty much guaranteed that Congress won’t pass a single appropriations bill by October 1,” the official deadline to pass all of them, which it hasn’t managed since 1997. This year lawmakers haven’t even passed legislation funding “the salaries of congressional offices and funds the security and maintenance of the Capitol, never mind the rest of the federal government.” In budget-making, “there are no solutions; only trade-offs” and “the recurring failure to pass a budget shows that no one in Congress — and few in Washington, D.C. — seem to have any desire to make hard decisions.” Conservative: Harris’ Socialist Program Kamala Harris’ “major policy proposals are almost identical to those promoted by the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA),” smirks Merrill Matthews at The Hill. For example, the “socialists want to add seats to the U.S. Supreme Court (court packing) and impose term limits on the justices,” which “Harris and most Democrats are pushing” through “SCOTUS reforms.” The DSA also “wants to ‘defund the police’ and ‘free all incarcerated people,’ ” while Harris in the past “supported the ‘defund’ movement and eliminating bail for some crimes.” And “under the topic of ‘Health Justice’ the DSA supports Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) Medicare for All bill,” which Harris co-sponsored. The “only major difference” here is “DSA members aren’t trying to hide their socialist beliefs; Harris is.” Eye on Pa.: Bob Casey’s Anti-Biz Bull Senate candidate Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) “earned a Bronze Star in Iraq” and “held senior positions at the Treasury Department and National Security Council before going on to become CEO of one of the world’s premier hedge funds,” but Sen. Bob Casey (D) is trying to use “his experience as a businessman against him,” fumes The Wall Street Journal’s William McGurn. Casey ads lean on “a larger caricature of business as the bogeyman responsible for all our ills,” e.g. blaming inflation “not on government overspending but on predatory businesses.” “Nowhere does Mr. Casey even hint that it is American business and not the government that provides the jobs a healthy society needs and the goods and services people want.” Media watch: Journos Embrace Ignorance “A new type of journalist” today “wants less, rather than more, information about” a major presidential candidate, marvels the Washington Examiner’s Byron York. Notably, MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle recently asserted on the Bill Maher show that “Kamala Harris is not running for perfect,” and “we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is, and the kind of threat he is to democracy.” That, says York, means that expecting “the leading candidate for president of the United States” to submit “to scrutiny about her policy positions is an unreachable state of perfection.” Worse, other big-name journos soon agreed with Ruhle. No wonder Harris dodges: “She has a group of journalists on her side who actively do not want her to answer more questions.” “When it comes to where Harris stands, they don’t want to know.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"The Risky Research Review Act, now before the Senate, “could finally require independent oversight” around risks like gain-of-function research, note Bryce Nickels &amp; Jay Bhattacharya at RealClearPolitics.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/24/opinion/stop-risky-research-congress-dodges-hard-decisions-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/dr-anthony-fauci-speaks-presentation-84247982-e1727214760168.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:21:01","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":257295024,"title":"Whoopi Goldberg Tells Chiefs Fans Blaming Taylor Swift for Travis Kelce’s Performance to ‘Grow Up’","text":"The Kansas City Chiefs are 3-0 so far this NFL season, but some fans are still disappointed with tight end Travis Kelce‘s performance at the Atlanta Falcons game Sunday (Sept. 22). With some of them finding a way to blame it on his superstar girlfriend, however, Whoopi Goldberg is speaking up in Taylor Swift‘s defense. On the latest episode of The View Tuesday (Sept. 24), the talk show host cut right to the chase. “They apparently forgot that they won a Super Bowl last year with [Kelce], and [he and Swift] were just as tight then as they are now,” she said. “Grow up, y’all. Stop putting this on her. Your team is fine, your team is doing well. Shut up.” Though Kelce indeed had a quiet game on Sunday night, notching four receptions for 30 yards and no touchdowns in a nail-biting finish against the Falcons, the Chiefs were still able to win 22-17. Swift was not in attendance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium Sunday, but she has been present at Kansas City’s first two home games of the season. “She wasn’t even at the game,” pointed out cohost Sunny Hostin. “Is she supposed to play the game too? “I also love how we’re acting like Taylor Swift is like a magic 8 ball,” added cohost Alyssa Farah. “She can’t magically affect his game.” The Sister Act star also shared her personal theory as to why Swift is experiencing backlash: her recent endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. “I’m blaming MAGA,” Goldberg said before subtly bringing up Republican opponent Donald Trump. “They’re mad that she is not supporting You Know Who.” Despite the team insisting that Swift’s presence in the Chiefs universe has only been positive, Sunday’s game is hardly the first time football fans have pointed fingers her way. In January, retired Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre suggested that the 14-time Grammy winner would be seen as a “distraction” if Kansas City didn’t win this year’s Super Bowl (they did the following month), and the NFL received so much negativity for its inclusion of Swift in game-day coverage that the league made a statement defending itself last year.

Budget deficits are set to exceed $2 trillion this year — despite relative peace and prosperity — and then surge to $4 trillion within a decade under current policies. For the first time since the end of World War II, the federal debt will top 100% of the gross domestic product. The impending completion of the Biden-Harris administration brings an opportunity to assess their role in these rising deficits. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris surely inherited an economic and fiscal mess. President Trump had already signed legislation and executive orders adding $4 trillion to 10-year deficits before the bipartisan pandemic response added $4 trillion more. Post-pandemic toll That said, as Biden-Harris entered office, the pandemic-ravaged economy was finally reopening and Americans were returning to work. Thus, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) forecast that budget deficits — which had temporarily leaped to $3 trillion — would drop back to the pre-pandemic $1 trillion levels as the pandemic aid expired. Instead, the administration immediately disregarded the advice of even liberal economists and pushed through his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan. Because CBO had calculated that the recovering economy was only $420 billion short of its operating capacity, this $1.9 trillion bazooka wildly overshot its economic stimulus purpose. Consequently, just as economists warned, the excessive stimulus overheated the economy and contributed three more percentage points to an inflation rate that was already rising due to past pandemic stimulus and supply constraints. Overall, this inflation cost typical families more than $10,000. Moreover, the American Rescue Plan’s individual expenditures were largely unnecessary. This pent-up Democratic wish list included $350 billion to bail out state budget deficits that did not actually exist, a bloated union pension bailout, and a decade’s worth of additional federal school funding — all sold to the public with added unemployment benefits, taxpayer rebates and child tax credits. $28.2 TRILLION OWED The Biden-Harris administration’s spending spree did not stop there. It also signed $1.4 trillion in new spending in omnibus appropriations bills, $620 billion in student loan bailouts, $520 billion for new veterans’ benefits, a $440 billion infrastructure law, a semiconductor bill, and $360 billion in new SNAP and health spending forced through by executive order. The offsetting savings promised in the Inflation Reduction Act and Fiscal Responsibility Act are unlikely to materialize. Adding it all up and including the resulting interest costs brings the total to more than $5 trillion in new 10-year costs enacted under President Biden. And that bloated figure would have been even higher had the Supreme Court not blocked an even larger student loan bailout, and had a Democratic Congress not reached its breaking point and blocked the original “Build Back Better” proposal costing $2.3 trillion. Nearly all of this spending occurred during the first two years of Biden-Harris administration, before inflation-weary voters staged their own intervention and elected a Republican House in late 2022. Thus, instead of the pandemic’s conclusion returning budget deficits to $1 trillion as CBO had projected, the Biden-Harris spending pushed the deficit back up to $2.8 trillion in 2021, and approximately $2 trillion this year. The results are shocking: CBO-projected deficit for the cumulative 2021-2031 period has jumped from $14.5 trillion to $21.3 trillion — reflecting an additional $6.8 trillion in deficits. Last year’s federal spending level (24% of GDP) and budget deficit (7.5% of GDP) were both the largest in American history outside of wars and recessions. The US debt is expected to be $28.2 trillion this year, 100% of the GDP — the highest level since the end of WWII. Since 2021, annual interest costs have nearly tripled, from $352 billion to nearly $1 trillion. The debt held by public is currently $212,600 per household. White House gaslighting Rather than take responsibility for this sea of red ink, the White House gaslit voters by claiming to have reduced budget deficits. President Biden brags that his $2 trillion budget deficits are $1 trillion below the 2020 pandemic peak of $3 trillion. Of course, that 2020 figure was a one-time pandemic anomaly that had been preceded by $1 trillion deficits that were expected to return as soon as the economy reopened and pandemic aid expired. Essentially, the president is treating the previously-scheduled expiration of temporary pandemic spending as his own historic spending cut — and then spending its savings. This gaslighting was rebuked by the fact checkers at the Washington Post with a rare “Bottomless Pinocchio” rating. Biden’s successor will inherit $2 trillion deficits, soaring interest costs, and Social Security and Medicare’s trust funds approaching insolvency. Truly a dismal fiscal record that leaves Washington closer to a debt crisis. Brian Riedl is a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute.

When cloture is invoked, 60 votes are needed in order to move a bill to the floor for an actual up-or-down vote. And because the Senate is so closely divided, this means cloture is often used to sink legislation unless it's overwhelmingly popular with both parties. According to Tester, changing the process to a \"talking\" filibuster would be more fair, as it would require any senator wishing to obstruct a vote to physically stand on the floor and speak continuously. This process is still occasionally used: Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) became famous in 2010 for a talking filibuster in a failed attempt to block an extension of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts that disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans. “I don’t want to make this thing like the House. We shouldn’t allow one person to stop this,” Tester said. “Make them talk. If they quit talking, vote.” Tester's promise to oppose eliminating the filibuster could mean he becomes another centrist thorn in the side of a Democratic administration, as Sens. Joe Manchin (I-West Virginia) and Kyrsten Sinema (I-Arizona) were for President Joe Biden. Thanks to their efforts to keep the filibuster intact, Biden was unable to pass his landmark \"Build Back Better\" bill that would have created universal pre-K education, subsidized child care, allowed for three weeks of paid family leave and allowed Medicare to also cover dental and vision care, among others.

It was a hearing billed as outlining the plan’s “devastating impact on hardworking American taxpayers” and dealing with a wide range of the plan’s proposals — which are extensive in scope and deal with everything from energy policy to education. But the vast majority of the hearing’s time centered around one issue: abortion access, and the dangerous circumstances which abortion bans across conservatives states around the country can leave women facing. It’s hard to fault Democrats for fixating on that part of the plan, given the shocking stories that have emerged from woment stuck waiting for their conditions to worsen before doctors would treat them, afraid of running afoul of legislation banning abortion care except in life-threatening circumstances. But the party could run the risk of overshadowing efforts to highlight other aspects of the plan, like how it represents a path to undoing decades of regulation and policies dealing with the environment and could bring to a halt the US’s efforts to fight climate change. There’s also the blueprint for eroding the independence of the Justice Department, which has alarmed constitutional law and ethics watchdogs. Still, the party’s strategy is inarguably working: An NBC News poll released on Sunday indicates that the “Project 2025” brand is in the absolute furthest depths of unpopularity. More than half of those surveyed — registered voters from a nationwide sample of 1,000 — have a negative view of the policy project, while just 4 percent viewed it positively. “Just six pages into the more than 900 pages of Trump Project 2025 it says, quote, ‘The Dobbs decision is just the beginning,’” Rep Ayanna Pressley warned at the hearing, which was only attended by Democratic members on the party’s Policy & Steering Committee, party leaders and the “Stop Project 2025 Task Force”. On Tuesday, several women who had been denied care until the last possible moment shared those same painful stories the Democrats have been highlighting for weeks. One was Gracie Ladd, who described having to leave her home state of Wisconsin to seek abortion care in Chicago because only one hospital in her entire home state would even consider the procedure necessary to keep her from delivering a baby who would have died in minutes if he was even born alive at all. Ladd said she was told by multiple doctors that her son Connor would have been born in agonizing pain. “I’m angry because in my state, there's no way that I wouldn't be labeled a murderer for making the compassionate choice for my son,” Ladd told the Democratic members. “I'm angry that I had to drive to Chicago to receive abortion care two days in a row with a medical team I had never met, a medical team I did not feel comfortable with ... angry that although I was privileged enough to be able to take time off of work find childcare for my living son and I could travel to Chicago two days in a row, not all women can. What are their options? What do they do in this situation? “But mostly I'm angry that the people who were not even in that ultrasound room with me on the day that I received the worst news of my life want to try to tell me what I can and cannot do when it comes to the medical choice for my body and my son.” Her harrowing tale is one of many that Democrats have centered in recent weeks, which have forced the Trump campaign into a clear defensive position. Donald Trump himself remains content to continue espousing his role in the overturning of Roe vs Wade, but has been forced to repeatedly fight back against efforts from his own party to expand the fight against abortion rights and stake out positions in favor of exceptions to state-level bans upon which he would previously have avoided commenting entirely. Trump has also sought to repair his image with women by embracing a plan to fund in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatments through either government subsidies or through a private insurance mandate — both prospects that have been unappealing to conservatives in his party. But in general the ex-president has done little to repair the gender gap that is forming between him and Kamala Harris, and much of his response to criticism of conservative policies outlined in Project 2025 has been to deny his involvement or connections to the plan entirely. NBC’s poll — if accurate — shows Harris up more than 20 points among women nationally. A victory on those margins would be proof of a massive divide growing in American society among the gender lines, though one more pronounced among older and whiter communities.","summary":"Democrats stick the knife in as new poll indicates just 4% of registered voters see Project 2025 in positive light","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/project-2025-democrats-hearing-abortion-b2618400.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/09/24/23/GettyImages-2170792306.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Xc45yv1I-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:11:03","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.266},{"id":257295408,"title":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Set Competing TV Town Halls for October","text":"Donald Trump and Kamala Harris will appear in separate town halls hosted by TelevisaUnivision just days apart next month. The two presidential hopefuls have set their town halls for early October. Trump’s town hall (“Los Latinos Preguntan … Donald Trump Responde”) will be Tuesday, Oct. 8, at 10 p.m. ET from Miami, while Harris’ town hall (“Los Latinos Preguntan … Kamala Harris Responde”) will be Thursday, Oct. 10, at 10 p.m. ET from Las Vegas. The in-person audiences for both televised town halls will largely be comprised of undecided Hispanic voters who will have the opportunity to ask the candidates questions. “Noticias Univision serves as a two-way bridge: we bring every voice to our community while conveying the concerns of Latinos to those in power,” Daniel Coronell, president of Noticias Univision, said on Tuesday. “There are more than 36 million Hispanics eligible to vote in the U.S., making them the largest minority in the country, with the power to influence the outcome of the race for the White House and the future of the nation.” Anchor Enrique Acevedo will moderate both town halls. They’ll both air with Spanish-language translation on Univision and stream on ViX’s Noticias 24/7 channel and will also be available in English on Noticias Univision’s YouTube channel. Plus, this might be the last time voters get anything close to resembling a real debate before Election Night. Although Harris agreed to a second debate hosted by CNN that would take place Oct. 23, Trump has continued to refuse the invitation. “Vice President Harris is ready for another opportunity to share a stage with Donald Trump, and she has accepted CNN’s invitation to a debate,” Harris’ spokesperson Jen O’Malley Dillon said in a previous statement. “Donald Trump should have no problem agreeing to this debate. It is the same format and setup as the CNN debate he attended and said he won in June, when he praised CNN’s moderators, rules and ratings.” Trump’s stance on not appearing for a second debate with Harris hasn’t changed since it was unanimously agreed — by every news outlet but Trump himself — that he lost the first one. He claimed at a North Carolina rally on Saturday that Harris “wants to do a debate right before the election with CNN because she’s losing badly.”","summary":"Both candidates’ events will be hosted by TelevisaUnivision just days apart\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris and Donald Trump Set Competing TV Town Halls for October appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/kamala-harris-donald-trump-town-halls-televisa-univision/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Kamala-Harris-and-Donald-Trump.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:05:51","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.087},{"id":257295144,"title":"Springfield, Ohio, Haitian group files citizen criminal charges against Trump and Vance over rumors","text":"Springfield shot to national prominence after Vance and Trump focused attention on the roughly 20,000 Haitian immigrants who landed in the town, which had a previous population of 58,000. Most famously, Vance and then Trump repeated rumors that Haitian immigrants were eating local pet cats and dogs. The Haitian Bridge Alliance claimed Trump and Vance put the community in danger. Its lawyer, Subodh Chandra, said the group was invoking its private-citizen right to file charges after the local prosecutor’s inaction, the Associated Press reported. The charges include disrupting public services, making false alarms, telecommunications harassment, aggravated menacing, and complicity. Chandra is asking the Clark County Municipal Court to issue arrest warrants for Trump and Vance. In a statement, she attempted to pin bomb threats against schools and local buildings against Trump and Vance. “If it were anyone else other than Trump and Vance who had done what they’ve done — wreak havoc on Springfield, resulting in bomb threats, evacuated and closed government buildings and schools, threats to the mayor and his family — they would have been arrested by now,” Chandra said. “So, really, the only question is whether the court and then the prosecutors would treat Trump and Vance the way anyone else would be treated. They are not above the law.” Though Chandra and activists have attempted to pin the over 30 bomb threats on Trump and Vance, Gov. Mike DeWine (R-OH) revealed that they originated outside the country. He didn’t disclose which foreign country the threats came from. In a statement to the outlet, Steven Cheung, Trump-Vance campaign communications director, denied any wrongdoing. “President Trump is rightfully highlighting the failed immigration system that Kamala Harris has overseen, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants pouring into communities like Springfield and many others across the country,” he said. Vance, in particular, has defended his statements about claims that Haitian immigrants in Springfield were eating cats, especially during an interview with CNN earlier this month, when he said his constituents have brought over a dozen complaints to him. “Now you ask, ‘Why have I talked about some of the things that I’ve been talking about?’ Let me just say this: my constituents have brought approximately a dozen separate concerns to me,” he said. “Ten of them are verifiable and confirmable, and a couple of them I talk about because my constituents are telling me firsthand that they’re seeing these things.” “So I have two options, Dana, I can ignore them, which is what the American media has done for years to this community, or I can actually talk about what people are telling me,” the Ohio senator added. “And, of course, many of the things that the media says are completely baseless have since been confirmed.” In the same interview, Vance hit back after CNN host Dana Bash appeared to imply that he was responsible for the slew of bomb threats against Springfield before it was made known that the threats originated from outside the country. “Well, what is the implication, Dana? I’d actually love to have this conversation right now live on air. What is the implication when you say, ‘You calling out these problems has caused a bomb threat.’ You accused me of causing a bomb threat,” he said. “Doesn’t that mean you should shut up about the residents of Springfield? Don’t you realize you’re engaged in basic propaganda to silence the concerns of American citizens?” Trump recently announced that he would visit Springfield.","summary":"A Haitian group from Springfield, Ohio, filed citizen criminal charges against former President Donald Trump and Sen.

Russia must be forced into peace","text":"UNITED NATIONS >> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that the war between Russia and Ukraine cannot be calmed by talks alone, but that Russia must be forced into peace. Zelensky has sought the support of Western leaders for what he calls a “victory plan” to end the war that began when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of his country in February 2022. Zelensky said the war would end one day but not because “someone got tired of the war” or through a trade with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a reference to proposals that Ukraine cede some territory seized by Russia to settle the conflict. “This war can’t be calmed by talks. Action is needed,” Zelensky said, thanking nations who have provided Ukraine support. “Putin has broken so many international norms and rules that he won’t stop on his own, Russia can only be forced into peace, and that is exactly what’s needed, forcing Russia into peace, as the sole aggressor in this war, the sole violator of the U.N. Charter,” Zelensky said. Ukraine faces an uncertain future. A victory by former President Donald Trump over Vice President Kamala Harris in the Nov. 5 U.S. election could prompt a reset of Washington’s policy on Ukraine, which relies heavily on U.S. military and financial support. Opinion polls show a tight race. Zelensky has said that if his plan is backed by the West, it will have a broad impact on Moscow, including a psychological one that could help compel Putin to end the war diplomatically. Russian U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia spoke up at the meeting to reject the council hosting Zelensky. “Western countries could not refrain from poisoning the atmosphere once again, trying to fill the air time with the hackneyed Ukrainian issue,” Nebenzia said of the meeting. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told the 15-member council that Russia’s war in Ukraine was a clear violation of the founding U.N. Charter. “I strongly condemn all attacks on civilians and civilian facilities — wherever they occur and whoever is responsible. They all must stop immediately,” he said. “And I remain deeply concerned about the safety, humanitarian needs and basic human rights of people residing in occupied areas.”","summary":"UNITED NATIONS >> Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky told the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday that the war between Russia and Ukraine cannot be calmed by talks alone, but that Russia must be forced into peace.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/09/24/breaking-news/ukraines-zelensky-tells-u-n-russia-must-be-forced-into-peace/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/web1_2024-09-24T221738Z_809946878_RC2A7AA5IRRY_RTRMADP_3_UKRAINE-CRISIS-UN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 23:03:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.14},{"id":257294140,"title":"Black-pilled right sees the real threats to Trump’s campaign","text":"A provocative commentary by Cortney Weil appearing at Blaze Media last week warned against “black-pilling.” Weil associated this activity with a misguided right whose members are underestimating Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected. This unhelpful gloom, we are told, might foster despair among those who otherwise would be working energetically for a Republican victory in November. Although Weil warns against pessimism, she doesn’t quite prove that it’s misplaced. She is just upset to hear defeatist attitudes coming from the ranks, even if they’re justified. Moreover, Weil indiscriminately throws together two groups that are spreading this gloom, both of which she identifies with the right. As someone who most emphatically favors the right, I can’t figure out how I’m in the same camp as National Review’s Jim Geraghty. Like others at his magazine, Geraghty earns his bread by attacking Trump while fronting for the now displaced Republican establishment. It is naïve to believe we are not living through a government-driven cultural revolution, one that the media, the culture industry, and American schools are pushing nonstop. Also, unlike Isaac Schorr, who is published in the moderately conservative New York Post, I have not condemned Trump for naming JD Vance as his running mate. I’m delighted that the former president made that choice. In fact, I would be happy to vote for Vance for any office. Weil unfortunately failed to make an important distinction. The honest right expresses pessimism, while those who profit from their association with the old Republican establishment ridicule Trump. These two groups do not overlap, and they certainly don't question Trump's chances of re-election for the same reasons. Although a distributor of black pills, I am nonetheless rooting for Trump and Vance. I even placed a highly visible sign for them on my front lawn and sent several contributions to their campaign. I would be amazed if they won, for all the reasons other pessimistic right-wingers have highlighted. I believe Democrats cheat, which is why they introduce less secure forms of voting and try to give the vote to illegal aliens they deliberately bring into this country to boost their party’s numbers. The left also controls most vital institutions in the United States, especially government administration, the mass media, and educational institutions. Considering the insanely radical positions of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, which they held until only recently, this election shouldn’t even be close. I’m struck by the absence of a mass outcry that Harris has deliberately avoided interviews and policy questions. In a normal society, I would also expect to find very widespread revulsion for the elementary school gibberish in which she speaks. But this is not the case. Kamala’s popularity has been growing, or is at least staying the same, no matter how hard she runs away from questions and no matter how frenetically the media shields her. Further, the inflation of abortion rights into a leading electoral issue should cause one to doubt the Fox News bromide that American voters are reasonable. Since the Dobbs decision that supposedly stripped women of their “reproductive rights,” more abortions have been performed in America than before. That Kamala Harris is now pinning her race on abortion as her “key issue” and is achieving success by doing so should lead us to question the rationality of about half the American electorate. The fact that the Democratic candidates are tied and possibly ahead in a race against a former president who presided over an excellent economy, well-protected borders, and safe streets indicates how powerful the ubiquitous left has become. This is not a temporary blip in our political and cultural situation. It reflects long-established trends in our national life which go back at least as far as the 1960s. It is naïve to believe we are not living through a government-driven cultural revolution, one that the media, the culture industry, and American schools are pushing nonstop. This transformation has influenced our politics profoundly, which makes me hesitate to designate Trump and Vance as the likely victors in the presidential election. Even if “our guys” prevail and their party does better than expected in congressional races, the battle against an all-pervasive left remains. That left may even accelerate the warfare launched during Trump’s first term. Why would anyone think the left’s attempt to wear down its opposition would stop simply because the Republicans won some elections? Trump’s victory would likely lead to well-planned riots and the further weaponization of the administrative state. Meanwhile, the media would be openly calling for Trump’s removal from office by any means. And oh yes, our adversaries would have ample financial resources to achieve their ends thanks to America’s woke capitalist class. Although the other side may be obnoxious, let’s not underestimate their will to gain power nor their resourcefulness in going after what they want. If pointing that out means serving black pills, then I’ll gladly plead guilty.","summary":"A provocative commentary by Cortney Weil appearing at Blaze Media last week warned against “black-pilling.” Weil associated this activity with a misguided right whose members are underestimating Donald Trump’s chances of being re-elected.

Many public institutions have been forced to evacuate and vital local resources were diverted to investigate the barrage of threats to the community.” The Haitian Bridge Alliance are seeking arrest warrants for the following charges: Disrupting public service — by causing widespread bomb and other threats that resulted in massive disruptions to the public services in Springfield, Ohio; Making false alarms — by knowingly causing alarm in the Springfield community by continuing to repeat lies that state and local officials have said were false; Committing telecommunications harassment — by spreading claims they know to be false during the presidential debate, campaign rallies, nationally televised interviews and social media; Committing aggravated menacing in violation — by knowingly making intimidating statements with the intent to abuse, threaten or harass the recipients, including Trump’s threat to deport immigrants who are here legally to Venezuela, a land they have never known; Committing aggravated menacing — by knowingly causing others to falsely believe that members of Springfield’s Haitian community would cause serious physical harm to the person or property of others in Springfield; and Violating the prohibition against complicity — by conspiring with one another and spreading vicious lies that caused innocent parties to be parties to their various crimes. “Like those who falsely shout ‘fire!’ in a crowded theater, Trump and Vance do not color within the lines of the First Amendment,” the document continued. “They commit criminal acts.” The charges filed to the Clark County Municipal Court who are now required to have a hearing on the matter before the affidavit can be dismissed. Representatives for the Trump-Vance presidential campaign did not immediately respond to TheWrap’s request for comment. Trump and Vance have jointly popularized conspiracy theories over the last month that Haitian immigrants in Springfield are kidnapping and eating their neighbors’ pets. “In Springfield, they are eating the dogs. They’re eating the cats,” Trump said during his Sept. 10 debate with Kamala Harris. Such claims have been debunked by local Springfield officials, but Vance and Trump continued to parrot the accusations on television and at campaign events. In an interview with CNN’s Dana Bash, Vance not only continued the narrative but took credit for popularizing the story: “The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes.”","summary":"\"Trump and Vance do not color within the lines of the First Amendment,\" the filing states\n\n\nThe post Haitian Nonprofit Criminally Charges Trump and Vance, Citing ‘Unrelenting Lies’ About Springfield That Led to 33 Bomb Threats appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/trump-vance-criminal-charges-haitian-nonprofit-springfield-harassment/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Untitled-design-2024-07-15T115450.388.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 22:59:39","author":"Jacob Bryant","authors":["Jacob Bryant"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":257294256,"title":"Trump and Harris to Appear at Separate Univision Town Halls With Latino Voters","text":"Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have no plans to debate again, but they will appear at separate town halls with Latino voters on Univision next month.

This is, of course, huge news for the underserved market of the Denchbench. (I assume that's the name of the Judi Dench stan-dom) who haven't yet found the right reason to experiment with an AI voice chatbot.For the rest of us, the logic behind Meta's celebrity collaboration is a little more perplexing.Around this time last year, Meta introduced a different round of celebrity AI assistants as part of Messenger. These chatbots had the faces of celebrities like Kendall Jenner, Mr. Beast, Tom Brady, Snoop Dogg, and more. Strangely, these chatbots used the likenesses of the celebrities, but not their real names. For example, I chatted with \"Billie,\" the character portrayed with an image of Kendall Jenner, whose chat persona was of a helpful sister-like friend.For the celebrity-faced AI assistants, Meta reportedly paid as much as $5 million over two years — for six hours of work sitting in a studio. The deal didn't seem to work out too well for Meta. The chatbots were discontinued by August, less than a year after their launch.So why is Meta using the celebrity AI playbook again if it apparently crashed and burned last time?Maybe last year's chatbots weren't a failure by some metrics. Sure, people didn't seem interested in sticking around talking to fake Tom Brady, but maybe the goal was to get enough people to try using an AI chatbot just one time — and the celebrity gimmick worked for that.Or maybe Meta just has a really strange relationship with the concept of celebrity: It's not a brand like Doritos that uses celebrities in Super Bowl ads or a fashion house where an actress is the face of a perfume. Instagram has been so embedded in the concept of fame and celebrity for the last decade that it's impossible to imagine Meta and famous people existing without each other (whereas I can imagine Doritos getting along just fine).When Meta's Threads launched in the summer of 2023, a real tension appeared: Big, A-list celebrities — the kind who hadn't used Twitter in years — suddenly flocked to the new platform, bringing big follower counts with them. But most of those celebrities went silent after a day or two, perhaps realizing that a text-based medium wasn't really their jam. A few months later, Meta rolled out a program to give cash bonuses to reality stars in exchange for posting on Threads.When Taylor Swift released her latest album, she did post to Threads, where Mark Zuckerberg enthusiastically posted to welcome her. There was even a custom sparkle effect made for users when they typed her album name. But after Meta rolled out the welcome mat for the star, she never posted again on Threads.And recently, when Swift made her announcement supporting Kamala Harris, she did it only on Instagram — not even a cross-post to the platform's text-native cousin (for good reasons, as my colleague Peter Kafka explains).There have been other flops in the celebrity-Meta-ad world. In 2019, Kim Kardashian and Jennifer Lopez, two celebrities whose endorsements usually aren't cheap, starred in three TV spots to promote the Facebook Portal. The Portal was discontinued in late 2022.So, Meta relying on celebrity voices for its AI products feels a little odd to me. Meta's products are usually really good at selling themselves because people love to use them. Celebrities even use them — without getting paid!But reuniting the cast of \"Modern Family\" for a WhatsApp ad suggests Meta might be using celebs to reach normies who might not typically be using AI or WhatsApp. And with these latest AI assistant voices, Meta is not going with the hottest Gen Z influencers; it's using Judi Dench, after all.I mean, at least Meta didn't \"accidentally\" hire a soundalike of a well-known celebrity to be the voice for an AI companion like, uh, some other AI competitors. Could be worse!Perhaps it's just that AI is still a little scary and impersonal, and Meta execs think putting a celebrity face — or voice — to it will help make it feel more accessible. Oddly, the ability of AI to impersonate celebrities is one of the things I think many people fear about the technology. But, ah well.My final guess as to Meta's play here is that these decisions come from somewhere deep inside the company, perhaps a decision based on an executive's instinct about what will pop, mixed with some data from the marketing team. I'm sure many meetings were held!I still hold on to my personal pet theory: Yann LeCun is a frothing fan of \"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\" franchise and demanded the Dame.","summary":"Why does Meta need celebrities like John Cena and Dame Judi Dench to push its AI products?

In one of multiple last-ditch efforts to shore up a Trump victory, leaders in the national GOP attempted to change the way that Nebraska allocates its Electoral College votes. Currently, the state is a rare example of a “hybrid” system, where different parts of the state can award electoral votes to a candidate based on how locals vote. The state reliably votes Republican, but the Omaha area represents a “blue dot” that sometimes gives an electoral vote to Democrats—a vote that may prove decisive for Kamala Harris in a close race. Trump’s allies tried to foreclose this option. In Nebraska last week, Senator Lindsey Graham spoke with lawmakers and advocated changing the process so the state would give all of its electoral votes to a single candidate—most likely Trump, considering the makeup of the state. Yesterday, Republican State Senator Mike McDonnell, on whom the future of the change hinged, announced that he would not support the measure: “After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change,” he said in a statement. McDonnell’s decision, which he suggested was final, effectively halts the initiative. Had it not been for this lawmaker breaking with the wishes of fellow Republicans both in and out of state, Trump and his allies could have succeeded in rolling out a substantive change at this late point in the race. Such Republican machinations in this cycle are not isolated to Nebraska—and Trump’s allies are finding more traction altering election rules in other states. The “sheer volume of litigation we’re seeing just two months before Election Day … is far from the norm,” Megan Bellamy, the vice president of law and policy for Voting Rights Lab, a nonpartisan voting organization, told me via email, citing examples of Republican-led litigation related to voting lists in Arizona and North Carolina and mail ballots in Pennsylvania (all swing states). Last Friday, a controversial rule was passed in Georgia—the state in which Trump is facing an indictment for alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election—that would require election workers to hand-count ballots after the polls close, a process usually reserved for a recount. As my colleague Elaine Godfrey explained last week, Donald Trump sees the “new far-right majority” on Georgia’s state board as an extension of his own campaign, referring to them as his “pitbulls” for victory. States generally have the authority to administer federal elections as they wish, and officials tinkering with state election law for a variety of reasons is nothing new. In the months leading up to the 2020 election, many states made quick-turn changes to voting rules in an attempt to adapt to pandemic restrictions. The current election season has seen a series of changes from both parties: States whose legislatures are led by Democrats have, by and large, altered rules to make registering and voting easier, and those led by Republicans in various states have added restrictions, including ID laws. Some of the GOP’s latest attempts to change rules in swing states may face legal action. But even for those lawmakers whose efforts prove legal, the reasons not to make last-minute changes to the voting process are both obvious and persuasive: Such moves can make a political party look cynical, confuse voters, and undermine trust. Even rules intended to make the process of voting easier can create uncertainty for voters unfamiliar with the new steps, Jacob Neiheisel, a political-science professor at the University at Buffalo, told me. But “winning” has become more important for Trump’s “core constituency than any kind of appearance of fairness,” Neiheisel said. And much of Trump’s base is already primed to distrust elections: Polling from 2023 showed that nearly 70 percent of surveyed Republicans believed that Joe Biden’s 2020 win was fraudulent. If there’s a chance that changing the rules leads to victory, then the way MAGA Republicans see it, these gambits are worthwhile, Neiheisel suggested. Last-minute changes could also introduce errors or confusion that give pretext to Republicans already setting the stage to cast doubt on the legitimacy of the race if it doesn’t go their way. The new hand-counting policy in Georgia, for example, is “absolutely inducing more potential failure points,” Neiheisel told me. If, say, overtired election workers make minor errors in their hand-counts on Election Night, this could give ammunition to those who seek to deny the results of the election (even if such errors had no bearing on the final outcome). Some election workers and local politicians have attempted to serve as a guardrail against late-stage alterations to the law. But their efforts are not always enough. Trump and his motivated allies are trying to squeeze in changes even as, for many Americans, the election has already begun. Voters abroad and in the military were sent ballots last week, and early in-person voting started in certain states this month. The weeks ahead are a crucial time for candidates to make their most persuasive appeals to voters—but also, it seems, for those determined to bend the outcome to their will.

The gangs are turning neighborhoods into hellholes. Blame insane “sanctuary” laws. The word “sanctuary” sounds charitable, but don’t be fooled. It doesn’t mean welcoming the downtrodden, but actually bars police from sharing arrest information with Immigration and Customs Enforcement so that the agency can take custody of illegal immigrants arrested for violent crimes and deport them. Sanctuary laws, in effect, shield criminals who don’t belong in the United States from removal. Eleven states and some 600 towns and cities, mostly controlled by Democrats, have them. Because of these laws, migrant lawbreakers go through a revolving-door justice system — and end up back on the streets to strike again. Americans have a choice: On Saturday, presidential candidate Donald Trump promised to work with Congress to “end all sanctuary cities . . . across our country.” Or we can choose Vice President Kamala Harris — who has apparently taken a vow of silence on questions of policy. But her record shows that San Franciscans died because of her stance on migrant crime when she presided as the city’s top prosecutor. In 2008 Edwin Ramos, an illegal immigrant from El Salvador, murdered a man and his two sons. Prior to the triple murder, Ramos had a history of juvenile arrests for assault and attempted robbery. Had San Francisco police cooperated with federal immigration authorities, Ramos might have been deported, instead of free to kill. Similarly Rony Aguilera, who came to the US illegally from Honduras, murdered Ivan Miranda in 2008. Aguilera had had several earlier run-ins with police, but he remained in San Francisco, ready to unleash violence. The media have painted a heroic picture of Harris’ career in law enforcement, making claims that she “cracked down on violent offenders” as San Francisco’s district attorney and as California’s attorney general. But the coverage conveniently omits any mention of Ramos, Aguilera and their victims. As a US senator, Harris in 2017 voted against a bill that would have increased penalties for criminals who illegally enter after being deported and commit more crimes. The bill went down to defeat. Two years later, when Harris launched her first campaign for president, she declared that local law enforcement “should not act as federal immigration agents” in response to an American Civil Liberties Union candidates’ questionnaire. As attorney general, she told the ACLU, she had instructed California law-enforcement agencies that “they did not have to comply with ICE detainers” — that is, she encouraged them to ignore federal requests to hold migrant suspects for deportation. These same policies are now causing migrant crime to explode in multiple jurisdictions. Six Colorado counties being menaced by the Venezuelan prison gang Tren de Aragua are suing to overturn state sanctuary laws that prevent local police from cooperating with ICE to send gang members packing. New York’s sanctuary laws have enabled the same gang to set up headquarters in migrant shelters across the five boroughs and terrorize the public without fear of deportation. Crime victims can thank their own woke politicians. Mayor Adams has called for amending the city’s sanctuary laws — but the far-left City Council isn’t budging. Last week, House Republicans offered a bill to withhold federal aid for migrants from sanctuary jurisdictions. Outrageously, Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-Manhattan) opposed it, claiming it would “scapegoat immigrants.” That’s partisan blather: Police estimate that as many as 75% of those arrested for assault and robbery in Midtown Manhattan — Nadler’s district — are recently arrived migrants. On Saturday, Trump pledged to “hunt down and capture every single gang member . . . that is being illegally harbored.” A tall order, but the place to start is allowing local police to cooperate with ICE. That means sanctuary laws must be overturned nationwide. Trump tried to make that happen by executive order in 2017, when he cut federal funding for sanctuary jurisdictions. But the order was hit with a slew of legal challenges from blue-state politicians — and courts including the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that only Congress, not the president, can impose terms on how federal money is spent. If Trump wins in November, he plans to maneuver around those legal roadblocks by asking Congress to pass a law like the one Nadler is railing against. The upcoming elections — for president and for the House and Senate — will determine whether that strategy can succeed. One thing is certain: If Kamala wins, so do the gangs. As Border Czar she let them in, and as president she’d shield them from deportation. Under a Harris presidency, plan to bolt your doors and keep up your guard as you walk around your neighborhood — until it’s no longer walkable at all.

Trump lowered the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% through the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, known as the Trump tax cuts. “Under my plan, American workers will no longer be worried about losing your jobs to foreign nations,” said Trump. “Instead, foreign nations will be worried about losing their jobs to America.” The plan could appeal to Savannah and coastal Georgia residents, in particular. Savannah’s largest manufacturing employer is Gulfstream Aerospace Corporation, whose more than 11,000 employees build jets and aerospace equipment, according to the Savannah Chamber of Commerce. Trump vowed to personally work with Gov. Brian Kemp (R-GA) to expand the Port of Savannah a second time following the first expansion during his administration. “This will happen so fast,” said Trump. “With a world-class port and a world-class workforce, this city will soon become one of the premier export ports anywhere on Earth, tripling and quadrupling traffic.” “We will be able to build ships again. We will be able to build airplanes at a much higher level again,” said Trump. “We will become the world leader in robotics.” Harris’s campaign hosted billionaire businessman Mark Cuban on Tuesday to hit back on Trump’s plan. “Trump’s idea of a 20% across-the-board tax on all imported products is insane,” Cuban said in the podcast. “That is a national sales tax. He wants to impose a tax on American consumers.” The Trump campaign has defended the plan as a way to dramatically stimulate business and create more jobs. Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO) criticized Trump’s approach following the speech and said only Harris had an adequate plan to address the economy. “Kamala will build up our working class, invest in U.S. manufacturing, and deliver for American families,” Hickenlooper wrote in a post to X on Tuesday afternoon. “Trump doesn’t know a tariff is a tax on working Americans.” Kamala will build up our working class, invest in U.S. manufacturing, and deliver for American families.

He’d let our factories shut down. He moved the world backwards. His denial of climate change condemns our future generations to a more dangerous world.” Billionaire and former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg introduced Biden. “I think it’s fair to say no president has done more to push our country forward on climate change, starting on Joe’s first day in office when he brought the U.S. back into the Paris climate agreement,” Bloomberg said. “He has wisely put fighting climate change at the center of his work, strengthening the economy, showing how the two go hand in hand.” Bloomberg was in turn introduced by actress Jane Fonda, who praised him for taking on the coal industry and “f***ing fossil gas.” “Mike’s superpower is bringing people together from different sectors and different fields to solve some of the world’s biggest problems,” Fonda said. During his presidency, Biden said he’d flown over wildfires that in total covered more land than the state of Maryland and toured communities hit by tornadoes and floods that cost billions of dollars in damage. He emphasized that he doesn’t see a conflict between boosting the economy and combatting climate change, saying that “when I think climate, I think jobs … good union paying jobs.” The Inflation Reduction Act had created more than 330,000 clean energy jobs, Biden claimed. The bill includes tax credits for solar panels and energy-efficient appliances, and Biden said private companies have invested nearly $1 trillion in clean energy projects since he took office. “This year, we’ll add more new electric capacity than we have in two decades, and 96% of that will be clean energy,” Biden said. “We’ve quadrupled the development of electric vehicles since I took office. We’re deploying a fleet of clean school buses that will not pollute the air. Our postal service is going fully electric.” Trump has sharply criticized Biden’s electric vehicle push on the campaign trail, saying the initiative will put autoworkers out of jobs in order to make cars that blue-collar workers cannot afford. Republicans have also criticized the Biden administration’s electric school buses. A House committee report found that electric school buses cost nearly four times as much as diesel-powered ones and have a failure rate of up to 20%.

And Michael [Bloomberg], let me go back to you. Your initiatives, your commitment, your vision, your dedication have literally changed the world.

And what on earth do we have to show for Biden’s gargantuan spending sprees? Nothing meaningful, other than elevated prices that continue to punish Americans (even as the White House and its allies in the press coo about softening inflation). Oh, and he did hire tens of thousands of new IRS agents . . . Rewind the tape to early 2021, when Joe and Kam came into office. The economy, devastated by COVID, was starting to put out green shoots, with budget deficits driven up by pandemic-relief spending set to return to normal levels. Well, until Joe pushed through his near-$2 trillion “American Rescue Plan” — which touched off the inflation conflagration, costing typical families more than $10,000. Add in $620 billion in student-loan bailouts, a $440 billion “infrastructure” bonanza, the CHIPS Act, $1.4 trillion in new outlays rushed through in omnibus appropriations bills and so on, and you get some eye-watering results. Like a $6.8 trillion jump in the projected cumulative deficits over the 2021-2031 period, per the Congressional Budget Office. And federal spending in the last year that, at 24% of GDP, is the largest in history outside wars and recessions. The per-household share of Uncle Sam’s debt load? Nearly $213,000. And the Biden team has lied and lied and lied about the fiscal catastrophe, routinely claiming it’s reduced budget deficits. The same playbook Joe & Co. used to first deny and then to shift the blame for inflation. Sadly, our fiscal future is all too clear under a President Harris. We’d get more Biden-level spend-a-thons, slamming taxpayers even more and crushing future generations under an ever-metastasizing debt.

Kennedy Jr. Has a New Plan to Paralyze the Vote Count in a Critical Swing State","text":"Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is taking increasingly bizarre and contradictory positions in his ongoing crusade to inject pandemonium into the 2024 election. Right now the former third-party candidate is asking the U.S. Supreme Court to restore his name to the ballot in New York, asserting a constitutional right to run for president in the state. At the same time, he is asking the Wisconsin Supreme Court to remove his name from the ballot in that state, asserting a constitutional right not to run there. Moreover, because it is too late to print new ballots in Wisconsin, Kennedy is demanding that clerks manually place stickers over his name on some 4 million existing ballots. Election officials say this untested improvisation could jam up voting tabulators, making it impossible to scan ballots in a key swing state on Election Day and requiring a drawn-out hand count instead. That may well be the point: Kennedy’s tactics reflect an evident desire to sabotage the efficient administration of the election and undermine trust in its outcome. He appears eager to aid Republican candidate Donald Trump by acting not as a surrogate but as a chaos agent, sowing confusion and doubt at every turn. At this point, RFK Jr. is running Schrödinger’s campaign, simultaneously seeking and disavowing the presidency in different states. After striving to get his name on the ballot in as many places as possible, Kennedy suspended his third-party run last month, endorsing Trump over Kamala Harris. The former candidate is now trying to take his name off the ballot in battleground states for fear that he might siphon off votes from Trump. Yet he is still fighting to keep his name on the ballot in other states, including New York. It is not entirely clear why Kennedy cares about staying on the ballot anywhere; his overall strategy, however, reflects an intent to destabilize the election and abridge the early voting period, as he did in North Carolina. Kennedy was booted off the ballot in New York in August after a judge found that he had falsely claimed residence in the state on his nominating petition. (Smoking-gun evidence proved that he lied about living as a tenant at the listed address.) Every lower court affirmed that decision, agreeing that the false residence invalidated his candidacy. Yet Kennedy is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to restore his name to the ballot in an emergency order. New York has already begun printing and mailing ballots, so this eleventh-hour change would massively disrupt early voting—but again, as in North Carolina, that seems to be the point. Kennedy’s lead counsel, Jed Rubenfeld, claimed that his client’s exclusion from the ballot condemns New Yorkers to be “irrevocably deprived” of their First Amendment right to support his campaign. This argument is tough to swallow, given that RFK Jr. himself is fighting tooth and nail to ensure that millions of other voters are irrevocably deprived of their ability to support him. He is currently urging the Wisconsin Supreme Court to take his name off the ballot in the state, rehashing the arguments that secured him a victory at the North Carolina Supreme Court earlier this month. Wisconsin officials, who have already printed ballots and begun mailing them out, say it is far too late to remove Kennedy’s name. But the candidate has proposed a work-around: He argues that county clerks should be required to cut out and place a sticker over his name on each ballot—all 4 million of them. The sticker solution is, it turns out, no solution at all, but rather the recipe for a logistical nightmare. Election officials have testified that this scheme threatens to derail the preparation and tabulation of ballots. On the front end, it would require an immense amount of additional work for county clerks, many of whom serve in the role in a part-time capacity, and none of whom has the budget for such extra labor. It would lead to voter confusion, especially since clerks would inevitably place some stickers a few centimeters off by accident, failing to fully occlude Kennedy’s name and accidentally blocking out another. And it would halt the mailing of absentee ballots abruptly and indefinitely, even though they are already going out to voters. Perhaps most ominously, Wisconsin officials warn that RFK Jr.’s proposed fix would also subvert the counting of votes. Multiple clerks have attested that stickers would weigh down ballots, causing tabulators—which are calibrated to the ballot’s precise weight—to reject them. Tabulators may also misinterpret stickers as a voter error, leading the machines to wrongly invalidate legitimate votes. Efforts to reprogram this equipment would be complicated by the fact that many ballots have already been mailed without a sticker, so there would be two different kinds of ballots to tabulate. No one knows what would happen. “My machines might react one way to one that doesn’t have a sticker,” one clerk told Votebeat Wisconsin, “and a different way to one that does have a sticker.” And there is insufficient time to reprogram and test the machines in line with state standards anyway. There’s an even more obvious problem: These adhesives will likely jam up voting tabulators, getting stuck in equipment that was never designed to accommodate them. “All it would take,” another clerk warned, “is a small portion of the sticker to fall off in the scanner to render it unusable for the entirety of Election Day.” Stickers could also adhere to other ballots, ripping them during tabulation and creating detritus that jams the scanners. The company that produces these tabulators has cautioned that its machines are not tested to handle a large volume of ballots with stickers. Adhesives are, in fact, not covered under its warranty or service plan, so county clerks would have to pay to repair all damage to the equipment. All of this evidence of catastrophe points toward one outcome: Many if not all of Wisconsin’s 4 million ballots would have to be counted by hand, a process that is vastly slower and considerably less accurate than machine tallying. Votes would be counted differently in different parts of the state, depending on where the tabulators broke down. And Americans might not know the outcome of the race until weeks after the election, a frightening possibility given that Wisconsin could ultimately decide the presidential election. RFK Jr.’s lawyers responded to these profound concerns with the following: “Does it matter if ballots with stickers on them have not been tested with voting equipment? No. It doesn’t matter.” They added that “we should presume that this can be done” because Wisconsin law allows for it in a single circumstance: the unexpected death of a candidate shortly before an election. As the state has explained, the Legislature believes that the extreme consequences of this solution “may be justified” in that one, unusual situation so that a dead candidate’s name may be replaced with the name of a live candidate. Otherwise, the legislative body has instructed courts and clerks to stay the course when a candidate like RFK Jr. demands a last-minute change. There are, to put it mildly, many reasons to believe that Kennedy is not acting in good faith. The Wisconsin Elections Commission has sought to resolve this dispute expeditiously so that the state can prepare Plan B as soon as possible if it comes to that. Yet RFK Jr.’s lawyers have sought to slow down the process at every turn. When the commission tried to expedite the case to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, for instance, Kennedy’s lawyers opposed the motion, arguing that there was no real rush. They failed, and the state Supreme Court took up the case on Friday, promising a “prompt resolution.” (It also rejected Kennedy’s request for oral arguments, which would pointlessly inject further delay.) Already, the court’s 4–3 liberal majority looks disinclined to take this chicanery seriously. Its actions so far suggest that the justices will not allow RFK Jr. to wreck Wisconsin’s election. The state may receive a reprieve this time around, in part because its citizens have elected a judiciary—unlike North Carolina’s—that won’t put up with such bald-faced interference with democracy. The U.S. Supreme Court is likewise almost certain to reject the ex-candidate’s frivolous bid to get back on the ballot in New York, which would now be impossible to mandate on the ground. This final chapter of Kennedy’s failed campaign should soon come to an ignominious close. But he may have already given Trump exactly what he wanted: yet another bogus excuse to reject the legitimacy and integrity of election results that he does not like.","summary":"His tactics reflect an evident desire to sabotage the efficient administration of the election and undermine trust in its outcome.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2024/09/robert-kennedy-jr-wisconsin-vote-sticker-trump.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/36fa99fe-436c-4635-aaf5-89d123285729.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 22:18:55","author":"Mark Joseph Stern","authors":["Mark Joseph Stern"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.457},{"id":257291938,"title":"Migrant advocate files criminal charges against Trump and Vance over Springfield pet-eating controversy","text":"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — A migrant-advocacy leader who says America’s immigration “system is rooted in anti-Black racism” has filed criminal charges against Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, including two for “aggravated menacing,” over the pair’s comments about Haitians’ food choices in small-town Ohio. Guerline Jozef, on behalf of her group Haitian Bridge Alliance, Tuesday demanded Clark County Municipal Court “issue arrest warrants for both Trump and Vance” for spreading “a false and dangerous narrative by claiming that Springfield, Ohio’s Haitian community is criminally killing and eating neighbors’ dogs and cats, and killing and eating geese.” Ohio law allows private citizens to file criminal charges via affidavit directly to a court, which decides if it will issue warrants, refer the matter to a prosecutor or reject the charges. The small town of 58,000 people has become the center of a political firestorm since Republican vice-presidential candidate Vance tweeted allegations that Haitian migrants are abducting and eating neighborhood pets — allegations Trump amplified in dramatic fashion during his Sept. 10 debate with Vice President Kamala Harris. “In Springfield, they are eating the dogs. The people that came in, they are eating the cats,” the ex-prez said in a moment that went viral. Jozef’s sworn statement alleges six crimes against the GOP’s dynamic duo: Disrupting public service — by causing widespread bomb and other threats that resulted in massive disruptions to the public services in Springfield, Ohio; Making false alarms — by knowingly causing alarm in the Springfield community by continuing to repeat lies that state and local officials have said were false; Committing telecommunications harassment — by spreading claims they know to be false during the presidential debate, campaign rallies, nationally televised interviews, and social media; Committing aggravated menacing in violation — by knowingly making intimidating statements with the intent to abuse, threaten, or harass the recipients, including Trump’s threat to deport immigrants who are here legally to Venezuela, a land they have never known; Committing aggravated menacing — by knowingly causing others to falsely believe that members of Springfield’s Haitian community would cause serious physical harm to the person or property of others in Springfield; and Violating the prohibition against complicity — by conspiring with one another and spreading vicious lies that caused innocent parties to be parties to their various crimes. “The Haitian community is suffering in fear because of Trump and Vance’s relentless, irresponsible, false alarms, and public services have been disrupted,” said Subodh Chandra, Jozef’s lead counsel. “Anyone else who wreaked havoc the way they did would have been arrested by now.” The Republican ticket isn’t fazed by a possible visit from the fuzz, though. “President Trump is rightfully highlighting the failed immigration system that Kamala Harris has overseen, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants pouring into communities like Springfield and many others across the country,” campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told The Post. “President Trump will secure our border and put an end to the chaos that illegal immigration brings to our communities.” Neither the Chandra Law Firm nor the Haitian Bridge Alliance responded to requests for comment. Jozef, a native Haitian who cofounded the San Diego-based alliance, has been an outspoken proponent of black migrants well before the Springfield pet-eating controversy began. Politico named her one of its 40 Most Influential Americans on Race and Immigration in 2022. “We focus on the issues unique to Black migrants and build solidarity and collective movement toward policy change,” Haitian Bridge Alliance’s website says. The group works with “progressive coalitions fighting anti-Blackness” and seeks “to end racist border policies like the Remain in Mexico Policy” and “the border-to-prison-and-deportation pipeline.” The group specifically advocates the expansion of the Temporary Protected Status program — which has brought more than 15,000 people to Springfield from Haiti in just four years. A 28-year-old Springfield woman who spoke with The Post on condition of anonymity said the charges are “totally unfair,” and many residents still believe their pets have been “stolen for an untimely demise.” But she works in the local school district and said the recent attention has been rattling. “It is so incredibly sad to see these kids scared or parents switching to online school because they are afraid to send their children to school,” she said. “And I think that is so unfortunate that people have taken this situation in that direction. It is totally unnecessary to do that. No one deserves to be threatened like that. No one.” Trump has pledged to visit Springfield in person “soon.” Vance has no official plans to join him.","summary":"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio. — Donald Trump and his running mate, Senator JD Vance have now been accused of criminal misconduct by members of the Haitian-immigrant community in Springfield, Ohio. ","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/24/us-news/migrant-advocate-files-criminal-charges-against-trump-and-vance-over-springfield-pet-eating-controversy/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/trump-vance-springfield-criminal-charges-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 22:16:52","author":"Joe Durbin","authors":["Joe Durbin"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.339},{"id":257292178,"title":"Whoopi Goldberg Tells Chiefs Fans Blaming Taylor Swift for Travis Kelce’s Performance to ‘Grow Up’","text":"The Kansas City Chiefs are 3-0 so far this NFL season, but some fans are still disappointed with tight end Travis Kelce‘s performance at the Atlanta Falcons game Sunday (Sept. 22). With some of them finding a way to blame it on his superstar girlfriend, however, Whoopi Goldberg is speaking up in Taylor Swift‘s defense. On the latest episode of The View Tuesday (Sept. 24), the talk show host cut right to the chase. “They apparently forgot that they won a Super Bowl last year with [Kelce], and [he and Swift] were just as tight then as they are now,” she said. “Grow up, y’all. Stop putting this on her. Your team is fine, your team is doing well. Shut up.” Though Kelce indeed had a quiet game on Sunday night, notching four receptions for 30 yards and no touchdowns in a nail-biting finish against the Falcons, the Chiefs were still able to win 22-17. Swift was not in attendance at Mercedes-Benz Stadium Sunday, but she has been present at Kansas City’s first two home games of the season. “She wasn’t even at the game,” pointed out cohost Sunny Hostin. “Is she supposed to play the game too? “I also love how we’re acting like Taylor Swift is like a magic 8 ball,” added cohost Alyssa Farah. “She can’t magically affect his game.” The Sister Act star also shared her personal theory as to why Swift is experiencing backlash: her recent endorsement of Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. “I’m blaming MAGA,” Goldberg said before subtly bringing up Republican opponent Donald Trump. “They’re mad that she is not supporting You Know Who.” Despite the team insisting that Swift’s presence in the Chiefs universe has only been positive, Sunday’s game is hardly the first time football fans have pointed fingers her way. In January, retired Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre suggested that the 14-time Grammy winner would be seen as a “distraction” if Kansas City didn’t win this year’s Super Bowl (they did the following month), and the NFL received so much negativity for its inclusion of Swift in game-day coverage that the league made a statement defending itself last year.

On Tuesday, Senate Republicans blocked a resolution that Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) introduced to guarantee abortion access to protect a pregnant person’s life, including in the nearly two dozen states that have implemented bans or restrictions since the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade. The move followed a pair of reports from ProPublica, published last week, that documented the 2022 deaths of two Georgia mothers, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, who were unable to obtain a routine procedure—a dilation and curettage—to clear unexpelled fetal tissue from their uteruses after taking abortion pills and experiencing rare complications. While Miller died at home, having been scared to go to the hospital after taking abortion pills, ProPublica reported that Thurman died in a hospital after doctors waited 20 hours to perform the necessary procedure, which state law had made a felony with few exceptions. The stories led to widespread condemnation, including from Vice President Kamala Harris, as my colleague Pema Levy covered. “I’m not going to let any of my Republican colleagues off the hook just for saying they care about the life the mother—not if they won’t lift the finger to actually protect women and to actually make clear that emergency care can include abortion,” Murray said on the Senate floor. The essence of the resolution—which states “that every person has the basic right to emergency health care, including abortion care,” and which 40 Democrats co-sponsored—was essentially the argument at issue in the Supreme Court case Moyle v. United States. In that case, decided in June, the justices ultimately allowed emergency abortions to continue in Idaho, where a near-total abortion ban is in effect, but did not rule on whether other state abortion bans conflict with the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, which mandates hospitals provide stabilizing treatment to anyone who needs it. As Murray noted, Thurman’s and Miller’s deaths are likely not the only ones attributable to abortion bans: Maternal deaths in Texas, where a total abortion ban is in place, rose 56 percent—compared to 11 percent nationwide—after its six-week ban was implemented in 2021, NBC News reported last week. “The data in Texas paints a clear, brutal picture of the reality these abortion bans are killing women,” Murray said. Sen. James Lankford (R-Okla.), who objected to Murray’s resolution on behalf of Republicans, responded in the way the right often has to such attacks: by insisting that Democrats are the problem, and by falsely claiming that abortion pills are dangerous—despite the fact that more than 100 scientific studies have affirmed their safety and efficacy, including one published earlier this year that showed them to be just as safe when prescribed virtually and mailed as when prescribed and administered in person. (Several anti-abortion activists on the right have similarly alleged that abortion pills caused Thurman’s and Miller’s deaths, even though—as the ProPublica stories note—complications from the pills are exceptionally rare, and a routine procedure could have likely changed the tragic outcomes.) In insisting that the resolution was unnecessary, Lankford made several other false claims, including that “no state criminalizes miscarriage” (in fact, that’s provably false, and women have been charged with homicide after miscarriages) and that it’s “political rhetoric” from abortion rights advocates like Harris that is to blame for scaring doctors about the repercussions they could face under abortion bans (in fact, it’s Republican legislation—like the Georgia law—that explicitly threatens doctors with fines and jail time if they perform abortions). The truth is, in fact, much simpler than Lankford suggested. As Murray said in response to Lankford’s opposition: “Here in America, in the 21st century, pregnant women are suffering and dying—not because doctors don’t know how to save them, but because doctors don’t know if Republicans will let them.” Senate Republicans on Tuesday also blocked a bill introduced by Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.) that would have appropriated $350 million annually through 2028 to help with travel costs for people who have to travel out of state to access abortion; in his objection, Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.) derided it as an “elective abortion travel slush fund” for “radical abortion groups.” Lest you forget, Senate Republicans also twice blocked a vote on a bill that would have guaranteed IVF access nationwide from coming up for a vote, and in June blocked another bill to guarantee federal access to contraception. All this, keep in mind, is coming from the party whose presidential nominee pledges he’ll make women great again.","summary":"Two women who died in Georgia as a result of the state&#8217;s post-Dobbs abortion ban are, apparently, not enough to make Republicans agree that all Americans should have access to abortion in emergencies.

Smith Memorial Foundation dinner this year. For the past four decades, nominees from the two major political parties have headlined the lively and often humorous Catholic charity event as an effort to show collegiality between partisan lines. Former President Donald Trump, 78, confirmed he will attend, but Harris, 59, opted for battleground state campaigning instead. “We were looking forward to giving the vice president an enthusiastic welcome,” Dolan, 74, said during a press conference Monday. “She speaks very much about high ideals and how it’s good to get away from division and come together in unity and all. “We’re not used to this. We don’t know how to handle it,” he went on. “This hasn’t happened in 40 years, since Walter Mondale turned down the invitation. And remember, he lost 49 out of 50 states. I don’t want to say there’s a direct connection there.” Dolan is set to host the iconic New York Catholic Charities fundraiser that will take place on Oct. 17. Harris felt she needed to “maximize her time in the battlegrounds this close to the election,” according to a campaign official. It’s not entirely clear which state she intends to campaign in instead of attending the esteemed charity dinner. The tradition dates back to John F. Kennedy’s and Richard Nixon’s joint appearance at the dinner in 1960. The event helps raise money for Catholic charities, including efforts to support children. Trump had attended the 2016 alongside his then-rival Hillary Clinton and then partook in the virtual dinner held in 2020 with President Biden, the country’s second Catholic president. Historically, the dinner is a forum for humorous banter and light-hearted political jabs between the two major political rivals during a feisty election cycle. Trump wasted little time throwing shade at the vice president over her plans to skip the feted meal. “It’s sad, but not surprising, that Kamala has decided not to attend. I don’t know what she has against our Catholic friends, but it must be a lot because she certainly hasn’t been very nice to them,” he chided on Truth Social. “Any Catholic that votes for Comrade Kamala Harris should have their head examined.” Dolan indicated that he is still hopeful Harris will reverse course and suggested that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul are “working hard” to “convince her to come.” “We’re not giving up, we hope she’s here,” he stressed. Doland has previously been critical of Democrats, having penned a 2018 Wall Street Journal op-ed titled, “The Democrats Abandon Catholics.” One of the top concerns he cited in the piece was the Democrats’ position on abortion. Harris has vowed to restore a national right to abortion access, while Trump has indicated he’d defer to the states, deviating from the GOP’s past platforms that called for national restrictions. Harris’ decision to forgo the dinner comes against the backdrop of recent polling suggesting that the race between her and Trump is a nail-biter. Harris leads Trump by 2.1 percentage points nationally — the same margin as Clinton eight years ago, according to the RealClearPolitics polling aggregate.","summary":"\"This hasn't happened in 40 years, since Walter Mondale turned down the invitation.

Trump traveled to Savannah, Georgia to lay out his economic vision, but the speech also took some turns. In 82 minutes, he also spoke about the double assassination attempt, the Philadelphia debate, his beef with Oprah Winfrey and exploding hydrogen cars. ‘Under my leadership, we are going to take other countries’ jobs,’ Trump said. ‘Your only worry will be which job to take,’ he promised his supporters to loud cheers. Trump said he would entice companies to produce products in the U.S. by threatening them with tariffs if they refused. ‘I will give you the lowest taxes, the lowest energy cost, the lowest regulatory burden and free access to the best and biggest market on the planet,’ he said. ‘But only if you make your product here in America.’ Trump talked about how he wanted German car companies to become American companies – but that talk eventually segued to his detest of electric cars – though he carved out a compliment for Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who endorsed him. ‘Elon Musk is great. He makes an excellent car. And he endorsed me at a level you wouldn’t believe,’ Trump said. From there, the ex-president warned about the cars of the future – hydrogen-powered vehicles. ‘The new thing – and I’m sure Elon will get it if it’s any good – but it’s got one little problem: it explodes,’ Trump said. ‘Hydrogen. ‘They say the new thing is hydrogen cars. But they’re having a problem. If it explodes you end up about seven blocks away and you’re dead.’ Trump talked about how he wouldn’t allow the Japanese company Nippon to buy the Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, which is currently under review by a U.S. national security panel. And then from there, he spoke a bit about the state of the 2024 race. Trump boasted that he was outworking Harris – and that he won the Philadelphia debate against Harris earlier this month. He spent a lengthy amount of time recalling the two attempts on his life. Trump credited God for being responsible for saving him in Butler, Pennsylvania and said of West Palm Beach, ‘I’m telling you God was watching there too.’ The ex-president also heralded the immigration chart he was looking at in Butler when shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks took his shot. ”I sleep with that chart every night. I kiss it. I love it,’ he said. The audience cheered as the chart was displayed. Trump appeared to fill the Johnny Mercer Theatre Civic Center – a smaller venue than where he usually holds rallies – in downtown Savannah. Savannah is one of Georgia’s blue dots – with the broader Chatham County going for President Joe Biden over Trump 59 percent to 40 percent four years ago. Harris paid a trip to the city in late August. Ahead of Trump’s appearance, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene was among those tasked to warm up the crowd. Greene sported a red dress and cowboy boots and got much louder cheers than other Georgia Republicans, including former Sen. David Perdue, whose 2021 election loss helped tilt the Senate to the Democrats. The congresswoman told the audience that ‘November 5 is a job interview.’ ‘Are we going to hire a woman who has received a government paycheck her entire life – abusing government power?’ Greene asked. ‘Or are we going to hire a successful businessman?’ she said to cheers. ‘The American people are not stupid but the media thinks you are,’ she continued. ‘They want to convince you that Donald Trump is all these nasty things that they have been calling him. Well, all of those nasty names and all of that talk nearly got him assassinated – twice.’ Sharp-shooters were seen walking into the auditorium Tuesday ahead of Trump’s visit, as security has been heightened around the ex-president. Harris plans to deliver her own economic-focused addressed on Wednesday from Pittsburgh. Ahead of Trump’s remarks, the Harris-Walz campaign tapped Mark Cuban to rebuff the GOP nominee’s economic plans. ‘In a nutshell, the vice president, her team, thinks through her policies,’ Cuban said Tuesday morning. ‘She doesn’t just off the top of her head say what she thinks the crowd wants to hear like the Republican nominee.’ Cuban noted that the Harris campaign has a ‘whole policy team’ and when he asks them a question ‘I get back a serious, well-studied response.’ ‘That’s the antithesis of what Donald Trump is doing,’ Cuban said. ‘He says things off the top of his head that tend to often be ridiculous, if not insane.’ Cuban took issue with Trump’s recent threat to tariff John Deere by 200 percent if the company moved to Mexico. The Shark Tank star explained that the net result of such a move would be that Trump would make Chinese manufacturers more competitive against John Deere. ‘You literally face the destruction of one of the most historied companies in the United States of America,’ Cuban said, calling the Trump-proposed policy ‘ridiculously bad and destructive.’ Cuban also mocked Trump’s push to have credit card interest rates capped at 10 percent. ‘Next in the what-the-hell-is-he-thinking list is the 10 percent price cap on credit card interest rates. I mean literally, Bernie Sanders suggested a cap of only 15 percent. right?’ Cuban said. ‘So now you have Donald Trump getting involved in price caps and price controls to a greater extent than self-described socialist Bernie Sanders.’ ‘And I think that just says so much about how far Donald has gone to his socialist and communistic tendencies, right?’ Cuban poked. The billionaire investor said he realized it ‘sounds funny and a little bit out of whack.’ ‘These things he takes off the top of his head, he just makes up in real time and everyone around him tries to justify it,’ the Harris surrogate said. ‘And that’s the even crazier part.’ Want more stories like this from the Daily Mail?

These will be ideal spots for relocating entire industries that we’ve taken in from other countries,” he said. In addition, he announced more help for Savannah, Georgia, an important seaside port city. Noting that his administration helped deepen Savannah’s port, Trump pledged a similar project if he were to win the presidency. He said he intends to enlist the Army Corps of Engineers to work with state transportation officials for this “major undertaking.” Coupled with other policies, Savannah would see a big payoff, Trump pledged. According to Trump, however, such a tax hike would cause businesses to leave America in “droves.” Policies that hurt energy production would also cause companies to “flee,” he said. Trump said he believes that current environmental regulations are choking American businesses, preventing the nation from taking advantage of its natural resources and increasing American reliance on foreign materials and products. Instead, Trump said he would push policies that would help the nation “use our resources to our benefit, and it will be clean and environmentally perfect.” “We’re sitting on trillions and trillions of dollars under our feet,” Trump said, referring to natural resources such as gas, oil, and rare-earth minerals. Trump repeated his past pledges to add tariffs to Mexican-manufactured vehicles, stop selling U.S. steel to Japan, and take steps that would cut energy costs in half, aiding businesses as well as families. “To the auto workers in Michigan, Georgia, and all other parts of our country, I am pinpointing you for greatness. Your industry has been decimated,” he said, citing company decisions as well as government policies.","summary":"The former president added more specifics to his plans for boosting industries, along with the overall economy, during a campaign speech in Georgia.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/trump-proposes-manufacturing-ambassador-to-travel-globe-urge-companies-to-return-to-us-5729326","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/09/id5729426-1.tagreuters.com2024binary_LYNXMPEK8N0R4-FILEDIMAGE-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 21:55:03","author":"Janice Hisle","authors":["Janice Hisle"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.028},{"id":257290100,"title":"Haitian Group Seeks Criminal Charges in Legal Filing Against Trump, Vance","text":"The head of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, a nonprofit organization that advocates for Haitian migrants, wants to criminally prosecute former President Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) regarding claims they have made about illegal immigrants eating pets in Springfield. The Cleveland-based Chandra Law Firm, which represents the plaintiff, said in a Sept. 24 statement that the nonprofit used a state statute that permits private citizens to “file an affidavit charging the offense committed.” The statement reported that alliance co-founder and executive director Guerline Jozef accused Vance and Trump of six crimes, including disrupting public service by causing widespread bomb and other threats, making false claims and knowingly causing alarm by repeating lies that officials have said were false, and knowingly causing others to falsely believe that members of Springfield’s Haitian community would cause serious physical harm to the person or property of others. The legal filing requests that the court find probable cause for the charges and issue arrest warrants for Trump and Vance. After learning about the request for charges, Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told The Epoch Times, “President Trump is rightfully highlighting the failed immigration system that Kamala Harris has overseen, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants pouring into communities like Springfield and many others across the country. “President Trump will secure our border and put an end to the chaos that illegal immigration brings to our communities,” Cheung said in a statement on Sept. 24. The Epoch Times contacted Vance’s team for comment but has yet to get a response. According to Ohio law, a private citizen seeking to “cause an arrest or prosecution” can file an affidavit with a judge, prosecuting attorney, or magistrate and ask them to review the facts and determine if a complaint should be filed. As part of the legal process, the court must convene a hearing before making a decision about the affidavit. A spokesperson for the Clark County Clerk of Courts directed The Epoch Times to the Springfield city prosecutor and the Clark County prosecutor. Requests for comment were not returned by publication time. Springfield was once a booming industrial community before multiple factories closed in recent decades, and its population began to decline, falling to just below 60,000 by 2020. In the past four years, however, the population has risen with an influx of Haitian immigrants. Anywhere from 15,000 to 30,000 Haitians have arrived in Springfield during this period, according to estimates. The Haitian immigrant issue in Springfield was mostly confined to the city and Clark County until the Sept. 10 presidential debate when Trump called attention to the allegations. “In Springfield, they’re eating the dogs. The people that came in, they’re eating the cats. They’re eating the pets of the people that live there,” Trump said. At an Aug. 27 city council meeting, some residents alleged that Haitians were killing cats, dogs, ducks, and geese for food. Other citizens said they have informed city officials about missing pets over several months. Before the debate, Vance said his office had been inundated with those claims. On X, Vance wrote that “reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn’t be in this country.” Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, who has expressed support for the Haitian migrants and has criticized Trump and Vance for their comments, recently said that the bomb threats originated from overseas.

The 26-25 party-line vote was just the latest friction point between the GOP and the State Department this Congress. Republicans have worked for the last 18 months to hold the Biden administration accountable for what they have called a “stunning failure of leadership” after Taliban forces seized the Afghan capital in August 2021. “Rather than take accountability for this, the secretary hides from the American people. He would prefer to hide rather than be before this committee today,” said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the chairman of the committee. “The Secretary’s willful indifference has brought us to this moment.” The resolution now moves to the full House, which could vote to hold Blinken in contempt of Congress and refer the matter to the Justice Department. Blinken, in a letter to McCaul, said that he was “profoundly disappointed” in the chairman's decision to advance contempt proceedings and urged him to find a resolution in “good faith.” \"As I have made clear, I am willing to testify and have offered several reasonable alternatives to the dates unilaterally demanded by the Committee during which I am carrying out the President’s important foreign policy objectives,” Blinken wrote in a Sunday letter. McCaul defended his decision Tuesday, saying that he had “patiently asked for and waited” on Blinken's availability and that the department has been “disingenuous” because it had declined repeated requests to pick a date in September for Blinken to testify. McCaul had first set a hearing for Blinken to testify last Thursday, while the secretary was in Egypt and France. He then changed the date to Tuesday, when Blinken was at the annual U.N. General Assembly gathering of world leaders in New York and attending President Joe Biden ’s speech at the time of the hearing. As all secretaries of state have in the past, Blinken will spend the entire week in New York holding dozens of meetings with his counterparts on a variety of issues but this year with a focus on the Mideast situation and the Ukraine-Russia conflict. Democrats on the committee blasted Republicans' contempt efforts as purely partisan, noting it’s taking place less than two months before a presidential election. “It’s not difficult for the American people to see this for what it is: political theater,” New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, the top Democrat on the committee, said in an opening statement. “Another attempt to put another senior Biden administration official name into negative headlines.” Former President Donald Trump has repeatedly brought up the disastrous exit from Afghanistan in the campaign, trying to link it to his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. Several watchdog reviews and a more than 18-month investigation by House Republicans have failed to pinpoint an instance where Harris had a particular impact on decision-making on the withdrawal. Blinken has testified about Afghanistan 14 times, including four times before McCaul’s committee. Miller said Blinken was willing to testify again if a mutually convenient time could be arranged but noted that Congress will be in recess from the end of this week until after the November election. Earlier this month, House Republicans issued a scathing report on their investigation into the withdrawal, blaming the disastrous end of America’s longest war on the Biden administration while minimizing Trump’s role. The partisan review laid out the final months of military and civilian failures, following Trump’s February 2020 withdrawal deal, which allowed the Taliban to conquer the country even before the last U.S. officials flew out on Aug. 30, 2021. The chaotic exit left behind many American citizens, Afghan battlefield allies, female activists and others at risk from the Taliban. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

General Assembly on Tuesday that the U.S. must not retreat from the world, as Israel and Hezbollah militants in Lebanon edged toward all-out war and Israel’s bloody operation against Hamas in Gaza neared the one-year mark. Biden used his wide-ranging address to speak to a need to end the Middle East conflict and the 17-month-old civil war in Sudan and to highlight U.S. and Western allies' support for Kyiv since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022. He also raised concern over artificial intelligence and its potential to be used for repression. His appearance before the international body offered Biden one of his last high-profile opportunities as president to make the case to keep up robust support for Ukraine, which could be in doubt if former President Donald Trump defeats Vice President Kamala Harris in November. Biden insisted that despite global conflicts, he remains hopeful for the future. “I’ve seen a remarkable sweep of history,\" Biden said. “I know many look at the world today and see difficulties and react with despair but I do not.” “We are stronger than we think” when the world acts together, he added. Biden came to office promising to rejuvenate U.S. relations around the world and to extract the U.S. from “forever wars” in Afghanistan and Iraq that consumed American foreign policy over the last 20 years. “I was determined to end it, and I did,” Biden said of the Afghanistan exit, calling it a “hard decision but the right decision.” He acknowledged that it was \"accompanied by tragedy” with the deaths of 13 American troops and hundreds of Afghans in a suicide bombing during the chaotic withdrawal. But his foreign policy legacy may ultimately be shaped by his administration's response to two of the biggest conflicts in Europe and the Middle East since World War II. “There will always be forces that pull our countries apart,” Biden said, rejecting “a desire to retreat from the world and go it alone.” He said, \"Our task, our test, is to make sure that the forces holding us together are stronger than the forces pulling us apart.” The Pentagon announced Monday that it was sending a small number of additional U.S. troops to the Middle East to supplement the roughly 40,000 already in the region. All the while, the White House insists Israel and Hezbollah still have time to step back and de-escalate. “Full scale war is not in anyone’s interest,” Biden said, and despite escalating violence, a diplomatic solution is the only path to peace. Biden had a hopeful outlook for the Middle East when he addressed the U.N. just a year ago. In that speech, Biden spoke of a “sustainable, integrated Middle East” coming into view. At the time, economic relations between Israel and some of its Arab neighbors were improving with implementation of the Abraham Accords that Israel signed with Bahrain, Morocco and the United Arab Emirates during the Trump administration. Biden's team helped resolve a long-running Israel-Lebanon maritime dispute that had held back gas exploration in the region. And Israel-Saudi normalization talks were progressing, a game-changing alignment for the region if a deal could be landed. “I suffer from an oxymoron: Irish optimism,” Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu when they met on the sidelines of last year's U.N. gathering. He added, \"If you and I, 10 years ago, were talking about normalization with Saudi Arabia ... I think we’d look at each other like, ‘Who’s been drinking what?’” Eighteen days later, Biden's Middle East hopes came crashing down. Hamas militants stormed into Israel killing 1,200, taking some 250 hostage, and spurring a bloody war that has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and led the region into a complicated downward spiral. Now, the conflict is threatening to metastasize into a multi-front war and leave a lasting scar on Biden's presidential legacy. Israel and Hezbollah traded strikes again Tuesday as the death toll from a massive Israeli bombardment climbed to nearly 560 people and thousands fled from southern Lebanon. It's the deadliest barrage since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. Israel has urged residents of southern Lebanon to evacuate from homes and other buildings where it claimed Hezbollah has stored weapons, saying the military would conduct “extensive strikes” against the militant group. Hezbollah, meanwhile, has launched dozens of rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes last week that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters. Dozens were also killed last week and hundreds more wounded after hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah militants exploded, a sophisticated attack that was widely believed to have been carried out by Israel. Israel's leadership launched its counterattacks at a time of growing impatience with the Iranian-backed Hezbollah's persistent launching of missiles and drones across the Israel-Lebanon border after Hamas started the war with its brazen attack on Oct. 7. Biden reiterated his call on the parties to agree to a cease-fire and hostage release deal, saying it's time to \"end this war\" — even as hopes for such a deal are fading as the conflict drags on. Biden, in his address, called for the sustainment of Western support for Ukraine in its war with Russia. Biden helped galvanize an international coalition to back Ukraine with weapons and economic aid in response to Russian President Vladimir Putin's February 2022 assault on Ukraine. “We cannot grow weary,\" Biden said. \"We cannot look away.” Biden has managed to keep up American support in the face of rising skepticism from some Republican lawmakers — and Trump — about the cost of the conflict. At the same time, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is pressing Biden to loosen restrictions on the use of Western-supplied long-range missiles so that Ukrainian forces can hit deeper in Russia. So far Zelenskyy has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Putin has warned that Russia would be “at war” with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. Biden and Harris are scheduled to hold separate meetings with Zelenskyy in Washington on Thursday. Ukrainian officials were also trying to arrange a meeting for Zelenskyy with Trump this week, though a Trump campaign official said it wasn't going to materialize. The president also sounded an alarm about the rapid advances in artificial intelligence development, particularly around disinformation, respect for human life and the potential exploitation by totalitarian powers. He told the world leaders, \"There may well be no greater test of our leadership than how we deal with A.I.\" “We must make certain that the awesome capabilities of A.I. will be used to uplift and empower everyday people, not to give dictators more powerful shackles on the human spirit,\" he added. Later, he held a bilateral meeting with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and joined other world leaders in an event highlighting their partnership to combat the production and distribution of synthetic opioids like fentanyl, which drive tens of thousands of deaths in the U.S. annually alone. Biden struck a wistful tone in his remarks, peppering his speech with references to his first time attending the General Assembly more than 50 years ago, and quoting Irish poetry. Biden held up his decision to step aside up as an instructive moment as he addressed a gathering that has no small share of totalitarian and nondemocratic leaders. “Some things are more important than staying in power,\" Biden said. \"It’s your people that matter the most. Never forget, we are here to serve the people. Not the other way around.” © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

I never thought I had a problem. But the fake news keeps saying women don’t like me. I don’t believe it. You know why? They like to have strong borders. They like to have safety.” Shortly after, he told the women present, “You’re not going to be in danger any longer. You will no longer have anxiety from all of the problems our country has today. You will be protected and I will be your protector. Women will be happy, healthy, confident, and free. You will no longer be thinking about abortion.” There is so much to unpack here, starting with the idea that women will be “free” if the guy who took away the federal right to an abortion returns to power. Then there’s the claim that women will be “protected” by a guy who was found liable last year for sexually abusing and defaming a woman, and has a long history of disparaging women. (Remember when his response to Taylor Swift endorsing Kamala Harris was to declare “I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!” to his legions of followers? You should because it happened less than two weeks ago.) But mostly, there’s the bizarre assertion that women will “no longer be thinking about abortion” when he’s president, because what the actual fuck does that mean? It presumably has to do with Trump’s attempt to tie immigration to rape—as he has done for years—and to somehow suggest that under his draconian immigration policies, rape and pregnancies resulting from rape will no longer happen. Which, once again, shows just how little he knows about women and why the right to abortion is important. As people who are not Trump know, there are many, many reasons a person might “be thinking about abortion”—reasons that have nothing to do with rape* by the people he claims are destroying this country. Is Trump going to stop ectopic pregnancies from happening? Is he going to find cure for fatal fetal abnormalities? Is he going to ensure childcare is affordable so that a person who already has children can afford to have more?** Is he going to eliminate rape not just by the immigrants he demonizes but by people born in this country? Is he going to single-handedly stop all sperm from fertilizing eggs that don’t want to be fertilized? In a statement published by The New York Times, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign said, of Trump’s claims, “women know better. He tries to tell us what to think and what we care about. We will vote like our lives depend on it this November.” *Though that obviously happens too, and thanks to Republicans like Trump, many people who become pregnant as a result of rape no longer have the option to get an abortion. **Seem very unlikely!

The Haitian Bridge Alliance made the move after inaction by the local prosecutor, said their attorney, Subodh Chandra of the Cleveland-based Chandra Law Firm. Charges brought by private citizens are rare, but not unheard of, in Ohio. Examples might be a grocery store charging a customer for a bounced check. State law requires a hearing to take place before the affidavit can move forward. As of Tuesday afternoon, none had been scheduled. Trump and Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio, are charged with disrupting public services, making false alarms, telecommunications harassment, aggravated menacing and complicity. The filing asks the Clark County Municipal Court to affirm that there is probable cause and issue arrest warrants against Trump and Vance. “Their persistence and relentlessness, even in the face of the governor and the mayor saying this is false, that shows intent,” Chandra said. “It's knowing, willful flouting of criminal law.” Steven Cheung, communications director for the Trump-Vance campaign, said, “President Trump is rightfully highlighting the failed immigration system that (Vice President) Kamala Harris has overseen, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants pouring into communities like Springfield and many others across the country.” The 15,000 to 20,000 Haitian immigrants who have arrived in Springfield over the past several years, in many cases after being recruited to local jobs, have been granted Temporary Protected Status to be in the U.S. legally. More than 30 bomb threats were directed at state and local government buildings and schools, prompting closures, the assignment of additional law enforcement protection and security cameras. Some of the city's Haitian residents have also said they feared for their safety as public vitriol grew, and Mayor Rob Rue has received death threats. “If it were anyone else other than Trump and Vance who had done what they’ve done — wreak havoc on Springfield, resulting in bomb threats, evacuated and closed government buildings and schools, threats to the mayor and his family — they would have been arrested by now,” Chandra said. “They are not above the law.” Chandra said the U.S. Supreme Court's July ruling granting ex-presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution does not apply in this case because Trump is currently a private citizen and Vance did not amplify the rumors that members of Springfield's 15,000-member Haitian community were eating people's pets in his capacity as a senator. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

With the presidential election just six weeks away, the Republican candidate and his Democratic rival Kamala Harris are in a dead-heat race that influential pollsters have said is as close as any they have seen in years. They have been honing their economic messages as they target the few remaining undecided voters across a handful of battleground states, with Trump leaning heavily on a protectionist message as the key to unlocking US manufacturing potential. In a speech in the hotly-contested state of Georgia, Trump repeated his plan to levy across-the-board tariffs on all foreign imports. \"If you don't make your product here, then you will have to pay a tariff, a very substantial tariff, when you send your product into the United States,\" he told the Johnny Mercer Theatre in Savannah. He has previously described potential levies of 10 or 20 percent on all imports, and 60 percent or higher for Asian economic powerhouse China. It is Americans who pay the tariffs on U.S. imports -- not the foreign exporter -- and economists estimate that the various versions of Trump's plan would cost U.S. households between $2,000 and $6,000 extra a year. But Trump vowed to \"take in\" hundreds of billions of dollars to benefit American citizens, and rejected the expert consensus that long-term tariffs cause inflation. He warned of his intention to levy a 100 percent tariff on cars imported from Mexico and said he would reduce corporate tax rate from 21 percent to 15 for companies manufacturing domestically. \"With the vision I'm outlining today, not only will we stop our businesses from leaving for foreign lands but, under my leadership, we are going to take other countries' jobs,\" Trump said, adding that \"we're going to take their factories.\" Trump, 78, also said he wanted German automakers to \"become American car companies.\" \"I want them to build their plants here,\" he said. \"I want to beat China in electronics production.\" Trump raised eyebrows Monday when he threatened U.S. agricultural company John Deere with 200 percent tariffs if they move manufacturing to Mexico. Business tycoon Mark Cuban, a star of the ABC reality television series \"Shark Tank,\" said Trump's across-the-board tariff plan was an example of his penchant for crafting policies \"off the top of his head that tend to often be ridiculous, if not insane.\" \"We all know that that's inflationary, but he seems to think that that's a tax on a foreign nation,\" Cuban said of the proposals during a Harris campaign press call. \"So what Donald Trump has suggested to John Deere in the 200 percent tariff is ridiculously bad and destructive,\" he added. Trump also hit on previously released policies to reduce regulation and slash energy costs in half, and talked about selling off federal land and boosting port infrastructure as part of a blueprint he called the \"New American Industrialism.\" He slammed Harris, 59, over her plan to repeal the tax cuts he signed into law at the end of 2017, which are due to expire at the end of next year, and accused her of raising energy prices and presiding over runaway inflation and spending. Harris, who was in Savannah last month, was off the trail on Tuesday in Washington. Ahead of Trump's speech, the Teamsters unions in Georgia, Florida and Alabama endorsed the vice president, meaning she now has the backing of branches representing more than 1.5 million active and retired members across the battleground states -- although not the national organization. She was also endorsed in an open letter by more than 400 economic and business experts, including Nobel Prize winners, a former Federal Reserve vice chairman and numerous university academics. © 2024 AFP","summary":"Donald Trump pledged Tuesday to deliver a historic windfall for the United States through a business-friendly economy that would reward companies manufacturing domestically -- but heavily penalize those…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/world/defying-experts-trump-vows-tariff-driven-us-economic-boom","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/19/4b/8eb4258c980a638b6cd798babd57518e8b0f/194b8eb4258c980a638b6cd798babd57518e8b0f/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 21:46:47","author":"Chandan Khanna,Japan Today Editor","authors":["Chandan Khanna","Japan Today Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"business","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.037}]}
