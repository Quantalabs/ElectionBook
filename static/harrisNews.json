Who among us will quickly forget the legendary iconic former President of South Africa? For a lot of diverse reasons, and for a lot of people, Mandela is unforgettable. He was imprisoned for 27 years. Harsh conditions and degrading treatment he endured for long. For the apartheid regime and some mean and powerful individuals, the goal was to belittle him and diminish his efforts. But Mandela’s spirit and sense of purpose remain unshaken. He refused to be broken by the system that was designed to make him feel worthless. Instead, he used his time to strengthen his resolve and maintain his dignity. His ability to rise above personal insults and challenges and his focus on the greater good eventually led to the dismantling of apartheid and his election as South Africa’s first Black president. Mandela stood his ground in the face of persistent emotional and physical pummelling by his adversaries. His story is a powerful testament to how you too can maintain self-worth and integrity despite attempts to belittle or oppress. Has your path ever crossed some people in life who try to make you look small, worthless, and irrelevant? Have you been shouted down and shut up by friends and family members who strove to make you feel small and inconsequential about yourself through their words or actions toward you? People will do to you only what you let them. Anytime you experience disparaging behaviours from people, let it be known that you probably have some virtues and values that your harassers covet but do not possess. The more they come at you, the more you should refuse to be cowed down. Thus, this week, I offer this encouragement to someone through this treatise: Let nobody shut you down, shut you up, or make you feel small as you travel in the journey of life. I heard these uplifting words from America’s current Vice President Kamala Harris when she was striving to become the country’s first female and first Black Vice President of the world’s biggest economy. “I have been told many times during my career things from “oh, you are too young, it’s not your turn…they are not ready for you. I’ve heard that many times over the course of my career. But I didn’t listen. I will encourage anyone who’s been told that to not listen. Don’t be encumbered by the inability of others to see the potential of who you are.” My friends, let nobody shut you down, shut you up, or make you feel small as you travel in the journey of life. If people who try to make you look worthless don’t know your worth, they have no eyes to see great value. Remember that a blind person cannot design a map. If some people don’t appreciate your worth, it doesn’t mean you are worthless. Be angry not with people who know not your value. That they do not know your value does not make you valueless. Where your worth is not appreciated; walk away with your precious worth. There are hordes of beings out there warming up to celebrate you, not desecrate you. You have worth. You are too wonderfully packaged to be carelessly unwrapped. You are too beautifully made to be treated ugly. You are too expensively put together to be dealt with cheaply. No surveillance technique or technology can detect human prowess and talents. Science and technology have not yet developed how cameras can capture the indwelling human abilities, skills, and potential of created beings. For science and scientists, this appears to be a quixotic quest. Any scientific submission claiming such is a grandstanding guesswork. Technology can only capture the face and inner anatomical images of the organs in the body of a talented man. That is all today’s technology can do. But how then do people know what God has naturally endowed you to do? You tell them and you do what you claim you can do. Telling people about your strength, you are not flatly arrogant or falsely arrogating, you are wise. There are people who need your skill, and they may not know you’ve got it. Instead of letting men shut you down, stand on a higher ground announcing your worth. Trumpet your worth and let the world hear you. Announce yourself! Publicise yourself! Showcase your resume! Present your case and show forth your argument! There are about 9,000 species of birds the world over. And unfortunately, many of them are in a cage. One of the worst experiences of life is when a man or woman created and destined big and bountiful, and fat and flourishing remains small. People in this category are like a bird in a cage. Break that cage. Someone out there needs your skill. A government out there needs your skill. A president out there needs your skill. A governor out there needs your talent. A business magnate out there needs your ability. A nation out there needs your skill set. By not promoting yourself, you are demoting yourself. It is not humility to keep quiet about your natural skills, it is foolishness. Get up and announce yourself and heaven will join in announcing you! Blow your trumpets, stop being a puppet! You may only have to do what you can do once for the world to see, and forever you are known. Thereafter, people who never knew of you will seek you. Anywhere you go, and anywhere you find yourself this week and beyond, believe that you are the light assigned to bring out hidden lights. People will try to hide your light; they will try to hide and make you subservient to them. If you truly know who you are, you will not let them accomplish their belittling purpose. Your gifts, abilities, and potential you bring to the negotiating table of life are that light. Let it shine. Sit it on the nightstand. Let it glow radiantly. Let it pierce through the darkness of today into the obscurity of tomorrow. Only you can do that for you. The world must hear about you. You are not a secret to be kept. You are not a plague to be avoided. You are not an infection to be kept in isolation. You are a city on the hill that must be seen. Anywhere you go, and anywhere you find yourself, believe that you are a city strategically positioned on the top of the hill that cannot be hidden. Stand tall without being arrogant. Stand shoulder-high without being haughty. Stand out without being condescending. If you do all of these, you have done it unto the One who made you in His image and after His likeness for a purpose.

Shapiro as VP: poll","text":"A recent survey of 600 likely voters shows former President Donald Trump holds a 2-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania. The results, from North Star Polling Research, come amid swirling rumors that Gov. Josh Shapiro may join Harris on the ticket as her running mate – a choice that could boost her popularity in the commonwealth but cost her in Michigan and Wisconsin. Shapiro, who is Jewish, has denounced Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israeli civilians and pushed university leaders to disband pro-Palestinian protest encampments at colleges across the state. This, analysts say, makes him unappealing to younger voters opposed to Israel’s military campaign in Gaza. “For Harris, she has to run the table on those Rust Belt swing states,” said John McHenry, who conducted the survey. “She can’t lose any of them and win the presidency.” He added that running mate picks don’t generally make or break a presidential ticket. “It’s pretty rare that the individual matters,” he said. “I think it tells more about the presidential nominee’s decision making process.” Trump’s running mate choice JD Vance, McHenry said, likely “matters less than almost any other in recent history.” “It says, ‘I’m ahead and I don’t need to reach so far towards the middle. I’m going to reinforce my base and this is a base pick,’” he said of Trump’s decision. “He’s certainly not going to lose the presidency over JD Vance,” McHenry added. “By the same token, I don’t think Harris is going to win or lose based on who she picks.” Harris already fares better with Pennsylvania voters, with or without Shapiro. McHenry’s polling shows she narrowed Trump’s 9-point lead over President Joe Biden held before he dropped out. Most of that gain came from registered Democrats, though she “has a long way to go” on bringing independents into the fold. Down ballot, however, Trump’s popularity hasn’t swayed support for Republican Senate nominee Dave McCormick, who trails incumbent Democratic Sen. Bob Casey 49%-41%. McHenry said McCormick hasn’t yet appealed to certain parts of Trump’s electorate, including “soft” Republicans and working-class voters. An attack ad his campaign published this week, however, “is exactly the right messaging to make that happen.” In the advertisement, McCormick highlights Harris’ progressive record on criminal justice reform and immigration enforcement. Elsewhere in the survey, more than half of respondents said Biden’s economic policies leave the middle class worse off, while 51% said their financial situation was better during Trump’s presidency. Biden’s debate performance also turned off supporters, with 31% of respondents saying they were more likely to vote for Trump in the aftermath. Trump’s attempted assassination boosted his support slightly, with 21% saying they were “more likely” to vote for him. The survey was conducted from July 20 through July 23 with a 4% margin of error.","summary":"A recent survey of 600 likely voters shows former President Donald Trump holds a 2-point lead over Vice President Kamala Harris in Pennsylvania.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/trump-maintains-lead-in-pennsylvania-as-harris-eyes-gov-shapiro-as-vp-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-i63lyok0v-1721948895201.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721934676&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/wPb0Y7rU-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:50:58","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.048},{"id":252644250,"title":"Harris Says There Is ‘Hopeful Movement’ Toward Israel-Hamas Cease-Fire Deal After Netanyahu Meeting","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Vice President Kamala Harris shared details from her conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday, telling reporters there has been “hopeful movement” in the negotiations to secure a cease-fire and hostage deal that would mark the end of war between Israel and Hamas, which has dragged on for more than nine months.

(Photo by Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images) Getty Images Key Facts Harris said the cease-fire deal would be split into two phases—the first of which would involve a full cease-fire and the withdrawal of Israeli military forces from population centers in Gaza, while the second phase would entail Israel’s military withdrawing from Gaza entirely. The vice president also said Israel has a right to defend itself but noted “how it does so matters.” Harris expressed concern for Israeli American hostages who remain captive in Gaza and said she raised her concern with Netanyahu about the deaths of innocent civilians in Gaza and the more than 2.5 million people within the region who are experiencing food insecurity. “I will not be silent,” Harris said, referring to the “tragedies” and “suffering” in Gaza, where more than 39,000 people have been killed since the start of the war, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The vice president said she remains “committed to a path forward that can lead to a two-state solution,” which is a proposed solution for ending the Israeli-Palestinian conflict via the establishment of two states for Jewish people and Palestinians, respectively.

Crucial Quote “A two-state solution is the only path that ensures Israel remains a secure, Jewish and democratic state and one that ensures Palestinians can finally realize the freedom, security and prosperity that they rightly deserve,” Harris said. Key Background The conflict between Israel and Hamas began more than nine months ago, when Hamas invaded multiple areas of southern Israel, killing more than 1,200 people and taking more than 240 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Sixty-three hostages died on the invasion day or during the months since, with 111 hostages believed to be still alive in Gaza, according to Israeli officials. Israel retaliated not long after with an invasion of Gaza and has continued military operations in the region, where more than 39,000 have been killed and where the United Nations has issued a famine alert.

Ambassador Nikki Haley credited Democrats for launching Vice President Kamala Harris as a younger alternative to President Joe Biden, she warned that age isn’t the only factor at play this election cycle. During an interview with CNN, Haley admitted that the Left made a savvy move in pushing 81-year-old Biden to drop his reelection bid. “Democrats were very smart to put in a younger candidate,” the former South Carolina governor told host Jake Tapper. Haley also believed Biden’s heir apparent still faces a long shot at winning the presidency. “If you look at it, they put in the weakest candidate,” Haley told the network. Harris’s Republican opponents have long criticized the vice president for her prosecutorial record as California attorney general and for the increase in illegal immigrants coming in at the southern border. Haley said Republicans should focus on those issues instead of campaigning against Harris as an alleged diversity, equity, and inclusion hire. “Not helpful,” Haley remarked about DEI talking points. ”Talk about the facts.” Haley urged the GOP to focus on Harris’s policies. “We’re talking about a liberal senator who literally has not accomplished very much. You don’t need to talk about what she looks like or what gender she is.” Her comments come as top Republicans, including House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA), have also warned conservatives to steer away from DEI attacks against Harris. While Haley has said she would vote for Trump despite their bitter rivalry on the campaign trail, even endorsing him at the Republican National Convention, she refused to back down from the “tough things” she has said about him in the past. “I don’t think we need to apologize or take anything back,” she told Tapper on Thursday. “I said a lot of tough things about him in the campaign. He said a lot of tough things about me in the campaign. That’s what happens in campaigns,” Haley said, downplaying the two’s public sparring earlier this year. While she told CNN she continues to disagree with Trump on some issues, she believes he’s a better alternative to Harris. “We’ve been given a choice, Trump or Harris,” Haley said before adding that she doesn’t think voters have to “agree with Trump 100% of the time to vote for him.”","summary":"While former U.N.

This brave decision underscores a commendable act of putting the country’s interests above personal political ambitions and offers a crucial lesson to African leadership. In a July 21 letter to the American public, Biden said: “It has been the greatest honour of my life to serve as your president. And while it has been my intention to seek re-election, I believe it is in the best interest of the party and of the country for me to stand down and to focus solely on fulfilling my duties as President for the remainder of my term.” Biden was responding to calls by party leaders and concerned Democrats, who urged him to quit the race due to the existing political odds. The financial support from donors for the 81-year-old showed a lack of confidence in his candidacy. Biden took off with $95.9 million in campaign funds, but Kamala Harris was able to secure enough Democratic National Committee delegates and raise $126 million in three days. His voluntary exit highlights the importance of selflessness and strategic foresight in governance. By endorsing Harris, Biden has entrusted the country to the next generation of leaders. He has also shown a willingness to prioritise continuity and unity within the party and the US. African leaders can draw valuable lessons from Biden. Too often, Africa’s political arena is dominated by leaders who cling to power at the expense of their countries’ progress and stability. This usually overshadows the broader needs of their countries, leading to political turmoil, economic instability, and social unrest. Several African leaders have perpetuated themselves through constitutional changes, electoral manipulation, and other means. Presidents Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Paul Biya of Cameroon, Paul Kagame of Rwanda, and Mahamat Deby of Chad remain in power employing these means. Unfortunately, Africa has a long history of such leaders. Among them were Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, Jose dos Santos of Angola, Omar al-Bashir of Sudan, Teodoro Nguema of Equatorial Guinea, and Idris Deby of Chad. Gnassingbé Eyadéma held power in Togo from 1967 until he died in 2005, and was succeeded by Faure, his son. In Nigeria, former President Umaru Yar’Adua held on to power despite his ailment. The country was almost plunged into political instability when he died in May 2010. Former President Muhammadu Buhari frequented United Kingdom hospitals while at the helm despite the security and multidimensional poverty in the country. These messianic and despotic dispositions of African leaders besmirch democracy and stagnate development. African leaders who are incapacitated should throw in the towel. Biden has set a powerful precedent. It is a reminder that leadership is not merely about holding office but about the ability to serve the people. The true measure of a leader lies in their ability to step aside when necessary, allowing for the emergence of new ideas and fresh perspectives that can drive national development. Biden has shown that stepping down can be an act of strength rather than weakness. Furthermore, Biden’s decision reflects a deep understanding of the changing political landscape and the need for adaptability. He understood that the political happenstances after the public debate signalled unfavourable outcomes. So, African leaders should identify the demographic shifts and socioeconomic changes in their domains, prepare for succession, and nurture future leaders. They should make sure that their countries are free of personal agendas. African leaders should recognise that the sustainability and prosperity of a country depend on leaders willing to place the country’s interests above their own, fostering a culture of succession and continuity that ensures lasting progress and stability.","summary":"THE withdrawal of United States President, Joe Biden, from the presidential race and his endorsement of Vice-President Kamala Harris as the presumptive Democratic Party candidate marks a significant moment in American political history.

The 81-year-old had finally come round to the same conclusion that many voters, and party insiders, reached in the aftermath of last month's disastrous debate performance. After roughly half a century in federal politics, and one term as president, it was time to step aside in favour of a new Democratic candidate to contest this year's election. \"I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life,\" Biden said in a televised address to the nation. \"But there is also a time and place for new voices, fresh voices — yes, younger voices. And that time and place is now.\" Biden talked up his record in the White House and made clear that he still believes he deserves a second term. Aside from referring to a need to \"unite\" his party, he didn't provide any detail on what had eventually changed his mind after weeks of defiance. But in echoing language used against his candidacy in the days leading up to his announcement, declaring it was now time to \"pass the torch\", Biden pointed to his previous but later abandoned pledge of being a \"bridge\" candidate to a new generation. And in an election in which he argues democracy itself is on the line, the president sought to frame his decision as being bigger than \"personal ambition\". Biden will join a relatively small group of US presidents who opted out of running for a second term. History will judge how the manner and timing of his exit affects his party's chances in November. For all the excitement now building within Democratic circles about Vice-President Kamala Harris, some would argue Biden should have bowed out sooner. But with six months still to go until his successor takes over, the president is now focused on trying to cement his legacy with the time he has left in the White House. An outgoing president with plenty to do Republicans have called on Biden to quit altogether, arguing that if the president isn't up to serving for another four years, he shouldn't be the commander-in-chief now. But Biden again insisted in his address that he'd serve out the remainder of his term, and singled out several priorities for the months ahead. The president has foreshadowed controversial changes to the Supreme Court, reportedly involving term limits and an enforceable ethics code, at a time when conservative justices are in the majority. He promised a continued focus on strengthening the NATO alliance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and vowed \"to keep doing the same for our allies in the Pacific\". And he said he'd \"keep working\" to end the war in Gaza, nine months into a conflict that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. Biden followed up by meeting Israel's prime minister, a day after Benjamin Netanyahu told Congress he would settle for nothing less than \"total victory\" against Hamas. The US remains Israel's most important ally and has sent the country billions of dollars of military assistance, even as Biden has at times criticised Netanyahu's approach to the war. Speaking as the two leaders met, White House spokesman John Kirby said the president would be pressing Netanyahu for progress towards an agreement for a ceasefire and the release of the remaining hostages. \"We are closer now, we believe, than we've been before,\" Kirby said. \"We believe that they are of a nature where they can be closed, and that we can achieve a deal, but it's going to require as it always does, some leadership, some compromise and an effort to get there.\" Netanyahu also sat down with Harris, who'd skipped his congressional address, citing a scheduling clash. In remarks delivered after the meeting, which she described as \"frank and constructive\", she said Israel had a right to defend itself, but \"how it does so matters\", adding that she had \"serious concern about the scale of human suffering\". \"We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies,\" she said. Asked whether Harris would approach the conflict differently to Biden, Kirby earlier insisted the vice-president had been a \"full partner\" in the administration's Middle East policies. But she appears to have at least signalled a shift in how she'll discuss the conflict, and seemed to try to appeal to voters who've abandoned the president over his handling of the war. \"To everyone who has been calling for a ceasefire, and to everyone who yearns for peace, I see you and I hear you,\" she said. \"Let's get the deal done.\" Netanyahu is also looking ahead to the possibility of a second Trump administration, with plans to meet the former president at his Mar-a-lago property in Florida on his way home. \"I want him to finish up and get it done quickly,\" Trump told Fox News of his message to Netanyahu ahead of his visit. \"You know Israel is not very good at public relations, I'll tell you that.\" Harris vs Trump Things have moved quickly on the Democratic side of politics in the days since Biden's withdrawal reshaped the race. The vice-president speedily secured the support needed to solidify her position as the expected nominee, and has started sharpening her attack against Trump. One of Harris's central campaign messages is that of the \"prosecutor vs the felon\", contrasting her public record against the former president's criminal convictions. She's also leaning into her relative youth, and a wave of timely gen Z memes, and will likely ramp up her focus on reproductive rights — an issue she'd already taken the lead on as part of the Biden-Harris ticket. Trump, meanwhile, has well and truly shifted his focus onto his new opponent. At a rally in North Carolina, held just before Biden's national address, the former president repeatedly pronounced her name incorrectly (for the record, it's KAHM-uh-luh), and branded Harris a \"radical left lunatic\". And in that same Fox interview on Thursday, he hit back at the vice-president's criticisms as \"disgusting\". \"They say, 'Sir, be nice, you just got hit with a bullet, maybe he's changed, be nice,'\" he said. \"And I'd love to be nice but I'm dealing against real garbage.\" Trump's campaign is making several key arguments against Harris — that her background in the liberal city of San Francisco shows she's too far to the left, that she botched an immigration role assigned to her in the early days of the Biden administration, and that she helped to cover up concerns about Biden's age. It will take some time before opinion polls paint a picture of where voters might be sitting following the Biden/Harris switch, but early surveys suggest Americans are still in for a close race. And in the meantime, it appears calls to dial down the political rhetoric since Trump's attempted assassination have all but evaporated. 'Cat ladies' controversy as the Veep race is redrawn Elevating Harris to the top spot means the vice-president now needs to choose her own running mate. Some analysts are sceptical of the idea that a vice-presidential pick can influence the outcome in particular states, instead arguing they help to shape perceptions of the candidate running for the White House. Either way, a long list of names has been floated and Harris's campaign will be weighing up how they'd fare against Trump's newly announced number two, JD Vance. Loading... At 39 years old, the Ohio senator is much younger than Trump and has emphasised his \"Rust Belt\" upbringing in a way their campaign hopes will connect with working class voters. But Vance is firmly in Trump's so-called MAGA camp of the Republican Party, and others have reportedly expressed \"buyer's remorse\" in the wake of Harris's ascension, given the need to appeal to independent and swing voters in critical states. Vance's cause might not have been helped by the resurfacing of a 2021 interview in which he argued the US was being run \"by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they've made\". He went on to name several Democrats, including Harris, asking: \"How does it make any sense that we've turned our country over to people who don't really have a direct stake in it?\" Former secretary of state and Democrats presidential candidate Hillary Clinton shared the clip on X, sarcastically describing Vance as \"a normal, relatable guy who certainly doesn't hate women having freedoms\". While the actor Jennifer Aniston — who has spoken openly about her difficulties with IVF — posted a message on Instagram saying: \"I truly can't believe this is coming from a potential VP of the United States.\" A spokesperson for Vance hit back at the criticism, highlighting the senator's openness about his success being due \"in large part to the influence of strong female role models like his grandmother\". But winning over American women who've mobilised in the two years since Trump's Supreme Court picks helped to end the nation-wide right to abortion has always presented a challenge for the former president. With the election again re-set after an already tumultuous few weeks, both sides are scrambling to gain ground just a few months out from polling day.","summary":"As Joe Biden starts his long goodbye with a televised address from the Oval Office, Donald Trump and his likely rival in November's presidential election, Kamala Harris, have been trading blows, as a recast race for the White House begins.","url":"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-07-26/joe-biden-vp-kamala-harris-sharpening-attacks-on-donald-trump/104144446","image":"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/fed404c4f15e51bb61ed9822573cd3eb?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=1680&cropW=2983&xPos=17&yPos=0&width=862&height=485","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:39:28","author":"Jade Macmillan","authors":["Jade Macmillan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.1},{"id":252644452,"title":"Trump testing out attack lines on Harris","text":"Trump testing out attack lines on Harris While Democrats are rallying behind Vice President Kamala Harris, Republicans are already attacking her record both on the airwaves and on the campaign trail.

Claims out of Bidenworld have it that he’s convinced Kamala can’t win — and is spitting mad that Joe jumped the gun on crowning her as his replacement; ‘Bam had wanted several candidates to compete, with a winner chosen at the convention. But the party, doubtless exhausted after weeks of tension over whether Biden would drop, rushed to embrace Harris to end the drama. And Democrats figure Harris is a (relatively) fresh face; though her approval ratings are as low as Biden’s, they’re surely not as firmly locked in. The same messaging machine (including most of the media) that covered up Biden’s decline can now turn (shamelessly) to covering her flaws. They only have to make it work for the bit over four months to Election Day, and they’ve already got a social-media blitz going. Thing is, Kamala’s flaws are many: She’s crashed and burned while trying to discuss policy almost as often as Joe. She has little experience actually governing, and she’s thrown her support behind lefty causes, like The Green New Deal and defunding the police, that centrist Americans oppose. Not to mention the “border czar” fiasco — and her media enablers have already burned themselves trying to memory-hole that. Nor is it clear how much the public trusts the press after the Biden revelations. Plus, Harris’ former staffers (and she’s gone through a lot of them) routinely complain that she doesn’t do her homework, then blames her minions when she’s caught out. Doesn’t bode well for live interviews (perhaps a repeat of her meltdown with Lester Holt?) nor for debating Donald Trump. To be clear: Switching out Joe for Kamala ups the challenge for the Trump-Vance ticket; polls suggest the race is already tighter, and the Dems’ convention, including her VP pick, might tighten it up more. Republicans are still feeling out the right tone to attack a nominee who’s a black woman: Dems will call them racist and sexist no matter what, but the voters will judge for themselves. Yet she may still bomb, and forcing out one nominee is surely the limit or Democrats will lose the “democracy” issue entirely. We’ll likely never know for sure if Obama really wanted Sen. Mark Kelly or whoever, but we do know he’s a smart guy. And we suspect the early coronation of Kamala Harris will prove not that smart.","summary":"While endorsements for Kamala Harris pile up from all corners of the Democratic Party, there's one glaring omission: Barack Obama.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/opinion/barack-obamas-instincts-that-kamala-isnt-a-winner-are-spot-on/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-vju7cgyys-1721948929894.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721934647&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:36:14","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.42},{"id":252643514,"title":"Illinois Gov.

Pritzker is or is not being vetted as a possible vice presidential candidate for Kamala Harris. President Joe Biden announced Sunday he was not seeking reelection. He later endorsed Vice President Harris to be the nominee. Democratic leaders, including Pritzker, followed suit with endorsements of Harris. Alongside the names of Democratic governors from several other states, Pritzker’s name was brought up in reports earlier this week as a potential vice presidential candidate. Tuesday, Pritzker told MSNBC he had not received any vetting materials. Wednesday, he told CNN he wouldn’t share anything from private conversations he’s had and if asked to be the running mate it would be hard to resist such a call. In front of other media Thursday in Chicago, Pritzker continued fielding questions seeking clarification of who he’s talked to and about what. “As I’ve said, I’m not going to talk about any conversations we’ve had,” Pritzker said. “I haven’t talked to the campaign the way you’ve described, just spoke with Vice President Harris.” Pritzker then had to clarify that statement. “Sorry, I think the question was had I spoken with them in the last day, did I get a call, and the answer is no,” Pritzker said. The governor then went on to say that he doesn’t know anyone working in Democratic politics who has not talked to the Harris campaign. He knows people who work on the campaign and is involved in transmitting the message of the campaign. The governor was then asked directly Thursday: “Have you been contacted about becoming vice president?” “Again, I’m not going to talk about that,” Pritzker said. “I can tell you that, like, I’m going to campaign. Whatever happens in this process that I understand is going on, my job is to make sure that we win in November, so I’m going to work hard to do that as I have for, gosh, the last year and a half in this campaign.” Democrats will officially select their candidates for president and vice president at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago next month.","summary":"Questions persist around whether Illinois Gov.

I was worried about Joe Biden stepping aside. But now it seems to be going well. Kamala Harris certainly has the experience to put Donald Trump where he belongs — never to step into the White House again. Trump has taken away women’s rights. He got the Supreme Court to give him almost full immunity, which includes not being subject to the rule of law. We should all be aware of Trump’s Agenda 47 and his Project 2025. If those things come to pass, we will descend even further into an autocracy, which is all he wants: nothing for the American people, all for him.

Add the diatribes, the unrelenting conviction that the 2020 election was fraudulent, the crackpot economic pronouncements, the war-ending, wand-waving dreams. Refute Tinsley with the recorded evidence. Trump and Vance are menaces whose words should be displayed in bold print.

Disappointedly, more than 14 million children received no vaccine at all last year. GAVI, The Vaccine Alliance was established in 2000 to save lives, decrease poverty, and protect the world against the threat of epidemics and pandemics by increasing the equitable and sustainable use of vaccines. The success of GAVI has proven substantial. Prior to 2000 approximately 10 million children died each year prior to their fifth birthday. Since 2000, GAVI has helped vaccinate more than 1 billion children in 78 lower-income countries preventing more than a projected 17.3 million future deaths. On June 20 in Paris, first lady Dr. Jill Biden announced a U.S. pledge of at least $1.58 billion to GAVI over five years.

This fact is undeniable, no matter how much dishonest media try to obfuscate it: President Joe Biden appointed the vice president to stem the tide of migrants to the U.S. southern border. Period. No wiggle room. And the almost inarguable judgment is that she failed at the job. Miserably. The tide didn’t recede; it rose and crashed in huge waves upon our (figurative) shores. It was way back on March 24, 2021. Biden, in a White House meeting that included Harris, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, and Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra, announced he was tapping Harris to lead the administration’s response to the growing number of migrants arriving at the U.S. border. Her job, he said, was “stemming the migration to our southern border.” He also said she “agreed to lead our diplomatic effort and work with nations [to our South] to accept re- — the returnees, and enhance migration enforcement at their borders — at their borders.” Biden told reporters before the meeting that he wanted Harris to be the point person on the border, to speak decisively for the administration. And in a call to reporters after the announcement, a senior official told reporters unequivocally that Harris’s focus would be on the historic surge of illegal border crossings. Within hours stories emerged in major news organizations with clarity that “Biden was tasking her with leading efforts to stem migration and the border” with dozens of elite news organizations referring to her as the “border czar.” This is irrefutable history. It’s all documented. Nonetheless, one hour after Biden endorsed Harris last Sunday, news organizations and Democrats were stridently saying it was never the case that Harris was in charge of the border, that they never said she was the border czar and that the claim was all a right-wing conspiracy. Axios, a popular Washington insider online news organization, not only scrubbed part of its story from 2021 reporting Harris was “appointed by Biden as border czar,” but also said in an editor’s note that it had “incorrectly” labeled Harris a border czar. At least it admitted it originally called her that. It was one of the most remarkably dishonest moments in American journalism, a once revered industry that in recent years has lost the trust of the people to report the news in a full, fair, and accurate way. And it wasn’t just Axios. The gaslighting of readers across multiple news organizations has been equally repulsive — and it may just be the final straw in that relationship between readers and news organizations. The New York Times admonished readers Thursday saying, “Ms. Harris was not in fact appointed border czar, nor was she tasked with addressing the border problems plaguing the border itself.” That is not what Biden said. That is not what the press wrote and said. Simply put they were either lying then or they are lying now. For years the national press has had what they referred to as “disinformation beats” and used them to rush to say that social media platforms should not feature certain news stories or news outlets, almost all of them center-right or conservative, on their sites. And now they are engaged in disinformation that discredits their own reporting. They need to call themselves out for disinformation. Either they’re lying now, or they were lying then. They called Harris the border czar at the time, and now they’re saying she wasn’t the border czar. That means they weren’t very good reporters at the time. And so, they need to address their reporters who called Harris the wrong thing. It’s a statement that their own product was wrong or it’s wrong now. It’s one or the other. What they don’t understand is that most people are smarter than that, and that their takeaway is, “Oh, you just want to help her.” Because rest assured, if we had no immigration problem, Harris would be running on the fact that she’s the border czar, and everybody knows it. The same goes for the “non-partisan” GovTrack, an organization that touts itself as a government transparency website that tracks congressional voting records, who in the dark of night Wednesday decided to scrub their 2019 rating of Harris as the most liberal U.S. senator in the upper chamber. GovTrack founder Joshua Tauberer told Fox News the page was removed because it was not “a reliable portrait of the activity of legislators.” Run that by us again? He says the same rating that is GovTrack’s stock in trade, one that has been on site for years, suddenly is not accurate? If her rating is not accurate, doesn’t that throw into question GovTrack’s entire rating system? It can’t be inaccurate for just her, but not for 99 other senators. The truth is that it absolutely was correct all along, but now it’s so embarrassing to their candidate that GovTrack is falling on its own sword. Yet the reality is that if voters were not rejecting the far-left spiral that Biden has embraced since becoming president, Harris would indeed be running on her rating as the most liberal senator in the country. In short, two storied institutions, who are supposed to operate at the highest level of reliability, not only scrubbed any evidence of their original reporting and rankings but somehow expected the general public to be okay with it. All because the candidate the institutions prefer would be damaged by past reporting or rankings. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER All of this reporting was good until they now pretend it wasn’t. And rather than stand behind their reporting, they are trying to pretend that it didn’t happen. Which makes you wonder, were they terrible at reporting then, or is it just now? In the words of Al Gore, the fact that Harris is the border czar is an inconvenient truth. No matter how much they try to get rid of the inconvenience, the truth, inviolable, remains.","summary":"Facts are facts, even if they make new presidential candidate Kamala Harris look bad.

Golden State Warriors superstar Stephen Curry spoke glowingly of the Oakland-born Harris in a news conference on Thursday ahead of the U.S. men’s basketball team’s first group-stage game against Serbia. “It’s a very interesting time for our country, for sure,” Curry said. “The fact that President Biden gave the endorsement, Vice President Harris is primed to bring her energy to this campaign and, hopefully if she’s on the ticket, winning the election. It’s a big deal, to say the least.” Harris, a longtime Warriors fan, met with the U.S. men’s team after a training camp practice earlier this month. Curry said he hopes a gold medal performance in Paris can help bring positive energy to Harris and bring the country together ahead of the election. “She represents the Bay Area. She’s been a big supporter of us, so I want to give that energy back to her,” he said. “We’re representing our country here, and this is a very monumental next couple of months for the direction where we’re headed. Hopefully, this is a great way to do our part to continue unifying our country with how sports brings a lot of people together. For her, in this moment, knowing what’s ahead, it’s all about positive energy and optimism, knowing how divided our country is right now. [I’m] just excited for the journey ahead for her.” Following President Joe Biden’s announcement last weekend that he will not run for a second term, Harris earned the endorsement of Biden and many other prominent Democrats as the party’s nominee to go against Republican nominee and former President Donald Trump in November’s election. Despite Harris still needing to earn the nomination from delegates at the Democratic National Convention in August, she is favored to be the party’s candidate. Warriors head coach Steve Kerr also voiced his support for Harris, telling reporters on Thursday, “Kamala Harris is a great candidate and I will support her.” Curry will look to lead Team USA to its fifth consecutive Olympic gold medal. This year’s team is one of the more talented rosters the U.S. has put together, featuring the likes of Curry, LeBron James, Kevin Durant, Jayson Tatum, Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis and Devin Booker. While still favored to win gold, the U.S. will face stiff competition. France, Greece, Spain, Canada, Serbia and South Sudan all boast teams with NBA talent that could challenge the U.S. in different ways. The U.S. went 5-0 in lead-up games, but three wins came by six points or less. The American’s opening game against Serbia is scheduled for 8:15 a.m. on Sunday.","summary":"\"For her, in this moment, knowing what’s ahead, it’s all about positive energy and optimism, knowing how divided our country is right now.

Censori additionally slipped into a pair of closed-toed, black heels that were secured with thin straps that wrapped around her ankles. Her short, brunette locks were parted to the side, and fell down in natural waves to nearly brush the tips of her shoulders.

She was seen arriving to the legendary venue on Thursday while stepping out of a sleek, Tesla Cybertruck West - who is also known as Ye - joined his wife for the lunch date and opted for an all-black ensemble that comprised of a black hoodie and comfy sweatpants. The performer also slipped into a pair of black shoes while also sporting black shades and a bracelet in his left wrist. Censori's return to the Chateau Marmont in another daring look comes shortly after an insider revealed whether the architect was welcome at the hotel - which costs around a whopping $774-a-night. A valet at the landmark told DailyMail.com on Wednesday, 'She comes here all the time. I always know when she's here because there's always a lot of paparazzi.' 'She comes a lot. She stayed here awhile, a few months I think, and last time she was here was before the weekend, Tuesday or Wednesday.' In regards to her risqué looks when paying a visit to the hotel, the valet revealed, 'She always dresses like that.'

(WSVN) — Ahead of the meeting between former President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, authorities said security is a top priority for the area. Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw said preparations are underway for a smooth meeting between the two leaders. “We’re well trained at this. We protected the president for four years here. We’ve never had a glitch,” he said. Bradshaw said that despite the assassination attempt on July 13 on former President Trump’s life, his office is ready for Netanyahu’s visit. “There’s a lot of apprehension out here, I think, right now, about presidential visits and dignitaries, given what happened in [Pennsylvania],” said Bradshaw. Bradshaw said that when Netanyahu arrives on Friday, Southern Boulevard will be closed to get him from the airport to Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. During that ride, demonstrators who wish to protest the visit will be allowed on both sides of the roadway, but the sheriff said there is one big limit. “Don’t go in the road, folks. That’s a no-no, all right?” said Bradshaw. “I know some of the protesters like to shut roads down and make a statement. That ain’t gonna happen here. We’re not going to allow it.” His comments about pro-Palestinian protesters come after some of the protests outside the U.S. Capitol turned destructive on Wednesday while Netanyahu was giving an address to a joint session of Congress. Netanyahu continued his Washington, D.C., trip with a sit-down meeting with both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. “From a proud Jewish Zionist to an Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 59 years of support for the state of Israel,” said Netanyahu. The two leaders spoke about the latest efforts to reach a cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel, a war that has killed thousands of Palestinians, with at least 100 Israelis still held captive. “My message to Benjamin Netanyahu is very simple: go for the deal that would release all the hostages, along with a cease-fire. We need loved ones back home,” said Yehuda Cohen, the father of a hostage being held by Hamas. As Netanyahu lands in Palm Beach on Friday, Trump had some advice to the prime minister. “You have to end this fast. It can’t continue to go on like this. It’s too long,” said Trump in a Fox News interview. The sheriff also said there will be correction vans set up in case anybody gets too rowdy or blocks the roads. He also praised the Secret Service and said he has the utmost confidence in the agency. Copyright 2024 Sunbeam Television Corp. All rights reserved.

In a sign of Biden passing the torch, it was Harris, not the sitting president, who delivered a speech before a backdrop of American flags after her meeting with Netanyahu and outlined the path forward to a ceasefire deal. Biden met earlier with Netanyahu but the pair spoke only briefly on camera. Harris called her talk with Netanyahu “frank” and acknowledged how the conflict began last October when Hamas militants infiltrated southern Israel and murdered some 1,200 people, with an estimated 250 taken captive back to Gaza. “I repeat: Israel has a right to defend itself, and how it does so matters,” Harris said. “Hamas is a brutal terrorist organization. On Oct. 7, Hamas triggered this war when it massacred 1,200 innocent people, including 44 Americans.” The vice president, Biden’s chosen successor after he dropped his reelection bid on Sunday, went on to name each American hostage and speak about her meetings with the families. “I have met with the families of these American families many times now, and I’ve told them each time they are not alone and I stand with them,” she said. Harris has been more outspoken and has emerged as a forceful voice on the Israel-Hamas war, particularly in discussing the humanitarian situation in Gaza. She said she reiterated those concerns to Netanyahu. “I also expressed with the Prime Minister, my serious concern about the scale of human suffering in Gaza, including the death of far too many innocent civilians,” Harris said. “What has happened in Gaza over the past nine months is devastating.” After declining to preside over Netanyahu’s speech to Congress on Wednesday due to a scheduling conflict, her meeting comes as the Biden administration is looking to find an exit strategy to the nine-month-old war in Gaza. “It is time for this war to end and to end in a way where Israel is secure, all the hostages are released, the suffering of Palestinians in Gaza ends and the Palestinian people can exercise their right to freedom, dignity, and self-determination,” she said. Netanyahu met earlier in the day with Biden and with families of the hostages. The prime minister’s visit comes as U.S. officials have expressed optimism about the prospect of a deal to return hostages to their families and end the war. Detailed ceasefire negotiations surrounding a framework agreement are now stretching into their third week. Biden emphasized in his Oval Office meeting with Netanyahu that he wants Israel and Hamas to quickly agree to a ceasefire deal that would bring home the remaining hostages, according to White House national security spokesman John Kirby. The families of American hostages emphasized to both leaders that time is of the essence. “We came today with a sense of urgency; as you know, as time goes forward, the likelihood of getting our hostages home, our loved ones home, and recovering the bodies of those who have already been murdered becomes less and less likely,” Jonathan Dekel-Chen, the father of Sagui Dekel-Chen, said. “So, as families, we came in and really emphasized to the leaders of the United States and Israel a desire to get this deal done.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER The number of Palestinians killed since the start of the conflict has exceeded 39,000, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health. The toll cannot be verified and does not differentiate between civilians and fighters. “They are definitely working on a proposal; it’s going to come out very soon. We believe both parties are working and understand the urgency, and it’s going to come out to the public,” Ronen Neutra, father of Omer Neutra, said.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris, on the brink of becoming the Democratic nominee, acknowledged the suffering of both the Israeli and Palestinian people during a solo meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, pledging not to &#8220;look away in the face of these tragedies.&#8221; &#8220;We cannot allow ourselves to&#160;be&#160;numb to the suffering, and&#160;I will&#160;not&#160;be&#160;silent,&#8221; Harris said [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3100137/harris-says-will-not-be-silent-gaza-suffering-meeting-netanyahu/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24207771942952-scaled.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:21:41","author":"Samantha-Jo Roth","authors":["Samantha-Jo Roth"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":252643098,"title":"Kamala Harris Takes Clear Stance After Meeting With Netanyahu","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris adamantly called for a ceasefire to the war in Gaza following her meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday.Harris told reporters after her meeting in Washington, D.C., that she told the Israeli leader that \"it is time\" to reach an end to the war and bring those kidnapped during Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel home.

Asked about a Politico report about a closed-door meeting on Tuesday morning in which party leaders begged lawmakers to stop attacking Harris on the basis of identity, Jean-Pierre replied, “When you have the Speaker of the House [Mike Johnson]… set up a meeting to tell Republican leaders to stop being racist, to stop being misogynist, to stop being sexist, I think that says a lot that they have to be told to not do that. “But more broadly,” she continued, “I think it’s—I think it’s desperate.

Tim Burchett (R-TN) whined that Harris was “100 percent” a diversity hire in a CNN appearance on Monday. “Biden said, first off, he said he’s going to hire a Black female for vice-president. What about white females? What about any other group?” he asked. “When you go down that route, you take mediocrity, and that’s what they have right now with the vice president.” Hours earlier, Rep.

Her ethnicity, her gender, has nothing to do with this whatsoever.”","summary":"Jim Watson/AFP via Getty ImagesWhite House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre pointed out on Thursday that it speaks volumes that Republican congressional leaders had to admonish members to refrain from “being racist” and sexist towards Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nAsked about a Politico report about a closed-door meeting on Tuesday morning in which party leaders begged lawmakers to stop attacking Harris on the basis of identity, Jean-Pierre replied, “When you have the Speaker of the House [Mike Johnson]… set up a meeting to tell Republican leaders to stop being racist, to stop being misogynist, to stop being sexist, I think that says a lot that they have to be told to not do that.\n\n“But more broadly,” she continued, “I think it’s—I think it’s desperate.

At least that’s the takeaway from two new national surveys dropped Thursday showing the race with Donald Trump is too close to call. The New York Times-Siena College sampling of 1,142 likely voters shows the Republican nominee with a marginal lead over the Democratic vice president — 48% to 47% with leaners factored in — and giving every indication the race for the White House could have a photo finish in November. The NYT-Siena survey shows that both Trump and Harris command intraparty loyalty, with 93% of Republicans and Democrats saying they’re behind their party’s standard bearer. Harris has a slight edge with independent voters in a two-way race, with 47% backing the veep, 45% behind Trump and 7% up for grabs. When the field is expanded to include Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and other marginal candidates like Libertarian Chase Oliver, the Green Party’s Jill Stein and independent Cornel West, the Siena survey is more sterling still for Harris. She leads Trump 44% to 43% in that expanded field, with the support of 89% of Democrats, 70% of black voters, 52% of Hispanic voters, and 51% of women. While she doesn’t have a majority of independents, with 41% backing her in the larger field many voters will see on their ballots this fall, she’s 4 points ahead of Trump with that subgroup. The poll evenly sampled Republicans and Democrats, at 33% each, with independents 29% of the participants. In another poll of 1,170 registered voters, which YouGov and the Times of London conducted after Biden withdrew from the race but before his Wednesday night address from the Oval Office, the race is also too close to call. Trump leads Harris by just 2 points, 46% to 44%, with the marginal candidates shedding vote share as seems to happen every four years. Kennedy is at a lowly 4% in this sample, with Stein at 1% and the hapless Cornel West mired at 0%. As poll watchers know, there are key differences between registered voter and likely voter models, but some things remain the same. Even those surveyed who don’t claim to be fully committed to voting are loyal to their party’s picks, with 92% of Republicans backing Trump and 91% of Democrats behind Harris. Independents in this poll skew toward Trump, meanwhile, but not overwhelmingly: 45% to 37%, with Kennedy taking 8% of unaligned voters, Stein 2% and West 1%. Gender splits take center stage here also, with 54% of men backing Trump and 51% of women supporting Harris. Democrats have been messaging heavily on reproductive rights since the 2022 Dobbs decision, which Harris and others blame Trump for, given that his three Supreme Court picks drove the reversal of Roe v. Wade. Expect messaging along these lines through Election Day from the Harris team. While Trump has 54% support among white voters, the YouGov/Times of London poll nonetheless suggests his won’t be a rainbow coalition. Only 12% of black voters back the former president, with 72% on side for Harris. Trump has spent some time this cycle trying to juice the African-American vote, but those efforts haven’t paid off in this survey. Hispanic voters are leaning Harris here also, 44% to 40%. Against Biden in many polls, Trump ran even or was actually ahead. But this is a new presidential race. And it’s anyone’s guess who will prevail.","summary":"While Democrats have gone through a month of anxiety about their electoral chances in the presidential race, it appears substituting Kamala Harris for Joe Biden atop the ticket hasn’t hurt the incumbent party at all.

Sacks wrote in a post that during the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Biden was in “no danger of being deposed” but was “actually deposed,” when he stepped down as the party’s presumptive nominee this Sunday, calling the move a “coup.” You were sanctioned by the SEC. Nobody else, only you. But you’ve spent the last decade trying to shift the blame onto others for your own poor ethics. ? pic.twitter.com/j3F8A3boFH— David Sacks (@DavidSacks) July 24, 2024 The mention of a coup prompted Conrad to reply. “Let me tell you, coups are this man’s speciality,” Conrad posted, recalling the acrimonious falling out the men had nearly a decade ago while at a software startup. The background to the brief sparring session is the two worked together at Zenefits, a startup founded by Conrad where he was CEO. Sacks was an investor in the company and served as COO. In 2016, Conrad and Zenefits encountered compliance issues that ultimately resulted in an SEC settlement and his departure from the company. While the argument on X this week quickly turned personal, with Sacks and Conrad reliving their years-old feud, it started because of a post that’s emblematic of an industrywide rift that is distinctly contemporary. The November election between Trump and Harris has divided Silicon Valley in ways previous elections haven’t. A growing contingent of high-profile industry leaders—Sacks, Elon Musk, and venture capitalist pairing Marc Andreesen and Ben Horowitz— have thrown their support behind Trump. That, in and of itself, is a surprising development for the tech industry, which is centered in the traditionally liberal Bay Area and has historically backed Democrats. Harris, a Bay Area politician herself, is familiar to many tech executives, whom she has both regulated and courted for donations. Sacks did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune. Conrad, through a spokesperson for his current company, Rippling, declined to comment for this article. Zenefits was an HR software company that also acted as a health insurance brokerage firm. However, the company ran into trouble when Buzzfeed alleged that Conrad wrote a computer script that made it appear as though some brokers had completed a legally required training course when they hadn’t. Ultimately, in 2017 the SEC settled with Zenefits and Conrad for a combined $1 million for “materially false and misleading statements and omissions.” (Conrad and the company neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing as part of the settlement.) On X, Sacks brushed off Conrad’s mention of their shared history. “You were sanctioned by the SEC,” Sacks wrote on X with a screenshot of Conrad’s reply. “Nobody else, only you. But you’ve spent the last decade trying to shift the blame onto others for your own poor ethics.” That’s when Paul Graham chimed in on X to offer his two cents. (Graham, a veteran tech investor, is best known for starting the wildly successful startup incubator Y Combinator.) “Do you really want the full story of what you did to Parker to be told publicly?” Graham replied to Sacks. “Because it’s the worst case of an investor maltreating a founder that I’ve ever heard, and I’ve heard practically all of them.” Graham did not respond to a request for comment from Fortune. While at Y Combinator, Graham funded hundreds of startups, as spots in the incubator became increasingly competitive and coveted. Over his career he’s worked with the likes of Airbnb founder Brian Chesky, Dropbox founders Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi, and the Collison brothers, who founded Stripe. Sacks dismissed Graham, saying the two had never met or worked together, and accused Conrad of “publicly fuming and smearing me.” Others leapt to Conrad’s defense, with former journalist and tech watcher Eric Newcomer accusing Sacks of unfairly blaming Conrad for company problems. Conrad maintains he was unfairly forced out of the company he started. In a 2022 interview, Conrad said that, after he agreed to step down from Zenefits to be replaced by Sacks, the duo, in conjunction with the board, drafted a “friendly” press release announcing his departure. Conrad said he was blindsided when, a few hours after he signed the paperwork to resign, Sacks issued a press release blaming him for Zenefits’ problems. On Thursday, Sacks seemed ready to move on from the issue. “Personally I think it’s a huge waste of time to still be talking about this a decade later,” he wrote on X.","summary":"A politically charged mention of “coups” brought back David Sacks’ ousting of Parker Conrad from the startup he founded.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/a-post-about-kamala-harris-pushed-a-long-simmering-feud-between-tech-execs-into-the-open/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2161586982-e1721940077538.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:07:06","author":"Paolo Confino","authors":["Paolo Confino"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.538},{"id":252642618,"title":"Kamala Harris Joins TikTok","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris, who is now running for president in 2024 against Donald Trump, on Thursday launched her own account on social-entertainment app TikTok.

But, the question is will a second term be the same as the ex-president's first term, or this time round, some family members will have a more influential presence in the Oval Office than others? The Republican National Convention gave an insight into the family's current political hierarchy. The Milwaukee event had MAGA supporters chanting \"Fight!\" as the politician emerged after recovering from an assassination attempt. His political allies and family members cheered for him as the GOP wrapped up the day with a rather un-Trump speech style. However, noticeably, almost every family member was present at the convention except his youngest Barron Trump. During the RNC, his eldest son Don Jr. was omnipresent. He is currently serving as executive vice president of the Trump Organization and he spoke at length about his father's near-death experience and the MAGA campaign's future plans if re-elected. Don Jr. has emerged as Trump's staunch supporter and arguably he's been more politically active campaigning for his father, openly criticizing his rivals Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, and ensuring he change the narrative around the former president like a loyal son. It has also been reported that JD Vance, Trump's running mate is a good friend of Don Jr. Corey Lewandowski, who ran Trump's campaign in 2016 and is also on board for the 2024 campaign, told USA Today, \"I think Don Jr. is the one who delivers his father's message most closely to the way he would do it. He has a massive following… and Don. Jr truly loves this stuff, I mean that's what he does.\" Meanwhile, former First Daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared Kushner, who were the controversial senior advisors during Trump's administration from 2017 to 2021, appeared low-key throughout the convention. The couple came on the last night of the RNC and were not among the keynote speakers. They briefly joined Trump on stage and clearly wouldn't be active members of Trump's upcoming administration. Moving onto the ex-commander-in-chief's Slovenian wife Melania Trump who's been a silent supporter throughout her husband's political career. Although she too, like Ivanka, joined her husband on stage to show her support, it is unlikely that she'd break her \"private person\" image as one source said she's \"through a lot\" lately like losing her mother and watching her husband being nearly killed. Tiffany, Eric, and his wife Lara Trump have also been using their platforms to amplify MAGA voices. While Tiffany, Trump's daughter with ex-wife Marla Maples, hasn't been an active political figure, she frequently graces events to support her father. During the RNC, Eric's wife Lara told the crowd, \"Maybe you got to see a side of Donald Trump on Saturday that you were not sure existed until you saw it with your own eyes,\" per BBC. The 18-year-old Barron who recently graduated from school is set to go to college and made his first-ever debut at Trump's rally in Miami. Although there have been reports that the youngest son has political inclinations and had also been announced as a delegate for his father in Florida, it was speculated that his \"fiercely protective\" mother, Melania objected. So, who'd take on a more active role in Trump's second-term administration? Charlie Kirk, the founder of the youth-focused Turning Point USA, said, \"I think they'll all be influential.\"","summary":"For Donald Trump, the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee was a family affair with nearly every member in attendance.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-second-term-administration-could-allow-these-family-members-to-have-the-most-influence","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/707200/uploads/7c8f7990-4a63-11ef-be28-7322a0db7321_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:01:33","author":"INQUISITR,Juwairiya Shariq","authors":["INQUISITR","Juwairiya Shariq"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.193},{"id":252642526,"title":"No tickets? No problem","text":"PARIS (AP) – Sip a cool drink in Brazil. Sample a spicy samosa in India. Boogie down with a DJ in France ’til the early hours. Or, do all three in a day – and perhaps meet some athletes, too. If you’re in Paris but don’t have tickets for the Olympics, organisers want you to know that you can spend your days – and nights, too – at the Parc des Nations, or Nations Park, which is hosting 15 festive national team clubhouses in what amounts to a mini-World’s Fair on the edge of Paris. The project gives a temporary new name to Parc de la Villette, a sprawling 55-hectare space in the northeastern corner of the capital. It opens tomorrow, once today’s ambitious opening ceremony on the Seine River is over, along with its enormous security demands. Imagine one huge, multicultural fan zone. The idea is for visitors to connect with each other, with Olympic athletes (who will come for medal celebrations) and with the Games themselves, organisers said. “The slogan of these Olympics is ‘Games Wide Open’, and we wanted to bring that to life,” said Amelie Guignabert of Paris 2024, the Olympic organising committee. “We really believe in it.” All they need, she noted, is the fans – and officials are advertising in the Paris Metro and elsewhere. Certainly, there is room for them. The biggest house is not surprisingly, Club France, where there is capacity for 5,000 to 6,000 people inside and 20,000 in the outside spaces, which include two huge fields. Other team clubhouses are Casa Brazil, Canada Team House, Casa Colombia, Czech House, India House, Casa Mexico, Team NL (Netherlands) House, Mongolia House, Serbian House, Slovak House, Slovenian House, Chinese Taipei Pavilion, Volia Space (Ukraine) and Ekhaya South Africa. Inside Club France is a large stage, where athletes will appear after winning medals and where nightly music events will be offered, including sets from DJs like Bob Sinclar, said Arnaud Courtier, executive director of Club France. “We like to party,” he said. Fans can pay EUR5 (USD5.42) and stay as long as they like, watching Olympic competitions on a giant screen and athlete interviews, cheering medal winners and buying food and drink. Or, they can buy a package that could run up to EUR385 for an all-night open establishment and a prime spot on the stage. Outside are some 20 makeshift pavilions designed by architecture students that house various French sports federations. Among other activities, visitors will be able to learn from coaches and try their hand at sports. The project started with a decision to put Club France at La Villette, said the park’s general director Sophie-Justine Lieber. Then, countries that didn’t have clubs elsewhere decided to join in. The park, with its many structures, was able to accommodate particular needs – for example, Slovenia and the Czech Republic wanted places with kitchens to emphasise their national cuisines, and Mongolia wanted outdoor space to erect yurts, the traditional circular dwellings. As for beach volleyball? That’s an attraction at Brazil’s house, along with music like samba and funk. And, of course, pao de queijo, the Brazilian cheese bread. Organisers at India’s pavilion announced it was the country’s first house at an Olympics, a step towards their dream of bringing the Games one day to India. India House spares no effort to highlight the country’s rich culture – it has brought in a huge loom, for example, where artisans are weaving traditional saris and carpets. Among many exhibits, one wall displays Gond art from the state of Madhya Pradesh, along with photos of every Indian athlete competing this year. A key face among them: javelin thrower Neeraj Chopra, a star in India who has nine million Instagram followers. There will be Indian food, of course – samosas, spiced chai tea, savoury dhokla and more. Bollywood music will play, and fans will be able to try yoga and cricket. Organiser B Srinivasan, greeting the media on Tuesday evening, declared these Games a perfect moment to introduce a new India and pointed to the many notables India has exported to the world – including political figures with Indian heritage like Rishi Sunak, the former British prime minister. And, in the most timely of references, Kamala Harris, the United States vice president who is now running for the top job after President Joe Biden ended his campaign for a second term. – Jocelyn Noveck","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/no-tickets-no-problem/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/page-24-f_26072024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:01:30","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.419},{"id":252642532,"title":"Media is embracing Stalinist tactics to erase Kamala’s leftist senate record","text":"After Lenin died, most people who wanted to keep their heads got into lockstep behind Stalin. Leon Trotsky didn’t, and he paid the price with an ice axe to the brain. The Great Purge followed. Stalin and Trotsky were expert at eliminating opposition to communist rule and “converting” those who had voiced a less-than-enthusiastic support for their power. Newspapers that wrote anything that wasn’t effusive support disappeared. Editors were sent to the Gulags. Journalists disappeared or were given a choice. Support us, or disappear. Stalin had a habit of disappearing the past. Before Photoshop, there was Stalin and his airbrush team and goons who would rewrite history. There is a famous before and after photo of Stalin and a henchman standing next to the Volga River. That man was the head of the NKVD (The People’s Commissariat for Internal Affairs), Nikolai Yezhov. Yezhov’s image was airbrushed out of photos. One such photo has become something of a meme for erasing history. After Joe Biden was forced out of running for president, the power elites in the Democrat Party anointed Kamala Harris as the party’s pick. In 2020, she was inept at campaigning. Her positions were so scattered and so far left that even Democrats hated her. She was forced out before the Iowa Caucus. In 2024, without a single vote, she has been anointed as the next Obama. The party has a number of problems with the undemocratically picked Kamala Harris, not the least of which is that, as noted, she didn’t get a single person to vote for her. But the lapdog media knows that Harris’ biggest problem isn’t that the party apparatchik picked her; it is her record of being left of Bernie Sanders (I-VT) that they fear will be her undoing. Harris has a well-documented history of leftist positions that are as “AOC” as one can get. Recently, the “non-partisan” “GovTrack” has eliminated/scrubbed a page on its ranking that had Kamala Harris ranked as the most liberal senator in the U.S. Senate in 2019. There are plenty of leftists in the Senate, yet Harris was ranked ahead of Sanders, Chris Murphy (CT), and Chris Coons (DE). The media is entered hyperdrive on their Orwellian effort to scrub inconvenient information about Kamala Harris from existence. GovTrack is the latest. Here is the original entry 2019 for Harris, the new editor’s note for scrubbing the title “Most Liberal” Senator from the… pic.twitter.com/9BFnPyuFWM — Western Lensman (@WesternLensman) July 24, 2024 GovTrack has said that it took the page down not to hide Harris’ history of leftist positions and her leftist votes in the Senate but to change the ranking to include two years rather than one. When ranked over two years out of 100 Senators, Harris was ranked the second most liberal senator. CBS: “You’re considered the most liberal United States senator.” KAMALA: “I— somebody said that, and it was actually Mike Pence on the debate stage…” CBS: “Actually, nonpartisan GovTrack has rated you as the most liberal senator.” KAMALA: *blank stare* pic.twitter.com/rmcz43aNNb — RNC Research (@RNCResearch) July 24, 2024 And other media will soon be doing their part. Axios got the memo and has already started. Axios and its willing lackeys are editing pages and eliminating facts that make Harris look bad, i.e., modifying “history.” As we enter into the election homestretch, the left and its willing media will attempt to change the narrative or attempt to change written history. A perfect example of this effort is the claim that Harris was never “Border Czar.” Democrats and willing media are removing that title from her resume or refusing to talk about it. “Harris was never NAMED Border Czar…” Much like Bill Clinton trying to redefine “is,” media and “non-partisan” players will gaslight and spin Harris’s past and attempt to change history. We can look forward to gaslighting and spinning and page links disappearing, but Republicans will keep her failures front and center. Harris and her spin team can’t airbrush people out of photos like Stalin did. Those days are gone. The internet is forever. But what they can do is disappear pages from websites and hope that people have short memories. We aren’t the Soviet Union, and Harris isn’t Stalin. Stalin was a skilled politician and eventually had total control of the media. Sure, Harris has [most of] the media in her pocket, but she cannot erase history — her history is forever, even if there are toadies willing to erase pages on websites. Sorry, Dems, the internet is forever.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAfter Lenin died, most people who wanted to keep their heads got&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Media is embracing Stalinist tactics to erase Kamala&#8217;s leftist senate record first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/media-is-embracing-stalinist-tactics-to-erase-kamalas-leftist-senate-record/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Stalinist-Tactics-Are-on-Full-Display-Willing.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 23:00:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.2},{"id":252642896,"title":"Letters: Harris/Kelly | Strength in diversity | Decrease consumption","text":"Harris/Kelly ticket seems like winner I am sad that Joe Biden stepped down in his presidential bid under intense pressure. He is perhaps our greatest president in the last 75 years and would have been reelected. It was a mistake by the Democratic Party. Look at this man’s accomplishments: over 15 million jobs in 3½ years, the lowest unemployment of the last 50 years, re-engaged us in the Paris climate treaty, signed the infrastructure bill, and much more. Kamala Harris is the path forward. If the Democrats want to ensure a solid ticket that people can get behind, think Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly for vice president. This ticket would have great diversity and would not only energize the Democratic base but would get swing voters from Arizona. He is a decorated Navy captain, astronaut and popular senator. Having Joe Biden step down was a questionable move at best; a Harris/Kelly ticket would bring solace and a win.

The CrowdStrike outage underlines a key law in the IT world that has been broken regarding mission-critical redundancy: Be prepared and resilient. Any IT manager knows this. Having most of the world running the current versions of Windows or any one brand of OS is pure folly. Maybe we need legislation mandating that each critical industry run a unique OS. Run the MacOS which runs on a flavor of UNIX. Run RED HAT Linux. Run whatever but don’t have 99% of the world all run Windows. We only have to remember the 1950s agribusiness crisis when the entire Gros Michel banana crop was wiped out by the Panama disease fungus. Now we grow Cavendish bananas which are ready to be wiped out yet again by a new fungus. The lesson to be learned here is that there is strength in diversity. Michael Alvarado San Jose Humans must decrease wanton consumption Earth Overshoot Day is estimated to be Aug. 1. This date moves earlier every year as the human population continues to grow and consume. Overshoot Day marks when humanity’s demand for ecological resources and services, in a given year, exceeds what can regenerate in that year. We maintain this deficit by liquidating stocks of ecological resources and accumulating waste. The demand side includes a population’s demand for food and fiber products, livestock and fish products, timber and other forest products, mining, space for urban infrastructure, and forests to absorb carbon dioxide from fossil fuels. Impacts of ecological overspending are apparent already in soil erosion, desertification, reduced cropland productivity, overgrazing, deforestation, rapid species extinction, fisheries collapse and increased carbon concentration in the atmosphere. Humans need to decrease consumption and overpopulation.

In 2021, while running for the Senate, Vance explained what he saw as one of the biggest problems facing America: It’s being run “by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” He name-checked, among others, Vice President Kamala Harris. It’s a statement, as my colleague Jessica Grose writes, that shows the desperation of Republicans who are still “clinging to the tag line that the G.O.P. is the pro-family party.” But even for a red-meat, red-state Senate candidate, this was a remarkably harsh — and conspiracy-minded — insult to a large number of people: Around one in six American women 40 to 44 have never had children. It’s the kind of comment that makes you wonder if Vance thinks that he has been nominated by the Republican Party to serve as the vice president of the Republic of Gilead.

Chris Christie for badmouthing her endorsement of Donald Trump. “I wasn’t surprised and I didn’t take happiness in it,” Haley told CNN’s Jake Tapper on Thursday of Biden’s decision to end his re-election bid. “I think through the whole campaign I fought for mental competency tests. I wasn’t doing it to be disrespectful.” “I was doing it because I think it’s not just Joe Biden. There is an issue that we have in DC where people will go into office, and they won’t let go. And then their staffers and their family keep propping them up. And it’s a problem for the American people.” Back in February 2023, Haley, 52, launched her presidential bid with a call for mental competency tests for politicians over 75 and predicted that the GOP would be squaring off against Vice President Kamala Harris. “The first party to retire its 80-year-old candidate is going to be the one who wins this election,” she chided in January of this year. Ultimately that prognostication came true this past Sunday when Biden, 81, withdrew from the presidential race and paved the way for Harris, 59, to become the presumptive Democratic nominee for president. Biden did so in the wake of a pressure campaign among Democrats amid concerns over his mental acuity. “The Democrats are very smart to put in a younger candidate. I think that that’s what America has craved. But I think what you look at it they put in the weakest candidate they just put in,” she said with a smile when asked if she still believes the party that retired its 80-year-old will win. Haley then ticked through a laundry list of complaints against Harris, going through her past positions on the border, crime, foreign policy, and more. Both Haley and Harris are of Indian descent. Some Republicans have attacked Harris as a diversity, equity, and inclusion — DEI hire. That’s a reference to Biden publicly pledging to hire a female running mate. Some Republican leaders urged their colleagues to stop those attacks about DEI against Harris. “It’s not helpful. We’re talking about a liberal senator, who literally has not accomplished very much and what she was given she didn’t do much with,” Haley said. “You don’t need to talk about what she looks like. Or what gender she is.” Haley made waves last week when she officially endorsed former President Donald Trump, 78, at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. She had previously indicated that she planned to vote for him. “I owed the millions of people who supported me — they deserve to know who I’m going to vote for, and why I’m going to vote for him,” she explained. One of her old rivals, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, 61, sniped that her “speech was tortured ambition” and she did it because “she wants to run for president again.” Haley didn’t mince words on Christie, who infamously had a hot mic incident when he dropped out of the race before the New Hampshire primary and was heard badmouthing her. “I think it’s funny coming from a guy who didn’t even play in Iowa and couldn’t even get out of New Hampshire. I think he’s bitter to anybody that he’s ever dealt with,” she shot back. “It’s comical that it’s coming from a person who in 2016 literally did that one thing — fell all over himself for Trump to get a position in an administration and he still didn’t get it. I wish Chris well. I think he’s got a lot of torture demons inside of him.” She also denied the notion that she weathered significant pushback from Republicans who backed her in the primary over her backing of Trump. Haley further revealed that she does not have plans to campaign with him. Haley seemingly implied that Trump should also take a mental competency test given his age. Trump has boasted in the past about acing the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. “I have said — and it’s not just Donald Trump,” she said. “The American people deserve to know that everybody’s at the top of their game.” The former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the United Nations had been the last rival to Trump standing before she dropped out in March. Trump seethed at her for staying in so long, at one point he even questioned the whereabouts of her husband, Michael, who was deployed overseas. “For me, it’s not personal. I know Donald Trump. He’s gonna throw something just to kind of get people upset and I think he got pushback for that,” she said. “What I do feel bad is those that are serving.” Haley had exchanged her fair amount of fire with Trump on the campaign trail as well, calling him toxic and unhinged. She said he has no plans of taking that back. “I said a lot of tough things about him in the campaign. He said a lot of tough things about me in the campaign. That’s what happens in campaigns. I don’t think we need to apologize or take anything back,” she reflected. “I don’t plan on doing that.” The Palmetto State Republican expressed gratitude for those who supported and helped her 2024 bid. She also revealed that she has no plans at the moment to seek the presidency or a gig in a hypothetical Trump administration in the future. Haley also took note of vice presidential hopeful JD Vance’s (R-Ohio) position on Ukraine and acknowledged that the Republican Party is splintering on foreign policy. “I think that there’s a division in the Republican Party on where we should be on foreign policy especially. We have seen that play out with Ukraine. What I will tell you is, when Russia gets a little bit, they want a little bit more and a little bit more,” she warned.","summary":"Former Republican presidential hopeful Nikki Haley said she isn't gleeful that her prediction of President Biden dropping out came to fruition and lashed out at former New Jersey Gov.

Netanyahu’s first White House visit since 2020 comes a day after he gave a fiery speech to Congress and at a time of growing pressure in Israel and the U.S. to find an endgame to the nine-month conflict that’s left more than 39,000 dead in Gaza and some 1,200 dead in Israel. Dozens of Israeli hostages are still languishing in Hamas captivity. Harris said in remarks after what she called a “frank and constructive meeting” with the Israeli leader that she supports Israel’s right to defend itself, but said, “how it does so matters.” She expressed concern over the “devastating” humanitarian situation in Gaza and images of civilians killed in the conflict, saying, “We cannot look away in the face of these tragedies.” She echoed Biden in calling for a swift cease-fire to end the fighting, at least for a time, to boost humanitarian aid to Gaza and release some of the most vulnerable hostages from Hamas captivity. White House officials say the negotiations are in the closing stages, but there are issues that need to be resolved. “The gaps are closable,” White House national security spokesman John Kirby said. He added, “But it’s going to require, as it always does, some leadership, some compromise.” Harris met with Netanyahu in her ceremonial office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. She is also expected to press him on securing a deal to release the hostages kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack on Israel that launched the war. “We have a lot to talk about,” Harris said as she welcomed the Israeli leader. “We do indeed,” he replied. Thousands protested Netanyahu’s visit in Washington, and Harris condemned those who were violent or used rhetoric that praised Hamas. Netanyahu, last at the White House when former President Donald Trump was in office, is headed to Florida on Friday to meet with the Republican presidential nominee. The conservative Likud Party leader Netanyahu and centrist Democrat Biden have had ups-and-downs over the years. Netanyahu, in what will likely be his last White House meeting with Biden, reflected on the roughly 40 years they’ve known each other and thanked the president for his service. “From a proud Jewish Zionist to a proud Irish American Zionist, I want to thank you for 50 years of public service and 50 years of support for the state of Israel,” Netanyahu told Biden at the start of their meeting. A U.S.-backed proposal to release remaining hostages in Gaza over three phases is something that would be a legacy-affirming achievement for Biden, who abandoned his reelection bid and endorsed Harris. It could also be a boon for Harris in her bid to succeed him. Following their talks, Biden and Netanyahu met with the families of American hostages. For Harris, the meeting with Netanyahu is an opportunity to demonstrate that she has the mettle to serve as commander in chief. She’s being scrutinized by those on the political left who say Biden hasn’t done enough to force Netanyahu to end the conflict and by Republicans looking to brand her as insufficient in her support for Israel. A senior administration official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House, said there is “no daylight between the president and vice president” on Israel. Harris’ last one-on-one engagement with Netanyahu was in March 2021, but she’s taken part in more than 20 calls between Biden and Netanyahu. Netanyahu is trying to navigate his own delicate political moment. He faces pressure from the families of hostages demanding a cease-fire agreement to bring their loved ones home and from far-right members of his governing coalition who demand he resist any deal that could keep Israeli forces from eliminating Hamas. In his speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday, Netanyahu offered a robust defense of Israel’s conduct during its military offensive in Gaza and lashed out against accusations by the International Criminal Court of Israeli war crimes. He made the case that Israel, in its fight against Iran-backed Hamas, was effectively keeping “Americans boots off the ground while protecting our shared interests in the Middle East.” “Remember this: Our enemies are your enemies,” Netanyahu said. “Our fight, it’s your fight. And our victory will be your victory. ” Netanyahu used his speech to praise Biden for his administration’s support in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. But he also noted action that Trump took during his four years in office that benefited Israel, including recognizing Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, confronting Iran’s aggression and moving the U.S Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Netanyahu derided protesters who massed near the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, calling them Iran’s “useful idiots.” Harris on Thursday said she was outraged that some protesters tagged areas near the U.S. Capitol with pro-Hamas graffiti, expressed support for the militants, and burned a U.S. flag at Union Station. “Pro-Hamas graffiti and rhetoric is abhorrent and we must not tolerate it in our nation,” Harris said in a statement. “I condemn the burning of the American flag. That flag is a symbol of our highest ideals as a nation and represents the promise of America. It should never be desecrated in that way.” Protesters massed near the White House on Thursday chanted, “Arrest Netanyahu,” and brought in an effigy of the prime minister with blood on its hands and wearing an orange jumpsuit. A small number of counter-protesters wore Israeli flags around their shoulders. Trump and his Republican allies criticized Harris, who had events in Indiana and Texas on Wednesday, for skipping Netanyahu’s address to Congress. The vice president is the president of the Senate and would typically co-preside over such an event with the House speaker, Republican Mike Johnson. White House officials said that her absence wasn’t a slight and was solely due to scheduling conflicts. Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, also skipped the speech to campaign. Biden, as vice president, skipped an address Netanyahu made to Congress in 2015. Harris has long spoken of her strong support for Israel. The first overseas trip of her Senate career in early 2017 was to Israel, and one of her first acts in office was to introduce a resolution opposing a U.N. Security Council resolution condemning Israel. She’s also spoken of her personal ties to Israel, including memories of raising money as a child to plant trees in Israel, installing a mezuzah near the front door of the vice president’s residence in Washington (her husband is Jewish) and her connections to pro-Israel groups including the conservative American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the liberal J Street. Harris has largely been in lockstep with Biden throughout the conflict, but at moments she’s been a front-runner for tougher Biden administration rhetoric on Israel. She used a high-profile address in March in Selma, Alabama, a day before she met with Netanyahu rival and Israeli war cabinet member Benny Gantz to decry Palestinians “starving” in the face of “inhumane” conditions and to urge Israel to do more to alleviate civilian suffering in Gaza.

And why didn’t she share the details with the American people? That last is the question nearly everyone has, according to a YouGov/Times of London poll of 1,170 registered voters. The July 22 to 23 survey was in the field after President Biden renounced his re-election campaign but before he offered a halting delivery of what was effectively a farewell speech Wednesday night from the Oval Office. A staggering 92% of respondents believe Harris knew at least a little bit about the president’s progressive deterioration, which became too much for even mainstream media to deny after his debate debacle against former President Donald Trump last month in Atlanta, though Biden’s issues have been discussed openly on the right since he took office in 2021. And of that vast majority charging Harris, a former prosecutor, with being part of a conspiracy to defraud the American people about the octogenarian’s obvious decline, most believe she knew a “great deal” about Biden’s issues — but chose not to say anything. Overall, 68% say she had ample knowledge of Biden’s deterioration, with 78% of Republicans, 73% of independents, and 82% of self-identified conservatives believing the VP was central to the coverup. Though more than two of every three voters think Harris essentially had complete knowledge of the president’s deterioration and chose not to divulge it, it’s not as if the rest of the respondents think otherwise. Indeed, an additional 17% of those surveyed believe the VP was “somewhat” involved in the concealment scheme and 7% at least “a little.” The one saving grace for Harris? Only 22% of Democrats, who look poised to nominate her for the presidency without the input of a single voter, think she knew a great deal about Biden’s issues. The left may be reluctant to assign its standard bearer complete culpability, but it doesn’t mean the rest of them are buying into the idea the president’s second in command didn’t have eyes to see what was happening to her boss over the years: 58% of Democrats and 64% of liberals allot her substantial blame at the least, and an additional 20% of Dems and 21% of liberals say she knew at least “a little” about Biden’s health and aging issues. While Dems are more willing to give her the benefit of the doubt, it only goes so far: Only a small number on the left (12% of Democrats and 7% of liberals) believe Harris knew nothing at all about the president’s problems. With Biden expected to stay in office for his term’s remainder, the right has already begun weaponizing voters’ perception of the VP’s deception. Donald Trump’s MAGA Inc. super PAC produced an ad this week that says Harris was in on the coverup, deliberately concealing “Joe’s obvious mental decline.” Expect more of this, especially if Biden continues to flash warning signs of a continued decline.","summary":"And why didn’t she share the details with the American people?","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/92-of-voters-blame-kamala-harris-for-biden-health-coverup-poll/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/07/newspress-collage-61e3ldgne-1721947423286.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1721933068&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Iy2YL9nc-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-25 22:51:25","author":"A.g.

On Thursday, the presumptive Democratic nominee launched her account with a video that’s quickly racking up views and follows. “Madam Vice President, are you on TikTok?” asks a voice off-camera. “Well, I’ve heard recently that I’ve been on the For You Page, so I thought I’d get on here myself,” Harris responds in the clip, which she captioned, “Thought it was about time to join!” Just 30 minutes after joining, Harris already had garnered 100,000 followers on the platform. Harris’ presidential campaign broke the news via People, and her team said that the vice president joining TikTok was her way of breaking “through the noise.” “Our job as a campaign is to break through the noise and make sure we’re talking to voters wherever they are — TikTok is one of those landscapes, and we’re leaving no stone unturned,” deputy campaign manager Rob Flaherty told the outlet. “Getting the vice president up on TikTok means she’ll be able to directly engage with a key constituency in a way that’s true and authentic to the platform and the audience,” he added. Even since before launching her campaign after Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Harris has become a meme-favorite among Gen Z social media users, thanks to videos that play on a 2023 speech where she recounted a story about her mom. The viral quote, which hears her quoting her mother, goes “You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? You exist in the context of all in which you live and what came before you.” Her campaign has also played into Charli XCX’s Brat summer by changing their X header to the chartreuse aesthetic of the British singer’s album.","summary":"\"She’ll be able to directly engage with a key constituency in a way that’s true and authentic to the platform and the audience,\" said Harris' deputy campaign manager","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/kamala-harris-joins-tiktok-1235068394/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2162559863-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-25 22:51:09","author":"Tomás Mier","authors":["Tomás Mier"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.277},{"id":252642026,"title":"‘The View’s’ Ana Navarro Uses Nude Melania Trump Photo to Defend Kamala Harris","text":"Ana Navarro, a long-time co-host of The View, posted on her Instagram Thursday an old photo of nude Melania Trump.

Don’t tell me the American Dream is dead. Sure, Harris is a demagogue who speaks in cringy, swirling, impenetrable platitudes. But let’s discuss her record and stated positions. It seems like a lifetime ago that President Biden named Harris his running mate. What you may not recall is that the media tried to gaslight us into believing the California senator was another apolitical dealmaker. Former Clinton fixer George Stephanopoulos said Harris was “the middle-of-the-road, moderate wing of the Democratic Party.” The New York Times called her a “pragmatic moderate,” while the Associated Press focused on her “centrist record.” And so on. A “small c conservative,” one Washington Post columnist wrote. The only problem was, according to GovTrack, Harris’ record in the Senate was to the left of red-diaper baby Bernie Sanders. She was least likely of any senator to join in any bipartisan bills. Harris wasn’t handed a Senate seat by the California political hierarchy to waste her time legislating with a bunch of pinheads. She was there to run for the presidency. In her truncated first term, few excelled more at smearing their political opponents. Remember when Harris “moderately” accused Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh of gang rape? This false perception of moderation stems from Harris’ time as prosecutor and AG. Harris liked to brag about using “a huge stick” as a prosecutor in San Francisco, where she regularly threatened poor parents with jail time in her efforts to craft social policy — which wasn’t her job. It’s true that Harris threw a lot of people in jail to bolster her political fortunes. Some of them likely innocent. And judging from her disposition, she would throw a lot of more people into jail, if she could. When pro-life journalist David Daleiden published videos of Planned Parenthood executives nonchalantly discussing the selling of body parts, Harris had his home raided, seized evidence and then tried to throw him in prison. She later teamed up with the abortion mill to write legislation that would squash the free speech rights of other pro-lifers. Like any good authoritarian, Harris enforces whatever laws she sees fit to enforce whenever she sees fit. One of the reasons Kamala allegedly opposed the nomination of Neil Gorsuch was that the judge “consistently valued legalisms” — which is to say, respected the Constitution — “over real lives.” Kamala was never one for legalism. When candidate Biden argued that Harris’ promise to issue an executive order unilaterally banning access to certain guns would be unconstitutional, she retorted: “I would just say: Hey, Joe, instead of saying ‘No we can’t,’ let’s say yes, we can,’” before cackling at the very notion that presidents couldn’t do whatever they wanted. As a national candidate, Kamala said she believed immigration laws should be treated as civil, rather than criminal, offenses. She supported abolishing private health insurance — “Let’s eliminate all of that. Let’s move on,” she told CNN. In addition to nationalizing health care and education, Kamala wants the government to control the manufacturing sector, the auto industry, food . . . and any industry that emits carbon. Harris was in favor of getting rid of the filibuster to overturn state voting laws, nationalizing abortion on demand until birth and passing the Green New Deal — an authoritarian takeover of the economy written by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, which would ban all fossil fuels, force Americans to retrofit every building in in the country, eliminate air travel and meat and create government-guaranteed jobs, among many other authoritarian measures. On foreign policy, we don’t really know, though we can guess. This week, Harris wouldn’t even attend when Benjamin Netanyahu, the prime minister of the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, delivered a speech to Congress. A few weeks ago, the same Kamala said antisemitic pro-Hamas campus protesters showed “exactly what the human emotion should be.” In the past she has openly protested with Islamic Republic propagandists from the National Iranian American Council. To be fair, in some ways her disposition comports more with the latter than the former. When I say Harris is an authoritarian, I’m not contending she’s Hitler. I am saying she is a fan of obedience to authority, especially of Democrat-run government, at the expense of personal freedom in ways that are deeply un-American. That’s a bad trend in politics in general, but it’s difficult to think of many politicians more wedded to the idea than Kamala Harris. David Harsanyi is a senior editor at the Federalist.

On Wednesday, the Russians did come — intentionally — just ahead of President Biden’s Oval Office speech explaining why he abruptly stepped down from his re-election campaign against former President Donald Trump. And the Russians brought Chinese bombers along with them for good measure. Shortly before Biden’s evening address to the nation, NORAD reported that US and Canadian fighter jets had “intercepted two Russian TU-95 and two PRC H-6 military aircraft operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone.” Message received, loud and clear: Beijing and Moscow are signaling they believe no one is fully in charge at the White House. Russia and China are sensing a vacuum at the West Wing as power begins to transition from Biden to Vice President Kamala Harris, now said to be essentially acting as a co-president in all but name. Biden’s stilted exit speech only reinforced that notion. And given that the country’s national-security interests in Europe, Africa, the Middle East and the Indo-Pacific are increasingly under kinetic attack, a rudderless White House is not a good thing. In failing to explain why he couldn’t beat Trump in a rematch, Biden also failed to stand down Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping. Instead, they are likely preparing to take advantage of Biden’s Democratic Party-imposed lame-duck status. Wednesday was emblematic of the strategic openings Biden and Harris are presenting to Moscow and Beijing (as well as their Axis of Evil allies), as they essentially went AWOL in Washington. Biden set the tone by postponing his meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu — and Harris followed on by electing not to preside over Bibi’s joint address to Congress. Both were the wrong messages to send to Russia and China — and exactly the wrong kind of strategic greenlighting that it effectively sent to Hamas, Hezbollah and their Iranian sponsors as they wage a widening war against Israel. Netanyahu’s address to Congress was his first public speech to American lawmakers since Oct. 7. Forty-five Americans were killed in that terrorist attack. Eight US citizens are still being held hostage by Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The Israeli leader even brought American family members of the hostages to the House chamber. Harris’ excuse? She chose not to stand with Israel at the joint session because she opted to make a campaign address at a Zeta Phi Beta sorority gathering. But that was just an excuse to get out of Dodge and curry electoral favor with the progressive wing of the Democratic Party — at the direct expense of America’s closest ally in the Middle East. Hamas’ useful idiots in Washington, DC, got the message as well. During Netanyahu’s address, they assaulted Capitol Police officers, vandalized monuments and federal buildings, burned American flags at Union Station and defaced a replica Liberty Bell with anti-Israel and antisemitic graffiti — all on Biden and Harris’ watch. Is this really what defending democracy looks like? Biden and Harris chose to essentially abandon Washington, leaving it to the pro-Palestinian mob — and in so doing gave an open invitation to our nation’s enemies to trample on US national-security interests in the Mideast and elsewhere. November politics are endangering Americans, our troops and our allies, while Iran is waging a multi-pronged war against Israel and aggressively working to weaponize its nuclear program. This cannot continue: Moscow, Beijing, Tehran and Pyongyang will not be deterred unless they know someone is in control at the White House. At present, that isn’t clear. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and national security adviser Jake Sullivan are gone if Harris wins, according to reports — with Phillip Gordon, the veep’s current national-security chief and a former Obama administration official who helped negotiate the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, widely expected take the leading role. Since Austin and Sullivan are likely lame ducks, are they already ceding policy decisions to Harris and Gordon? Or is Biden nominally still in charge? Likely not. Strategic ambiguity has its value — up to a point. We perilously crossed that threshold on Wednesday when Russian and Chinese bombers told us in Alaska that they were seeing through it. Moscow and Beijing are likely betting no one is really holding the reins at Biden’s unraveling White House — and that’s a dangerous place to be.

Harris frequently made headlines serving as what many called Biden's \"border czar,\" trying to quell chaos at America’s border with Mexico. Now that she has become the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee, Republicans have shifted their focus from Biden to call out her lack of success in that role, a role that personalities at CNN, MSNBC and Axios have begun claiming she never served. On a Thursday broadcast of \"CNN News Central,\" CNN reporter Alayna Treene spoke about how the Trump campaign has had to switch tactics after President Biden stepped down and endorsed Harris. \"They have had an entire playbook built and designed around going after an unpopular 81-year-old. And so now they’re trying to figure out exactly the best ways to define Kamala Harris and to attack her,\" later noting the focuses would be on immigration, the border, inflation, and crime. CNN reporter Daniel Dale responded to clips of Trump’s recent rally, arguing that there were multiple false claims, one of which was that Harris had been put in charge of the border.

She wasn‘t. She was never put in charge of the border. She was given a much more limited assignment to lead a so-called root causes diplomatic effort trying to address the reasons in Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras that people choose to migrate.\" The reporter then added that \"many Republicans scoff at this kind of fact-check, they’re like ‘There were a bunch of articles back in 2021, they called her ‘border czar.' Frankly, those articles were wrong,\" he said. \"And if you look at CNN‘s own covers, not to toot our own horn, but you‘ll see that the White House and Harris‘s office consistently as early ‘21, pushed back on that framing.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE Biden had said in a March 24, 2021 video that Harris was \"leading the effort to coordinate with Mexico and other Northern Triangle nations to address issues such as the surge of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border.\" There has been a fiery debate over the past week over whether outlets are trying to cover for Harris by denying that she was in charge of securing the border.
