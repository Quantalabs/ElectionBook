Life had other plans!\n\nREAD MORE: Hulk Hogan dead at 71: WWE icon passes away in Florida\n\nBy CHRISTOPHER STEVENS\n\nPublished: 00:41 BST, 25 July 2025 | Updated: 01:58 BST, 25 July 2025\n\nDonald Trump revered him. 'How about the Hulkster, how good was he?' the President demanded to a cheering rally crowd last year.\n\nTerry Bollea, alias Hulk Hogan, stood to acknowledge the praise. 'I know about entertainment,' bragged Trump, 'but when he used to lift a 350lb man over his shoulders and bench-press him two rows into the audience – there aren't a lot of entertainers that can do that, right? He is one strong son-of-a-gun.'\n\nFormer wrestling superstar Hogan, who died yesterday at his home in Florida from cardiac arrest, aged 71, campaigned hard to earn Trump a second term in the White House. Often hinting he had ambitions for a career in politics himself – as the President's fitness tsar, perhaps.\n\nHe could certainly match Trump for outrageous political statements. While promoting his own brand of 'Real American' beer during last year's presidential election campaign, he asked a raucous crowd in Ohio if they wanted to see him 'body slam Kamala Harris', the Democratic nominee.\n\nBut it was for his decades in the US wrestling scene that he was internationally famous, once boasting, 'In Mozambique and Malaysia, they know Hulk Hogan – the parents, the grandparents and the kids. It's amazing how many homes I have been into around the world on a consistent basis for 40-plus years'.\n\nBursting out of his trademark leotards, and with a swathe of bandana knotted across his bulging, bald forehead, he was instantly recognisable.\n\nTo a European audience, his massive chest and peroxide horseshoe moustache made him look like a modern-day Obelix the Gaul, as though he'd fallen into a cauldron of magic potion as a baby.\n\nTo American fans, with his reputed 6ft7 physique and arms like an Olympic cyclist's legs, he seemed to be a rubber action figure brought to life.\n\nHulk Hogan gesturing to the audience during his Hulkamania Tour at the Burswood Dome on November 24, 2009 in Perth, Australia\n\nMore recently, Hogan became a celebrity endorser for Trump's presidential campaign in the United States, which he went on to win\n\nHe won six championships with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), counted Andy Warhol among his celebrity fans, and held the record for drawing the spectacle's largest TV audience, 33million viewers – still the most-watched wrestling match in American television history – tuning in to see him fight 7ft4 Andre the Giant in 1988.\n\nWWE was not so much a sport, more a violence-fuelled soap opera, and Hogan understood the largest ego would dominate its storylines.\n\nAt first he played the all-American hero, taking on a succession of wrestler villains in protracted feuds. When the public began to tire of that, he reinvented himself as the king of the villains, Hollywood Hulk Hogan, leader of the New World Order.\n\nHis movies, including Mr Nanny and Suburban Commando, were commercial failures, though he also appeared in Rocky III with Sylvester Stallone.\n\nDespite announcing he was retiring on several occasions, he remained a beloved figure on the wrestling scene until 2015, when online celebrity gossip site Gawker released a video of Hogan – who was married to his second wife, Jennifer, at the time – having sex with a woman, with her husband's encouragement.\n\nHogan sued Gawker for invading his privacy and won, settling for $31million (£23million). Gawker, run by a former Financial Times journalist named Nick Denton, went bankrupt.\n\nBut during the trial, an audio recording was played of Hogan unleashing a racist diatribe at the idea of his daughter Brooke sleeping with a black man. Repeatedly using the 'N-word', he declared: 'I am a racist, to a point.'\n\nIn the 1980s, Hogan was the driving force behind WWE's rise from a regional promotion around New York to an international brand - pictured 1991 - but saw his legacy tainted by a racism scandal in 2015\n\nHis wife Sky(pictured with Hogan during the Jake Paul vs Mike Perry in July 2024) previously claimed his heart was 'strong' after he underwent a routine neck surgery \n\nThe WWE icon passed away early Thursday morning after medics were dispatched to his Clearwater, Florida home, per TMZ - pictured \n\nThe star is pictured with daughter Brooke, second ex wife Linda and son Nick in 2005\n\nHogan is pictured at Trump's campaign rally in NYC in October 2024\n\nHe was suspended from the WWE, but then reinstated in 2018.\n\nBorn in Augusta, Georgia, in 1953, his mother Ruth was a dance teacher and his father Peter a construction worker. His parents wanted him to be an accountant, and it wasn't\n\nuntil they saw him fight at Madison Square Garden in 1984 that his father admitted that wrestling could be a worthy career. 'That was the greatest night for me,' Hogan said.\n\nIn recent years, he claimed to have stopped drinking and abusing prescription drugs, and found God – calling himself, 'a meat suit filled with the spirit of Christ'. He leaves two children, his daughter and a son, Nick, as well as his third wife, Sky.\n\nHulk Hogan, he said, was always just a persona, a character he played. 'The moment I walk out the front door, the world doesn't want Terry. They say, 'Hey Hulk!' So I say, 'Hey brother, how are you doing!' They expect it.\n\n'But the moment I come home, the headband comes off the bald head, and it's just Terry, dad, father, husband and friend. It's not just a job, but I have learned to separate myself.'\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nCHRISTOPHER STEVENS: His real name was Terry and his parents hoped he would be an accountant.

Walz, the governor of Minnesota and one-time running mate of former Vice President Kamala Harris, is threatening to pull out of the bipartisan National Governors Association (NGA) over concerns it is not doing enough to push back against Trump, according to The Atlantic. The Atlantic reported that two unnamed people \"familiar with the governors' thinking\" shared that at least two Democratic governors — Walz and fellow Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly, who is head of the Democratic Governors Association — are opting to stop paying their NGA dues this month. The two governors will not renew their membership in the organization out of frustration with its inaction against perceived violations of states’ rights by the Trump administration. TRUMP FOE BOASBERG ORDERS DOJ TO DETAIL STATUS OF CECOT MIGRANTS SENT TO VENEZUELA The concerns raised included the Office of Management and Budget briefly pausing disbursements of federal funds in January, the clash with Democratic Gov. Janet Mills over transgender athletes and Trump’s deployment of the California National Guard to respond to the anti-ICE riots in Los Angeles. The outlet reported three other unnamed sources saying that Walz and Kelly are not alone and that the offices of other Democratic governors are similarly frustrated with the NGA. One of the unnamed sources said \"when you are also paying dues with taxpayer dollars, it has got to be worth it, and they are going to have to demonstrate that. Right now, they are not doing that,\" the outlet reported. The source also claimed \"there have been ongoing concerns about the NGA among the Democratic governors and staff, off and on, for years.\" MESSAGING WAR OVER TRUMP'S 'BIG BEAUTIFUL BILL' HEATS UP BETWEEN DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS The NGA has existed as a forum for bipartisan collaboration among governors since 1908. The organization lists all 50 governors as well as leaders of five U.S. territories as members. Eric Wohlschlegel, NGA communications director, told Fox News Digital the group \"exists to bring governors from both parties together around shared priorities.\" Amid the Walz-led controversy, Wohlschlegel said NGA’s \"mission hasn’t changed.\" \"Every public statement NGA issues reflects bipartisan consensus,\" he said. \"So far this year, all but one statement has had that consensus, and when governors don’t agree, we simply don’t issue one. That’s how we preserve our role as a bipartisan convener, a principle we won’t compromise.\" DNC CHAIR SAYS 'WE WANT EVERYONE' IN DEMOCRATIC PARTY INCLUDING 'LEFTISTS' LIKE MAMDANI A source familiar with the situation blamed the controversy on \"Democratic infighting, unspoken campaign jockeying and a few anonymous voices looking to reshape a nonpartisan institution into a political one.\" That source pointed out that, despite all the noise about controversy, the NGA’s summer meeting in Colorado Springs this weekend is expected to have \"record turnout\" with 13 Republican and seven Democratic leaders attending. They also noted that \"no governors are on the record expressing discontent with the NGA. No allegations of misconduct, governance failure or mismanagement have been raised.\" \"What’s behind the noise?\" the source added. \"There’s an internal power struggle currently and no consensus among Democrats right now on how to lead, how to message or how to govern in a divided environment. \"Several Democratic governors are vying for national attention, testing messages for future campaigns rather than collaborating on consensus governance,\" the source added. \"The NGA’s bipartisan model is working exactly as it’s supposed to. DEMOCRATIC PARTY'S AUTOPSY REPORT OF 2024 ELECTION WILL AVOID ASKING IF HARRIS SHOULD HAVE RUN \"When a party can’t agree with itself, it becomes easy to take shots at bipartisan institutions that don’t serve short-term political goals.\" Fox News Digital reached out to the offices of Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis, the outgoing NGA chair, and Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma, the incoming chair, for comment on the Walz mutiny. Though not addressing the controversy directly, Conor Cahill, a spokesperson for Polis, told Fox News Digital the governor \"has been honored\" to lead the NGA and to \"work across the aisle with governors on education, permitting reform, standing up to federal efforts to strip away gubernatorial authority around the National Guard and elevating the priorities of states.\" He added that \"during this polarizing time, bipartisan organizations are needed more than ever, and NGA must continue to demonstrate value to all governors and effectively communicate governors' opinions on various matters with the public and the federal government.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Abegail Cave, a spokesperson for Sitt, who will become NGA chair this weekend, told Fox News Digital \"people seem to forget NGA is a bipartisan organization, not a political one.\" \"Coming to bipartisan consensus is difficult, but governors from across the political spectrum are addressing the real challenges facing Americans every day,\" Cave said. She said that Stitt \"looks forward to leading this organization and finding more areas of collaboration in the coming year.\" Fox News Digital also reached out to the offices of Walz and Kelly but did not receive responses by the time of publication.","summary":"Dem Gov.

Hulk Hogan).\n\nThe legendary WWE wrestler Hulk Hogan died aged 71 years on Thursday morning in Florida, USA.\n\nTrump wrote on Truth Social: “We lost a great friend today, the ‘Hulkster’.\n\n“Hulk Hogan was MAGA all the way — Strong, tough, smart, but with the biggest heart,” wrote the American President in tribute to the late pro wrestling star.\n\nWhile Hogan endorsed Barack Obama in 2008, his allegiance shifted to Republicans in recent years.\n\nIn his post, Trump referred to the Hulk Hogan’s famed speech at the RNC.\n\n“He gave an absolutely electric speech at the Republican National Convention, that was one of the highlights of the entire week,” Trump wrote further. “He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive. To his wife, Sky, and family, we give our warmest best wishes and love. Hulk Hogan will be greatly missed!” Concludes Trump.\n\nSimilarly, American Vice President, JD Vance, remembered Bollea as a “great American icon.”\n\n“One of the first people I ever truly admired as a kid,” Vance wrote on X. “The last time I saw him we promised we’d get beers together next time we saw each other. The next time will have to be on the other side, my friend! Rest in peace.”\n\nIn the official statement released by Hulk Hogan’s Family on Instagram, it \n\nannounced the death and requested for his privacy to be respected at this moment.\n\n“It is with a heavy heart and deep sadness that we confirm we have lost a legend,” a post on Hulk Hogan’s official Instagram account says.\n\nHogan passed away “surrounded by his loved ones,” it reads.\n\n“At this time of grief, we ask that everyone please respect the privacy of his family and friends.” He will be missed “but never forgotten”, it adds.\n\nHulk Hogan will be remembered for his wrestling stardom, but also for many, they will remember the various controversies surrounding him.\n\nIn 1994, he testified in the case of Vince McMahon, WWE co-founder, after getting immunity from prosecution. The infamous case saw prosecutors accuse McMahon and WWE of providing illegal steroids to wrestlers.\n\nHogan’s testimony was key in the government losing the case – success for McMahon. But it was seen by some as a betrayal that Hogan even testified against McMahon.\n\nAs was reported earlier, Hogan was removed from the WWE Hall of Fame in 2015 over a racist slur he was caught saying on tape. He was reinstated three years later.\n\nIn 2024, he took aim at the then vice-President Kamala Harris: “Do you want me to body slam Kamala Harris?” while speaking at an event for his new beer.\n\nA one-off appearance at the start of 2025 saw him receive a deafening amount of boos from the crowd, not the entrance expected for one of the greats of WWE.\n\nHulk Hogan was instrumental in wrestling’s 1980s “golden era.” Hogan’s popularity and his rivalries with “Rowdy” Roddy Piper, André Rene Roussimoff – known as André the Giant, “Macho Man” Randy Savage and scores of others made professional wrestling a multi-billion-dollar industry in the 1980s and early 1990s.","summary":"President of the United States of America, Donald Trump, has expressed sadness at the death of WWE Pro Wrestler, Terry Bollea, (a.k.a.

Skydance agreed to employ an ombudsman for at least two years, “who will receive and evaluate any complaints of bias or other concerns involving CBS.” \n“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,” Republican FCC Chair Brendan Carr said in a statement announcing the agency’s approval. “That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.” He said the commitments “would enable CBS to operate in the public interest and focus on fair, unbiased, and fact-based coverage,” and mark “another step forward in the FCC’s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination.” Carr also boasts that Skydance “reaffirms its commitment to localism as a core component of the public interest standard,” and that the approval will “unleash the investment of $1.5 billion into Paramount.”\nCarr has made no secret of his distaste for news coverage he sees as disproportionately unfavorable to the right and DEI policies he believes contribute to unfair treatment. He’s opened investigations into all three major networks as well as NPR and PBS (NBCUniversal and its owner Comcast are investors in The Verge parent company Vox Media). A week ago, CBS announced it was retiring The Late Show, hosted by Trump critic and comedian Stephen Colbert. The network said it was “purely a financial decision.”\nThe FCC’s only remaining Democratic commissioner, Anna Gomez, dissented, writing that, “In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom … Even more alarming, it is now imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.” Still, she gave Carr credit for calling a vote on the matter, rather than rubber-stamping the merger through one of the agency’s bureaus, like it did for the Verizon-Frontier merger, which similarly required an end to DEI programs.\nGomez warns that this agreement is just the canary in the coal mine. “The Paramount payout and this reckless approval have emboldened those who believe the government can—and should—abuse its power to extract financial and ideological concessions, demand favored treatment, and secure positive media coverage,” she writes. “It is a dark chapter in a long and growing record of abuse that threatens press freedom in this country. But such violations endure only when institutions choose capitulation over courage. It is time for companies, journalists, and citizens alike to stand up and speak out, because unchecked and unquestioned power has no rightful place in America.”","summary":"The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has approved Skydance’s $8 billion purchase of CBS-owner Paramount after the companies agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs but feature a “diversity of viewpoints from across the political and ideological spectrum.” In light of the Trump administration’s critiques of CBS’s alleged anti-conservative bias — including collecting a [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.theverge.com/news/713587/paramount-skydance-merger-approved-fcc-speech-dei-bias","image":"https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/STKP211_BRENDAN_CARR_A.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0,10.732984293194,100,78.534031413613","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:57:14","author":"Lauren Feiner","authors":["Lauren Feiner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.084},{"id":344980968,"title":"FCC Approves Paramount’s $8 Billion Merger with Skydance Entertainment Group","text":"The Trump administration’s regulators have given the green light to Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, marking a significant alteration in the ownership of one of America’s leading networks.\n\nOn Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission announced its approval of the acquisition. FCC Chairman Brendan Carr noted in a press release that this development would introduce changes to the network’s news coverage. Paramount, which owns CBS, encompasses CBS News.\n\n“Americans have lost trust in the traditional national news media to report comprehensively, accurately, and impartially. A change is necessary,” said Carr. “This is why I support Skydance’s vow to implement major revisions at the once-renowned CBS broadcast network. Notably, Skydance has provided written assurances that the revived company’s programming will reflect a variety of perspectives, covering the entire political and ideological landscape.”\n\n“Today’s decision also marks another step forward in the FCC’s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI discrimination,” Carr added. \n\nIn recent days, Paramount’s new owner made a number of concessions to the FCC, including agreeing to not implement any diversity, equity or inclusion programs. Skydance also said it would “undertake a comprehensive review” of CBS and “will commit, for a period of at least two years, to have in place an ombudsman.” That role would report to the president of the new company. \n\nA number of companies that have billion-dollar transactions pending before Carr’s FCC have also backed off of DEI programs, including Verizon and T-Mobile. \n\nThe concessions also came after Paramount Global settled a lawsuit with President Donald Trump for $16 million. Trump brought that suit, saying the way CBS edited a “60 Minutes” interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris was “election and voter interference.” \n\nThe lone Democrat in FCC leadership, Commissioner Anna Gomez, did not mince words about the push to secure promises from the companies.\n\n“After months of cowardly capitulation to this ministration, Paramount finally got what it wanted,” she said in an emailed statement. \n\n“In an unprecedented move, this once-independent FCC used its vast power to pressure Paramount to broker a private legal settlement and further erode press freedom,” she added. “Once again, this agency is undermining legitimate efforts to combat discrimination and expand opportunity by overstepping its authority and intervening in employment matters reserved for other government entities with proper jurisdiction on these issues.”\n\n“Even more alarming, it is now imposing never-before-seen controls over newsroom decisions and editorial judgment, in direct violation of the First Amendment and the law.”\n\nSkydance is run by David Ellison, son of Oracle founder and Trump ally Larry Ellison. While the younger Ellison made a donation to President Joe Biden’s re-election fund in February 2024 shortly before the former president bowed out of the race, Trump recently signaled his comfort with his takeover of Paramount and its assets, which in addition to CBS News include Nickelodeon, Comedy Central, The CW, MTV, BET and film franchises like “Smurfs” and “Sonic the Hedgehog.”\n\n“Ellison is great. He’ll do a great job with it,” Trump said in June.\n\nThere is likely to be a sea change in the editorial direction of CBS News under its new ownership. In a recent filing, Ellison and Skydance said they’d told Carr that they were committed to pursuing a focus on “American storytelling” while touting a new, “unbiased” editorial direction for CBS News. Their meeting came shortly after Paramount agreed to settle Trump’s lawsuit. \n\nIt also came just days after CBS announced it was canceling “The Late Show,” currently hosted by Stephen Colbert — an announcement Trump praised on social media. Colbert had recently criticized the parent company’s multimillion-dollar settlement with Trump, while CBS said the cancellation was “purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.”\n\nThere had been signs of an editorial shift ahead of the merger. Most notably, longtime “60 Minutes” editor Bill Owens announced he was stepping down this spring, citing CBS News’ fading editorial independence. Shortly after, CBS News President and CEO Wendy McMahon was pushed out. Last week, The New York Times reported Skydance was in early talks to acquire the conservative-leaning The Free Press media outlet. Meanwhile, “Daily Show” host Jon Stewart has said he did not know whether his program would survive the merger. \n\nSkydance has spent years pursuing Paramount and eventually realized it could successfully execute the transaction by purchasing Paramount’s parent, National Amusements, the company once helmed by Sumner Redstone, the father of the company’s current chairwoman, president and CEO, Shari Redstone. Yet the proposed deal continued to face hurdles, first under the Biden administration then at the outset of Trump’s term. Its approval came in what was its third deadline extension period.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe Trump administration&#8217;s regulators have given the green light to Skydance Media&#8217;s&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: FCC Approves Paramount&#8217;s $8 Billion Merger with Skydance Entertainment Group first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/fcc-approves-paramounts-8-billion-merger-with-skydance-entertainment-group/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FCC-greenlights-Paramount039s-8-billion-merger-with-entertainment-group-Skydance.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:50:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.103},{"id":344991310,"title":"The 2028 Presidential Race Has Begun","text":"Rahm Emanuel, the former Chicago mayor and adviser to two Democratic presidents, is suddenly all over the news. This week alone, he’s appeared on a number of podcasts in what seem to be early forays into an exploratory campaign for president. Emanuel went on the former Fox News host Megyn Kelly’s podcast and answered “no” when asked if a man can “become a woman.” On another podcast, with The Free Press’s Bari Weiss, Emanuel said that Democrats lost in 2024 because Kamala Harris didn’t set herself apart from Joe Biden, and noted that his party “got sidetracked” by issues that were not front of mind for voters.\n\nEmanuel was the most visible in the media this week, but he’s not the only would-be candidate we’re hearing from. This morning, former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg went on the podcast The Breakfast Club; he also made a surprise cameo on a Barstool Sports podcast last week to present a jokey “Lib of the Year” award to the internet personality Jersey Jerry, who was wearing a MAGA hat. In an elegant Vogue spread, an old-school and somewhat stiff way to communicate one’s political ambitions, Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear bragged about having once been on MrBeast’s show. “We’ve got to do the YouTube shows,” he said, telling the reporter that, unlike Harris, he would have gone on The Joe Rogan Experience. Buttigieg and Representative Ro Khanna of California have both appeared on the comedy podcast Flagrant, co-hosted by Andew Schulz. California Governor Gavin Newsom invited the conservative activist Charlie Kirk to be a guest on the first episode of his podcast.\n\nThese appearances indicate that Democrats “are finally waking up to the fact that you can’t run a presidential campaign” simply “by going on CNN and MSNBC,” Lis Smith, a Democratic strategist who worked on Buttigieg’s 2020 presidential campaign, told me. And these public appearances aren’t just a way for presidential hopefuls to introduce themselves to voters; they’re also opportunities for donors and party elites to start eyeballing their favorites and winnowing the primary field.\n\nMost party strategists I’ve spoken with this year believe that Democrats need to appear on more nontraditional and ideologically diverse outlets to reach new voters and make more people—even those who don’t agree with the Democrats on everything—feel welcome inside the party tent. Donald Trump’s successful turns on Rogan’s podcast and on shows hosted by the comedians Theo Von and Schulz contributed to his victory last November.\n\nDemocratic hopefuls everywhere are swearing more and attempting to adopt a little more swagger. In his interview with Weiss, Emanuel, who once sent a dead fish to a political enemy, leaned back in his chair, looking unbothered; Buttigieg chopped it up with the bros on Flagrant for more than two hours. Notably, some female potential candidates aren’t yet in the mix—where’s Gretchen Whitmer these days? Lanae Erickson, a senior vice president at the center-left think tank Third Way, told me that she didn’t know, but that it’s clear the party’s decline in support from men “has really lit a fire under Democratic dudes.”\n\nAlong with a broader shift in media strategy, we’re also seeing a shift in rhetoric from at least some Democrats. “These folks are right that the Democratic Party was seen as too extreme, and that contributed to our loss,” Erickson told me. She’s pleased, she said, that the current zeitgeist seems to be a move “toward the middle.” The Democratic course correction has begun.\n\nPart of that involves punching left. After Emanuel told Kelly that a man cannot become a woman, Kelly sighed, lamenting, “Why don’t more people in your party just say that?” “Because,” Emanuel joked, “I’m now going to go into a witness-protection plan.” Newsom told Kirk that allowing transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports is “deeply unfair,” and had broader critiques of the Democratic Party’s communication skills.\n\nDemocrats on the campaign trail have had a difficult time addressing topics around gender. One analysis conducted by a Democratic super PAC found that a Republican ad about Harris’s views on transgender identity was effective for Trump during the 2024 campaign. (Many Democrats criticized Harris’s campaign for refusing to respond to the ad, whose tagline read: “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you.”) Emanuel’s answer on Kelly’s show, whether or not it’s a winning message with the Democratic base, speaks to a tone change on the topic. Every 2028 hopeful can expect to be asked directly about their views on the subject—and “should be ready to answer,” Smith told me.\n\nEven by the standards of the previous cycle’s incredibly early campaigning, all of this might seem rather premature to discuss. But as Emanuel himself is famous for saying, a good crisis should never go to waste. Democratic presidential hopefuls are well aware that the party’s leadership vacuum is an opportunity—and they’re determined to not misuse it.\n\nHere are three new stories from The Atlantic:\n\nToday’s News\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nMore From The Atlantic\n\nEvening Read\n\nThe Problem With Rewards Credit Cards\n\nBy Ellen Cushing\n\nCulture Break\n\nWatch.

Carr was hand-picked by Donald Trump to lead the FCC.\n\nParamount Global, which owns CBS, came under fire last week after the company decided to cancel The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, just a few days after its host criticized Paramount’ for settling with Trump. Colbert called the settlement “a big, fat bribe”.\n\nIn response to news of the merger on Thursday, Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren, who has called for an investigation into Paramount’s relationship with Trump over the Skydance merger, wrote in a social media post: “Sure looks like they paid Donald Trump $36 MILLION for this merger. Bribery is illegal no matter who is president.”\n\nSkydance is owned by David Ellison, the son of a close Trump ally, tech billionaire and second richest man in the world Larry Ellison.\n\nThe merger came after Skydance and its investment partner, RedBird Capital, assured the FCC of their commitment to unbiased journalism that represents diverse viewpoints.\n\nBut that committment to diversity appears to privilege conservative viewpoints. According to Carr, Skydance “has made written commitments” promising its news network will address conservative grievances and stop all efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nSkydance said it would appoint an ombudsman to evaluate complaints of editorial bias or other concerns about CBS in an effort to promote transparency and increased accountability.\n\n“Approving this transaction will unleash the investment of $1.5 billion into Paramount, bolstering all aspects of its operations, including broadcast”, Carr added in his statement.\n\nThat is precisely the same amount Paramount agreed to pay the creators of South Park earlier this week for global streaming rights over the next five years.\n\nThe first episode of the satirical animated series, broadcast on Wednesday and now streaming on the Paramount+ app, mocked Trump as a whiny, would-be autocrat with small genitalia in bed with Satan. It also featured thinly veiled criticism of the company for settling with Trump and canceling Colbert’s show.\n\nThe new South Park episode ended by ridiculing reports that its new owners had agreed to give Trump $20m in public service announcements and advertising for free. The episode concluded with a mock public service announcement, ostensibly in favor of Trump, that pictured him naked with a miniature, talking penis. “Trump, his penis is teeny-tiny”, a narrator intones, “but his love for us is large”.","summary":"FCC approval of deal comes after Paramount paid $16m to settle Trump lawsuit over 60 Minutes interview\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission approved the merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media on Thursday, clearing the way for an $8.4bn sale of some of the most prominent names in entertainment, including the CBS broadcast television network, Paramount Pictures, and the Nickelodeon cable channel.\n\nThe FCC agreed to transfer broadcast licenses for 28 owned-and-operated CBS television stations to the new owners after Paramount paid $16m to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over a 60 Minutes interview with former vice-president Kamala Harris that aired in October.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/24/paramount-skydance-merger-fcc","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c55063bdf672c9d7e09a97699b11d8e4a528ed9/401_0_4210_3368/master/4210.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 23:14:29","author":"Cecilia Nowell","authors":["Cecilia Nowell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.084},{"id":344982240,"title":"Paramount Has a $1.5 Billion ‘South Park’ Problem","text":"We found out what more they could say yesterday, in brutal fashion. The same day Paramount announced a five-year streaming deal with South Park, including 50 new episodes, the show’s 27th season premiere mercilessly mocked both President Trump and the network for capitulating to his demands, settling with him over the 60 Minutes lawsuit, and canceling The Late Show With Stephen Colbert. The episode, called “Sermon on the ’Mount,” did not hold back on crass jokes aimed at Trump, showing him with a “teeny tiny” penis both in animation and as a deepfake and portraying him as Satan’s lover in a style reminiscent of the gay Saddam Hussein character from the 1999 movie South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut.\nThe episode aired as Paramount is set to merge with media company Skydance. Politicians and media personalities alike are speculating that the company’s eagerness to keep Trump happy is motivated by gaining the US Federal Communications Commission’s approval of the deal, which was made official Thursday evening. Before being fired, Colbert, a late-night ratings leader, described Paramount’s $16-million settlement with Trump as a “big fat bribe” and on Monday’s show he said “the gloves are off” while telling the president “go fuck yourself.” Between Colbert’s remaining season, network colleague Jon Stewart’s scathing indictment of both Paramount and CBS, the new South Park deal, and a transformative merger, the company appears to be looking at a period where some of its biggest stars are openly hostile to both it and the president.\n“I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network,” FCC chairman Brendan Carr—who wrote Project 2025’s chapter on the telecommunications agency—reportedly said in a statement Thursday supporting the merger. “Today’s decision also marks another step forward in the FCC’s efforts to eliminate invidious forms of DEI.”\nParamount did not respond to WIRED’s requests for comment. In a statement emailed to WIRED, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers derided South Park as irrelevant and derided “left” fans who liked the season opener.\n“The Left’s hypocrisy truly has no end—for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as ‘offense’ [sic] content, but suddenly they are praising the show. Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows,” she wrote.\n“This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history—and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak.”\nParamount’s press release announcing the South Park deal—reported to be worth $1.5 billion—describes the show as “one of the most valuable TV franchises in the world.” It also praises Parker and Stone as “fearless” and “boundary-pushing.”\nBut the roasting of Trump in “Sermon on the ’Mount” was also something else: mean. Deeply, devastatingly mean.\nAfter being accused by the Canadian prime minister of being akin to a “dictator from the Middle East,” Trump lashes out at a White House artist for painting him with a small penis. The small dick theme is repeated throughout the episode, with numerous portraits of him humping things and animals and Satan telling him, “I can’t even see anything, it’s so small.” Trump petulantly threatens to sue him, and the artist, and Jesus, and the entire town—basically anyone who pisses him off. It’s also implied that he’s on the Epstein list.\n“Do you really want to end up like Colbert?” Jesus asks the townspeople, who are pushing back against forced Christianity in their kids’ school. He calls out Paramount by name, saying, “We’re going to get canceled, you idiots.”\nThe town strikes a deal with the president, forcing them to do pro-Trump messaging—a nod to Trump’s claim on Truth Social that Paramount’s “new owners” have agreed to give him $20 million in advertising and public service announcements in addition to the settlement. (Paramount told Deadline the settlement doesn’t include PSAs and said it “has no knowledge of any promises or commitments made to President Trump other than those set forth in the settlement proposed by the mediator and accepted by the parties.”) The show is then interrupted by a PSA, where a deepfake Trump stumbles around naked through the desert; this time, his genitals have a pair of googly eyes attached. “Trump: His penis is teeny-tiny, but his love for us is large,” a narrator says. The ad ends with text on a black backround: “He Gets Us. All Of Us.” “He Gets Us” is also the slogan used for an actual Christian ad campaign.\nYou can argue that portraying Trump as a narcissistic man-child and focusing so heavily on his appearance is lowbrow. But Nick Marx, an associate professor of film and media studies at Colorado State University, says it’s also a refreshing change from the defiant messaging of Colbert and others.\n“It’s fucking funny as hell that they seek to sexually humiliate Trump,” he claims, saying it’s an effective troll of what he believes to be the president’s “vanity and insecurity.”\n“I think that is the card to play … and I am frustrated that more of the comedians that I love on the left haven't leaned into that really harsh attack of him.”\nCritics of the episode on X issued complaints that “the left took over south park” and “this show is for libtards” while others outright expressed fear that Trump will get the show canceled, saying, “South Park was good while it lasted.”\nBut making small-dick jokes isn’t woke—it’s exactly that type of humor, along with an affinity for saying the r-word and racial and homophobic slurs that helped cultivate South Park’s right-wing audience. Marx thinks that’s a good thing for liberals.\n“Right-wing humorists, the Joe Rogans and Andrew Schulzes of the world, they're the ones occupying this offensive free-speech space. And so anything that the left can do to reclaim artists like Parker and Stone would be a benefit to them.”\nIn a meeting Thursday, the FCC’s Carr said he’s “not a ‘South Park’ watcher,” NBC News reports. He also said Trump is against “a handful of national programmers” who “control and dictate to the American what the narrative is, what they can say, what they can think.” But, while many of his attacks have focused on news organizations themselves—ABC, CBS, NPR, even The Wall Street Journal—censoring cherished entertainers could rile up members of the public who frankly may not care that much about the plight of journalists.\nThat’s something that Paramount, too, has to contend with now.\n“They just inked this $1.5 billion deal that, to me, is a gesture of full and unequivocal support from Paramount,” Marx says. “The syndication and streaming licenses that South Park draws are worth much, much more than they've been paying Parker and Stone over the years.” He says he wouldn’t be surprised if Parker and Stone got away with nothing more than a slap on the wrist.\nBut, as the episode itself indicated, Trump has been relentless with his lawsuit targets and openly bragged about getting Colbert fired and keeping the media in line.\nMichael Sozan, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, says he could absolutely see Paramount trying to tone down South Park’s content, considering that the company settled on “the flimsiest of lawsuits,” predicated on the claim that 60 Minutes edited an interview with Kamala Harris to make it more flattering to her. But he said doing so could “wake up a sleeping giant”: the public. The streamer has also promised Trump it will cancel its DEI initiatives.\n“A lot of American people are starting to be more and more aware of how Trump is trying to censor reporters, but now also just entertainment shows that he disagrees with it. That is something that authoritarians do,” he says. People could respond with outrage or boycotts.\nBut he cautions that’s not Paramount’s only problem as it clinches the $8 billion Skydance merger.\nAlready, senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have written a letter to Skydance CEO David Ellison seeking answers about the “secret side deal with President Trump” that allegedly offered him future PSAs. Trump has called Ellison’s father, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, a “friend.” California officials are also looking into whether the company engaged in bribery related to the deal, as Semafor reported.\n“If there's a Democratic administration and a Democratic Department of Justice starting three years from now, or Democratic House or Senate, Paramount also has opened itself up to the possibility of lots of investigations,” Sozan says.\nIt’s fascinating that South Park and late-night comics are issuing some of the harshest rebukes of Trump, though Sozan says satire—and joy—are considered by scholars to be an effective tool against authoritarians who “want to keep people depressed and in line.”\nHe thinks the backlash over Paramount’s mounting controversies could be a genuine “cultural flash point.”\nSo far, there’s no indication that Paramount plans to censor South Park. Then again, the Skydance merger has only just been greenlit.\nAt the end of the premiere episode, Cartman and Butters, seemingly stand-ins for Parker and Stone, try to kill themselves because Cartman is depressed that “woke is dead” and he has nothing to make fun of anymore.\n“I think I might be going,” Butters says. “Yep, sweet death is about to come. I love you man,” Cartman replies.\nFor fans of the show—and free speech in general—let’s hope that’s not true. But just in case, you should probably watch that episode now.","summary":"The White House says the show is “fourth-rate” after it showed Trump with “tiny” genitals.

South Park made its long-awaited return to television, premiering its first episode in two years with a scathing satire that targeted President Trump's personal life . The episode, titled \"Sermon on the Mount,\" featured a barrage of X-rated jokes about Trump's manhood, with one scene showing the devil rejecting Trump's advances in bed, saying, \"I can't even see anything it's so small.\" The show then took aim at Trump's involvement in the Epstein scandal, with Satan remarking, \"It's weird that whenever it comes up, you just tell everyone to relax.\" However, the episode took an unexpected turn when Trump launched a $5 billion lawsuit against the townsfolk, prompting Jesus to intervene and plead with the residents to settle the case. The lawsuit was eventually negotiated down to $3.5 billion, with the town agreeing to produce \"pro-Trump messaging\" in their public service announcements as part of the settlement. This plot twist was a reference to Trump's real-life lawsuit against Paramount, in which he claimed that a pre-election interview with Kamala Harris on 60 Minutes had been misleadingly edited, reports the Irish Star . In a statement given to Rolling Stone, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said: \"The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end - for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' [sic] content, but suddenly they are praising the show.\" Targeting the content of the contentious episode, he went on to say, \"Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows. \"This show hasn't been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.\" The spokesperson concluded, \"President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country's history - and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak.\" Before this statement was released, Rolling Stone reached out to several of Trump's advisers asking if they had seen the South Park episode. One senior administration official responded, \"Of course.\" Another adviser to the president revealed that they had also watched the episode and found it \"disappointing\", having been a long-time fan of the animated sitcom.

I'm absolutely convinced we're going to grow the House majority,\" Johnson told CBS News chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett on Wednesday. \"It's not groundless optimism. It's going to be the result of a lot of hard work.\"Historically, the president's party almost always loses ground in the midterms right after a presidential race. The party that controls the White House has only managed to improve its edge in the House in a midterm election twice in the last 80 years, in 1998 and 2002. That trend is typically driven by backlash against the incumbent president — and over the last six months, President Trump's approval rating has slid from 53% to 42%, according to CBS News polling. But Johnson said he believes his party has opportunities to go on offense, pointing to the 13 House Democrats who represent districts that Mr. Trump won in 2024, versus three Republicans whose districts went for former Vice President Kamala Harris. He also noted demographic shifts in the 2024 race, which saw Mr. Trump make gains with Black and Latino voters.\"I like those odds,\" Johnson said.Johnson also said a controversial plan by Texas Republicans to redraw the state's congressional districts \"probably inures to our benefit,\" though he also said, \"the jury's still out on that one\" and \"we're still awaiting the outcome.\" Johnson told CBS News on Wednesday the state's Republican Gov. Greg Abbott will \"need to follow the law\" and \"be fair.\"Johnson predicts \"Big, Beautiful Bill\" will serve as economic \"jet fuel\"Johnson predicted voters will \"feel the benefits\" of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. The legislation extends trillions of dollars' worth of tax cuts, appropriates new funding for border security, and adds or expands work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps.Some 61% of U.S. adults disapprove of the law, according to a CBS News poll released Sunday. Some 47% of Americans believe it will hurt them and their families, versus 28% who say it won't have much of an effect on their families and only 25% who say it will help them.\"I'm not surprised by those numbers, because they've gotten a steady diet of misinformation by most of the mainstream media and the Democrats,\" Johnson told CBS News.He predicted that the bill will serve as \"jet fuel\" for the economy, and pointed to an estimate by House Republicans that its tax provisions could deliver as much as $13,300 in extra take-home pay to the typical family. The White House's Council of Economic Advisers said in a report that a family with two children could see between $7,800 and $13,300 in additional take-home pay \"in the long run\" as a result of the bill.The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center found Americans from most income levels will see tax savings from the law next year, averaging $2,900 per household, though higher-income people will see a bigger impact. The group said $6 of every $10 in tax breaks will go to the top 20% of households, or people with incomes of about $217,000 or more.Asked if voters will hold Republicans accountable in the midterms for the bill's promised tax benefits, Johnson said: \"They'll see it, and they will vote accordingly.\"Johnson also hailed a set of crypto bills that are moving through Congress. Last week, Mr. Trump signed into law the GENIUS Act, which creates a regulatory structure for stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency pegged to the value of an asset like the U.S. dollar. Another bill that would set broader rules for digital assets, the CLARITY Act, is still pending.Johnson said of the crypto legislation: \"It will spur on innovation and more investment.

He called Mr. Trump \"the king of the art of the deal,\" and pointed to \"unfair trade practices\" by other countries.Many economists warn that higher tariffs could lead to steeper consumer prices and slower economic growth — though Mr. Trump has defended the strategy.\"The sky was going to fall, everybody told us, and it hasn't,\" Johnson said.He also said Congress has traditionally \"given a lot of latitude to the executive\" to negotiate trade deals, amid concern from some lawmakers that Congress should be involved in major tax policy rather than deferring to the president on tariffs.And Johnson called allegations that House Republicans have been overly deferential to Mr. Trump \"nonsense.\" He said he and Mr. Trump are \"working as a unified government,\" but he discusses contentious issues with the president \"behind the curtains.\"","summary":"House Speaker Mike Johnson told CBS News he's \"absolutely convinced\" Republicans will expand their House majority in the 2026 midterms.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/house-speaker-mike-johnson-very-bullish-on-gop-in-midterms/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/24/61b7ab4e-90e1-4344-b470-53ed8ed2fa25/thumbnail/1200x630/cb689b5983c0f28a84102441cfbc3727/mike-johnson.jpg","video":"https://prod.vodvideo.cbsnews.com/cbsnews/vr/hls/3924704_hls/master.m3u8","publish_date":"2025-07-24 22:06:00","author":"Joe Walsh","authors":["Joe Walsh"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.018},{"id":344976720,"title":"FCC approves Paramount-Skydance merger","text":"The Federal Communications Commission has cleared the way for Paramount Global to complete its merger with Skydance Media, announcing Thursday that it has approved the deal. The decision removes a final hurdle for the media and entertainment companies to close their transaction.The FCC's approval, which was necessary for the deal to move forward, caps a long-running corporate saga over the fate of Paramount, which owns Paramount+, the Paramount Pictures movie and television studios, the CBS television network and CBS News and Stations. Paramount also owns Nickelodeon, BET, MTV, Comedy Central and other media brands. Paramount Global agreed to merge with David Ellison's Skydance Media in July 2024 after briefly halting negotiations the month before. The deal followed a long, turbulent sales process that drew interest from other major corporate players and investors, including Seagram heir Edgar Bronfman Jr., media mogul Barry Diller, Sony Pictures and private equity firm Apollo Global Management, and Allen Media, the company controlled by former comedian Byron Allen. Paramount had said it expected to close the $8.4 billion merger in the first half of 2025. But the first half of the year came and went, and the merger remained under review by the FCC and its chair Brendan Carr, who had been appointed to the role earlier this year by President Trump.Late on July 1, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit with Mr. Trump over the editing of a \"60 Minutes\" interview with Kamala Harris, a suit that Paramount told the court was without merit. The company agreed to pay $16 million — most of which would go to Mr. Trump's presidential library — and agreed to publish transcripts of future \"60 Minutes\" interviews with presidential candidates after those interviews air on the show. Mr. Trump has since said he expects Paramount's new owners to offer him about $20 million in advertising and PSAs. Paramount said in a statement it had no knowledge of any commitments to Mr. Trump outside of its $16 million settlement, and Skydance didn't respond to requests for comment.In two letters to the FCC earlier this week, Skydance pledged to hire a CBS News ombudsman to review complaints of editorial bias for a period of at least two years, and the company confirmed that Paramount had eliminated or modified its DEI programs and hiring practices earlier this year.","summary":"Paramount Global and Skydance Media agreed to merge last year.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/fcc-approves-paramount-skydance-merger/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/07/02/aedd4edd-6001-4152-aeda-2d4a8b82e8fd/thumbnail/1200x630/a7355666a9a1f70e7b465558cc01a378/paramount-logo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 22:06:00","author":"President Trump","authors":["President Trump"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.085},{"id":344972048,"title":"FCC approves Paramount-Skydance merger following protracted political tug-of-war","text":"David Ellison stepped within reach of his hard-fought prize, Paramount Global, after winning regulators' blessing for his Skydance Media's $8-billion takeover of the storied media company. The Federal Communications Commission, led by President Trump-appointed Chairman Brendan Carr, approved the Skydance-Paramount merger Thursday after months of turmoil and a monumental collision between the president's broad powers and press freedoms. Carr's consent came just three weeks after Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle the president's lawsuit over edits to a \"60 Minutes\" broadcast. Trump had claimed CBS producers doctored the October interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris to boost her election chances. CBS denied his allegations, saying the edits were routine. 1st Amendment experts called Trump's suit \"frivolous.\" But, after months of internal upheaval, Paramount capitulated. The move was widely seen as a prerequisite for Skydance to win FCC approval and push the Paramount-Skydance merger over the finish line. Trump has said on social media that, as part of the settlement, he also expects the new owners to provide another $20 million in public service announcements and other free programming. The FCC approval clears the final regulatory hurdle for the acquisition that will bring another technology titan to Hollywood. Carr authorized the transfer of Paramount's CBS television station licenses to Larry Ellison, Oracle's co-founder who ranks among the world's richest men, and his family. “Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly. It is time for a change,\" Carr said in a statement. \"That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.” The FCC commissioners voted 2-1 in favor of the deal. Two Republicans, Carr and Olivia Trusty, voted yes, while Anna Gomez, the lone Democrat on the panel, dissented. “After months of cowardly capitulation to this Administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted,\" Gomez said in a statement. \"Unfortunately, it is the American public who will ultimately pay the price for its actions.\" The Ellisons' takeover of Paramount is expected to be complete in the coming days. FCC approval came the day after Comedy Central's \"South Park\" launched its 27th season with a scathing episode that skewered both Paramount and Trump, who was depicted nude and in bed with Satan, mirroring the show's past portrayals of Saddam Hussein. Santa Monica-based Skydance, which is owned by the Ellison family and private equity firm RedBird Capital Partners, faces an uphill slog to restore Paramount to its former glory. Years of programming underinvestments, management missteps and ownership turmoil have taken a heavy toll. Viewers' shift to streaming has upended Paramount's TV networks: CBS, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, MTV and BET. Paramount Pictures lags behind Disney, Universal and Warner Bros. Sumner Redstone's family will exit the Hollywood stage after nearly 40 years. The pugnacious mogul from Boston, who died five years ago, presided during an era of entertainment excesses in the 80s, 90s and early aughts — when Paramount released beloved blockbusters and cable television was in its heyday. For a stretch this spring, it seemed the Skydance deal could unravel. The FCC's review had stalled amid the legal wrangling over Trump's lawsuit. Carr, in one of his first moves as chairman, separately opened an FCC inquiry into alleged news distortion with the \"60 Minutes\" Harris interview — putting CBS uncomfortably under the microscope. Paramount's controlling shareholder Shari Redstone (Sumner's daughter), and some Skydance executives, urged Paramount to settle. But CBS News executives refused to apologize to Trump for the \"60 Minutes\" edits, saying CBS journalists did nothing wrong. The settlement, which steers money to Trump's future presidential library, did not include an apology from CBS News or Paramount. Two high-level CBS News executives departed and three progressive U.S. senators demanded answers. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and the others lambasted the settlement talks, saying that paying Trump money to end a \"bogus\" lawsuit simply to get a merger approved could be akin to paying a bribe. The winds shifted in June. David Ellison, Larry's 42-year-old son, talked briefly with Trump at a UFC fight in New Jersey. Days later, Trump talked favorably about his friendship with Larry Ellison and the Paramount-Skydance deal. \"Ellison’s great,” Trump told reporters in mid-June. “He’ll do a great job with it.” David Ellison last week met with Carr in Washington to persuade him that Paramount would be in good hands. They discussed the firm's commitments and management philosophies. Skydance also gave assurances that Chinese investors would not have a say in the company's affairs. Last week, CBS separately said it was canceling “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert,” in May. The company said the move was financial, but conservatives and progressives alike questioned the timing due to the pending merger and Colbert's pointed barbs at Trump. Skydance outlined its planned changes at Paramount in a letter this week to Carr. Skydance promised to cancel all diversity initiatives, disband its Office of Global Inclusion and strip references to DEI from its internal and external messaging. The company also said news and entertainment programming would not tilt in any one political direction. \"New Paramount’s new management will ensure that the company’s array of news and entertainment programming embodies a diversity of viewpoints across the political and ideological spectrum, consistent with the varying perspectives of the viewing audience,” Skydance's general counsel Stephanie Kyoko McKinnon wrote in Tuesday's letter to Carr. The company said it would install an ombudsman at CBS News for at least two years. \"They are committing to serious changes at CBS,\" Carr told reporters in Washington earlier Thursday. \"I think that would be a good thing. They’ve committed to addressing bias issues. They committed to embracing fact-based journalism.\" Ellison began his pursuit of Paramount two years ago. He formalized his bid by January 2024. After months of negotiations, Paramount's board and Redstone approved the Skydance takeover July 7, 2024. Paramount's leaders considered other prospective owners but concluded that Skydance, with its Ellison backing, would bring a solid financial foundation for a company that traces its roots back more than a century. Redstone also wanted Paramount to remain whole, rather than broken into pieces. As part of the agreement, Skydance will be folded into the public company. Its backers will inject new capital to bolster Paramount's finances and install a new cadre of leaders. Ellison will serve as chairman and chief executive. Former NBCUniversal Chief Executive Jeff Shell is slated to be president. CBS' current leader George Cheeks, one of Paramount's three co-chief executives, could join the new regime. But the two other current chiefs, Chris McCarthy and Brian Robbins, are expected to depart. The Skydance deal is expected to be executed in two parts. Larry Ellison and RedBird will buy out the Redstone family holding company, National Amusements Inc., for $2.4 billion. After their debts are paid, the Redstone family will leave with $1.75 billion. The family controls 77% of Paramount's voting shares, which will be passed to the Ellisons and RedBird. Under the deal terms, the new Paramount will offer to buy out some shares of existing shareholders and inject $1.5 billion into Paramount's strained balance sheet. Paramount will then absorb Skydance, which has a movie, television, animation, video games and sports unit. The deal values Skydance at $4.75 billion. \"We're going to reorganize and restructure the business to prioritize cash flow generation,\" David Ellison told investors last July. \"With a track record in both entertainment and technological expertise [we will] be able to transition the company through this period of time to ensure that Paramount's brightest days are ahead.\"","summary":"The Larry Ellison family and RedBird Capital Partners are expected to take control of Paramount in the coming days.

(CBS News itself called the suit \"completely without merit.\") In the episode, the town of South Park protests against Trump. In retaliation, Trump sues the town, forcing them to pay Trump a considerable sum and produce a number of pro-Trump PSAs as part of a settlement.The PSA shown at the end of the episode is extra-NSFW, showing an AI deepfake of Trump taking off his clothes in the desert.

Trump, and I endorse this message.\"The PSA's voiceover declares: \"His penis is teeny tiny, but his love for us is large.\"Trump's White House is decidedly unhappy about the episode. According to Rolling Stone, a Trump adviser who has long been a fan of the series found it \"disappointing.\" In a statement sent to Variety, Rolling Stone, and The Hollywood Reporter among other outlets, White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said: \"The Left’s hypocrisy truly has no end — for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' (sic) content, but suddenly they are praising the show.

The deal is valued at $1.5 billion.South Park's takedown of Trump and specifically the Paramount settlement comes a little over a week after Stephen Colbert ripped into that same settlement on The Late Show.

Three weeks ago, Paramount, CBS News’s parent company, agreed to pay President Trump $16 million to settle a lawsuit over the editing of an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that aired last October on “60 Minutes.” Mr. Trump claimed that CBS’s actions misled viewers and were aimed at tipping the scales in favor of the Democratic Party.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed as Shari Redstone, Paramount’s leader, was in the midst of a multibillion-dollar deal to sell her company to a Hollywood studio, Skydance. The Trump administration needs to sign off on the deal, and some Democratic lawmakers have characterized the settlement as a bribe to get the merger approved.\n\nBoth Paramount and the Trump administration have said the lawsuit and the merger are unrelated.\n\nMs. Simon joined the staff of “60 Minutes” in 2000, and before her interim role had been the show’s executive editor. She will be the fourth executive producer for the program since it began in 1968, and the first woman in the role.\n\n“Tanya Simon understands what makes ’60 Minutes’ tick,” Tom Cibrowski, president and executive editor of CBS News, said in a statement. “She is an innovative leader, an exceptional producer, and someone who knows how to inspire people.”\n\nCecilia Vega and Sharyn Alfonsi, two of the program’s correspondents, posted congratulatory messages on Instagram, writing, “We’re in good hands.”","summary":"Tanya Simon, who has worked on the show for over two decades, will take over at a time of significant change for the network.","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/24/business/media/60-minutes-tanya-simon-cbs.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/07/24/multimedia/24biz-60-minutes-mbtf/24biz-60-minutes-mbtf-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 20:55:28","author":"Emmett Lindner","authors":["Emmett Lindner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":344984154,"title":"Jimmy Kimmel tempts fate with Trump 'genius' joke amid late show carnage","text":"SHARE SELECTION\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Jul 25th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInside Hulk Hogan's 'emotional' final hours: Friends in shock over sudden death... as they reveal his deathbed 'heartbreak'\n\nHow 'drug-addicted cross-dresser who abused former lover' was left to brutally murder his own two-week-old son on hospital ward - despite social services vowing to take boy away to safety before he was even born\n\nKelly Osbourne breaks her silence following the death of her father Ozzy as she says 'I lost the best friend I ever had' in heartbreaking tribute\n\nI spent four nights a week drinking until I blacked out - before snorting cocaine to sober up.

It criticized Paramount's $16 million settlement with Trump, CBS's cancellation of Stephen Colbert's \"The Late Show (CBS is owned by Paramount), made jokes about the Epstein files, and showcased scenes of Trump cozying up in bed with Satan.The episode ended with an AI deepfake of President Donald Trump walking naked through the desert.It prompted a seething response from the White House, with a spokesperson saying \"no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump's hot streak.\"The episode put a spotlight on \"South Park's\" ownership structure and licensing deals. It airs on Comedy Central, which is also owned by Paramount through its MTV Entertainment Group division. Under the terms of the new 50-episode Paramount deal struck by show creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker, the past 26 seasons of \"South Park\" are now exclusively available to stream on Paramount+ in the US.CBS earlier this week said its decision to end Colbert's popular nightly series after more than three decades was due to financial considerations. Reports indicated the show was losing more than $40 million a year. Critics of the move, including late-night TV hosts such as Comedy Central's Jon Stewart, ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, and NBC's Jimmy Fallon, suggested the decision was politically motivated.Paramount earlier this month agreed to pay Trump a $16 million settlement over a lawsuit the president filed against the company, which accused CBS's \"60 Minutes\" of \"deceptive editing\" of its October interview with former vice president Kamala Harris. Colbert referenced the settlement, which didn't include an apology or a statement of regret, in an episode on July 14 titled \"A Big Bribe.\"In a post on Truth Social a few days later, Trump cheered the end of Colbert's show, characterizing it as a firing.Wednesday's \"South Park\" episode repeatedly took shots at Paramount and Trump, who was represented in animated and AI deepfake form.Parts of the episode showed Trump with his face on a blurred, animated naked body cozying up in bed with Satan, a recurring character on the show. It also includes jokes about the Trump administration's lawsuits against media companies, as well as his genitalia.\"The Left's hypocrisy truly has no end,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement to Business Insider. \"For years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as 'offense' content, but suddenly they are praising the show.\"Rogers added that Wednesday's episode is \"a desperate attempt for attention.\"Hey, Satan! pic.twitter.com/JQzbcWVUbmParamount did not respond to a request for comment.\"South Park\" first aired in 1997 CBS's Comedy Central and quickly became a hit known for raunchy, no-holds-barred satire. Its episodes have directly poked fun at sensitive topics ranging from religion and gender identity to school shootings and child abuse. Though animated, it's targeted to adults and frequently contains profanity.The episode's plot includes commentary on religion in public schools and a storyline in which Trump sues the fictional town of South Park, Colorado, for criticizing his actions in the White House.Its recurring character Jesus also makes an appearance before the town's citizens, saying the only reason he is at the town's school is because \"of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount.\"\"The guy can do whatever he wants now that someone has backed down,\" the Jesus character says, in reference to Trump.\"You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount,\" the character continues. \"You really want to end up like Colbert?

This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention.”\n\nThe offending cartoon episode ridiculed Trump’s personality, as well as his failures and iniquities since taking office. Creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone also took aim at the show’s own parent company, Paramount, for its two capitulations to Trump: canceling The Late Show With Stephen Colbert and settling with Trump over 60 Minutes’s editing of its 2024 interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nStone and Parker also delivered some lower blows, depicting Trump with a “teeny-tiny” penis and portraying the president literally in bed with Satan (a recurring character on the show).","summary":"In an apparent effort to get out ahead of Ghislaine Maxwell’s testimony, Donald Trump’s media allies have decided to saddle up beside the prolific sex trafficker.\n\nThe Justice Department is reportedly meeting with Maxwell on Thursday and Friday, ahead of her scheduled deposition with the House Oversight Committee on August 11. The interviews follow weeks of mounting pressure on Trump from his base, who have clamored for more transparency regarding the Epstein files after the Justice Department contradicted prior statements from Attorney General Pam Bondi on the existence of Jeffrey Epstein’s supposed client list.\n\nOffering Maxwell as fodder to Trump’s hungry followers is a fascinating carrot-and-stick option to alleviate some of that tension, but convincing her to talk would almost certainly require some kind of deal—an option that pro-Trump conservative media networks started to imagine this week.\n\nOn Monday, Newsmax host Greg Kelly had already started to dabble in the new media line, suggesting on air that ","url":"https://newrepublic.com/post/198399/maga-ghislaine-maxwell-help-donald-trump-epstein","image":"https://images.newrepublic.com/832de9f3af0dff25a9c2f1095db59f3d9a24290b.jpeg?w=1200&h=630&crop=faces&fit=crop&fm=jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 19:33:53","author":"Ellie Quinlan Houghtaling","authors":["Ellie Quinlan Houghtaling"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.044},{"id":344937854,"title":"Trump’s FCC chair plays coy on Fox News when asked if president involved in Colbert’s cancellation","text":"Days after both he and Donald Trump gloated that CBS had canceled Stephen Colbert’s late-night show, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr wouldn’t give a direct answer when asked on Fox News whether the president played a part in The Late Show’s demise.\n\nCarr’s ambiguity regarding whether Trump was directly involved in the decision to end a long-running program hosted by an outspoken critic of the president comes amid CBS parent company Paramount’s pending merger with Skydance Media, which the FCC chief is responsible for approving.\n\nTrump’s hand-picked top media regulator also took the opportunity on Thursday to say that it’s “entirely possible” that ABC’s The View could be in the administration’s “crosshairs” after the White House called View host Joy Behar an “irrelevant loser” while suggesting “her show is next to be pulled off air.”\n\nInterviewing Carr on Thursday morning’s broadcast of America’s Newsroom, Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer stated that CBS was still reeling from the fallout from the sudden announcement that Colbert’s show will come to an end next year. Hemmer also noted that CBS morning anchor Tony Dokoupil recently broke from his network colleagues – who believe the decision was politically motivated – and defended his corporate bosses.\n\nAt the same time, Hemmer kicked off the interview with Carr by saying he wanted to get something “out of the way,” and that was whether Trump had “anything to do with the cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s show.” The Trump official, however, played coy with his response.\n\n“What is important to keep in mind is when President Trump ran for election, he ran right at these legacy broadcast media outfits and the New York and Hollywood elites that are behind it, and he smashed the facade that they are gatekeepers that control what Americans can think and what Americans can say,” Carr responded.\n\n“Once you do that, you have exposed a business model of a lot of these outfits as being nothing more than a partisan circus. So I think there are a lot of consequences that are flowing from President Trump deciding, I won’t play by the rules of politicians in the past and let these legacy outfits dictate the narrative and terms of the debate,” he continued. “He is succeeding.”\n\nCarr then went on to suggest that even if Trump hadn’t played a direct role in the cancellation of Colbert’s show, the president’s ongoing war with the legacy media was the key factor in the decision.\n\n“Look at what is happening. NPR has been defunded, PBS has been defunded, Colbert is getting canceled,” the chairman boasted. “You’ve got anchors and news media personalities losing jobs downstream of President Trump’s decision to stand up. He stood up for the American people. The American people don’t trust the legacy gatekeepers anymore.”\n\nHemmer, meanwhile, pointed out that he had asked Carr “a very direct question,” but “did not hear a yes or a no in your answer.” Instead, as the Fox anchor noted, he “heard a maybe.”\n\nCarr’s non-committal response comes two days after Skydance’s general counsel sent him a pair of letters confirming that New Paramount will eliminate all diversity, equity and inclusivity policies and hire an ombudsman to review “complaints of bias” at CBS News once the merger is complete. \n\nAdditionally, Carr also met with Skydance CEO David Ellison days before it was announced that Colbert was leaving and The Late Show franchise would come to an end. At the meeting, according to regulatory filings, Ellison asked Carr to “promptly grant” Paramount’s request to transfer over its broadcast licenses while promising CBS would be “unbiased” under the new corporate leadership.\n\nThe Ellison meeting also took place shortly after Paramount agreed to pay Trump $16 million to settle his “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, leading Democratic lawmakers and free press groups to threaten lawsuits and criminal investigations into whether Paramount violated anti-bribery laws with the settlement.\n\nColbert himself has called the payoff a “big fat bribe” in order to help push the merger through, and he has since cast doubt that his show’s cancellation was based on a “purely financial decision,” as Paramount insisted in its announcement. CBS staffers agree with this sentiment. “Many of us think this was part and parcel of the Trump shakedown settlement,” one network staffer told The Independent. \n\nBesides celebrating the Late Show’s cancellation, Trump has also repeatedly claimed that he reached a side deal with Skydance as part of the settlement, asserting that Ellison has promised him as much as $20 million in pro-Trump advertisements and PSAs on CBS programming once the merger is complete. Paramount has denied knowledge of any secret behind-the-scenes arrangement with the incoming owner.\n\nElsewhere in the Fox News interview, Hemmer read the White House’s recent threatening message to The View, wondering if this meant that the ABC daytime talk show – which is well-known for its anti-Trump stance – is “now in the crosshairs of this administration.”\n\nCarr, who is seen as a MAGA “attack dog” and loyal foot soldier in Trump’s onslaught against the mainstream media, suggested he could soon be taking aim at the show.\n\n“Look, it’s entirely possible that there’s issues over there,” he replied. “Stepping back, this broader dynamic [that] once President Trump has exposed these media gatekeepers and smashed this facade, there are a lot of consequences. I think the consequences of that aren’t quite finished.”\n\nAsked where this could end, Carr said that “we need a course correction” and it’s “time for America’s’ legacy broadcasters to return to promoting the public interest.” He then applauded Skydance for committing to eradicating diversity hiring initiatives and hiring an ombudsman before, adding that “that’s where we have to go.”Notably, Carr’s remarks about The View come months after he opened an investigation into ABC and its parent company Disney – which paid Trump $16 million last year to settle a defamation suit – over its DEI policies, claiming that the corporation may have violated the FCC’s equal employment opportunity regulations. \n\nEarlier this year, it was reported that Disney chief Bob Iger explicitly asked The View’s hosts to tone down its anti-Trump rhetoric and pull back on political segments.","summary":"‘Look at what is happening.

He entertained fans from all over the World, and the cultural impact he had was massive. To his wife, Sky, and family, we give our warmest best wishes and love. Hulk Hogan will be greatly missed!”\n\nThe president wasn’t the only prominent MAGA figure to pay tribute to Hogan, real name Terry Bollea. Top Republicans, from the vice president to members of Congress and other activists weighed in as well.\n\nWriting on X, Vice President JD Vance called Hogan a “great American icon” and said the wrestler had been “one of the first people” he’d “ever truly admired as a kid.”\n\n“The last time I saw him we promised we’d get beers together next time we saw each other. The next time will have to be on the other side, my friend! Rest in peace,” Vance added.\n\nHogan was perhaps the biggest star in World Wrestling Entertainment history, and served as a major draw to the company’s first WrestleMania event in 1985 and remained a fixture for years, facing everyone from Andre The Giant and Randy Savage to The Rock and even company chairman Vince McMahon.\n\nThe wresting star, who like Trump rose to public attention in the Reagan era, endorsed his fellow Floridian at the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee in a bombastic speech that married his longstanding wrestling act with President Donald Trump’s rhetoric.\n\nTaking to the stage to his wrestling theme tune “Real American”, Hogan roared: “Well, let me tell you something brother!!” – one of his biggest catch phrases during his professional career.\n\nAs Trump and a capacity crowd at the Fiserv Forum applauded, Hogan removed his blazer and tore off his shirt to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign T-shirt underneath. He cried out: “Let Trumpamania run wild! Let Trumpamania rule again! Let Trumpamania make America Great Again!” \n\n“What happened last week...when they took a shot at my hero....They tried to kill the greatest president of the United States!” he bellowed, a week after an assassin nearly killed Trump in Butler, Penn. \n\n“Enough was enough!!” Hogan growled.\n\nHogan and wife, Sky, also sat in the Trump family box with the president during the RNC.\n\nHe went on the attack Trump’s opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, a few weeks later at an event to promote his “Real American” beer in Ohio, when he made racially charged comments about the vice president and suggested he could perform wrestling moves on her.\n\nHogan asked the rowdy crowd: “Do you want me to drop the leg on Kamala…Do you want me to body slam Kamala Harris?”\n\nHe then asked the crowd: “Is Kamala a chameleon? Is she Indian?” \n\nPerhaps realizing he had crossed a line, Hogan appeared to blame alcohol for his behavior. \n\n“I’m gonna get heat for that one, brother…that was not me, that was the beers talking,” he said.\n\nTrump’s statement on his longtime friend’s passing came after multiple top figures in the Trump-era Republican Party took to social media to offer messages of condolence and mourning following news of the wrestling star’s death.\n\nHis hometown congresswoman, Florida Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, took to X to say it had been an honor to represent the star in Congress.\n\n“RIP to the great Hulk Hogan, who lived right here in FL-13. It was an honor to be your Representative. Gone, but the legend of Hulkamania will run wild forever,” she said.\n\nThe next GOP figure in the presidential line of succession, House Speaker Mike Johnson, wrote on Instagram that Americans “all have fond memories” of the late wrestler. \n\n“From my childhood in the ’80s, to campaigning with him last year, I always saw him as a giant in stature and in life. May he rest in peace,” he said.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth also posted a message of condolence on X consisting of a photo of the iconic star holding an American flag and the letters “RIP.”\n\nYet another prominent Trump-world figure and a child of the 1980s, the president’s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., also mourned Hogan in an X post containing a photo of both men at last year’s Republican convention and the words: “RIP to a legend.”\n\nBlake Marnell, the Trump rally mainstay who is known for the brick wall-patterned suits he wears, similarly posted on X to express grief at Hogan’s passing.\n\nMarnell recalled the last time he’d seen the wrestler, at Trump’s 2024 pre-election rally held at Madison Square Garden.\n\nHe added: “RIP, Brother!”","summary":"The president called the wrestling icon a ‘great friend’ and hailed his ‘massive’ cultural impact over the years","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/hulk-hogan-death-trump-maga-rnc-b2795463.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/07/24/17/46/W4AWRG.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/GwgCsmRU-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-07-24 19:21:29","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.311},{"id":344947616,"title":"Meet Stephen Colbert's Biggest Fans: Congressional Democrats","text":"Not even Stephen Colbert can survive the changes that are underway at large media organizations. CBS announced earlier this week that the network is canceling The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, a program that has existed in some form for 33 years—the last 10 of which were helmed by Colbert.\n\nHe's not exiting the airwaves immediately; the show will limp on for another 10 months. Still, the timing of the news has raised the suspicions of liberal viewers. CBS' parent company, Paramount, is attempting to sell to the media company Skydance: a merger that requires the approval of the Trump administration's Federal Communications Commission (FCC). (President Donald Trump recently sued CBS after he claimed the network improperly edited a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris during the 2024 election cycle. The network settled for $16 million.)\n\nParamount does not want to anger Trump right now, out of fear that his FCC could kill the sale. Perhaps axing a notoriously anti-Trump comedian was another component of the deal—or at the very least, Paramount hoped it might please the administration.\n\nPrivate media companies feeling compelled to kowtow to a thin-skinned president on matters of speech is obviously a terrible situation. But there are other, more benign explanations for the Colbert cancellation: His show was reportedly losing $40 million a year. In the heyday of late-night, a program like The Late Show could justify a massive budget, a staff of over 200 people, and $15 million for a host. But people aren't watching nearly as much cable television anymore; modern consumers get their entertainment and news from streaming and social media. YouTube has won the war for your attention, and everybody else is going to have to get leaner in order to survive at all.\n\nGiven that, it's not really surprising the company would decide to retire an incredibly expensive product that doesn't really fit with the times. Young people don't really want to watch increasingly stale comedians making somewhat obvious jokes about Trump with in-studio audiences laughing on cue. They find this setup quaint and bizarre.\n\nThis is a long way of saying that you don't have to buy into some sinister Trumpian explanation for why Colbert is getting canceled. Even Keith Olbermann, who is perhaps the most relentlessly partisan, hysterically anti-Trump mainstream progressive commentator on the planet, thinks that all things being equal, this was probably just a business decision.\n\nAaron? If they fired him to appease Trump, why are they letting him remain on the air as a lame duck, with nobody to stop him saying whatever he wants, for the next TEN MONTHS? They may have timed it to use it as a sop to Trump but this is like Phil Donahue getting cancelled.\n— Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) July 22, 2025\n\nWhen even Olbermann is providing a much-needed sanity check, it says something.\n\nBiggest Fans\n\nOther late-night hosts are standing with Colbert: Jon Stewart railed against CBS in a \"go fuck yourself\" musical rant. And to be fair, Trump is certainly acting like he had something to do with all of this, even implying that next he's going to get Jimmy Kimmel and Jimmy Fallon off the air.\n\nThe most surprising—not entirely expected might be a better way of putting it—display of solidarity, however, is coming not from other late-night hosts but from the upper echelons of the Democratic Party. Democratic congressman after Democratic congressman has weighed in to demand Colbert's reinstatement, as if he were some important general whom Trump had fired unceremoniously. Rep. Ted Lieu (D–Calif.) circulated a petition demanding that CBS bring back Colbert, and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I–Vt.) objected to the suspicious timing of the cancellation. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) has posted about it on X multiple times.\n\nWhat I find strangest about their objections is that the Democratic Party is very much associated with the idea that the federal government should micromanage the mergers and acquisitions of private companies. In fact, it's a textbook progressive opinion. While some Republican politicians have recently become more enamored with antitrust, it's leftist progressives like Warren and Sanders who have historically led the charge to give the federal government more authority over exactly the kind of business deal that Paramount and Skydance are attempting to pull off.\n\nAnd it's not as if Democrats have generally refrained from bullying private companies over speech-related decisions. In 2021, Democratic lawmakers sent threatening letters to Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, and other cable providers in order to persuade them to stop carrying conservative news channels. Warren herself has a long and storied history of vowing to regulate private companies because she doesn't like what they're saying. Former President Joe Biden said Facebook was morally responsible for COVID-19 deaths because it wouldn't delete vaccine-skeptical content, and his comms team implied that regulation was right around the corner if the social media giants did not fall in line.\n\nPerhaps progressives expected that the sort of people doing oversight and regulation with respect to such transactions would always and only be high-minded liberals with no political agendas of their own, simmering grievances, or axes to grind.

South Park’s 27th season premiere on Wednesday depicted the president in bed with Satan while talking about his alleged Jeffrey Epstein cover-up, and took shots at his recent settlement with Paramount. Both scenes included crude depictions of his genitalia. \"This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told Fox News Digital. \"President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history – and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak.\" 'GONE TOO FAR': GOP LAWMAKERS RALLY AROUND TRUMP AFTER MUSK RAISES EPSTEIN ALLEGATIONS The episode featured Trump suing the town of South Park and eventually reaching a settlement with the fictional Colorado town for $3.5 million and a commitment to produce pro-Trump public service ads (PSA). In one of the ads, a lifelike depiction of an overweight Trump was shown walking through a desert. A voiceover for the ad stated, \"Donald J. Trump. No matter how hot it gets, he’s not afraid to fight for America.\" As the scene continued, Trump stripped off his clothes and collapsed onto the sand naked. The next shot featured his penis – shown as comically small – rising and stating, \"I’m Donald J. Trump and I endorse this message.\" The voiceover added, \"Trump. His penis is teeny-tiny but his love for us is large.\" DEMOCRATS CAPITALIZE ON GOP JEFFREY EPSTEIN FALLOUT WITH NEW DEMANDS FOR JIM JORDAN The mock PSA appeared to be a parody of Trump’s recent settlement with CBS and parent company Paramount Global. Trump has said the settlement includes an eight-figure allocation set aside for advertisements, public service announcements, or other similar transmissions, in support of conservative causes by the network in the future, that will be paid for by incoming owners following a long-planned merger. South Park, which reached a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Paramount on Monday, which also reportedly includes 10 new episodes a year. The show's creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, took shots at Paramount earlier this month after its season premiere was delayed by two weeks. On X, the show’s official account blamed the pending Paramount and Skydance merger for its delay. \"This merger is a s---show and it’s f---ing up South Park,\" Parker and Stone said. \"We are at the studio working on new episodes, and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.\" Elsewhere in the episode, Trump was shown dodging accusations of hiding the details of sex predator Jeffrey Epstein’s case from the public, including accusations from Satan, who was depicted as Trump’s lover. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE As Trump stripped off his clothes to get into bed with Satan – revealing his genitalia again – Satan mentioned he heard that the president was on the Epstein list. \"The Epstein list? Are we still talking about that?,\" Trump responded. \"Well, are you on the list or not? It’s weird that whenever it comes up, you just tell everyone to relax,\" Satan continued. Trump replied, \"I’m not telling everyone to relax! Relax, guy!\" The scene appeared to be mocking Trump for rebuking his supporters who continue to ask about the Epstein files. Earlier this month, the DOJ and the FBI released a memo concluding that Epstein committed suicide in his cell, there is no \"client list,\" and the supposed \"Epstein files\" are thousands of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography subject to court-ordered sealing. Since then, Trump has ordered Attorney General Pam Bondi to work on releasing more files related to the Epstein case. ‘60 MINUTES’ KAMALA HARRIS INTERVIEW AT THE CENTER OF TRUMP'S CBS LAWSUIT RECEIVES EMMY NOMINATION The White House also criticized liberals who are now praising South Park when they had previously called it offensive. \"The Left’s hypocrisy truly has no end – for years they have come after South Park for what they labeled as ‘offense’ content, but suddenly they are praising the show. Just like the creators of South Park, the Left has no authentic or original content, which is why their popularity continues to hit record lows,\" Rogers told Fox News Digital.

Tony Evers says he won't seek third term","text":"Wisconsin's Democratic governor, Tony Evers, announced Thursday that he will not seek a third term in 2026, creating the first open race for governor in the battleground state in 16 years. It will be Wisconsin's highest profile race next year, as Democrats also angle to take control of the Legislature thanks to redrawn election maps that are friendlier to the party. They are also targeting two congressional districts as Democrats nationwide try to retake the House. The Legislature has been under Republican control since 2011, and some Democrats had hoped that Evers, 73, would run for a third term to give him a chance to potentially work with a Democratic-controlled one. In a video announcing his decision, Evers said he was \"damn proud\" of working 50 years in public service. But he said it was time to focus on his family.\"For five decades, my family has sacrificed to give me the gift of service,\" Evers said. \"They're my world and I owe it to them to focus on doing all the things we enjoy and love doing together.\"Evers has drawn the ire of President Trump's administration, and his tenure has been marked by his often contentious relationship with the Legislature. Before Evers even took office, Republicans convened a lame-duck session to pass a package of laws to weaken his power.Evers angered Republicans during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when he ordered schools and nonessential businesses to close, issued a statewide mask mandate and tried, unsuccessfully, to delay the state's April presidential primary.Republicans broke with tradition to reject 21 Evers appointees. They also blocked many of his proposals, including expanding Medicare, legalizing marijuana and spending more on child care, K-12 schools and higher education.Evers used his broad veto powers to stop Republicans from enacting a wide range of conservative priorities, including making voting requirements more strict, expanding gun rights, growing the private school voucher program and making abortions more difficult to obtain.But Evers did work with Republicans to pass the most recent state budget, which included $1.5 billion in tax cuts prioritized by the GOP and more funding for both K-12 special education and the University of Wisconsin. Evers also worked with Republicans to keep the Brewers in Milwaukee and funnel more money to local governments.Evers pushed for the redrawing of Wisconsin's legislative boundary lines, which the state Supreme Court ordered after liberal justices gained a majority in 2023.The maps drawn by Republicans, which had been in place for more than a decade, were widely regarded as among the most gerrymandered in the country. The new maps drawn by Evers are more favorable to Democrats and helped them pick up seats in last November's election. Democrats are optimistic that they can win control of at least one legislative chamber next year.Evers waited until after he signed the state budget before making his retirement announcement. \"I promised you when I ran for this office that I'd always work to do the right thing, that I'd always give it to you straight, and that I'd always try to be a governor for all of Wisconsin. And I work every day to keep those promises. That'll never change,\" he said.The open race is sure to attract several Democratic and Republican candidates. Democrats mentioned as potential candidates include Attorney General Josh Kaul, Lt. Gov. Sarah Rodriguez, state Sen. Kelda Roys, Secretary of State Sarah Godlewski, Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson and Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley.Washington County Executive Josh Schoemann and suburban Milwaukee businessman Bill Berrien are running as Republicans. Others, including U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany and state Senate President Mary Felzkowski, are considering it.The last open race for governor was in 2010, when Democratic incumbent Jim Doyle, similar to Evers, opted not to seek a third term. Republican Scott Walker won that year and served two terms before Evers defeated him in 2018.The only Wisconsin governor to be elected to a third four-year term was Republican Tommy Thompson, who served from 1986 to 2001. He resigned midway through his fourth term.Evers won the gubernatorial race in 2018 by little more than a percentage point. In 2022, he fended off a challenge from Trump-endorsed Tim Michels.Before being elected governor, Evers worked for 10 years as state superintendent of education after a career as a teacher and school administrator.Evers positioned himself as a folksy governor who would sprinkle the occasional mild swear word into his comments and other Midwestern colloquialisms such as \"holy mackerel\" and \"folks.\" His mild-mannered demeanor stood in stark contrast to Trump and other political firebrands. \"I think he is the most quintessential Wisconsin politician I've ever seen,\" said Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, who has been in elected office since 1991.Evers went viral during the 2024 Democratic National Convention when he — surrounded by a group of cheesehead-wearing supporters — said he was \"jazzed as hell\" to cast votes for Kamala Harris. After winning reelection in 2022, Evers noted that he is frequently described as boring, but said: \"As it turns out, boring wins.\"The Democratic Governors Association issued a statement Thursday, calling his governorship \"transformative for Wisconsin,\" and adding he \"successfully passed fair electoral maps after years of extreme partisan gerrymandering, challenged Wisconsin's pre-Civil War abortion ban, funded public schools for the next four hundred years with a stroke of his pen, and cut taxes by over $1.4 billion.\"","summary":"Democratic Gov.

A 2011 poll found that two-thirds of Palestinians believed that their real goal should not be a two-state solution, but rather using that arrangement as a prelude to establishing “one Palestinian state.” A 2016 survey found that nearly half of Israeli Jews agreed that “Arabs should be expelled or transferred from Israel.” A poll in 2000, conducted during negotiations toward a two-state solution, found that only 47 percent of Israelis and 10 percent of Palestinians supported a school curriculum that would educate students to “give up aspirations for parts of the ‘homeland’ which are in the other state.”\n\nThese stark statistics illustrate why the conflict has proved so intractable: Palestinians and Israelis subscribe to dueling national movements with deeply held and mutually exclusive historical and religious claims to the same land. After a century of violence and dispossession, it should not be surprising that many would happily wish the other side away, if such an option existed. The current American administration, though, is the first to reinforce those ambitions, rather than curtail them.\n\nAside from the efforts of beleaguered moderates, what restrains the region’s worst impulses is not principle, but practicality. Neither side can fully vanquish the other without unending bloodshed, and the international community has long refused to countenance an outcome in which one group simply routs the other. Instead, successive American presidents—with the notable exception of Donald Trump—have insisted that Israelis and Palestinians resolve their differences bilaterally at the negotiating table.\n\nEfforts to broker territorial compromise have repeatedly failed, but they had the effect of constraining maximalist aspirations on the ground. Consider the admission of Matan Kahana, a conservative Israeli politician: “If there was a sort of button you could push that would make all the Arabs disappear, sending them on an express train to Switzerland where they would live fantastic lives, I would press that button,” he told a student group in a right-wing settlement in 2022. “But what can you do? There is no such button. It therefore seems we were meant to coexist on this land in some way.” The comments leaked and Kahana was compelled to apologize, but the private recording revealed something interesting: Even a pro-settler lawmaker speaking to a sympathetic audience understood that the dream of ousting the other was unrealistic.\n\nThat began to change on October 7, 2023. Hamas, a Palestinian faction fanatically committed to ending Israel, massacred some 1,200 Israelis, and the Israeli far right saw an opportunity to attain its own thwarted ambitions. In 2005, Israel had forcibly removed all of its settlers from Gaza and ceded the Strip to Palestinian control. Eighteen years later, as Israel’s army reentered the area, the radicals in Benjamin Netanyahu’s government sought to turn back the clock—and to expel any Palestinians in their way.\n\n“The sole picture of victory in this war that will allow us to lift our heads,” the lawmaker Limor Son Har-Melech declared in late 2023, “is settlements across the entire Gaza Strip.” In November, Har-Melech and her allies spoke at a conference titled “Returning to the Gaza Strip” in Ashdod, a city between Tel Aviv and Gaza. Weeks later, more than 100 activists gathered in central Israel under the banner, “Practical Preparation for Settlement in Gaza.” In January 2024, 15 of the 64 members of Netanyahu’s governing coalition at the time attended an even larger gathering in Jerusalem, where speakers openly advocated the “voluntary migration” of Gazans—a euphemism for ethnic cleansing.\n\nPolls show that a clear majority of Israelis oppose the resettlement and annexation of Gaza. Even some Israelis who dream of one day ruling the entire land balk in practice at the notion of maintaining a perpetual military occupation against a Hamas insurgency. But Israel’s prime minister is beholden to the minority demanding exactly that. Netanyahu’s fragile coalition received just 48.4 percent of the vote in Israel’s last election, and relies on explicitly anti-Arab far-right factions to remain in power while Netanyahu is on trial for corruption. President Joe Biden understood this dynamic, and his administration undertook a public and private pressure campaign to prevent Netanyahu from acceding to his hard-right allies.\n\n“We have been clear, consistent, and unequivocal that Gaza is Palestinian land and will remain Palestinian land,” the State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said in a January 2024 statement, publicly rebuking two Netanyahu ministers for their “inflammatory and irresponsible” call to encourage “migration” from Gaza to make way for Jewish settlement.\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken flew to the region and assured America’s Arab allies that it opposed forced displacement. “Palestinian civilians must be able to return home as soon as conditions allow,” he said at a press conference in Doha, Qatar. “They cannot, they must not, be pressed to leave Gaza.” Blinken then traveled to Israel, where he apparently delivered the same message to Netanyahu. The next day, the Israeli leader posted a video in which he declared, “Israel has no intention of permanently occupying Gaza or displacing its civilian population.” A member of Netanyahu’s party told the press that the prime minister’s stance had shifted because of American pressure. For the moment, maximalism had been shoved back into the box.\n\nThen Donald Trump won reelection, and everything changed. The same day Trump defeated Kamala Harris, Netanyahu fired Yoav Gallant, his defense minister, who had opposed the resettlement of Gaza and publicly criticized the prime minister for refusing to commit to returning the territory to Palestinian control. In one fell swoop, the chief external (Biden) and internal (Gallant) obstacles to conquering Gaza were removed. The only pressure exerted on Netanyahu now was from the hard right. And then Trump himself seemingly joined its cause.\n\nOn February 4, sitting next to a surprised Netanyahu in the Oval Office, Trump dramatically undid all of Biden’s efforts, promising to take over Gaza, relocate its residents, and turn the area into the “Riviera of the Middle East.” The president may have conceived of this vision out of some misdirected sense of compassion, believing it would provide better lives for Palestinians now stuck in what he correctly termed a “demolition site.” But whatever Trump’s intentions, his proposal was immediately taken as affirmation of the maximalist dream of many Israelis, and an explicit warrant for ethnic cleansing by the Israeli far right. Once that prospect turned from a pipe dream into a president’s plan, it quickly became an obstruction to concluding the conflict.\n\nAt a press conference in May, Netanyahu declared that implementing Trump’s vision was now a condition for ending the war. Last week, the director of the Mossad reportedly visited Washington to discuss the “voluntary” relocation of “hundreds of thousands of Palestinians” to third-party countries. All the while, Gaza’s hunger crisis has dramatically worsened, while hostages continue to languish in Hamas dungeons. Far from expediting the conflict’s end, Trump’s proposal has been marshaled to prolong it. And as long as the president does not explicitly reject the goal of removing the Gazan population, it will continue to bedevil his plans for the region.\n\nThat’s because the maximalists are now driving events. Hamas, a messianic cult that never cared for the civilians it hid within and beneath, will happily continue fighting its unwinnable war against Israel to the last Gazan. Netanyahu will do whatever keeps his coalition in power, kowtowing to the far right and extending the war in service of their aims rather than winding it down. But this is not the outcome that Trump or his administration professes to want. The president has not raised his Riviera idea in months, and has instead begun pressuring Israel to compromise. “MAKE THE DEAL IN GAZA. GET THE HOSTAGES BACK!!!” Trump posted on Truth Social June 29.\n\n“The president’s message on this conflict in the Middle East, which has been going on for a long time and has become quite brutal—especially in Gaza—is clear,” Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday. “He wants the killing to end, to negotiate a cease-fire in this region, and he wants to see all of the hostages released from Gaza.” But the president’s message is not clear. It is contradictory, and that is the source of the problem.\n\nThis week, Trump dispatched his Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff overseas, amid hopes of clinching a deal. But if the administration wants more than another temporary cease-fire that will inevitably collapse, it needs to stop feeding the Israeli right’s dream of conquest—in Gaza, but also the West Bank. It must make clear that neither nation is going anywhere and once again confine the absolutist aspirations it unwisely unleashed.\n\nNetanyahu may want to placate the far right, but with his coalition falling apart and elections scheduled for 2026 in any event, he absolutely cannot afford to lose the American president before his next campaign. Whatever Trump dictates, as both Israel’s and Netanyahu’s primary patron, the prime minister will have to accept.\n\nA president’s words have power. With his Gaz-a-Lago intervention, Trump made attaining a lasting cease-fire in Gaza—not to mention broader peace in the Middle East—much harder. But by the same token, he has the capacity to reverse that reality, if he is willing to disown his biggest blunder.","summary":"Trump turned a far-right fantasy—ethnic cleansing in Gaza—into U.S. policy.

According to a statement by the New Hampshire Department of Justice, Naseef Bryan, who was living in Manchester, New Hampshire, was arrested and is being charged with three counts of wrongful voting. He allegedly knowingly illegally voted in a local Manchester election in 2023 as well as the 2024 presidential primary and general. If convicted, he is facing between three and a half and seven years in New Hampshire State Prison and a fine of up to $4,000.

The outlet reported that Bryan has a lengthy history of filing over a dozen lawsuits against an array of government agencies and individuals, including a local police department, a community college in Concord and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Bryan has previously sued USCIS twice though, according to the outlet, his grievances are unclear due to the filings being \"ambiguous and contain[ing] long stretches of writing about disparate topics.\" NHPR wrote that in one filing against USCIS, Bryan references maritime law and requests relief in the form of gold coins. TRUMP DEMANDS SPECIAL PROSECUTOR INVESTIGATE 'STOLEN' 2020 ELECTION, LOSS TO BIDEN A Republican-backed law passed in 2024 requires anyone registering to vote in New Hampshire to present proof of U.S. citizenship. Though the voting bill was signed into law in September, it did not take effect until days after the 2024 presidential election, according to the New Hampshire Bulletin. Former Vice President Kamala Harris narrowly won the state of New Hampshire’s four electoral college votes over President Donald Trump in a 50% to 48% vote. Republicans, however, have controlled the governor's office and both chambers of the state legislature since 2021. Bryan's arrest comes as concerns over noncitizens illegally voting are growing across the country. In Texas, state Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, recently launched an investigation into more than 100 potential noncitizens who allegedly cast at least 200 ballots in the 2020 and 2022 election cycles.

Numerous Democrats and liberal pundits claimed that Paramount’s decision to cancel Colbert, a fanatical critic of President Donald Trump, was purely political, an attempt to curry favor with the president and boost their chances of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approving a billion-dollar merger with Skydance Media. (Subscribe to MR. RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\nWhy? Colbert slammed his own employer and described their recent settlement with Trump over Kamala Harris’ edited “60 Minutes” interview as a “big, fat bribe.”\n\nThe timing seemed dubious to Democrats, and of course, some of them took it way too far. Case in point: Democratic Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who claimed that Colbert’s firing marked the beginning of a fascist censorship state.\n\n If you refuse to see what is happening, the cancellation of the Colbert show should open your eyes.

No one is ever safe from its creators, Trey Parker and Matt Stone. They never have, and never will, carry water for any celebrity political movement, or humanitarian cause. They’ve been cooking since the late 90s, yet always remain funny and relevant, unlike Colbert.\n\nSouth Park mocked Trump during his first term, and they mocked him again Wednesday night in the season 27 premiere. The show actually went further with Trump than it has before, dragging him for the Epstein files debacle and depicting him in a gay relationship with their Satan character.\n\n NEW: South Park targets President Trump over the Epstein files in their new episode, puts him in bed with Satan.

This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history — and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak.”\n\nAll of it gets you thinking …\n\nIf Paramount was afraid of the Trump administration tanking their merger, and sacrificed Colbert to placate the White House, why in the world would they strike a $1.5 billion streaming deal with Parker and Stone? Would they risk pissing off the Trump administration, knowing full well that South Park is a fearless show that takes no prisoners?\n\nWell, South Park is worth the money and isn’t getting cancelled anytime soon. Keeping Colbert on the payroll? Not so much.\n\nColbert was a complete money drain. The show cost $100 million to make per season, but only raked in $60 million in return, according to Puck News. Reuters also reported that the show was burning $40 million a year and his audience was shrinking.\n\nAs for the liberals who will inevitably believe the great Colbert Conspiracy, no matter how many times you repeat that he was reportedly costing the network $40 million a year: you can’t call America a censorship state when another show on that same network is allowed to depict its supposedly fascist dictator with a tiny wiener, sleeping with Satan.\n\nSign up for John Loftus’s weekly newsletter here!

King made the claims based on the cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s The Late Show, which is leading to different reactions on social media.In a video shared through her self-titled YouTube channel on July 23, 2025, the online personality stated that the rumors of the cancellation of The View had been ongoing since 2024. Melanie said that it had been circulating for different reasons, including a decline in ratings and criticism towards the hosts.“All day long, they rail against conservatives or Republicans or anyone that doesn’t align with their talking points. Social media is exploding with posts like, about time ABC acts as that bias trash heap or Whoopi and Joey are relics. Cancel them already. And guess what? The truth is ABC should pull the plug”, King added.Melanie King stated that she would not accept that the ABC production was the “number one daytime talk show.” The YouTube star mentioned that controversies always led to an increase in viewership and that it had reportedly reduced in the last three years.Melanie referred to the cancellation of The Late Show, saying that ABC should now suit, and adding:“Relics like The View are not safe and they shouldn’t be. And speaking of Paramount and CBS, the cancellation of The Late Show with Stephen Colbert that’s going to take place in May of next year, is the blueprint for what needs to happen with The View.”Melanie King says that no one is interested in listening to the hosts of The ViewMelanie King’s latest video featured her saying that the ABC show has changed a lot ever since it premiered back in 1997. She said that it was initially intended to be a platform for “diverse women’s perspectives” and over the years, the focus shifted to other topics.Melanie referred to the problems allegedly associated with The View and addressed the hosts by saying:“They defend radical policies and ignore real issues. Critics are right. It’s an echo chamber of liberal shields beholden to Democratic Elite just like Colbert was.” View this post on Instagram Instagram PostThe 44-year-old stated that the hosts of The View were not supporting free speech. Apart from that, she referred to how CBS cancelled The Late Show for alleged financial issues, saying that ABC can also consider having a second thought about The View continuing for more seasons since the situation was almost the same.Melanie mentioned that almost all the late-night shows had been facing the problem of declining viewership, describing them as “political shields.” Melanie claimed that critics were reportedly saying that the ABC show’s cancellation was “overdue” and that Reddit threads were also speaking about the same.“Users cite their very low ratings and their bias. Again, the only times they have good ratings is when there’s a spike in views from a special guest, and especially during the election cycle when they would have on Joe Biden or Kamala Harris, then they would get a boost. Otherwise, no one wants to hear what these ladies have to say, and they’re getting tuned out on a daily basis,” she said.Melanie said that although the talk show was being watched by millions, people didn’t like it at the same time for certain reasons. She further stated that cost-cutting have been a priority for all shows that are getting cancelled in 2025.As per an update shared by TV Insider on July 24, 2025, Joy Behar announced in an episode of The View, which aired the same day, that they were going on a hiatus. An insider for the outlet stated that the hiatus will be a part of a summer break, which starts in August and ends after Labor Day.The View has aired for 28 seasons so far.

He died surrounded by loved ones, manager Chris Volo told NBC Los Angeles. Hogan, whose real name was Terry Gene Bollea, reached pop culture icon status during his wrestling heyday in the 1980s. His high-octane stage presence helped propel pro wrestling to the mainstream. He was best known for his work with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Hogan saw his seemingly universal popularity shrink in recent years over controversies related to allegations of racism and his support for Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. He launched an ultimately successful libel lawsuit against former website Gawker over a leaked sex tape — a suit that unearthed audio of Hogan describing himself as a “racist, to a point” and using the N-word while criticizing his daughter’s relationship with a Black man. (He later apologized for the remarks.) In the following years, he lent his name and likeness to Trump’s political movement, most recently backing him in a speech at last year’s Republican National Convention. He also faced backlash for delivering a racist diatribe attacking Kamala Harris last August. This is a developing story.

Who was that again? That was not Obama,\" Behar said to applause from the studio audience.Behar continued to ridicule Trump, saying he is \"so jealous of Obama\" because Obama is \"trim, smart, handsome\" and \"can sing,\" all things Behar said Trump is not. Another host chimed in to say that Obama is \"happily married,\" suggesting Trump is not.The White House then called for the show to be \"pulled off the air\" in a statement to Entertainment Weekly, claiming the show has \"hit the lowest ratings\" recently.\"Joy Behar is an irrelevant loser suffering from a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome,\" White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers told the outlet.This prompted Fox News to ask FCC Chair Brendan Carr if \"The View\" could be facing \"the crosshairs\" of the Trump administration during a Thursday morning interview.\"It's entirely possible that there's issues over there,\" Carr said. \"Once President Trump has exposed these media gatekeepers and smashed this facade, there's a lot of consequences. I think the consequences aren't quite finished.\"The FCC chair's statement comes after CBS agreed to pay $16 million to settle a lawsuit with Trump over the \"60 minutes\" episode with former Vice President Kamala Harris. Days after late night host Stephen Colbert criticized the deal, CBS' parent company Paramount canceled \"The Late Show\" hosted by Colbert.While \"The View\" is under the ABC network, the hosts have bashed the president in the past, challenging Democratic lawmakers to do more against Trump and praising rapper Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl halftime performance, saying he did not \"capitulate to Trump\" amid the administration's anti-DEI efforts.Originally published on Latin Times","summary":"The FCC chair appeared to back the White House's threat to cancel \"The View\" after the show's hosts mocked Donald Trump's recent targeting of Barack Obama.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com/fcc-chair-backs-white-house-threat-cancel-view-after-hosts-rip-trump-consequences-arent-3779358","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com/en/full/4612626/joy-behar-view-donald-trump.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=afd3a32ff05aae358df6526e78204d6b","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 16:51:17","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.263},{"id":344975668,"title":"South Park targets Paramount after signing $1.5bn deal and skewers Trump: ‘He can do anything to anyone’","text":"South Park has kicked off its 27th season with a blistering episode taking aim at Donald Trump and its newly minted parent company, Paramount, just one day after signing a $1.5bn deal with the network.\n\nThe premiere episode, Sermon on the Mount, sees the US president in bed with series regular Satan and covers topics including Trump’s lawsuit against Paramount, the cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, wokeness, Trump’s attacks on Canada and more.\n\nUnlike other characters, Trump is depicted as an actual photo of the US president on an animated body. There is also an extended scene featuring a hyper-realistic, deepfake video of Trump, completely naked, walking in a desert. There are repeated suggestions that Trump’s genitalia are small.\n\nThe episode centers on the presence of Jesus in South Park’s schools, a story covered by a parody of 60 Minutes, in a clear satire of Paramount’s recent embroilment with Trump over the flagship CBS News show. The two hosts refer nervously to “the president, who is a great man” and who “is probably watching”.\n\nWhen South Park’s parents protest to Trump that they don’t want Jesus in schools, and Trump threatens to sue them for $5bn, Jesus begs them to settle with the president. “I didn’t want to come back and be in the school, but I had to because it was part of a lawsuit and the agreement with Paramount,” Jesus says through gritted teeth.\n\n“You guys saw what happened to CBS? Well, guess who owns CBS? Paramount. You really want to end up like Colbert? You guys got to stop being stupid … He also has the power to sue and take bribes and he can do anything to anyone. It’s the fucking president, dude … South Park is over.”\n\nThe townspeople eventually agree to pay Trump a much smaller $3.5m, but also must create “pro-Trump messaging” – leading to the aforementioned video of Trump wandering in a desert, stripping naked.\n\nOn Wednesday, the companies South Park Digital Studios and Park County, which are run by South Park’s creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, announced a licensing deal with Paramount+ Global. The $1.5bn (£1.1bn) agreement confirms 50 new episodes on Comedy Central over five years, to exclusively stream on Paramount+ worldwide. The entire South Park library will also be made available on Paramount+ in the US.\n\nDylan Byers, a senior correspondent at the media organization Puck, wrote on social media after the episode’s release: “Hard to think of anything more defiant in media & entertainment recently than Trey Parker & Matt Stone going scorched earth on Paramount in a South Park season premiere on the heels of netting a $1.5 billion deal with the very same company.”\n\nThis deal also comes after recent contentious disputes involving Paramount. Skydance, which is controlled by the son of Trump ally Larry Ellison, is vying to take over Paramount Global, as well as Park Country. (Early this month Parker and Stone criticised the merger for postponing the season 27 premiere, writing: “This merger is a shitshow and it’s fucking up South Park. We are at the studio working on new episodes, and we hope the fans get to see them somehow.”)\n\nThe merger, however, requires the approval from the Trump-controlled Federal Communications Commission. When Paramount controversially settled a lawsuit with Trump for $16m over allegations that CBS News, which is owned by Paramount, committed “election interference” in its editing of a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris, some critics alleged another example of capitulation by media companies hoping to curry favor with the US president.\n\nThen three days after Colbert, a high-profile critic of Trump, branded the deal “a big fat bribe” on his late-night CBS show, Paramount and CBS announced it had cancelled the show.\n\nThe South Park premiere alludes constantly to the events, with Cartman learning that his favorite radio show on NPR – where “liberals bitch and whine about stuff” – has been cancelled by Trump. “The government can’t cancel the show. I mean, what show are they going to cancel next?” he says.\n\nTrump’s character is also asked directly by Satan about the “Epstein list”, referring to the unreleased files held by the US government relating to the convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein, who was friends with Trump for 15 years. A political firestorm has erupted since the Trump administration’s recent decision not to release any more documents.\n\nSatan asks Trump directly if he’s on the Epstein list. “It’s weird that whenever it comes up, you just tell everyone to relax,” Satan says.\n\nThe Guardian has contacted Stone, Parker and the White House for comment.\n\nIn a statement to Variety, a White House spokesperson, Taylor Rogers, lambasted the “Left” and criticised the show for its lack of “authentic or original content”.\n\n“This show hasn’t been relevant for over 20 years and is hanging on by a thread with uninspired ideas in a desperate attempt for attention. President Trump has delivered on more promises in just six months than any other president in our country’s history – and no fourth-rate show can derail President Trump’s hot streak,” the statement continued.","summary":"Show begins 27th season covering Trump’s lawsuit against Paramount and cancellation of Stephen Colbert’s show, depicting Trump in bed with Satan\n\nSouth Park has kicked off its 27th season with a blistering episode taking aim at Donald Trump and its newly minted parent company, Paramount, just one day after signing a $1.5bn deal with the network.\n\nThe premiere episode, Sermon on the Mount, sees the US president in bed with series regular Satan and covers topics including Trump’s lawsuit against Paramount, the cancellation of The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, wokeness, Trump’s attacks on Canada and more.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2025/jul/24/south-park-trump-paramount","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e939259a3c6cba3708dcc0ce663c626d066dd27b/659_0_2672_2138/master/2672.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-07-24 16:49:57","author":"Jenna Amatulli","authors":["Jenna Amatulli"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.079}]}
