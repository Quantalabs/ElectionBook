'None of this is taxpayer money, this is an FEC filing. Be loud and wrong about something else. Try again next time.'\n\nThe 35-year-old politician reportedly made a payment of $3,700 to a 'Juan D Gonzalez' and another for $850 to 'Bombazo Dance Co Inc.,' using her MRA allowance - which is meant to support official congressional duties.\n\nBoth expenditures were described as being used for 'training' by the progressive politician.\n\nThe NLPC's Tuesday filing argues that such expenditures are in violation of the intended use of the MRA.\n\nThe filing states that Ocasio-Cortez's 'assertion that these expenses are \"an FEC filing,\"' separate from her MRA – as well as her claim that \"[n]one of this is taxpayer money\" – is both troubling and obviously incorrect.'\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 35, issued a scathing response to allegations that she misused taxpayer funds for questionable expenses, including payments to a dance company\n\nThe complaint, filed by the National Legal and Policy Center on Tuesday, claims that the US Representative's office improperly allocated funds from her taxpayer-funded Members' Representational Allowance - which is meant to support official congressional duties -to cover costs associated with the dance troupe\n\n'Either she does not know the difference between her campaign funds and MRA, or, more likely, she knows the highlighted expenses were not for official business and should have been paid by her campaign and reported to the FEC,' the claim reads.\n\nExecutive director of Americans for Public Trust, Caitlin Sutherland, reacted to the claim asking for an investigation into the congresswoman. \n\n'Representative Ocasio-Cortez’s troubling payments from her taxpayer funded account for activities such as dance classes should be investigated,' Sutherland wrote in a statement to FoxNews Digital.\n\nThe group's Executive Director Caitlin Sutherland added the expenses appear to insult hard-working American taxpayers. \n\n'Representative Ocasio-Cortez’s troubling payments from her taxpayer funded account for activities such as dance classes should be investigated. \n\n'In the era of reining in government spending, the American people deserve to know lawmakers are being good stewards of their tax dollars,' she added.\n\nYet, Ocasio-Cortez stood firm on her claim that all expenditures were legitimate and within the guidelines of congressional spending.\n\nThe outspoken politician has faced ethics complaints in the past, including from the Heritage Foundation in 2023 accusing her of 'falsely accusing' and 'defaming' the creator of the Libs of TikTok Twitter account, Chaya Raichik.\n\nShe also faced another ethics probe in 2023 after she allegedly accepted free tickets to the Met Gala valued around $35,000. She notably wore a dress to that event which read 'tax the rich.'\n\nThe congresswoman has since denied any wrongdoing, taking to social media to claim that the government watchdog agency is '100% wrong'\n\nIn other recent news, Ocasio-Cortez announced plans to take Democratic resistance on the road, appearing in GOP-held congressional districts in Pennsylvania and New York in coming weeks.\n\nThe congresswoman divulged her plans to the Associated Press for a story on Monday, after fellow progressive, Sen. Bernie Sanders, attracted big crowds in Warren, Michigan on Saturday, for a stop on his 'Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here' tour.\n\nThe New York Democrat said she would be joining Sanders on the road soon and also be doing the solo appearances.\n\n'You look around - who else is doing it? No one,' Ocasio-Cortez said. 'My hope is that the dam wil break in terms of Democrats going on the offense ... We need to take the argument directly to the people.'\n\nOn Saturday, more than 6,000 people were packed into three different auditoriums for Sanders' joint appearance with United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain.\n\nSanders said he was targeting Congressional districts that narrowly went to President Donald Trump, like Warren, a Detroit suburb.\n\nThe Vermont independent also made stops in Altoona and Kenosha, Wisconsin.\n\nHe's using the push to encourage swing members of Congress to vote against a funding bill that slahes Medicaid, food stamps and other social programs.\n\nMichigan and Wisconsin - and also Pennsylvania, where she plans to travel - have been the most important swing states in modern politics.\n\nOcasio-Cortez told the Associated Press she planned to visit GOP-controlled districts in Pennsylvania and New York, emulating progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has taken his message on the road in recent weeks \n\nSen. Bernie Sanders is conducting a 'Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here' tour in areas that narrowly went to President Donald Trump. Over the weekend he made appearances in Wisconsin and in Warren, Michigan (pictured) \n\nThey make up the three 'blue wall' states that went to Trump in the 2016 election - states Biden won back four years later.\n\nThey again swung to Trump in 2024, when he defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAnd while New York leans Democratic at the presidential level, it could help Democrats win back the House in 2026 with its handful of swing districts.\n\nSince Democrats have found themselves booted from the White House and in the minority in both the House and Senate, party leaders have struggled to find their footing.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats responded to Trump's joint address before Congress by holding up signs, wearing pink and protesting.\n\nEven members of their own party found their actions to be performative.\n\n'Why are democrats just sitting there? The signs are not landing. It is giving bingo! Sigh,' said MSNBC host Symone Sanders, who was Bernie Sanders' 2016 press secretary before going to work for Joe Biden's 2020 campaign.\n\nBernie Sanders had kicked off his Fighting Oligarchy: Where We Go From Here' in February, first traveling to Omaha, Nebraska and Iowa City, Iowa, before this weekend's trip to Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n'It's not about whether Bernie should or shouldn't be doing this. It's about that we all should,' Ocasio-Cortez told the AP.\n\nShe noted that Sanders - who came up short in his 2016 and 2020 runs for the Democratic nomination after being thwarted by more moderate candidates - holds a distinct position in American politics.\n\n'He is unique in this country, and so long as we are blessed to have that capacity on our side, I think we should be thankful for it,' the Democratic politician said of Sanders.\n\nDemocratsNew YorkMichiganBernie Sanders\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nAOC's stinging response as she's accused of misusing taxpayer-funded allowance for 'troubling expenses'\n\nAdd comment","summary":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez issued a scathing response to allegations that she misused taxpayer funds for questionable expenses, including payments to a dance company.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14488327/aoc-misusing-taxpayer-allowance-troubling-expenses.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/12/00/96091831-0-image-m-14_1741739299940.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/02/22/2187211418702988582/1024x576_MP4_2187211418702988582.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-12 00:55:17","author":"Editor,Samantha Rutt","authors":["Editor","Samantha Rutt"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.619},{"id":299200286,"title":"John P. Ruehl: Trump’s Address to Congress Highlights the Absence of Opposition","text":"By John P. Ruehl\n\nAuthor Bio: John P. Ruehl is an Australian-American journalist living in Washington, D.C., and a world affairs correspondent for the Independent Media Institute. He is a contributor to several foreign affairs publications, and his book, Budget Superpower: How Russia Challenges the West With an Economy Smaller Than Texas’, was published in December 2022.\n\nCredit Line: This article was produced by Economy for All, a project of the Independent Media Institute.\n\nDuring his address to Congress on March 4, 2025, U.S. President Donald Trump faced brief heckling from Democratic Representative AI Green and scattered jeers from his colleagues. But the overwhelming response was silence, reflective of the reality that opposition to Trump has sharply weakened, even as his administration pushes sweeping domestic and international policy upheaval.\n\nThe opening weeks of his first term in January 2017 were met with fierce resistance, and not just from combative Democrats. People came together to protest against Trump’s immigration policies and his proposed travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. Republican politicians openly defied him amid constant media scrutiny. Clashes with the so-called “deep state” due to intelligence leaks escalated when the FBI publicly confirmed an investigation into the Trump-Russia collusion in the 2016 election. These combined tensions defined his first term, culminating in him being temporarily banned from most major social media platforms and leading to widespread condemnation and isolation after the January 6, 2021, Capitol attack.\n\nNow, at the start of his second term, opposition is notably subdued. The Women’s March that drew millions in 2017, becoming “the largest single-day public demonstration in U.S. history,” according to the New York Times, seems to have “lost its luster” during his second term. The February 5 protest against Trump and Elon Musk’s policies drew a low turnout, mostly confined to liberal enclaves, and the 2025 Oscars—once a stage for political grandstanding—avoided directly critiquing the president. Even Green’s disruption caused dissent within his own party, with 10 Democrats censuring him the next day.\n\nPolitical and institutional fatigue, shifting cultural dynamics, and strategic alignment by corporations, billionaires, politicians, and other public figures have blunted resistance, leaving the Trump administration with fewer obstacles as it pushes forward with its agenda.\n\nOne major factor is the weakness and division within the Democratic Party, preventing grassroots progressives from working with top-level establishment Democrats. After years of Biden attempting to balance the party’s competing factions, tensions rose significantly following his response to the October 7, 2023, attack on Israel by Hamas. Trump’s victory a year later—securing both the electoral college and popular vote—has only deepened these fractures, fueling a blame game that contrasts with the unity following Trump’s narrower 2016 election victory.\n\nThe party’s electoral failures are compounded by the absence of a unifying figure. Nancy Pelosi is no longer speaker, and while Chuck Schumer is the Senate minority leader, both of them are old and unpopular. Bernie Sanders, who is in his 80s, represents a sidelined progressive movement that has struggled to elevate new, dynamic leaders due to years of suppression by establishment Democrats. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries has failed to offer new solutions, only deepening apathy and fatigue.\n\nWithout organizational cohesion and the ability to inspire its base, the Democratic Party has been unable to marshal its diverse coalition against Trump’s agenda. The issue that has mobilized progressives in large numbers in recent years is Palestine, which establishment Democrats are reluctant to support, including the recent arrest and threatened deportation of pro-Palestinian student Mahmoud Khalil. Losing young male voters has further weakened the party’s ability to generate active dissent.\n\nIts association with progressive identity politics has meanwhile alienated broader segments of the electorate, with Biden having failed to address glaring economic issues and matters like crime and immigration during his presidency.\n\nOn the Republican side, dissenting voices like Mitt Romney and the late John McCain are gone, and those who still might challenge Trump within the party fear backlash and isolation. “Never Trump” conservative groups have struggled to pull voters away, while Trump’s systemic dismantling of government bureaucracy (historically staffed with left-leaning officials) and the appointment of loyalists to key positions have cemented his control over the government and prevented institutional attempts to undermine him.\n\nWith Republican control over all three branches of government, a conservative-majority Supreme Court, and Trump loyalists installed across federal agencies, his power—though often overstated—far surpasses that of his first term. Executive orders, constrained by previous presidents, are now being deployed at an unprecedented rate. His administration’s ambitious federal restructuring efforts, tied to the Project 2025 framework, go beyond the government overhauls of Ronald Reagan’s Grace Commission or Bill Clinton’s bipartisan National Performance Review. Yet, Democratic disarray has left these efforts largely unchecked.\n\nTrump’s progress also hinges on the support of the ultrawealthy. The Democratic Party is experiencing a funding shortfall, not just from grassroots donors but from major oligarchs as well. Meanwhile, Trump has secured broader public backing from America’s corporate elite. Years of frustration with Democrats and the political left over issues like diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, taxation, and regulationshave pushed many business leaders toward his camp.\n\nThis repositioning was on full display at Trump’s inauguration, where Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Google CEO Sundar Pichai, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, and many more wealthy individuals were given front-row seats. Google’s decision to rename the Gulf of Mexico to the “Gulf of America,” a Trump executive order, signals the larger realignment across corporate America.\n\nNo billionaire has played a more consequential role than Elon Musk. Though his relationship with Trump was rocky just a few years ago, Musk’s endorsement of Trump in July 2024 cemented a powerful alliance between them. Musk’s control of X (formerly Twitter) not only reintroduced Trump to the media platform but also helped normalize his return to other social media networks. Meanwhile, Democrats have struggled to maintain their online presence amid declining engagement and financial strain.\n\nThis realignment has extended into the corporate media landscape. The aggressive anti-Trump narratives that dominated his first term have softened, driven by audience backlash against media institutions and wider progressive messaging. With traditional media outlets facing declining viewership, and the growing influence of oligarchic forces now backing Trump, the media’s pivot is as much about survival as it is about political recalibration.\n\nSigns of this emerged even before the election. Jeff Bezos, who has owned the Washington Post since 2013, withdrew the paper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris, as did billionaire Patrick Soon-Shiong, owner of the Los Angeles Times. CNN, under new leadership since 2023, has steadily adopted a more centrist tone, shedding high-profile anti-Trump figures like Don Lemon. MSNBC is undergoing an even more dramatic transformation, with outspoken Trump critics like Joy Reid and Alex Wagner losing their primetime slots in February 2025, while there has been scaling back of influence of others like Rachel Maddow in favor of less combative voices.\n\nEmboldened by a changing media environment, Trump is increasingly punishing outlets. The Associated Press was banned from presidential events in February after declining to adopt the “Gulf of America” name. CBS remains embroiled in a $20 billion lawsuit filed by Trump over an edited interview with Kamala Harris, with Musk declaring that CBS reporters “deserve a long prison sentence.”\n\nMeanwhile, Disney-ABC settled a defamation lawsuit with Trump for $15 million and recently replaced a transgender character from a new series with a Christian one. Meta, too, in January 2025, settled for $25 million for banning Trump from Facebook and Instagram after January 6. While these are small fines for corporate giants, they symbolize an increasing subservience to Trump, with both payments directed toward funding Trump’s presidential library.\n\nIt’s hardly surprising that Trump appears so powerful at this moment. Political opposition is fractured, leaving no effective barriers to Trump’s agenda. Many oligarchs have given him their quiet or public approval, as seen during his inauguration. The media’s softened stance has shaped a perception of reduced conflict. The absence of strong opposition has created new momentum as political, corporate, and media institutions adapt to this shifting power balance instead of fighting it, reducing the public’s appetite for resistance as well. For now, Trump is riding high after his election victory.\n\nBut cracks are beginning to show. Public resistance to Musk’s influence is growing, and the economic turbulence triggered by Trump’s policies is stirring unease. Without a strong and combative adversary, Trump and his most ardent supporters may find themselves without a rallying cause. International stability could further test his power, and the reality of governance may prove far more challenging than dismantling what came before.\n\nIs this already the peak of Trump’s power, or can it be sustained? Opposition to Trump fluctuated during his first term, yet today, the political, business, and culturallandscapes have adjusted in his favor. His greatest advantage, however, may be the quiet acquiescence of elites from various backgrounds. While some may oppose him openly, many are content to let events play out due to self-interest or inertia.","summary":"The relentless resistance that defined Trump’s first term has faded into an unsettling quiet.

Why? To protest Trump taking over the board. \n\nThe Backstory\n\nBased on the life of Founding Father Alexander Hamilton, the musical from the unquestionably gifted Lin-Manuel Miranda became an instant American musical theater classic when it burst onto Broadway in 2015. Blending hip-hop, R&B, pop, and good old-fashioned show tunes, and recasting America’s Founders in all manner of races and creeds, Hamilton celebrates America’s origin story in a vibrant, impactful way.\n\nSo far, so good. However, weeks after the 2016 election, the Broadway cast chose to dress down Vice President-elect Mike Pence when he came to enjoy the show. Partisan politics trumped performing. The message heard by Trump voters? You are not welcome at Hamilton.\n\nHeck, given his views on immigration, Alexander Hamilton himself would not be welcomed.\n\nHamilton Runs From the Kennedy Center\n\nYou’d think by now Hamilton’s producers would be over it. After all, Trump’s 2024 overwhelming victory came with a broad coalition as racially and ethnically diverse as the Hamilton cast. Plus, Hamilton’s 2026 appearance was to be part of the nation’s 250th anniversary celebration. In other words, the run was about “We the People” honoring the Founding Fathers. Not the Orange Man.\n\nYes, Trump wants to revive the Kennedy Center, which the federal government maintains. The venue was deep in the red and deep into the woke. Drag queen workshops for District of Columbia area teens? “Oh God, a Show About Abortion”? Really? The president replaced the board and made Ric Grenell interim executive director.\n\n“We just want an arts center that celebrates the arts,” Grenell told Fox News Thursday, “We want commonsense art.” At the Conservative Political Action Conference Grenell said, “We have to do the big productions that the masses and the public want to see, we want to have really good programming.”\n\n“Hamilton” is perfectly consistent with that vision.\n\nHowever, Miranda and company decided to take their period costumes and run off stage left.\n\n“This latest action by Trump means it’s not the Kennedy Center as we knew it,” Miranda told The New York Times. “The Kennedy Center was not created in this spirit, and we’re not going to be a part of it while it is the Trump Kennedy Center.”\n\nProducer Jeffrey Seller claimed the “purge” of staff and events “flies in the face of everything a national cultural center represents.”\n\nExcept it can’t be a national cultural center if it does not align with the values of the nation.\n\nHe insisted the Kennedy Center was “never about politics.” Except in 2017 when the Kennedy Center board sat on its well-manicured hands when several of those given Kennedy Center Honors said they’d boycott the event if Trump hosted, as was tradition.\n\nNoting “Hamilton” appeared at the Kennedy Center during Trump’s first term, Seller said, “We are not acting against his administration, but against the partisan policies of the Kennedy Center as a result of his recent takeover.”\n\nWhat partisan policies? Grenell insists the only shows cut thus far were because the show itself pulled out or sales were weak.\n\nSeller added he canceled now out of fear the new leadership would cancel the production. However, according to Grenell, they never bothered to ask if it would be.\n\nSeller and [Manuel] first went to The New York Times before they came to the Kennedy Center with their announcement that they can’t be in the same room with Republicans.\n\nThis is a publicity stunt that will backfire.\n\nThe arts are for everyone—not just for the people who Lin likes and agrees with.\n\nWho’s Getting Hurt?\n\nFirst, the irony. Hamilton’s punishing theatergoers in a city that went 90% for Kamala Harris. And they call Miranda a genius?\n\nSecond, MAGA voters angered at the Pence slight since 2016 would now be more willing to check “Hamilton” out. Bailing denies the show a potential new audience and reaffirms the belief supporters of Trump are not welcome. Producers are hurting themselves.\n\nThird, they are hurting what they profess to love: the performing arts.\n\nThey have again put their own partisan politics ahead of performing for the people. They are saying theater—in particular, the Kennedy Center—must be in the hands of those of a singular political persuasion and vision for art, that the venue must be renamed The Kennedy Center for the Liberal Performers and Creators. What a shot to the heart of the spirit of theater. (Or abdomen, in Hamilton’s case.)\n\nSure. Miranda has the right to stage his show anywhere he wants. No problem. Do a revival of “1776” in its place. Catchier songs, more accurate history, happier ending. Plus, you can cast it with performers dying to give their all to an audience every night regardless of who they voted for, rather than performers more eager to check our party affiliation at the door than our ticket.\n\nTheater isn’t about the board. It’s about what happens on the boards and the audience there to experience it. This is a history lesson “Hamilton’s” creator has forgotten.","summary":"Lost in the kerfuffle over the Democrats’ contemptible behavior during President Donald Trump’s address to Congress was a further example of the Left’s disconnect and...

The audience also sang along.\n\nAs Underwood exited, she shook hands with Vice President JD Vance, 40, and President Trump, 78.\n\nUnderwood previously told The Post, “I love our country and am honored to have been asked to sing at the Inauguration and to be a small part of this historic event. I am humbled to answer the call at a time when we must all come together in the spirit of unity and looking to the future.”\n\nSome fans initially criticized Underwood’s choice to perform. Whoopi Goldberg, meanwhile, publicly defended the “American Idol” alum.\n\n“I stand behind her,” she said on “The View.” \n\n“If I believe I have the right to make up my mind to go perform someplace, I believe they have the same right. So I have to support [her],” she continued. “It doesn’t mean I’m particularly interested in watching. I won’t be watching. But that’s me.”\n\nHowever, not all of Goldberg’s co-hosts agreed with the 69-year-old’s sentiments. Joy Behar said that she would “not normalize” Trump by singing at his inauguration.\n\nChastising Underwood’s statement, Behar, 82 added: “How do you love your country and support and normalize somebody who was a convicted felon, who really wants to destroy the country, in my opinion?” \n\nThe long-standing host later clarified her thoughts, explaining that she would “not be the person” to tell someone not to perform at the inauguration because she believes “in free speech.”\n\nBefore welcoming her second child, the reality star vet got candid on navigating her work/life balance.\n\n“I remember when we first found out we were gonna have him [Isaiah], it [was] like, ‘How are we gonna do this? Our lives are so crazy as it is,'” she recounted to People in 2017. “But you just make room, and you learn how important that family time is, and to be able to spend time and carve out some of that and maybe get to go on vacation and maybe get to go on a cruise — that stuff is so important to, like I said, make time for family. That’s what it’s all about.”\n\nThree years later, Underwood basked in spending quality time with her sons during the COVID-19 pandemic. (The singer shares sons Isaiah, 9, and Jacob, 5, with husband Mike Fisher.)\n\n“I’ve never been in one place for this long in the past 15-plus years of my career,” she told “Today” at the time. “So it’s been really great to just really get to know them and watch them grow — especially Jake. It’s such a critical time in his life and I’m never gonna get it back. So we’re just trying to enjoy it.”","summary":"“She held her own, and she remained cool, calm and collected,\" the showrunner noted of Underwood's technical mishap.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/11/entertainment/american-idol-showrunner-defends-carrie-underwoods-inauguration-performance/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/01/carrie-underwood-performs-hp-2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1737384307&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/K7gWWJfz-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-11 23:10:39","author":"Alexandra Bellusci,Whitney Vasquez","authors":["Alexandra Bellusci","Whitney Vasquez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.434},{"id":299182014,"title":"California has never elected a female governor, but Katie Porter’s entry to 2026 race raises the odds","text":"Former California Congresswoman Katie Porter, a progressive Democrat who gained fame on social media for her fiery take-downs of Republicans and corporate executives, raised the odds that California will elect its first female governor with her Tuesday announcement that she is running to replace Gavin Newsom as governor in 2026.\n\nPorter’s announcement shakes up what could be a historic race for governor. Of at least six other Democrats and one Republican who have officially entered the field, Porter is the most prominent name, fresh off a statewide U.S. Senate campaign that she lost to fellow Democrat Adam Schiff — but in which she raised an impressive $32 million.\n\n“She’s a force,” said San Jose State University political science professor emeritus Larry Gerston. “There’s no other way to look at it.”\n\nBut the field still remains in question amid speculation around former Vice President and Oakland native Kamala Harris, who will reportedly make her decision on whether to join the governor’s race by summer’s end.\n\nEarly polling has shown Porter leading the pack of candidates — if Harris doesn’t run. If the ex-Vice President does jump into the race, Porter has signaled she’ll exit.\n\nGerston and other political analysts say Porter is a strong candidate who could mount a serious campaign. Beyond her significant name recognition and ability to fundraise vast sums, Porter’s candidacy makes it even more likely that voters could elect the first female governor in California history.\n\nOn the Democratic side of the race, former state Sen. Toni Atkins, Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis and former state controller Betty Yee — all women — also are vying to break California’s glass ceiling.\n\nThe Golden State is one of 18 states nationally that have never elected a female governor, said David McCuan, professor of political science at Sonoma State University. He said Kounalakis and Porter are particularly competitive candidates who could change that — along with Harris, should she decide to run.\n\nThe field is evenly split between men and women so far.\n\nFour men have officially declared their candidacies so far. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, entrepreneur Stephen Cloobeck and state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond, all Democrats, have entered the race. So has Republican Chad Bianco, the current sheriff of Riverside County. After years of hints and speculation that he would run, Democratic Attorney General Rob Bonta bowed out of the race last month.\n\nThe race is “very crowded for female candidates,” Gerston said, but he believes Porter picked the right time to run.\n\nPorter led the field of declared and potential candidates in a Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies poll in November, with 13%, nearly twice the 7% support for the next highest Democrats, Kounalakis and Villaraigosa. That field didn’t include Harris, but asked separately about Harris if she were to run, 33% of respondents said they’d support her.\n\nSimilarly, in an Emerson College poll in February, 57% said they’d support Harris, while 9% would back Porter and 4% Villaraigosa or Kounalakis.\n\nGerston said Porter will be bolstered by her reputation as a consumer protection advocate at a time when voters are fed up with inflation and the cost of living — from housing to the wildfire-related insurance crisis.\n\nPorter was elected to represent a swath of Orange County in the U.S. House of Representatives in 2018, and left office in January. A law professor with degrees from Harvard and Yale, Porter quickly rose to prominence for her methodical take-downs of pharmaceutical and oil executives with the aid of her trusty whiteboard.\n\nThough that campaign likely raised her profile among California voters, her decision not to run for reelection in her Orange County swing district drew behind-the-scenes frustration from Democrats who campaigned hard to keep the seat, and her Senate campaign caused “bad blood” within the party, McCuan said.\n\nBut even with those limitations, Porter has a “clear lane” in the race, according to McCuan: her stalwart opposition to President Donald Trump.\n\n“Porter will take the tact that California is the center of the universe against Trump,” he said. “She owns that space.”\n\nIn her announcement video posted Tuesday on X, Porter takes direct aim at Trump and his allies, including billionaire Elon Musk.\n\n“What we need is new ideas, and the willingness to take on dangerous leaders,” Porter says, as the video flashes images of Trump, Musk and Republican leaders in Congress.\n\n“As governor, I won’t ever back down when Trump hurts Californians — whether he’s holding up disaster relief, attacking our rights or our communities or screwing over working families to benefit himself and his cronies,” Porter adds.\n\nThat’s a notable message at a time when California Democrats are trying to toe the line between criticizing Trump and seeking to work with his administration.\n\nNewsom, who is expected to run for president in 2028, has recently taken a more conciliatory approach and made overtures to conservatives as he seeks billions of dollars of federal relief for victims of the January firestorm in Los Angeles.\n\nIn the state Legislature, Democratic lawmakers say they’re more focused on the cost of living than opposing Trump this year. However, state Democrats recently passed $50 million to fund lawsuits against the Trump administration and defend immigrants from deportation — plans initially billed as “Trump-proofing” California.\n\nJessica Millan Patterson, chairwoman of the California GOP, said Porter’s attacks on Trump are misdirected.\n\n“California already has a governor more focused on Trump-proofing the state than fixing the problems that plague it,” she said in an email, “and they don’t need another.”","summary":"Experts say the 2026 race for California governor is drawing strong female candidates.

Bush argued that the nation was \"the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world.\"\n\nBut to President Donald Trump, the United States is the all-powerful player in a series of high-stakes transactions.\n\n\"You don't have the cards right now,\" he lectured President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine in their extraordinary Oval Office showdown.\n\nTrump is radically different from his Republican predecessors in countless ways. But rarely is the contrast starker than in his approach to U.S. leadership in the world.\n\nWhile those Republicans sometimes spoke of global alliances in terms of good and evil, Trump joined with the United States' adversaries to oppose a United Nations resolution condemning Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and falsely suggested that Ukraine had started the war. While they championed free trade, he has started trade wars. And while they argued that U.S. assistance abroad could fend off problems at home, he has moved to gut foreign aid.\n\nNow, Trump's nakedly transactional style is forcing Americans to reimagine how they see their country's place in the world, according to interviews with roughly two dozen voters, foreign policy experts and current and former elected officials from across the country.\n\n\"I fear we are risking what made us great over the last 80 years, since the close of the Second World War,\" said R. Nicholas Burns, a former ambassador to NATO and China. \"Every president until now adhered to democratic principles and values, including the idea that America should be the standard-bearer for democracy around the world, to uphold the rule of law and defend the sovereignty and territorial integrity of each country.\"\n\nHere's a snapshot of how Trump's moves on the global stage have alarmed an ideologically diverse range of critics, left other Americans deeply torn and delighted his supporters.\n\nThe Disillusioned Idealists\n\nThe Oval Office dressing-down of Zelenskyy shocked U.S. allies abroad. But it was especially distressing to some people in Pennsylvania.\n\nThe state is home to one of the nation's largest populations of people of Ukrainian ancestry, and Zelenskyy visited an ammunition factory in Scranton last fall, where he thanked workers for manufacturing artillery shells to support Ukraine. Vice President JD Vance mischaracterized that trip as a campaign stop as he berated Zelenskyy at the White House.\n\nIn Scranton, some recoiled, said Mayor Paige Gebhardt Cognetti, a Democrat who noted that City Hall has displayed the Ukrainian flag.\n\n\"It's really a personal affront here in Scranton, the idea that the American government would turn its back on Ukraine, and really turn its back on Europe,\" she said.\n\nShe warned against taking American global strength for granted.\n\n\"I worry that the Trump administration, maybe some of the Americans who support this current administration, think that America, well, 'we've always been so strong,'\" she said. \"They're really playing with fire.\"\n\nTwo hours south of Scranton, Karen Curry, 65, was having lunch at the Eagle Diner in Warminster, Pennsylvania, in politically competitive Bucks County. Curry, who said she voted for Trump in 2016 but backed former Vice President Kamala Harris last fall, said the Trump administration was threatening America's standing.\n\n\"My whole life, I felt like we were the leaders of the free world, that America was the moral compass,\" said Curry, who said she was a registered Republican. \"Now, we have a transactional president who's more interested in padding his own pockets and his legacy, and really likes powerful dictators. If we continue down this path, I don't think we're going to be the leaders of the free world.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe concerns go beyond issues of war and peace.\n\nIn Columbia, South Carolina, Mayor Daniel Rickenmann, a Republican, said he understood the Trump administration's emphasis on promoting manufacturing in the United States.\n\n\"At the same time, we can't isolate ourselves from the rest of the world,\" he said, speaking in particular of trade policy. \"I'm worried about that.\"\n\nMany Americans across the political spectrum have long been idealistic about the United States' role as a global power, viewing the nation as a force for good and a champion of democracy, even if the historical record is far more complex.\n\nKristin Ortlieb, 51, of Buckingham, Pennsylvania, said she had always viewed America as a global leader with obligations to provide aid and work to advance \"the greater good.\"\n\n\"With Trump in office, in my view, we have lost that vision and that leadership,\" she said. \"If you look at leaders in other parts of the world, they have long memories, and they will remember when the U.S. abandoned them.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nRecent polling suggests that Americans largely disagree with Trump's claim that Ukraine is the aggressor in its war with Russia, and are more inclined to sympathize with Ukraine than Russia.\n\nThe People Reserving Judgment\n\nTrump won the election last year in part because he successfully cast himself -- again -- as a change agent.\n\nAnd some Americans, even a few who backed Harris, say they are keeping an open mind about his norm-shattering approach at a time of protracted conflict in Ukraine and the Middle East.\n\nAlan Almonte, 34, a manager at a consulting firm in Philadelphia, said he was a political independent who voted for Harris, and worried about what he saw as Trump's \"bullying\" tactics. But, he said, \"the old methods are not working.\"\n\n\"It's unconventional,\" he said, though he continued, \"The way we're doing things, I don't feel is getting things done.\"\n\nState Rep. Keith Harris, a Democrat from Philadelphia, said Zelenskyy \"did deserve some respect.\" But he agreed with Trump's emphasis on ending the war.\n\n\"That's one thing Trump may be right about,\" he said. Zelenskyy, he added, \"can't keep asking for money when he can't win.\"\n\nOn Capitol Hill, Rep. Mike Lawler, R-N.Y., who is from a competitive district and a vocal supporter of Ukraine, said \"we can agree or disagree at times on rhetoric.\"\n\nBut he argued that to reach a settlement between Russia and Ukraine, \"you actually have to get both parties to the table, which requires engaging those with which we disagree,\" adding, \"And in this case, it would be Russia.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nU.S. officials have also had talks with Hamas officials about Israeli American hostages taken to the Gaza Strip, and Trump has raised the possibility of reopening negotiations over Iran's nuclear program.\n\n\"He's strong enough to talk to adversaries or look them in the eye and make clear what America will stand for,\" said Brian Hughes, a National Security Council spokesperson. \"President Trump's approach is, there's no greater force for peace and stability in the world than a strong American homeland.\"\n\nAsked about the view, widely held by his critics, that Trump is overly susceptible to flattery, Hughes replied, \"I don't believe any adversary anywhere in the world believes that flattery will diminish his exercise of America's strength.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nThe Supporters Who Like the Tough Talk\n\nLast week, Sen. Elissa Slotkin of Michigan delivered the Democrats' response to Trump's address to Congress -- and in many ways, she sounded more like a traditional Republican than he did.\n\n\"Trump would have lost us the Cold War,\" she said from Wyandotte, Michigan, arguing that his actions \"suggest that, in his heart, he doesn't believe we're an exceptional nation.\"\n\nBut on the ground in working-class Wyandotte, some voters argued that Trump's combative approach to the world was what the country needed.\n\nCarrying a box of meat as he left a Polish butcher shop, Jeff Zarenski, 59, a millwright from nearby Brownstown, said approvingly that the United States was \"turning more into the bully.\"\n\n\"Some people are getting pissed off at us,\" said Zarenski, a Trump supporter. \"I like it. It's a show of strength.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nIn affluent Brookhaven, Georgia, an Atlanta suburb, Willie Candler, 28, a real estate agent and a self-described center-right Republican, was milder in tone, but said he, too, supported Trump's foreign policy.\n\n\"It can be kind of in your face, or ruffle some feathers,\" he said. \"I've got a different style for the way I approach sales. But at the end of the day, if he gets the result that's beneficial to America, then I think it's good.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"Abraham Lincoln suggested the United States was \"the last, best hope of Earth.\" Ronald Reagan celebrated it as a \"shining city on a hill.\" George W.

But a huge unknown remains: whether former Vice President Kamala Harris will jump in.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom cannot run for reelection because state law limits governors to two terms. Most of the Democrats who have entered the open race so far are current or former state officials who have experience in the statehouse but are little known to the public. Voters are much more familiar with Porter -- a law professor who served six years in Congress representing Orange County -- polls show.\n\nPorter announced her campaign Tuesday by releasing a video that cast herself as someone who would fight to counter President Donald Trump's agenda and bring a fresh lens to the state Capitol, where she has never served in an elected office.\n\n\"I'm also going to be very focused, laser focused, on the cost of living for Californians. I think that's the biggest challenge that we face across the state,\" Porter said in an interview Tuesday.\n\nAfter losing the presidential election in November, Harris returned home to Los Angeles and has contemplated a run for California governor. Porter will drop out of the race if Harris runs, a spokesperson said.\n\nIn the interview Tuesday, Porter said that Harris would have \"a powerful, field-clearing effect\" for Democrats in the race, and that she has long been a supporter of the former vice president. In 2012, when Harris was California's attorney general, she appointed Porter to monitor a legal settlement with major banks over the foreclosure crisis.\n\nOther Democrats who have announced campaigns for California governor include Eleni Kounalakis, the lieutenant governor and a longtime friend of Harris; Antonio Villaraigosa, a former mayor of Los Angeles; Betty Yee, a former state controller; Toni Atkins, a former state legislative leader; and Tony Thurmond, the state schools superintendent. Chad Bianco, the Riverside County sheriff, is the most prominent Republican to enter the race so far.\n\nPorter lost a bid last year for the Senate seat previously held by Dianne Feinstein, the longtime senator who died in 2023. She finished third in the state's open primary, in which the top two candidates advance regardless of party registration.\n\nPorter was second in some early polls, indicating that she had a chance to face off in the general election against Adam Schiff, then a fellow Democratic House member who consistently led in surveys. But the closing months of the primary featured heavy spending by Schiff and his allies, who focused their ads on Steve Garvey, a Republican and a former baseball star who had never held office.\n\nThe campaign spots promoted Garvey as a Trump backer and helped to coalesce conservative votes behind him, and he finished in second place ahead of Porter.\n\nAfter the race, Porter decried \"an onslaught of billionaires spending millions to rig this election,\" referring to backers of Schiff, who went on to win the general election in a landslide and now represents California in the Senate. Critics in her own party said that she had been wrong to use language that they said echoed Trump and sowed doubt around the integrity of the state's election system.\n\nShe later said she regretted using the word \"rig\" but maintained her larger point -- that the race had been influenced by tech investors and cryptocurrency executives who spent $10 million on advertising that worked against her.\n\nPorter's Senate campaign highlighted her experience as a single mother raising three children in an expensive state. She coupled populist economic messages with campaign ads that showed home-cooked meals packaged in the fridge, and she published a book, \"I Swear: Politics Is Messier Than My Minivan.\"\n\nSimilar themes run through the three-minute video that Porter released to announce her campaign for governor. It shows her inside the kitchen of her suburban home, talking to the camera about the \"out of control\" costs of groceries, health care and housing and sitting beside her daughter, who is doing homework.\n\n\"As governor, I won't ever back down when Trump hurts Californians, whether it's holding up disaster relief, attacking our rights and our communities, or screwing over working families to benefit himself and his cronies,\" Porter said in the video.\n\nPorter first ran for Congress in 2018 and flipped a Republican-held seat, which was part of the so-called \"blue wave\" in which Democrats regained control of the House. She won reelection twice before she ran in last year's Senate race. She returned to teaching law school at the University of California, Irvine, this year.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"Katie Porter, the former Democratic member of Congress who rose to prominence by wielding a whiteboard while she grilled corporate executives on Capitol Hill, announced Tuesday that she would enter the 2026 contest for California governor.","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/katie-porter-will-run-for-california-governor/article_d79b2dfb-047c-592f-8399-4173edc7f8d0.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 22:31:13","author":"Laurel Rosenhall,North Adams Pride","authors":["Laurel Rosenhall","North Adams Pride"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.162},{"id":299179842,"title":"MeidasTouch Pops on Podcast Charts as Progressives Search for Answers","text":"Soon after the recent contentious Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., went on camera to offer his assessment.\n\n\"I was horrified and sickened,\" Schiff said. \"This is Donald Trump caring about nothing of American values,\" he later added.\n\nMore than 2.2 million people watched Schiff. But he wasn't talking on MSNBC or on CNN. Instead, he was appearing on the YouTube channel of the MeidasTouch Network, an upstart online media company known for its relentless critiques of Trump, delivered in a blizzard of bare-bones, outrage-heavy videos, clips, podcasts and social media posts.\n\nMeidasTouch is a leader among the numerous digital-first outlets that have been rapidly reshaping the progressive media landscape since Trump took office. Tapping into agita among progressives about the new administration's policies, they are fast becoming power brokers in Democratic politics and -- party faithful hope -- finally replicating the influential media ecosystem that Republicans have built over the past decade.\n\n\"Pod Save America,\" the podcast hosted by former operatives of President Barack Obama, for example, has clocked a 70% increase in hours played on Spotify since mid-January. And the number of subscribers to the YouTube channel for \"The Young Turks,\" a left-wing news show that streams live five days a week, jumped 208% last month.\n\nBut perhaps no metric underscores the new attention to progressive media more than last month's revelation that \"The MeidasTouch Podcast\" had usurped Joe Rogan's show atop both Apple's and Spotify's rankings for downloads, a slot the show held for two weeks. (Rogan reclaimed the top spot this past week.)\n\n\"We're providing a comforting place where we're channeling people's feelings during a real difficult time,\" said Ben Meiselas, a lawyer who founded MeidasTouch with his two brothers as a political action committee in 2020 before converting it into a media business three years ago.\n\nFor its devoted fans, who call themselves the Meidas Mighty, MeidasTouch presents an alternate reality in which Democrats are ascendant and Trump and Republicans are in a state of collapse. Titles of recent podcast episodes, which are also streamed on YouTube, include \"Trump in Panic After Caving Like a Coward,\" \"Trump Crumbles in Public as His Entire Life Unravels\" and \"Democratic Leaders Destroy Trump in Red Districts.\"\n\nToday, MeidasTouch has 12 full-time employees and 30 regular contributors, including former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen, and 4.3 million subscribers on YouTube. When it comes to setting the agenda for Democratic discourse, Meiselas said, \"I think digital is far more significant and important than TV now.\"\n\nOf course, television is far from dead. But center and left-leaning networks have steadily lost ground to Fox News, the runaway leader in ratings among cable news networks. Last month, Fox aired every one of the 10 top-rated shows on cable news.\n\nThat has pushed increasing numbers of Democratic politicians to turn to digital media in search of larger and younger audiences.\n\n\"We were getting shellacked in new media,\" said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., who leads the Senate Democratic Strategic Communications Committee. Democrats, in particular former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris, have been roundly criticized for their reluctant approach to nontraditional outlets, which contrasted with Trump's enthusiastic embrace of right-wing influencers and podcasts.\n\nIn January, Booker's committee and its House counterpart posted job openings for social media managers to help forge relationships with digital creators. Booker has also invited influencers such as Brian Tyler Cohen, a popular YouTube host who said he has gained 250,000 subscriptions to his YouTube page in the past two weeks, to run digital media training for Democrats. They're taught how to record their own videos, use better lighting and microphones and stop worrying about swearing on camera.\n\nCohen, a former MSNBC contributor who has 3.9 million subscribers and also pumps out content on TikTok, Instagram and X, described the shift online as \"existential\" for Democrats and one that had been long in coming.\n\n\"I couldn't get anyone to do my show before,\" he said. \"Now I have to juggle all the requests from A-listers who want to come on.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nSome politicians are jumping directly into the fray. Gov. Gavin Newsom of California last week started a podcast that features interviews with what he called \"some of the biggest leaders and architects in the MAGA movement.\" In his opening interview with Charlie Kirk, a founder of the pro-Trump organization Turning Point USA, Newsom said he'd like to emulate the frenetic, and constantly on-message, vibe of right-wing media.\n\nThat might prove harder than it sounds. Podcasts hosted by other Democrats -- such as \"Inside Maine With Senator Angus King\" -- have failed to attract large audiences. Other attempts to be digital forward have looked more like face-plants. Last week, for example, Booker and more than a dozen other senators were criticized for posting nearly identical responses to Trump's speech to Congress. Booker later acknowledged writing the script that he and his colleagues had read.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nOn the web, a podcast appearance can be watched live, downloaded to be seen later, posted on multiple platforms and cut into segments that can live on for hours or even days, creating exponentially more opportunities for engagement.\n\nAfter Trump's speech to Congress on Tuesday, Adam Mockler, MeidasTouch's in-house Gen-Z influencer, generated more than 250,000 views livestreaming reactions from Democrats, including Rep. Eric Swalwell of California and Ken Martin, the new chair of the Democratic National Committee.\n\nThen Acyn Torabi, a MeidasTouch employee who specializes in spotting potentially viral content and cutting it into traffic-generating short clips, posted excerpts from those interviews on X, racking up nearly 1 million more views.\n\nMeiselas and his brothers, Brett and Jordy, post a dozen or more 10- to 20-minute-long news segments -- nearly all featuring the search-engine-optimizing word \"Trump\" in their title -- on YouTube every day. That torrent is supplemented by other shows produced by MeidasTouch contributors.\n\nThat constant stream of bite-size content gives listeners more episodes to download, helping to lift the outlet's ranking on podcast charts. In February, MeidasTouch had 57.5 million podcast downloads, according to Podscribe, a tracker, ranking it ahead of \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" and Candace Owens' podcast, even though they had significantly more listeners per episode.\n\n\"You have to move fast,\" said Ron Filipkowski, a former Republican with nearly 1 million followers on X who was hired in 2023 to edit the MeidasTouch website. In September, he helped start the company's newsletter on Substack; it has grown to more than 500,000 subscribers, some 40,000 of whom pay at least $8 a month to get ad-free and exclusive content. He also records a weekly podcast of his own, \"Uncovered,\" which focuses on right-wing misinformation.\n\n\"A lot of what we do no one else does, and that's why our following has grown,\" Filipkowski said.\n\nOther outlets are adapting to keep up. Tommy Vietor, a co-host of \"Pod Save America,\" which is known for in-depth, and often quite lengthy, interviews with Democratic insiders, said he had lately been experimenting with short-form videos that he uploaded directly to TikTok.\n\n\"Trump is the most relentless communicator in the history of politics, and he has the biggest platform,\" Vietor said. \"So the only way Democrats can begin to compete with that is by communicating constantly, everywhere, all the time.\"\n\n(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)\n\nDespite the recent successes, the left does not yet have a true analog to the loudest right-wing voices like Elon Musk and Ben Shapiro.\n\nMelissa Kiesche, a senior vice president at Edison Research, which ranks podcasts, said that while reaching the top spot on Apple and Spotify was a laudable achievement, MeidasTouch's total reach was still miles behind Rogan's. She noted, for example, that he has roughly five times as many subscribers on YouTube as MeidasTouch.\n\n\"Nothing even comes close,\" Kiesche said.\n\nLast week, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., invited Carlos Eduardo Espina, a left-wing influencer who delivers news updates in Spanish and has 12.3 million followers on TikTok, to be his guest for Trump's speech to Congress and to post videos commenting on the event. The 11 videos Espina uploaded to the site about the event have racked up more than 17 million views.\n\nBut Khanna argues that until more members of his party begin to see social media influencers as an integral part of the movement, it will be impossible to catch up.\n\n\"I think the right has really created a space in the digital world where people feel they're part of a community,\" he said. \"And the left has not done that.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"Soon after the recent contentious Oval Office meeting between President Donald Trump and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, Sen.

By the time Williams and Wilmore get home, they will have spent 284 days in space.\n\nTheir mission could stretch even longer if the Crew-10 mission is delayed. But if Sunday’s dry-run is any indication, the launch should go off without a hitch.\n\n‘We are going to take a little bit of an adventure,’ McClain, who is a U.S. Army colonel and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter pilot, told Florida Today\n\n‘We’re ready to high-five them, bring them home.’\n\nAfter the crew members left the launch pad, SpaceX conducted tests of the Falcon 9 rocket that will be used to launch the Dragon spacecraft. \n\nOnce Crew-10 boards the ISS, they will live on the space station for six months, carrying on the work that the Starliner and Crew-9 astronauts were conducting before they arrived. \n\nThe capsule set to take Williams and Wilmore home is already docked at the ISS.\n\nAlso joining the stranded astronauts on the return mission will be NASA’s Nick Hague and Russia’s Aleksandr Gorbunov, who arrived at the ISS in September 2024.\n\nMcClain, the mission’s commander, said Friday that she and her fellow Crew-10 mates have been in constant contact with all four on the orbiting laboratory.\n\nProgram Manager Steve Stich said Crew-10 backup launch opportunities are available at 7:25pm Thursday and 7:04pm Friday.\n\nWhile the capsule has been docked on the ISS for months, the crew had to wait for Crew-10’s arrival before they can return to Earth.\n\nThat’s because NASA protocol calls for a ‘handover period’ when transitioning between ISS crews. \n\nThis is a few days of overlap between the incoming astronauts and the outgoing ones allows the departing crew to get the new astronauts up to speed on space station operations and ensures a smooth transition between ISS teams. \n\nThe handover period usually lasts five days, but this time, NASA shortened it to just two days to conserve food on the ISS and open up more undocking opportunities for the Crew-9 spacecraft in case the weather interferes with its March 16 return.\n\nWhen the pair launched aboard Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft on June 5, they were only supposed to spend eight days on the ISS.\n\nBut a series of technical issues with Starliner, including thruster failures and helium leaks, ultimately drove NASA to send the faulty spacecraft home without its crew in September.\n\nThe crew’s delayed return recently entered the political spotlight after SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk and President Donald Trump claimed the astronauts were ‘abandoned’ in space by the Biden administration for ‘political reasons.’\n\nMusk has said that the former president rejected his offer to bring the Starliner crew home earlier because it would have made Donald Trump ‘look good.’\n\nMusk backed Trump during the 2024 presidential race, donating $288 million to his campaign and appearing at several MAGA rallies.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk claimed the Biden administration rejected his offer to bring the Starliner astronauts home sooner to avoid making Trump ‘look good.’\n\nHe explained that the former administration did not want to jeopardize Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign and intentionally ‘pushed the return date past the inauguration date.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe crew set to relieve NASA&#8217;s stranded astronauts were all smiles as&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: NASA rescue team of four crew members are ready to swap places with stranded astronauts first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/nasa-rescue-team-of-four-crew-members-are-ready-to-swap-places-with-stranded-astronauts/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rewrite-this-title-Four-man-NASA-rescue-crew-give-thumbs-up.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 22:00:11","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.274},{"id":299175188,"title":"The Team Behind a New Blockbuster Says Its Villain Isn’t Based on Trump. Yeah, Right.","text":"After Bong Joon Ho’s Parasite won the Oscar for Best Picture in 2020, becoming the first non-English-language film to do so, then-President Donald Trump declared himself displeased. At a campaign rally right after that win, Trump said, “What the hell was that all about? We’ve got enough problems with South Korea with trade. On top of that, they give them best movie of the year. Was it good? I don’t know.” To the audience’s cheers, he declared that he missed the days when Hollywood made movies like Gone With the Wind and Sunset Boulevard.\n\nNow Bong Joon Ho is back, with Mickey 17, a story about a worker (Robert Pattinson) who, in debt to some bad people, signs on to a colony expedition, desperate to leave Earth. Because he has no particular skills that would qualify him for a berth, he agrees to be an “expendable.” Mickey gets all the worst, most dangerous jobs—external spaceship repairs that expose him to dangerous levels of radiation, inhaling the air of a new planet to test whether there’s a human-killing virus—because he’s agreed for his personhood to be uploaded and his body to be printed out again and again. At the time the story begins, he’s on his 17th body, when, mistakenly, the expedition prints out his 18th, creating a dreaded situation: the existence of “multiples.”\n\nThe antagonist in the story, Kenneth Marshall (Mark Ruffalo), is the leader of this expedition, a smarmy, evil ex-politician with veneers, a TV show, and a hovering wife (Toni Collette) who’s the true brains of the Marshall operation. At a recruitment event, we see that the other prospective colonists are all Marshall freaks and several of them are wearing red baseball hats; one of them tries to speak to Marshall through a news broadcast. Marshall, an empty suit with preposterous hair, is obsessed with his image and being on television, isn’t religious but uses religion to manipulate people, does a dorky little dance to pump people up, hoards all the wealth on the ship while his loyal followers eat glops of gray paste, gets excited at the idea of colonizing a “pure, white planet,” and, at one point, barely escapes a bullet aimed at his head.\n\nThis is Donald Trump, right? Kenneth Marshall is Bong’s revenge? But hold on a minute. Not only was this movie shot long before Trump escaped a bullet in Pennsylvania this past summer, but in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Bong says that although he is aware that people consider Ruffalo’s Marshall to be a Trump analog, he swears he isn’t. Marshall, he says, is “a mix of many different politicians” and “dictators that we have seen throughout history.” Bong points to the audience reaction as proof that Marshall is an archetype, not a caricature: “When we showed the film in Berlin and talked to people from many different countries, it seemed like people were projecting the most stressful political leader onto the character of Marshall.” The omnipresence of Marshall’s wife, he said, tied the character closer to other historical figures than to Trump. “They move as a couple,” Bong explained. “To me, that was quite important. So think about the Ceaușescu couple from Romania and the Marcos couple from the Philippines. It’s always very uncanny when dictators move as couples. It makes them even more ridiculous and more terrifying.” (Bong also says to this interviewer, who asked about Trump’s public Parasite commentary: “I don’t hold it against him. He can have his own opinion. He mentioned Gone With the Wind and Sunset Boulevard. I like Sunset Boulevard. Billy Wilder is amazing.”)\n\nBut Mark Ruffalo, appearing on Jimmy Fallon’s late-night show to promote the movie, didn’t seem to have gotten the message that the movie wasn’t supposed to be “about Trump.” “I play a petty dictator,” he said, slyly employing the art of the strategic pause to add irony, as the audience laughed. “We shot it three years ago, and I thought, This is over the top, at the time. And now I realize it’s totally underplayed. I made a documentary.” Ruffalo, a longtime member of the #Resistance, looked as if he were in his element.\n\nWhom to trust, Bong or Ruffalo? It helps to look at the book. In adapting Edward Ashton’s 2022 novel Mickey 7, Bong, who also wrote the screenplay, made a number of changes, including adding a full 10 deaths to the character’s history. But he also significantly expanded the character of Commander Marshall, adding many of the Trumplike characteristics that people have been noticing, enjoying, hating, or just trying to ignore while watching the movie.\n\nAshton’s main character, Mickey 7, is much less of a hapless fool than Pattinson’s Mickey 17. He’s just a man who never really found his calling. He describes himself as “a historian”—an occupation that doesn’t pay him and that gets met with scorn when he mentions it to the ship recruiter when he goes to sign up to be an Expendable. (In this future world, much like our own, there’s not much of a job market for professional historians.) This conceit of having a narrator who’s also a historian lets Ashton do a lot more world-building, explaining the inner workings of the colony ship, the character of Commander Marshall, and the actions of the colonists—all of which, in the movie adaptation, gets swept up instead in Bong’s story of a man with a very dangerous cult of personality.\n\nIn the novel, the civilization Mickey is trying to escape is not Earth but Midgard, a third-generation colony, which was itself part of what everyone calls the “diaspora” away from Old Earth. The impetus for the diaspora is not, as in the movie, generalized collapse and possibly climate change but, rather, a technological shift—the invention of antimatter and its use as a weapon. Mickey, who has a lot of time on his hands during the interstellar journey, reads up on the failures of previous colonies and tells us about them: Roanoke, the victims of local microorganisms; Asher’s World, which thought its target planet had a better atmosphere than it did; New Hope, felled by civil war. This is a universe where traveling on a colony ship is common, and there are rules to it.\n\nAnother bit of history, narrated by Mickey 7, explains the strong taboo against “multiples” that drives the plot of both the novel and the movie. A colony called Gault, made up of wealthy people mad about being taxed on their home planet (get it??), died off after Alan Manikova, a sociopathic scientist with a large amount of family wealth, invented the process for replication of human brains that later makes the Expendables program possible. Manikova, armed with this new technology, flew to Gault, infiltrated its fragmented society, captured colonists, and used their bodies to replicate himself again and again. It’s Manikova, rather than Marshall, who’s probably the biggest traditional villain in Mickey 7. Not only did he kill thousands of wealthy libertarians and make them into copies of himself, but he also caused the death of the colony planet, one of the few Goldilocks planets in the universe, by forcing a neighbor to do a kamikaze mission that renders it completely uninhabitable. This is the situation that creates the taboo against multiples—a much more drastic one than what happens in Mickey 17.\n\nThe novel’s Marshall is a natalist, a fundamentalist who doesn’t believe in the printing of humans. This—a belief well explained by the history of Gault—is what makes him into Mickey’s opposition. He doesn’t seem to be a racist; he’s more of a Puritan. He’s got “brush-cut salt-and-pepper hair,” a military bearing, and a first name from ancient Earth: Hieronymus. Marshall, Mickey explains while describing their first meeting, was “someone who thought of himself as In Charge of Things.” The guy “looks like he has a metal rod for a spine even in free fall.” Mickey eventually figures out that Marshall is made up of “ten percent priggishness, ten percent insecurity, and eighty percent overcompensation.” Although this might sound Trumpish on its face, the book’s Marshall is less of an emperor with no clothes, and more of a soldier trained to exert control, who’s reacting poorly to the circumstances of his post. Due to the rules of the ship, since Marshall’s only a ground commander, he “might as well have been cargo for the entirety of the transit.”\n\nThis is the thing about this particular leader: Ashton’s Marshall is far from all-powerful or, really, evil. During the voyage, when he finds out that Mickey was in debt to a loan shark, he wants to kill him, but he’s stopped by the captain of the ship, who has command of the mission until it reaches the target planet. Even after landfall, when Marshall is in command, the Mickey multiples are discovered with their lover Nasha, and Marshall threatens to throw them down the cycler, Nasha points out: “This colony wasn’t chartered as a theocracy. You can’t just burn us at the stake.” He doesn’t do it—for plot reasons, but also because he isn’t, at his heart, an irrational man. As Eight says to Marshall, trying to talk him out of killing both Seven and Eight and wiping their template: “You’ve got a stick up your ass most of the time, but you’re not some kind of villain from a vid drama, and I don’t know why you’re trying to act like one now.”\n\nThe ship on Mickey 17, on the other hand, is a little world unto itself, ruled only by two psychopaths—Kenneth Marshall and his wife. They can change the rules as they like, and only assassination and overthrow will stop them. In adapting Mickey 7, Bong has made it into a real Bong movie. He’s taken a colony-ship story that takes place in a universe of history, precedent, and law, and a supporting character of an upright, religious military leader, and made each of them into something that is much more cinematic: a hermetic, oppressive dystopia, and a vid-drama villain.\n\nI believe the director that the Trump parallels we see in Bong’s Marshall were meant to be seasoning rather than the main dish. If Kamala Harris had won in November, we’d be reading this movie a lot differently. (Although, even then, there would have been parallels: Marshall begins the movies as a politician who’s been cast aside following his defeat.) But we are stuck in this timeline, where every dystopia feels like our own. We can only hope we land on a better planet soon.","summary":"For one thing, he’s not at all like that in the book.","url":"https://slate.com/culture/2025/03/mickey-17-trump-movie-book-mark-ruffalo-review.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/46b44e9a-a003-4912-b741-638920d749b8.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 21:57:37","author":"Rebecca Onion","authors":["Rebecca Onion"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.078},{"id":299171070,"title":"Ex-U.S. Rep.

One picture showed O’Donnell behind the wheel of a vehicle, with a caption noting that she was driving on the opposite side of the road than in America.\n\n“Bought a little used car to tool around the countryside on the wrong side of the road,” the former “View” co-host wrote. “Hit the curb three times — thought I hit a cat !!! #newadventures ❤️.”\n\nAnother snap included Dakota sitting in the back seat of the car with a backpack next to her. O’Donnell wrote beneath the snap that she was taking her daughter to class, adding that she “can’t wait to walk to school” with her.\n\nHowever, O’Donnell is not in a league of her own. Other celebrities also took the opportunity to leave the United States after President Trump was elected.\n\nEva Longoria and her family have fled the United States for life in Mexico and Spain.\n\n“I had my whole adult life here,” the actress, 49, told Marie Claire in November. “But even before [the pandemic], it was changing. The vibe was different. And then COVID happened, and it pushed it over the edge. Whether it’s the homelessness or the taxes, not that I want to s–t on California — it just feels like this chapter in my life is done now.”\n\n“The shocking part is not that he won,” Longoria said of Trump’s victory over former Vice President Kamala Harris. “It’s that a convicted criminal who spews so much hate could hold the highest office.”\n\nEllen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi also swapped their luxurious life in Montecito, California, for the English countryside after Trump’s win.","summary":"\"I was never someone who thought I would move to another country,\" O'Donnell shared, \"and here we are.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/11/entertainment/rosie-odonnell-confirms-she-moved-to-ireland-after-trump-election/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/100286101-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/XQmAZ3jW-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-11 20:59:33","author":"Alexandra Bellusci","authors":["Alexandra Bellusci"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.077},{"id":299166972,"title":"Media: A collective surrender to Trump?","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nMedia: A collective surrender to Trump?\n\nThe Washington Post’s staff are instructed to focus its opinion pages on promoting 'personal liberties' and 'free markets'\n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nOther media owners are also waving the white flag on President Trump.\n\n(Image credit: Ting Shen / Bloomberg via Getty Images)\n\nBy The Week US\n published 11 March 2025 \n\nThe free press in America is suffering a drawn-out “death of despair,” said George Packer in The Atlantic, and The Washington Post may be the first to go. Just months after he meddled in editorial decisions by nixing the Post’s presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris, owner Jeff Bezos last week sent a note to staff decreeing that the paper’s opinion pages would now focus on championing “two pillars: personal liberties and free markets.” Left unmentioned was how, or even whether, the opinion pages will cover the growing authoritarianism of the second Trump administration. Other media owners are also waving the white flag on President Trump. In December, Disney settled his “weak” $16 million defamation suit against ABC News; CBS may soon settle “an even more dubious” $20 billion Trump lawsuit over a 60 Minutes editing decision. Rather than hard-nosed news outlets focused on truth-telling, these companies are behaving like a “circus animal that doesn’t need a trainer to tell it to jump.”\n\n“Please excuse Bezos if he acts like the owner of the publication he owns,” said Rich Lowry in National Review. It’s the norm for owners “to determine the editorial line of a newspaper.” But to the likes of former Post opinion editor David Shipley—who quit in disgust over Bezos’ order—and many current Post employees and readers, it’s the stuff of tyranny. Their outrage illustrates the Left’s fundamental “intolerance of dissenting news sources,” even ones committed to genuinely American principles such as “personal liberties and free markets.”\n\nBezos’ note is, “in its plain language,” unobjectionable, said Dana Milbank in The Washington Post. The question is whether he will let this paper fight the biggest danger to his twin pillars: President Trump. We should be challenging his mass deportation orders and barring of unfavored outlets from the White House press pool—both attacks on liberty—and his attempts to kill off free trade with punitive tariffs against allies. Will the Post keep speaking out against those threats? Don’t count on it, said Justin Peters in Slate. Bezos sees big opportunities in Trump’s hollowing out of government. Amazon’s AI ventures could take over services once provided by humans, for example, while Bezos’ rocket firm Blue Origin could step in for NASA. To grab this windfall, all he has to do is stay on Trump’s good side—and not let the Post say anything too mean. “Pragmatic oligarchs” like Bezos will “gladly help set the world on fire as long as they can bid on the contract to clear the debris.”\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

As the former running mate to Kamala Harris in their 2024 bid against Donald Trump and JD Vance, Walz argued that Democrats erred by avoiding bold risks. He suggested the campaign should have engaged more directly with voters through town halls, even if it meant facing tough criticism, rather than sticking to cautious messaging. Walz criticizes party’s media approachWalz, who earned praise early in the 2024 race for his relatable Midwestern appeal, also critiqued the party’s media approach. He compared their strategy to a defensive football play, implying Democrats focused too much on avoiding mistakes rather than seizing opportunities to connect. Some former Harris campaign aides echoed this sentiment, noting Walz’s potential to sway key states like Wisconsin was underutilized due to indecision at the campaign’s leadership level. Since the election, Walz has remained politically active, hinting at a possible 2028 presidential run. He emphasized his commitment to helping Democrats regain momentum, whether through future campaigns or supporting roles. Beyond interviews, Walz has focused on state-level initiatives in Minnesota, advocating for education reform, rural broadband expansion, and renewable energy projects. His efforts to bridge urban-rural divides and promote bipartisan policies have kept him visible in national discussions about the Democratic Party’s direction. Recently, Walz launched a cross-state tour to engage with communities on issues like healthcare access and infrastructure, positioning himself as a pragmatic leader addressing everyday challenges. His blend of grassroots outreach and policy work underscores his belief in proactive governance, a contrast to the caution he criticized in the 2024 campaign. As Democrats regroup, Walz’s mix of experience and willingness to challenge party norms keeps him a figure to watch in shaping the party’s future.","summary":"Former Democratic vice presidential candidate and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz has recently stated that the Democrats did not take enough risks during his failed campaign against President Trump.","url":"https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/kamala-harris-former-running-mate-tim-walz-criticizes-2024-campaign-says-democrats-must-embrace-bold-strategies/articleshow/118905018.cms","image":"https://img.etimg.com/thumb/msid-118905012,resizemode-4,width-1200,height-900,imgsize-30026,overlay-economictimes/articleshow.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 20:45:59","author":"The Feed","authors":["The Feed"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.349},{"id":299156086,"title":"Four-man NASA rescue crew give thumbs up as they prepare to be swapped with stranded astronauts","text":"Four-man NASA rescue crew give thumbs up as they prepare to be swapped with stranded astronauts\n\nREAD MORE: Stranded NASA astronauts' return date is changed AGAIN\n\nBy ELLYN LAPOINTE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 20:27 GMT, 11 March 2025 | Updated: 20:33 GMT, 11 March 2025\n\nThe crew set to relieve NASA's stranded astronauts were all smiles as they completed a dry-run for Wednesday's launch.\n\nSunita Williams and Butch Wilmore have spent nine months in space, waiting for their replacements before they can head back to Earth.\n\nNow, SpaceX Crew-10 is one step closer to making that happen. \n\nJapan's Takuya Onishi, Russia's Kirill Peskov, and NASA's Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers are scheduled to launch at 7:48pm ET tomorrow from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida.\n\nIf the launch goes according to plan, the capsule should dock to the ISS at roughly 10am ET on Thursday, allowing Williams and Wilmore to depart March 16. \n\nOn Sunday, Crew-10 spent the day 'donning spacesuits and completing air leak checks,' according to a NASA statement. \n\nOnce they suited up, the astronauts climbed aboard the SpaceX Dragon capsule that will bring them to the International Space Station (ISS) for a test run. By the time Williams and Wilmore get home, they will have spent 284 days in space.\n\nTheir mission could stretch even longer if the Crew-10 mission is delayed. But if Sunday's dry-run is any indication, the launch should go off without a hitch.\n\nCrew-10 mission pilot Nicole Ayers (left) and commander Anne McClain (right), both NASA astronauts, gave the thumbs-up during the launch dry-run Sunday \n\nNASA and SpaceX successfully completed a dry dress rehearsal of launch-day activities Sunday, and snapped a photo of Crew-10 giving a thumbs-up from inside the Dragon capsule\n\n'We are going to take a little bit of an adventure,' McClain, who is a U.S. Army colonel and OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopter pilot, told Florida Today\n\n'We're ready to high-five them, bring them home.'\n\nAfter the crew members left the launch pad, SpaceX conducted tests of the Falcon 9 rocket that will be used to launch the Dragon spacecraft. \n\nOnce Crew-10 boards the ISS, they will live on the space station for six months, carrying on the work that the Starliner and Crew-9 astronauts were conducting before they arrived. \n\nThe capsule set to take Williams and Wilmore home is already docked at the ISS.\n\nAlso joining the stranded astronauts on the return mission will be NASA's Nick Hague and Russia's Aleksandr Gorbunov, who arrived at the ISS in September 2024.\n\nMcClain, the mission's commander, said Friday that she and her fellow Crew-10 mates have been in constant contact with all four on the orbiting laboratory.\n\nProgram Manager Steve Stich said Crew-10 backup launch opportunities are available at 7:25pm Thursday and 7:04pm Friday.\n\nAfter Crew-10 reaches the ISS, NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore will finally get to come home after being stuck on the ISS for more than nine months\n\nOn Sunday, SpaceX conducted a static fire test of the Falcon 9 rocket that will be used to launch the Crew-10 Dragon spacecraft\n\nWhile the capsule has been docked on the ISS for months, the crew had to wait for Crew-10's arrival before they can return to Earth.\n\nThat's because NASA protocol calls for a 'handover period' when transitioning between ISS crews. \n\nThis is a few days of overlap between the incoming astronauts and the outgoing ones allows the departing crew to get the new astronauts up to speed on space station operations and ensures a smooth transition between ISS teams. \n\nNASA insider JEFF NOSANOV blows the whistle on the space agency's plot to sabotage Elon Musk's rescue mission... at the cost of our stranded astronauts\n\nThe handover period usually lasts five days, but this time, NASA shortened it to just two days to conserve food on the ISS and open up more undocking opportunities for the Crew-9 spacecraft in case the weather interferes with its March 16 return.\n\nWhen the pair launched aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft on June 5, they were only supposed to spend eight days on the ISS.\n\nBut a series of technical issues with Starliner, including thruster failures and helium leaks, ultimately drove NASA to send the faulty spacecraft home without its crew in September.\n\nThe crew's delayed return recently entered the political spotlight after SpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk and President Donald Trump claimed the astronauts were 'abandoned' in space by the Biden administration for 'political reasons.'\n\nMusk has said that the former president rejected his offer to bring the Starliner crew home earlier because it would have made Donald Trump 'look good.'\n\nMusk backed Trump during the 2024 presidential race, donating $288 million to his campaign and appearing at several MAGA rallies.\n\nDuring a recent appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk claimed the Biden administration rejected his offer to bring the Starliner astronauts home sooner to avoid making Trump 'look good.'\n\nHe explained that the former administration did not want to jeopardize Kamala Harris' presidential campaign and intentionally 'pushed the return date past the inauguration date.'\n\nSpaceXEarthISSNasaRussia\n\nShare or comment on

Are Fighting It Out in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court Race","text":"The Wisconsin Supreme Court race on April 1 may be technically nonpartisan, but it is already shaping up to be a battle between two billionaires with incompatible political worldviews: Elon Musk and George Soros.\n\nThe race appears on track to become the most expensive judicial election in U.S. history. Democrats have spent almost $18 million to boost Susan Crawford, while Republicans have spent about $12.7 million backing Brad Schimel.\n\nBoth Crawford and Schimel serve as circuit court judges and formerly worked as prosecutors. Schimel served as the Badger State’s attorney general from 2015 to 2019. Schimel has taken a “tough on crime” stance, while Crawford touts a case in which she represented Planned Parenthood.\n\nAccording to NBC News, Crawford has slammed Musk, who has contributed to two political action committees backing Schimel: Building America’s Future (which spent about $2.4 million on ads in the race) and America PAC (which has spent more than $4 million). It remains unclear how much Musk personally bankrolls these PACs.\n\n“You know, when I was a little girl growing up in Chippewa Falls, I never could have imagined that I’d be fighting the world’s richest man for justice in Wisconsin,” Crawford said.\n\nMeanwhile, liberal billionaire George Soros gave $1 million to the Wisconsin Democratic Party in January, while Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, a Democrat, gave $500,000, and Reid Hoffman, a well-known liberal donor, contributed $250,000. State campaign finance laws allow state parties to transfer cash to the candidates’ committees.\n\nSchimel campaign spokesman Jacob Fischer slammed Crawford for accepting money from “extremists like George Soros and JB Pritzker.”\n\nSo, why are Musk and Soros pouring money into this race?\n\n1. An Early Political Test in the Second Trump Era\n\nThree key elections will take place on April 1, and the Wisconsin Supreme Court race promises to be the most competitive.\n\nFlorida voters will elect two members to the House of Representatives, replacing Michael Waltz, a Republican who left to become President Donald Trump’s national security advisor, and Matt Gaetz, who resigned after Trump briefly nominated him to become attorney general. Both Gaetz and Waltz won with 66% of the vote in November, and their districts are likely to elect Republican candidates in April. Trump won both handily.\n\nTrump won Wisconsin by a narrow margin, however. Trump won with less than one percent more of the vote than Vice President Kamala Harris. He prevailed with 29,397 more votes in an election of more than 3 million votes. The left-leaning candidate won the last Badger State Supreme Court election, in April 2023, by ten points (54% to the conservative candidate’s 44%).\n\nAnalysts will closely watch this race, and some will call it a bellwether for where the country is headed in the 2026 midterm elections. \n\n2. The U.S. House of Representatives\n\nYes, you read that right. A Wisconsin Supreme Court race may swing the House. How? Because Democrats have been suing to change the Badger State’s redistricting in an attempt to get more left-leaning seats. Republicans currently have 218 seats in the House, while Democrats have 214. Even one seat may make the difference if the 2026 elections are close.\n\nThe Badger State’s Republican-majority Legislature drew up congressional maps that favor Republicans, but the state’s highest court threw those out as unconstitutional. As a compromise, the legislature passed maps drawn by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. Even though Evers signed those maps into law on Feb. 19, he urged the court to take up a legal challenge from the Elias Law Group, Politico reported.\n\nRepublicans hold six of Wisconsin’s eight congressional districts, with only two seen as competitive. The Elias Law Group’s proposal aims to make the districts more competitive. \n\nMarc Elias, a Democratic lawyer who frequently challenges election results (most recently the U.S. Senate race in Pennsylvania), seems likely to challenge the maps yet again. \n\n3. Bureaucracy or Democracy\n\nMusk and Soros don’t just represent two conflicting political parties. They represent two contradictory approaches to government. \n\nAs I exposed in my book, “The Woketopus: The Dark Money Cabal Manipulating the Federal Government,” Soros’ nonprofit, the Open Society Foundations, helps to bankroll a network of leftist groups that staffed and advised the Biden administration, pushing woke priorities on the American people through the bureaucracy. \n\nA preference for technocratic government—trust in “experts” more than in the voters and their elected representatives—forms a key part of the woke “progressive” mentality. \n\nThis approach helps explain why the deep state exists. A whopping 64% of Washington, D.C.-based federal bureaucrats who voted for Harris in the last election said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nSoros favors bureaucracy because the “experts” often align with him ideologically. \n\nMeanwhile, Musk has brought his approach to creative destruction into the government with the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nMadison is not Washington, D.C., but these basic approaches to government are at odds in the Badger State, just as they are in the nation’s capital.","summary":"The Wisconsin Supreme Court race on April 1 may be technically nonpartisan, but it is already shaping up to be a battle between two billionaires...

The people are so loving and so kind, so welcoming. And I’m very grateful,” O’Donnell said.\n\nO’Donnell, 62, said she’s currently in the process of getting her Irish citizenship, revealing that she has Irish grandparents.\n\n“That’s what’s going on and that’s where I’ve been and what I’ve been doing,” she added. “Although I was never someone who I thought would move to another country, that’s what I decided would be the best for myself and my 12-year-old child.”\n\n“I miss my other kids. I miss my friends. I miss many things about life there at home and I’m trying to find a home here in this beautiful country and when it is safe for all citizens to have equal rights there in America, that’s when we will consider coming back,” she said.\n\nO’Donnell said that it’s been “heartbreaking to see what’s happening politically” and hard for her personally.\n\n“The personal is political, as we all know,” she added.\n\nShe said that she’s met a lot of people in Ireland and everyone has been “friendly.”\n\n“I just felt like we needed to take care of ourselves and make some hard decisions and follow through. And now as we’re getting settled, I was ready to post this and to tell everybody what’s been going on,” O’Donnell explained in her over nine-minute video.\n\nO’Donnell encouraged Americans “to protest, to demand that we follow our constitution and our country.”\n\n“And not a king, not a man, and we don’t have cruelty as part of our governing style,” she added.\n\n“Protect your sanity is all I can say. Protect your sanity as much as you can, and try not to swim in the chaos if possible, but I know it’s nearly impossible when you’re there in the middle of it,” she said to her fans.\n\n“And I think about everyone every day, and the United States of America. And I am hoping that we can turn things around, counting on you, all of you, to do what’s right. And I think deep down inside, we all know what that is,” O’Donnell concluded.\n\nO’Donnell is not the first American celebrity to discuss the idea of moving abroad after U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January.\n\nIn February, director James Cameron said his New Zealand citizenship is “imminent” and hinted at plans to relocate to the country permanently.\n\nAccording to the Guardian, Cameron has long been vocal about his plans to live in New Zealand and Trump’s current presidency, which he described as “horrifying” and “like watching a car crash over and over again,” is a recent catalyst.\n\n“I see it as a turn away from everything decent,” he said of the Trump administration. “America doesn’t stand for anything if it doesn’t stand for what it has historically stood for. It becomes a hollow idea, and I think they’re hollowing it out as fast as they can for their own benefit.”\n\nEllen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi moved from the United States to England in November, a decision reportedly motivated by Trump’s presidential victory.\n\nThe Wrap spoke to sources close to the comedian, 67, and Arrested Development star, 52, who told the outlet the couple is likely to “never” return to the U.S. on a permanent basis.\n\nSeparate sources, speaking with TMZ, said the married couple decided to “get the hell out” of the U.S. immediately following Trump’s victory over Kamala Harris.\n\n— With files from Global News’ Rachel Goodman and Michelle Butterfield","summary":"'Try not to swim in the chaos if possible, but I know it's nearly impossible when you're there in the middle of it,\" Rosie O'Donnell said to her fans.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11076799/rosie-o-donnell-confirms-move-to-ireland-leaving-u-s/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/rosie-odonnell-leaves-united-states-ireland.jpg?quality=85&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 20:20:33","author":"Katie Scott","authors":["Katie Scott"],"language":"en","source_country":"ca","sentiment":0.192},{"id":299175846,"title":"\"This is dangerous\": DOJ attorney was dismissed after opposing restoration of Gibson's gun rights","text":"A former pardons attorney for the Department of Justice says she was dismissed from her role after she opposed the restoration of actor Mel Gibson's gun rights.\n\nGibson, a prominent Tinseltown conservative who was recently nominated by President Donald Trump to serve as an ambassador to Hollywood, lost the ability to legally own firearms following a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction.\n\nElizabeth Oyer told the New York Times that Gibson's case came up as part of a wider effort to restore gun rights to people who had been convicted of crimes. Felons are barred from purchasing or owning handguns under federal law. Oyer told the outlet that she helped craft a list of nine people who could potentially have their rights restored, basing it on the age of their convictions and likelihood of committing another crime. Oyer said she was approached directly and asked to add Gibson's name to the list.\n\n\"This is dangerous. This isn’t political — this is a safety issue,\" Oyer shared.\n\nGibson pleaded no contest to battery of his ex-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva in 2011. If that name rings a bell, it's likely because of an infamous tape where Gibson hurled sexist and racist remarks at the mother of one of his children. That leaked audio, along with an antisemitic rant the actor went on while being arrested for driving under the influence, dimmed the star of the one-time blockbuster draw.

Both of those organizations are part of a network of nonprofit groups funded and controlled by the Soros family. The Soros family has long played a key role in financing both the Democratic Party and the broader progressive movement.\n\nDemocracy PAC, run by George Soros’s son, Alex, spent $67.5 million during the 2024 election cycle working to elect Democrats to Congress and the White House. George and Alex Soros personally donated millions of dollars to fund former President Joe Biden’s and former Vice President Kamala Harris’s failed presidential bids. Direct political spending aside, Soros’s nongovernmental organization empire also serves as a vital financial lifeline to nonprofit groups working to oppose the Trump administration’s agenda through coordinated protests, public messaging campaigns, and lawfare.\n\nRhetoric employed by CIVICUS largely mirrors that of the individuals and organizations funding it.\n\n“The Trump Administration seems hellbent on dismantling the system of checks and balances which are the pillars of a democratic society,” interim CIVICUS co-Secretary General Mandeep Tiwana said in a press release. “Restrictive Executive Orders, unjustifiable institutional cutbacks, and intimidation tactics through threatening pronouncements by senior officials in the Administration are creating an atmosphere to chill democratic dissent, a cherished American ideal.”\n\nBill Gates is another major Democratic donor who has pumped considerable funding into CIVICUS, with tax forms showing that his charitable foundation contributed roughly $1.5 million to the group in 2018. Gates’s political bent is clear, as the Microsoft co-founder donated $50 million to support the Harris campaign during the 2024 election, according to the New York Times. The Gates Foundation has also long provided financial support to left-of-center groups such as Planned Parenthood.\n\nAfter receiving funding from Soros and Gates, CIVICUS put out a report in 2021 praising the U.S. for electing Harris as the nation’s first female vice president.\n\n“At the year’s end, the USA elected its first-ever female vice-president, Kamala Harris, who was also the first African-American and Asian-American to hold the office,” the report reads. “This happened in no small part in reaction to an outgoing administration that had become the paradigmatic example of toxic macho leadership.”\n\nCIVICUS’s affinity for Harris comes as one of the organization’s top funders is run by allies of the former vice president.\n\nThe Ford Foundation poured roughly $8.3 million into CIVICUS between 2020 and 2023, according to tax documents.\n\nDarren Walker, the foundation’s president, has a long history of hobnobbing with Harris. Walker met Harris one-on-one in April 2021, attended an event at the then-vice president’s private residence in October 2022, and, in fall 2023, dined privately with Harris and her husband, according to White House visitor logs and media reports.\n\nBeyond socializing, Walker and Harris collaborated frequently through public-private partnerships. The Ford Foundation collaborated with the Biden-Harris administration on artificial intelligence initiatives, community violence prevention, economic development, and in distributing tens of millions of dollars for technology programs.\n\nLaurene Powell Jobs, a Democratic megadonor and close friend of Harris, sits on the Ford Foundation’s board of trustees. The New York Times described the relationship between the two as a “genuine friendship built on a shared political philosophy, an interest in art and culture and their mutual trials as women in the public spotlight.”\n\nIn addition to being led by left-of-center individuals, the Ford Foundation is also a major funder of liberal activist and political organizations. In recent years, the foundation has pumped tens of millions of dollars into left-of-center think tanks such as the Center for American Progress and New America, legal advocacy groups that often challenge conservative politicians, abortion-rights organizations, and groups linked to mass protests, among other liberal causes.\n\nCIVICUS did not respond to a request for comment.","summary":"Media outlets began circulating news this week that the United States had been added to a “global human rights watchlist” due to President Donald Trump’s policies.

So while Trump busies himself rolling out Manifest Destiny 2.0 instead of lowering the cost of living like he campaigned on, Democrats must obstruct these efforts with a plan and a purpose. Every. Single. Day. We start by taking a page from U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell’s late 2008/early 2009 playbook who, alongside then-House GOP Whip Eric Cantor, hatched an obstructionist strategy in secret to deploy unified Republican resistance to any action proposed or supported by then newly-elected President Barack Obama. McConnell touted the coordinated obstruction as the sure-fire path to resurrect the GOP, and why not? If you obstruct every effort by the party in power to implement its policies, you can then campaign successfully on the promise of overcoming the gridlock you have personally created. McConnell’s strategy led to massive 2010 GOP midterm gains in the House and Senate and locked in state chamber majorities for decades. It also laid the foundation for Trump’s meteoric political rise, enabling the creation of the MAGA movement to energize a loyal Republican base. The strategy worked because Republicans kept the message to voters simple: Where are the jobs? U.S. Rep. John Boehner held a press conference on the first Friday of every month – coinciding with the release of monthly jobs data – to ask this question. Meanwhile, House Republicans passed numerous so-called “jobs” bills knowing full well that their obstruction-first strategy deemed them dead on arrival in the Democrat-controlled Senate, effectively creating a paper trail that established their commitment to job creation without ever requiring any proof of sincerity. Democrats, it’s our turn. Not only are grocery prices not coming down, but Trump’s style of government by executive order means tariffs – especially the 25% levied on foreign steel and aluminum – will boost costs to U.S. consumers through pass-along pricing on everything from vehicles and household appliances to bicycles and beer. This engineered financial squeezing of the American people should headline every press conference, podcast appearance and press gaggle until the masses understand that the administration they elected to ease their economic suffering never had any intentions of making anything in this country great again except its war chest and the bottom lines of its billionaire donors. In 2009, Republican obstruction succeeded because it focused on the manufactured notion that Obama’s elitist policies cost Americans jobs and wealth. The approach appealed to hard-working, cash-strapped voters then, and it will resonate with them again, but only if we flood every channel available. Trump has no economic plan. Prices on everyday items continue increasing. Tariffs on foreign goods will drive up the costs of everything from fruit and liquor to housing starts and commercial developments. Most importantly, though, Trump floods the zone 24/7 with lies, and we cannot leave anything to chance. If we start picking and choosing which lies to challenge, we risk another 50 creeping onto podcasts and into Instagram posts – like kudzu invading your garden – making them more difficult to debunk. Democrats need to marshal all the conviction, toughness and fight they can muster to remind voters that absolute power corrupts absolutely, and whether you call it obstruction or resistance, our bold actions in the coming weeks and months are the strongest line of defense remaining between the American people and a tyrannical state hellbent on defrauding them of their inalienable rights.

Katie Porter announced her bid for governor of California on Tuesday via an Instagram video saying the Golden State needs \"a little bit of hope and a whole lot of grit, fresh blood and new ideas [and] leaders with the backbone to fight for what’s right.\" Porter, 51, served three terms in Congress – winning her Orange County seat by upsetting GOP Rep. Mimi Walters in 2018. She ran unsuccessfully for the Senate seat now held by Sen. Adam Schiff, D–Calif. – and her district is now represented by Dave Min, a Democrat. The former congresswoman was born in Fort Dodge, Iowa, and grew up on a farm before moving to the Pacific coast. Gov. Gavin Newsom is term-limited, though all eyes in California are on whether former Vice President Kamala Harris also jumps into the race. PORTER DENIES FIRING STAFFER FOR CATCHING COVID-19 AS TEXT MESSAGES SURFACE AND GO VIRAL Porter told the Los Angeles Times that a Harris bid could clear the left flank of those assembled thus far. \"If Vice President Harris were to choose to run, I am certain that that would have a near field-clearing effect on the Democratic side,\" Porter said. Harris is said to be seriously considering a run in Sacramento after losing the 2024 sweeps. A source close to Harris previously told Fox News Digital the ex-veep has told allies she will decide by the end of summer on whether to launch a gubernatorial campaign. The Times also described Porter as a prolific fundraiser, while the former lawmaker’s gregarious nature was projected to make inroads among Californians upset at President Donald Trump’s election. In her announcement, Porter referenced Trump and alleged he would seek to enrich himself and his circle while in the White House. California has a unique \"jungle primary\" system where the two top vote-getters, regardless of party, will face off in the general. Sometimes that results in two Democrats competing in November. In Schiff’s case, former MLB star Steve Garvey gained enough Republican support to challenge the Burbank Democrat—only to strike out in the end. Porter’s entry also brings with it her colorful history in the House of Representatives. Sasha Georgiades, a Wounded Warrior fellow who had worked in Porter’s office, alleged she had made rude and racist comments to staff and \"ridiculed people for reporting sexual harassment.\" KATIE PORTER USED ‘RACIST LANGUAGE’, RIDICULED PEOPLE FOR REPORTING SEXUAL HARASSMENT, EX-STAFFER CLAIMS Georgiades also said that Porter ridiculed people after they had reported sexual harassment in her office as well as \"made fun of individuals whose parents passed away from COVID.\" \"Basically told the individual to grow up,\" Georgiades said regarding the case of a staffer who had reported sexual harassment in Porter’s office. Reports also surfaced in late 2022 that Porter \"made multiple staffers cry\" and that one staffer was allegedly fired after she and the lawmaker caught COVID-19. \"Sasha— I cannot allow you back in the office, given your failure to follow office policies,\" Porter wrote the next day on July 9, in texts shared on a \"Dear White Staffers\" X page and previously reported by Fox News Digital. \"Cody will be in touch about having your personal effects shipped or delivered to your home, and will lay out your remote work schedule and responsibilities for your last few weeks.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Porter reportedly denied the allegations at the time. Porter also wore a \"Batgirl\" costume to the House of Representatives while lawmakers were voting on Trump’s first impeachment on Oct. 31, 2019 – Halloween. Other top names include Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa on the Democratic side and Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco as the first major Republican -- amid a dozen or so candidates total.

As I noted in a previous On TAP, a VA inspector was scheduled to come out to his home two Mondays ago to approve the setup and the funding. Instead, he called on that Monday to say he wouldn’t be coming, since he’d been fired over the weekend.\n\nHe was far from alone. Already, at least 6,000 VA employees have been shown—make that, booted from—the door, and Doug Collins, Donald Trump’s designated VA secretary and decimator, has pledged to discharge another 80,000 or so. As more than 20 percent of VA workers are veterans themselves, that makes it likely that 20,000 more veterans will be Musked out of work. And there are hundreds of thousands of other veterans at work for the federal government, a sizable share of whom are also slated to be terminated.\n\nNot surprisingly, these firings and reductions in service—both the threatened and the already done—have alarmed veterans’ organizations. Al Lipphardt, the national commander of Veterans of Foreign Wars, called on his members to tell their congressional representatives to “stop the bleeding.” As Steve Early and Rebecca Gordon have noted, calling out a Republican president is a departure from normal VFW practice, as its members tend to align themselves with conservative causes and elected officials. Exit polls from last November’s presidential election showed nearly two-thirds of voting vets chose Donald Trump over Kamala Harris.\n\nBut rank-and-file veterans haven’t always been so aligned. In 1932, at the bottom of the Great Depression, with 25 percent of the workforce officially unemployed and probably an equal share at work for fewer hours and reduced pay, roughly 30,000 World War I veterans, many with their wives and children, came to Washington—a lot of them riding the rails in boxcars—to demand their bonus. In the 1920s, Congress had voted to provide Great War vets with bonuses of several thousand dollars, payable near the end of the ’30s. 1932 wasn’t the end of the ’30s, but tens of thousands of vets were at the end of their rope, homeless and hungry. They asked President Hoover to move the payment date up so they wouldn’t be reduced to selling pencils on street corners.\n\nWhen Hoover said no, they stayed in place, occupying some empty office buildings but mainly camped out on an open field across the Anacostia River from the Capitol. Eventually, Hoover decided they had to go, and ordered the Army—both cavalry and armored units, under the direction of Army Chief of Staff Douglas MacArthur—to clear them out forcibly. The troops, led by MacArthur on a white horse, did just that, to the general horror of the nation.\n\nWe’ve reached that stage in the Trump-Musk usurpation of constitutionally limited powers that demonstrations are now popping up on the National Mall—last weekend, for instance, from scientists concerned about the defunding of research and the cutbacks at agencies like the National Institutes of Health and even the federal weather bureau. My sense is that if any group can assemble on the Mall and protest the wanton assaults on public services, research, and employment and win widespread, bipartisan support, it’s America’s veterans. I’m not suggesting they camp out until the current madness is halted, but for some of them, at least, it wouldn’t be a bad idea.\n\nRemember that what ended Joe McCarthy’s drunken reign of terror was his accusations that the Army was honeycombed with communists, and that, therefore, the top brass, beginning with George Marshall, should be unceremoniously sacked.

Despite her defeat, many Democrats still view her favorably, blaming her loss on other factors, such as former President Joe Biden's late decision to drop out of the race. It could give her a platform to implement key campaign priorities, and potentially a stepping stone for a future presidential bid.What to KnowEven though the election is more than a year and a half away, more than a dozen candidates are already running in hopes of establishing an early connection with voters in the Golden State.Porter on Tuesday became the latest Democrat to join. She is a former member of Congress from Orange County who served in the House of Representatives from 2019 to 2024. She left the House for an unsuccessful Senate bid which she lost to fellow Democrat Adam Schiff.Early polls suggest Porter would hold a slight lead over other candidates so long as Harris stays out.California uses a non-partisan primary system. This means that in the primary, the two candidates who receive the most votes, regardless of their political affiliation, advance to the general election.A Capitol Weekly poll, conducted from February 3 to February 7 among 1,200 registered voters, showed Porter receiving the most support of any candidate in a race without Harris.Twenty-six percent of respondents said they would vote for Porter in the primary. Republican businessman John Cox placed second at 21 percent, while all other candidates polled in the single digits.But when Harris was included in the poll, the race becomes scrambled. The former vice president takes a lead over Porter, with 23 percent of respondents saying they'd support the former vice president. Cox again placed second with 21 percent, while Porter placed third with 16 percent. Other candidates remained in the single digits.An Emerson College poll, conducted among 469 registered voters from February 10 to February 11, showed similar dynamics.Notably, the Emerson poll only included Democratic candidates. While it doesn't account for Republican and third-party dynamics, it's still useful to show how Democrats are feeling about each candidate. California is a deep blue state, so whichever candidate Democrats end up rallying behind would be the favorite next November.Porter said in December that Harris entering the race would have a \"near field-clearing effect\" for Democrats, but did not say whether a Harris run would inform her own decision. For her part, Harris has reportedly put a self-imposed deadline to decide by the end of the summer.Longtime Democratic strategist Darry A. Sragow told Newsweek that early polls are \"essentially meaningless,\" and that it's too early to know exactly what will happen.\"All they are measuring is voters' familiarity with a particular candidate,\" he said. \"They don't begin to suggest what would happen if there is a competitive campaign. In a competitive campaign, voters are going to hear a lot of negative information about candidates as well of positive information.\"Harris and Porter are both well known to California voters, he said, which explains their early advantages.If Harris enters the race and clears most of the field except for Porter, it's \"going to be difficult to predict the outcome,\" Sragow said. While Harris has held statewide office in the state before, Porter is likely to be a candidate who has a \"substantial fundraising base,\" key to competing in a large state like California.\"If it becomes a Porter-Harris race, maybe with some other people in there, based on early polling you'd go 'Well, Vice President Harris would win,\" he said. \"But you cant be so sure.\"Tom Hogen-Esch, a political science professor at California State University—Northridge, told Newsweek that Porter's chances \"really depend on the mood of the electorate.\"\"If this race was taking place four years ago, you could easily imagine Katie Porter and another Democrat – for example Kamala Harris – finishing in the top two and then meeting in the general election,\" he said. \"But a lot has changed in a short period of time and one wonders whether the electorate will be in the mood for two progressive Democrats in the runoff.\"He said Harris would likely take a \"more centrist approach\" in a potential gubernatorial campaign, while Porter would likely run as a progressive.Hogen-Esch said questions still remain about whether a candidate from the center-right, such as Rick Caruso, will emerge. Caruso, a billionaire developer, gained name recognition after his 2022 Los Angeles mayoral campaign, which he lost to Karen Bass. Caruso has since been outspoken about Bass' leadership in the wake of the fires that devastated parts of Los Angeles earlier this year.\"My sense is that there is definitely a pathway to the general election by running from the center right in this race which might end up squeezing out a popular Democrat on the left,\" he said.Sragow said whether Caruso runs is one of many \"unknown\" factors in the election, but he has access to funds that would allow him to compete.What Has Kamala Harris Said About Running for Governor?Harris has been fairly quiet about what her next political move could be amid speculation about a potential gubernatorial run. She has also been floated as a potential presidential candidate for 2028.In January, she shrugged off questions about a possible gubernatorial run while visiting areas impacted by the L.A. fires.\"I have been home for two weeks and three days. My plans are to be in touch with my community, to be in touch with the leaders and figure out what I can do to support them,\" she said.Harris has said after her defeat in November she is \"staying in this fight.\" Politico later reported on Harris' intention to make a decision by the end of the summer in remarks at a pre-Oscars party in Los Angeles.She had an extensive carer in California politics before becoming vice president, previously serving as San Francisco district attorney, attorney general and senator.What People Are SayingCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta to Politico: \"Her name recognition, her favorables, her ability to run a successful campaign would have the impact of clearing the field on the Democratic side. If anyone wants to stay in, will I tell them, 'You should leave because she's clearing the field?' Absolutely not. They can run. I think they'll lose, and I will support her.\"Porter in her campaign announcement: \"What California needs now is a little bit of hope and whole lot of grit. Fresh blood and new ideas. And leaders with the backbone to fight for what's right. That's why I'm running for governor.\"What Happens NextCalifornians will head to their polls for the state's primary in June 2026, and more candidates are expected to make announcements over the next year or so. Cook Political Report classifies California's governor race as Solid Democratic, meaning it is \"not considered competitive and [is] not likely to become closely contested.\"But the state's politics are changing, due in part to what is widely seen as the failures of Democrat-run cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles. California Democrats have about 18 months to change that narrative before voters head to the polls.","summary":"Former Representative Katie Porter jumped into California's gubernatorial race on Tuesday, while the former VP is biding her time on a decision.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/california-governor-race-katie-porter-polls-kamala-harris-2043056","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2604946/california-governor-race-update.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 18:49:57","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.143},{"id":299122346,"title":"Ex-Rep.

Katie Porter — who once allegedly dumped “steaming’’ mashed potatoes on her then-hubby’s head — is now vying to replace Gov. Gavin Newsom, calling herself a scrappy foe to President Trump.\n\nThe California Democrat launched her campaign in a Tuesday video posted on X that did not attack Newsom, who is term-limited from serving again, but claimed current elected leaders such as Trump were just feeding “bulls–t” to her state’s constituents about the policies driving their high cost of living.\n\n“I first ran for office to hold Trump accountable. I feel that same call to serve now to stop him from hurting Californians,” Porter, 51, said in the footage, referencing her first congressional campaign in 2018.\n\n“As governor, I won’t ever back down when Trump hurts Californians — whether he’s holding up disaster relief, attacking our rights or our communities or screwing over working families to benefit himself and his cronies,” she said.\n\nTrump, 78, threatened but never did withhold Federal Emergency Management Agency relief for California while claiming that Newsom’s climate policies were halting water from reaching the dry, fire-ravaged southern regions of the state.\n\nPorter, a single mother of three, also made a point in the video to boast that she “actually knows the price of groceries.”\n\nHer former spouse, Matthew Hoffman, alleged in divorce proceedings nearly two years ago that she verbally berated him, chucked “toys, books and other objects” at him over their decade-long marriage — and once dumped scalding-hot mashed potatoes on his head.\n\nDuring a heated marital fight in 2006, Porter mocked Hoffman for not being able to “read the f–king instructions” while preparing dinner — and later carried over a “ceramic bowl of steaming hot potatoes and dumped it on my head, burning my scalp,” according to April 2023 court filings in California.\n\nPorter “routinely” called Hoffman a “f–king idiot” and “f–king incompetent,” too, the divorce filings say.\n\nShe also didn’t let him him “have a cell phone because she said, ‘You’re too f–king dumb to operate it,’ ” the papers say.\n\nThe then-congresswoman sought a restraining order against Hoffman after the filing. A judge granted her request, as well as protective custody for their three children.\n\nIn the video announcement, she went on to expound on other economic, climate-related, housing and health-care challenges facing residents in the Golden State — before heaping blame on “dangerous leaders” in Washington, DC.\n\nWhen Porter delivers her line about “dangerous leaders,” footage is shown of Trump, tech billionaire Elon Musk and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).\n\nThose figures were followed by those whom Porter labels “corrupt enablers” of the Trump agenda, including former Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who has been succeeded by Sen. John Thune (R-SD).\n\nPorter, who served three terms in the US House and also has worked as a bankruptcy-law professor, then twice promised to channel her “new ideas” to “make Californians’ lives better” — without listing any novel plans.\n\n“I’ll work with anybody, and I’ll say no to anybody, because I have never been for sale — and I never will be,” says Porter, who drew attention to herself in the House chamber during a contested Republican speakership vote in January 2023 by thumbing through a copy of “The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F–k.”\n\nShe enters a crowded Democratic primary field for the gubernatorial contest that includes Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and California Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, after having lost her race for the US Senate last year.\n\nSen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) defeated her in that primary fight by more than 1 million votes. Porter erupted later about “an onslaught of billionaires spending millions to rig this election.”\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is also rumored to be weighing a run for the Golden State governor’s mansion, with a Capitol Weekly poll last month showing her 2 percentage points in the lead.","summary":"During a heated marital fight in 2006, Porter mocked her then-hubby for not being able to “read the f--king instructions” while preparing dinner -- and later carried over a “ceramic bowl of steaming hot potatoes and dumped it on my head, burning my scalp,” according to April 2023 court filings in California.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/11/us-news/ex-rep-katie-porter-enters-race-to-succeed-gov-gavin-newsom/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/100273461.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/y6atjEBu-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-11 18:27:52","author":"Josh Christenson","authors":["Josh Christenson"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":299147194,"title":"Barron Trump for President?

The teenager was endlessly praised on social media for being “well-raised” and “well-mannered.”\n\nRepublicans and Democrats equally praised the teenager, especially for his “classy” gesture towards Joe Biden and Kamala Harris on the day. Barron was seen walking up to the two to greet them and shake hands with them. The people on the internet seemed to be in awe of the teenager after the gesture.\n\n“Barron Trump just shook hands with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris This kid will be our President one day. Bet on it,” one commented. It didn’t take long for the others to jump into the discussion. Trump supporters strongly supported the possibility of Barron being elected as the President someday.\n\nA few netizens even claimed that the teenager was “born to lead.” Things really started picking up when somebody started selling merch supporting Barron’s hypothetical Presidential run. Badged that read, “Barron Trump President 2044” went up on sale soon after the inauguration ceremony.\n\nThe only problem with Barron Trump’s hypothetical run, you ask?

Christopher Thevanesan insists he was a “model employee” but faced a “hostile work environment” because he is heterosexual and “gender-typical.” The ex-manager did not reveal the exact details for why he was fired in 2022, but claims his supervisors were hiding “the real reason for doing so.” Now, he’s going after both Starbucks and his LGBTQ+ former coworkers at the Rochester, New York location in a lawsuit that says he sustained “physical, emotional, economic, and psychological damages.” Thevanesan’s attorney added that his heterosexuality was “weaponized” against him. Starbucks did not immediately respond to request for comment. Thevanesan’s case comes only weeks after Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s parallel lawsuit claiming Starbucks has “systemic racial, sexual, and sexual orientation discrimination” because of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. It also echos the recent case of Marlean Ames, who claims she didn’t get a promotion at the Ohio Department of Youth Services because her organization chose a less qualified lesbian candidate. Ames is white, straight, and cisgender. Her case was reopened by the U.S. Supreme Court and a victory could allow more straight employees to allege discrimination.

PRESIDENTThe Daily BeastPublished 03.11.25 1:57PM EDT Lisa Marie David/Reuters Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested Tuesday on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant accusing him of “crimes against humanity” for a brutal anti-drug campaign in which thousands were killed. Duterte, 79, was taken into custody at Manila airport on his return from a trip to Hong Kong, CNN reported. He questioned the legality of the ICC warrant, saying in a video posted by his daughter: “What is the law and what is the crime that I committed?” Known as “Asia’s Trump” for his bombastic style, Duterte earned global notoriety for a drug crackdown in which at least 6,000 people were killed, and perhaps many more. A statement from Interpol’s Manila office said it received the ICC’s arrest warrant on Tuesday morning. While Duterte has denied extrajudicial killings while in office from 2016 to 2022, he admitted ordering police to shoot resisting suspects. Human Rights Watch’s Bryony Lau called his detention “a critical step for accountability.” Despite Duterte withdrawing the Philippines from the ICC, the court maintains jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.‘s administration indicated its willingness to cooperate with the ICC. Duterte’s former spokesperson labeled the arrest “unlawful detention.”The Beast used specially trained AI to summarize the original source material cited in this article.

A federal Appeals Court has ordered the school to remove the marker. Mike Simons/Getty Images The Texas Senate intends to pass legislation that will require the displaying of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms, the Dallas Morning News reported. Senate Bill 10 (SB 10) would require elementary and secondary schools to display the Ten Commandments on 16-inch by 20-inch posters that are legible from any corner of the classroom. All 20 of the state’s Republican senators signed on to the proposal, which would allow schools to use district funds to buy copies or accept donations of displays that depict the Ten Commandments. According to Sen. Phil King, SB 10’s goal is to provide “moral clarity” to students and promote the nation’s “heritage.” “Louisiana has already passed legislation requiring the display of Ten Commandments in public schools, and at least 14 other states have introduced similar legislation,” King said at a committee hearing on the bill. “It is time for Texas to pass SB 10 to bring back the historical tradition of recognizing our national heritage.” Ultimately, King said he believes the bill could compel the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a wider ruling on the issue.Read it at The Dallas Morning NewsADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTShop with ScoutedHP’s Newest Laser Printer Offers Powerful, Reliable Performance Without the Headaches PAPER CHASEScouted StaffPublished 01.14.25 9:07PM EST HP Scouted selects products independently.

The actor revealed that she had been warned Che had written a “vagina joke” for Jost to read about her live on-air, but when she realized it involved a Costco roast beef sandwich, she thought, “No, Michael!” What made the whole thing “so intense” was that she was backstage at Studio 8H watching the bit live with lights and a camera in her face to capture her reaction. “They were waiting for me to react. I felt insane. I was like, I think I’m going to faint,” she recalled, adding that she and Jost laughed about the whole thing when they finally got in bed at 4 a.m.: “I was like, ‘My nerves are shot.’ And Colin said, ‘Me too.’”Read it at InStyleADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT6X-Rated Video Mistakenly Played at Ex-Colombian President’s TrialSTRIPPED...OF LIBERTYLeigh Kimmins ReporterPublished 03.11.25 12:58PM EDT Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe speaks to the press after attending his first criminal trial hearing, pleading not guilty to procedural fraud and witness bribery charges, in Bogota, Colombia February 10, 2025.

Prosecutor Marlene Orjuela instigated the embarrassing double blunder as she tried to pull up audio files on her laptop of conversations between two lawyers also implicated in the ongoing trial. The faux pas was caught on a livestream of the trial. Uribe, who is charged with bribery, witness tampering and procedural fraud, looked unimpressed as the whole court—including the judge—burst into laughter. “Your Honor, my apologies. We didn’t foresee that this would happen,” Orjuela said, chuckling after showing the short man dancing merrily. “My apologies, Your Honor, but, well… it’s just that…” she mumbled as the trial turned farcical after the second clip, that appeared to be from a porn site, played. It showed an AI-doctored female in a swimsuit dancing and revealing her buttocks and vagina. Uribe, who denies all charges, likely did not find the slip-up humorous as he faces 12 years in jail.

Authorities are warning that as many as 30,000 more residents could be in danger and should self-evacuate. The 12,300-foot-high volcano, one of Central America’s most active, began its latest eruption late Sunday night with no immediate casualties reported, according to the Associated Press. Schools near the volcano have been closed, and a crucial road has been blocked due to ash. Isaac García, 43, who fled with his family, said, “We were a little worried because a few years ago the volcano became active.” The threat of destructive ash and debris looms large, with the flow of volcanic material expected to intensify, according to the national disaster agency.The Beast used specially trained AI to summarize the original source material cited in this article.

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.If you’re looking for effective anti-aging skincare formulas that don’t cost the sum of a monthly mortgage payment, take a cue from reality TV star Bethenny Frankel. Frankel, who has amassed quite the following on TikTok over the years, uses the platform to showcase her favorite products, including both luxury and drugstore formulas. One of her favorite brands for skincare and cosmetics is No7—specifically, its Future Renew collection. Each formula in the line is affordably priced under $50 but, according to Frankel, looks, feels, and performs like higher-end counterparts. No7 Future Renew Damage Reversal SerumSee At No7$40One of her favorites is the Future Renew Damage Reversal Eye Serum. The lightweight anti-aging serum is formulated with Pepticology, the brand’s new and patent-pending peptide technology. This technology is formulated to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while aiding in the skin’s natural repair process for a firmer, brighter, and smoother complexion. Frankel also notes that the wallet-friendly serum layers well with other skincare products (she uses it under her moisturizer), and it “plays well with makeup.”While skincare is always a worthy splurge (after all, our skin is our biggest organ), you don’t have to shell out $100+ for effective formulas that target the visible signs of aging.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT9Katie Porter Enters Race That Could Pit Her Against Kamala HarrisIT’S ONKenneal Patterson Breaking News InternPublished 03.11.25 12:20PM EDT Mario Tama/Getty Images A new candidate for California governor has entered the race as Kamala Harris decides whether she’s running—or entering the presidential race again. Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, who went viral for grilling Trump administration officials and using a “whiteboard of justice” to simplify their policies, is aiming to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom. She hasn’t included Harris in her campaign calculations, saying the former vice president would have a “field-clearing effect.” Her advisers added that Porter “wouldn’t run against Kamala... and likely none of the others will either.” But if Harris decides not to enter the race, Porter think she has a shot at governor, and she’s focusing her campaign on an anti-Trump agenda. “I won’t ever back down when Trump’s hurting Californians,” she said, adding that she’s running against “Big Oil, Big Banks or Big Pharma screwing people over.” Porter represented Orange County in the U.S. House for three terms. She was taught the political ropes by Elizabeth Warren—and even named her child after the Massachusetts senator.

The Tesla mogul said in a Fox Business interview Monday that he would dip into a pool of tech bros to reach his goal of adding 100 more DOGE workers to his existing 100-strong team. “Basically, it’s software people, information security software people and finance,” Musk said. “It’s basically, yes, finance and technology.” He added that his army is “pretty much” in every government department already. The Hill reported that some of his confirmed staffers have ties to his companies, Tesla and xAI, his artificial intelligence firm. Musk also repeated his heroic trope about saving America from so-called fraud. “The goal here is: Let’s not have America go bankrupt with waste and fraud,” Musk told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. “So that’s what I’m here for.” It comes after a report emerged that Musk’s demands for government cuts were met with pushback from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a tense Cabinet meeting last week.

Christopher Thevanesan insists he was a “model employee” but faced a “hostile work environment” because he is heterosexual and “gender-typical.” The ex-manager did not reveal the exact details for why he was fired in 2022, but claims his supervisors were hiding “the real reason for doing so.” Now, he’s going after both Starbucks and his LGBTQ+ former coworkers at the Rochester, New York location in a lawsuit that says he sustained “physical, emotional, economic, and psychological damages.” Thevanesan’s attorney added that his heterosexuality was “weaponized” against him. Starbucks did not immediately respond to request for comment. Thevanesan’s case comes only weeks after Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s parallel lawsuit claiming Starbucks has “systemic racial, sexual, and sexual orientation discrimination” because of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. It also echos the recent case of Marlean Ames, who claims she didn’t get a promotion at the Ohio Department of Youth Services because her organization chose a less qualified lesbian candidate. Ames is white, straight, and cisgender. Her case was reopened by the U.S. Supreme Court and a victory could allow more straight employees to allege discrimination.

A federal Appeals Court has ordered the school to remove the marker. Mike Simons/Getty Images The Texas Senate intends to pass legislation that will require the displaying of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms, the Dallas Morning News reported. Senate Bill 10 (SB 10) would require elementary and secondary schools to display the Ten Commandments on 16-inch by 20-inch posters that are legible from any corner of the classroom. All 20 of the state’s Republican senators signed on to the proposal, which would allow schools to use district funds to buy copies or accept donations of displays that depict the Ten Commandments. According to Sen. Phil King, SB 10’s goal is to provide “moral clarity” to students and promote the nation’s “heritage.” “Louisiana has already passed legislation requiring the display of Ten Commandments in public schools, and at least 14 other states have introduced similar legislation,” King said at a committee hearing on the bill. “It is time for Texas to pass SB 10 to bring back the historical tradition of recognizing our national heritage.” Ultimately, King said he believes the bill could compel the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a wider ruling on the issue.Read it at The Dallas Morning NewsADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTShop with ScoutedHP’s Newest Laser Printer Offers Powerful, Reliable Performance Without the Headaches PAPER CHASEScouted StaffPublished 01.14.25 9:07PM EST HP Scouted selects products independently.

I was like—it was so gross. It was really gross. And, like, old-school gross,” Johansson told InStyle as part of a new profile pegged to her role in the upcoming Jurassic World: Rebirth. The actor revealed that she had been warned Che had written a “vagina joke” for Jost to read about her live on-air, but when she realized it involved a Costco roast beef sandwich, she thought, “No, Michael!” What made the whole thing “so intense” was that she was backstage at Studio 8H watching the bit live with lights and a camera in her face to capture her reaction. “They were waiting for me to react. I felt insane. I was like, I think I’m going to faint,” she recalled, adding that she and Jost laughed about the whole thing when they finally got in bed at 4 a.m.: “I was like, ‘My nerves are shot.’ And Colin said, ‘Me too.’”Read it at InStyleADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT6X-Rated Video Mistakenly Played at Ex-Colombian President’s TrialSTRIPPED...OF LIBERTYLeigh Kimmins ReporterPublished 03.11.25 12:58PM EDT Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe speaks to the press after attending his first criminal trial hearing, pleading not guilty to procedural fraud and witness bribery charges, in Bogota, Colombia February 10, 2025. REUTERS/Nathalia Angarita REUTERS An AI-enhanced video of a scantily clad woman stripping as well as a bizarre clip of a short man dancing with a bottle of liquor were accidentally played during Colombian ex-president Alvaro Uribe‘s historic bribery trial. Prosecutor Marlene Orjuela instigated the embarrassing double blunder as she tried to pull up audio files on her laptop of conversations between two lawyers also implicated in the ongoing trial. The faux pas was caught on a livestream of the trial. Uribe, who is charged with bribery, witness tampering and procedural fraud, looked unimpressed as the whole court—including the judge—burst into laughter. “Your Honor, my apologies. We didn’t foresee that this would happen,” Orjuela said, chuckling after showing the short man dancing merrily. “My apologies, Your Honor, but, well… it’s just that…” she mumbled as the trial turned farcical after the second clip, that appeared to be from a porn site, played. It showed an AI-doctored female in a swimsuit dancing and revealing her buttocks and vagina. Uribe, who denies all charges, likely did not find the slip-up humorous as he faces 12 years in jail. The 72-year-old was president of Colombia between 2002 and 2010.

Steven Payne, a 37-year-old from Melbourne, was four or five weeks into a six-month vacation with his partner and their dog when he went surfing at the remote Wharton Beach, about an hour from Esperance. The fatal attack occurred on Monday, but authorities have yet to recover Payne’s remains, The Guardian reported. A witness captured drone footage of a shark swimming away from a cloud of blood near the beach and a surfboard with bite marks was found. “Our search is a recovery, not a rescue,” Senior Sgt. Christopher Taylor told reporters. Payne’s family is grappling with the loss, and the Esperance community is also in mourning. “The whole community of Esperance feels the pain,” Taylor said, noting that the area, some 500 miles south of Perth, has now experienced four shark-related fatalities since 2017.

Martha Stewart was aspirational; Rachael Ray was relatable. Each personality came at it from a different direction, but managed to connect with their audiences (because they were authentic) and in so doing, climbed to the top of the lifestyle mountain, respectively,” Eldrige said.\n\nHe continued, “Connection comes in two forms, but regardless of the path or direction, it remains the critical first step in any creative or marketing endeavor.”\n\nA lack of authenticity was one of the most pervasive complaints from critics who took issue with “With Love, Meghan” and Markle as its host, with some noting that the show’s setting was a contributing factor.\n\nThe show wasn’t filmed at the Montecito home that Markle shares with her husband Prince Harry, 40, and their children Prince Archie, 5, and Princess Lilibet, 3. In an interview with People magazine, Markle explained why she instead opted for the show to be filmed at a rental property in her neighborhood.\n\n“I wanted to protect that safe haven,” she told the outlet. “We’re a close-knit family, and I love those moments — putting Lili down for a nap, having lunch together, having sacred time together at the end of the day.”\n\n“Our kitchen is where Mama just cooks for the family, and with a crew of 80-plus people, that’s a lot of people to have in your house!” Markle added.\n\nBy contrast, Stewart’s iconic “Martha Stewart Living” show was initially filmed at her Turkey Hill Road home in Westport, Connecticut, before the production moved to Westport Digital Studios in Westport.\n\nProduction for Ray’s “The Rachael Ray Show” primarily took place at Chelsea Television Studios in New York City, though some episodes were filmed at the Food Network star’s house in Lake Luzerne, New York.\n\nWhile speaking to Fox News Digital, Eldridge emphasized the importance of authenticity for a show or brand.\n\n“Authenticity is like humidity — you can’t see it, but you can walk in a room and feel it,” he said. “It’s also critical for what Markle is trying to accomplish. Authenticity fosters relatability, which in turn creates likability, all of which are needed for marketability.”\n\nThe PR expert noted that the immense popularity of Markle’s late mother-in-law, Princess Diana, stemmed from her authenticity. \n\n“Connection comes from authenticity and relatability; the audience needs to see something of themselves in you,” Eldridge said. “The reason Diana was referred to as ‘The People’s Princess’ is because people across the U.K. felt a connection to her — they felt she was both ‘one of them’ and a princess nonetheless. It was a rare feat and a testament to Diana’s likability, but again, it all started with her authenticity and sense of relatability.”\n\nRyan McCormick, managing partner at Goldman McCormick PR, also shared his view on the comparisons between established lifestyle hosts including Stewart and Ray and those who, like Markle, are following in their footsteps.\n\n“One of the biggest comparable differences between the coupling of Rachel Ray and Martha Stewart and now Meghan Markle is how they communicate to their followers,” he said. “Ray and Stuart talk directly to the viewer at home, making them feel like they are the only person in the world (fostering a strong connection). Both are always teaching and providing value to their audiences.”\n\nWhile McCormick noted that “With Love, Meghan” is “beautifully filmed,” he said that Markle doesn’t “appear to be engaging with viewers.”\n\n“The duchess narrates what is happening in her life, and she particularly enjoys showing you visually appetizing dishes. However, she’s not revealing how you can make them (which Ray and Stuart do),” he said.\n\nMcCormick also shared his observation that Markle’s on-screen demeanor may have made it difficult for audiences to connect to her.\n\n“Not sure if it was intended, but it seems Markle appears guarded most of the time,” he said. “It can be challenging for a viewer to bond with an individual like this compared to one who is engaging and open.”\n\nIn the finale episode of “With Love, Meghan,” Markle was joined by Harry, her mother Doria Ragland and some of her closest friends as they celebrated the relaunch of her lifestyle brand “As Ever.”\n\nMarkle originally debuted her brand as “American Riviera Orchard,” but changed the name after facing trademark issues.\n\nIn an interview with People magazine, Markle hinted that her signature jam, made famous during the debut of American Riviera Orchard, will be among the products she’ll be launching via her brand in the spring. Products will be available on the brand’s official website, per the outlet.\n\nWhile speaking with Fox News Digital, Eldrige explained that Markle likely faces an uphill battle as she attempts to build her lifestyle empire.\n\n“It’s difficult; over the last 20 years, this has become an increasingly crowded space and there are few ‘fresh ideas’ from which to draw,” he said. “At this point, it’s less about talent or training, and more likability and charisma.”\n\n“The latter creates an additional hurdle for Markle to clear, due to her polarizing reputation and sagging Q score,” Eldridge added. “It’s like starting a cross-country road trip with a slow leak in one of your tires — you might make it, but what was already going to be a long, hard, trip just got that much trickier.”\n\nBoth Markle and Netflix announced Friday that “With Love, Meghan” will be returning for a second season, which has already been filmed. \n\n“Lettuce romaine calm… or not (!) because I’m thrilled to share that Season 2 of ‘With Love, Meghan’ is coming!” Markle wrote alongside a video shared on her Instagram Story. \n\nIn the clip, the duchess was wearing a white baseball cap embossed with “Lettuce romaine calm” in cursive on the front with the show’s title on the back. \n\nMarkle also teased the second season in a post that she uploaded on her Instagram page. She shared a video compilation of clips from the first season of “With Love, Meghan,” writing in the caption, “If you’re loving Season 1, just wait until you see the fun we cooked up on Season 2!”\n\n“Thanks for joining the party, and an endless thanks to the amazing team and crew who helped bring it all to life!’\n\nOn Friday, “With Love, Meghan” climbed to No. 5 on Netflix’s Top Ten Shows in the United States, but it dropped out of the list over the weekend.\n\nEldridge noted it was crucial that Markle succeed with her new endeavors but noted that her appeal to a broader audience might be limited, comparing the duchess’s fanbase to those of President Donald Trump and former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n“At this point, Markle is similar to both candidates who ran in the last presidential election,” he said. “They were loved by their core demos and despised by those outside of it, which means it really came down to a numbers game.”\n\nHe continued, “Make no mistake, Markle has a large, loyal, following, but just like at a baseball game, the boos usually stand out more than the cheers, so they often seem more unanimous — regardless of whether that’s true. Again, it will be a numbers game moving forward. Markle just needs to stay in the batter’s box, ignore the crowd, and manage to get on first base. She can’t afford another strike out.”\n\nMcCormick also used a baseball analogy as he emphasized that Markle needed to find a way to attract and retain a loyal viewership in order to emulate the success of Stewart and Ray.\n\n“People need to have a reason to emotionally invest in a show,” he said. “With Ray and Stuart, an individual can learn to prepare multiple dishes in each episode. They also laugh and feel like they’re spending time with a best friend. “\n\n“As things currently are, I don’t think Markle is offering a strong enough incentive to viewers to hang around,” McCormick addded. “At the same time, it wouldn’t be a bad idea to give her the benefit of the doubt, as even the most successful individuals didn’t hit home runs their first time at bat.”","summary":"Meghan Markle’s new Netflix show has drawn comparisons to the works of lifestyle guru Martha Stewart and celebrity chef Rachael Ray, but experts say the Duchess of Sussex still has a lot...","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/03/11/entertainment/meghan-markle-lacks-authenticity-of-martha-stewart-rachael-ray-experts/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/03/newspress-collage-27ltwqnbc-1741714240184.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1741699886&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xndh6KOP-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-03-11 17:31:30","author":"Fox News","authors":["Fox News"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.226},{"id":299113344,"title":"Thousands Evacuate as ‘Volcano of Fire’ Erupts","text":"1Fired Starbucks Manager: LGBTQ+ Co-Workers Harassed Me for Being StraightNO ALLIES HEREKenneal Patterson Breaking News InternUpdated 03.11.25 2:00PM EDT / Published 03.11.25 1:40PM EDT A customer sits in a Starbucks coffee shop in New York Keith Bedford/Reuters A fired Starbucks manager is suing the company and claiming he faced discrimination and harassment for being a straight man.

PRESIDENTThe Daily BeastPublished 03.11.25 1:57PM EDT Lisa Marie David/Reuters Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested Tuesday on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant accusing him of “crimes against humanity” for a brutal anti-drug campaign in which thousands were killed. Duterte, 79, was taken into custody at Manila airport on his return from a trip to Hong Kong, CNN reported. He questioned the legality of the ICC warrant, saying in a video posted by his daughter: “What is the law and what is the crime that I committed?” Known as “Asia’s Trump” for his bombastic style, Duterte earned global notoriety for a drug crackdown in which at least 6,000 people were killed, and perhaps many more. A statement from Interpol’s Manila office said it received the ICC’s arrest warrant on Tuesday morning. While Duterte has denied extrajudicial killings while in office from 2016 to 2022, he admitted ordering police to shoot resisting suspects. Human Rights Watch’s Bryony Lau called his detention “a critical step for accountability.” Despite Duterte withdrawing the Philippines from the ICC, the court maintains jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.‘s administration indicated its willingness to cooperate with the ICC. Duterte’s former spokesperson labeled the arrest “unlawful detention.”The Beast used specially trained AI to summarize the original source material cited in this article.

A federal Appeals Court has ordered the school to remove the marker. Mike Simons/Getty Images The Texas Senate intends to pass legislation that will require the displaying of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms, the Dallas Morning News reported. Senate Bill 10 (SB 10) would require elementary and secondary schools to display the Ten Commandments on 16-inch by 20-inch posters that are legible from any corner of the classroom. All 20 of the state’s Republican senators signed on to the proposal, which would allow schools to use district funds to buy copies or accept donations of displays that depict the Ten Commandments. According to Sen. Phil King, SB 10’s goal is to provide “moral clarity” to students and promote the nation’s “heritage.” “Louisiana has already passed legislation requiring the display of Ten Commandments in public schools, and at least 14 other states have introduced similar legislation,” King said at a committee hearing on the bill. “It is time for Texas to pass SB 10 to bring back the historical tradition of recognizing our national heritage.” Ultimately, King said he believes the bill could compel the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a wider ruling on the issue.Read it at The Dallas Morning NewsADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTShop with ScoutedHP’s Newest Laser Printer Offers Powerful, Reliable Performance Without the Headaches PAPER CHASEScouted StaffPublished 01.14.25 9:07PM EST HP Scouted selects products independently.

The actor revealed that she had been warned Che had written a “vagina joke” for Jost to read about her live on-air, but when she realized it involved a Costco roast beef sandwich, she thought, “No, Michael!” What made the whole thing “so intense” was that she was backstage at Studio 8H watching the bit live with lights and a camera in her face to capture her reaction. “They were waiting for me to react. I felt insane. I was like, I think I’m going to faint,” she recalled, adding that she and Jost laughed about the whole thing when they finally got in bed at 4 a.m.: “I was like, ‘My nerves are shot.’ And Colin said, ‘Me too.’”Read it at InStyleADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT6X-Rated Video Mistakenly Played at Ex-Colombian President’s TrialSTRIPPED...OF LIBERTYLeigh Kimmins ReporterPublished 03.11.25 12:58PM EDT Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe speaks to the press after attending his first criminal trial hearing, pleading not guilty to procedural fraud and witness bribery charges, in Bogota, Colombia February 10, 2025. REUTERS/Nathalia Angarita REUTERS An AI-enhanced video of a scantily clad woman stripping as well as a bizarre clip of a short man dancing with a bottle of liquor were accidentally played during Colombian ex-president Alvaro Uribe‘s historic bribery trial. Prosecutor Marlene Orjuela instigated the embarrassing double blunder as she tried to pull up audio files on her laptop of conversations between two lawyers also implicated in the ongoing trial. The faux pas was caught on a livestream of the trial. Uribe, who is charged with bribery, witness tampering and procedural fraud, looked unimpressed as the whole court—including the judge—burst into laughter. “Your Honor, my apologies. We didn’t foresee that this would happen,” Orjuela said, chuckling after showing the short man dancing merrily. “My apologies, Your Honor, but, well… it’s just that…” she mumbled as the trial turned farcical after the second clip, that appeared to be from a porn site, played. It showed an AI-doctored female in a swimsuit dancing and revealing her buttocks and vagina. Uribe, who denies all charges, likely did not find the slip-up humorous as he faces 12 years in jail.

Steven Payne, a 37-year-old from Melbourne, was four or five weeks into a six-month vacation with his partner and their dog when he went surfing at the remote Wharton Beach, about an hour from Esperance. The fatal attack occurred on Monday, but authorities have yet to recover Payne’s remains, The Guardian reported. A witness captured drone footage of a shark swimming away from a cloud of blood near the beach and a surfboard with bite marks was found. “Our search is a recovery, not a rescue,” Senior Sgt. Christopher Taylor told reporters. Payne’s family is grappling with the loss, and the Esperance community is also in mourning. “The whole community of Esperance feels the pain,” Taylor said, noting that the area, some 500 miles south of Perth, has now experienced four shark-related fatalities since 2017.

Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, who went viral for grilling Trump administration officials and using a “whiteboard of justice” to simplify their policies, is aiming to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom. She hasn’t included Harris in her campaign calculations, saying the former vice president would have a “field-clearing effect.” Her advisers added that Porter “wouldn’t run against Kamala... and likely none of the others will either.” But if Harris decides not to enter the race, Porter think she has a shot at governor, and she’s focusing her campaign on an anti-Trump agenda. “I won’t ever back down when Trump’s hurting Californians,” she said, adding that she’s running against “Big Oil, Big Banks or Big Pharma screwing people over.” Porter represented Orange County in the U.S. House for three terms.

Katie Porter steps into crowded California governor’s race","text":"By MICHAEL R. BLOOD\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Former Democratic U.S. House member Katie Porter announced Tuesday that she is entering the 2026 contest for California governor, joining a crowded field of candidates that could be upended if former Vice President Kamala Harris joins the race.\n\nPorter, who became a social media celebrity by brandishing a white board at congressional hearings while grilling CEOs, promised in a campaign launch video to be an aggressive counterweight to President Donald Trump’s administration at a time when the heavily Democratic state has clashed with the White House over issues from water management to immigrant rights.\n\n“In Congress, I held the Trump administration’s feet to the fire when they hurt Americans. As governor, I won’t ever back down when Trump hurts Californians — whether he’s holding up disaster relief, attacking our rights or our communities, or screwing over working families to benefit himself and his cronies,” Porter said.\n\nThe contest to replace term-limited Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom already has lured a large scrum of announced and likely candidates that would be upended if Harris decides to seek the state’s top office.\n\nHarris, a former state attorney general and U.S. senator, has not ruled out seeking the governorship since she left Washington in January after a failed presidential bid. Porter is friendly with the former vice president and has indicated she would step aside if Harris joins the race. In 2012, Harris, then California’s attorney general, appointed Porter to be the state’s independent bank monitor in a multibillion-dollar nationwide mortgage settlement.\n\nIf Harris gets in the race “there are very few politicians who would want to take her on,” said Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney. “She’d be likely to win the Democratic nomination and Democrats are likely to win the governorship.”\n\nPorter, who made an unsuccessful run for U.S. Senate last year and also is known for her small-dollar fundraising prowess, becomes one of the best known candidates, joining former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and Lt. Gov. Eleni Kounalakis, among others, on the Democratic side.\n\nDemocrats are expected to easily hold the seat in a state where they outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2-to-1. Republicans have not won a statewide election in California in nearly two decades.\n\nOn the GOP side, Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco last month became the first major Republican to announce a bid to replace Newsom, whose term runs through early January 2027. He blamed Democrats for the ongoing homeless crisis and runaway housing prices.\n\nEven if Harris gets in the race, the state’s open primary system can be unpredictable — all candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, and only the top two vote-getters advance to the November general election. Trump-aligned candidates could enter on the GOP side, generating conservative interest, or a wealthy candidate could emerge with the funds to rattle the expected order.\n\n“These open primaries are hard to handicap,” said Democratic consultant Andrew Acosta. “It just makes it harder to predict.”\n\nPorter, a progressive favorite, created an online backlash after losing the 2024 Senate race, when she faulted “billionaires spending millions to rig this election.” She finished third in the primary — behind Democrat and now-Sen. Adam Schiff and Republican Steve Garvey — and did not advance to the November election.\n\nSome likened her words to Trump’s baseless claims of election fraud in 2020. Porter later clarified her initial statement to say she didn’t believe the California vote count or election process had been compromised but she didn’t recant her earlier remarks. Rigged, she said in a follow-up, “means manipulated by dishonest means.”\n\nShe has been an active fundraiser since leaving her Southern California House district in January and returned to teaching at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law.\n\nA consumer protection attorney before her election to the House, Porter became known in Congress for her unsparing interrogations of business leaders and other committee witnesses, often using her whiteboard to break down complex figures while using plainspoken language to assail corporate greed.\n\nFirst elected to Congress in 2018, Porter said in her video that “I first ran for office to hold Trump accountable. I feel that same call to serve now to stop him from hurting Californians.”","summary":"She joins a crowded field that could be upended if Kamala Harris joins the race.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/03/11/katie-porter-california-governors-race/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/California_Governor_Porter_50720.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 17:21:15","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":299113334,"title":"James Cameron’s Wife ‘Cried For Hours’ After Seeing New ‘Avatar’ Flick","text":"1Fired Starbucks Manager: LGBTQ+ Co-Workers Harassed Me for Being StraightNO ALLIES HEREKenneal Patterson Breaking News InternUpdated 03.11.25 2:00PM EDT / Published 03.11.25 1:40PM EDT A customer sits in a Starbucks coffee shop in New York Keith Bedford/Reuters A fired Starbucks manager is suing the company and claiming he faced discrimination and harassment for being a straight man.

PRESIDENTThe Daily BeastPublished 03.11.25 1:57PM EDT Lisa Marie David/Reuters Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested Tuesday on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant accusing him of “crimes against humanity” for a brutal anti-drug campaign in which thousands were killed. Duterte, 79, was taken into custody at Manila airport on his return from a trip to Hong Kong, CNN reported. He questioned the legality of the ICC warrant, saying in a video posted by his daughter: “What is the law and what is the crime that I committed?” Known as “Asia’s Trump” for his bombastic style, Duterte earned global notoriety for a drug crackdown in which at least 6,000 people were killed, and perhaps many more. A statement from Interpol’s Manila office said it received the ICC’s arrest warrant on Tuesday morning. While Duterte has denied extrajudicial killings while in office from 2016 to 2022, he admitted ordering police to shoot resisting suspects. Human Rights Watch’s Bryony Lau called his detention “a critical step for accountability.” Despite Duterte withdrawing the Philippines from the ICC, the court maintains jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.‘s administration indicated its willingness to cooperate with the ICC. Duterte’s former spokesperson labeled the arrest “unlawful detention.”The Beast used specially trained AI to summarize the original source material cited in this article.

A federal Appeals Court has ordered the school to remove the marker. Mike Simons/Getty Images The Texas Senate intends to pass legislation that will require the displaying of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms, the Dallas Morning News reported. Senate Bill 10 (SB 10) would require elementary and secondary schools to display the Ten Commandments on 16-inch by 20-inch posters that are legible from any corner of the classroom. All 20 of the state’s Republican senators signed on to the proposal, which would allow schools to use district funds to buy copies or accept donations of displays that depict the Ten Commandments. According to Sen. Phil King, SB 10’s goal is to provide “moral clarity” to students and promote the nation’s “heritage.” “Louisiana has already passed legislation requiring the display of Ten Commandments in public schools, and at least 14 other states have introduced similar legislation,” King said at a committee hearing on the bill. “It is time for Texas to pass SB 10 to bring back the historical tradition of recognizing our national heritage.” Ultimately, King said he believes the bill could compel the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a wider ruling on the issue.Read it at The Dallas Morning NewsADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTShop with ScoutedHP’s Newest Laser Printer Offers Powerful, Reliable Performance Without the Headaches PAPER CHASEScouted StaffPublished 01.14.25 9:07PM EST HP Scouted selects products independently.

I was like—it was so gross. It was really gross. And, like, old-school gross,” Johansson told InStyle as part of a new profile pegged to her role in the upcoming Jurassic World: Rebirth. The actor revealed that she had been warned Che had written a “vagina joke” for Jost to read about her live on-air, but when she realized it involved a Costco roast beef sandwich, she thought, “No, Michael!” What made the whole thing “so intense” was that she was backstage at Studio 8H watching the bit live with lights and a camera in her face to capture her reaction. “They were waiting for me to react. I felt insane. I was like, I think I’m going to faint,” she recalled, adding that she and Jost laughed about the whole thing when they finally got in bed at 4 a.m.: “I was like, ‘My nerves are shot.’ And Colin said, ‘Me too.’”Read it at InStyleADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT6X-Rated Video Mistakenly Played at Ex-Colombian President’s TrialSTRIPPED...OF LIBERTYLeigh Kimmins ReporterPublished 03.11.25 12:58PM EDT Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe speaks to the press after attending his first criminal trial hearing, pleading not guilty to procedural fraud and witness bribery charges, in Bogota, Colombia February 10, 2025. REUTERS/Nathalia Angarita REUTERS An AI-enhanced video of a scantily clad woman stripping as well as a bizarre clip of a short man dancing with a bottle of liquor were accidentally played during Colombian ex-president Alvaro Uribe‘s historic bribery trial. Prosecutor Marlene Orjuela instigated the embarrassing double blunder as she tried to pull up audio files on her laptop of conversations between two lawyers also implicated in the ongoing trial. The faux pas was caught on a livestream of the trial. Uribe, who is charged with bribery, witness tampering and procedural fraud, looked unimpressed as the whole court—including the judge—burst into laughter. “Your Honor, my apologies. We didn’t foresee that this would happen,” Orjuela said, chuckling after showing the short man dancing merrily. “My apologies, Your Honor, but, well… it’s just that…” she mumbled as the trial turned farcical after the second clip, that appeared to be from a porn site, played. It showed an AI-doctored female in a swimsuit dancing and revealing her buttocks and vagina. Uribe, who denies all charges, likely did not find the slip-up humorous as he faces 12 years in jail. The 72-year-old was president of Colombia between 2002 and 2010.

The fatal attack occurred on Monday, but authorities have yet to recover Payne’s remains, The Guardian reported. A witness captured drone footage of a shark swimming away from a cloud of blood near the beach and a surfboard with bite marks was found. “Our search is a recovery, not a rescue,” Senior Sgt. Christopher Taylor told reporters. Payne’s family is grappling with the loss, and the Esperance community is also in mourning. “The whole community of Esperance feels the pain,” Taylor said, noting that the area, some 500 miles south of Perth, has now experienced four shark-related fatalities since 2017.

Authorities are warning that as many as 30,000 more residents could be in danger and should self-evacuate. The 12,300-foot-high volcano, one of Central America’s most active, began its latest eruption late Sunday night with no immediate casualties reported, according to the Associated Press. Schools near the volcano have been closed, and a crucial road has been blocked due to ash. Isaac García, 43, who fled with his family, said, “We were a little worried because a few years ago the volcano became active.” The threat of destructive ash and debris looms large, with the flow of volcanic material expected to intensify, according to the national disaster agency.The Beast used specially trained AI to summarize the original source material cited in this article.

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission.If you’re looking for effective anti-aging skincare formulas that don’t cost the sum of a monthly mortgage payment, take a cue from reality TV star Bethenny Frankel. Frankel, who has amassed quite the following on TikTok over the years, uses the platform to showcase her favorite products, including both luxury and drugstore formulas. One of her favorite brands for skincare and cosmetics is No7—specifically, its Future Renew collection. Each formula in the line is affordably priced under $50 but, according to Frankel, looks, feels, and performs like higher-end counterparts. No7 Future Renew Damage Reversal SerumSee At No7$40One of her favorites is the Future Renew Damage Reversal Eye Serum. The lightweight anti-aging serum is formulated with Pepticology, the brand’s new and patent-pending peptide technology. This technology is formulated to reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles while aiding in the skin’s natural repair process for a firmer, brighter, and smoother complexion. Frankel also notes that the wallet-friendly serum layers well with other skincare products (she uses it under her moisturizer), and it “plays well with makeup.”While skincare is always a worthy splurge (after all, our skin is our biggest organ), you don’t have to shell out $100+ for effective formulas that target the visible signs of aging.ADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT9Katie Porter Enters Race That Could Pit Her Against Kamala HarrisIT’S ONKenneal Patterson Breaking News InternPublished 03.11.25 12:20PM EDT Mario Tama/Getty Images A new candidate for California governor has entered the race as Kamala Harris decides whether she’s running—or entering the presidential race again. Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, who went viral for grilling Trump administration officials and using a “whiteboard of justice” to simplify their policies, is aiming to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom. She hasn’t included Harris in her campaign calculations, saying the former vice president would have a “field-clearing effect.” Her advisers added that Porter “wouldn’t run against Kamala... and likely none of the others will either.” But if Harris decides not to enter the race, Porter think she has a shot at governor, and she’s focusing her campaign on an anti-Trump agenda. “I won’t ever back down when Trump’s hurting Californians,” she said, adding that she’s running against “Big Oil, Big Banks or Big Pharma screwing people over.” Porter represented Orange County in the U.S. House for three terms. She was taught the political ropes by Elizabeth Warren—and even named her child after the Massachusetts senator.

The Tesla mogul said in a Fox Business interview Monday that he would dip into a pool of tech bros to reach his goal of adding 100 more DOGE workers to his existing 100-strong team. “Basically, it’s software people, information security software people and finance,” Musk said. “It’s basically, yes, finance and technology.” He added that his army is “pretty much” in every government department already. The Hill reported that some of his confirmed staffers have ties to his companies, Tesla and xAI, his artificial intelligence firm. Musk also repeated his heroic trope about saving America from so-called fraud. “The goal here is: Let’s not have America go bankrupt with waste and fraud,” Musk told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. “So that’s what I’m here for.” It comes after a report emerged that Musk’s demands for government cuts were met with pushback from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a tense Cabinet meeting last week.

Christopher Thevanesan insists he was a “model employee” but faced a “hostile work environment” because he is heterosexual and “gender-typical.” The ex-manager did not reveal the exact details for why he was fired in 2022, but claims his supervisors were hiding “the real reason for doing so.” Now, he’s going after both Starbucks and his LGBTQ+ former coworkers at the Rochester, New York location in a lawsuit that says he sustained “physical, emotional, economic, and psychological damages.” Thevanesan’s attorney added that his heterosexuality was “weaponized” against him. Starbucks did not immediately respond to request for comment. Thevanesan’s case comes only weeks after Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s parallel lawsuit claiming Starbucks has “systemic racial, sexual, and sexual orientation discrimination” because of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. It also echos the recent case of Marlean Ames, who claims she didn’t get a promotion at the Ohio Department of Youth Services because her organization chose a less qualified lesbian candidate. Ames is white, straight, and cisgender. Her case was reopened by the U.S. Supreme Court and a victory could allow more straight employees to allege discrimination.

She hasn’t included Harris in her campaign calculations, saying the former vice president would have a “field-clearing effect.” Her advisers added that Porter “wouldn’t run against Kamala... and likely none of the others will either.” But if Harris decides not to enter the race, Porter think she has a shot at governor, and she’s focusing her campaign on an anti-Trump agenda. “I won’t ever back down when Trump’s hurting Californians,” she said, adding that she’s running against “Big Oil, Big Banks or Big Pharma screwing people over.” Porter represented Orange County in the U.S. House for three terms.

The Tesla mogul said in a Fox Business interview Monday that he would dip into a pool of tech bros to reach his goal of adding 100 more DOGE workers to his existing 100-strong team. “Basically, it’s software people, information security software people and finance,” Musk said. “It’s basically, yes, finance and technology.” He added that his army is “pretty much” in every government department already. The Hill reported that some of his confirmed staffers have ties to his companies, Tesla and xAI, his artificial intelligence firm. Musk also repeated his heroic trope about saving America from so-called fraud. “The goal here is: Let’s not have America go bankrupt with waste and fraud,” Musk told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. “So that’s what I’m here for.” It comes after a report emerged that Musk’s demands for government cuts were met with pushback from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a tense Cabinet meeting last week.

Christopher Thevanesan insists he was a “model employee” but faced a “hostile work environment” because he is heterosexual and “gender-typical.” The ex-manager did not reveal the exact details for why he was fired in 2022, but claims his supervisors were hiding “the real reason for doing so.” Now, he’s going after both Starbucks and his LGBTQ+ former coworkers at the Rochester, New York location in a lawsuit that says he sustained “physical, emotional, economic, and psychological damages.” Thevanesan’s attorney added that his heterosexuality was “weaponized” against him. Starbucks did not immediately respond to request for comment. Thevanesan’s case comes only weeks after Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s parallel lawsuit claiming Starbucks has “systemic racial, sexual, and sexual orientation discrimination” because of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. It also echos the recent case of Marlean Ames, who claims she didn’t get a promotion at the Ohio Department of Youth Services because her organization chose a less qualified lesbian candidate. Ames is white, straight, and cisgender. Her case was reopened by the U.S. Supreme Court and a victory could allow more straight employees to allege discrimination.

PRESIDENTThe Daily BeastPublished 03.11.25 1:57PM EDT Lisa Marie David/Reuters Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested Tuesday on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant accusing him of “crimes against humanity” for a brutal anti-drug campaign in which thousands were killed. Duterte, 79, was taken into custody at Manila airport on his return from a trip to Hong Kong, CNN reported. He questioned the legality of the ICC warrant, saying in a video posted by his daughter: “What is the law and what is the crime that I committed?” Known as “Asia’s Trump” for his bombastic style, Duterte earned global notoriety for a drug crackdown in which at least 6,000 people were killed, and perhaps many more. A statement from Interpol’s Manila office said it received the ICC’s arrest warrant on Tuesday morning. While Duterte has denied extrajudicial killings while in office from 2016 to 2022, he admitted ordering police to shoot resisting suspects. Human Rights Watch’s Bryony Lau called his detention “a critical step for accountability.” Despite Duterte withdrawing the Philippines from the ICC, the court maintains jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.‘s administration indicated its willingness to cooperate with the ICC. Duterte’s former spokesperson labeled the arrest “unlawful detention.”The Beast used specially trained AI to summarize the original source material cited in this article.

I was like—it was so gross. It was really gross. And, like, old-school gross,” Johansson told InStyle as part of a new profile pegged to her role in the upcoming Jurassic World: Rebirth. The actor revealed that she had been warned Che had written a “vagina joke” for Jost to read about her live on-air, but when she realized it involved a Costco roast beef sandwich, she thought, “No, Michael!” What made the whole thing “so intense” was that she was backstage at Studio 8H watching the bit live with lights and a camera in her face to capture her reaction. “They were waiting for me to react. I felt insane. I was like, I think I’m going to faint,” she recalled, adding that she and Jost laughed about the whole thing when they finally got in bed at 4 a.m.: “I was like, ‘My nerves are shot.’ And Colin said, ‘Me too.’”Read it at InStyleADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT6X-Rated Video Mistakenly Played at Ex-Colombian President’s TrialSTRIPPED...OF LIBERTYLeigh Kimmins ReporterPublished 03.11.25 12:58PM EDT Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe speaks to the press after attending his first criminal trial hearing, pleading not guilty to procedural fraud and witness bribery charges, in Bogota, Colombia February 10, 2025.

TMTG launched Truth Social, a rival social media platform, which continues to be Trump's main outlet though he was restored to Twitter, now X, after Elon Musk purchased that platform.The sharp fall in Trump's wealth will raise questions about how his political and business interests are intertwined, and his handling of the American economy more generally, with the president refusing to rule out a recession on Sunday.What To KnowAccording to Forbes as of 11:20 a.m. ET on Tuesday Trump had a net wealth of $4.6 billion, making him the 753rd richest person in the world.However this represents a substantial fall from mid-January when Forbes recorded the then president-elect's wealth at $7 billion, following a $875 million surge in the value of TMTG shares, of which Trump owns the majority.Over the same period TMTG stock has fallen sharply in value from $42.91 per share on January 13 to $19.29 as of 11:20 a.m. ET on Tuesday.Since the company went public in March 2024, TMTG stock has been highly volatile, closing at a high of $66.22 on its second day of trading before plummeting to a close of $22.84 on April 16.Seemingly linked to the political fortunes of Trump, TMTG stock bounced back at the start of May and then dropped after the then presumptive Republican presidential nominee was found guilty of falsifying business records in relation to a hush money payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels.TMTG stock went on a steady decline through the summer amid upheaval in the race for president, with Vice President Kamala Harris replacing President Joe Biden on the top of the Democratic ticket, and hit a record low closing price of $12.15 in mid-September.In December 2024 Trump transferred around 114.75 million worth of TMTG shares to the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, which he owns and has his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr., as the sole trustee.Trump's sharp decline in wealth comes after the S&P 500 lost 2.7 percent of its value on Monday amidst fears the president's ongoing trade wars could plunge the country into a recession. Speaking to Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday Trump refused to rule out a recession, commenting: \"I hate to predict things like that.\"Earlier this month Trump introduced tariffs of 25 percent on all imports from Mexico and Canadian produce with the exception of oil, along with an additional 10 percent tariff on China. This sparked retaliatory tariffs targeting American business from Ottawa, Canada's provinces and Beijing.On Tuesday Trump declared a \"national emergency on electricity\" after Ontario Premier Doug Ford introduced a 25 percent surcharge on electricity exports to three American states. He also raised tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum from 25 percent to 50 percent.What People Are SayingWhen asked about the possibility of a recession by Fox News on Sunday Trump replied: \"I hate to predict things like that. There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big.\"There are always periods of...it takes a little time. It takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us.\"In a press release on Monday Ontario Premier Doug Ford said: \"President Trump's tariffs are a disaster for the U.S. economy. They're making life more expensive for American families and businesses. Until the threat of tariffs is gone for good, Ontario won't back down. We'll stand strong, use every tool in our toolkit and do whatever it takes to protect Ontario.\"What Happens NextTrump's wealth and the TMTG share price have fluctuated considerably over the past year, often seeming more responsive to his political fortunes than any particular business decisions. If this model holds Trump's future wealth is likely to be heavily influenced by his actions as president and the broader impact they have on the U.S. economy.","summary":"On Sunday Trump told Fox News he couldn't rule out the U.S. economy going into recession.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-net-worth-billions-wiped-off-fortune-tmtg-shares-tumble-2042963","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2604842/donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-11 16:58:07","author":"James Bickerton","authors":["James Bickerton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.045},{"id":299113338,"title":"Surfer on Dream Vacation Fatally Mauled by Shark","text":"1Fired Starbucks Manager: LGBTQ+ Co-Workers Harassed Me for Being StraightNO ALLIES HEREKenneal Patterson Breaking News InternUpdated 03.11.25 2:00PM EDT / Published 03.11.25 1:40PM EDT A customer sits in a Starbucks coffee shop in New York Keith Bedford/Reuters A fired Starbucks manager is suing the company and claiming he faced discrimination and harassment for being a straight man. Christopher Thevanesan insists he was a “model employee” but faced a “hostile work environment” because he is heterosexual and “gender-typical.” The ex-manager did not reveal the exact details for why he was fired in 2022, but claims his supervisors were hiding “the real reason for doing so.” Now, he’s going after both Starbucks and his LGBTQ+ former coworkers at the Rochester, New York location in a lawsuit that says he sustained “physical, emotional, economic, and psychological damages.” Thevanesan’s attorney added that his heterosexuality was “weaponized” against him. Starbucks did not immediately respond to request for comment. Thevanesan’s case comes only weeks after Missouri Republican Attorney General Andrew Bailey’s parallel lawsuit claiming Starbucks has “systemic racial, sexual, and sexual orientation discrimination” because of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies. It also echos the recent case of Marlean Ames, who claims she didn’t get a promotion at the Ohio Department of Youth Services because her organization chose a less qualified lesbian candidate. Ames is white, straight, and cisgender. Her case was reopened by the U.S. Supreme Court and a victory could allow more straight employees to allege discrimination.

And his wife would probably agree, if her reported reaction is anything to go by. “She bawled for four hours,” he told Empire. “She kept trying to get her s*** back together so she could tell me specific reactions, and then she’d just tear up and start crying again. Finally, I’m like, ‘Honey, I’ve got to go to bed.

PRESIDENTThe Daily BeastPublished 03.11.25 1:57PM EDT Lisa Marie David/Reuters Former Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte was arrested Tuesday on an International Criminal Court (ICC) warrant accusing him of “crimes against humanity” for a brutal anti-drug campaign in which thousands were killed. Duterte, 79, was taken into custody at Manila airport on his return from a trip to Hong Kong, CNN reported. He questioned the legality of the ICC warrant, saying in a video posted by his daughter: “What is the law and what is the crime that I committed?” Known as “Asia’s Trump” for his bombastic style, Duterte earned global notoriety for a drug crackdown in which at least 6,000 people were killed, and perhaps many more. A statement from Interpol’s Manila office said it received the ICC’s arrest warrant on Tuesday morning. While Duterte has denied extrajudicial killings while in office from 2016 to 2022, he admitted ordering police to shoot resisting suspects. Human Rights Watch’s Bryony Lau called his detention “a critical step for accountability.” Despite Duterte withdrawing the Philippines from the ICC, the court maintains jurisdiction over crimes committed during the membership period. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr.‘s administration indicated its willingness to cooperate with the ICC. Duterte’s former spokesperson labeled the arrest “unlawful detention.”The Beast used specially trained AI to summarize the original source material cited in this article.

A federal Appeals Court has ordered the school to remove the marker. Mike Simons/Getty Images The Texas Senate intends to pass legislation that will require the displaying of the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms, the Dallas Morning News reported. Senate Bill 10 (SB 10) would require elementary and secondary schools to display the Ten Commandments on 16-inch by 20-inch posters that are legible from any corner of the classroom. All 20 of the state’s Republican senators signed on to the proposal, which would allow schools to use district funds to buy copies or accept donations of displays that depict the Ten Commandments. According to Sen. Phil King, SB 10’s goal is to provide “moral clarity” to students and promote the nation’s “heritage.” “Louisiana has already passed legislation requiring the display of Ten Commandments in public schools, and at least 14 other states have introduced similar legislation,” King said at a committee hearing on the bill. “It is time for Texas to pass SB 10 to bring back the historical tradition of recognizing our national heritage.” Ultimately, King said he believes the bill could compel the U.S. Supreme Court to issue a wider ruling on the issue.Read it at The Dallas Morning NewsADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENTShop with ScoutedHP’s Newest Laser Printer Offers Powerful, Reliable Performance Without the Headaches PAPER CHASEScouted StaffPublished 01.14.25 9:07PM EST HP Scouted selects products independently.

I was like—it was so gross. It was really gross. And, like, old-school gross,” Johansson told InStyle as part of a new profile pegged to her role in the upcoming Jurassic World: Rebirth. The actor revealed that she had been warned Che had written a “vagina joke” for Jost to read about her live on-air, but when she realized it involved a Costco roast beef sandwich, she thought, “No, Michael!” What made the whole thing “so intense” was that she was backstage at Studio 8H watching the bit live with lights and a camera in her face to capture her reaction. “They were waiting for me to react. I felt insane. I was like, I think I’m going to faint,” she recalled, adding that she and Jost laughed about the whole thing when they finally got in bed at 4 a.m.: “I was like, ‘My nerves are shot.’ And Colin said, ‘Me too.’”Read it at InStyleADVERTISEMENTADVERTISEMENT6X-Rated Video Mistakenly Played at Ex-Colombian President’s TrialSTRIPPED...OF LIBERTYLeigh Kimmins ReporterPublished 03.11.25 12:58PM EDT Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe speaks to the press after attending his first criminal trial hearing, pleading not guilty to procedural fraud and witness bribery charges, in Bogota, Colombia February 10, 2025. REUTERS/Nathalia Angarita REUTERS An AI-enhanced video of a scantily clad woman stripping as well as a bizarre clip of a short man dancing with a bottle of liquor were accidentally played during Colombian ex-president Alvaro Uribe‘s historic bribery trial. Prosecutor Marlene Orjuela instigated the embarrassing double blunder as she tried to pull up audio files on her laptop of conversations between two lawyers also implicated in the ongoing trial. The faux pas was caught on a livestream of the trial. Uribe, who is charged with bribery, witness tampering and procedural fraud, looked unimpressed as the whole court—including the judge—burst into laughter. “Your Honor, my apologies. We didn’t foresee that this would happen,” Orjuela said, chuckling after showing the short man dancing merrily. “My apologies, Your Honor, but, well… it’s just that…” she mumbled as the trial turned farcical after the second clip, that appeared to be from a porn site, played. It showed an AI-doctored female in a swimsuit dancing and revealing her buttocks and vagina. Uribe, who denies all charges, likely did not find the slip-up humorous as he faces 12 years in jail. The 72-year-old was president of Colombia between 2002 and 2010.

Authorities are warning that as many as 30,000 more residents could be in danger and should self-evacuate. The 12,300-foot-high volcano, one of Central America’s most active, began its latest eruption late Sunday night with no immediate casualties reported, according to the Associated Press. Schools near the volcano have been closed, and a crucial road has been blocked due to ash. Isaac García, 43, who fled with his family, said, “We were a little worried because a few years ago the volcano became active.” The threat of destructive ash and debris looms large, with the flow of volcanic material expected to intensify, according to the national disaster agency.The Beast used specially trained AI to summarize the original source material cited in this article.

Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, who went viral for grilling Trump administration officials and using a “whiteboard of justice” to simplify their policies, is aiming to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom. She hasn’t included Harris in her campaign calculations, saying the former vice president would have a “field-clearing effect.” Her advisers added that Porter “wouldn’t run against Kamala... and likely none of the others will either.” But if Harris decides not to enter the race, Porter think she has a shot at governor, and she’s focusing her campaign on an anti-Trump agenda. “I won’t ever back down when Trump’s hurting Californians,” she said, adding that she’s running against “Big Oil, Big Banks or Big Pharma screwing people over.” Porter represented Orange County in the U.S. House for three terms.

The Tesla mogul said in a Fox Business interview Monday that he would dip into a pool of tech bros to reach his goal of adding 100 more DOGE workers to his existing 100-strong team. “Basically, it’s software people, information security software people and finance,” Musk said. “It’s basically, yes, finance and technology.” He added that his army is “pretty much” in every government department already. The Hill reported that some of his confirmed staffers have ties to his companies, Tesla and xAI, his artificial intelligence firm. Musk also repeated his heroic trope about saving America from so-called fraud. “The goal here is: Let’s not have America go bankrupt with waste and fraud,” Musk told Fox Business host Larry Kudlow. “So that’s what I’m here for.” It comes after a report emerged that Musk’s demands for government cuts were met with pushback from Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy in a tense Cabinet meeting last week.

But if Trump's intention is to help reverse the frightening plunge in Tesla stock, he could have the opposite effect by turning off even more buyers. Tesla is becoming a political symbol of Trump and DOGE, and that is a bad thing for the brand, said Wedbush Securities financial analyst Dan Ives. You think it's helping, but it's actually hurting. In an overnight post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Musk is putting it on the line to help the country. Trump claimed in the post that Radical Left Lunatics were attempting to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby. Trump's message came after one of the worst single day sell-offs in Tesla's history. The stock was up in midday trading Tuesday, rising 3%. In a message on X, Musk expressed confidence, writing that the stock will be fine long-term. Tesla has been pummeled this year under competition from rival electric vehicles, particularly out of China, as well as his close association with Trump and with far right causes globally. Shares have plummeted 45% in 2025 and on Monday tumbled more than 15% to $222.15, the lowest since late October, reflecting newfound pessimism as sales crater around the globe. Numerous auto industry analysts have attributed Tesla's recent sagging stock - and auto sales - to Musk's support of Trump and other far right candidates around the world. In recent days, Tesla showrooms in the U.S. have been besieged by protesters, its vehicles vandalized on the street. Tesla owners, perhaps in a bid to avoid being targeted, have placed bumper stickers on their cars with messages like, I bought it before Elon went nuts. Federal prosecutors charged a woman in connection with a string of vandalism against a Colorado Tesla dealership, which included Molotov cocktails being thrown at vehicles and the words Nazi cars spray painted on the building. Musk pumped $270 million into Trump's campaign heading into the 2024 election, appeared on stage with him and cheered Trump's victory over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris in November. Tesla stock soared to $479 per share by mid-December, but have since lost 45% of their value. Musk has become the face of the Trump administration's slash-and-burn government downsizing efforts, known as the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The department has promised massive federal worker layoffs and aims to drastically reduce government spending. Analysts have said Musk's shift to right-wing politics doesn't appear to sit well with potential Tesla buyers, generally perceived to be wealthy and progressive consumers. Tesla sales are falling precipitously in California, the company's biggest U.S. market, and the company recorded its first annual global sales decline last year. Similarly, Tesla sales plunged 45% in Europe in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as overall electric vehicle sales rose. The sales numbers were particularly bad in Germany and France. The latest auto sales figure from China show that Tesla sales there have been nearly halved from February a year ago, although the decline is largely due increased competition from domestic EV companies. But sales in the U.S. have fallen due to competition, and a country sharply divided about Trump. U.S. Analysts at UBS Global Research expect deliveries to fall 5% in the first quarter and full year compared to the same periods for 2024. Our UBS Evidence Lab data shows low delivery times for the Model 3 and Model Y (generally within two weeks) in key markets which we believe is indicative of softer demand, they wrote. In addition to backing Trump, Musk has also shown support for the far-right, pro-Russian, anti-Muslim party in German y, called the British p rime minister an evil tyrant and called Canada - a major Tesla market - not a real country. Tesla is not the only Musk-led company to run into trouble recently. His X social media platform crashed several times on Monday, which Musk claimed was a massive cyberattack.

Former Democratic Rep. Katie Porter, who went viral for grilling Trump administration officials and using a “whiteboard of justice” to simplify their policies, is aiming to succeed Gov. Gavin Newsom. She hasn’t included Harris in her campaign calculations, saying the former vice president would have a “field-clearing effect.” Her advisers added that Porter “wouldn’t run against Kamala... and likely none of the others will either.” But if Harris decides not to enter the race, Porter think she has a shot at governor, and she’s focusing her campaign on an anti-Trump agenda. “I won’t ever back down when Trump’s hurting Californians,” she said, adding that she’s running against “Big Oil, Big Banks or Big Pharma screwing people over.” Porter represented Orange County in the U.S. House for three terms.

Harris attended the Human[X] AI conference Sunday in Las Vegas, which was billed as Harris' \"first post-election address.\" She took the stage with Nuno Sebastiao, the CEO of data science company Feedzai. Harris recounted that on the night of the Academy Awards, March 2, she had a hankering for nacho cheese Doritos chips and had them delivered to her house via DoorDash, according to clips of the interview on social media. KAMALA HARRIS MOCKED ONLINE FOR ANOTHER 'WORD SALAD' ABOUT 'COMMUNITY' DURING FIRE DEPARTMENT VISIT \"We did DoorDash ’cause I wanted Doritos, and the red carpet part was about to start, and nobody wanted to leave to go to the grocery store,\" Harris said. \"So it was DoorDash. … So I was willing to give up whatever might be the tracking of Kamala Harris’ particular fondness for nacho cheese Doritos for the sake of getting a big bag of Doritos as I watched the Oscars.\" Sebastio weighed in that Harris was providing an example of \"consumer behavior\" to the audience, which is how businesses study the purchasing practices of consumers and how those practices are influenced by outside factors, such as cultural or social influence. KAMALA HARRIS MOCKED OVER 'WORD SALAD' SPEECH TO CAST OF ‘A WONDERFUL WORLD: THE LOUIS ARMSTRONG MUSICAL’ \"But here’s the thing. At what point do we also uplift and highlight the consumer’s right to also expect — and you can debate with me if it should be a right — I think it should,\" she continued in the clip of the video. \"To expect that the innovation would also be weighted in terms of solving their everyday problems, which are beyond my craving for Doritos, but about whatever — and I know the work is happening around — you know, scientific discoveries, for example. To cure long-standing diseases.\" \"But I’m going to throw out another one … I would love it if there would be an investment of resources in solving the affordable housing issue in America,\" she said. \"Like help me with that. Help me with that.\" Fox News Digital reached out to Harris' office for comment on the conference and social media reactions but did not immediately receive a reply. Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, shared a photo of Harris on the evening of the Academy Awards pouring a bag of Doritos into a bowl — ostensibly the bag she DoorDashed that evening. Conservatives and critics lambasted Harris' recent \"word salad\" at the AI conference, mocking that her election loss to President Donald Trump \"remains a mystery.\" HARRIS RIPPED FOR 'WORD SALAD' AFTER HECKLER INTERRUPTION DURING CAMPAIGN SPEECH: 'THE GIBBERISH NEVER ENDS' Harris' fondness for Doritos has frequently been in public view, including recounting that she ate \"a family-sized bag of nacho Doritos\" on election night 2016, as well as celebrating her love of the chips during a campaign stop at a Pennsylvania Sheetz convenience store in August. KAMALA HARRIS LAUGHS AT HER OWN 'THE CONTEXT IN WHICH YOU EXIST' WORD SALAD: 'YEAH, I DID THAT' \"This is my go-to, the original, nacho cheese,\" Harris said during the stop.

The newspaper's opinions editor, David Shipley, had already resigned because of the shift.The storied newspaper has been in a free fall, financially and editorially, over the past year. Marcus, who worked in the news and opinion departments during her career, is \"the bedrock of The Washington Post, embodying the history of the place as well as the talent and accomplishments of its journalists,\" said Paul Farhi, a former media reporter there.Marcus said that the Post's publisher, Will Lewis, declined to run her column, which she described as \"respectfully dissenting\" from Bezos' edict. It was the first time in nearly 20 years of writing columns that she's had one killed, she said.The decision \"underscores that the traditional freedom of columnists to select the topics they wish to address and say what they think has been dangerously eroded,\" she wrote. Her resignation letter was first reported by The New York Times.A Post spokesperson said Monday that \"we're grateful for Ruth's significant contributions to The Washington Post over the past 40 years. We respect her decision to leave and wish her the best.\"While Bezos and Lewis have the right to make such decisions — they're the bosses — \"that has not been the tradition,\" Farhi said. He likened it to how the Justice Department, while technically under White House control, has generally operated independently. Editorial writers and columnists, paid to give their opinions, usually decide what to write, he said.The danger is that a decision by the publisher not to allow a column to go forward can make readers question whether the viewpoints of writers are truly their own, he said. Worse yet, it could taint the news department, which by most accounts is aggressively covering the new administration.Shortly after the editorial page decision was announced nearly two weeks ago, another Post story on the issue, by media columnist Erik Wemple, was scrapped, according to the Gene Pool, a blog written by former Post writer Gene Weingarten. Wemple declined comment on Monday.In January, editorial cartoonist Ann Telnaes resigned after her work depicting Bezos and other billionaires genuflecting before a statue of President Donald Trump was rejected, a decision Shipley explained at the time was because it was repetitive of other opinion pieces.Under executive editor Matt Murray, the Post has also said it would refrain from having its journalists write about issues involving the newspaper, a decision Wemple said in a chat with readers in January that \"I couldn't possibly dissent (from) more strongly.\"The Post's opinion section on Monday included an editorial opposing Mexico's $10 billion lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, a case before the U.S. Supreme Court. Columnists Max Boot wrote about Trump and Russia, Perry Bacon Jr. about Democratic resistance to Trump centering in the states, Phillip Bump on whether Trump would pay a political price for unpopular policies and Jim Geraghty about violence in Syria.The Post, which made money during the first Trump administration, has been losing money in recent years and its internal strife largely began last June, when Sally Buzbee resigned as executive editor rather than accept a newsroom reorganization. Several prominent Post journalists — among them Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey, Philip Rucker, Matea Gold, Jackie Alemany, Michael Scherer and Will Sommer — have left for other jobs.Bezos' decision last fall that the Post would not endorse a presidential candidate — after the editorial staff had prepared to support Democrat Kamala Harris — led to an exodus of subscribers that the newspaper is fighting to recover from.Marty Baron, the Post's executive editor when Bezos bought the paper in 2013, wrote last week in the Atlantic that Bezos \"handled his ownership admirably for more than a decade. But his courage failed him when he needed it the most.\"Marcus' resignation on Monday overshadowed a newsroom reorganization plan introduced by Murray, including separating workflows for the Post's digital and print products.____David Bauder writes about media for the AP.

Musk has championed DOGE but Trump administration officials say he is not in charge of it. Musk, reeling, was caught off guard by an unexpected question from Kudlow.In the midst of discussing the cuts, Kudlow asked: Are you giving up your other stuff? I mean, how are you running your other businesses? . Musk looked down before responding: With great difficulty , a response that led many online viewers to suggest he appeared uneasy.He let out a quiet, somber chuckle, appearing as if he was about to speak, but instead, a heavy sigh escaped him.

The department has vowed to slash federal jobs and significantly reduce government spending. However, analysts suggest that Musk’s political shift may be alienating Tesla’s core customer base—typically affluent, environmentally conscious consumers who prioritize sustainability. Tesla's sales have slumped in California, its largest US market, and the company reported its first annual global sales decline last year. In Europe, Tesla’s sales plunged 45% in January, according to research firm Jato Dynamics, even as the broader electric vehicle market continued to grow.ALSO READ: 'You are a traitor': Elon Musk vs Mark Kelly in heated exchange after US Senator's Ukraine visitThe company’s struggles have been particularly pronounced in Germany and France.

In any event, I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American. Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???\n\nLet’s go through this in greater detail. \n\n“But the Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla ...” \n\nWhat’s an “illegal boycott,” and what does “collusively” mean? Is it anything like conservatives boycotting Miller Lite because they sponsored an Instagram story featuring a trans influencer? Or when they boycott pretty much anything with a DEI program? \n\n“... one of the World’s great automakers, and Elon’s ‘baby,’ in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for.” \n\nIf Tesla is Elon’s baby, he’s about to abandon it at any moment now. \n\nBut yes, we do wish (economic) harm to Elon because of everything he stands for. With Tesla down 15% Monday, and 50% since its December 17, 2024 peak, the company has lost $800 billion in market value, and Musk has lost well over $120 billion in net worth. \n\nBut we can do better than that! \n\n“They tried to do it to me at the 2024 Presidential Ballot Box, but how did that work out?”\n\nWe got stuck with co-president Elon Musk. Yeah, it sucked. \n\n“In any event, I’m going to buy a brand new Tesla tomorrow morning …”\n\nNo, he won’t. Does Trump even know how to drive? \n\nAnd Fox News host Sean Hannity is also apparently getting in on the Elon pity party and buying himself a Tesla. \n\nTrump has a long history of attacking electric vehicles, including eliminating federal infrastructure spending for charging stations, moving to end buying incentives, and revoking Biden’s goal for 50% electric vehicles by 2030. He’s also ripping 8,000 EV chargers out of government buildings. \n\nBack in 2023, he said “The auto industry is being assassinated” by electric cars, and the transition to electric was a “hit job” on Detroit. Trump also claimed “You can be loyal to American labor or you can be loyal to the environmental lunatics. But you can’t really be loyal to both. It’s one or the other.\"\n\nOn July 12, 2022, Trump even posted this anti-Musk, anti-Tesla screed on Truth Social: \n\nWhen Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it’s electric cars that don’t drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he’d be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, “drop to your knees and beg,” and he would have done it.\n\nMusk built his fortune by selling well-off progressives on a vision of environmental sustainability, yet decided with that genius brain of his to hitch his wagon to the guy screaming “drill, baby, drill” while taking direct aim at the very source of Musk’s wealth. Being a bigoted pro-Putin Nazi is a hell of a drug, apparently, overriding all sense of reason and self-interest.\n\nAlso, it’s illegal for a government official to endorse a product, but yeah, that ship sailed with Trump a long time ago. \n\n“... as a show of confidence and support for Elon Musk, a truly great American.”\n\nCan South Africa and Canada take him back, please? \n\n“Why should he be punished for putting his tremendous skills to work in order to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN???”\n\nNazis should be punished, full stop. That aside, Trump’s base isn’t the kind of people who buy expensive electric vehicles. As I’ve noted several times, 2024 saw a complete reversal from traditional voting patterns—Trump and his party won voters making under $50,000, while Kamala Harris and her Democrats won those making more than $50,000. Democrats are no longer the party of the poor and working class, while Republicans are no longer the party of the rich. \n\nSo which part of Trump’s base is going to buy Musk’s Swastikars? Those working-class MAGA supporters who can’t even afford eggs anymore? The ones who love to roll coal and hate all weenie environmentalists? Or how about rural conservatives without charging infrastructure because Trump killed that program? \n\nHilariously, this endorsement means Tesla will sell even less cars. Way to further alienate Tesla’s core market. Musk, like an idiot, doesn’t see that and thanked Trump for the endorsement. \n\nFlipping through his Truth Social, this one caught my eye as well: \n\nDespite the fact that Canada is charging the USA from 250% to 390% Tariffs on many of our farm products, Ontario just announced a 25% surcharge on “electricity,” of all things, and your not even allowed to do that. Because our Tariffs are reciprocal, we’ll just get it all back on April 2. Canada is a Tariff abuser, and always has been, but the United States is not going to be subsidizing Canada any longer. We don’t need your Cars, we don’t need your Lumber, we don’t your Energy, and very soon, you will find that out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\n\n“Your not even allowed to do that” is peak Trump—illiterate and ridiculous, and hilariously wrong. \n\nSomeone is fucking around, and certainly will soon find out. But it won’t be Canada.","summary":"On Monday, Donald Trump did that thing he does instead of presidenting—penning almost 140 tweets on his Truth Social.
