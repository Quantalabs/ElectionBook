Her speech comes the day after Trump reached 100 days in office. It is expected to be her most extensive public remarks since leaving office in January following her defeat to Trump, with planned critiques of the Republican president's handling of the economy, US institutions and foreign policy. Harris has barely mentioned Trump by name since she conceded defeat to him in November, but she recently addressed the anxiety and confusion that have gripped many of her supporters since Trump took office.

The current moment highlights “the power of kindness, the power of sisterhood, the power of self care.” Harris is ramping up her public presence as Democrats nationally search for a path forward after November's election, in which Republicans also won control of Congress. While a slate of high-profile Democrats — from governors to businessmen — seek leadership roles within the party, the former vice president retains unique influence and would reshape any future race she chooses to enter. Harris, a former state attorney general and US senator from California, has not discouraged speculation that she might enter the race to replace term-limited Governor Gavin Newsom, himself a potential contender for president. And she has not ruled out another run for the White House. She continues to fundraise, using a joint committee that includes Harris for President, the Democratic National Committee and state Democratic parties. The committee, the Harris Victory Fund, reported having about USD 4.5 million on hand at the end of March, according to federal records. In recent fundraising emails, Harris has been blunt about the need for Democrats to unify ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. Democrats need to “organise and stop Trump's agenda while electing Democrats everywhere,” she wrote in recent emails. “There has never been a more important time for a strong Democratic Party — one that is willing to stand up to Donald Trump, Elon Musk and what they are doing to this country.” The event will mark a homecoming of sorts. Harris, who lives in Los Angeles, is from the San Francisco Bay Area.

Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see more of his videos.\n\nHello, this is Victor Davis Hanson for The Daily Signal. At the end of the 100 days of the Trump administration, let’s just review for a moment the opposition to it. And it’s actually, if you think about it, a tripartite, a threefold opposition: pollsters, the media, and the Democratic Party and the institutionalized Left.\n\nThe pollsters have President Donald Trump down four or five points. But when you actually look at the Rasmussen poll or Mark Penn’s poll, a Democratic centrist, Trump is almost even. And then when you look with greater clarity at The New York Times poll that has him way down, you see that only 37% of the people polled voted for Donald Trump. But Donald Trump won by almost a point and a half. Don’t you think it should have been, I don’t know, 51%-49%? So, they were deliberately, in the case of The New York Times, under-polling Trump supporters.\n\nThe same was true with The Washington Post. They polled over 2,000 people, but only 840 were identified as Trump voters. Shouldn’t that have been half? \n\nSo, what am I getting at? We’re getting right back to what happened in 2016 when the polls were completely wrong. The same thing happened in 2020 when they overestimated former President Joe Biden’s strength by four or five points. And then, even in 2024, the NPR poll had—on the last day of the election—they had then-Vice President Kamala Harris winning by four points.\n\nThe Des Moines Register had Iowa lost to Trump by three points. He won it by 12. \n\nSo, what the pollsters are doing—not that Trump hasn’t lost some to the controversy over the trade wars—but the pollsters are trying to create momentum, fundraising, and jazz up opposition.\n\nThen we turn to the media. The media’s in a fight with the Democratic Left now because of the scandal of Joe Biden. The Democratic Left is saying, “Well, you were a journalist. If you thought he was demented or cognitively challenged, why didn’t you report it?” But the journalists are saying, “We couldn’t get close to him. He looked OK for us because you had him in such a guarded environment.” In truth, they’re both guilty.\n\nDo you remember those press conferences by then-White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre? Did anyone ever hear one question on those daily or three or four times a week press conferences? “Miss Jean-Pierre, is Joe Biden cognitively able to navigate himself to the podium? What is the nature of his cue cards? Have you had a Montreal Cognitive Assessment of him?” There was nothing. It was a combination of the Democratic Party, the Biden insiders, and the media.\n\nAnd here’s another point, very quickly. The media has gained a lot of influence and power in the opposition because there is no opposition on the Democratic Party. So, in lieu of an alternate agenda, the media has taken it upon themselves to use the only strategy that the Democratic Party can come up with. And that is to attack Donald Trump. \n\nNow, what do I mean by that? If you look at the Democratic Party and the Left in general, they have boxed themselves in. On the one hand, they have no institutional power; no ability to pass legislation, losing the House and the Senate; no presidency, White House; no executive orders. Ultimately, all of the cherry-picked district and circuit judges will be overturned by a largely conservative Supreme Court.\n\nIn lieu of actual power, then you look at what is the alternative. Maybe the alternative is a 1994 Newt Gingrich Contract with America, an alternate agenda: Yes, we can do better on the border than you can. Yes, we have a better foreign policy with Iran. There’s nothing. There’s no shadow government. There’s not a young Bill Clinton ascendant. There’s no young Barack Obama. There’s nobody. There’s no leaders. There’s no agenda. Nothing. It’s nihilism.\n\nAnd so, let’s look at the third element. Do they have a good old days? Can they say, “Donald Trump ruined things”? “They were so good under Biden. The border was—we liked it open. Twelve million, we could have got 20 million illegal aliens. Let’s go back to that. We had a wonderful retreat from Afghanistan. Picture perfect. We can do it again. The Iran—the theater war in Ukraine and Iran, that wasn’t our fault. Maybe it was inevitable. We had a really good inflation—we had a little hyperinflation of 9%.” \n\nSo, there is no alternative good old days. They can’t say Donald Trump wrecked something because they had wrecked the country.\n\nSo, what are we left with? We’re left with Donald Trump wore a blue suit at the Vatican funeral. Donald Trump is a fascist. No. According to Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, he is a Nazi. No. According to former Vice President Al Gore, he is a Nazi. No. According to members of the Congress, is he deserving a polite conversation? You have to use the F-word. Or maybe it’s the S-word. It’s smutty mouth, potty mouth video. \n\nWhat is the one principle that ties them all together? We’re gonna talk about that in the next video. But it’s about fear that Donald Trump’s first 100 days are not as chaotic and bad as they tell us. But we might be on the cusp of something that will be very, very successful and will ensure Donald Trump has a successful presidency.\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives. Nothing written here is to be construed as representing the views of The Daily Signal.","summary":"Editor’s note: This is a lightly edited transcript of today’s video from Daily Signal Senior Contributor Victor Davis Hanson. Subscribe to our YouTube channel to see...

Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, said Tuesday that he was picked to be on the Democratic ticket because he gave permission to white guys to vote for the party. \n\nWalz appeared alongside ABC News' Brittany Shepherd at Harvard's Kennedy School Institute of Politics for a postmortem of the 2024 race in front of an audience of students. \n\nShepherd pointed out that Walz had been going all over TV - memorably knocking GOP nominee Donald Trump and his running mate Sen. J.D. Vance for being 'weird' - but the media blitz stopped after he was added to the Democratic ticket.\n\nShe asked the Minnesota governor if that had been by design.\n\n'No, I would - yes, the choice to be on this ticket, the privilege of being on it, when you sign up for this, I'm a team player and there's folks that I recognize are smarter than me. Thay analyze this,' Walz said. \n\nHe noted that they were running against a 'very unusual opponent' and only had a short time to do so, with Harris taking over the Democratic nomination on July 21.\n\n'I was on the ticket, I would argue, because we did a lot of amazing, progressive things in Minnesota to improve people's lives,' Walz said. 'But I also was on the ticket, quite honestly, you know, because I could code talk to white guys watching football, fixing their truck, doing that, that I could put them at ease.' \n\n'I was the permission structure to say, \"look you can do this and vote for this,\"' the former VP contender continued. \n\n'And if you look across those swing states, with the exception of Minnesota, we didn't get enough of those folks,' he said.\n\nShepherd pointed out that Walz could have been 'giving them permission on TV every day.'\n\nThe Minnesota governor was mostly deployed to in-person rallies during his time as Harris' running mate.\n\nEarly on, he also got tripped up by reports that questioned some of the anecdotes he shared, like being in China during Tiananmen Square. \n\nThose flubs also dragged down his debate appearance against Vance.\n\nWalz admitted that he had was a bit gaffe-prone when he answered Shepherd.\n\n'Yes, but I also said, I understand myself. I said, I think I'll give you pretty good stuff, but I'll also give you 10 percent problematic,' the governor said. \n\nHe didn't drag campaign officials too badly, noting that 'somebody's got to make the decision here.' \n\n'Look, we had the most qualified person who'd run for president in this country's history, at the top of the ticket that, in itself, should have got this thing won,' Walz argued. \n\nHarris had served as vice president, a U.S. senator, California's attorney general and the district attorney of San Francisco and had a failed presidential bid on her resume before taking the place of Biden. \n\n'We had, in my opinion, and you can disagree with me - I think history will prove me right - a very unqualified person on the other side,' he claimed.\n\n'And you have to determine, how do you get those hits? What's the best way? Did it make sense to continue to, you know, call him weird, or call that out, or make this pitch that we are significantly different, and our policies can improve your lives,' Walz said.\n\nWhat the governor has found since the 2024 election is that - with non-voters especially - Americans didn't get that. \n\n'Look, there's not second place trophy in this. It's zero-sum,' Walz noted. 'But when I got asked, he said, \"would you do anything different?\" Yes, we would have won, that's what I would do different.' \n\n'But what I am most interested in is that you run for these jobs to improve people's lives,' he continued, noting that under Trump, 'I don't believe their lives are going to be improved.' \n\nHe said he's gone to town halls recently to 'try and understand why did you not believe that before November.' \n\nAnd the response Walz got: 'What difference does it make, they're all the same.","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

While the Trump administration has been adamant that he is a dangerous gang member, Abrego Garcia has no known gang-related convictions, and his legal team said the claims aren't true. \n\nEarlier this month, the Supreme Court ruled that Trump must bring Abrego Garcia home, and correct its error. However, the Trump administration and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele have refused to do so.Still, Trump seemed to trip over his own words when Moran asked about the fake image – and instead of giving an answer took a personal shot at the journalist.\n\n\"That was Photoshopped? Terry you can't do that,\" Trump scolded. \n\nHe continued: \"Hey, they’re giving you the big break of a lifetime. You’re doing the interview. \n\n\"I picked you because—frankly I never heard of you, but that’s OK. I picked you, but you’re not being very nice.\"On Wednesday's episode of The View, it was Behar's turn to not be nice. \n\nAddressing the behavior, she sarcastically said: \"He doesn’t even recognize his own fake images at this point!\n\n\"But here’s what I say, I watched the whole thing, and I’m really starting to feel sorry for him. He's over his head. The simplest questions he cannot answer. \n\nBehar did give Trump a bit of credit on his immigration moves, admitting the new rules and laws are \"maybe where he’s been somewhat successful.\"\n\nThen she defended her ABC colleague.\n\n\"And then he turns on Terry Moran when he asks, 'How dare you ask me a question I can’t answer?' I mean, the guy is over his head, and he knows it. I feel bad for him now — or, as he would say, badly.\"It's no secret the ladies of The View are anti-MAGA and often take the opportunity to dunk on Trump in the months leading up to and after the most recent election.\n\nThe day after Trump was declared victorious over Democratic challenger Kamala Harris, co-host Whoopi Goldberg made it clear she wasn't intending on changing her perspective of Trump, regardless of the results.\n\nShe told her co-hosts and viewers: \"He's now the president. I'm still not going to say his name. That's not going to change.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Sunny Hostin added she was \"profoundly disturbed\" by the results, while placing blame on \"uneducated white women\" for his re-election.","summary":"Joy Behar said she feels sorry for President Trump after he stumbled to answer questions during an ABC News interview.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/view-joy-behar-trump-president-abc-news-interview/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/VHRfYuLzz/0x0/joy-behar-donald-trump-1746049002831.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 23:00:00","author":"Daniel Gura","authors":["Daniel Gura"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.468},{"id":316590448,"title":"Democrats Have 'Little Appetite' for Kamala Harris After Election: Analyst","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is scheduled to deliver her first major speech following her 2024 presidential election loss to Donald Trump, and analysts discussed her political prospects, with one saying that Democrats have \"little appetite\" for her.Newsweek reached out to Harris via online form for comment ahead of the speech.Why It MattersFollowing her election loss in November and Trump's inauguration in January, Harris has kept a somewhat low political profile.Democrats have also faced growing turmoil and scrutiny following the election loss, as the party struggles with delivering a cohesive message and a leader who resonates with voters. After the 2024 election, Republicans gained control of the White House, Senate and Congress.In early polls surveying Americans on potential 2028 candidates, Harris has been a notable contender along with New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, California Governor Gavin Newsom and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.What To KnowHarris is slated to be the keynote speaker at Emerge America's 20th anniversary gala in San Francisco Wednesday night. Emerge America is an organization aimed at helping women implement change in politics.When asked if Harris could rally the Democratic Party around her following the election loss and in the immediate time of uncertainty for the party, Grant Reeher, political science professor at Syracuse University, told Newsweek via email, \"In short, no.\"Reeher continued: \"That polling is mostly picking up name recognition. Many Democrats—including some really influential leaders like Nancy Pelosi—believe that part of the problem in 2024 was the candidates at the top of the ticket, and the way they were chosen (without an open, competitive process). I think there will be little appetite to return to someone who lost to Donald Trump. That was Biden's main theory of the case in 2024, that he was the Democrat who demonstrated that he could beat Trump.\"If I were advising Democrats on 2028, I'd encourage them to avoid the people on the two coasts, and also steer away from an emphasis on social and cultural issues. I'd be looking for senators and governors in the interior of the country, like Amy Klobuchar, Elissa Slotkin, or Gretchen Whitmer,\" Reeher concluded.Columbia University Political Science Professor Robert Y. Shapiro also told Newsweek via email, \"While she may give a great speech, first I do not think Democratic leaders will rally around her.\"Continuing, Shapiro said Harris \"was damaged as a presidential candidate by the 2024 election. And without leaders weighing in in her favor I do not think a great many voters will pay much attention to her at this early stage before the next presidential election. They are looking for new leaders and there are others to consider.\"What People Are SayingHarris on X, formerly Twitter, praising New Jersey Democratic Senator Cory Booker for his impassioned speech against the Trump administration: \"The true measure of a leader is not based on who you beat down but on who you lift up. For over 24 hours, my friend @CoryBooker stood on the floor of the Senate and lifted up the voices of the American people harmed by the current administration. We must continue to fight for the best of who we are as Americans.

Brian Kemp must depart.\n\nShe’s teased such a run for months, declaring that “all options are on the table,” insisting she’d “look at all the opportunities” and “evaluate” how she could “best serve.”\n\nNow, as she continues to drop hints, Peach State Democrats worry that yet another Abrams attempt at the governor’s mansion would consign them to yet another defeat.\n\n“She’s run twice, and that’s enough to convince me she won’t win” a general election, Jimmy Johnson, former chair of the Appling County Democratic Committee, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution last week.\n\n“Can some other Democrat win? Yes.”\n\n“Abrams is great, but she missed the train,” said Marilyn Langford, another Democratic district official.\n\nThe Journal-Constitution itself piled on, as top political reporter Greg Bluestein editorialized that Abrams’ “unabashed liberal platform and relentless GOP attacks have taken a toll on the swing voters who help decide Georgia races.”\n\n“Her rematch against Kemp in 2022 ended in a resounding defeat, thanks partly to split-ticket voters who backed [Sen. Raphael] Warnock but rejected her,” Bluestein noted.\n\nPut it all together and you can’t miss the painful — or, for Republicans, painfully delicious — truth: Abrams can’t lose a Democratic primary, but can’t win a general election.\n\n“Every Georgia Democrat is scared to death Abrams runs again because they know they can’t beat her in the primary,” said Cody Hall, an adviser to Kemp. \n\n“But she’s also probably their worst candidate in the general.”\n\nOne might pity the Democrats and their media allies, were this quandary not entirely of their own making.\n\nAfter all, while they may quietly be acknowledging the readily apparent truth that Abrams is political fool’s gold, the product of a years-long crusade to make a mendacious mediocrity out to be something more, they’re the ones who embarked upon it.\n\nFirst, there was her high-profile 2018 campaign, during which a bevy of prominent Democrats — including Bernie Sanders, Hillary Clinton and then-Sen. Kamala Harris — all interceded on her behalf.\n\nThe Washington Post christened her “Democrats’ newest Southern hope,” and The New York Times insisted there was “more to” Abrams “than meets partisan eyes.”\n\nThen, after she fell short by a 1.4% margin, her boosters all parroted Abrams’ meritless charge that the election had been stolen from her.\n\nJust hours after the polls closed, the Times published a guest essay by a voter-suppression expert alleging that Abrams had faced “the rising swamp of Neo-Jim Crow” in her loss.\n\nA full year later, the Post produced a “fact check” defending Pete Buttigieg’s claim that “racially motivated patterns of voter suppression are responsible for Stacey Abrams not being governor of Georgia right now.”\n\nThe charade went on.\n\nThere were over-the-top photo shoots (she wore a cape!).\n\nThere was a “Star Trek” cameo (she wore a cape and played the president of Earth!).\n\nThere were glowing profiles (including one, in 2020, that that compared her to “a runway supermodel”).\n\nThere was speculation she might be Joe Biden’s vice president (a fire she helped fuel).\n\nBut while there’s been plenty of evidence of Abrams’ supreme skill at self-promotion, what we have never seen is any demonstration of the political talent ascribed to her.\n\nIn 2022, she ran for governor again — only to be embarrassed by Kemp, who beat her by a punishing 7.5 percentage points.\n\nAnd these days, Abrams is haunted not only by the ghosts of her electoral failures past, but by scandal.\n\nIn January, the Georgia Ethics Commission unanimously slapped Abrams’ New Georgia Project nonprofit with a $300,000 campaign-finance fine — the largest in state history — for illegally doing election work on behalf of her 2018 campaign.\n\nYou know, the same one in which she claimed Republicans were up to no good. \n\nProjection remains the surest sign of guilt.\n\nThen there’s the shady $2 billion-with-a-b federal grant the Biden administration gave to an environmental group that Abrams played a “pivotal” role in securing — a grant that’s now under investigation by President Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency, and from which Abrams in recent days has tried desperately to distance herself.\n\nAmong elite Democrats in the know, patience with Abrams — for her losses, her excuses, her campaign-finance shenanigans and her pork-barrel grifting — may at long last be running thin.\n\nBut the bells they have pealed for her cannot be un-rung — and the extensive energy they’ve expended to turn Abrams into a progressive folk hero seems poised to backfire, again.\n\nIsaac Schorr is a staff writer at Mediaite.","summary":"Democrats are quietly acknowledging the readily apparent truth that Georgia's Stacey Abrams is political fool’s gold — but they’re the ones who made her a star.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/30/opinion/stacey-abrams-is-the-democrats-self-made-nightmare/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103603599.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 22:11:22","author":"Isaac Schorr","authors":["Isaac Schorr"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.289},{"id":316592982,"title":"LIVE: Kamala Harris speaks at the Emerge Gala in San Francisco (Video)","text":"Watch live as former Vice President Kamala Harris delivers remarks the day after President Donald Trump reached 100 days in office.

After 100 days, few of them regret it. | Opinion - USA Today","text":"I realize this may blow Democrats' minds, but 100 days into President Donald Trump’s second term, most of the millions of Americans who cast their vote for him are still happy they did.\n\nAnd Trump has not been twiddling his thumbs in these first months back in the Oval Office. \n\nThere’s plenty to like or dislike, from his large number of executive orders to his federal cost-cutting bonanza with Tesla CEO Elon Musk.\n\nSo, it’s telling that a recent poll shows the vast majority of Trump supporters would vote for him again now, if given the opportunity for a do-over.\n\nAnd significantly more people are happy with the direction of the country now than they were before Trump took office. The gap between those who think the country is on the wrong track and those who think it's on the right track has shrank from 36 points in November to fewer than 12 now.\n\nTrump is delivering on what he said he would do, and, for the most part, his voters appreciate it. \n\nWithin weeks, Trump secured the border that his predecessor, Joe Biden, had left wide open. The Trump administration also is deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records. \n\nOn economic matters, Trump is following through in a big way with his promise of tariffs, and polls show that he’s testing how far inflation-weary Americans are willing to endure the president’s risky gamble.\n\nAs tariffs (and the subsequent threat of much higher prices) have become a reality, Trump’s approval numbers have dropped since he took office, even when it comes to the economy – a traditionally strong category for him.\n\nSo while Trump should not ignore the warning signs, it’s far from all bad news 100 days in.\n\nOnly 2% of Trump voters 'regret' their choice and would 'vote differently'\n\nA president’s approval numbers are usually mercurial, and move up and down depending on what’s happened in recent days. That’s why a poll from this month caught my eye. \n\nA University of Massachusetts Amherst/YouGov poll released April 14 asked voters how they felt about their presidential choice, three months into Trump’s term. \n\nThe survey found that only 2% of Trump voters regret their choice and would “vote differently” now if they could. \n\nThat’s telling and speaks to more lasting support for the president and his agenda. \n\nAnother telling number is that only 1% of Trump voters say they’d rather not have voted at all. Yet, when it comes to Kamala Harris, the former vice president and Democratic nominee, 14% of her voters say they’d rather have not taken part. \n\nCNN data analyst Harry Enten said this poll belies a common refrain in the media that a lot of Republicans regret voting for Trump. \n\n“So the bottom line is this: If there’s some idea out there that Trump voters are going around, ‘Man, I wish I had voted for Kamala Harris instead of Donald Trump,’ the numbers say that is a fanciful universe,” Enten observed. “It really, for the most part, does not exist.”\n\nDemocrats still can't get over fact Trump is president. But they have only themselves to blame.\n\nThis fairytale, in which any conservative would have been persuaded to vote for a true-blue progressive like Harris, is annoying to say the least. \n\nYet, I have heard from many Democrats in recent months, scolding me for not having the “virtue” to support their candidate. Every time Trump does something they don’t like (which is all the time), I get angry emails saying “you voted for this.”\n\nFor one thing, I never said whom I voted for, because it’s no one’s business but mine. In this role, I advocate for a set of principles I believe in – and I make decisions on whom to support based on how the candidate aligns with my beliefs. \n\nNo one is perfect. Trump isn’t perfect. And I disagree with plenty that he’s done and the way in which he’s done it, most strongly on the tariffs. \n\nThere’s a much higher chance, however, that Trump will do something I support than Harris or Biden would have. \n\nAnd Democrats have only themselves to blame for the Trump−Harris matchup. After they spent years lying to the American people about Biden’s health, they swapped Harris for Biden in a last-minute ploy that voters didn’t appreciate. \n\nHarris compounded the problem with her inability to put two coherent sentences together or to differentiate herself from her boss.\n\nShe would have been a terrible president, and not the president we needed to secure the border or strengthen the economy, which faltered under the Biden-Harris White House. \n\nVoters who chose Trump put a lot of faith in his ability to fix these things. \n\nHe must not let them down. \n\nIngrid Jacques is a columnist at USA TODAY.

Harris has been silent about her political future amid speculation that she’ll run for governor of California in 2026 — early polls suggest she’d be a front-runner — or campaign for president again in 2028. In the meantime, she has rarely taken the public stage.\n\nThe prominent Democrat’s quietude will end Wednesday night when she makes her first major speech since the election.\n\nHarris is slated to make the keynote address at a San Francisco hotel at the 20th anniversary gala of Emerge America, an influential political organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for local and national office.

The gala begins at 7 p.m. PDT.\n\nHarris has close ties with Emerge America, which sprouted in part from her first successful campaign in 2002 for San Francisco district attorney. The group has helped elect 1,200 Emerge alums to office nationally, according to its website, including U.S. Rep. Lateefah Simon of Oakland and a slew of other members of Congress.\n\nIts 20th anniversary gathering is Harris’ chosen venue to start raising her public profile after the defeat.

Harris has been mulling a run in California's gubernatorial race and will make a decision by the end of summer, two sources familiar with her plans told ABC News in March.\n\nSome Democrats have also floated her as a potential 2028 presidential candidate, although some of her longtime supporters have told ABC News they are torn over that prospect.\n\nWhether she runs for either office or not, Harris' public remarks thus far have sometimes included veiled and explicit swipes at the Trump administration and the president himself.\n\nIn remarks at a women of color leaders summit in early April, she weighed in on the second Trump administration, saying \"there is a sense of fear that has been taking hold in our country\" but that \"courage is also contagious.\"\n\nAnd in remarks at the NAACP Image Awards in February, Harris framed the \"chapter\" America is in as one that \"will be written not simply by whoever occupies the oval office nor by the wealthiest among us.

Though fake profiles have long been used to scam undiscerning internet users, a growing trend of live-video fakes fueled by AI is targeting the young and old alike.\n\nCalled \"realtime deepfakes\" — deepfakes referring to spoofed images that are growing nearly impossible to distinguish from real life — scammers are now altering their appearance and voices in live videos.

One video they obtained showed a young Black man appearing as a white guy with a grey beard to a woman he was talking to over Facetime. Another showed a man appearing as a younger woman.\n\nOnce a scammer secures their target's confidence through their lifelike voice and appearance, the actual fraud can begin. 404 notes the users of this tech typically deploy romance scams, Medicare fraud, and photo verification schemes.\n\nAnother horrifying example called the \"grandparent scam\" involves criminals impersonating a loved one's voice in order to coerce a payout or con an elderly person into revealing sensitive info, which can then be used to access secure accounts. \"I was anxious to get the money out; I'd do anything for my grandchildren,\" said one Canadian grandmother who'd been targeted for $9,000 in Canadian dollars.\n\nIt's easy to rag on the elderly, but the growing sophistication of these tools means that young people, too, are highly susceptible. Research in 2021, for instance, found that the younger generations of gen Z, millennials and gen X were 34 percent more likely to have lost money to fraud than people over the age of 60, though they were more likely to have been conned by fake products and crypto schemes than romance scams.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election also caused mountains of deepfake slop to rain down on social media.\n\nUsed to spread memes and disinformation alike, deepfake tools allowed posters like Elon Musk to spoof figures such as Kamala Harris denigrating herself. The line with parody can be blurry; one viral example is the infamous Trump/Biden duet, in which the two political rivals sing a tender Mandarin love song to each other.\n\nOther examples abound, like one audio deepfake that purported to show a Baltimore area principal making derogatory and racist comments, and a financial worker who forked out $25 million after scammers faked a multi-person Zoom call, including an AI fake of the company's chief financial officer.\n\nIf celebrities, financial workers, and entire communities can find themselves at the mercy of unscrupulous deepfakers, what chances do our elderly have of resisting deepfake scams?\n\nMore on deepfakes: AI Startup Deletes Entire Website After Researcher Finds Something Disgusting There","summary":"Let's face it: it's never been a particularly good time to be an elderly internet user.

A similar percentage of those who backed Vice President Kamala Harris (93%) said the same. \n\nThat gives Trump a one-point popular vote edge, 48%-47% — almost in line with the actual outcome (49.8%-48.3%)\n\n“Despite several unpopular domestic and foreign policies, President Trump still holds an entrenched base of voters who, if given the chance, say they would vote for him again,” explained Spencer Kimball, executive director of Emerson College Polling.\n\nTrump, 78, became the first Republican in two decades to win the popular vote in a presidential contest.\n\nThe poll was released hours before Harris, 60, makes her much-anticipated return to the political spotlight Wednesday evening with her first major address since losing to Trump\n\nEmerson also found Americans were evenly divided about Trump, with 45% approving of his work as president and 45% disapproving. \n\nA deluge of polling has pegged Trump with the lowest approval rating of any president at their 100-day mark in decades.\n\nIncensed by the brutal findings, Trump has suggested that some of the pollsters behind the “fake polls from fake news organizations” should be investigated.\n\nTrump’s popularity troubles are largely driven by growing consternation about the economy, which he routinely touted during both his first term and the 2024 campaign. \n\nEmerson found that Trump had a positive favorability rating in just two of nine policy areas: immigration (45% approval, 44% disapproval) and higher education (45% approval, 36% disapproval).\n\nAmericans were least impressed with his handling of the Russia-Ukraine War (27% approval, 52% disapproval), the Israel-Hamas war (30% approval, 46% disapproval), tariff policy (34% approval, 51% disapproval), and the US economy (37% approval, 49% disapproval).\n\nJust over one in five voters (21%) approved of Trump’s handling of cryptocurrency. Trump has been a champion of digital, having launched his own memecoin while his team recently invited the top 220 donors to a private dinner with him.\n\n“Areas of concern for the president include economic and foreign policy, with voters disapproving of his actions on tariffs and in the Russia-Ukraine war, while voters continue to be divided on immigration and deportation policy,” Kimball explained.\n\nWhile the general public appears to be growing increasingly skeptical of Trump, the poll noted, his Republican base is standing steadfastly behind him.\n\n“Trump’s base of Republican voters consider his second term to be more of a success, 86% to 14%, whereas Democrats consider it a failure, 88% to 12%,” Kimball continued. “Independents are more divided, with 55% to 45% considering it more of a failure.”\n\nThe Emerson College Polling sampled 1,000 registered voters between April 25-28 with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.","summary":"According to the Emerson College poll of registered voters, 94% of Trump voters said they would do so again if they were given the chance to go back in time to Nov. 5 knowing what they know now.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/04/30/us-news/trump-would-still-beat-harris-in-2024-revote-survey-finds/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/103602661.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/jBBsfIZS-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-04-30 19:53:43","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.227},{"id":316559252,"title":"Kamala Harris delivers keynote address in first major speech since losing 2024 election","text":"New York Post\n\n See All Videos \n\nKamala Harris delivers keynote address in first major speech since losing 2024 election\n\nApril 30, 2025 | 3:50pm\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris is set to make her first major speech since losing to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, in which she is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America in San Francisco at 10 p.m. EST.\n\n Share thison","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris is set to make her first major speech since losing to Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election, in which she is scheduled to deliver the keynote address at the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America in San Francisco at 10 p.m. EST.","url":"https://nypost.com/video/kamala-harris-delivers-keynote-address-in-first-major-speech-since-losing-2024-election/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/04/kamala.png?w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 19:50:55","author":"New York Post Video","authors":["New York Post Video"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.585},{"id":316572192,"title":"WATCH: Tucker Carlson tells Megyn Kelly what kind of Democrat ‘could easily get elected’ in 2028","text":"Daily Caller News Foundation co-founder Tucker Carlson told SiriusXM’s Megyn Kelly Tuesday that a Democrat who mirrors President Donald Trump’s economic policies would “easily” be the party’s hope for 2028.\n\nDemocrats have struggled to gain momentum since Trump’s win in November 2024, appearing unable to unite behind a leading candidate. On “The Megyn Kelly Show,” the two discussed California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s potential to lead the Democrats in 2028.\n\nCarlson said he believes Newsom is “legit smart,” adding he’s known the Democrat governor for a while. Carlson, though, said he doubted Newsom’s 2028 chances after Kelly asked whether he could be the “Dems’ great white hope from California for 2028.”\n\n“He’s pretty white. I mean, it’s the anti-white party,” Carlson said. “They hate white people. They’ve been systematically disenfranchising white people from the country they were born in. They say that out loud. That’s what diversity is. It’s everybody but white men. So I’m not whining about it.”\n\n“I’m just noticing that [it’s] much more comprehensive than Jim Crow ever was. So for the party that did that, that set up this Jim Crow system, anti-white system to nominate another white guy. I mean, maybe? But I think they’d be much happier with AOC. I don’t take her that seriously. I’m not really sure what I think,” Carlson added.\n\nSpeculation has circulated that both Newsom and Democrat New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have already begun to eye their party’s presidential nomination.\n\nAccording to a CNN/SSRS poll released on March 16, the party only hit a 29% favorability rating among respondents.\n\n“I think what is likely to happen — someone’s going to come out of nowhere who’s got native talent. I continue to believe [that] even in the Democratic Party you have to have talent to succeed. I felt that Bernie Sanders had a lot of talent,” Carlson said. “I don’t agree with him, of course, but I did think he had a lot of talent. Then it turned out he was a fraud also. But [for] someone like Bernie Sanders, I think populist economics is very popular.”\n\n“Actually, conservatives don’t want to admit it, but it is popular. So someone who comes out and attacks the credit card companies, attacks the endless war, basically does kind of [like] Trump on the left. That person could easily get elected,” Carlson said.\n\nKelly asked Carlson for his thoughts regarding Ocasio-Cortez’s potential shot at securing her party’s nomination. Despite Carlson saying he believes “she’s got a ton of talent,” he questioned whether Ocasio-Cortez has the “enormous self-discipline to get through a presidential campaign.”\n\n“I also think the Israel thing is tough, is tough for anybody running in that party,” Carlson said. “A lot of rank-and file-Democrats are genuinely mad about the Gaza thing. Donors obviously are on a different page. So it’s a fundamental split in that party. I’m not exactly sure how that’s resolved, and I’m not sure that she can walk that line.”\n\nAccording to a CNN/SSRS poll from March, over 30% of respondents were unable to name a Democrat leader they felt “best reflects the core values” of the party.\n\nOf those who were willing to write in a name, 10% chose Ocasio-Cortez, 9% selected former Vice President Kamala Harris, 8% said Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and 6% selected House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries. Additionally, 4% each named former President Barack Obama and Texas Rep. Jasmine Crockett, with 2% writing in Schumer along with a handful of other names.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

However, I do not agree that a president should fire a Federal Reserve chair because they refuse to follow orders to cut rates faster.\n\nInterest rates are the price of money—and government price-setting never works, whether it's done by central bankers or politicians. Artificially low interest rates are what caused the Great Depression, the housing bubble, the post-COVID surge in consumer prices, and every downturn that has occurred since Congress made the mistake of creating a central bank in 1913. \n\nForcing interest rates lower than their true market rate leads builders to start massive construction projects, companies to expand recklessly, and consumers to take on mortgages and debt they can't really afford. In the short term, it looks like a boom—jobs grow, markets rise, and politicians pat themselves on the back. But it's a house built on sand.\n\nEventually, reality sets in. The malinvestments—investments that made sense only under distorted interest rates—are exposed. Housing developments sit empty. Borrowers default. Banks tighten credit. And then the crash comes.\n\nTo fix the housing industry, Trump doesn't need to increase economic intervention—he just needs to unleash the housing market. Fortunately, he has already gotten started.\n\nHis day one executive order on \"Delivering Emergency Price Relief for American Families and Defeating the Cost-of-Living Crisis\" aims to slash through the tangled web of state and local regulations that choke off new housing supply. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum also announced a joint task force to build new homes on federal land. \n\nTrump also seems to believe in letting housing markets operate efficiently so supply can rise to meet demand. His administration can help make that happen by ending the previous administration's Department of Justice (DOJ) antitrust lawsuit against the software firm RealPage, which it alleged helped landlords artificially raise rents.\n\nIn reality, this software helps property owners better understand their market rate valuations (much like Kelley Blue Book does for car owners and buyers). Yet, time and time again on the campaign trail, former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris falsely claimed this pricing software was driving up costs for renters—an attempt to shift blame for high prices away from the government and the Fed. \n\nBlaming pricing software for rising rents is like blaming the thermometer for a fever. It's not landlords' and homeowners' fault that inflation under Biden's watch forced them to raise their prices. \n\nOnce Trump succeeds in achieving zoning and permitting reform, this innovative new pricing technology will help reduce home prices faster. Why? Because deregulation lowers prices, and this software provides real-time market pricing. That's why fending off this Biden-era regulatory overreach is so important. Innovation helps drive prices down. \n\nDeregulation is almost always the answer. Interventionism is not. We must stop depending on central bankers to \"fix\" the economy with levers and dials. Every manipulated boom leads to a bust. Every time Washington intervenes, it creates distortions that punish savers, reward speculation, and ultimately hurt the very people it claims to want to help.\n\nThe real solution isn't more planning—it's more freedom. Let markets set interest rates. Let prices rise and fall. Let supply and demand work without interference. That's not just sound policy—it's sound money.","summary":"Former Rep.

As for the press being deceived, anyone with eyes, ears, and sanity saw and heard Biden shake hands with the air upon completing a speech and experience difficulty finding his way off the stage. \n\nBiden was also an octogenarian who claimed to have conversations with world leaders who died years ago, couldn’t remember the names of his Cabinet members, and was told to call only on hand-picked reporters during the rare occasions he would hold a press conference. \n\nYet Thompson and other media members are saying they were “misled” by the Biden White House. Please. They all knew. The hope was that Biden would survive the June 27, 2024, debate against President Donald Trump in Atlanta or at least count on Trump being the focus of negative coverage, and then run the 2020 playbook of doing the bare minimum of campaigning and interviews, and vanquish Trump on Nov. 5. \n\nOf course, none of that happened. The craziest month in presidential campaign history began the night of the Biden-Trump debate. It included Trump nearly being assassinated on July 13, Trump’s surprising selection of Vice President JD Vance on July 15 at the Republican National Convention, and Biden dropping out on July 21. Forty-eight hours later, Democrats coalesced around former Vice President Kamala Harris, the most unpopular vice president in polling history. \n\nThis was the ultimate bias of omission, stemming from a visceral loathing of Trump. \n\nUltimately, Biden was exposed at the debate in Atlanta, and we got Harris as the nominee. She went on to blow $1.5 billion in campaign funds in under 100 days, only to lose the popular vote and every swing state, all while Republicans took back the Senate and held the House.\n\nSo, how are other media members responding to Thompson’s semi-admonishment of them at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner? They’re mostly in denial, with former Meet the Press and MSNBC host Chuck Todd leading the way with arguably the most tone-deaf analysis possible.\n\n“I just refuse to accept this stupid premise because it’s a right-wing-manufactured, right-wing premise in order to sustain the media,” Todd recently argued to former CNN pundit Chris Cillizza on his Substack channel. \n\n“This is an attempt by some to virtue-signal, and it’s this horrible sort of pitting different news organizations against each other when ultimately the people at fault are Chuck Schumer, Nancy Pelosi, Jill Biden, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, every elected member of Congress,” he added.\n\n“Did the media not show him being old, not show him shuffling, not show him using the baby staircase? No, you know why that’s all out there? Because the media f***ing showed it,” he continued.\n\nOh please. For starters, blaming the media for not covering one of the biggest stories of our lifetime isn’t a “right-wing-manufactured, right-wing premise,” but an accurate one. Schumer, Pelosi, Jill Biden, Harris, and Congress didn’t suddenly learn how to do a Jedi mind trick and hypnotize the press into believing Biden had the mental prowess of Stephen Hawking and the physical attributes of Sequon Barkley. Politicians lie and exaggerate all the time, but in this case, the evidence was apparent for all to see. One didn’t need to take anyone at their word. \n\nAs for Todd’s argument that the media showed Biden shuffling or using the baby staircase, sure, it did. But those instances were always couched with admonishment for anyone daring to question his mental decline. \n\nTwo days before Biden’s disastrous debate performance in Atlanta, then-CNN media “reporter” Oliver Darcy said, “For years, and particularly over the last few months, MAGA Media has portrayed Biden as a senile, mentally incapacitated elderly man who cannot remember what he had for breakfast, let alone run the federal government. That might sound like an exaggeration to those who don’t tune in to Fox News or listen to talk radio, but it has been a real and constant theme in the right-wing media universe.”\n\n“To support the narrative, these outlets and personalities have seized on Biden’s verbal gaffes (while ignoring Trump’s) and presented out-of-context video clips to their large audiences — a deceptive, but effective strategy that the Biden campaign has struggled to meaningfully rebut,” he added. \n\nThat aged well, didn’t it? \n\nHow about this beauty from Joe Scarborough in the spring of 2024?\n\n“Start your tape right now, because I’m about to tell you the truth,” the Morning Joe host implored his viewers. “And eff you if you can’t handle the truth. This version of Biden, intellectually, analytically, is the best Biden ever. Not a close second. And I’ve known him for years.”\n\nThat aged like milk left in a sauna. \n\nThen there was the “cheap fakes” narrative pushed by former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre six days before the debate, which was also aggressively pushed by some of the country’s top newspapers. \n\n“Videos of Biden are clearly manipulated to make him look old and confused,” the New York Times reported on June 21, 2024.\n\n“How Republicans used misleading videos to attack Biden in a 24-hour period,” said the Washington Post‘s front-page headline on June 11, 2024, with the subheadline: Such deceptively edited videos, known as “cheap fakes,” have become staples of Republican attacks against the president.\n\nSo no, Todd, the media got it completely wrong by showing the footage you mentioned of Biden, only to frame such instances as cheap fakes because the Biden White House told them to. It’s that simple. \n\nAs for learning any lessons, don’t hold your breath. A Media Research Center analysis found that Trump’s first 100 days were covered to the tune of 92% positive on ABC, NBC, and CBS. Meanwhile, Biden’s first 100 days generated 59% positive coverage. Add it up, and that’s a 151-point swing from positive to negative. \n\nDEMOCRATS THINK A REBRAND WILL WIN MEN AND THE WORKING CLASS\n\nLegacy media didn’t miss Biden’s brain turning to apple sauce. They purposely and willingly ignored it or excused it. \n\nAll the remorse and mea culpa in the world over Biden won’t change the fact that the public will likely never trust them again.","summary":"&#8220;Being truth-tellers also means telling the truth about ourselves.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said she’d talked to the president about the report and called the move “hostile and political.” She accused Amazon of partnering with a “Chinese propaganda arm,” referencing a 2021 Reuters report about Amazon removing reviews on President Xi Jinping's speeches and writing.\nThe two billionaires appear to have quickly hashed it out over a phone call after a reportedly “pissed” Trump called Bezos. And Amazon released a statement saying it had only ever considered the tariff feature—which it didn’t go forward with—for its low-cost store.\nAfter the ordeal, Trump had only good things to say about Bezos. “He was terrific,” Trump told reporters. “He solved a problem very quickly, and he did the right thing, and he’s a good guy.”\nThe brief lover’s quarrel was a bit of déjà vu from Trump’s first term in office. But the speedy resolution is an indicator of just how much has changed since then. Here’s a look back at how the relationship between Trump and Bezos has turned from sour to sweet.\n#SendDonaldtoSpace\nThe spat between Trump and Bezos dates back to at least 2015, when Trump was still running for the Republican presidential nomination, and tweets were still 140 characters. It was around that time that Trump began trolling Bezos, accusing him of using the Washington Post as a “tax shelter” for Amazon. “The @washingtonpost loses money (a deduction) and gives owner @JeffBezos power to screw public on low taxation of @Amazon!” Trump wrote, likely in retaliation for the Post’s critical coverage of his campaign.\nBezos, who was still willing to stand up for that coverage, quickly clapped back: “Finally trashed by @realDonaldTrump. Will still reserve him a seat on the Blue Origin rocket. #sendDonaldtospace,” Bezos wrote, along with a link to a video of his space company’s recent rocket landing.\n“We Can’t Let Him Get Away with it.”\nThe Trump-Bezos dynamic was hardly any chummier once Trump clinched the nomination, and began calling for antitrust scrutiny into Bezos’s businesses. In an interview with Sean Hannity in May 2016, Trump accused Bezos of “getting away with murder tax-wise.” He argued Bezos was using the Post “as a tool for political power against me and against other people” and said, “We can’t let him get away with it.”\nThe Post’s then executive editor, Martin Baron, stood up for the paper’s editorial independence from Bezos, saying at the time that he had “received no instructions from Jeff Bezos regarding our coverage of the presidential campaign—or, for that matter, any other subject.”\nBezos backed that sentiment in his own interview with Baron, also in May 2016, saying that Trump’s ranting against the Post was “not an appropriate way for a presidential candidate to behave.” “We want a society where any of us, any individual or institution, if they choose to, can scrutinize, examine and criticize an elected official, especially a candidate for the highest office in the most powerful country on Earth. It’s critical,” he said. “What would be shocking and disturbing is if you weren’t doing that.” Shocking and disturbing, indeed!\nThe Battle of the Postal Service\nBezos extended an olive branch to Trump after the 2016 election, saying he would give the new president his “most open mind.” But Trump wasn’t interested in making nice and continued to hammer on about Amazon’s alleged tax evasion on Twitter. Those attacks escalated when Trump began laying pressure on the US Postal Service to raise shipping rates on Amazon, causing its stock price to slide.\nOnce the pandemic hit, Trump threatened to withhold desperately needed funding from the Postal Service, unless it hiked prices on Amazon. “Every time they bring a package, they lose money on it,” Trump said at the time, arguing the Postal Service should “raise the price of a package by approximately four times.\"\nThe Empire Strikes Bezos\nArguably the biggest battle between Trump and Bezos was over a $10 billion Pentagon contract codenamed JEDI, which the Trump administration awarded to Microsoft in 2019. Shortly after, Amazon sued the administration over the snub, arguing that the president’s “personal vendetta” against Bezos had cost Amazon Web Services the contract. The lawsuit referenced reporting from a book on Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in which Trump allegedly told Mattis to “screw Amazon” out of the JEDI deal.\nIn a blog post about the case, Amazon lashed out at Trump’s “blatant cronyism.”\n“The President has removed perceived political threats from their roles simply for doing their jobs,” the post read. “A similar pattern has emerged within the [Department of Defense] as senior military leadership cannot exercise their sound judgment without facing retribution, “The President has become emboldened of late in flaunting his role influencing government contracts for politically motivated reasons.”\nAfter the Pentagon cancelled the contract altogether, the courts dismissed the lawsuit as moot.\nThe Post-Presidency Thaw\nApart from the fight over the JEDI contract, Trump and Bezos’s squabbles quieted to a simmer during the Biden years, likely because Trump himself was banned from the social platforms where he did most of his Bezos-bashing. This period also aligned with Bezos’s own personal transformation, including his decision to step down as CEO of Amazon in 2021, though he remains the company’s executive chair.\nThe Biden Administration hardly had a friendly relationship with Amazon. President Joe Biden appointed famed Amazon critic Lina Khan to chair the Federal Trade Commission, which proceeded to file a lawsuit against the e-commerce giant (and pretty much every other tech giant), accusing it of “illegally maintaining monopoly power.” That suit remains ongoing. It’s unclear how much the Biden administration’s crackdown on tech monopolies played into Bezos’s sudden political shift, but by the time the 2024 election rolled around, he was already courting Trump’s affections.\nThe day of Trump’s attempted assassination in Butler, Pennsylvania, Bezos tweeted that Trump had “showed tremendous grace and courage under literal fire,” and according to Axios, the two men had a phone call shortly after that formed the basis of their bromance.\nAn \"Extraordinary Political Comeback”\nAs the 2024 election neared, Bezos’s once hands-off-approach to the Post’s journalism unraveled when he spiked the paper’s endorsement of Kamala Harris. It was the first time the Post had declined to endorse a candidate since the 1980s. In an op-ed explaining the decision, Bezos wrote that endorsements create “a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence.” The decision reportedly cost the Post hundreds of thousands of subscribers.\nOf course, Bezos didn’t seem quite so concerned about the “perception of bias” when, after the election, he and Sanchez dined with Trump and Elon Musk at Mar-a-Lago, or when Amazon donated $1 million to Trump’s inaugural fund, or when he stood behind Trump on the dais as he took the oath of office in January.\n“Personal Liberties and Free Markets”\nBy February of this year, Bezos’s political realignment was clear—and if it hadn’t been, he certainly made it so when he published a memo on the new direction of the Post’s op-ed page. “We are going to be writing every day in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,” he wrote in a message he shared on X. “We’ll cover other topics too of course, but viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others.”\nThe Post has since seen an exodus of top talent, including the editor of the opinion section, David Shipley. Bezos wrote that he had offered Shipley “the opportunity to lead this new chapter,” but that “if the answer wasn’t ‘hell yes,’ then it had to be ‘no.’”\nApart from the minor tiff about tariffs, the formerly rocky relationship between Trump and Bezos has been smooth over the course of Trump’s first 100 days in office. So smooth, that Blue Origin reportedly just landed a $2.3 billion NASA contract.\nSo much for #sendDonaldtospace. The president is doing just fine by Bezos here on Earth.\nDisclosure: Writer Issie Lapowsky is married to an Amazon employee.","summary":"The brief spat between the White House and Amazon Tuesday was a trip down the very rocky memory lane of the billionaires’ bromance.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/jeff-bezos-relationship-with-donald-trump","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/68125bc83aa51d60fb6b760a/16:9/w_2992,h_1683,c_limit/697904848","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 17:38:24","author":"Issie Lapowsky","authors":["Issie Lapowsky"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":316532956,"title":"Kamala Harris to Strongly Condemn Trump’s Policies in Upcoming San Francisco Speech","text":"SAN FRANCISCO — Former Vice President Kamala Harris plans to use a high-profile speech Wednesday in San Francisco to sharply criticize President Donald Trump amid speculation about whether she will mount another presidential campaign or opt to run for California governor.\n\nHarris will address the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office that grew in part from Harris’ run for San Francisco district attorney in the early 2000s.\n\nHer speech comes the day after Trump reached 100 days in office.

Presidential appointees typically serve a five-year term, according to the museum's website.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, several Biden appointees were notified of their abrupt termination from the board. The New York Times, which first reported the firings, said notices came via email from the White House Presidential Personnel Office. Tuesday was the 80th anniversary of the liberation of Nazi Germany's Dachau concentration camp. \n\nEmhoff confirmed and criticized his termination in a statement on social media, in which he wrote that \"Holocaust remembrance and education should never be politicized.\"\n\n\"To turn one of the worst atrocities in history into a wedge issue is dangerous — and it dishonors the memory of six million Jews murdered by Nazis that this museum was created to preserve,\" wrote Emhoff, whose great-grandparents fled persecution from modern-day Poland in the early 19th century.\n\nThe White House did not respond to questions about why — and how many — board members were terminated, but said Trump plans to appoint new members.\n\nIn a statement emailed to NPR, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Trump \"looks forward to appointing new individuals who will not only continue to honor the memory of those who perished in the Holocaust, but who are also steadfast supporters of the State of Israel.\"\n\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which meets twice a year, consists of 55 members appointed by the president, as well as five members each from the Senate and House of Representatives and three ex-officio members from the Departments of Education, Interior and State. \n\nIt is not clear how many board members were terminated on Tuesday. The New York Times and Associated Press report that other officials dismissed include Ron Klain, Biden's first chief of staff; Anthony Bernal, a senior advisor to former first lady Jill Biden; and Susan Rice, Biden's former domestic policy adviser and an architect of his national strategy for combating antisemitism.\n\nFormer Rep. David Cicilline, D-Rhode Island, whom Biden appointed to the board in 2024, confirmed to NPR that his position was also terminated. Cicilline — who left Congress in 2023 to run the Rhode Island Foundation — called firings \"deeply disappointing\" in an emailed statement on Wednesday.\n\n\"The Museum's work has always been nonpartisan and should remain so,\" he said. \"It is meant to challenge us all to think critically and clearly about our role in society, to confront antisemitism, and all other forms of hate.\"\n\nThe United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, which was established by Congress in 1980 and opened in 1993, is the country's official memorial to the Holocaust, dedicated to the documentation, study and interpretation of the genocide of European Jews during World War II. \n\nIt describes itself as an \"independent establishment of the United States government operating as a public-private partnership that receives some federal funding to support operations of the Museum building.\"\n\nWhen asked about the terminations, Andrew Hollinger, the museum's communication director, told NPR over email that the museum \"is gratified that our visitation is robust and demand for Holocaust education is increasing,\" especially given the rise in antisemitism and Holocaust denial or distortion.\n\n\"We look forward to continuing to advance our vitally important mission as we work with the Trump Administration,\" Hollinger wrote.\n\nBut some current and former board members, as well as prominent Jewish community leaders, say Trump's terminations will threaten the institution's ability to carry out that mission.\n\n\"Donald Trump's action to prematurely remove members of the board before the end of their terms is an attempt to politicize an institution dedicated to remembering one of the worst atrocities in our history and hurts our efforts to educate future generations,\" Nevada Sen.

On the night of May 3, fans couldn’t even absorb the potency of Drake’s “Family Matters” before Kendrick dropped the even more scathing “Meet the Grahams” 24 minutes later. The two rap icons had been in a cold war for years, but social media started buzzing once their subliminals turned into headline-worthy accusations of assault, infidelity, and hidden children. Rap fans couldn’t put their phones away. Hip-hop heads got to see two respected lyricists going for blood, and proponents of Shaderoom-style gossip had more than enough drama to feed off of.\n\n A year later, no one can get over the Kendrick and Drake beef. Stans on both sides continue to speculate and re-litigate the battle as if it were still going in real-time, convinced that their fave has one more diss in the tuck. There are communities like r/DarkKenny that have popped up to speculate on Kendrick’s seedier allegations against Drake. At the same time, Twitter’s OVO Community mounts daily evidence insisting that Drake won the duel. Drake himself refuses to move on, filing a lawsuit against UMG alleging that they artificially inflated “Not Like Us’” popularity. And in turn, Kendrick has lampooned Drake’s litigious streak during his Super Bowl LIX Halftime performance and most recently, during his Grand National Tour. \n\n No matter what any court rules, the impact of the nine-times-platinum “Not Like Us” is already too massive to roll back. “Family Matters,” which dropped the night before, was Drake’s strongest effort in the beef. Drake went low, but Kendrick got subterranean on “Meet The Grahams.” And the next day, he expertly switched the vibe with a DJ Mustard-produced slapper. It was impossible not to hear its bouncy swing, recite lines like “a minor” along with the song’s affirmatory hook, and not feel like it was a celebration, one that happened to be atop Drake’s figurative grave. Kendrick had “certified pedophile” accusations blaring through the speakers of Kamala Harris events, NBA games, and eventually the Super Bowl. It was an impeccable chess move that marked him as the victor of their week-long duel, which we’re reminded of every time it plays. \n\n So far on the Grand National tour, Kendrick has prefaced the record with a skit that plays on the set’s big screen. In the short video, Kendrick is being deposed, with a prosecutor asking him if he was familiar with the term “drop, drop, drop” — Drake’s refrain on “Family Matters.” Then, he performs the smash that’d be a disservice to his fans not to play. Even Drake played the Meek Mill diss track “Back to Back” years after it dropped.\n\n Last November, Drake filed petitions accusing UMG, iHeartRadio, and Spotify of colluding to inflate the streaming numbers and radio play of “Not Like Us.” He’s settled with iHeartRadio and Spotify, but is still at odds with UMG, amending his lawsuit last week to include Kendrick’s Super Bowl halftime performance as additional evidence of defamation. While Drake’s fans believe he’s calling UMG to account on behalf of artists, many others feel like it’s just sour grapes. His lawyers claim UMG, “approved, published, and launched a campaign to create a viral hit out of a rap track that falsely accuses Drake of being a pedophile and calls for violent retribution against him.” Still, he also issued defamatory claims against Kendrick throughout their war of words. Some fans believe he’s using the courts to penalize Kendrick’s diss, a move not far off from prosecutors using lyrics against rappers in court.\n\n As long as Drake’s litigation continues, and Kendrick continues to perform “Not Like Us,” the hip-hop community will keep talking about the beef. The rap world may hold on even longer, as we’ll likely never see anything of the same magnitude. Many of the world’s biggest rap stars no longer value lyrical supremacy, and the artists who covet their pen can’t capture the world’s attention like Drake and Kendrick’s beef did. Last year’s showdown was a perfect storm of rap superstars who were reared in the era of rap battles as a rite of passage, and just so happened to hate each other. Both felt they had to go through the other to be viewed as the “king” of their era. \n\n This is by no means the first rap feud to drag on over time. Nas and Jay-Z fans still argue about “Takeover” versus “Ether,” even as the two rap icons have been friends and collaborators longer than they were at odds. 50 Cent and Ja Rule still trade shots more than twenty years after their first skirmish. And it feels like we’re always one Pusha T subliminal away from reigniting the Drake-Pusha cold war. To quote Nas, “some beef is everlasting.” \n\n But stan culture makes Drake versus Kendrick more annoying than anything we’ve ever seen. A look back at hip-hop message boards in the heat of aughts-era rap beefs shows a simpler time. Rap fans took sides during these disagreements, but aside from the Death Row and Bad Boy clash of the nineties, which ended in tragedy, it rarely seemed like fans of yesteryear felt compelled to genuinely hate one rapper over another in a beef. But today, rap beef is propagandized by stans consumed as much by slandering their supposed enemy as celebrating their fave. The women’s rap scene is its very own Game Of Thrones, with stan clans constantly clashing in support of their girls. \n\n In the months following the Drake and Kendrick beef, fans have become hypervigilant of every piece of news, labeling each tidbit as a win (W) for their person or a loss (L) for the other. Kendrick and Drake stans argue whether the World Cup or Super Bowl Halftime Show means more, and track Kendrick and Drake’s monthly Spotify listeners as if their self-esteem is tied to the results. Years ago, rap beef was about who had the best rhymes. Now, it’s about who has deeper parasocial ties. \n\n These fans are taking cues from Drake and Kendrick’s mutual personal vitriol. On “Meet The Grahams,” Kendrick told Drake’s mom, “I think niggas like him should die;” the beef got darker and more personal than many expected. Both men manipulatively used accusations of violence against women as their main gripe against the other, turning what was supposed to be a debate about the better MC into a competition about who could sell themselves as the better person. We heard accusations about infidelity, secret children, abuse, and sex trafficking when we would’ve been fine with wordplay and height jokes. \n\n Since that fateful week last spring, devoted fans on both sides have been obsessed with proving their man right. Random children have been posted on social media in attempts to validate Kendrick’s “Meet The Grahams” claim that Drake has another child. When two women filed a sexual assault complaint against TDE executives, onlookers viewed it through the prism of an “L“ for Kendrick instead of two women being coming forward about misconduct. People plunged to conspiratorial depths about how Kendrick received the items on the “Meet the Grahams” cover, prompting journalist Christopher Alvarez to debunk salacious rumors. \n\n And that’s exactly why we should probably let it go. There’s no further depth these men can go to that’s productive for anybody. And because they were so outwardly vitriolic toward each other, we don’t have to fish for subliminals in their music. When Drake posted an ominous clip of Rasheed Wallace opining, “We will win Game 2,” fans speculated that he was about to reignite the beef. But the last time he wanted to go at it with Kendrick, he taunted him for weeks and dropped two disses. The extreme nature of last year’s exchange indicates that neither man is scared to take it there if they wanted to. Therefore, fans should stop overanalyzing every line and scene of a video as a shot at the other. If they ever want to say fuck the other guy again, we will all know.","summary":"Last May, the two rap titans went on an unprecedented spree of disses, and the hip-hop world is still buzzing","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/kendrick-drake-beef-one-year-later-1235328386/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/one-year-later-kendrick-drake.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 16:56:22","author":"Andre Gee,Jeff Ihaza","authors":["Andre Gee","Jeff Ihaza"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":316530794,"title":"Kamala Harris expected to sharply criticize Trump's policies in San Francisco speech","text":"SAN FRANCISCO -- Former Vice President Kamala Harris plans to use a high-profile speech Wednesday in San Francisco to sharply criticize President Donald Trump amid speculation about whether she will mount another presidential campaign or opt to run for California governor.\n\nHarris will address the 20th anniversary gala for Emerge America, an organization that recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office that grew in part from Harris' run for San Francisco district attorney in the early 2000s.\n\nHer speech comes the day after Trump reached 100 days in office.

Jim Jordan & Brian Mast: Rogue Judges Are Out to Stop Trump’s America First Agenda","text":"Rogue, unelected judges appointed by Democrats are weaponizing our court system to overturn the results of the 2024 presidential election. Instead of throwing out ballots, these unelected activist judges are abusing their power to bend and manipulate their courts’ jurisdiction to interpret laws in ways that obstruct President Trump’s America First agenda and keep in place the failed policies of Joe Biden.\n\nLower court judges are doing this at every opportunity, from trying to block President Trump’s effort to deport illegal migrants to preventing the firing of unaccountable bureaucrats. These judges are often operating under their own agenda and expanding their fiefdoms for partisan political purposes.\n\nA prime example of this judicial overreach is Judge Amir Ali’s ruling that the Trump administration must pay out at least $2 billion to NGOs that used American tax dollars from the State Department and USAID to bankroll liberal programs abroad. Fortunately, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Trump administration have canceled the bulk of these programs after determining they were doing nothing to advance America’s national security — and in some cases were even undermining it.\n\nA new administration must have latitude to carry out the wishes of the American people. Judge Ali’s ruling allows for no such discretion. This is not just some wonky legal argument. Judge Ali is substituting his own foreign policy interests over those of President Trump and Congress. In fact, he didn’t even have the right to hear the case in the first place, as the plaintiff NGOs were simply trying to collect government payments stemming from contracts, a case that should have been heard by the U.S. Court of Federal Claims which exists for this very reason.\n\nTo fix this judicial hubris, Chairman Mast is introducing a bill that would take the power away from judges like Judge Ali to address monetary claims against the federal government concerning foreign assistance. This will allow the proper court to weigh each foreign aid contract objectively and determine if it should be paid out or not.\n\nThe bill would also give new presidential administrations 180 days to review and realign foreign aid funding with national security interests and priorities. If Americans wanted to continue Joe Biden’s disastrous foreign policy, they would have elected Kamala Harris last November. Americans overwhelmingly chose President Trump—and he has a mandate to lead.\n\nJudge Ali’s decision subverts the will of the American people. One individual judge was able to impose a $2 billion penalty on American taxpayers, single-handedly redefining America’s foreign policy priorities by deciding what can and cannot be funded via foreign aid.\n\nThat judge is not the commander-in-chief. He’s not the Secretary of State or the Secretary of Defense. He’s not a member of the National Security Council, and he’s certainly not a member of Congress with the power to authorize and fund foreign policy. Instead, he’s a Biden-appointed judge.\n\nOur system of checks and balances was not designed to have one rogue judge direct foreign policy for the entire free world. The Constitution “reflects Congress and the Executive’s ‘firmly established,’ shared responsibilities over foreign policy,” something that even Judge Ali concedes. Yet, his ruling is a slap in the face to the Constitutional order that he swore to uphold, protect, and defend.\n\nJudge Ali’s ruling also ignores the mountains of waste, fraud, and abuse that Congress has uncovered in our foreign assistance system. Everything from millions spent on sex change surgeries in Guatemala to condoms for the Taliban to financing for transgender operas and even programs helping Indonesian coffee companies become more gender and climate-friendly. No one can explain how these programs benefited America or made us the partner of choice for other countries. It probably would have been better if the government lit your tax dollars on fire than wasting it this way.\n\nYet, lower court judges think the crooked system that allowed these programs to happen in the first place should continue. Let’s work to make sure they don’t get their way and silence the voices of the more than 77 million Americans who voted for President Trump.\n\nJim Jordan represents Ohio’s 4th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives and is the current Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and an original founder of the House Freedom Caucus.

Some people around him were surprised that he had decided to go, but Gates wants to talk to whoever will listen. The dinner lasted three hours, and Trump seemed to enjoy himself, a person close to him said. They talked about polio -- an interest of both men -- and Gates left the meeting frankly impressed by the incoming president's interest in global health. Or so he told The Wall Street Journal. His comments, which he reiterated to some friends, did not age well. Less than a month after the Mar-a-Lago dinner, Trump was inaugurated and immediately went to work tearing down the global health infrastructure that undergirds the work of Gates' foundation. Next week, the Gates Foundation, marking its 25th anniversary, plans to celebrate its achievements, including helping to cut global child mortality in half since 2000. At what should be a moment of self-congratulation, however, the foundation, which gives away $9 billion each year, is facing grave threats to both its work and its future. Two days after Trump froze all U.S. foreign assistance, Elon Musk began to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development, which delivers aid around the world -- including vaccines, treatments and technologies created in labs bankrolled by the Gates Foundation. At the same time, the Trump administration has been on a campaign of retribution against institutions -- universities, big law firms -- that it perceives as too liberal. Philanthropies have been on edge, assuming they will be the next target of his ire. They are concerned that the president will use his law enforcement agencies to paralyze charitable institutions through investigations. And they fear a challenge to their tax-exempt status -- a threat that Trump made explicitly against Harvard University when it refused to bend to his demands. At the risk-averse Gates Foundation, officials have asked aides to put next to nothing in emails or other written materials, especially anything that Trump officials could take out of context. Some employees have locked down public social media accounts and shifted much of their work to Telegram or Signal, encrypted messaging apps. (Alex Reid, a spokesperson for the foundation, said employees had always been encouraged to be careful about communications.) The cautious partnership that Gates tried to initiate at Mar-a-Lago flamed out, but he has continued to make his case. He has met with the White House chief of staff, several Cabinet secretaries, the National Security Council and members of Congress. It's a very wide tent of champions that we are trying to enlist, Mark Suzman, the foundation's CEO, said in an interview. Gates hoped to find an ally in Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a vocal champion of efforts to fight malaria and child poverty in the past. But Rubio, who oversees foreign assistance, has declined to meet or speak with Gates since the election, the foundation said. This article is based on interviews with two dozen friends and advisers of Gates, current and former Gates Foundation employees and their associates, and foundation grant recipients, most of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a powerful foundation. The changes in Washington's approach have left Gates at sea, say current foundation employees and others who have talked with him. People who know him describe Gates as data-driven, sometimes to a fault, and they say he has struggled to align the apparent new rules of the game with the way he sees the world. In my experience, Bill is a rational thinker who wants to optimize for lives saved, so this chaotic world where people are acting off of spitefulness and vengeance is at odds with that, said Orin Levine, a former director of vaccine delivery at the foundation. To be shellshocked and in this completely foreign environment is a double whammy. Harsh blows and a muted response The foundation, which is based in Seattle, was started by Gates and his former wife, Melinda French Gates. They divorced in 2021, but ran the foundation together until 2024. The nation's biggest philanthropy, it has a $75 billion endowment. It employs more than 2,000 people and has offices around the developing world that can rival the power of the governments where they operate. As big as it is, it can't operate on its own. It doesn't deliver services directly, but funds the development of strategies and technologies and then works with governments, aid agencies and the private sector to disseminate them. The dismantling of USAID was the first gut punch, but not the last. Deep cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at the National Institutes of Health followed. Both were major funders of global health. Most of the architecture of U.S.-funded global health care has been either radically diminished or destroyed. Programs that have been Gates' priorities for decades were wiped out: vaccine research for malaria; deliveries of therapeutic food packets developed by the foundation to malnourished children; and African programs to deliver HIV prevention technologies that the foundation helped invent. One particularly harsh blow was the Trump administration's decision to end support for Gavi, an organization that helps the poorest countries buy childhood immunizations. Gates was Gavi's co-creator, and at times his foundation has been its largest funder. The news that the United States might withdraw from Gavi produced the foundation's most pointed response since the Trump administration began cutting foreign aid. On the social site X, Suzman said he was deeply disturbed by the news, if true. The wording of that post, which went on to suggest the dire consequences of cuts, was debated intensely beforehand by advisers, according to a person who was involved. The foundation has always been measured in its public statements, but it has labored to be as politically neutral as possible since Trump won the election, people close to it say. Some employees and allies have expressed frustration that Gates and the organization that leads much of the world's global health work have been muted in their response to what the employees see as a catastrophic level of cuts. Other than the post on X, Suzman has made a few careful statements related to Trump administration actions, such as the value of the World Health Organization and reproductive health care. Haters in the White House For people now in Trump's inner circle, the Gates Foundation has been a popular punching bag. When Vice President JD Vance was running for the Senate in 2021, he called the Gates Foundation, the Ford Foundation and the Harvard endowment cancers on American society because they received tax-exempt status to fund what he said was radical left-wing ideology. Stephen Miller, Trump's powerful policy adviser, has attacked the foundation's focus on racial equity and funding the most hateful, toxic and Marxist ideologies. And then there is Musk. The richest man in the world, he once signed the Giving Pledge, a Gates-operated philanthropic commitment. Now he taunts Gates on X, and has called his climate philanthropy hypocritical because he believes Gates has shorted the stock of Tesla, the electric automaker that Musk runs. As head of such a large and influential foundation, Gates is greeted around the world as a head of state might be, and has held himself out as assiduously nonpolitical. That changed in 2024 when he made a $50 million donation to support Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. After Trump was elected, Gates set out to make amends. In private conversations, according to a person who has heard him, Trump has name-checked Gates when he recalls the tech billionaires who used to despise him and now, as Trump says, want to be his friend. Still, the administration has monitored and been briefed on the Gates Foundation's ties to a liberal donor network called Arabella Advisors, a person close to the White House said. Suzman has told friends that he believes the Trump administration would target the foundation in various ways, primarily by stripping its tax-exempt status, two people who have spoken with him said. The foundation's work, Suzman said in an interview, is nonpartisan. What we work on -- saving kids from preventable deaths, trying to halt infectious diseases, providing opportunities for the poorest and most vulnerable -- is the absolute core of what charitable status exists to provide for, he said. Federal law bars the president from using the IRS to punish his enemies, but outside conservative groups are testing the waters. Edward Blum, who has made a career of challenging affirmative action, filed a complaint with the IRS against the Gates Foundation. He claimed that a fellowship program for students of color amounted to invidious racial discrimination that made the foundation ineligible for tax-exempt status. In fact, the foundation had changed the fellowship admissions policy months earlier, said Reid, the spokesperson. But the foundation did not make the change public until it was asked for comment on an opinion piece by Blum that The Wall Street Journal had published. The way it came out looked like caving, and was portrayed that way in right-wing media.Philanthropy leaders are also nervous about an executive order in January that directed the attorney general to identify institutions, including foundations with assets of $500 million or more that could be investigated for their diversity, equity and inclusion programs. The Gates Foundation, like other corporations and institutions, has taken steps to de-emphasize its DEI work. It laid off several members of its diversity team and retired the title of chief diversity, equity and inclusion officer. In a public appearance in February, Gates said DEI initiatives had sometimes gone too far. A failure of imagination The potential consequences of a significant disruption of the foundation's work are immense -- with the United States withdrawing from the World Health Organization, for example, the foundation is now the body's largest funder. Hundreds of scientists, aid groups and government ministers have turned to the foundation with panicked requests for help to preserve research and programs since the disruptions began in January. It is increasingly viewed as the last actor with both the resources and commitment to help. Suzman said the foundation's priority advocacy effort was preservation of U.S. funding for Gavi and for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, a major organization funded by governments, philanthropies and the private sector. He also said the foundation had committed an initial $30 million for countries in Africa and Asia for efforts to assess the holes left by the USAID cuts and to plan to restructure essential services. But Suzman acknowledged that the foundation would have to adapt, now that the world's largest aid agency had been gutted and other high-income nations were also reducing aid.In planning sessions around the election, foundation leaders tossed out various ways that Trump could change global aid. When the idea of a gutted USAID was suggested, it was dismissed as too sensational, two people with knowledge of those sessions said. Instead, the foundation's planning focused on a U.S. withdrawal from the WHO and a slashing of support for contraception and other reproductive health care. Suzman said the foundation had tried to anticipate what the new government might bring, but did not foresee the scale of the change. A senior strategist for the foundation confessed to a former colleague that they had a failure of imagination.At a TED conference this month in Vancouver, British Columbia, Gates' foundation passed out lapel buttons emblazoned with a buzzword of his philanthropy. But it is one that feels discordant with the landscape the foundation faces: Optimistic.","summary":"Bill Gates' efforts to collaborate with Donald Trump on global health faltered as the Trump administration dismantled key US aid programs.

He also falsely claimed that 60 Minutes, CBS, and parent company Paramount Global admitted to the “crime” of airing a different portion of the answer to the question.\n\n“In other words, 60 Minutes perpetrated a Giant FRAUD against the American People, the Federal Elections Commission, and the Federal Communications System,” the president wrote.\n\nCBS did not respond to an immediate request for comment.\n\nThe post came as lawyers for Trump and Paramount were set to begin mediation on Wednesday in Trump’s $20 billion defamation lawsuit, according to The New York Times, a process Paramount hopes will clear the way for its upcoming merger with David Ellison’s Skydance. Paramount’s board approved financial terms for a potential settlement during an April 18 meeting, according to the Times.\n\nTrump accused the show of “news distortion” in October after 60 Minutes previewed Harris’ interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker during Face the Nation with a clip of Harris’ winding answer on the U.S.’ relationship with Israel. But the next day, during a special Monday edition of 60 Minutes that Trump refused to participate in, a more streamlined version of Harris’ answer aired.\n\nTrump later filed a $10 billion federal lawsuit in Texas, amending it to $20 billion earlier this year.

Owens resigned last week after said it became apparent that, as he put it, “I would not be allowed to run the show as I have always run it, to make independent decisions based on what was right for ’60 Minutes,’ right for the audience.”\n\nThe Times also caught a stray attack after Trump complained that the paper’s inclusion of legal experts who called the lawsuit “baseless” made it “liable for tortious interference.” He suggested his lawyers are “intently studying” whether to sue the paper.\n\n“Nothing like this, the illegal creation of an answer for a Presidential Candidate, has ever been done before, they have to pay a price for it, and the Times should also be on the hook for their likely unlawful behavior,” he wrote.\n\nA Times spokesperson said Trump’s post “follows a long list of legal threats aimed at discouraging or penalizing independent reporting about the administration.”\n\n“The New York Times will not be deterred by the administration’s intimidation tactics,” the spokesperson wrote. “We will continue to pursue the facts without fear or favor and stand up for journalists’ First Amendment right to ask questions on behalf of the American people.”\n\nThe attack comes as Trump and his administration have waged and won wars against various media outlets, ranging from ABC’s $16 million settlement over a George Stephanopoulos interview to the FCC’s various investigations into Trump enemies such as ABC and NBC.","summary":"Scott Olsen/GettyPresident Donald Trump aired his furious grievances against 60 Minutes and CBS News on Wednesday, claiming he had a “WINNER” of a case in his $20 billion lawsuit over the show’s interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nIn a lengthy, rambling Truth Social screed, the president claimed once again that the show “cheated and defrauded the American People” after it aired a different part of Harris’ answer to a question over the war in Gaza. He also falsely claimed that 60 Minutes, CBS, and parent company Paramount Global admitted to the “crime” of airing a different portion of the answer to the question.\n\n“In other words, 60 Minutes perpetrated a Giant FRAUD against the American People, the Federal Elections Commission, and the Federal Communications System,” the president wrote.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-unleashes-deranged-attack-on-60-minutes-as-bosses-prepare-to-pay-him-off/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/XPOTO5D7VJCQ3MCGT7DQEKK7CI.jpg?smart=true&auth=db73ac1f6c6f5ec4060ac5f88341fab2eacd2acee246b7da039a4fa20d61fd79&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 16:13:36","author":"Corbin Bolies","authors":["Corbin Bolies"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.128},{"id":316504002,"title":"‘Because of my Instagram posts?’ AOC swerves questions on 2028 presidential run","text":"Democratic Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has brushed aside speculation that she could be preparing a presidential run in 2028.\n\nWith her party still reeling from former vice president Kamala Harris’s defeat last November, the New Yorker has emerged as a leading light of its progressive wing .

Some within the battleground state governor’s own party have taken issue with the recent appearances.\n\n“I think the fight-back faction of the Democratic Party is ascendant, and leaders who ignore that risk getting left behind,” Ezra Levin, co-executive director of the liberal organizing group Indivisible, told the Washington Post.\n\nSpeaking about the Oval Office visit, Adrian Hemond, a Democratic strategist in Michigan, told the outlet that while most Michiganders probably understand that working with the president is “part of the job,” the visit wasn’t great for political optics.\n\n“Nationally, you could view this as pretty damaging,” Hemond said. “Obviously the photos, the optics coming out of this meeting, weren’t great.”\n\nThe recent appearances didn’t seem to be entirely on her terms. Speaking at Michigan’s Selfridge Air National Guard Base on Tuesday, Trump hailed her as “very effective” before welcoming her onto the stage. He seemingly caught her off guard as she told the crowd that she “hadn’t planned to speak.” \n\n“On behalf of all the military men and women who serve our country and serve so honorably, on behalf of the state of Michigan, I am really damn happy we’re here to celebrate this recapitalization at Selfridge. It’s crucial for the Michigan economy. It’s crucial for the men and women here for our homeland security and our future. So thank you. I am so, so grateful that this announcement was made today, and I appreciate all the work. Thank you,\" Whitmer said.”\n\nHer comments came after she was pictured shaking hands with the president on the runway after he arrived in Michigan. \n\nAfter making her remarks on Tuesday alongside Trump, she told the Associated Press that she wasn’t thinking about politics: “My job is to do the right thing for the people of Michigan. I’m not thinking about anything beyond that, and I know it’s hard for people to get their head around.”\n\n“I had to be there because this was a big, important thing for the state of Michigan,” she said. “Now, he is going to go off to the rally and say a lot of things I disagree with, that I’ll fight against, and that’s fine, but, you know, my job is to do everything I can for the people of Michigan.”\n\nEarlier this month, when Whitmer had scheduled a meeting with Trump to discuss the future of the air base, according to the New York Times, the president’s aides brought her into the Oval Office, where she shielded herself from reporters' cameras - in a now infamous photo. \n\nHer office later said the governor was “surprised” that she was ushered into the Oval Office, where Trump signed executive orders, and that “her presence is not an endorsement of the actions taken or statements made at that event.”\n\nEven Trump clarified her White House visit to Tuesday’s crowd: \"That's the reason she came to see me, by the way: to save Selfridge.” He also announced new fighter jets at the base.\n\nMark Hackel, a Democratic and County Executive of Michigan’s Macomb County, took a different stance from others in his party. He praised her decision to meet with Trump at the White House. \n\n“Her going to White House … on the heels of an election where she was heavily involved campaigning for the Democratic nominee [against Trump], I think, says a lot about her understanding about her role is to be the governor of all, not just her party,” Hackel told the Post.\n\nMike Nellis, a Democratic strategist and former senior adviser to Harris, also defended the Democratic governor. “You won’t catch me complaining about Gretchen Whitmer saving tens of thousands of jobs or bringing in federal relief for people without power in Michigan. That’s the damn job.

The numbers show a deeply unsettled nation, with nearly two-thirds (66%) saying things in the country are going badly. At the same time, support for both Republican and Democratic leaders is slipping, as people call for more checks on Trump's power—and express little faith in the opposition party. Why are Americans so frustrated with both Republicans and Democrats? The public’s view of Congress is overwhelmingly negative. According to the poll: 56% believe Congress is not doing enough to limit Trump’s power. 53% say the Trump administration is failing to respect checks and balances. 50% think courts and judges aren’t doing enough either. These concerns are strongest among Democrats and independents, but there’s also a split among Republicans. While 75% of GOP-aligned adults think the administration is striking the right balance, 52% of them believe courts are overreaching in their attempts to limit Trump. Despite the criticism, Republicans are still more optimistic. 55% of Republican-aligned voters say they feel good about politics—up from 31% before Trump took office. But that enthusiasm is softening. The share of GOP voters who are enthusiastic about the rest of Trump’s second term dropped from 44% in February to 34% now. On the other hand, Democrats and left-leaning independents are growing more frustrated. 71% of them now say they feel afraid about what’s to come during Trump’s term—up from 63% just two months ago. Is anyone checking Trump’s power? Americans say “not enough” Any Americans feel that the government’s system of checks and balances is not working well under Trump’s second term. The poll shows growing concern that Trump is acting without enough pushback from Congress or the courts. The sentiment is even reflected in how Americans view the balance of power: 58% say that Republican control of the White House, Senate, and House is bad for the country. That’s up from 53% in January. Only 37% of Americans approve of how Republican leaders in Congress are handling their jobs. Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune both have negative favorability ratings (Johnson: 23% favorable, 33% unfavorable; Thune: 16% favorable, 24% unfavorable). But Democrats aren't seen as the solution either. In fact, approval ratings for Democratic leaders in Congress have hit a record low—just 27%, the lowest since CNN began polling in 2008. Nearly half (46%) of all adults disapprove of both parties' leaders. Are Democrats failing to lead the opposition? A key reason for the Democrats’ low approval is dissatisfaction within their own party. Here’s what the data says: Only 38% of Democratic-aligned adults approve of their party’s leadership. 61% disapprove of Democratic leaders in Congress. Chuck Schumer’s favorability has taken a big hit among young Democrats. Among those under 35, only 14% have a favorable view, while 24% view him unfavorably. In January, Schumer had a net positive rating among all age groups within the party. Now, his numbers have declined across the board, especially after his March decision not to oppose a GOP-backed spending bill. Hakeem Jeffries, House Minority Leader, has also seen a dip. His net favorability among Democrats and left-leaning independents dropped from +37 points to +31, with more people viewing him unfavorably. These falling numbers are stirring anger among Democrats. 70% of Democratic-aligned adults say they’re angry about the state of politics, a sharp rise from 46% in January. Overall, 45% of Americans say they’re angry—up from 39% earlier this year. Do Americans think Harris would have done better than Trump? When asked to compare Trump to Kamala Harris, who narrowly lost the 2024 election, Americans are split: 42% say Trump is doing a better job than Harris would have. 41% say Harris would’ve done better. 16% say there wouldn’t be much difference. Even voters who supported Harris in 2024 are expressing regret, not necessarily because of her performance, but because they feel Democrats haven’t stood up strongly enough against Trump since his return to office. One respondent, Gregory Victorianne, a 65-year-old Democrat from Los Angeles, said: What does this mean for the future of American politics? Americans are clearly unhappy with the current state of politics. They want stronger checks on Trump’s power, but they’re also disillusioned with the Democratic Party’s leadership. Frustration cuts across party lines: 63% of Americans feel frustrated with politics (same as in January). 60% say they’re disappointed (down 10 points). 82% of Democrats and leaners say they’re frustrated, while 45% of Republican-aligned voters say the same. As the poll shows, this frustration is deeper than partisanship—it’s about performance. With trust slipping in both parties, Americans are demanding accountability, transparency, and bold leadership—especially from those claiming to resist Trump’s agenda.FAQs: Q1: Why are Americans frustrated with Trump’s second term? Because many believe checks on Trump’s power are too weak and the country is heading in the wrong direction. Q2: Why are Democrats losing support despite Trump’s low approval? Voters feel Democratic leaders aren’t doing enough to oppose Trump and demand more visible action.","summary":"He Story: Americans frustrated with Trump and disappointed in Democrats Americans are growing frustrated with politics under Donald Trump’s second term, according to a new CNN poll.

Surprisingly, even Democrats aren’t gaining support—their approval is at a record low, with rising anger among their own voters.

An earlier version of this story had the wrong time period for Musk and DOGE working for Trump.)\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s first 100 days in office have spooked financial markets, tested legal bounds and turned the federal government upside-down, denting his poll numbers in the process.\n\nOn April 29 during a rally in Michigan, Trump claimed it’s all going according to plan.\n\n“We’ve accomplished more in three months than most administrations accomplished in four years or eight years,\" the president declared.\n\nTrump’s second administration has opened with a furious blitz of conservative policy focused around deportations, deep cuts to federal agencies and tariffs. Polls show most Americans think he has gone too far on all of those issues.\n\nA New York Times/Sienna College survey released April 25 found majorities of those surveyed disapprove of his handling of the economy, immigration, the federal bureaucracy and overall job performance.\n\nFaced with a growing backlash, Trump tried to sell his agenda to the American people at the Warren rally. Trump defended his efforts on tariffs, immigration and his Department of Government Efficiency and promised much more to come.\n\n\"We’re just getting started,\" he said, standing in front of supporters waving \"MAGA\" and \"USA\" signs.\n\nHere are four takeaways from Trump’s Michigan rally.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for you: Sign up for USA TODAY's On Politics newsletter.\n\n'A little time before we slaughter them' on tariffs\n\nTrump’s handling of the economy has been especially concerning for many Americans.\n\nKey stock market indexes are down significantly since Trump first took office and economic forecasters say the likelihood of a recession has increased amid looming trade wars sparked by the president’s tariffs.\n\nThe New York Times/Sienna College survey found that 55% of respondents disapprove of Trump’s handling of the economy. An ABC News/Washington Post/Ipsos poll released April 27 found that 72% of those surveyed say Trump's policies are likely to cause a recession.\n\nMichigan's auto industry has been hit hard by globalization, though, and Trump said his policies will help restore manufacturing in the state, pointing to tariffs on foreign automobiles.\n\n“This is going to create more jobs in this state and this country,\" he said.\n\nTrump has walked back some of his tariffs amid concerns about their economic impact. He eased the auto levies on the same day of the rally, pitching the move as giving car companies \"a little bit of flexibility.\"\n\n“We give them a little time before we slaughter them if they don’t do this,” he said.\n\nNot 'under the thumb of Elon'\n\nThe dramatic overhaul of federal agencies pushed by Elon Musk and DOGE dominated the early days of Trump's second term.\n\nDOGE has fired tens of thousands of federal workers and dismantled whole agencies in a quest to reduce spending and improve efficiency. Democrats have slammed Musk's approach as haphazard and chaotic. Many Americans seem to agree, with 52% saying in the New York Times/Sienna College poll that they disapprove of how Trump is handling the federal government.\n\nThe huge leeway Trump has given Musk with DOGE has prompted criticism from Democrats that Musk is running the government.\n\n\"You know they all say, oh, well Trump is under the thumb of Elon,\" Trump told the crowd.\n\nTrump noted he repealed former President Joe Biden's electric vehicle push despite Musk running electric car company Tesla. He praised Musk's work at DOGE, though.\n\n\"On day one I created that ... very successful Department of Government Efficiency headed by Elon. That was a big thing doing that,\" he said, touting DOGE moves such as dismantling the U.S. Agency for International Development.\n\nTrump touts Alien Enemies Act\n\nImmigration has long been a focus for Trump and an issue he points to as pivotal to his political success.\n\nHe promised mass deportations during the campaign and is following through. But his deportation tactics have sparked outrage.\n\nTrump declared members of crime gangs Tren de Aragua and MS-13 as foreign terrorist organizations and invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to deport them more swiftly. But courts all the way up to the Supreme Court have temporarily paused the removals while hearing arguments about whether the migrants deserve hearings to voice their side of the story and to deny their membership in the gangs.\n\nTrump touted the lengths his administration has gone to in pushing deportations, including using the Alien Enemies Act against alleged foreign gang members.\n\n\"They've been designated the highest level of terrorists, and that lets us do a lot of things that you wouldn't be able to do,\" he said.\n\n\"We've invoked the Alien Enemies Act to expel every foreign terrorist from our soil as quickly as possible,\" he added.\n\nIllegal crossings dropped 95% at the Southwest border in March, to fewer than 7,200 migrant encounters from more than 137,000 encounters the same month a year ago, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection data.\n\n'Trump 2028 anybody?'\n\nTrump is prohibited by the Constitution from seeking a third term. But he's openly toyed with the idea.\n\nThe president said in an NBC interview that he's \"not joking\" about the possibility of staying in office.\n\n\"A lot of people want me to do it,\" Trump said. \"But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it’s very early in the administration.\"\n\nAt the Michigan rally Trump aide Margo Martin raised the prospect of a third term when the president called her onto the stage.\n\n\"Trump 2028 anybody?\" Martin said.\n\nTrump seemed to relish being back among a rally crowd, saying \"I miss the campaign.\" He returned to many of his favorite campaign lines, jabbing at Biden and his 2024 Democratic opponent Kamala Harris.\n\nContributing: Bart Jansen","summary":"Trump defends first 100-days agenda amid sliding polls: 4 takeaways from Michigan rally  USA Today","url":"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/04/29/trump-rally-michigan-100-days-immigration-tariffs-doge/83345317007/","image":"https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/04/29/USAT/83354710007-trump-rally-pic.jpg?crop=8255,4645,x0,y429&width=1600&height=800&format=pjpg&auto=webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-04-30 15:22:17","author":"Zac Anderson","authors":["Zac Anderson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":316572174,"title":"After a year of turmoil, The Washington Post is taking note of its journalism again","text":"After a brutal year of headlines about The Washington Post, Executive Editor Matt Murray sounded almost relieved to be talking about journalism.\n\nIn an interview, he was touting “100 scoops in 100 days” about the Post's coverage of the Trump administration's first weeks. What sounds like a publicist's confection has truth behind it, with reporters putting their heads down and working, notably on stories involving the federal workforce and spending cuts.\n\nMost stories about the Post in the past few months have been negative, including publisher Will Lewis' botched reorganization that led to former Executive Editor Sally Buzbee's resignation last June, owner Jeff Bezos asserting himself over the opinion section and defections among journalists worried about the outlet's direction.\n\n“Great stories and great scoops are always good to remind people — both externally and internally — that it's all about the journalism at the end of the day,” Murray said.\n\nThe grunt work of reporting on the federal workforce\n\nDan Diamond, Hannah Natanson, Carolyn Y. Johnson and Lena H. Sun are among the reporters who have dug into specifics about Department of Government Efficiency-inspired cuts and what they've meant for medical research and services for Social Security recipients. Natanson, Rachel Siegel and Laura Meckler have explored the use of government data to go after undocumented immigrants.\n\nAdam Taylor and John Hudson have dug into proposed cuts at the State Department. Maria Sacchetti and Artur Galocha showed how half of the people the White House reported as immigration enforcement arrests were already behind bars. Jacob Bogage wrote about a Trump appointee asking the IRS to review an audit of conservative personality Mike Lindell.\n\nIt's grunt work, developing sources and stories that build upon other stories, many involving federal workers — the industry that the city is built upon.\n\n“The Post has an historic obligation — it's right in our name, Washington — to write aggressively, truthfully, thoughtfully about the government and what's happening there,” Murray said. “Obviously the Trump administration, whatever one thinks of them, has the most aggressive change program that we've seen in many administrations.”\n\nThe work breaking stories has been noticeable, said Margaret Sullivan, a former media columnist at the Post who still writes, teaches at Columbia University and runs the Craig Newmark Center for Journalism Ethics and Security there.\n\n“I've been happy to see that,” she said. “The place has been through such a difficult time and it's not due to the journalists there. It's because of the ownership and management.”\n\nThe Post hasn't yet earned its own Truth Social post about its reporting since President Donald Trump's return — the ultimate sign it has gotten under the Republican president's skin — but the White House labeled one of its stories about health funding “fake news.” Tulsi Gabbard, national intelligence director, cited a Post story about Israel and Iran among her reasons to seek out internal leakers.\n\nThe work has also calmed fears about whether owner Bezos' newfound friendliness with Trump would impact news coverage. Last fall, Bezos ordered a planned endorsement of Trump's Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris, spiked, triggering an exodus of angry subscribers. He was a prominently visible guest at Trump's second inauguration and soon after said the Post's opinion pages should focus primarily on personal liberties and the free market.\n\nThat change in direction led to the resignations of editorial page editor David Shipley and two long-time Post columnists, Ruth Marcus and Eugene Robinson.\n\nBezos' actions with the opinion section have hurt the Post's reputation when the country really needs it, and when its news coverage has been excellent, said Robert McCartney, a retired Post columnist. “Their DOGE coverage has been really good, as good as anybody's,” he said. “They have broken a lot of news. They have done a lot of important accountability reporting.”\n\nJournalists are taking advantage of new opportunities\n\nBetween the turmoil and a sea of red ink resulting in layoffs, the Post suffered a significant talent defection at the end of last year. Journalists like Matea Gold, the respected managing editor, and journalists Josh Dawsey, Ashley Parker, Philip Rucker and Michael Scherer took new jobs. That exposed some thin skin; Murray, then only interim editor, briefly banned goodbye emails believing they were bad for morale, before the decision was reversed, the Guardian reported. The paper has banned its media writers from reporting stories about the newspaper.\n\n“The reporters are doing good work, by and large,” said Richard Prince, a reporter and editor who spent 20 years at the Post in two stints. “It's a shame there is all this turmoil that is coming from the top. It seems like they lost more talent than they gained.”\n\nAt a time there are more journalists than jobs, the Post is still a desired destination. “Many other people are stepping up and have had new opportunities and are showing their chops,” said Murray, who had the “interim” removed from his title with no fanfare earlier this year.\n\nThe Post is still in transition; Murray appointed some key deputies last week. It is still sorting out coverage areas that need more attention and those that don't. He promised more resources to follow technology, artificial intelligence and the markets.\n\nThe Post reportedly lost some 325,000 subscribers after the Harris non-endorsement and editorial policy change; the newspaper won't say whether it has recovered that number since through new or returned subscribers. The newspaper is more aggressively seeking new readers and says 100,000 more new subscribers signed up this year than did over the same period in 2024.\n\nIt's spring; consider them all shoots popping up from the ground after a damaging winter.\n\n“I would not quit the Post,” Sullivan said. “If I were a regular reader, I would still find it very interesting and necessary.”","summary":"After a brutal year of headlines about The Washington Post, Executive Editor Matt Murray sounded almost relieved to be talking about journalism.\n\nIn an interview, he was touting &ldquo;100 scoops in 100 days&rdquo; about the Post's coverage of the Trump administration's first weeks.

Anthony Bernal, a senior adviser to former First Lady Jill Biden, confirmed he, too, had been dismissed.Since taking office in January, Trump has moved to fire many Biden appointees across government - including ostensibly apolitical roles.

Now Paramount executives are reportedly nearing a deal with Trump to settle the claims, according to Mark Steffen at Trending Politics.\n\nSteffen reported: “The offer, set to be discussed Wednesday in the first mediation between both camps, is a tacit acknowledgement of how desperate the entertainment company’s upper echelon has become to end Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit.\n\n“During an April 18th meeting, Paramount allegedly outlined financial parameters for a potential settlement with the president, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions. The exact dollar amount is unclear, but reaching a consensus would pave the way for both sides to seek dismissal of the suit.”\n\nTrump said Wednesday on Truth Social: “The case we have against 60 Minutes, CBS, and Paramount is a true WINNER.”\n\n“They cheated and defrauded the American People at levels never seen before in the Political Arena. Kamala Harris, during Early Voting and, immediately before Election Day, was asked a question, and gave an answer, that was so bad and incompetent that it would have cost her many of the Votes that she ended up getting.\n\n“It was a disastrous answer! 60 Minutes and its corporate parents, in order that this not have a negative impact on her, removed and deleted Kamala’s entire answer, every word of it, and replaced it with a response that she gave later on to an entirely different question.\n\nRemember Kamala’s word salad answer about Israel on 60 Minutes? It’s gone.\nThis is what many Americans will now see. pic.twitter.com/H4w7btDv6x\n— MAZE (@mazemoore) October 8, 2024\n\n“The new answer was not good, but it didn’t show Gross Incompetence like the one that was removed by 60 Minutes. In other words, 60 Minutes perpetrated a Giant FRAUD against the American People, the Federal Elections Commission, and the Federal Communications System.”\n\nTrump continued: “Despite all of the above, and Paramount’s/CBS’/60 Minutes’ admittance to this crime and, with other similar corrupt removals of answers to questions, the Failing New York Times, which is Fake News both in writing and polling, claims that ‘people’ said that the case is baseless.\n\n“They don’t mean that, they just have a non curable case of TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME, possibly to the point where the Times’ interjection makes them liable for tortious interference, including in Elections, which we are intently studying. The bottom line is that what 60 Minutes and its corporate owners have committed is one of the most egregious illegalities in Broadcast History.\n\n“Nothing like this, the illegal creation of an answer for a Presidential Candidate, has ever been done before, they have to pay a price for it, and the Times should also be on the hook for their likely unlawful behavior. It is vital to hold these Liars and Fraudsters accountable!”\n\nIs the news we hear every day actually broadcasting messages from God? The answer is an absolute yes! Find out how!\n\nAs WorldNetDaily reported in October, CBS was named in a federal complaint for its decision to make Harris look coherent, as it was accused of “significant and intentional news distortion.”\n\nCBS News released a statement at the time, indicating: “Former President Donald Trump is accusing ’60 Minutes’ of deceitful editing of our Oct. 7 interview with Vice President Kamala Harris. That is false.”\n\n“’60 Minutes’ gave an excerpt of our interview to ‘Face the Nation’ that used a longer section of her answer than that on 60 Minutes. Same question. Same answer. But a different portion of the response. When we edit any interview, whether a politician, an athlete, or movie star, we strive to be clear, accurate and on point. The portion of her answer on ’60 Minutes’ was more succinct, which allows time for other subjects in a wide ranging 21-minute-long segment.”\n\nHoward Kurtz, the former Washington Post media writer who left CNN to join Fox News in 2013, blasted “60 Minutes” as “blatantly unethical” for its “pathetic response.”\n\n“This is a pathetic response by ’60 Minutes’ after a week of silence,” Kurtz told Martha MacCallum of Fox News.\n\n‘Pathetic’: #Media expert shreds #60Minutes response about deceitful editing of #KamalaHarris interview\n‘It’s blatantly unethical, and if someone on my staff did that, they’d be looking for a new job’#Trump #Election2024 #MediaBuzz @HowardKurtz @marthamaccallum @MediaBuzzFNC pic.twitter.com/gs2PTnJmyX\n— WorldNetDaily (@worldnetdaily) October 21, 2024\n\n“It basically says, ‘Yeah, we did it.

You can’t have a different part of an answer to the same question.”\n\n“It’s blatantly unethical, and if someone on my staff did that, they’d be looking for a new job,” he continued.\n\nTrump himself previously hammered CBS for its deceptive editing, calling it “the single greatest scandal, in my opinion, in broadcast history.”\n\n#Trump: ’60 Minutes and #CBS should lose their license’ for ‘single greatest scandal in broadcast history’ #media #Election2024 @mariabartiromo pic.twitter.com/uumW8UtulO\n— WorldNetDaily (@worldnetdaily) October 13, 2024\n\n“’60 Minutes’ and CBS interviewed Kamala, and she’s incompetent.
