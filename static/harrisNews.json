But as demand for print journalism has waned, instead favoring digital media, the publication's visual tradition has entered a new era.\n\n Coinciding with the release of the new Netflix documentary The New Yorker at 100, the magazine's editor-in-chief David Remnick spoke with PEOPLE about how the publication maintains some of its traditions as media consumption patterns evolve. The New Yorker, the lauded magazine known for its witty comics, rigorous reporting and pensive pieces from celebrated writers, marked its centenary earlier this year in February.\n\n Remnick tells PEOPLE that The New Yorker covers mean something different as mass publication shifts to a digital space. The cover illustration is meant to capture a specific moment, he says — something social media posts can also do, and faster.\n\n \"I think the challenge is that we're inundated with images every day. We're all consuming the millions of photographs we take on our phones,\" Remnick says. \"And yet, you still see covers having resonance online,\"\n\n The New Yorker at 100, directed by Marshall Curry and with Judd Apatow as an executive producer, takes a close look at the publication's history of innovative covers. Unlike most other magazines, The New Yorker has only ever run illustrated covers, all of which determine the \"personality of the issue,\" art editor Françoise Mouly says in the documentary.\n\n \"It's not something that you can just slap on at the last minute,\" Mouly explains. \"A cover needs to speak to the moment but also be a timeless piece of art that should be able to be framed and put on a wall.\"\n\n This has been a guiding ethic over the last century. The publication's covers have captured history and the public mood that defines it — like the famous September 2001 issue's cover, which simply featured the black outline of the Twin Towers against a dark sky.\n\n The November 2024 cover was decided on election night based on the winner, according to the documentary. That month's cover featured the silhouette of Donald Trump, looming across much of the publication's title — \"an incredibly cheerful sketch,\" Remnick jokes in the documentary. An alternative cover, also meant for a Trump win, was an illustration of an orange prescription bottle that read \"take one tablet by mouth once a day for four years.\"\n\n What also never made it to newsstands was the cover illustration of Kamala Harris, whose blue suit was etched with the faces of Black trailblazers that came before her, like Barack Obama and Fredrick Douglass.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n It's a lot of work put into an image that still must compete with other media online, Remnick admits. But to him and The New Yorker staff, it remains a worthwhile pursuit.\n\n \"To come up with an image that encapsulates a moment, or even a sense of beauty about it, this wonderful city that we live in, or make a political piece of commentary in just one image — it has only gotten harder to break through,\" Remnick tells PEOPLE. \"But when you do it, it does something wonderful.\"\n\n The New Yorker at 100 is now available to stream on Netflix.","summary":"Editor-in-chief David Remnick tells PEOPLE that the intricate covers compete with millions of pieces of media consumed online every day","url":"https://people.com/the-new-yorker-illustrated-covers-decline-print-journalism-exclusive-11863974","image":"https://people.com/thmb/szh1RR3wARqSGTd5zqTs7wwf6gw=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(745x160:747x162)/The-New-Yorker-at-100-Francoise-Mouly-David-Remnick-120825-df391cc69c444101aef0809d5e24f371.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-09 00:00:00","author":"Rachel Raposas","authors":["Rachel Raposas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.382},{"id":386304408,"title":"Democrat Responds To Michelle Obama’s Reality Check About A Woman In The White House","text":"Rep.

They’re drawn to something else — something different — because what’s here now DOES NOT WORK FOR THEM! What they’ve seen isn’t free enterprise. It’s a crony system where power protects power.” \n\nSo it’s up to Gen X to “persuade them of a better economy, built on widely-dispersed prosperity that prioritizes American workers and small businesses.”\n\nEye on China: Warn Xi on Martyring Jimmy Lai\n\nAlthough “Jimmy Lai will spend his 78th birthday in a prison cell in Hong Kong,” the Wall Street Journal editorial board sees “reason to hope that the newspaper-owner-turned-political prisoner could be released.” \n\nEyeing his April meeting with China’s Xi Jinping, President Trump can argue that Hong Kong activists’ “imprisonment is a public-relations disaster” and if he “dies in jail, it will be a permanent stain” on Beijing; so what if reports of “Lai’s medical care and overall incarceration” annoy Hong Kong authorities.\n\n“We hope Mr. Trump reminds Mr. Xi that the only way he can take Mr. Lai off the table and prevent the press from publicly asking embarrassing questions is to release him well before President Trump arrives in Beijing.”\n\nForeign desk: Musk’s Right — EU Is a ‘Menace’\n\n“Europhiles” are “coming for Elon Musk,” snarks Spiked’s Brendan O’Neill. \n\nAfter the billionaire called for the EU to be abolished, “EU-loving centrists of Renew Europe” accused him of doing Vladimir Putin’s bidding. \n\nYet “Musk is right about the EU,” and “to say it is a menace to the ‘sovereignty’ of European nations.” \n\nCritics have long noted that its “entire purpose” is “to hoover up the sovereign rights of member states. And to fashion a Brussels superstate whose laws and courts would enjoy primacy over those of silly little nations.” \n\nAnd it ensures “compliance” by threatening, bullying and fining defiant nations. As Musk argues, “the dismantling of the EU is the first step to European governments ‘better representing their people.’ ”\n\nIconoclast: The ABA Has No Clothes\n\nAfter decades of decline, the American Bar Association’s membership now accounts for just 17% of the nation’s lawyers, notes Jonathan Turley at The Hill. Why? \n\n“For decades, the ABA has moved steadily to the left,” needlessly taking stands “on an array of divisive issues on the side of liberal interpretations and agendas.” \n\nSo now “the question is why states and universities should continue to treat the ABA as if it represented a significant percentage of lawyers in the US, let alone the values of a majority of such lawyers,” when it’s become just another “leftist echo chamber.”\n\n— Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"Even deep partisanship in Washington, DC, can’t account for “the rancor to which the National Guard and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement have been subject along the Potomac.”","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/08/opinion/dc-elites-loathe-their-protectors-gen-zs-capitalism-complaints-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/newspress-collage-jhvcw9cfw-1765229150589.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1765215671&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 22:42:29","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":386289342,"title":"Could the latest liberal darling cost Democrats their best chance at flipping Texas Senate seat?","text":"On Monday, Rep. Jasmine Crockett shook up Texas politics when she filed to run for the Democratic nomination for one of the two Lone Star State seats in the U.S. Senate.\n\nAlmost immediately, everyone in Washington could hear Texas Republicans’ boot-heels clicking. \n\nJennifer DeCasper, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, tweeted that Crockett was the NRSC’s “#1 recruit.” Indeed, the committee had put out a poll in July showing her leading Democrat Colin Allred, who announced Monday he would drop out of the race to run instead for his old House seat. \n\nCrockett has become a darling of the “No Kings” protest-marching liberals who enjoy her for her barbs against Republicans such as calling Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene a “bleach blonde bad-built butch body” and Rep. Nancy Mace “child” after Mace made transphobic remarks. \n\nBut Crockett has also gotten herself in trouble in recent months for the same sharp tongue that allows her to raise gobs of cash. \n\nEarlier this year, she came under fire for calling Texas Gov. Greg Abbott – who has a disability and uses a wheelchair – ”Governor Hot Wheels.” She also recently spoke on the House floor and said that Environmental Protection Agency Director Lee Zeldin received money from Jeffrey Epstein when Zeldin served in Congress from New York, but it was a person not related to the late convicted sex offender. \n\nNow Crockett is set for a collision course with state legislator James Talarico. But some Democrats fear that Crockett might cost them their best chance at causing a 50-50 Senate in 2026.\n\n“I think Jasmine Crockett is a fire brand, somebody who understands that to reach people in the modern age,” Micah Erfan, a former executive committee member of the Texas Democratic Party, told The Independent. \n\nHe said that any Democrat would need to win over Republicans and independents who otherwise would not vote for a Democrat. Instead, Crockett seems focused on going all-in on her anti-Trump messaging. Her announcement video features soundbytes of Trump criticizing her, a bold move for a Democrat in a state where Trump won by double digits. \n\n“ The Electoral math that we have is one in which we have to win over, as I said, a bunch of voters that are currently voting for Republicans or have voted for Republicans in the past,” Erfan said. “And that means that you're going to have to win over these Latinos. That means you're going to have to win over maybe some Christians, right? Some moderates and independents.” \n\nSpeaking of Christ, make no mistake: Democrats would need an act of God to flip Texas’ Senate seat under normal circumstances. They have not won a statewide race there since 1994 and have not won a Senate race since 1988. \n\nEvery once in a while, Democrats see a glimmer of hope. In 2008, Barack Obama flipped Harris County, which made Democrats think they could one day compete in the state. That turned out to be fool’s gold and in 2014, Democrats got clobbered. \n\nIn 2016, Hillary Clinton got within 10 points of Texas and won three congressional districts. That opened the door for Beto O’Rourke to get within striking distance against Ted Cruz, which carried Allred and Lizze Fletcher to flip two House seats in 2018. In 2020, Democrats got within 5.5 points of winning Texas, but they collapsed in the Rio Grande Valley, serving as a precursor to Trump flipping the predominantly Hispanic region in 2024. \n\n“I'd say that the way to victory in Texas is by getting Assad margins with Hispanics,” Erfan said. “I think the idea right now is that ice and the Trump administration's policies regarding deportations is going to hand us the Hispanic vote. I think it will, to a certain extent, but we need not just 75% of the vote. We need 89% of the vote to overcome the margins that Republicans are getting with white Texans.”\n\nThat being said, Democrats don’t have many options to take back the Senate. Republicans have 53 Senate seats, meaning Democrats need to flip three to even tie and force JD Vance to make a bunch of votes the way Kamala Harris did. \n\nOnly one Republican hails from a state that voted for Harris: Sen. Susan Collins and a contentious primary between Gov. Janet Mills and progressive favorite Graham Platner makes it far from a guaranteed flip. Their next best chance to flip is North Carolina, where former Democratic governor Roy Cooper, who won the state twice in a year Trump won it, is running for retiring Sen. Thom Tillis’s seat. \n\nStill, Democrats have a golden opportunity given that Republicans have a slugfest of a primary. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) is running for re-election against the state’s attorney general Ken Paxton, whom the Republican state legislature impeached before the state senate acquitted him. His wife Angela, a state senator, announced she would divorce Paxton “on biblical grounds,” given Paxton’s multiple affairs. \n\nMatt Angle, the founder of the liberal Lone Star Policy Project, told The Independent that the race will be a dogfight. \n\n“Ken Paxton is going to win that primary, they're going to nominate a criminal,” Angle said. “John Cornyn is a dead Senator walking his brand of Republican in Texas has been extinct for a while here, yeah, and his, his kind of faking being MAGA.” \n\nIt will still be a lift for them. Angle said the immortal question for Democrats is whether to persuade people or to build a coalition. \n\n“And so the question is that challenge for Jasmine or for James Talarico, whoever is the nominee, because remember, Jasmine's not the nominee, and James Talarico is a very strong candidate,” he said. “They got to not only expand the base, but also build that coalition you need in Texas.”\n\nUltimately, if the primary turns out to be a race between Crockett and Paxton, a real possibility, the race might come down to whom voters dislike less. Someone like Paxton might have enough baggage to turn away certain voters. But even in a swing year, a firebrand like Crockett might compel voters who otherwise might consider voting for a Democrat to stay away.","summary":"Jasmine Crockett’s decision to run for Senate has some sweating in the Lone Star state, Eric Garcia writes.

Communities are looking for people with courage, people with a backbone, who are willing to stand up.”\n\nDespite Dearborn having a Democratic mayor, let’s take a moment to revisit the Michigan city’s own choices.\n\nIn 2020, the U.S.’s first Arab-majority city backed Joe Biden with 69% of the vote. Four years later, only 36% of the city’s voters supported Kamala Harris. Forty-two percent voted for Donald Trump. Another 18%went with Jill Stein. Although nationally only 10% of Muslims who voted for Biden in 2020 voted for Trump in 2024.\n\nAnd the city didn’t just help deliver Trump’s victory, they celebrated it. Politico captured it with a headline that needed no embellishment: “Dearborn’s Arab Americans feel vindicated by Harris’ loss.”\n\nThey weren’t just vindicated. “They feel like they’ve been redeemed,” Dearborn City Council President Michael Sareini told Politico. “They wanted to send a message and they did.” Message delivered.\n\nA local activist even described the results as “we became much more politically mature.” But “maturity” apparently meant voting for the candidate who wants to expel Gazans and stamp his own ego into the rubble with golden monuments.\n\nOsama Siblani, publisher of The Arab American News, put it plainly. \n\n“They didn’t vote for Trump because they believe Trump is the best candidate,” he said. “No, they voted for Trump because they want to punish the Democrats and Harris.”\n\nAnd punish them they did.\n\nSo why are the same people now demanding that Democrats rescue them from the very consequences of the outcome they helped create? Why are they pleading for protection from the man they empowered?\n\nIt’s not just contradictory. It undermines their own stated cause. They aren’t directing their protest energy at President Donald Trump or Vice President JD Vance—the two men who have backed ethnic cleansing in Gaza. They’re not mobilizing against the actual federal power targeting immigrant and Muslim communities. Instead, they are protesting Democrats who currently have no power to stop any of it.\n\nThat isn’t a strategy. It’s a tantrum on top of the last tantrum.\n\nCivil rights activists didn’t march only in cities that had already integrated. Pro-immigration groups don’t target sanctuary-city mayors. Pro-choice activists don’t limit their rallies to states protecting abortion rights. Successful movements confront the source of the harm, not the nearest soft target.\n\nIf “political maturity” is truly the goal, then it starts with choosing effective targets and owning the consequences of political decisions. Don’t hand the keys to a man promising to do exactly what he did the first time around, except worse. And don’t go running to the very people you worked to defeat, demanding they clean up the mess.\n\nThat’s not courage. That’s not conviction. It’s just sad.","summary":"“The targeting of immigrants, the targeting of Muslim communities—we’ve seen this rhetoric climb over the past several months and I anticipate it getting worse,” Dearborn Mayor Abdullah Hammoud, who is a Democrat, told the Washington Post. “The fact that we do not have a strong counterresponse from [Democratic] elected officials at all levels of government is the most frightening, especially when the vitriol is coming from the highest office in the world.

Adam Schiff, who in 2019 rushed to impeach Trump over the Ukraine matter in hopes that it would make it impossible for Trump to win reelection in 2020. Today, Schiff looks back at Trump’s four years out of office and wonders what might have been had Democrats hit Trump earlier.\n\n“Do you feel that [then-Attorney General] Merrick Garland moved too slowly?” New Yorker editor David Remnick asked Schiff on the New Yorker Radio Hour last week. “I absolutely do, yeah,” said Schiff. “Why did Garland move so slowly?” asked Remnick. “What about his character or tactics or strategy led him to behave that way?”\n\n“The Justice Department in the first Trump [administration] was abused and made partisan,” Schiff said, “and [Garland] wished to restore the reputation of the department for strict non-partisanship. And that made him very reluctant to pursue an investigation of the president — too reluctant.”\n\n“Ultimately, that gave the Supreme Court the time it needed to drag things out further and make the case against Trump go away completely, when it could have been brought to fruition,” Schiff concluded. “And we might be in a very different place today.”\n\nThat’s the story: If only Garland had gone after Trump earlier, the Supreme Court wouldn’t have had time to rule on the question of immunity, and there would be no President Trump today. A simple solution.\n\nWhat to say? First, without any doubt, the prosecutions of Trump increased Republican support for the former president. Remember that Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL), running against Trump in the 2024 GOP primaries, said the indictments “sucked all of the oxygen” out of the Republican race. Democratic lawfare made Trump more popular and absolutely unbeatable in a GOP contest.\n\nDAILY MEMO: WILL TRUMP’S REVENGE CAMPAIGN BACKFIRE?\n\nAs far as the general election is concerned, besides boosting Republican intensity, it’s hard to say that the great Democratic lawfare project had any effect on 2024 voting. There were critical issues, such as inflation, immigration, and crime, and voters looked at their choices — first Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden, and then Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris — and decided that Trump was the better candidate. Democrats were not helped by the fact that Biden was senile, and no Democrat would admit what millions of voters could see with their own eyes.\n\nBut still, Adam Schiff looks back and sees a glorious outcome in which Garland and the Biden Justice Department supercharged a speedy Trump investigation, pushed the Supreme Court to the side, and convicted and imprisoned Trump before Election Day. With the Republican favorite in jail, Democrats kept control of the White House, and GOP voters accepted it with resignation because, after all, no man is above the law.

Let’s Talk About It","text":"Source: KOCO video screenshot / KOCO screenshot Student protests at the University of Oklahoma are still in full swing after the college placed a psychology instructor on administrative leave after they were accused by junior Samantha Fulnecky of religious discrimination, when all that really happened was a student got a failing grade for a paper that absolutely deserved a failing grade. Mostly, the internet has not been on Fulnecky’s side, with people rightfully pointing out that she didn’t complete the assignment — in which she was given a scholarly article about “gender typicality, peer relations, and mental health,” and directed to write a “thoughtful discussion of some aspect of the article” — because she didn’t follow the rubric, make the word count, cite any sources, including specific biblical text, or even discuss the subject she was assigned to discuss. Instead, Fulnecky opted to write about how her God tells her trans people — who were, again, not the subject of the original article — are “demonic.” What’s worse, Fulnecky’s writing style likely wouldn’t have passed muster in a middle school English class. Still, white conservatives, including Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt, other conservative politicians from Oklahoma, right-wing pundits and podcasters, and, of course, the fine folks at Turning Point USA, have gone to bat for Fulnecky, claiming the trans graduate instructor gave her a failing grade because she’s an outspoken Christian who stood up for her beliefs, despite the fact that her thoughts on trans people had literally nothing to do with the assignment, and that a multitude of seasoned professors in and outside of OU read her remedial ramblings and agreed she got the zero grade she deserved. This brings me to my next point, one that I fear is being overlooked even amid the protests: White conservatives who wrongly claim diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives lower the standards for hiring and recruiting are now demanding that the standards of the assignment be lowered so this Christian white woman can receive her passing grade. Look, anyone who knows anything about DEI that isn’t 100% informed by their own racial resentment knows diversity initiatives are about leveling the playing field, and anyone claiming it lowers the standards is falsely assuming the standard was ever the same for everyone in the first place. But let’s say, for the sake of argument, that white conservatives are right and DEI and affirmative action cause institutions to have to lower the bar in order to fill racial or gender quotas. Even if they were correct — which they are not — they still aren’t applying that same non-logic to themselves. In 2023, Gov. Stitt signed an executive order banning DEI measures in the state, signed into law a white fragility bill prohibiting teachings in K-12 schools that include Critical Race Theory — a college-level academic framework that is not taught in K-12 schools — as well as any other race-based curriculum that causes “discomfort, guilt, anguish or psychological distress” to (white) students. (Oklahoma wants to be Florida so bad.) Yet, after being contacted by Funecky and her Jan. 6 defendant lawyer mother, Kristi Fulnecky, about the so-called religious discrimination the 21-year-old faces, he blindly responded by tweeting: “The 1st Amendment is foundational to our freedom & inseparable from a well-rounded education. The situation at OU is deeply concerning. I’m calling on the OU regents to review the results of the investigation & ensure other students aren’t unfairly penalized for their beliefs.” Then there’s Turning Point USA, the organization founded by slain white Christian nationalist Charlie Kirk, who claimed to be afraid of Black pilots because he assumed they were DEI hires, and dedicated his platform to being a mediocre college dropout who blasted some of the most accomplished Black women in America as DEI hires who lacked “the brain processing power to otherwise be taken really seriously,” prompting them to “go steal a white person’s slot.” Turning Point USA once held what it called an “Affirmative Action Bake Sale” in which it charged white customers $1 for baked goods, Hispanic customers 50 cents for the same goods, and Black customers 20 cents — all to make some white, fragile, and ahistorical point about affirmative action being discriminatory to Caucasians. More recently, the organization has planned to invade HBCUs on a campaign to school Black students on the oppressive nature of DEI. Yet, when it comes to failing Fulnecky, Turning Point is giving her and her glaring mediocrity its full support. It’s bad enough that Fulnecky’s supporters are claiming anti-Christian persecution in a country where 60 to 65% of the adult population identifies as some denomination of Christian, and Christianity is so overrepresented in our government that we’re still debating same sex marriage and fighting an effort to put the Bible in classrooms, all because Christian dogma still has a stranglehold on American politics. But now these same people have seemingly abandoned their entire “meritocracy” narrative. Of course, that shouldn’t be surprising since these same people make up MAGA America, who are responsible for President Donald Trump’s administration of woefully underqualified Caucasian reverse DEI hires, all because they couldn’t stomach the possibility of a qualified Black woman like Kamala Harris becoming president. Actually, I’ve written about this before: But white people don’t give a sh*t about merit. They elected Trump in 2020 despite the fact that he had zero experience holding political office, and then they voted him in again after claiming ad nauseam that Harris was woefully underqualified for the presidency despite her eight years as San Francisco’s 27th district attorney, eight years as California’s 32nd attorney general, four years as a U.S. senator and four years as vice president of the United States. Trump doesn’t give a sh*t about merit. For the position of secretary of state, he nominated Pete Hegseth, a former Fox News host with zero national defense experience to replace Lloyd Austin — the Black four-star general who served as our 28th national defense secretary after serving as the 12th commander of U.S. Central Command and the 33rd vice chief of staff of the U.S. Army. During his confirmation hearing, Hegseth was tested on his knowledge of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), and his answer to the line of questioning was something to the effect of: “Shiiiiiet, I know we got homies in Japan and one of them damn Koreas, right?” (I’m paraphrasing, but that’s pretty much what he said.) Hegseth named four countries, none of which are part of ASEAN, but he did so as a born-with-merit white man, so no one is going to call him a “DEI hire.” Truth be told, Fulnecky’s paper was likely a publicity stunt aimed at attacking a trans educator and clout chasing for an elevated MAGA platform, but that wouldn’t change the fact that her campaign is exposing white conservatives for what they are: a bunch of racist hypocrites who are only pretending merit is at the heart of the issue of DEI. It has always been a lie they lean on to play around in our faces; now, they’re just showing us that every allegation they spew is actually a confession. They want DEI for mediocre white people to get ahead. That’s it, and that’s all.

Jasmine Crockett of Texas, the progressive firebrand and vocal critic of President Donald Trump and Republicans, has filed paperwork to run for the U.S. Senate, according to a party spokesperson. A spokesperson for the Texas Democratic Party confirmed to Fox News Digital on Monday that Crockett had filed paperwork to run for the Senate. She is expected to officially launch her Senate campaign on Monday evening in a race that may determine if the GOP holds its majority in the chamber next year. Crockett's campaign announcement, which was expected, will likely further rock a high-profile and heavily contested race in Texas, which, on the Republican side, includes incumbent Sen. John Cornyn and GOP primary rivals state Attorney General Ken Paxton and Rep. Wesley Hunt. The official announcement by the rising-star Democrat, who has a large social media footprint and currently represents a Dallas area district, will come hours after one of the two Democrats already running for the Senate in 2026 abandoned his bid. EX-NFL STAR ABANDONS SENATE BID AS JASMINE CROCKETT NEARS MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT Former Rep. Colin Allred, who was making his second straight bid for the Senate in right-leaning Texas, on Monday morning ended his campaign and instead launched a congressional campaign as he seeks to return to the House. But Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, a former middle school teacher and Presbyterian seminarian who is also seen as a rising Democratic Party star, remains in the Senate primary, setting up a face-off between two surging contenders with formidable fundraising. Talarico responded to Crockett entering the race by saying, \"We’re building a movement in Texas — fueled by record-breaking grassroots fundraising and 10,000 volunteers who are putting in the work to defeat the billionaire mega-donors and puppet politicians who have taken over our state. Our movement is rooted in unity over division — so we welcome Congresswoman Crockett into this race.\" Crockett held an event announcing her decision roughly 90 minutes before the deadline on the final day for candidates to file for the state's March 3 primary. Crockett had teased a possible bid for weeks, and she commissioned polling to make her case for a Senate run in Texas, where no Democrat has won a statewide election in over three decades. Allred, who was making a second straight Senate bid after losing to conservative firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz by roughly 9 points last year, said in a statement that he didn't want to contribute to anything that would splinter Democrats' hopes of flipping the GOP-held Senate seat in next year's elections. \"In the past few days, I’ve come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt,\" Allred wrote. By dropping out of the race, Allred will likely allow Democrats to avoid a costly and messy primary runoff in the spring, giving the party more time to consolidate around their nominee and raise much-needed campaign cash. Meanwhile, with Cornyn, Paxton, and Hunt all taking aim at each other in a combustible primary, the GOP nomination may be headed towards a runoff, which would be triggered if no candidate tops 50% in the primary. The 44-year-old Crockett, who is Black, is a former state representative and civil rights lawyer. She won her seat in 2022 after longtime Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, who was retiring, hand-picked her as his successor in Congress. Crockett, who won re-election last year, has become one of the most well-known Democratic politicians in the country the past couple of years, thanks to her viral jabs at Republicans and her verbal sparing on social media with Trump, who has repeatedly questioned her intelligence. And she's grabbed plenty of headlines during her time on the House Oversight Committee. CROCKET SPENDS EYE-POPPING AMOUNT OF CAMPAIGN CASH ON THIS While her Senate run will likely excite many Democrats, thanks to her energy and her proven fundraising ability, her frequent push-back against GOP politicians may energize Republicans. Among her biggest blunders — calling Abbott, who is partially paralyzed and uses a wheelchair, \"Gov. Hot Wheels.\" Crockett has also compared Trump to Adolf Hitler on multiple occasions while accusing aspects of the Republican Party of fascism. She notably ran for ranking member of the House Oversight Committee earlier this year following the death of its previous top Democrat, the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., but dropped out of the race after failing to win the recommendation of leadership within her party. But the Dallas-area Democrat has won favor with some party leaders, like ex-Vice President Kamala Harris, who revealed in her memoir \"107 Days\" that she mentored Crockett as part of her covert \"Stars Project\" while in office. Crockett spoke at the Democratic National Convention last year when Harris was named the party's presidential candidate, a notable slot for someone who was then a first-term House lawmaker. BIG WIN FOR TRUMP, GOP, AS SUPREME COURT GREENLIGHTS NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAP IN TEXAS She had also been facing some tough decisions in her House race after the new GOP-led Texas congressional map appeared to draw her home out of her current district. Monday's filing deadline came just a few days after the Supreme Court upheld the state's congressional redistricting, which was passed by the GOP-dominated Texas legislature and signed into law by longtime Republican Gov. Greg Abbott. The new map creates five more right-leaning House districts in the Lone Star State and is a key part of Trump’s aggressive national campaign to reshape congressional districts ahead of the 2026 midterms, when GOP will defend its razor-thin House majority. Crockett's entry into the Senate race, and her showdown with Talarico, may shift the spotlight off of the GOP primary, where Cornyn, the longtime incumbent who hails from the party's establishment wing, has cut into the one-time large lead by Paxton, a MAGA firebrand, with Hunt in third. The concern among Republicans is that Paxton, who has been battered over the past decade by a slew of scandals and legal problems and who is now dealing with a messy divorce, would put the seat in play if he won the GOP nomination. But Crockett's Senate candidacy may change the political equation. While her aggressive push-back against Trump and the GOP should play well with the left, it could deflate her chances of winning next November among Texas' general election electorate. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP The National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), the campaign arm of the Senate GOP, this past summer paid for a Democratic primary poll in Texas which showed Crockett the frontrunner by double digits. The publicly released survey was apparently done to encourage Crockett to enter the race, with the GOP assuming she would be more beatable than Allred or Talarico. NRSC communications director Joanna Gonzalez, in a statement to Fox News Digital after Crockett announced, charged that \"Jasmine Crockett leading her primary is the latest sign that the Democrat Party is being run by radical leftists.\" Delanie Bomar, a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee, also chimed in, telling Fox News Digital that \"Jasmine Crockett’s shenanigans are an embarrassment to Texas. Everything's bigger in Texas — except her ability to win this race.\"","summary":"A spokesperson for the Texas Democratic Party confirmed to Fox News Digital on Monday that Rep.

She teased a possible bid for the seat in October.\n\nIf Crockett does run for Cornyn’s seat, she’ll have to go up against Rep. James Talarico (D) in the primary. Talarico, a rising star in the Democratic Party, often goes viral for his takes on Christianity and politics. On Joe Rogan’s podcast, Talarico explained his opposition to displaying the Ten Commandments in schools and why he’s pro-choice, citing the story of Jesus’ mother, Mary. \n\nAs for Allred, he’s setting his sights on the new 33rd Congressional District, which he said was “racially gerrymandered by Trump in an effort to further rig our democracy.”\n\nAllred said the area that’s part of that district is where he grew up and where he now lives with his wife and kids. \n\n“On January 6th I was prepared to physically fight to defend our democracy,” Allred said in a statement. “Today, the danger we face from Donald Trump is even greater and has added a level of corruption and rigging of our economy that has made it harder than ever for Texans. But I’ve never been more confident that together, we can meet this moment. I’m humbly asking to return to Congress — to keep fighting so that kids who are growing up all across the 33rd district can get the same chances as I did.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/colin-allred-drops-out-texas-senate-race_n_6937101de4b013f1f7d265b5?origin=home-latest-news-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69371960190000ec4d7f3916.jpeg?cache=KP2eo6SzFf&ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 19:08:56","author":"Paige Skinner","authors":["Paige Skinner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.166},{"id":386251842,"title":"Trump demands advisers find way to lower all-time high cost of beef as MAGA voters turn on him over affordability","text":"The price of ground beef hit an all-time high this year, with the cost per pound rising to above $6 as the Trump administration looks to make the dinner staple more affordable. \n\nA pound of ground beef currently costs about $6.30, up from $5.60 this time last year – and a far cry from the $3.95 it cost in December 2020, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\nPresident Donald Trump and the Republican Party are facing mounting pressure ahead of the midterm elections as many Americans struggle with affordability, something the president campaigned on.

RIGHT, a free weekly newsletter about modern masculinity)\n\nHence, Biden’s three-week “Investing in America” tour. Biden, along with his wife, Jill, Vice President Kamala Harris, and a slew of senior cabinet officials, traveled to over 20 states selling “Bidenomics.” It inevitably failed. And if Americans came away with anything, it was that Biden was looking increasingly fragile and senile, despite claims from his surrogates to the contrary.\n\nTrump is now following Biden down a similar path toward self-destruction. On Tuesday, he will kick off his own PR tour, starting in Pennsylvania, a state he won in 2024.\n\nThe administration’s economic messaging has already been nothing short of imbecilic, and according to polls and consumer sentiment, Americans are buying none of it. Calling the affordability crisis a Democrat hoax while repeating the phrase “Golden Age” a hundred times over won’t paper over the pain and fear budget-stressed Americans feel every single day. Blaming your predecessor won’t work, either.\n\nNevertheless, Trump will continue to plow forward and try to bend reality to his will, just as Biden and his cabinet did throughout their entire term, whether it was the state of the economy or the state of Biden’s rapidly disintegrating mind. The president will likely address his tariffs and claim they are putting money in the pockets of normal Americans, as he did Sunday night at the Kennedy Center Honors.\n\n“We’re making so much money with tariffs that we’ll also be able to make a nice dividend to middle-income people,” the president said, of course ignoring the fact that the Supreme Court may strike down the “emergency” tariffs as soon as this month, and force the government to repay businesses that have sued.\n\nMeanwhile, Congressional Republicans have no plan to tackle affordability or the rising healthcare premiums in the New Year. As of now, they are solely relying on their one legislative achievement, the mega “One Big Beautiful Bill,” to campaign on for the midterms. Ah, yes, because who doesn’t remember the One Big Beautiful Bill?\n\n“[T]op GOP leaders in Congress are keeping expectations low for major new economic legislation,” Politico reported Monday. “Instead, they are betting on having an easier time addressing affordability questions next month, when new programs enacted as part of the megabill start impacting voters — like no taxes on some tips and overtime income.”\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune even admitted that GOP messaging has been lackluster.\n\n“We haven’t probably messaged as effectively as we should,” he told the outlet. “I think we’ll have lots of opportunities now that we’re getting into an election year to talk about the things we’ve done and how they are going to lead to things being more affordable for the American people, probably starting with tax relief next year.”\n\nRepublican Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley was more blunt about the possibility of GOP-led healthcare reform.\n\n“It’s a disaster,” he said. “Health care, as it currently is, is too expensive for everybody.”\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson seems to be living inside a fantasy bubble, however. Sounding no different than a Biden surrogate in 2022 urging Americans to be patient with the Inflation Reduction Act, Johnson told Politico that voters have not felt the impact of their megabill “because it takes a while for it to be implemented.” By mid-2026, however, “there’s going to be boats rising in the economy, this is going to be a very different situation before we go into the election cycle,” Johnson said.\n\nHe added, “Republicans are dialed in like a laser, with laser focus on the cost of living and affordability.”\n\nDialed in like a laser. Nice talking point, Mr. Speaker.\n\nSo with no serious pushes for legislation on the horizon, Trump and Republicans might have to spend a significant portion of 2026 campaigning on the One Big Beautiful Bill and how it will help normal people (not Wall Street or private equity). And like Biden and his surrogates, they will find out the hard way. When people are financially stressed and do not believe their elected leaders are taking their concerns seriously, there is always hell to pay at the ballot box.","summary":"What do you think?","url":"https://dailycaller.com/2025/12/08/donald-trump-economic-tour-affordability-scott-bessent-joe-biden/","image":"https://images.dailycaller.com/image/width=1280,height=549,fit=cover,format=webp,f=auto/https%3A%2F%2Fcdn01.dailycaller.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2025%2F12%2FGettyImages-2250609381-scaled-e1765207627366.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 17:47:09","author":"John Loftus","authors":["John Loftus"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.154},{"id":386290230,"title":"Bill Maher Gloats About Attacking Jimmy Kimmel’s Wife","text":"Bill Maher admitted that Jimmy Kimmel and his wife, Molly McNearney, are frustrated with him after he publicly attacked McNearney for revealing that she had lost relationships with family members who voted for Trump.\n\n“I was as kid-gloved as I could,” Maher said on the Dec. 7 episode of his Club Random Podcast, while reflecting on his previous slamming of McNearney for giving her relatives an “ultimatum” on his talk show, Real Time With Bill Maher. “And I see they’re mad at me.” \n\n“I’m sorry. I mean, I was being, again, as respectful as I could, but I don’t agree with that point of view,” he said. “And since she went public with it, it wasn’t out of school for me to go public with it.” \n\nThe comedian admitted that he has friends who “didn’t like what I said,” but stood firmly in his beliefs that cutting off relatives isn’t the path forward.\n\n“I’m in the ‘talk to them’ wing of the Democratic Party, I’m not in the ‘cut your people off,’” he said. “Don’t cut them off.”\n\nMaher admitted that he and Kimmel “weren’t close” before his words, but he liked “Jimmy a lot.”\n\n“I love Jimmy. I always have,” he said. “I don’t know him that well, but he’s a great guy. And we have a connection, like we were both fired by ABC.”\n\n“I hope we’re friends forever,” he added. “But I don’t know. You know, the liberals and the woke, that’s a schism. It just is.”\n\nMaher’s reflections stemmed from comments McNearney—who is an executive producer and co-head writer for her husband’s show—made on the We Can Do Hard Things podcast in November. \n\nThere, just months after Kimmel’s late-night show was suspended following controversial remarks made after Charlie Kirk’s assassination, she expressed that her husband is “fighting” Trump daily, which complicated her relationships with family members who supported the president. \n\nMcNearney, who said she “grew up in a very conservative, Republican house” in St. Louis, Missouri, admitted that she has “a little bit of sympathy” for people in her family who are “deliberately being misinformed every day,” but now it feels personal. \n\n“To me, them voting for Trump is them not voting for my husband and me and our family and I unfortunately have kind of lost relationships with people in my family because of it,” she said on the podcast while sitting next to Kimmel, who has long been a vocal critic of Trump, even recently receiving renewed pressure from the president to take his show off the air.\n\n“This is not just Republican vs Democrat for me anymore, to me it’s family values,” she added, noting that when she sees headlines about Trump now, it just makes her “mad at certain aunts, uncles, cousins who put him in power.” \n\nShe also revealed that she had sent emails to her family members before the election with a list of 10 reasons not to vote for Trump, but was either ignored “or got truly insane responses.”\n\n“I’ve definitely pulled in closer with the family that I feel more aligned with. And I hate that this has happened,” she said. “Part of me goes, ‘Don’t let politics get in the way.’ But to me, this isn’t politics. It’s truly values. And we’re just not aligned anymore.”\n\nMaher then addressed the situation on his HBO show, explaining that while he had many issues with Trump himself, he didn’t agree with losing relationships with family members.\n\n“Ten reasons? I can think of 100,” he said on the Nov. 21 episode of Real Time. “But I would never present it to someone as an ultimatum. Ultimatums don’t make people rethink their politics. They make them rethink you.”\n\nHe also said that people like McNearney were part of the reason former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the 2024 presidential election.","summary":"GettyBill Maher admitted that Jimmy Kimmel and his wife, Molly McNearney, are frustrated with him after he publicly attacked McNearney for revealing that she had lost relationships with family members who voted for Trump.\n\n“I was as kid-gloved as I could,” Maher said on the Dec. 7 episode of his Club Random Podcast, while reflecting on his previous slamming of McNearney for giving her relatives an “ultimatum” on his talk show, Real Time With Bill Maher. “And I see they’re mad at me.” \n\nHe then apologized while still defending his words.\n\nRead more at The Daily Beast.","url":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/bill-maher-reveals-falling-out-with-jimmy-kimmel-and-wife-molly-mcnearney-theyre-mad-at-me/","image":"https://www.thedailybeast.com/resizer/v2/SAJ5O7KXEFDT3KK26SD6GZKFFE.jpg?smart=true&auth=035cc24562ec93b8522bf93fc4753a1b3b24eda8056ead0ed1b7f8cee9b80c97&width=1440&height=1080","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 17:43:11","author":"Georgina DiNardo","authors":["Georgina DiNardo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.327},{"id":386236790,"title":"Donald Trump slams '60 Minutes' for Marjorie 'Traitor' Greene interview","text":"President Donald Trump is lashing out at CBS News over a Lesley Stahl interview with Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nTrump took to Truth Social in a Dec. 8 post to address friend-turned-foe Greene after the Georgia congresswoman blamed him for threats against her family and said he had been \"unkind\" to her in recent weeks.\n\nIn his comments, Trump referenced a July legal settlement for $16 million with the network's parent company Paramount over an interview he claimed was edited to favor of former Vice President Kamala Harris during last year's election.\n\n\"THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME!\" Trump wrote. \"Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE!

Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whom the president has called a traitor during their recent feud. CBS' parent company, Paramount, merged with Skydance Media in August, putting new Paramount CEO David Ellison in charge of the company. He quickly tapped Bari Weiss, who built her brand around the notion that legacy outlets suffer from liberal groupthink, to oversee CBS News. Many believed that Trump would find Weiss’ CBS News less objectionable than past management, but the president doesn’t appear to feel that way at the moment. \"My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor [Greene], it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air.

MARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE APOLOGIZES FOR TAKING PART IN 'TOXIC POLITICS' AMID TRUMP ATTACKS Trump, who sat for his own interview on \"60 Minutes\" in early November, said in the social media post that Stahl still owed him an apology over his interview with her in 2020. \"Oh well, far worse things can happen. P.S. I hereby demand a complete and total APOLOGY, though far too late to be meaningful, from Lesley Stahl and 60 Minutes for her incorrect and Libelous statements about Hunter’s Laptop!!!\" the president continued. Stahl famously dismissed a statement made by Trump about former President Joe Biden being embroiled in a scandal with regard to the contents of Hunter Biden's laptop during the \"60 Minutes\" interview in 2020. \"He's not,\" Stahl replied at the time.

Trump also attacked Greene over her interview with the program, which aired on Sunday. Greene recently announced she would be resigning from Congress and will be leaving office next month.

Trump’s attack on Paramount and CBS came the same morning that Ellison launched an all-cash tender offer to acquire outstanding shares of Warner Bros. Discovery for $30 per share in cash in a hostile takeover attempt. Paramount said in a press release that regulatory certainty is among the reasons why it sees itself as a better fit. \"Paramount is highly confident in achieving expeditious regulatory clearance for its proposed offer, as it enhances competition and is pro-consumer, while creating a strong champion for creative talent and consumer choice,\" the press release stated.

The dispute was settled in July, with Trump receiving $16 million upfront to cover legal fees, costs of the case, and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes. The settlement paved the way for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to approve a long-planned merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media that put Ellison in charge of the newly formed company.

Biden and his team rebuffed these warnings, concerned they would lose Latino support and underestimating how much Americans would care about the issue. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Trump Admin Launching New Vetting Unit In Wake Of National Guard Attack)\n\n“A potential surge could create chaos and a humanitarian crisis, overwhelm processing capacities, and imperil the agenda of the new administration,” read a memo created by several aides before the 2020 presidential election, which was obtained by the NYT.\n\nThat memo proved prophetic after Biden immediately got to work on dismantling the border enforcement apparatus established by the first Trump administration and overseeing the largest spike in illegal immigration.\n\nBiden undertook a total of 296 executive actions on immigration in the first year of his presidency, according to an analysis by the Migration Policy Institute. Of these executive actions, 89 reversed or began the process of reversing President Donald Trump’s immigration policies.\n\nThe Democrat scrubbed major initiatives undertaken by the first Trump administration, such as ending border wall construction, the shutdown of the Remain in Mexico program and ending the COVID-era Title 42 health order that quickly expelled migrants.\n\nThose actions quickly paved the way for a flood of illegal migrants descending into the country.\n\nThere were roughly 8.5 million southern border encounters during Biden’s time in the White House, with fiscal year 2023 and fiscal year 2024 being the worst years for migrant crossings in history. These numbers not only overwhelmed federal immigration officials and border states, but also became a problem for local officials in the interior of the country, forcing leaders in New York City, Denver and elsewhere to get tougher on illegal migrants.\n\nAs the situation at the border continued to escalate, the Biden administration reportedly kept rebuffing proposals to stem the situation out of political fears.\n\n“They were a little too sensitive to criticisms from the left,” Cecilia Muñoz, who oversaw domestic and economic policy for the Biden transition team, said to the NYT.\n\nThe crisis dramatically changed Americans’ outlook on immigration enforcement, with polls at the time showing illegal immigration to be a top concern for Americans and more voters believing Trump would better handle the issue than Biden. A February 2024 YouGov survey found a mere 31% of Americans believing Biden to be the better candidate to fix the border, compared to 45% for Trump.\n\nBy the summer of 2024, a majority of Latino voters supported mass deportation of illegal migrants, smashing the Biden administration’s assumption that hawkish border policies would alienate the constituency.\n\nIn the waning days of their administration, both Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris — who eventually became the Democratic presidential nominee — campaigned heavily in favor of a Senate border bill that, they argued, would’ve solved the border crisis. While Biden blamed Trump for not supporting the bill, insiders say the Biden White House initially wanted nothing to do with the legislation.\n\nDemocrat Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy and GOP Oklahoma Sen. James Lankford, the bipartisan pair of lawmakers behind the Senate border bill, said the Biden White House refused to get involved when negotiations first began to gain momentum, according to the NYT.\n\nBy the summer of 2024, Biden finally issued an executive order that restricted the number of border crossings, a move that ultimately helped drive down the border crisis, but came too late for an electorate that had already decided Trump was the better candidate on immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Biden administration “had no strategy, because they had no goal,” Scott Shuchart, who joined the Biden White House in 2022 as a senior adviser at Immigration and Customs Enforcement, told the NYT.\n\n“All they had was wishing the problem would go away so that they could focus on the things they cared about,” Shuchart continued.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Jasmine Crockett of Texas, the progressive firebrand and frequent foil of President Donald Trump, is expected to launch a U.S. Senate campaign on Monday, which is the deadline for candidates to file for the state's March 3 primary. Hours before Crockett — a rising star Democrat with a large social media imprint who represents a Dallas area district — was to hold an event announcing her decision, one of the two Democrats already running for the Senate abandoned his bid. Former Rep. Colin Allred, who was making his second straight bid for the Senate in right-leaning Texas, announced he was ending his campaign and instead would launch a congressional campaign as he seeks to return to the House. But Democratic state Rep. James Talarico, a former middle school teacher and Presbyterian seminarian, remains in the Senate primary, setting up a likely face-off between two surging contenders with formidable fundraising. If Crockett launches a Senate campaign as expected, it would further rock a high-profile and heavily contested race, which, on the Republican side, includes Sen. John Cornyn and GOP primary rivals Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and U.S. House Rep. Wesley Hunt. The contest in Texas is one of the most closely watched Senate showdowns as Democrats try to win back the chamber's majority in next year's midterms. EX-NFL STAR ABANDONS SENATE BID AS JASMINE CROCKETT NEARS MAJOR ANNOUNCEMENT Crockett told CNN this weekend that she's made out two cashier checks, one if she jumps into the Senate campaign and one to submit if she files for re-election in the House. And her down-to-the-wire announcement is scheduled for 90 minutes before the final deadline to submit one of the checks. Crockett has teased a possible Senate run for weeks, telling MS NOW on Sunday that \"I am closer to yes than I am to no.\" And she has said she's commissioned polling to make her case for a Senate run in Texas, where no Democrat has won a statewide election in over three decades. In another sign that she's expected to launch a Senate run, Crockett told the Dallas Morning News that she called both Allred and Talarico to discuss her polling. BIG WIN FOR TRUMP, GOP, AS SUPREME COURT GREENLIGHTS NEW CONGRESSIONAL MAP IN TEXAS Monday's filing deadline comes just a few days after the Supreme Court upheld a new congressional map passed by the GOP-dominated Texas legislature and signed into law by longtime Republican Gov. Greg Abbott that creates five more right-leaning House districts in the Lone Star State. And one of the Texas Democrats whose district had been dramatically altered, Rep. Marc Veasey, had reportedly been discussing with Crockett a plan where he would file for her current House seat shortly after she files to run for the Senate. Allred, who was making a second straight Senate bid after losing to conservative firebrand Sen. Ted Cruz by roughly 9 points last year, said in a statement that he didn't want to contribute to anything that would splinter Democrats' hopes of flipping the GOP-held Senate seat in next year's elections. \"In the past few days, I’ve come to believe that a bruising Senate Democratic primary and runoff would prevent the Democratic Party from going into this critical election unified against the danger posed to our communities and our Constitution by Donald Trump and one of his Republican bootlickers Paxton, Cornyn, or Hunt,\" Allred wrote. By dropping out of the race, Allred will likely allow Democrats to avoid a costly and messy primary runoff in the spring, giving the party more time to consolidate around their nominee and raise much-needed campaign cash. Meanwhile, with Cornyn, Paxton, and Hunt all taking aim at each other in a combustible primary, the GOP nomination may be headed towards a runoff, which would be triggered if no candidate tops 50% in the primary. CROCKET SPENDS EYE-POPPING AMOUNT OF CAMPAIGN CASH ON THIS The 44-year-old Crockett, who is Black, is a former state representative and civil rights lawyer. She won her seat in 2022 after longtime Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, who was retiring, hand-picked her as his successor in Congress. Crockett, who won re-election last year, has become one of the most well-known Democratic politicians in the country the past couple of years, thanks to her viral jabs at Republicans and her verbal sparing on social media with Trump, who has repeatedly questioned her intelligence. And she's grabbed plenty of headlines during her time on the House Oversight Committee. While her expected Senate run will likely excite many Democrats, thanks to her energy and her proven fundraising ability, her frequent push-back against GOP politicians may energize Republicans. Among her biggest blunders — calling Abbott, who is partially paralyzed and uses a wheelchair, \"Gov. Hot Wheels.\" Crockett has also compared Trump to Adolf Hitler on multiple occasions while accusing aspects of the Republican Party of fascism. She notably ran for ranking member of the House Oversight Committee earlier this year following the death of its previous top Democrat, the late Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., but dropped out of the race after failing to win the recommendation of leadership within her party. But the Dallas-area Democrat has won favor with some party leaders, like ex-Vice President Kamala Harris, who revealed in her memoir \"107 Days\" that she mentored Crockett as part of her covert \"Stars Project\" while in office. Crockett spoke at the Democratic National Convention last year when Harris was named the party's presidential candidate, a notable slot for someone who was then a first-term House lawmaker. She had also been facing some tough decisions in her House race after the new GOP-led Texas congressional map appeared to draw her home out of her current district. Crockett's expected entry into the Senate race will shift the spotlight off of the GOP primary, where Cornyn, the longtime incumbent who hails from the party's establishment wing, has cut into the one-time large lead by Paxton, a MAGA firebrand, with Hunt in third. The concern among Republicans is that Paxton, who has been battered over the past decade by a slew of scandals and legal problems and who is now dealing with a messy divorce, would put the seat in play if he won the GOP nomination. CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP But a Crockett candidacy would likely change the political equation. While her aggressive push-back against Trump and the GOP would play well with the left, it could deflate her chances of winning next November among Texas' general election electorate. The National Republican Senatorial Committee, the campaign arm of the Senate GOP, this past summer paid for a Democratic primary poll in Texas which showed Crockett the frontrunner by double digits. The publicly released survey was apparently done to encourage Crockett to enter the race, with the GOP assuming she would be more beatable than Allred or Talarico.","summary":"Rep.

Discovery after Netflix beat Paramount for the studio giant. Throughout the bidding process, Ellison felt he had a “Trump card” in his back pocket due to his and his father’s close ties to the president.\n\nMaking Trump’s broadside against CBS News’ parent company even more remarkable is that it came at the same time it was revealed that the president’s son-in-law is one of the investors in Ellison’s hostile bid for Warner.\n\nIn her first major interview since announcing that she was resigning from Congress amid her public fallout with Trump, Greene – a longtime MAGA loyalist – told 60 Minutes correspondent Lesley Stahl that the president was “directly fueling” death threats against her and her family.\n\n“After President Trump called me a traitor, I got a pipe bomb threat on my house. And then I got several direct death threats on my son,” Greene said on Sunday’s broadcast, noting that some of the threats included Trump’s new insulting nickname for her.\n\n“The subject line for the direct death threats against my son was his words – Marjorie Traitor Greene,” the former MAGA cheerleader answered. “Those are death threats directly fueled by President Trump.”\n\nElsewhere in the interview, Greene – who has split with the GOP on a number of issues this past year, including the release of the Jeffrey Epstein files – said that Trump said something that “wasn’t very nice” and “extremely unkind” when she personally brought up the threats to him.\n\nReacting to Greene’s sitdown with the preeminent newsmagazine, the president unleashed a multi-pronged tirade on Truth Social that featured him raging about CBS News’ past coverage of Hunter Biden’s laptop while fuming about Greene, whom he now deems a “very dumb person” who does not represent his political movement.\n\nAt the same time, Trump also referenced the $16 million that Paramount’s previous leadership paid him to settle a “meritless” lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris while raging about the new owners. In the president’s view, Ellison and CBS News management should have never allowed Greene’s interview to air, adding that the Sunday night news show has “gotten worse” since the Paramount-Skydance merger that Trump has incessantly celebrated.\n\n“The only reason Marjorie ‘Traitor’ Brown (Green turns Brown under stress!) went BAD is that she was JILTED by the President of the United States (Certainly not the first time she has been jilted!),” Trump griped online. “Too much work, not enough time, and her ideas are, NOW, really BAD - She sort of reminds me of a Rotten Apple! Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA, because nobody could have changed her views so fast, and her new views are those of a very dumb person.”\n\nIn response to Trump’s attack on Monday, Greene took to X and wrote, “I AM AMERICA FIRST.” She also included two side-by-side images that show she has not received any donations from the pro-Israel lobbying group AIPAC and “condemns Israel for committing genocide” in Gaza, all while the president has taken over $200 million from “pro-Israel interest groups.”\n\nCalling Stahl a “washed up, Trump hating” reporter, the president said she still owes him an apology over how she covered the Hunter Biden ‘LAPTOP FROM HELL” before complaining that she interviewed “a very poorly prepared Traitor.” At the same time, he went off on the direction of 60 Minutes, which recently conducted a lengthy interview with him following the merger and settlement, and blasted the new Ellison-led leadership of Paramount.\n\n“My real problem with the show, however, wasn’t the low IQ traitor, it was that the new ownership of 60 Minutes, Paramount, would allow a show like this to air. THEY ARE NO BETTER THAN THE OLD OWNERSHIP, who just paid me millions of Dollars for FAKE REPORTING about your favorite President, ME!” Trump raged.\n\n“Since they bought it, 60 Minutes has actually gotten WORSE! Oh well, far worse things can happen,” he concluded. “P.S. I hereby demand a complete and total APOLOGY, though far too late to be meaningful, from Lesley Stahl and 60 Minutes for her incorrect and Libelous statements about Hunter’s Laptop!!!”\n\nWhile the president is now trashing Paramount and claiming that CBS News has gotten worse since Ellison took over the company, it was just last month when he gushed to 60 Minutes – in comments that weren’t aired on the television broadcast – about the chairman and CBS News’ new “anti-woke” editor-in-chief Bari Weiss.\n\n“I see good things happening in the news. I really do,” he cheerfully declared during that interview. “And I think one of the best things to happen is this show and new ownership, CBS and new ownership.

But Zohran Mamdani and his aides say their high-intensity canvassing effort was a difference-maker in both beating Andrew Cuomo in the Democratic primary and then preventing the former governor from mounting a comeback in the New York City mayoral general election last month, which Mamdani won by about 9 points. Mamdani’s field operation embraced risk and de-emphasized scripts in its strategy to reach voters directly, said eight campaign officials, volunteers and political observers, offering a potential road map for Democratic canvassing efforts in the midterm elections and beyond. Mamdani and his campaign oriented his volunteers not only to juice turnout in favorable neighborhoods along the East River in Brooklyn and Queens, but also to persuade voters in majority-Black precincts who were seen as more skeptical of his upstart bid, as well as New Yorkers who backed Donald Trump in 2024 after, in many cases, having previously supported Democrats. And while canvassers were armed with scripts detailing how to approach conversations, the campaign told volunteers they should feel free to share their personal stories with voters about why they were willing to do voter outreach on behalf of Mamdani, the 34-year-old self-described democratic socialist. In total, more than 100,000 people volunteered for Mamdani’s campaign, knocking on more than 3.1 million doors, making 4.6 million calls and sending 2.7 million text messages to New Yorkers, his campaign said. “When I had been preparing to run for mayor, I had heard from many that races at the scale of a mayoral one were not contested through field programs,” Mamdani said in an interview. “And we believed differently from the very beginning that we could build a program at a scale that the city had never seen before and do so focused on the belief that our most effective messengers were New Yorkers themselves.” Yasmin Radjy, the executive director of Swing Left, a Democratic voter outreach group, said Mamdani’s team made three strategic decisions that she believes should inform Democratic campaigns across the midterm landscape: invest heavily in a ground operation, allow canvassers to go off-script, and spend time connecting with voters who might not be in so-called targeted groups. She said Mamdani’s campaign showed that “leaning into risk is the lower-risk option” for voter contact. Radjy’s group, which is working with several Democratic campaigns, is undertaking a project dubbed “Ground Truth,” the goal of which is to build a team that knocks on every door in battleground House districts, not just those of targeted homes, which is often where limited resources are focused. “Our approach is that you should knock every door,” Radjy said, adding that, in her opinion, Democrats generally focus too much on targeting specific groups — a trap the Mamdani campaign avoided. “They both went everywhere, in the sense of they went to neighborhoods and parts of the city where people typically don’t vote … and they went to neighborhoods and parts of the city where people did not like Zohran, were very skeptical of Zohran,” she added. “And rather than shy away from tough conversations, they really leaned into that. And I think that is something that as a Democratic Party writ large, we need to learn.” Democrats have long embraced that kind of face-to-face voter engagement, a space where they have built-in advantages over Republicans, who have similarly poured resources into canvassing. Democratic-leaning areas — denser, more urban neighborhoods — are easier to traverse in less time than more spread-out exurbs and rural locales. And whether it would be college students or union members, Democrats are able to tap into a wider volunteer base to conduct some of that work. Still, a far more expansive Democratic direct outreach effort fell short in 2024 against a Trump campaign that prioritized narrowly targeting low-propensity voters. Then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign spent a combined $25.4 million on text message outreach, canvassing, phone calls and direct mail in the final weeks of the race, far outpacing the Trump team’s spending. “I think what we have seen across Democratic campaigns at every level, from presidential down to city council, school board, etc., is the metrics that we are optimizing for are how many doors knocked and how many calls made,” Radjy said. “What we are not optimizing for is how many quality conversations we are having. And that is just not measured.” In the interview, Mamdani said he believes canvassing “personalizes” the campaign, emphasizing such conversations. “What I often share with canvassers is that they will likely be the only person that many New Yorkers speak to about this race beyond the people that they already know in their life,” he said. “They will be the ambassador of this campaign, and the most compelling thing that they can do is not memorize a talking point or a statistic but rather tell the truth of why they are walking up six-floor walk-ups, building after building, why they are going through 10 consecutive not-homes to still knock on that 11th door where they are spending hours of their day speaking to strangers about the city that we all love. That is, in fact, the most compelling thing.” Mamdani’s campaign said the effect of its field program on last month’s election can be seen in a few ways. For starters, more than 150,000 voters who registered since the 2024 election cast ballots last month, a phenomenon his aides believe was driven in large part by his candidacy and buttressed by tenacious volunteers who helped register new voters. They also point to efforts in majority-Black neighborhoods like Canarsie and East New York, where Mamdani won by 20-plus points last month after Cuomo ran up substantial victories in the primary. “Don’t be afraid to talk to people,” Tunbosun Oyenuga, a Mamdani volunteer who canvassed Black voters initially set on backing Cuomo, told NBC News of lessons Democrats can take forward. “Just talk to them, especially neighborhoods that you think are standoffish. If you’re willing to hold a town hall in Republican districts, why can’t you talk to your constituents about the problems that they have and do something about it?” Oyenuga, who had previously canvassed for former Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., during his failed primary campaign against now-Rep. George Latimer last year, said Mamdani, a left-wing candidate in alignment with Bowman, had several advantages Bowman did not, aside from a far more favorable electorate. Oyenuga said voters he spoke with were much more open to Mamdani’s perspective on the war in Gaza, which had, by Election Day, reached its second year, than they were to Bowman’s a year previously. And Mamdani’s focus on affordability was a campaign theme that could attract people across the ideological spectrum. “It was easier,” Oyenuga said, “being able to talk about other issues, as well. Everyone’s going through a cost-of-living crisis. Everyone is dealing with affordability.” What’s more, Mamdani and his team have cited exit polling that showed he won 1 in 10 Trump voters who turned out to vote in November, another sign that his efforts to reach out to skeptics bore fruit. Laura Kane, a Mamdani campaign volunteer who was initially leaning toward supporting Cuomo, said Mamdani’s affordability message, combined with his willingness to engage with skeptics, set the tone for his operation. “Mamdani’s intent from the beginning was to go out and engage with people whose views were different from him,” she said, adding, “There’s probably something in that I think Democrats could learn from.” Rich Azzopardi, a senior aide to Cuomo, said the Mamdani canvassing effort was “a factor, but not the whole story” in his win, adding the divisive race “inspired turnout on both sides.” “In many ways he was one of the weaker nominees in history,” Azzopardi said, adding, “Mamdani got barely over 50%, meaning nearly half the voters took time out of their day to vote against him. Now he needs to govern for all New Yorkers.” NBC News spoke with five of Mamdani’s volunteers, as well as Tascha Van Auken, the campaign’s field director, who said the canvassing operation reinforced the importance of Mamdani’s affordability focus, which was similarly an easy subject for volunteers to speak about with voters off the cuff. “You just have to be speaking to what people are dealing with,” Van Auken said. “And definitely in New York City, before this campaign, it really felt like there was a lack of people, leaders, elected officials acknowledging what people were dealing with on a day-to-day basis. So I think that’s a big piece of it. And then that allows people to come in and speak from the heart … because they’re seeing it, they’re feeling it.” Van Auken said the field operation was able to provide the campaign with important feedback in the final weeks of the race — including that voters were repeatedly bringing up concerns at the doors about how Mamdani would handle Trump’s ramped-up attention on the city should he win, expressing concerns over potential National Guard deployments or new Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids. The campaign was also able to bolster its volunteer ranks with some novel events — including a soccer tournament and a scavenger hunt — and it also distributed campaign merchandise that could be earned only through volunteer work, not purchased. Van Auken recalled the first such merchandise drop at a canvassing event over the winter for blue beanies. “The sign-ups just skyrocketed,” she said. “The excitement was just incredible. And it was really cool to have all these canvasses launching across the city and everybody wearing these beanies.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/democrats-zohran-mamdani-outreach-efforts-rcna246862","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-06/250625-zohran-mamdani-ew-117p-540323.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 16:02:58","author":"Allan Smith","authors":["Allan Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.185},{"id":386224268,"title":"Trump rages against 'rotten apple' MTG and demands 'total apology' from CBS","text":"In a Monday morning Truth Social rant, President Donald Trump rails at Rep.

Discovery — as Trump warns Netflix deal ‘could be a problem’","text":"Paramount Skydance on Monday launched a hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery after it accepted an offer from Netflix – even as President Trump warned that the Netflix deal “could be a problem” with his antitrust regulators.\n\nParamount is making its case directly to shareholders with an all-cash, $30-per-share offer to take over the entire company – the same bid that WBD rejected last week, The Post previously reported.\n\nThe offer is backed with equity from the Ellison family and RedBird Capital along with debt fully committed by Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.\n\nParamount is arguing the deal “provides superior value, and a more certain and quicker path to completion to WBD shareholders,” according to a press release out Monday.\n\n“We’re really here to finish what we started,” CEO David Ellison told CNBC’s “Squawk on the Street” on Monday.\n\nNetflix on Friday announced a $72 billion acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery’s studio and streaming business, worth $82.7 billion when including debt.\n\nThe deal could create a Hollywood mammoth that owns everything from “Stranger Things” and “Squid Game” to the “Harry Potter” and “Batman” franchises, and combine more than 400 million streaming subscribers from Netflix and HBO Max under one roof.\n\nTrump on Sunday said the deal “could be a problem,” adding that he’ll be involved in the merger’s approval process.\n\n“Well, that’s got to go through a process, and we’ll see what happens,” Trump told reporters Sunday on the red carpet at the Kennedy Center Awards in Washington.\n\n“I’ll be involved in that decision, too. But they have a very big market share,” he said of Netflix. “When they have Warner Bros., that share goes up a lot.”\n\n“There’s no question about it. It could be a problem,” he added.\n\nTrump said he would consult “some economists” before approving the deal, suggesting he’ll be involved in an antitrust review of the merger.\n\nThe president also confirmed he met with Netflix CEO Ted Sarandos at the White House last week ahead of the deal.\n\n“I met with Ted. I think he’s fantastic,” Trump told reporters. “I have a lot of respect for him but it’s a lot of market share, so we’ll have to see what happens.”\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Bloomberg reported that Sarandos left the meeting with the impression that the deal would not face immediate opposition from the White House.\n\nSince the deal does not include broadcast stations, it would not require FCC approval, but it is likely to face intense antitrust scrutiny from the US Department of Justice, European Commission and other global regulators.\n\nNetflix’s deal only includes Warner Bros. film and TV studios, HBO and HBO Max, while Paramount is bidding for the entirety of the company, including TV networks like CNN, Discovery and TNT Sports.\n\nLast week, Paramount sent two letters to WBD’s lawyers and CEO David Zaslav questioning the “fairness and adequacy” of the auction, arguing a deal with Netflix would “never close,” according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn a response later that week, WBD said the company has “robustly complied” with fiduciary obligations.\n\nSenior White House officials have already met to discuss antitrust concerns about a potential WBD-Netflix merger, The Post reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called the deal an “anti-monopoly nightmare,” while a group of anonymous film producers sent a letter to Congress with “grave concerns” about a top streamer taking over a box-office giant like WBD.\n\nBut the deal includes a promise from Netflix to continue theatrical movie releases for WBD – a big change for the streaming giant.\n\nNetflix and HBO Max will continue to be run separately, but the company didn’t clarify whether it plans to offer any Netflix-HBO Max bundles, or whether the deal would lead to any price changes for streaming subscribers.\n\nIn a statement, Netflix said the deal would bring “more choice and greater value” to customers.\n\nIf approved, the acquisition comes close on the heels of an $8.4 billion merger of Skydance Media and Paramount Global in July, which was approved after months of back and forth over antitrust and political concerns.\n\nThe FCC finally greenlit the deal after Skydance vowed to scrap DEI at Paramount and appoint a media bias ombudsman at CBS News.\n\nParamount also agreed to pay $16 million to Trump’s future presidential library to settle a lawsuit over a “60 Minutes” interview with his then-opponent, former Vice President Kamala Harris, that he argued was deceptively edited.","summary":"Paramount is making its case directly to shareholders with an all-cash, $30-per-share offer to take over the entire company.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/12/08/business/paramount-skydance-launches-hostile-bid-for-warner-bros-discovery-as-trump-warns-netflix-deal-could-be-a-problem/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/12/116984171.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tdTZFJQq-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-12-08 15:28:04","author":"Taylor Herzlich","authors":["Taylor Herzlich"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":386274962,"title":"Trump will talk prices at Pennsylvania stop as ally says he has few quick-fix options","text":"President Donald Trump will address high prices and a stubborn economy when he stops by a Pennsylvania swing county Tuesday to sell his fiscal message to the battleground state. But one key Senate ally acknowledged there’s little he can do with the stroke of a pen or single legislative plan on the issue of affordability. \n\nDemocratic lawmakers see the topic as a strategic opportunity heading into next year’s midterms, coming on the heels of key wins in the November off-year elections and an overperformance in a recent House special election in a deep-red Tennessee district. Several Democratic senators expressed surprise last week over Trump seeming to dismiss voters’ concerns about high prices by calling the issue a “hoax.”\n\n“Just about everything is down,” the president said on Dec. 3 during an Oval Office event. “They use the word affordability. It’s a Democrat hoax. They’re the ones that drove the prices up.”\n\nBut polling shows voters disagree. According to a RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys, 62.2 percent disapproved of Trump’s handling of inflation, while 34.8 approved. \n\nAmong those critic is longtime Trump loyalist-turned-foe Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who has publicly called out the president over the state of Americans’ collective cost of living.\n\n“Affordability is a real issue,” the Georgia Republican told CBS’ “60 Minutes” in an interview that aired Sunday. Asked by reporter Leslie Stahl about Trump’s description of the issue as a hoax,” Greene replied, “It’s one of the top issues. Not only in my district, it’s across the country.”\n\nTrump fired back Monday morning on his Truth Social platform, again referring to Greene as a “traitor.”\n\n“Marjorie is not AMERICA FIRST or MAGA, because nobody could have changed her views so fast, and her new views are those of a very dumb person,” he said of the congresswoman, who has said she will resign from the House next month. \n\nBefore affordability became the latest Trump-Greene flash point, one Republican senator who typically votes with Trump said that when it comes to inflation and prices, any president would be forced to play the long game.\n\n“In a macro-sense, there’s not much with a specific piece of legislation or an [executive order]. What he can do is try not to overregulate the economy. Spur as much competition in our economy as possible — that impacts prices. Stop deficit spending, which devalues our currency,” Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson said when asked what specific actions Trump could take to lower prices.\n\nJohnson said affordability was “an absolutely real issue” while harking back to actions that preceded Trump’s second term.\n\n“It’s all caused by the massive deficit spending during the pandemic and after the four-year-high inflation that drove prices up. Some commodity prices, like energy, are coming down. Eggs are coming down, yeah, but nowhere to the level they were,” the Senate Budget Committee member added. “That’s the problem.”\n\nAcross the Capitol, several veteran House Democrats said their Republican colleagues appeared more worried about affordability than the president. But Reps. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts and James E. Clyburn of South Carolina accused House GOP leaders of resisting pressure to craft price-targeting legislation, saying they have been carrying Trump’s water at the expense of the American people.\n\n“The speaker of the House is more interested in staying on Donald Trump’s Christmas card list than he is in making sure that millions of people” have more money in their pockets and savings accounts, McGovern said Thursday.\n\nClyburn also said he doubts any such measures were likely to hit the House floor. “For 10 years, I’ve heard about a plan,” he said Thursday. “Well, I’ve never seen a plan, alright?”\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, however, told Politico that his party was “dialed in like a laser” on the issue and that voters had not yet begun to feel the effects of the massive tax and spending law that Republicans enacted this summer. \n\nBy the middle of 2026, “there’s going to be boats rising in the economy, this is going to be a very different situation before we go into the election cycle,” Johnson told the news outlet.\n\nTrump on Tuesday is scheduled to head to Pennsylvania’s Monroe County to make the case that his administration has a plan to tackle high prices. While Hillary Clinton narrowly carried the Northeastern Pennsylvania county in 2016 and Joe Biden won it by 7 points four years later, Trump finished ahead of Kamala Harris by less than a point last year on his way to winning the Keystone State for the second time. \n\nMonroe County is split between Pennsylvania’s 7th and 8th districts — both GOP-held battleground seats that Democrats are targeting next year. Its selection could also reflect an acknowledgement by the Trump team that Republicans have work to do on the affordability issue. His previous visits to Pennsylvania and other swing states for official events and rallies have largely taken place in safe red territory.\n\n‘Out of control’\n\nDemocratic lawmakers and officials often seem surprised at Trump’s current message on affordability — or the lack of one — less than 11 months from elections that will decide control of Congress — and the fate of his remaining domestic agenda.\n\n“His dismissing affordability as a ‘hoax’ is so patently out of touch. It speaks for itself,” Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Thursday. Asked if he thought Trump had learned anything from last month’s election results, the Democrat said, “No, no, he didn’t.”\n\n“It’s pretty obvious that the American people are concerned about affordability, the cost of living, prices of electricity, food, groceries, rent — all of it out of control,” Blumenthal added.\n\nFormer Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus, who served as Trump’s chief of staff during his first term, said his former boss remains irked at how Republicans talk about prices. \n\n“What he’s cranky about is the fact that some of the messaging on the Republican side isn’t where it needs to be,” Priebus said Sunday on “This Week” on ABC News. “I mean, he had the huge tax bill. Gas prices are down. Inflation, from where it was a year ago, is in a much better place, and I think it’s going to take some time for it to come around.”\n\n“Them getting hammered on affordability is making him cranky, that’s true. But I think, all in all, he’s got a lot to be proud of,” the former RNC chair said.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2025/12/08/trump-inflation-affordability-pennsylvania-rally/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2250009902.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 15:17:56","author":"Posted December 8, 2025 At 3:17pm, Updated At 4:17pm","authors":["Posted December 8, 2025 At 3:17pm, Updated At 4:17pm"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":386186244,"title":"'Chance some of this backfires': GOP grows anxious over Trump’s redistricting gambit","text":"Months ago, when President Donald Trump urged Texas to redraw its congressional maps in a manner that — he said — would hand Republicans an additional five seats in the U.S. House of Representatives, he launched what has become a sweeping mid-decade redistricting push spanning more than a dozen red and blue states.\n\nTrump has pressed additional GOP-led states to join Texas in mid-decennial redistricting — a rare exercise given that congressional districts, per the U.S. Constitution, are reapportioned based on each decade’s census.

But Trump’s standing with Latino voters has fallen off a cliff in recent months.”\n\nThe Post cited a November Pew Research Center survey that “found 70 percent of Latinos ‘disapprove of the way Trump is handling his job as president,’ and 61 percent said ‘Trump’s economic policies have made economic conditions worse,’ a notable finding because the economy was a primary reason 43 percent of Latino voters backed Trump in 2024.”\n\nPollster and former advisor to Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 presidential campaign, Matt A.

That finding should be setting off alarms for the Republican Party ahead of the midterm elections — especially since health care costs are about to skyrocket for millions of Americans. \n\nA Politico poll, conducted by Public First, which surveyed almost 2,100 U.S. adults Nov. 14 to 17, found that 46% of Americans say the cost of living is the worst they can recall. The perception of the economy did not fall along partisan lines: A 37% plurality of people who voted tor Trump last year expressed that sentiment. (Thirty-four percent of 2024 Trump voters said, “The cost of living here is bad, but I can remember times when it was worse,” and 24% said, “The cost of living here is not bad.”)\n\nAlmost 1 in 5 Trump voters think he’s entirely responsible for today’s economy.\n\nThe poll also asked who should be held accountable for the state of the economy, and that’s not promising news for Trump, either. While 37% of 2024 Trump voters believe former President Joe Biden holds full responsibility for the current state of the economy, 18% say Trump holds full responsibility for the current economy, and 7% say the responsibility lies mainly with Trump, though somewhat with Biden. A separate 14% say the responsibility lies equally between them, and 18% say the responsibility lies mainly with Biden, though somewhat with Trump. \n\nTo recap: Huge swathes of the country think there is an affordability crisis in America, almost 1 in 5 Trump voters think he’s entirely responsible for today’s economy, and a majority of them think he’s at least partially responsible.\n\nA New York Times polling analysis published Friday suggests that increasing voter disapproval of Trump’s handling of the economy could explain his decline in approval ratings in recent weeks. As the Times points out, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found that just 26% of Americans said Trump was doing a good job at managing the cost of living.\n\n“Affordability” has become a watchword in American politics across the political spectrum.\n\n“Affordability” has become a watchword in American politics across the political spectrum. New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani ran a campaign laser-focused on addressing the issue and managed to win after starting at 1% in the polls this year. Trump took note. When the two met in the Oval Office in November, Trump said that they shared common ground on the issue. “We had some interesting conversation, and some of his ideas really are the same ideas I have,” Trump said. “The new word is ‘affordability.’”\n\nBut in a classic display of his mercurial temperament and incoherent policy vision, Trump has simultaneously denied that there is an affordability crisis at all, calling the concern a “con job by the Democrats.”\n\nAs my colleague Steve Benen recently put it, “Maybe the president doesn’t have any ideas about what to do about the cost of living; maybe he’s convinced himself that his absurdities are true. Whatever the motivation, Trump spent parts of his latest White House Cabinet meeting insisting that Americans shouldn’t believe their lying eyes — or wallets.”\n\nRecent political history should be instructive for the GOP — inflation is the biggest, simplest explanation for former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump in 2024. The Biden administration erred politically in trying to convince people they were wrong about the economy instead of taking additional steps to tackle it with a bolder policy vision. Trump, forever immune to facts and addicted to tariffs, seems likely to lead his party down the wrong path as well.","url":"https://www.ms.now/opinion/trump-poll-cost-living-economy-affordability","image":"https://res.cloudinary.com/msnow/images/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630/f_auto,q_auto/v1764960193/251205-trump-affordability-pi/251205-trump-affordability-pi.jpg?_i=AA","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-12-08 14:53:33","author":"Zeeshan Aleem","authors":["Zeeshan Aleem"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.436},{"id":386202198,"title":"Trump says Netflix-Warner Bros. merger ‘could be a problem’","text":"“Netflix is a great company. … They have a very big market share. And when they have Warner Bros., that market share goes up a lot. So, I don’t know. That’s gonna be for some economists to tell, and I’ll be involved in that decision, too. But it is a big market share, no question about it. Could be a problem,” he added.\n\nNetflix said on Friday it would purchase Warner Bros. Discovery’s film studio, HBO, and the streaming service HBO Max, along with decades of films and shows in the Warner Bros. Pictures archive for over $82 billion, if the deal is approved. For now, the HBO Max and Netflix streaming services will remain separate, and TV channels CNN and TNT will not be included.\n\nNetflix won over Warner Bros. against competitors Paramount and Comcast. David Ellison, Trump ally Larry Ellison’s son and the head of Paramount, lost out to Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos. Paramount made the case that the deal would likely not be approved by regulators if it involved Netflix.\n\n“The simple truth is that a deal with Netflix as the buyer likely will never close … Netflix is the only remaining Big Tech company that has not faced serious global antitrust enforcement, but attempting to acquire the WBD assets will change that,” the company’s attorneys wrote in a letter.\n\nThe deal will likely face scrutiny from the Justice Department’s antitrust division, but probably not from the Federal Communications Commission, because neither company owns broadcast stations. FCC head Brendan Carr previously told the Guardian that he doubted the agency would get involved if Paramount acquired Warner Bros.\n\n“I’d be very surprised if there was an FCC role at all in that type of transaction,” Carr said, adding that he was “not focused on the rumor mills around those transactions.”\n\nThe deal will also likely require approval from the European Commission and regulators, among others.\n\nSarandos met with Trump in November about the deal and reportedly left feeling good that Netflix wouldn’t face pushback from the White House. Trump told him that Warner Bros. should sell to the highest bidder, Bloomberg reported.\n\nTrump confirmed his past meeting with Sarandos on Sunday. “I met with Ted. I think he’s fantastic. I think, in the history of Hollywood, there’s almost nothing like what he’s done,” Trump said.\n\nThe Trump administration approved the Paramount Global merger with film studio Skydance in July after Paramount paid Trump’s presidential library $16 million over CBS News’s allegedly deceptively edited interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nParamount also agreed to end its diversity, equity, and inclusion programs after talks with the FCC.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) expressed disagreement Sunday with Trump’s involvement in the merger.\n\n“Donald Trump said ‘he’ll ‘be involved in’ deciding if Netflix can buy Warner Bros. Is that an open invite for CEOs to curry favor with Trump in exchange for merger approvals? It should be an independent decision by the Department of Justice based on the law and facts,” she wrote on X.\n\nNETFLIX TO ACQUIRE WARNER BROS. IN BLOCKBUSTER ENTERTAINMENT DEAL\n\nIf the deal goes through, there’s concern that Netflix will try to shift Warner Bros. operations to a home audience against cinemas. Sarandos told investors that it plans to maintain Warner Bros. operations and “build on its strengths, including theatrical releases for films.”\n\nCinema United, a trade association for cinema owners, called the merger “an unprecedented threat to the global exhibition business.”","summary":"President Donald Trump voiced skepticism over Netflix’s blockbuster deal to acquire Warner Bros.

Anyone who would defend these sick monsters must be stupid, or is it slow?”\n\nThe White House has not yet commented on why the first Carpenter video was deleted. The “Juno” bit was just the latest example of the Trump administration pairing pop and rock hits with its political agenda in a manner that has irked a number of the artists.\n\nCarpenter was a vocal supporter of Trump’s 2024 election rival Vice President Kamala Harris and is the latest in an increasingly long line of musicians who’ve criticized the meme-loving White House for using their music in political videos without their permission. Earlier this year, Kenny Loggins bashed Trump for using his Top Gun song “Danger Zone” under an AI-generated video in which the president appeared to spray a river of fecal matter on American citizens participating in the anti-Trump “No Kings” protests.\n\nIn addition, Swifties were furious at the White House last month over a TikTok video set to Swift’s Billboard Hot 100 chart-topping single “The Fate of Ophelia” — renamed “The Fate of America” — featuring Trump’s mug shot from when he was charged with trying to overturn the 2020 presidential election results and images of POTUS kissing an American flag.\n\nGet weekly rundowns straight to your inbox\n\nWant to know what everyone in the music business is talking about?\n\nGet in the know on\n\nVisit Billboard Pro for music business news\n\nBillboard is a part of Penske Media Corporation. © 2025 Billboard Media, LLC.

Today is Monday, Dec. 8, 2025. Today in history:\n\n2024: Syrian President Bashar al-Assad resigns and flees to Moscow\n\n1987: The Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian Territories begins.\n\n1965: Pope Paul VI closes the final session of the Second Vatican Council.\n\n1863: Abraham Lincoln issues his Amnesty Proclamation and plan for Reconstruction of the South.\n\n1776: Washington crosses the Delaware.\n\nBirthdays today include Ann Coulter, Jim Morrison, and Mary Queen of Scots\n\nThese sentiments came out loudly from the top down. President Bill Clinton, back in 1993, said in his State of the Union, “The simple fact is that we must not — and we will not — surrender our borders to those who wish to exploit our history of compassion and justice.”\n\nBarack Obama was named “Deporter in Chief” by his far-left critics. (That’s hard to imagine, even today, anyone being farther to the left than Obama, but there it is.)\n\nSo why the change, then? Why the move from being, at least verbally, immigration hawks, to being what is best described as the party of the open border — aside, of course, from the notion of bringing new Democrat voters in, since American citizens aren't voting for them anymore?\n\nDespite his public positions and the large number of deportations on his watch, Obama was the one who started DACA, which, among other things, allowed illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to remain and obtain work authorization. \n\nThere has been much speculation with a fair amount of backing evidence, suggesting that Obama drove much of Joe Biden’s foreign policy.\n\nOn his first day in office, Biden placed a 100-day moratorium on just about all deportations and limited ICE’s enforcement to only those with what he called serious criminal records. The executive order on deportations was overturned in the courts almost immediately.\n\nHe then appointed Kamala Harris to oversee the challenges faced at our southern border, which resulted in absolutely nothing being done. As it turned out, Harris is remarkably good at doing nothing. (That would seem a major reason for the pasting she took last November, even amongst the Democrat voters.)\n\nThe result was that by the end of his four years, the number of illegal border crossings was setting records every month, essentially going four times over what we saw under President Donald Trump in his first term. All of which, in turn, led the voters to put President Trump back in the Oval Office. So weak was the Democrats' position that Trump not only won the electoral vote but also the popular vote.\n\nIndeed, so wildly unpopular were the moves by Biden and his administration that polling from the deepest of cities, like New York and Chicago, showed serious worry that the cities couldn’t handle the influx created by Biden’s misbegotten policies, which I hasten to add, the Democrats are still looking to reinstate, apparently not having determined why most of their collectivist backside is missing at the hands of the voters.\n\nThe Democrats made the misguided choice of doubling down on Joe Biden’s policies, which contained the politically expedient knee-jerk of opposition to anything Orange Man Bad came up with, but little else.\n\nAll of this leaves the Democrats in the position of trying to defend the disaster that is their immigration policies. Alongside this is the move everyone has seen: Democrats desperately trying to secure free healthcare for those same Illegals. That’s been a serious drain on their polling. It has left them with the appearance of being pro-immigrant, but anti-American citizen, and in turn, wondering why the Citizens don't like them much. \n\nOur own Catherine Salgado suggested, “When a Democrat opens his mouth, you can be pretty sure he or she is about to lie — especially when it comes to immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers.”\n\nWell, not all of them, but enough to set the trend. However, some Democrats, seeing just how disconnected from the voters they have become, have been trying to allow common sense into their rhetoric, for example, the Laken Riley Act. Even that proved to be dangerous to the Democrats. Only 58 of the 215 House Dems voted for it. The situation surrounding the Laken Riley Act has proven to be a winner for the GOP, and the Democrats know it.\n\nRecent polling points to around half of American adults holding increasing security at the border in one form or another to be their highest priority. Trouble is, the Democrats cannot acknowledge this without admitting they’ve blown the whole immigration deal. So they’re stuck halfway, not admitting that being in the country illegally is a crime, and one that hurts the American economy, but claiming to want to remove those illegals with what they call serious criminal records. Are the Democrats completely unable to build a consensus within the party? There's no way out of the trap they've constructed for themselves, no way to save any face at all.\n\nOf a kind with this conflict is the fight against the cartels. The Democrats are apparently comfortable calling it the “war on drugs,” but they raise hell when facts confront them with Donald Trump acting as if it actually is the war it always should have been. That’s a mixed message which serves their immediate interests of chanting “Orange Man Bad” once again, but doesn’t mesh well with trying to convince American voters that they take their responsibility to protect America seriously.\n\nThe Democrats, as usual, are acting not out of conviction about what is best for America, but what is the most advantageous position, politically. The consequences to the Democrats on all this have yet to be played out, but we should not ignore the impact on the midterms. The rabid defense of their unpopular policies is not doing them any good with the voters.\n\nThe thing is that there's no way out for them in the short term, without admitting they were wrong. That may be the hardest task. I suspect they'd rather lose elections than take the blame for their misguided policies. Admitting their own fault is something they've never done in my memory, and I doubt that's going to change before the midterms. Even if they did that, would anyone believe them?\n\nHonest journalism, honest opinion, and straight-up analysis. That's what you support when you subscribe VIP-style to PJ Media.
