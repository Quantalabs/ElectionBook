Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., scolded what he called the \"overly online left\" for attacking Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro over his Jewish faith and support for Israel. Shapiro, who is considered to be a top contender to be Kamala Harris' running mate, was forced to defend his stance on Israel after an op-ed he penned more than three decades ago resurfaced over the weekend. His support for Israel has been controversial inside the Democratic Party due to the strong anti-Israel views of the party's far-left flank. Those who oppose his candidacy launched the \"No Genocide Josh\" campaign and continue to pressure Harris to pick another running mate. In an appearance on CNN Monday, Auchincloss rebuked the far-left wing of his party for applying a different standard to Shapiro than they have to other vice presidential contenders, arguing that there is a \"strong undercurrent of antisemitism\" to their attacks. VP SHORT-LISTER SHAPIRO ON DEFENSE OVER ISRAEL AFTER DECADES-OLD COLLEGE PAPER SURFACES COMIC MICHAEL RAPAPORT SAYS HARRIS LOST HIS VOTE OVER ISRAEL: ‘CAN’T SUPPORT PARTY THAT IS FOR THIS BULLS---\" \"Those in the overly online left who are attacking Josh Shapiro's pro-Israel positions in a different way than they are attacking non-Jewish veep contenders' positions, they're just telling on themselves,\" Auchincloss, who is Jewish, said on \"CNN This Morning.\" \"There is a strong undercurrent of antisemitism to that,\" he continued. \"It's unacceptable. Every contender's positions on all policy issues, their track records in elected office, all of that is fair game. That is totally open to be subjected to interrogation and to questioning by the Harris team, by observers, but holding him to a different standard because of his religion just simply isn't who we are in the Democratic Party.\" Auchincloss isn't the only Jewish congressional Democrat who has said that criticism of Shapiro is unfair and assumes that Jewish politicians cannot be objective on Israel. Rep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio told Axios, \"I think there is that sense that somehow we're not objective [on Israel] because we're Jewish, which is just not true or fair. There are a lot of members who are pro-Israel who have been protested against — I think as Jews it feels particularly intense and personal.\" HARRIS' VETTING TEAM PRIVATELY MEETS WITH SHAPIRO, KELLY AHEAD OF VEEP ANNOUNCEMENT: REPORT The op-ed, written by Shapiro as a 20-year-old college student, detailed his time volunteering on an IDF base in high school and included his belief that \"Palestinians will not peacefully coexist,\" because \"they do not have the capabilities to establish their own homelands and make it successful even with the aid of Israel and the United States.\" Shapiro’s spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital in a statement, \"Since he wrote this piece as a 20-year-old student, Gov. Shapiro has built close, meaningful, informative relationships with many Muslim-American, Arab-American, Palestinian Christian, and Jewish community leaders all across Pennsylvania. \"The Governor greatly values their perspectives and the experiences he has learned from over the years – and as a result, as with many issues, his views on the Middle East have evolved into the position he holds today,\" Bonder continued. Bonder pushed back on the idea that the newspaper op-ed, written decades ago, provides any indication of the governor’s current thinking regarding Israel. \"As the Governor has made clear for years, he supports a two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians can live together peacefully – and he believes it is critical for leaders on both sides of this conflict to take meaningful, necessary steps towards a lasting peace,\" Bonder stressed. \"Governor Shapiro has worked hard to bring people together, listen, and keep our communities safe and heard – and he will always be a Governor for all Pennsylvanians,\" Bonder added. Shapiro took a fierce stance against antisemitism following the October 7 massacre which sparked campus protests nationwide. When members of the Philly Palestine Coalition protested outside Israeli-owned businesses in December, Shapiro admonished them for what he called a \"blatant act of antisemitism- not a peaceful protest. \"This hate and bigotry is reminiscent of a dark time in history,\" he wrote on X at the time. He also supported Israel's right to defend itself while acknowledging the increasing death toll in Gaza.\" \"We can’t forget the genesis of this, but we also can’t ignore the death and the destruction that’s occurred in Gaza,\" he told the Washington Post in March. He also demanded the removal of a student encampment at the University of Pennsylvania and supported a bill that would financially discipline colleges for boycotting or divesting from Israel, WHYY reported.

The man, as confirmed by Colquitt County Coroner C. Verlyn Brock, lost his life at a home in Moultrie, a city located approximately 40 miles (64 kilometers) northwest of Valdosta, Georgia. This report was covered by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The storm has damaged roofs and downed power lines in Moultrie, Police Chief Chad Castleberry told WALB-TV. Debby, classified as a tropical storm by the National Hurricane Center, had maximum winds of about 45 mph (75 kph) by Monday evening as it made a slow northeastern progression. Its projected path included traversing southeastern Georgia and gradually slowing down to an eastward trajectory. Charleston, South Carolina, announces curfew, roads into historic city to be closed Charleston, South Carolina, officials announced a curfew starting at 11 p.m. Monday for the peninsula that makes up much of downtown and the older parts of the 350-year-old city as some of the heaviest rain from Tropical Storm Debby is expected to fall overnight. Police will barricade all eight roads leading into the peninsula and only let essential workers and emergency personnel in or out. High-water vehicles will also be staged to go into the area as needed, Charleston Mayor William Cogswell said at a Monday evening news conference. “We need people to make their way out. This is not something you can stay at the bar until 10:45. We need you to take this seriously,” Cogswell said. The mayor said forecasters told him 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain could fall in Charleston overnight. City officials will assess the situation early Tuesday and decide how and when to reopen roads and lift the curfew. No evacuations planned for now in South Carolina, officials say State officials don’t plan any evacuations in South Carolina for now as Tropical Storm Debby slowly spins toward the state. Large-scale evacuations typically bring people inland from the coast, and forecasters say Debby’s biggest impacts could be as much as 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain in localized areas throughout the state, causing floodwaters to rise quickly in small areas. So any evacuations will up to local leaders. “This storm may not have the high winds of a hurricane, but it has the potential to cause life-threatening floods across the state. And I would like to emphasize that Tropical Storm Debby is not just a coastal event, but it is a statewide event,” state Emergency Management Division Director Kim Stenson said at a Monday afternoon news conference. Biden approves request from South Carolina’s governor for emergency declaration The White House said Monday that President Joe Biden has approved a request from South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster for an emergency declaration, following his earlier approval of a similar request from Florida. In a statement, the White House said personnel from the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Coast Guard are deploying to the region and are prepared to support recovery efforts. North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper declared a state of emergency Monday ahead of Debby’s anticipated rainfall. Flooding and power outages are expected to start Tuesday and continue through the rest of the week, according to North Carolina Emergency Management officials. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis previously had declared a state of emergency for 61 of Florida’s 67 counties, with the National Guard activating 3,000 guard members. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp also had made his own emergency declaration. Curfew announced for Savannah and surrounding county as Debby approaches With Debby’s winds and rains expected to worsen overnight, officials for Savannah and surrounding Chatham County announced that an overnight curfew will take effect at 10 p.m. Monday and run to 6 a.m. Tuesday. The National Hurricane Center says the region can expect rains that could exceed 20 inches (51 centimeters). By Monday afternoon, the storm’s outer bands were lashing Tybee Island, home to Georgia’s largest public beach, blowing sheets of rain sideways and rattling street signs near the beach pier. The island of 3,100 residents east of Savannah was bracing for a potential double-dose of flooding from an expected 2 to 4 feet of storm surge on top of rainfall. “This is unprecedented rainfall,” said Michelle Owens, Tybee Island’s interim city manager. She added: “We don’t know what that looks like. So we have to be prepared for the worst. But we are definitely hoping for the best.” Public works crews used earthmoving equipment to heap sand over beach access points to help fortify a storm surge buffer offered by surrounding dunes. Owens said the city also had given out about 2,000 sandbags to island residents. Angela Thompson had several sandbags ready by the front door of her ground-level apartment near Tybee Creek on the island’s west side. She had just started moving in earlier this week and hoped to ride out the storm while unpacking. “I have food and water and batteries and the things that I need, and I’m going to stay as long as I can,” Thompson said. Florida will be on alert for flooding for the next week, Gov. Ron DeSantis says Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that just because Tropical Storm Debby is moving toward Georgia, that doesn’t mean the state won’t continue to see threats as waterways north of the border fill up and flow south. “It is a very saturating, wet storm,” DeSantis said during a briefing at the state’s emergency operations center. “When they crest and the water that’s going to come down from Georgia, it’s just something that we’re going to be on alert for not just throughout today, but for the next week.” Record-setting rain was forecast to cause flash flooding in coastal Georgia and South Carolina and into North Carolina, with up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rainfall in some areas, according to the National Hurricane Center. Debby made landfall early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane over Florida’s gulf coast. The storm was moving slowly to the north-northeast and was expected to slow down as it turns to the east. No deaths or injuries in Florida county where Debby made landfall, sheriff says The sheriff of Florida’s Taylor County, where Debby came ashore as a hurricane Monday, says there are no deaths or injuries in the sparsely populated area located in the state’s northern Big Bend region. But Sheriff Wayne Padgett advised anyone who had evacuated from low-lying and coastal areas to wait before returning because the tide will be coming in and it’s unknown how deep the water might get. Several roads are closed due to flooding as well as trees and power lines downed by the storm, Padgett said. Debby made landfall as a category 1 hurricane near Steinhatchee, a tiny community of less than 1,000 residents. Mayor warns tourists, residents on South Carolina’s Hilton Head Island: Don’t let your guard down No evacuations were planned Monday on South Carolina’s Hilton Head Island, one of the state’s most popular beach destinations. But Mayor Alan Perry warned tourists and residents not to let their guard down with forecasts predicting up to 30 inches (76 centimeters) of rain this week from Debby. “We don’t know how much rain is going to fall. But we have to prepare for the worst,” Perry said. “If that happens, we will see an event we have never seen on Hilton Head before.” In a video posted on Facebook, Perry asked island residents and visitors to check on each other before the heavy rain starts — and maybe help the city out by checking storm drains. “If you are able to go out and pull some debris from those drains so they can drain, that’s is really key to preventing additional flooding,” he said. Hilton Head Island has about 38,000 residents. Officials estimate up to 250,000 tourists can be on the island on the busiest summer days. In saturated Savannah, residents prepare for potentially historic rains As Debby threatened to dump potentially historic flooding rains across southeast Georgia, more than 20 people in Savannah filled sandbags at a park in the city’s suburban southside. Rain soaked their clothes and mud stuck to their shoes. Officials are especially concerned about Debby because the area already is saturated after Savannah recorded 8.5 inches of rain in July, 3 inches greater than normal, according to the National Weather Service. Jim Froncak tossed a dozen full bags into the back of his pickup truck while his son and a friend did the shoveling. Even though his home sits about 2 feet off the ground, Froncak said he won’t be surprised if a nearby ditch overflows with floodwaters capable of reaching his doors. “A really heavy thunderstorm will fill it up,” Froncak said. “So whatever’s coming is really going to fill it up and flow over.” City crews spent days ahead of Debby’s arrival clearing storm drains throughout Savannah. Some low-lying neighborhoods outside the historic downtown area had flooded streets from thunderstorms less than two weeks ago. Packages containing cocaine wash up on beach in Florida Keys during storm, Border Patrol says In the Florida Keys, Debby blew packages containing 70 pounds (32 kilograms) of cocaine onto a beach, the U.S. Border Patrol’s Miami sector reported Monday. A “good Samaritan” found the drugs and contacted authorities, the agency said. The cocaine has a street value of more than $1 million, the agency said on social media. It’s didn’t say exactly where the cocaine was found. Vice President Harris postpones trip to Georgia Vice President Kamala Harris is postponing a scheduled trip to Georgia amid the ongoing effects of Tropical Storm Debby. Harris’ campaign said her stop planned in Savannah, Georgia, on Thursday, was being put off due to the storm. Harris is choosing her running mate and will introduce the choice during a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday. The pair will then travel together starting on Wednesday to a series of key battleground states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Arizona and Nevada. But the Georgia leg of the original journey has been canceled for now. Debby made landfall in Florida on Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and was expected to bring potentially record-setting rainfall to Georgia and South Carolina as it heads east. Debby forces flight cancellations at Florida airports More than 1,600 flights were canceled nationwide by midday Monday, many of them to and from Florida airports, according to FlightAware.com. One out of every five flights scheduled to leave Orlando International Airport was canceled Monday, with just as many incoming flights canceled there. Nearly 30 percent of flights scheduled to depart Tampa International Airport on Monday were canceled. High numbers of canceled flights were also reported at airports in Jacksonville and Fort Myers. Biden briefed on Debby’s progress President Joe Biden was briefed on Debby’s progress while at his home in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said Monday. The White House said Biden on Saturday approved Florida’s request for an emergency declaration and that federal rescue personnel, meals and water have been deployed to the storm-stricken region. The administration is closely monitoring the storm and response effort with state and local officials, it said. A 13-year-old boy dies when tree falls on mobile home in Florida, and officials report other deaths in storm A 13-year-old boy died Monday morning after a tree fell on a mobile home located southwest of Gainesville, Florida, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office. Officials reported other deaths as Debby moved inland. A truck driver died early Monday on Interstate 75 in the Tampa area after he lost control of his tractor trailer, which flipped over a concrete wall and dangled over water before the cab dropped into the water below. East of Steinhatchee, a tiny community in northern Florida near where the storm made landfall, a 38-year-old woman and a 12-year-old boy were killed late Sunday when the car she was driving on a wet road struck a median and then overturned off the road. A 14-year-old boy who was a passenger was hospitalized with serious injuries, according to the Florida Highway Patrol. Debby weakens to a tropical storm but flooding threat continues Debby has weakened into a tropical storm with top winds hovering around 45 mph (75 kph) Monday evening. The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the storm was moving slowly to the northeast. It was expected to cross southeastern Georgia and to slow to a crawl as it turns to the east. Debby made landfall as a hurricane in the Big Bend region of Florida, one of the state’s least populated areas. Forecasters are still warning that heavy rain could spawn catastrophic flooding in Florida, South Carolina and Georgia. Substantial rainfall was expected as well in central and northeast North Carolina through Wednesday morning. Big worry is storm surge from Debby Forecasters said storm surge was expected to be the biggest threat for Florida, with 6 to 10 feet (1.8 to 3 meters) of inundation above ground level predicted in part of the zone near the Big Bend. “That part of the coast is a very vulnerable spot,” John Cangialosi, a hurricane specialist with the National Hurricane Center, said Monday. Some areas, including Sarasota and Manatee counties, have already received 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) of rain. In Georgia, the National Weather Service is predicting major flooding on some rivers: the Canoochee River near Claxton, the Ohoopee River near Reidsville and the Ogeechee River near Eden. All those rivers were below flood stage Monday but could see their water levels more than double by later in the week. Hundreds of thousands without power More than 300,000 customers were without power in Florida and Georgia on Monday afternoon, down from a peak of more than 350,000, according to PowerOutage.us and Georgia Electric Membership Corp. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said some 17,000 linemen are working to restore electricity. He warned residents in affected areas to sit tight until conditions are safe. “When the water rises, when you have streets that can be flooded, that’s hazardous,” DeSantis said. “Don’t try to drive through this. We don’t want to see traffic fatalities adding up. Don’t tempt fate, don’t try to go through these flooded streets.” —- This version corrects the attribution for power outage figures to PowerOutage.us, not PowerOutage.com.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHere&#8217;s the Latest: Man killed when storm topples large tree onto home&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Debby Accused of Causing Multiple Deaths in Florida and Georgia, Resulting in Power Outages for Thousands first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/debby-accused-of-causing-multiple-deaths-in-florida-and-georgia-resulting-in-power-outages-for-thousands/","image":"https://www.news4jax.com/resizer/v2/JKEJUK4Y3NB3FATZB2ZNXK7UBA.jpg?auth=442f79b9eed5954264bf0955964a350447322ba39d1cdb511d04fa03e035ccbb","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-06 00:31:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.071},{"id":253454790,"title":"US vows full-court press to help Israel ahead of attack by Iran","text":"The Biden administration is preparing for an Iranian attack on Israel in the coming hours or days. President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed by the national security team on Monday afternoon about the “threats posed by Iran and its proxies to Israel and to U.S. servicemembers in the region,” the White House press office said in a statement. It’s unclear how exactly Iran intends to attack Israel, but it has vowed to after last week’s assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran while he was there to celebrate the Iranian president’s inauguration. The administration has vowed to aid Israel in defending against an attack from Iran or its proxies, and the United States has troops in Jordan, Iraq, and Syria, which have come under attack in recent months by Iranian proxy militias in the latter two countries. In preparation, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered the USS Abraham Lincoln Carrier Strike Group to replace the USS Theodore Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group, additional ballistic missile defense-capable cruisers and destroyers to the Europe and Middle Eastern area, the deployment of an additional fighter squadron to the Middle East, and an increase in readiness to deploy additional land-based ballistic missile defense. U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Michael Erik Kurilla is in Israel meeting with his counterparts there. Biden spoke with King Abdullah II of Jordan to discuss efforts “to de-escalate regional tensions.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken urged every party in the Middle East not to escalate the current conflict further during public remarks with Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong. “We are engaged in intense diplomacy pretty much around the clock, with a very simple message: All parties must refrain from escalation. All parties must take steps to ease tensions. Escalation is not in anyone’s interests. It will only lead to more conflict, more violence, more insecurity,” he said. “It is urgent that all parties make the right choices in the hours and days ahead.” All of Iran’s proxies — Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and militias in Iraq and Syria — have carried out attacks against U.S. military personnel or Israel since Hamas’s Oct. 7 attack. Israel carried out a strike on an Iranian consulate in Syria on April 1 that killed a senior Iranian commander and other senior Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps members. The Iranians waited a couple of days and then launched an unprecedented number of rockets, missiles, and drones at Israel from its own territory, a rarity, and had its proxies also launch their own projectiles at Israel. The Israelis, with the help of several allies including the U.S., were able to intercept nearly all of the projectiles, significantly limiting the damage. U.S. forces at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq were attacked on Monday, and there were reportedly casualties. “The President and Vice President were briefed on the attack at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq,” the White House readout said. “They discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing.” U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have come under rocket or missile attack more than 170 times since the attacks began in the weeks following Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attack in Israel that resulted in the deaths of roughly 1,200 people. In late January, the militias killed three U.S. troops at Tower 22, a small U.S. base in northeast Jordan, which prompted a strong U.S. military response, and the attacks largely stopped after that. Israel also assassinated a senior Hezbollah commander, whom the Israelis said was responsible for a prior rocket attack that killed a dozen teenagers on a soccer field in the Golan Heights days before the Haniyeh assassination. Israel and Hezbollah have engaged in cross-border attacks — mainly missiles, rocket, or drone attacks — since the immediate aftermath of Hamas’s Oct. 7 attacks. The cross-border attacks have forced tens of thousands of civilians to evacuate their homes on both sides of the border. Experts warn that if Israel and Hezbollah were to have an all-out war, it would be extremely destructive and deadly for both sides even though they believe Israel would likely end the conflict ahead.","summary":"The Biden administration is preparing for an Iranian attack on Israel in the coming hours or days.

When they are down, it is all because [of] the Democrats and how horrific they are.” On Monday, Trump did just that, singling out Vice President Kamala Harris’ rapid ascent to the top of the Democratic presidential ticket as the reason for Monday’s drop. “Of course there is a massive market downturn. Kamala is even worse than Crooked Joe.

On Fox, Cavuto also noted that several large daily declines in stock value occurred during Trump’s administration. “Some of our biggest point falloffs—three of the biggest of the top ten—occurred during his administration.

According to a report on Israeli outlet, Channel 12, yesterday, Prime Minister Netanyahu decided to postpone his aims to establish relations with Saudi Arabia due to the rapid developments taking place within US politics in recent months, particularly in regard to US President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from the presidential race and the increasing likelihood of former president, Donald Trump’s re-election into power in the elections in November. Netanyahu’s view is reportedly that it may be worth waiting until the end of the US election season to see whether the Republican nominee, Trump, returns to office, in which case the Israelis would apparently have a clearer vision in regards to the process of pursuing the long-sought normalisation deal with the Gulf Kingdom under US mediation. READ: Rekindling the old love affair: Can Trump save Netanyahu? The reported decision by Netanyahu comes as US Congress has been finishing up its summer session ahead of and in preparation for the election in November, apparently giving the postponement more weight. It also comes, however, around a week after an Israeli official assured reporters at a briefing in Washington that a normalisation agreement between Tel Aviv and Riyadh was still possible before the presidential election, and that Netanyahu had discussed the issue with President Biden during their White House meeting.

While tangible outcomes of the trip were more pronounced in East Asia, experts said key allies in Southeast Asia were strategically prioritised. Tan See Seng, research adviser at the Singapore-based S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies (RSIS), said Blinken’s choice to visit the Philippines, Singapore and Vietnam – all countries previously visited by US Vice-President Kamala Harris – was a continuation of President Joe Biden’s “emphasis on practical bilateral ties, rather than multilateral diplomacy with Asean”. “His priority remains strengthening bilateral ties with selected Southeast Asia states that the US deems important to its strategy to counter China,” Tan said. Blinken’s visit from July 25 to August 3 also took him to Laos, Mongolia and Japan. Most of the concrete outcomes occurred during his time in Tokyo. During the Japan-US Security Consultative Committee, known as the “2+2” security talks on July 28, Washington and Tokyo agreed to further bolster military cooperation by upgrading the command and control of American forces in the East Asian country. A day later at the Quad Ministerial Meeting, Blinken met foreign ministers from Australia, India and Japan, with the bloc saying in a statement after the meeting that they were working on a series of initiatives to maintain a “free and open maritime order”, including a plan to set up a new maritime legal dialogue. In Southeast Asia, Blinken paid his respects to Vietnam Communist Party chief Nguyen Phu Trong, who died on July 19, while in Laos he attended the Asean Regional Forum where he criticised Beijing’s “escalating and unlawful actions” in the South China Sea. In Singapore, Blinken said at a dialogue that the US would remain engaged with the world regardless who became president in the November election, and defended Washington’s trade policies against China as part of a plan to ensure fair competition and protect national security. The only deliverable in Southeast Asia was during Blinken’s visit to the Philippines, where Washington announced US$500 million in foreign military financing to help modernise the Southeast Asian nation’s armed forces. Tan of RSIS said Asian leaders would have wanted Blinken to speak on how the US intended to counter China, and how that policy would affect the region. “Apart from China, Asian leaders would have pushed him to say how the US will continue to engage with the rest of Asia as a good in itself,” Tan said, adding that Blinken could have touched on what a potential Harris administration might mean for the region. While there are strong indications that former president Donald Trump might return to the White House after November’s election, Harris, who secured the Democratic presidential nomination last Friday, is expected to pose a consideration challenge to Trump. Should Harris become president, Tan said it would be worth paying attention to her current Deputy National Security Adviser Rebecca Lissner, whose ideas on the need for America to “de-risk” itself from China “could inform Harris’ China policy”. Lissner’s ideas on the need to keep the global commons free, open and accessible are also worth looking into, according to Tan, alongside her views on the importance of the US as rule-setter rather than rule-taker. Mark S. Cogan, associate professor of peace and conflict studies at Japan’s Kansai Gaidai University, said it was in Laos that Blinken expressed his criticism over China’s “destabilising actions” in the South China Sea. “The location of which is strategic as there is an urgency among neighbouring states on how to manage China’s aggressive presence in their own backyard,” Cogan said. Blinken’s visit as a whole was also “to move Southeast Asian partners closer towards a more assertive or proactive posture towards China in the South China Sea”, Cogan noted. “The not-so-subtle message to Vietnam was that American resolve in the region is in line with Hanoi’s recent diplomatic complaints about the Hai Yang research vessel,” he said, referring to the Chinese vessel sailing around Vietnam’s exclusive economic zone in June. Noting that what was made public versus what was discussed in private were often two different things, Cogan said it was likely that continuity of foreign policy was also on the agenda. “I am sure that the US had circulated the message that Harris’ defiant rebuke of China during her Singapore trip a few years ago would be central to policy going forward,” Cogan said. During a week-long visit through Southeast Asia in 2021, Harris delivered a sharp rebuke in Singapore of China for its incursions in the South China Sea, warning that Beijing’s actions amounted to “coercion” and “intimidation”, and affirming that Washington would support its allies in the region. “This trip is not just about military aid or a contrast with China,” Cogan said, noting that it was also about foreign policy continuity. “Southeast Asian partners are unsurprisingly nervous about a Trump second term, and the transactional diplomacy and accommodation that defined his previous four years in office. That is consequential for Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, which have a history of policy flexibility.” Chong Ja Ian, an associate professor in political science at the National University of Singapore, said much of Southeast Asia appeared to be “ambivalent, confused, or even contradictory” about what they wanted from the US. “They do not want to see a lack of US commitment, yet they also worry when [Washington] shows active engagement,” Chong said, adding that most Southeast Asian states also liked to criticise Washington for intensifying US-China competition. “The rivalry is bilateral, [but] there is little corresponding criticism of [China]. Perhaps such behaviour is simply because it is easy and cheap to criticise Washington and not have to worry about costs, in contrast to Beijing,” Chong added.","summary":"Trip seen as continuity of US foreign policy, but analysts say more insight needed into engagement with rest of Asia ‘as a good in itself’.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3273304/blinkens-asia-trip-boost-bilateral-ties-reinforces-stance-south-china-sea-row-analysts","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/08/05/44391ee3-6dfb-4cd9-9904-8d22ec1e923a_eabafcaa.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/31/Alexandre%20Soljenitsyne_5_0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-06 00:00:10","author":"Maria Siow","authors":["Maria Siow"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.169},{"id":253453726,"title":"Project 2025 Is an Unmitigated Polling Disaster for Trump and Republicans","text":"Across the Democratic Party’s most senior levels — within Vice President Kamala Harris 2024 campaign, the Democratic National Committee, and other leading party elections and messaging operations — liberal operatives and politicians are plotting to make sure that between now and Election Day, as many voters as possible know about Project 2025, as well as Donald Trump, J.D. Vance, and Republican leaders’ deep connections to it. With just three months left in the U.S. presidential election, various sectors of the Democratic elite are planning to invest considerable resources toward amplifying the hard-right, Heritage Foundation-hosted policy and personnel initiative, in order to damage the Trump-Vance ticket and other GOP candidates, especially in battleground states, according to four people with knowledge of these operations. In the words of one source familiar with Team Harris’ efforts on the matter, Democratic leaders are working to “smother” Republican candidates “with their own vision for the country,” and will be spending significant time and money — on targeted ads and other messaging and fundraising blitzes — to further solidify Project 2025 in the consciousness of the American electorate. Recent public polling underscores why the Democratic Party is so enthusiastic about tying Republicans to Project 2025: The data suggest that many of the policy priorities outlined in its agenda are deeply unpopular. Furthermore, according to a person familiar with the matter and another Democrat briefed on it, there are reams of internal polling among Democratic organizations showing how much Project 2025 has been breaking through the media ecosystems, even to many median voters. Numerous Democratic Party sources, including some lawmakers on Capitol Hill, independently tell Rolling Stone that they were stunned that Project 2025 actually broke through to a surprising number of normal, non-extremely-online Americans, and can’t believe how often they have been asked about it by constituents and other so-called “normies.” Indeed, there is some public data, such as from YouGov earlier this summer, pointing to how information on Project 2025 had started to emerge from closed-off partisan bubbles. “Overall, 20 percent of U.S. adult citizens say they’ve heard a lot about Project 2025, while 39 percent have heard a little and 42 percent have heard nothing at all,” the YouGov report reads. “Most Independents with an opinion about Project 2025 dislike it (7 percent favorable, 38 percent unfavorable), while Republicans are more positive (26 percent favorable, 12 percent unfavorable).” This all explains why Trump and his senior staff have — falsely — claimed that he has nothing to do with the conservative project, to the point that he got his supporters to boo Project 2025 during a campaign stop. Trump and his ilk realize how much attention the project is receiving from voters and how woefully unpopular many of the outlined policy prescriptions are to the average citizen. In recent weeks, as Rolling Stone previously reported, Trump had privately vented to political advisers that Project 2025, specifically the abortion-related components of it, risked tanking his electoral chances ahead of November. The former Trump administration staffer, Paul Dans, who headed up Project 2025 within the Heritage Foundation recently resigned, after trying to claim that Trump had no ties to it. Last week, Trump’s campaign co-chiefs Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita gloated in a statement: “Reports of Project 2025’s demise would be greatly welcomed and should serve as notice to anyone or any group trying to misrepresent their influence with President Trump and his campaign — it will not end well for you.” Project 2025 has not shuttered. Even if it had, its large policy book has long since been published, its Trumpy personnel database has already been built, and the numerous conservative organizations — including the Heritage Foundation — that formed Project 2025 still exist and are still doing the work (some of which is blessed by Trump himself) to lay the foundation for a potential second Trump term. “Trump can try to distance himself from this, but 70 to 80 percent of the people who wrote the book are going to be in his second administration — the cabinet, under secretaries, assistant secretaries, the senior advisers. They’re all going to be the foot soldiers in a second Trump administration!” one of Project 2025’s contributors previously said. “You can’t look at this constellation of organizations and people without seeing that they’re all his people.” Recent polling from Navigator — a consortium of liberal pollsters, organizations, and operatives — found that some of Project 2025’s abortion-related proposals test off-the-charts poorly. Nearly 80 percent of registered voters oppose allowing the government to monitor people’s pregnancies to potentially prosecute them if they miscarry, 73 percent say it would be harmful to allow employers to deny workers access to birth control, 70 percent say a national abortion ban would be harmful, and 71 percent say it would be harmful to ban in-vitro fertilization nationwide. But it’s not just abortion. Other Project 2025 proposals also test through the floor, when posed to likely voters and focus groups. The Navigator poll found 82 percent of voters say it would be harmful to remove the Affordable Care Act’s protections for Americans with preexisting conditions; 79 oppose banning Medicare from negotiating lower drug prices and removing the $35 price cap on insulin for seniors; 73 percent oppose abolishing the Department of Education; 66 percent of voters oppose allowing the president to fire thousands of federal civil servants and replace them loyalists; 68 percent of voters oppose making it easier to discriminate against LGBTQ+ people. “Our campaign will ensure Americans understand how harmful Trump’s Project 2025 is to their lives, including cutting billions in education funding, monitoring women’s pregnancies, raising prescription drug prices on seniors, and gutting our government of nonpartisan officials to install Trump loyalists as dangerous as they are unpopular,” James Singer, a Harris 2024 spokesperson, says on Monday. Similarly, the Democratic National Committee’s national press secretary, Emilia Rowland, says: “Trump and Vance’s Project 2025 agenda should terrify every American: banning abortion nationwide, threatening doctors with jail time, restricting access to contraception, and even monitoring women’s pregnancies,” adding that this “November, voters will remind Trump and Vance that they have no place in our doctor’s offices.” The Navigator findings are backed up by new polling from University of Massachusetts Amherst gauging respondents’ opinions on Project 2025 policy priorities. The UMass poll results, provided exclusively to Rolling Stone, found that 68 percent of Americans oppose the idea of firing thousands of federal employees and replacing them with political appointees loyal to the president, 64 oppose eliminating the Department of Education, and 72 percent oppose restricting women’s access to contraception. The poll additionally found that 56 percent of Americans oppose cutting funding for renewable energy research and investment, and only 23 percent who support doing so. And a majority of respondents said they oppose reducing federal protections for LGBTQ+ Americans, compared to 22 who support doing so. According to the UMass poll, 53 percent of Americans have read, seen, or heard about Project 2025. “Our results suggest that Trump’s move away from Project 2025, while straining credulity, makes sense if Trump intends to return to the White House,” says Tatishe Nteta, the UMass Poll director. “While our politics are usually divided by class, generational, racial, gender, and partisan identities, among these groups we find almost universal opposition to many of the policies associated with Project 2025.” Nteta continues, rather ominously for the American right’s 2024 ambitions: “Even former Trump voters exhibit opposition to many of these policies, a bad omen for the Republican Party and Trump campaign.”","summary":"Democrats are planning to “smother” Donald Trump, J.D.

A poll of more than 3,000 voters by CBS and YouGov released Sunday showed Harris up by the barest of margins, but doing dramatically better than her boss had been before he decided to back away from presidential consideration. “She has a 1-point edge nationally — something President Biden never had (he was down by 5 points when he left the race) — and Harris and former President Donald Trump are tied across the collective battleground states,” CBS wrote. That small lead, according to Trump’s campaign, was the result of some funny math by pollsters and not reflective of reality. “The latest CBS / YouGov poll of registered voters nationwide showing margin-of-error shifts in the national head-to-head ballot between President Trump and Kamala Harris is entirely the result of a methodological decision allowing ideology to change significantly, while maintaining weights on age, partisanship, and race to make the survey appear not to have been manipulated,” Trump’s campaign said Monday. According to Trump’s campaign, the polls sampling make up is also problematic. Of 3,092 registered voters contacted, only 35.5% identified themselves as conservatives, compared to 30.3% moderate voters and 30.2% liberal leaners. That’s fewer conservatives and moderates than seen in past polls, they say, and unfairly skewed to the left. “Without this manipulation, President Trump would be maintaining a 51-49 lead in their August 4 survey,” the Trump’s team said. Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior advisor, said the polls demonstrate that the “fake news media” is continuing its crusade to “help dangerously liberal Kamala hide her record of economic failure and soft on crime policies.” “As this analysis shows they’ll even put a finger on the scale of polling to inflate results for her. This analysis is why the American people are seeing through it and will not allow this national gaslighting campaign to win,” Hughes said. But despite the skepticism cast by team Trump, a slew of polls released Monday show similar results. A survey of 1,326 registered voters conducted by I&I/TIPP shows Harris up by one point in a head-to-head matchup and by two points in a race including third party alternatives, both within the 2.9-point margin of error. A SurveyUSA poll of 1,500 likely voters found the Vice President leading the 45th President by three points — outside the 2.4% margin of error — with 4% of those surveyed reporting they are still undecided. A Morning Consult poll of 11,265 registered voters released on Monday has Harris up by 4%, well outside that weekly survey’s 1% margin of error. “Harris leads Trump, 48% to 44%, a record-high margin in her favor in our tracking and the largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year,” pollsters wrote.","summary":"“Harris leads Trump, 48% to 44%, a record-high margin in her favor in our tracking and the largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year,” Morning Consult wrote","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/05/trump-team-cries-foul-over-sunday-poll-but-surveys-out-monday-show-same-or-worse/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/AP24210622885334-1-1.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:42:09","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.522},{"id":253455106,"title":"Several US Personnel Injured In Rocket Attack On Iraq Base","text":"A rocket attack on a base in Iraq wounded multiple US personnel on Monday, officials said, adding to already heightened regional tensions over an expected Iranian counterattack on Israel. The rocket fire is the latest in a series of attacks targeting Ain al-Assad base in western Iraq, which hosts American troops as well as personnel from the US-led coalition against the Islamic State jihadist group. \"There was a suspected rocket attack today against US and coalition forces\" at the base, a US defense spokesperson said. \"Initial indications are that several US personnel were injured.\" \"Base personnel are conducting a post-attack damage assessment\" and updates will be provided as more information becomes available, the spokesperson added. US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed on the attack, the White House said. \"They discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing,\" it said in a statement. An Iraqi military source had earlier said that multiple rockets were fired at the base, with some landing inside it and another hitting a nearby village but not causing damage. A commander in a pro-Iran armed group told AFP that at least two rockets targeted the base, without saying who had carried out the attack. Another source in the group and a security source confirmed an attack occurred. Such attacks were frequent early in the war between Israel and Hamas Palestinian militants in Gaza but since then have largely halted. The latest rocket fire comes as fears grow of an attack by Iran and its allies on Israel in retaliation for the killing of top Hamas and Hezbollah figures in strikes last week either blamed on or claimed by Israel. - Series of attacks -The killings, with both Iran and Hezbollah vowing retaliation, are among the most serious series of tit-for-tat attacks that have heightened fears of a regional conflagration stemming from the Gaza war. The Iran-aligned \"Axis of Resistance\" against Israel, which also includes Iraqi groups and Yemen's Huthis, have already been drawn into the nearly 10-month war. Monday's rocket attack occurred after US forces carried out a strike last week on combatants who were attempting to launch drones that were deemed a threat to American and allied troops, a US official said. The strike, which Iraqi sources said left four killed, was the first by American forces in Iraq since February. There have been two recent attacks targeting bases hosting US and allied forces in Iraq -- on July 16 and 25. Prior to that, US troops in Iraq and Syria had not been targeted since April. But attacks against them were much more common in the first few months of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, when they were targeted more than 175 times. The Islamic Resistance in Iraq, a loose alliance of pro-Iran groups, claimed the majority of the attacks, saying they were in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. In January, a drone strike blamed on those groups killed three US soldiers at a base in Jordan. In retaliation, US forces launched dozens of strikes against Tehran-backed fighters in Iraq and Syria.

The power couple has been together for almost ten years, but according to Harris' stepchildren, who adore her and call her 'Momala', they are 'still in the honeymoon phase' of their relationship. In an exclusive interview with The New York Times in 2021, Ella Emhoff and Cole Emhoff gave insight into their blissful marriage, \"It depends on the setting. Because Doug and Kamala together are like almost vomit-inducingly cute and coupley. I’m like, When is this going to wear off? It’s so insane. It’s like the honeymoon phase forever. Like, the rest of the world gets to see it on social media, but we live that,\" they revealed. Ella further elaborated that it was overwhelming to experience Harris' political position: \"When we went to see them for Election Day, it really hit me, like, Whoa. Seeing them is a lot different now. There’s a lot more people. I think the idea of sharing our parents with the world is kind of insane. Like, it’s a really cool thing to wrap your head around — because you get to share all the great things — but it’s also like, Huh?!\" As per Elle, Harris discussed in a 2019 Mother's Day piece that a significant role in her life was stepparenting Cole and Ella. \"As a child of divorce, I knew how hard it could be when your parents start to date other people. And I was determined not to insert myself in their lives until Doug and I had established we were in this for the long haul,\" she wrote in the lengthy heartfelt essay. The Democratic presidential nominee went on to reveal the moment she was given the famous moniker, \"A few years later when Doug and I got married, Cole, Ella, and I agreed that we didn’t like the term “stepmom.” Instead, they came up with the name 'Momala.'\" While concluding, Harris quoted Senator Maggie Hassan' words of wisdom. “Our kids love us for who we are and the sacrifices we make,” she said. “They get it.” Harris' husband, an attorney by profession, posted a congratulatory video for his wife on her presidential nomination. Emhoff has stood with Harris for most of her illustrious political career and currently backing her bid for the White House. “There has been life breathed into the Democratic campaign for president and they do not have one minute to waste or lose. And so you are going to put out your biggest guns on this – and he is just important a surrogate as anyone,” Anita McBride, Emhoff's spokesperson told CNN. Spokesperson Seth Schuster added that Doug “will be a vigorous and active campaigner, speaking directly to our coalition about the issues they care most about and mobilizing the voters who will decide this election to ensure that Vice President Harris becomes President Harris.”","summary":"&#34;I was determined not to insert myself in their lives until Doug and I had established we were in this for the long haul,&#34; Harris said on parenting.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/why-doug-emhoffs-kids-believe-his-relationship-with-kamala-harris-is-almost-vomit-inducing","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/709092/uploads/895fab00-531d-11ef-9152-bda98b7b594a_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:30:01","author":"INQUISITR,Mary Anthony","authors":["INQUISITR","Mary Anthony"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.374},{"id":253454510,"title":"Virginia man charged with threatening Vice President Harris","text":"WASHINGTON >> A Virginia man was charged with making violent online threats against Vice President Kamala Harris days after she began her U.S. presidential campaign.

Tim Walz could be Kamala Harris’ running mate. What happens if he becomes vice president?","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is one of Vice President Kamala Harris’ top picks for a presidential running mate, and a decision is expected by Tuesday. Harris has narrowed down her list to two or three candidates, according to national media reports, with the vice president meeting with finalists over the weekend. Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly, of Arizona, met with Harris on Sunday, the Washington Post and others reported. Walz would bring his liberal record as governor, experience in Congress as well as small-town Midwestern credentials and his background as a school teacher and his military service to the ticket. And in recent weeks he’s gained national media attention for going on the attack against Republicans by calling them “weird,” a tactic that’s gained traction among Democrats trying to convince swing voters to come to their side. What if Walz is picked? The odds look decent that Minnesota’s governor will join the Democratic presidential ticket. So if he does, what happens next? Should Walz run with Harris, he will continue serving as governor through the presidential election. But if Harris defeats former President Donald Trump in November, Walz will have to step down. If that happens, Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would become governor of Minnesota for the rest of Walz’s second four-year term, which ends in January 2027. She would be the first woman and first Native American to hold the state’s highest elected office. Even if Walz doesn’t get picked as vice president, he’s widely seen as a favorite for a cabinet position in a future Democratic administration. If Harris wins the 2024 presidential election, Walz could end up leaving the governor’s office if he’s asked to lead an executive agency like the Department of Education or Veterans Affairs. The last Minnesota to serve as vice president was Walter Mondale in President Jimmy Carter’s administration. Before that Hubert Humphrey served with President Lyndon B. Johnson. Who fills Flanagan’s seat? With the lieutenant governor’s office open, the Minnesota Constitution calls for the “presiding officer” of the Senate to fill the position. If that were to happen right now, it would mean Senate President Bobby Joe Champion, a Minneapolis DFLer, would fill the role. He would become Minnesota’s first Black lieutenant governor. The Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party currently splits control of the Senate 33-33 with Republicans after the June resignation of State Sen. Kelly Morrison, DFL-Deephaven, who is running for Minnesota’s 3rd Congressional District. However, the Legislature isn’t scheduled to convene until January. There’s a special election for Morrison’s Senate seat in November on the same day as the general election that will determine who controls the majority in the Minnesota Senate. The rest of the Minnesota Senate isn’t up for election until 2026. If Champion were to become lieutenant governor and step down from the senate, there would also be a special election for his seat. Democrats likely would regain control as his north Minneapolis district is a safe Democratic stronghold. Though past transitions haven’t gone quite as smoothly. Lt. Gov. Michelle Fischbach In January 2018, then-Gov. Mark Dayton appointed Lt. Gov. Tina Smith to fill former U.S. Sen. Al Franken’s seat after Franken resigned amid a sexual harassment scandal. The move automatically made Republican Senate President Michelle Fischbach the lieutenant governor. Fischbach refused to resign from the Senate as it would have ended a slim Republican majority in the chamber. That prompted lawsuits from DFLers, who alleged holding two offices at once violated the state Constitution. Fischbach refused to take the oath of her new office, and instead called herself “acting lieutenant governor.” But she resigned from the Senate in May following the 2018 legislative session.","summary":"Walz would bring his liberal record as governor, experience in Congress as well as small-town Midwestern credentials and his background as a school teacher and his military service to the ticket.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/08/05/gov-tim-walz-could-be-kamala-harris-running-mate-what-happens-if-he-becomes-vice-president/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/STP-L-KAMALA-0723-001.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:29:17","author":"Alex Derosier","authors":["Alex Derosier"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.026},{"id":253452582,"title":"US Stock Market Tumbles as Donald Trump, Kamala Harris Campaign Tangle","text":"Anxiety over a potential slowdown in the U.S. economy intensified on Monday as Wall Street and international exchanges saw sharp declines, sparking reactions from the 2024 presidential election candidates.Global shares began collapsing at the end of last week when investors grew alarmed at the prospect of a U.S. recession. A U.S. Labor Department report released on Friday showed American employers added 114,000 jobs, a significant drop from the 179,000 in June.On Monday, the global market plunge struck the U.S., as American stocks fell sharply after opening as the Dow Jones index plummeted more than 1,030 points, or 2.6 percent. Warnings have emerged that tech giants like Apple and Nvidia might be overvalued. On Friday, the Nasdaq composite entered a correction phase, marking a 10 percent decline from its recent high and continued to drop by an additional 3.4 percent on Monday.This arrives among concerns that the Federal Reserve may have held its key interest rate too high for too long, heightening the risk of a U.S. recession, reported the Associated Press (AP).Economists and Wall Street traders are now predicting that the Fed will cut its benchmark rate, which influences borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, much sooner than expected. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has repeatedly emphasized that the central bank can quickly lower rates if necessary to support the economy, according to the AP.Despite recurring fears of an impending recession, these predictions have consistently proven wrong in the post-pandemic economy. Steady economic growth and robust hiring have endured against most analysts' expectations, the news outlet added.This comes as the 2024 presidential election is fast approaching, as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are expected to face off in November.In wake of the market news, Trump blamed Harris, taking aim at her in a video posted to his Truth Social account, sharing a video and captioning it \"Kamala Krash.\"Trump previously took credit for record highs under President Joe Biden's leadership.Newsweek reached out to the campaigns of Trump and Harris via email for comment on Monday.A Harris campaign account, Kamala HQ, posted to X, formerly Twitter, a clip of Trump from a rally in which he says: \"If Biden wins, you're gonna have a stock market collapse the likes of which you've never had.\"It is followed by a separate image of a post made by Trump on Truth Social that says: \"THIS IS THE TRUMP STOCK MARKET.\"The Biden campaign post reads: \"Right: Trump in 2020 claiming the stock market will collapse if President Biden wins.

Four years later, if Harris selects Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Eche could be looking at a payday. He is willing to sell it — and a slate of over a dozen other Harris websites — for $15,000, he says. This is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in New York City’s Brooklyn borough. Eche is a cyber squatter, a person who buys a domain with someone else’s name or brand for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. It is also called domain investing, given it can reap significant rewards. In 2011, five years before Hillary Clinton selected Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine to be her running mate in the presidential race, Eche — then known as Jeremy Peter Green, before he got married — purchased ClintonKaine.com. After the former secretary of state made the pick, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with “Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc” emblazoned at the bottom. Harris spent the weekend interviewing a half dozen potential running mates, including Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, according to two people with knowledge of Harris’ selection process. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private campaign deliberations. She is said to be making her decision imminently and has a slate of planned events with her running mate this week. Eche told the AP that he has not been contacted by anyone connected to the Harris campaign. In 2016, it took a week after Clinton selected Kaine before he connected with anyone from the Clinton campaign, and that was because he had a connection to the operation. He is skeptical Harris’ campaign will reach out before they officially make the pick. “Hopefully (Harris’) people are a little more savvy than Clinton’s people were,” he said. Eche owns at least 15 websites tied to Harris and her selection of a possible running mate. In addition to Walz, he also owns HarrisPritzker.com, a nod to the Illinois governor; HarrisEvers.com, for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers; HarrisFetterman.com, for Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman; HarrisWarnock.com, for Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock; HarrisPeters.com, for Michigan Sen. Gary Peters; and several others. But Eche does have a favorite among her prospective veeps. “Walz is my favorite,” he said. “Of the people she is thinking about, Walz makes the most sense.” He also owns 10 websites featuring Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s name and other Democrats, with an eye toward a possible 2028 presidential run. Eche’s Walz website is now simply a blank chartreuse with the governor’s name in lower-case black letters, a callback to the artist Charli XCX labeling Harris “brat” in a tweet shortly after President Joe Biden ended his campaign, allowing the vice president to take on his operation. That was his wife’s idea, he said. But the site links to his startup’s website — Communer, a site to buy and sell domains and trademarks — where he is offering the Harris slate for $15,000. Eche supported Clinton in 2016, and he supports Harris this cycle. Yet his experience from 2016 — where his website turned into a pro-Trump site — doesn’t give him any pause in selling the Harris sites this time around. “The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don’t buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,” he said. “I’ve got to sell it to somebody. I know I could just donate it, but that is not really how this works. People with billboards aren’t donating their billboards to the campaign. It is just a property basically.” A Harris spokesperson did not immediately respond when asked whether the plan to buy the domains.","summary":"After Hillary Clinton's campaign declined to buy the website with her name on it in 2016, the owner sold it to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/05/kamala-harris-tim-walz-cyber-squatter-pritzker-fetterman-evers-squatter/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2164176005-e1722900227543.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:26:28","author":"Dan Merica,The Associated Press","authors":["Dan Merica","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.197},{"id":253453212,"title":"A Virginia man is charged with online threats against Vice President Kamala Harris","text":"A Virginia man has been arrested and charged with threatening online to kill Vice President Kamala Harris and harm other public officials. Frank L. Carillo, 66, of Winchester, made an initial appearance Monday in federal court and is being held pending a detention hearing scheduled for Thursday, according to court records and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. According to an FBI affidavit, agents in Phoenix began investigating after online threats were made against a Maricopa County official on a social media website called GETTR. Agents found that an account under the name “joemadarats1” had made numerous threats against politicians, including Harris and President Joe Biden. In late July, after Biden dropped his reelection bid and Harris emerged as Democrats’ likely nominee, the account issued numerous threats against the vice president. In one, the author wrote “Harris is going to regret ever trying to become president because if that ever happened I will personally pluck out her eyes with a pair of pliers but first I will shoot and kill everyone that gets in my way.” The FBI traced the account to Carillo’s residence in Winchester. The FBI searched his home on Friday and Carillo told officers that if the search was “about the online stuff. I posted it,” according to the affidavit. He later stated incredulously, “This is all over a comment, huh?” Agents seized a military-style rifle and a handgun from the home. “Open political discourse is a cornerstone of our American experience. We can disagree. We can argue and we can debate. However, when those disagreements cross the line to threats of violence, law enforcement must step in,” United States Attorney Christopher R.

Frank L. Carillo, 66, of Winchester, made an initial appearance Monday in federal court and is being held pending a detention hearing scheduled for Thursday, according to court records and the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Virginia, which is prosecuting the case. According to an FBI affidavit, agents in Phoenix began investigating after online threats were made against a Maricopa County official on a social media website called GETTR. Agents found that an account under the name “joemadarats1” had made numerous threats against politicians, including Harris and President Joe Biden. In late July, after Biden dropped his reelection bid and Harris emerged as Democrats’ likely nominee, the account issued numerous threats against the vice president. In one, the author wrote “Harris is going to regret ever trying to become president because if that ever happened I will personally pluck out her eyes with a pair of pliers but first I will shoot and kill everyone that gets in my way.” The FBI traced the account to Carillo’s residence in Winchester. The FBI searched his home on Friday and Carillo told officers that if the search was “about the online stuff. I posted it,” according to the affidavit. He later stated incredulously, “This is all over a comment, huh?” Agents seized a military-style rifle and a handgun from the home. “Open political discourse is a cornerstone of our American experience. We can disagree. We can argue and we can debate. However, when those disagreements cross the line to threats of violence, law enforcement must step in,” United States Attorney Christopher R.

Josh Shapiro — but not all of them want Kamala Harris to make him her vice presidential pick. Cumberland County couple Candice and David Tritle said they’re happy with their gov where he is, and don’t want Pennsylvania to lose Shapiro to Pennsylvania Avenue. “We think he’s a great governor and we’d hate to lose him,” Candice Tritle told The Post, adding that both she and David support Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly as Harris’ running mate. Shapiro elicited strong reactions from young voters like Faith Keyser, who moved to Pennsylvania from California to attend college. “I watch the news, I hear his name come up, and I’m like, ‘That’s my governor! Right on,” she said, adding that Shapiro isn’t her first choice for Harris’ second-in-command. She’d rather see Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. “I’m a big fan of Pete and his work,” Keyser said. Shapiro, 51, is broadly popular in Pennsylvania, but his views on school choice and the Israel-Hamas war have alienated him from many on the left — including the founders of the “No Genocide Josh” campaign, which seeks to discredit the governor for his support of Israel. Defenders of Shapiro, who is Jewish, say many of the attacks against him are rooted in antisemitism, as other VP short-listers have not been subjected to the same scrutiny for their support of Israel. “For some reason, @JoshShapiroPA’s support is problematic to certain leftists,” Minnesota congressman and Biden primary rival Dean Phillips posted last week on X/Twitter. “Such anti-semitism cannot be granted safe haven in any party. Period,” Phillips added. Shapiro’s office has also been hit with a sexual harassment scandal, prompting Pennsylvania Treasurer nominee Erin McClelland to float North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper for VP, before he removed himself from consideration. Never one to fall in line, Sen. John Fetterman (D-Pa.) reportedly “warned” Harris about the extent of Shapiro’s presidential ambitions — concerns other detractors have shared as well.","summary":"A lot of Democrats in Pennsylvania are big fans of Gov.

However, his office’s recent effort to intercede regarding the New York criminal case brought by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg against former President Donald Trump has met with rejection. On July 3, Bailey’s office filed a motion for leave to file a “bill of complaint” against the State of New York in the United States Supreme Court. In the motion, Missouri sought a temporary stay of the gag order and sentencing in Trump’s case in the run-up to the election. As set forth in the accompanying brief and complaint, the actions by New York have created constitutional harms that threaten to infringe the rights of Missouri’s voters and electors, namely:New York’s gag order and impending sentence unlawfully impede the ability ofelectors to fulfill their federal functions.New York’s gag order and impending sentence violate the Purcell principle.New York’s gag order and impending sentence violate the First Amendment rights of Missouri citizens to listen to the campaign speech of a specific individual on specific topics.Missouri respectfully submits that the forgoing violations establish considerable harms to voters and electors in Missouri, who will be precluded from fully engaging with and hearing from a major-party Presidential candidate in the run up to the November election. These harms are a direct consequence of New York’s calculated, unprecedented decision to prosecute Trump for alleged bookkeeping offenses just months before the Presidential election. On Monday, however, the Supreme Court issued an order denying Missouri’s motion. The order is obviously brief, simply denying the relief requested by the State of Missouri, but does indicate that Justices Thomas and Alito would have granted the motion to file the bill of complaint. As CNN notes, the effort was somewhat of a longshot. But the case was widely viewed as unlikely to gain traction at the Supreme Court in part because of the sweeping implications of allowing a state to intervene in a pending criminal case unfolding in a different state. Following the ruling, Bailey issued a statement on Twitter/X, expressing his disappointment with the outcome but vowing to continue efforts to combat Joe Biden’s (and Kamala Harris’s) Department of Justice: It’s disappointing that the Supreme Court refused to exercise its constitutional responsibility to resolve state v. state disputes.I will continue to prosecute our lawsuit against @KamalaHarris @JoeBiden’s DOJ for coordinating the illicit prosecutions against President Trump— Attorney General Andrew Bailey (@AGAndrewBailey) August 5, 2024","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMissouri Attorney General Andrew Bailey (R) has waged several successful legal efforts&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Supreme Court&#8217;s Decision on Missouri Case to Lift Gag Order and Sentence in Trump NY Lawsuit first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/supreme-courts-decision-on-missouri-case-to-lift-gag-order-and-sentence-in-trump-ny-lawsuit/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Supreme-Court-Rules-on-Missouri-Suit-Aimed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:23:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.03},{"id":253452400,"title":"RFK Jr’s despicable dead bear story has officially turned him into ‘Sideshow Bob’","text":"Brain worms and goats and bears, oh my! It’s just another day in the wild, wild Robert F. Kennedy Jr. presidential campaign, which has done absolutely nothing to further the scion’s political ambitions. But it has provided a revealing look into Sideshow Bob’s dynastic eccentricity and entitlement, with a menagerie of critters as the supporting cast. Kennedy’s bid as an Independent has included a worm that ate his brain, a barbecued animal carcass , and video of him doing shirtless push-ups — in jeans. And then there was a press dinner last July, at which the environmental lawyer was meant to acquaint himself with reporters. Instead, host Doug Dechert stole the show when, Page Six reported, he “let rip a loud, prolonged fart” while yelling “I’m farting!” How auspicious. How dignified. What a way to follow in RFK Sr.’s footsteps. And now the latest: Kennedy’s confession to Roseanne Barr that he left a dead baby bear in Central Park a decade ago. (You getting all this?) The admission ended a long-running urban mystery that, when the cub was first discovered in 2014, was widely covered in the media. That includes a story by a New York Times reporter named Tatiana Schlossberg — the daughter of Kennedy’s first cousin Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg. It’s hard to decide which detail is the weirdest. That Kennedy was on a falconry excursion in the Hudson Valley when a car in front of him ran over the bear? That he put the dead cub in his van “because I was going to skin the bear and it was very good condition and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator”? That he posed for a photo with the dead, bloodied animal, jokily sticking his hand in its toothy grip? That he forgot he was on his way to Peter Luger for dinner, and then to the airport? That he decided to dump the bear in Central Park — and stage it with his bicycle, as if a cyclist had hit a bear in Central Park and fled the scene? (“Bears are not going to go through a city,” a skeptical bear expert told The Times in 2014.) Or maybe what he told his Barr, his confessor: “My prints were all over that bike.” Where was CSI? Kennedy was getting ahead of the story, which the New Yorker cracked. But this makes you wonder: What other cold cases is he connected to? Hoffa? The Zodiac killer? Should we ask him some questions about Lola the red-tailed hawk? Don’t forget, this comes on the heels of a Vanity Fair piece just last month, with a photo of Kennedy about to bite down on skeletal animal carcass, which they suggested was in Korea. Vanity Fair quoted a veterinarian who said it sure looked like a dog. “Of course it’s not a dog … it’s a goat in Patagonia,” RFK Jr. told Chris Cuomo. “There’s two things I wouldn’t eat — well, three,” he added. “I wouldn’t eat a human, I wouldn’t eat a monkey, and I wouldn’t eat a dog.“ Bears, on the other hand … And then there’s the brain worm. In May, it was reported that, during a deposition in 2012, Kennedy said doctors believed an abnormality on his brain “was caused by a worm that got into my brain and ate of a portion of it and then died.” In any other campaign year, this guy is all we’d be talking about. But we all have whiplash from the main event, what with the worst presidential debate ever, an assassination attempt on Trump, an infirm Biden dropping out or the race and the ascension of Kamala Harris, who is suddenly queen of the coconut tree because of “vibes.” The crazy vibes coming from the RFK Jr. camp are strong. They’re saying, Kennedy curse — but make it zoological! Emerging from the Covid era, RFK Jr. was branded a conspiracy theorist because of his views on vaccines and mandates. He had been disavowed by his famous family, something that continues to this today. At the time, no one would touch him. Too controversial. In 2022, he sat down with Megyn Kelly for a two-part interview that Kelly’s team rigorously fact-checked, and it broke the ice. I found him both offputting and intriguing: a product of the Democratic machine, he was willing to befriend people on both sides of the aisle. But the more he’s talked — and the deeper the media has dug — the crazier the stories have become. Who needs oppo research when Kennedy is so willing to shoot himself in the foot? Still, if you’d like a souvenir for the Camelot resurrection that won’t be, his and running mate Nicole Shanahan’s campaign was reportedly selling “Kennedy-Shanahan 2024” teddy bears. Something to remember his noble pursuit.","summary":"It's just another day in the wild, wild Robert F.

The livestream was hosted on Kick and, at its peak, had over 580,000 viewers. Ross is a streamer known for courting controversy. At the height of his popularity on Twitch, he accumulated over 7 million followers. He’s hosted influencer Andrew Tate, who is currently facing charges in Romania for rape and human trafficking. He was repeatedly banned from Twitch for using racial slurs, before being permanently banned last year after featuring a chat stream where users spammed racial and antisemitic slurs. Ross migrated to the alternative streaming site Kick, where continued his antics which included hosting known white supremacist Nick Fuentes. Ross’ terms-of-service-breaking content, like streaming the Super Bowl and scrolling through PornHub, has made him popular with Gen-Z males and thereby a perfect conduit for Trump to reach a younger audience — something his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, is herself attempting by hosting rallies featuring rapper Megan Thee Stallion. The stream with Trump may drive just as much controversy. At one point in the interview, Ross presented Trump with Rolex watch. Shortly after gifting him the watch, Ross brought up Fani Willis, a district attorney in the state of Georgia, who has filed an indictment against Trump for alleged election interference during the 2020 presidential election. “I have a friend who’s currently being treated very unfair by [District Attorney Willis]. He’s a rapper named Young Thug,” Ross said during the livestream, referencing Williams’ racketeering case against the rapper. “I was just wondering if there’s a way that we could make sure he gets treated fair?” \"Observers wondered if Ross was attempting to bribe Trump.\" Donald Trump has a precedent for getting rappers out of sticky legal situations. At the end of his term in 2021, Trump pardoned the rapper Lil Wayne after he pled guilty to illegal gun possession. He also commuted the sentence for rapper Kodak Black, who was sentenced to 46 months after lying on federal forms in an attempt to purchase firearms. Trump didn’t directly respond to Ross’ question, saying, “He’s gotta be treated fair.” As the details of the stream spread across social media, observers wondered if Ross was attempting to bribe Trump or whether accepting such an expensive gift constituted some kind of campaign finance violation. The two continued the livestream with Trump offering one word comments on a list of celebrities and politicians, including Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky. Finally, at the end of the stream, Ross presented Trump with another gift: a Tesla Cybertruck with a custom wrap featuring the now famous picture of Trump after he was shot at during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. The stream ended with Ross and Trump streaming from the Cybertruck as “YMCA” played them out.","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/5/24214007/trump-adin-ross-livestream-kick-2024-presidential-election","image":"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s4bt1IfJDgIAcDRnTmPc9leDh-k=/0x0:2182x1142/1200x628/filters:focal(1091x571:1092x572)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/25560887/Screenshot_2024_08_05_at_6.03.58_PM.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 23:17:57","author":"Ash Parrish","authors":["Ash Parrish"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.027},{"id":253452068,"title":"Kamala Harris Hits Record Lead Over Trump, New Poll Shows","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris earned Democrats their highest lead over former President Donald Trump in nearly a year, according to a poll from Morning Consult.The pollster released its latest survey on the 2024 election on Monday, which found Harris leading Trump 48 percent to 44 percent among registered voters across the country. Morning Consult said the poll was conducted between August 2 and 4 and is based on the responses of 11,265 voters.Morning Consult said that Harris' 4-point lead is a \"record-high margin in her favor\" and is the \"largest advantage for a Democratic presidential candidate over Trump in nearly a year,\" according to the pollster's election tracking.On August 16, 2023, President Joe Biden was found to be ahead of Trump by 5 points among national voters surveyed by Morning Consult. The day before Biden dropped out of the 2024 race, the pollster found him to be 6 points behind the former president (47 percent to 41 percent).Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee, also leads Trump by 5 points among independent voters (42 percent to 37 percent) in Monday's poll and was beating the former president by 9 points among young voters between the ages of 18 and 34 (49 percent to 40 percent).

The left’s electoral strategy is predicated on riling up voters with ever-more divisive and destructive ideas. The strategy is risky and perhaps even self-defeating, yet Harris is rushing in that direction. She will likely run the most radical campaign in modern history. And Trump shouldn’t let her get away with it. I’ve spent 30 years conducting and analyzing polls, and like many in my profession, I’ve concluded that the single most important political development of the 21st century is the migration of white voters to the Republican Party. The GOP can now count on the consistent support of about 60% of white voters, if not more — up from about 50% to 55% previously. And while demographic changes are slowly lowering whites’ share of the electorate, they still represent about ⅔ of all American voters — meaning Democrats must maintain a strong coalition based on non-white voters to prevail. The Democratic coalition that emerged in Barack Obama’s election in 2008 and remains today centers on four groups: blacks, Hispanics, single women and young voters between the ages of 18 and 29. Since 2008, Republican presidential candidates have never won more than 37% of any of these groups and usually performed much worse, according to Roper Center data. To win in 2024, Harris must claim Obama-like levels of support among them all, since her party’s erosion among white voters means she’s unlikely to gain the 41% of the white vote that Biden did in 2020. The challenge is to appeal to each part of her coalition. Since Obama’s victories, the Democratic Party strategy has been to play to each group’s identity, striking often divisive notes to drive turnout. They’ve met black voters with messaging about America’s widespread racism, while Hispanics have heard a similar negative message. Democrats reach single women with warnings about sexism and abortion and young voters with a variety of cultural and economic catnip, from marijuana legalization to climate virtue-signaling. The problem with this strategy is that with every election, Democrats have had to push the envelope to keep the coalition together — especially after Hillary Clinton failed to do so in 2016. Hence the left’s radicalization over the past eight years: its current hostility to the police, belief in open borders, support for childhood sex changes and demands for rampant student debt cancellation. Far from a platform based on principles, the Democratic Party’s agenda is impelled by a desperate attempt to keep its coalition energized. The job of grievance-peddling now falls to Harris, and she’s already tacking further left. Notably, she has immediately backed more student debt cancellation and has stridently defended an expansive approach to abortion access as a means of appealing to young and single women. Perhaps the only moderation she’s shown is her quiet announcement that she no longer wants an immediate ban on fracking — a calculated retreat designed to help her in Pennsylvania. As the campaign progresses, Harris will likely move into more radical territory, potentially, for example, resurfacing her past support for reparations for the descendants of slaves. Will Donald Trump be similarly extreme? Not even close. Trump’s rhetoric is a major departure from political norms, with its heavy emphasis on personal attacks. But policy-wise, the former president isn’t driving voters to the polls on the crazy train. He generally talks about supporting the police, expanding opportunity, cutting taxes and the federal bureaucracy, standing with the military and other run-of-the-mill Republican priorities. Trump’s relative policy normalcy — combined with Democrats’ increasing ideological extremism — is already drawing new voters to the Republican fold. Polls consistently show him doing better with blacks and Hispanics compared to 2020 and 2016, likely because a growing number are fed up with the left’s agenda and its resulting record of failure. Perhaps most crucially, young men have begun a mass migration rightward, threatening a key part of the Democratic coalition. These defections are already driving Harris’ turn toward radical identity politics: Instead of trying to win lost voters back, she’s revving up those who remain, hoping they’ll turn out in massive numbers. The result is a great American tragedy. One of our country’s two great parties has decided it can’t win without pitting people against each other and undermining core constitutional, economic and moral principles. The other party projects a unifying message of opportunity and aspiration — behind a standard-bearer who resists appeals to the country’s better angels. But it’s a message Harris must oppose at all costs for her strategy to work.

Border patrol has encountered as many as 250 during that time period, including from places with an active terrorist presence like Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Somalia, Pakistan, Turkey, Somalia, Uzbekistan, Mauritania and Yemen. The report, put out by the House Judiciary Committee, found that tens of thousands of nationals from countries that could present national security risks had been encountered, including 2,134 Afghans, 33,347 Chinese, 541 Iranians. 520 Syrians and 3,104 Uzbeks. The report cited information provided to the committee staff from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in June. ‘That does not include the untold numbers of potential terrorists that evaded Border Patrol to enter the United States as part of nearly 2 million ‘gotaways’ since the beginning of the Biden-Harris Administration,’ the report went on. In June eight Tajikistan nationals with potential ties to ISIS were arrested in New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles in a coordinated sting by law enforcement. The FBI’s joint terrorism task force ‘began monitoring the eight as part of an investigation into ‘a potential terrorist threat originating in central Europe.’ Three of them had entered the U.S. after booking asylum appointments on the CBP One phone application, three had been encountered by Border Patrol while crossing the border and another arrived at a part without scheduling an asylum appointment. Republicans have issued dire warnings about about the threat potential of an overwhelmed border that can’t be counted on to keep would-be terrorists out. Biden has insisted it would take an act of Congress to secure the nation’s border. The U.S. has encountered 1.8 million crossings in fiscal year 2024 through June. Numbers ticked down to 130,000 in June from a record high of 301,000 in December. Conservatives insist he has the executive power to do so – and allowed a bipartisan immigration bill to die out earlier this year over concerns it did not go far enough. Also in June it was revealed that US agents are racing to round up over 400 immigrants who were smuggled into the U.S. through the border by an ISIS-affiliated human smuggling network from Central Asia and are considered ‘subjects of concern.’ The migrants crossed the southern border, and although they were vetted by US Border Patrol during entry, they could not be detained at the time since they were not on the government’s terrorism watchlist, according to NBC News. At the time the story broke, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) had already arrested 150 of the 400 migrants. However, the location of 50 of them was totally unknown to US authorities. The over 400 migrants are believed to be from Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Moldova, Kyrgyzstan, Georgia and Russia.

The US-backed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty journalist had been detained in October 2023 and found guilty of spreading false information about the Russian army – charges her family and employer deny. Kurmasheva and her husband, Pavel Butorin, have two daughters, including one who turned 13 just minutes after reuniting with her mother. Asked by Tapper what it was like to learn she would be released, Kurmasheva said she didn’t believe she was free until “the very end.” “It wasn’t until I saw my family that I believed that I’m free. Or, I would say when I was on a US airplane that I really believed that something like magic I was hoping for months was happening,” she continued. The sweeping deal involved 24 detainees in total and was the result of years of complicated behind-the-scenes negotiations involving the US, Russia, Belarus and Germany, ultimately leading Berlin to agree to Moscow’s key demand – releasing convicted Russian assassin Vadim Krasikov. Hostage affairs official: Biden admin has made ‘hard decisions’ The top US hostage affairs official addressed criticism that Russia may be more likely to take US hostages for leverage if the White House continues to approve prisoner swaps, telling Tapper earlier in the program that the Biden administration had to assume some risk in order to bring the Americans hostages home. “You always assume a risk in these situations, and the president has been willing to make these hard decisions,” Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs Roger Carstens said. Carstens, who was also involved in the high-profile releases of former Marine Trevor Reed and WNBA star Brittney Griner from Russian detention, has served as the US’ top hostage negotiator since 2020. The diplomat told Tapper that he once had 54 hostage cases that are “now down to just over 20.” “So we’ve made hard changes. We’ve traded some bad people to get good people, innocent people back,” Carstens said. “And you would think that my numbers would be skyrocketing up and yet they’re not. They’re going in the opposite direction. So the math proves that assertion to be wrong,” he continued. “When we make these hard decisions and the president makes the tough call to send someone back in a trade like this, our numbers are actually going down.” Sen. Lindsey Graham suggested on Fox News on Sunday that the deal has increased Putin’s leverage on the West, saying there is a “cycle” that incentivizes the Kremlin to detain Americans on “trumped up charges” so they can exchange them for “Russian spies and killers.” The South Carolina Republican said that the “cycle needs to stop.” Asked Monday whether President Joe Biden plans to contact the family of Marc Fogel, a US teacher in Russian prison who was not included in the swap, Carstens said that he can’t speak for Biden and has called on the Russians to release Fogel on humanitarian grounds. Though Fogel has not been designated as “wrongfully detained” by the Biden administration, the US has brought back people that have not had the designation before, Carstens explained. “Just because someone’s not necessarily designated wrongful doesn’t mean that we’re not also trying to work behind the scenes to bring them home as well,” he said.

Parlor talk is rampant over the three men rumored to be in the veepstakes' top tier: Govs. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and Tim Walz of Minnesota and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly. The search's calculus likely takes into account their varying appeals, backgrounds, personal baggage and where on the electoral map they can improve Harris' standing. But it's unclear exactly how much a running mate helps the candidate at the top of the ticket -- and the downside of picking someone not ready for the bright lights of a national campaign are severe, possibly making the lack of negatives superior to any possible positives a contender brings. \"At the end of the day, the most practical thing is, do no harm,\" said former Sen. Doug Jones, D-Ala., a Harris ally. \"Who's the governor of which state? Who's the senator from, what state? What do they bring? There's all this public record about the other factors that you would include.

Those in contention to be Harris' pick have been auditioning for days, appearing across various media outlets, singing the vice president's praises and going after former President Donald Trump and Sen. JD Vance his running mate. Last weekend, some were interviewed in person at Harris' residence in Washington. Of Shapiro, Walz and Kelly, each brings his own benefits. Shapiro is a rising star and popular governor of the nation's marquee swing state. Walz brings a progressive record and the folksy appeal of a white-haired Midwesterner, along with an extensive record in Washington, the military and public education. Kelly boasts a sterling resume as a combat veteran and former astronaut from a swing state who is married to a survivor of political violence. Each, too, brings vulnerabilities. Shapiro has drawn progressive ire over his stances on Israel, school vouchers and handling of a sexual misconduct claim against a staffer in his gubernatorial office. Walz risks exacerbating attacks on Harris as a \"California liberal\" with his own policy record. And Kelly isn't known to exactly deliver a barnburner on the stump. Democrats insist they're happy with their choices, arguing that any of the top-tier candidates would be positive additions to Harris' ticket. \"The stakes are very high. But fortunately for us, all three of her finalists are superstars and would do well by us,\" said Democratic strategist David Brand, who works with members of Harris' team and said he supports Shapiro in his personal capacity. Still, various factors will be weighed, and downsides will be measured against upsides. \"There does seem to be a little bit of baggage around him, but again, I think that's all trumped by the very possibility, if she does pick him, that he can help lock down Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes. That's not insignificant,\" one Democratic pollster said, using Shapiro as an example. Harris \"has one priority when it comes to this campaign, and it's winning the election,\" the person added. \"She's gonna let that filter and that calculus be the only calculus in her mind when she decides who to pick. And you can rest assured that who she picks, she chose because she thought that that person helped her win the election. Nothing else.\" Typically, running mates haven't moved the electoral needle significantly in a positive way, and many have enjoyed a burst of attention after their announcements before becoming largely minor factors in recent heavyweight presidential bouts. One source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking said a running mate has the potential to alter the race -- either by adding a benefit and complementing Harris or faceplanting, and that their potential to change the race is often underestimated. But traditionally, the person said, voters decide how to cast their ballot based on the top of the ticket. \"I think a VP can be a drag. I believe they can also provide a bump. And as is typically the case, they can have not much of an impact at all,\" the person said. The downside a running mate could bring, however, could be steep. Democratic strategists pointed to former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as a cautionary tale. Palin, a once-rising star in the GOP, was tapped as then-Sen. John McCain's running mate in 2008. After initially injecting his presidential campaign with a shot of youthful enthusiasm, she faltered on the national stage when her lack of policy chops was laid bare. Her pick as his running mate has since been credited in part with McCain's loss to Barack Obama -- and Democrats are wary of a similar result, with the source familiar with the Harris campaign's thinking saying a similar stumble would be \"problematic.\" \"I think a bad pick can weigh down that ticket,\" Jones added. \"And given where we are in this country right now, a bad pick doesn't have to weigh down a ticket much in order to affect an outcome in a critical state. It could be two or three percentage points. It could be 10,000 votes or 20,000 votes.\" The high stakes of the decision has Democrats operating behind the scenes to persuade Harris on who is the best -- and safest -- pick. Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., is reportedly pushing against Shapiro, a longtime personal rival. And donors are chiming in with their own suggestions. The backbiting has frustrated some Democrats, including Jones, who said such feuds should be dealt with in private and out of the eyes of the press and the public. Others, though, are less concerned. \"Are they going to all jump over to support Trump tomorrow?\" Brand sarcastically asked. \"This always happens.

Social media platforms, including X have been under scrutiny for years over the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories, including false information about elections and vaccines. There has been growing concern in Washington that AI-generated content could mislead voters in the November presidential and congressional elections. Since Musk bought the platform formerly called Twitter in 2022, civil rights groups have raised concerns over a rise in hate speech and misinformation due to reduced content moderation. Musk, who last month endorsed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, himself has been accused of spreading misinformation. For example, he has said, without evidence, that Democrats are allowing migrants to cross the southern border so that they can vote in federal elections, even though they are ineligible to do so. “As Secretaries of State whose offices and 37 million constituents were recently impacted by false information provided by your platform, we are calling on you to immediately implement changes to X’s AI search assistant, Grok, to ensure voters have accurate information in this critical election year,” the officials from Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Washington, Michigan and New Mexico said in an open letter to Musk. After Democratic US President Joe Biden stepped aside as presidential candidate on July 21 and endorsed Vice-President Kamala Harris, the chatbot, Grok, falsely told social media users that Harris had missed the ballot deadline in nine states. “This is false. In all nine states the opposite is true,” the letter from the secretaries of state added. Musk said in March that Grok – a chatbot from artificial intelligence start-up xAI – would be enabled for all premium subscribers of X. The officials said in their letter that even though the chatbot is only available to premium users, its misinformation was shared with millions of people on social media. The officials said X should direct Grok users to CanIVote.org, a non-partisan website on US voting information, when asked about US elections. The social media platform did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. X, which researchers say has scaled back content moderation efforts and reinstated once-banned accounts of known misinformation spreaders, has also faced criticism for stoking tensions during recent far-right riots across England. On Sunday, Musk triggered fresh criticism for posting that “civil war is inevitable” in response to another user blaming the riots on “the effects of mass migration and open borders”.

He’s sitting on HarrisWalz.com now","text":"Jeremy Green Eche took a chance and purchased the website HarrisWalz.com for $8.99 in 2020 when then-Sen. Kamala Harris of California was seeking the Democratic nomination for president. “I just tried to grab her name and all the heartland governors I could think of,” he recalled Monday in an interview with The Associated Press. Four years later, if Harris selects Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Eche could be looking at a payday. He is willing to sell it — and a slate of over a dozen other Harris websites — for $15,000, he says. This is not a new scenario for the 36-year-old trademark lawyer in New York City’s Brooklyn borough. Eche is a cyber squatter, a person who buys a domain with someone else’s name or brand for very little money, hoping to sell it to that person or brand for a large profit in the subsequent months or years. It is also called domain investing, given it can reap significant rewards. In 2011, five years before Hillary Clinton selected Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine to be her running mate in the presidential race, Eche — then known as Jeremy Peter Green, before he got married — purchased ClintonKaine.com. After the former secretary of state made the pick, the squatter offered it to the campaign for a hefty return. They declined, so he sold it for $15,000 to a digital marketing company that turned out to be the Trump campaign. The website pushed anti-Clinton news with “Paid for by Donald J. Trump for President, Inc” emblazoned at the bottom. Harris spent the weekend interviewing a half dozen potential running mates, including Walz, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear, Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, according to two people with knowledge of Harris’ selection process. The people spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private campaign deliberations. She is said to be making her decision imminently and has a slate of planned events with her running mate this week. Eche told the AP that he has not been contacted by anyone connected to the Harris campaign. In 2016, it took a week after Clinton selected Kaine before he connected with anyone from the Clinton campaign, and that was because he had a connection to the operation. He is skeptical Harris’ campaign will reach out before they officially make the pick. “Hopefully (Harris’) people are a little more savvy than Clinton’s people were,” he said. Eche owns at least 15 websites tied to Harris and her selection of a possible running mate. In addition to Walz, he also owns HarrisPritzker.com, a nod to the Illinois governor; HarrisEvers.com, for Wisconsin Gov. Tony Evers; HarrisFetterman.com, for Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman; HarrisWarnock.com, for Georgia Sen. Raphael Warnock; HarrisPeters.com, for Michigan Sen. Gary Peters; and several others. But Eche does have a favorite among her prospective veeps. “Walz is my favorite,” he said. “Of the people she is thinking about, Walz makes the most sense.” He also owns 10 websites featuring Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s name and other Democrats, with an eye toward a possible 2028 presidential run. Eche’s Walz website is now simply a blank chartreuse with the governor’s name in lower-case black letters, a callback to the artist Charli XCX labeling Harris “brat” in a tweet shortly after President Joe Biden ended his campaign, allowing the vice president to take on his operation. That was his wife’s idea, he said. But the site links to his startup’s website — Communer, a site to buy and sell domains and trademarks — where he is offering the Harris slate for $15,000. Eche supported Clinton in 2016, and he supports Harris this cycle. Yet his experience from 2016 — where his website turned into a pro-Trump site — doesn’t give him any pause in selling the Harris sites this time around. “The Harris campaign has hundreds of millions of dollars, so if they don’t buy their own domain, that is kind of on them,” he said. “I’ve got to sell it to somebody. I know I could just donate it, but that is not really how this works. People with billboards aren’t donating their billboards to the campaign. It is just a property basically.” A Harris spokesperson did not immediately respond when asked whether the plan to buy the domains.

Stocks had been dropping at worrisome rates for several days, but on Monday things went from concerning to panicky. At one point, the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 1,200 points, on a day when equity markets tumbled across the globe. It closed down 1,034 points, or 2.6%. Technology stocks have been hit particularly hard lately: The Nasdaq composite was, for a moment on Monday, down more than 10% since the middle of last week, entering into what economists euphemistically call “correction” territory. The sudden pullback has jolted investors and raised questions that go beyond financial markets to questions about the underlying health of the economy. And even when things level out, the window-rattling downturn threatened to kill the political euphoria that has swept over Democrats since President Biden withdrew and Vice President Kamala Harris emerged as the party’s standard-bearer. So what’s happened and what may be next? Here are first-draft-of-history answers to some of the crucial questions: What’s causing the current plunge in U.S. stock markets? Economists point to several factors behind the sell-off. To begin with, tech stocks were overdone, pushed beyond their underlying value by the artificial intelligence craze. Hence the Nasdaq correction. Nvidia, Apple and Intel were among big losers Monday. And Friday’s jobs report, which showed a sharp slowdown in hiring and unemployment in July, set investors — even those not deep into tech — on edge. That came on the heels of news that jobless claims, a proxy for layoffs, increased significantly in the waning days of July. It hasn’t helped that the Federal Reserve has been reluctant to start cutting interest rates, which have throttled inflation as intended, but also weighed down businesses and consumers. Then there’s the reverberation from global markets. On Monday, Japan’s once-high-flying stocks took their worst drubbing since Black Monday in 1987. The huge losses were seen, in part, as being a reaction to market declines and growing concerns in the U.S. “It’s an unfortunate sequence of events that causes selling, selling, selling,” said Christopher Rupkey, chief economist at Fwdbonds, a research house in New York. How have stock markets in the U.S. performed overall this year? Even with Monday’s panic-selling, stocks generally are up for the year, many way up. Both the broader Standard & Poor’s 500 and Nasdaq are still more than 9% higher compared with the start of the year. The Dow is the laggard, up only 2.6% since Jan. 2. Stocks have benefited from strong corporate earnings; investor excitement over AI’s growth and potential; and the expectation of Fed interest rate cuts, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics. “This is still, at this point, a garden-variety correction,” Zandi said of the current turmoil, though he added that the situation warrants careful watching. “Things can take on a life of their own.” Should I be worried about a recession? Not yet, maybe never. The classical definition of a recession is two straight quarters of declining gross domestic product. The latest, second-quarter GDP, after adjusting for inflation, was a strong 2.8%. Almost every economist agrees that you can’t have a recession without job growth turning negative for some extended period. And the U.S. economy hasn’t come close to that point. Employers have added jobs every month since January 2021, when the economy began to recover from the pandemic. Most recently, in July, job growth came in below expectations, but at 114,000 new payroll hires, that was still solidly positive. “I don’t see the underpinnings of an economic downturn,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer and founding partner at Cresset Capital. Can anything be done to arrest the decline in stocks? To quell the sell-off, some investors have urged the Fed to cut interest rates now, in a kind of emergency move ahead of the central bank’s next scheduled meeting in mid-September. Fed officials have taken such steps before, during the pandemic and the Great Recession, for example. But analysts doubt that the policymakers will intervene unless markets keep faltering badly; making an emergency cut could make things worse by frightening people and causing a market meltdown. “It’s certainly not a hair-on-fire moment,” Zandi said. What are the risks going forward? With more people on edge about the economy, further declines in the stock market could erode confidence among businesses and consumers, leading to a pullback in hiring and spending. That would be a psychological development, but economies are not immune to the fears or the hopes of their human components. Consumer spending, which drives the U.S. economy, has held up very well in recent years, thanks to steady job and wage growth. But there are indications from companies such as McDonald’s and Starbucks that consumers are becoming more cautious. Higher-income households account for a disproportionately big share of spending, which has been supported by rising gains in home and stock prices. A sharp drop in stocks would have the reverse impact, a so-called negative wealth effect, making richer households more averse to spending, which could lead to a recession. ©2024 Los Angeles Times.

Radar and satellite images revealed its outer bands remained stretched across the southeastern United States, delivering debilitating rain and winds from Cape Coral to North Carolina. It still boasted maximum sustained winds of 50 mph and a ground speed of just 6 mph. Her inching pace has weather and government officials in three states prepared for a multi-day rainfall event of potentially catastrophic proportions. The National Hurricane Center (NHC) warned that across portions of southeast Georgia, the coastal plain of South Carolina, and southeast North Carolina, 10 to 20 inches of rainfall were expected through Saturday. “This potential historic rainfall will likely result in areas of catastrophic flooding,” the center said in its 5 p.m. EDT advisory. Storm surge and tropical storm watches have been issued for areas north of South Santee River, South Carolina, to Cape Fear, North Carolina. NHC’s projected track has Debby hovering over Georgia and South Carolina, with the center not arriving over North Carolina until Aug. 9. The storm’s forecast caused Vice President Kamala Harris to postpone her campaign stop in Savannah, Georgia, which was scheduled for Aug. 9, according to officials with her presidential campaign. President Joe Biden received a briefing on his administration’s response to Tropical Storm Debby, a White House official said on Aug. 5. “Our administration is in touch with officials from Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina, and FEMA has deployed staff to Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina to assist as needed,” the official said. “We urge residents to remain cautious and listen to state and local officials.” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency on Aug. 1 for 54 of his state’s 67 counties. The next day, he added seven counties to the list. President Biden approved Florida’s emergency declaration on Aug. 3. Several sections of Florida’s West Coast have received more than one foot of rain, and more than four feet of storm surge, with reports of severe flooding and multiple confirmed tornados from Collier County to Levy County. Areas affected included the Charlotte Harbor area and around Tampa Bay. Up to 10 feet of storm surge was predicted for Debby’s impact area of the Panhandle. The National Weather Service offices are currently conducting assessments to determine exact statistics. The deaths of at least four people, including two minors, have been blamed on the storm as Debby’s wind and rain blasted Florida. The driver of a semi-truck died after his 18-wheeler veered off I-75 into the Tampa Bypass Canal on the morning of Aug. 5, according to the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office. The truck was submerged in 14 feet of water and divers recovered the driver’s body from the cab, the agency said in a video posted to X. Further north on Florida’s west coast, a 13-year-old male was crushed by a tree that fell on his mobile home, according to the Levy County Sheriff’s Office (LCSO). Deputies responded to the scene at about 8 a.m. on Aug. 5. DeSantis confirmed two fatalities—a 12-year-old boy and a 38-year-old woman—in a traffic accident in Dixie County. The governor said about 250,000 Floridians were without power as of Aug. 5, although 450,000 accounts had been restored. Those still without power include 113,000 users of private utility companies, 111,000 from coops, and 20,000 customers of municipal utilities. DeSantis and Guthrie said that FDEM had completed 435 storm-related missions, and its teams were proceeding with another 400. Large numbers of emergency workers were activated—including 3,000 members of Florida’s National Guard, and 17,000 linemen—and millions of meals and water bottles readied. However, the governor said he was confident that not all the emergency stockpiles would be necessary. He said he and Guthrie will be visiting affected areas on Aug. 6. “We will not even scratch the surface of needing to use what was mobilized, and I think that’s the way to do it,” the governor said. “We want to make sure that we’re prepared for the worst and we hope for the best. You never want to have a storm, but compared to ... Idalia, this one is not leaving the same destruction in its wake. “We know there’s a lot of water. We know that presents hazards, and we'll be ready to work accordingly.”","summary":"National Hurricane Center forecasts between 10 to 20 inches of rain through Saturday.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/catastrophic-rain-expected-for-georgia-carolinas-as-debby-moves-out-of-florida-5700153","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/05/id5700215-Screen-Shot-2024-08-05-at-5.20.50-PM-300x180.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 22:44:58","author":"T.j.

Independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr shared a video of himself explaining how he left the animal carcass in Central Park a decade ago, that for years remained a mystery. In the 2014 clip he posted to X (formerly Twitter), Kennedy told controversial comedian Rosanne Barr that he was driving to a falconry outing near Goshen when he came across the dead bear. ‘A woman in the van in front of me hit a bear and killed it, a young bear,’ he said while sitting at a table as Barr stood and listened. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Up Next ‘So I pulled over, and I picked up the bear and put him in the back of my van because I was going to skin the bear, and it was in very good condition, and I was going to put the meat in my refrigerator.’ Kennedy continued that in New York ‘you can get a bear tag for roadkill bear’. However, he went on to explain that the hawking went long and that he did not have time to go home to Westchester to drop off the carcass, and instead went straight to New York City for dinner, and afterward had to go to the airport. ‘The bear was in my car, and I didn’t want to leave the bear in the car because that would have been bad,’ he said.

He said he was not drinking but that others with him were and thought he came up with ‘a good idea’ around an old bike that was in his car that he was supposed to dispose of for someone. ‘I said, let’s go put the bear in Central Park, and we’ll make it look like it got hit by a bike,’ Kennedy said. ‘So everybody thought that’s a great idea.’ Independent candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr admitted to dumping a bear carcass in Central Park (Picture: X/@RobertKennedyJr) A campaign bus for Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr is toured during the third day of the 2024 Republican National Convention near the Fiserv Forum on July 17 (Picture: AP) He said the dead bear was all over the news the next day and that he worried because his fingerprints were on the bike, but that it remained a mystery to the public for a decade. Kennedy posted the clip on Sunday, a day before The New Yorker published a profile on him that included a photo of him sitting at the edge of his vehicle trunk and faking a face of pain as he stuffed his fingers in the deceased cub’s mouth. The bear had a visible open wound on its side. The candidate told the magazine when asked about the picture: ‘Maybe that’s where I got my brain worm.’ In another weird twist, Kennedy’s cousin, Tatiana Schlossberg, was the first journalist to report on the bear cub – and told The New York Times that ‘like law enforcement, I had no idea who was responsible for this when I wrote the story’. Independent presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy Jr talks during a campaign event, in West Hollywood, California, in June (Picture: AP) It is not the only weird incident to emerge from Kennedy’s past recently. A month ago, Vanity Fair published a 2010 photo of Kennedy holding an animal carcass. The magazine reported that Kennedy told someone who was traveling to Asia that ‘that he might enjoy a restaurant in Korea that served dog on the menu, suggesting Kennedy had sampled dog’. Kennedy denied the account and said the carcass belonged to a goat. Kennedy, who is the nephew of the US’s 35th president John F Kennedy, left the Democratic Party at the end of last year and announced his bid for the White House as an independent. A Data for Progress poll released in late July showed that ex-President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris were tied at 49% support among likely voters in battleground states, but that Trump had a 1 percentage point lead over Harris when Kennedy and four other candidates were included. With 4% support, Kennedy was the leading candidate after Trump and Harris in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

That’s the question raised by new presidential polling from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and YouGov. The last time the pollsters were in the field in January, former President Donald Trump led President Biden 43% to 39% when “leaners” were factored in. In that survey, Robert Kennedy Jr. had 9% support. Yet during a new survey conducted July 29 to August 1, Trump is behind replacement candidate Vice President Kamala Harris 46% to 43%, with Kennedy down to 6%. When Kennedy voters were asked to choose between the top two candidates, more of them said they would vote for Trump than for Harris, 29% to 26%, with 45% saying they wouldn’t vote at all. That narrows the margins since January’s poll, when the same prompt was given to RFK voters about Trump and Biden. Back then, Trump received support from 33% of the RFK voters while Biden took only 23%. But RFK voters leaning toward Trump aren’t enough to offset Democratic gains elsewhere in a D+4 poll that sampled 42% Democrats, 38% Republicans, and 20% independents. The data indicate Harris’ choice of running mate could give her a boost. Expected Tuesday, the announcement will be a kickoff of her campaign’s battleground-states tour. Roughly half of respondents believe the selection should be a male and about the same amount said he should hail from a swing state. That checks the boxes for Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, two Democrats in the running — and seen as top favorites — as of Monday evening. Among Democrats, 14% want Kelly and 12% prefer Shapiro. Kelly has a slight edge among independents at 7%, with Shapiro and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg not far behind at 5%. The polling points to the former president’s polarization, with 75% of Trump backers saying his accomplishments drive their support and 48% citing Trump’s ability to “save America” as a key point in his favor. Conversely, 66% of those not voting for Trump say he’s a “threat to America,” with 48% of them also blaming Trump for the “Jan. 6 insurrection.” Harris supporters, meanwhile, see her campaign in aspirational terms, with 66% believing the 59-year-old former prosecutor and senator represents a “new generation” in the Democratid Party. Of Harris supporters, 37% think she’ll enhance America’s “global standing,” while 35% think Harris will continue the policies of the Biden administration. Ironically, America’s global standing and the threat of continued Biden policies are key reasons many voters are looking elsewhere, with 77% of Harris haters worried she will perpetuate Bidenism and 49% convinced she will erode international perception of the United States. When asked about candidate qualities, Harris has the advantage over Trump in being perceived as compassionate, energetic, likable, intelligent, hardworking and “moderate,” which suggests Trump’s branding of her as “dangerously liberal” isn’t catching on. Trump is thought of as more experienced, strong and patriotic. The polling also indicates the prospect of a Harris election inspires more positive feelings than Biden’s re-election would have, with twice as many people saying they would feel “pride” if the vice president was elected in November rather than the incumbent. A quarter of independents say they’re more excited about voting in a Harris-Trump race, but that number is dwarfed by the 66% of Democrats and the 37% of Republicans who say the same.","summary":"Is it a case of Kamala-mentum?","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/us-news/kamala-harris-gains-7-points-in-national-poll-and-a-swing-state-vp-could-boost-her-even-more/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/newspress-collage-wir9o54mi-1722890426763.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1722876109&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/rMZ42omc-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-05 22:38:22","author":"A.g.

This “may be the most audacious plan a political party has ever undertaken. It requires the effective deployment of the full toolkit of press and social media deception: selective editorial amnesia, gaslighting, memory-holing.” Derailing it demands “a focused, disciplined and relentless Republican campaign”: “If the election is decided on the issues, on voters’ perceptions of the state of the country,” she “is surely in as much trouble as Mr. Biden was.” But if the GOP bogs down in “pointless assertions about Ms. Harris’s racial identity” and other “diversions,” then “she may get away with skating past the realities of her past.” From the left: Big Brother Starmer In response to anti-immigrant riots after the killing of three girls in Southport, England, Prime Minister Keir Starmer held a press conference “shocking even by current neo-Orwellian standards,” thunders Racket News’ Matt Taibbi — “sounding like a starched cross of Dick Cheney and Justin Trudeau” as he laid out “as aggressive a vision of pre-crime enforcement as we’ve heard from a prominent Western politician” that would “stop people traveling, identify and prevent their patterns of behavior.” This “comes in the context of a growing international movement to combine expanded definitions of incitement with ‘preventive’ enforcement.” Oddly, “the press increasingly seems less interested in getting information than egging politicians on.” Indeed, “the troubling angle to the Southport story is how heavily authorities and the media emphasized ‘disinformation’ as the problem.” From the right: Soft DAs Embolden Rioters After the July 24 protesters “laid waste to historic monuments outside of Union Station,” some “were properly arrested,” yet “nearly a dozen have seen their charges dropped,” fumes Trey Hammond at City Journal. This, when “the January 6-ers have been prosecuted enthusiastically by federal officials. Why have criminal elements who have called for the death of Jews and the destruction of America, and engaged in similar mayhem, not faced similar penalties?” Prosecutors who “decline to enforce the law” signal “that vandalism and other criminal acts are acceptable,” which “emboldens those who would flout our laws.” Libertarian: Maduro’s Black Eye for Uncle Sam Team Biden’s focus on “negotiating sanctions relief for the [Nicolás] Maduro regime in exchange for promises to hold free and fair elections” failed, argues Jorge Jraissati at Reason. He’s claimed victory even as “governments around the world” denounce “the election as fraudulent.” Now “supporting the democratic aspirations of Venezuelans is crucial for U.S. interests,” as “should Maduro remain in power, migration to the United States from Venezuela is expected to surge.” Plus, “Maduro’s continued rule will also likely increase the presence of U.S. adversaries such as Russia, Iran, and China in the region.” Failing to counter Maduro imperils “U.S. national security, economic performance, and diplomatic standing.” Media watch: Putin Propagandists at VOA “The dangerous loopholes in security vetting of Voice of America (VOA) talent have finally come to the fore,” laments Ted Lipien at The Hill in light of the recent “Russia-West prisoner swap” that released “an alleged Russian spy posing as a VOA freelance journalist.” The spy “was a Voice of America freelancer, Pablo González,” aka Pavel Rubtsov, “whom Ukraine and Poland had accused of working for Russian military intelligence.” When arrested by Poland, “the initial Voice of America news report indicated no association” with Gonzalez. “Why would an American institution, chartered by Congress, hire this obviously unvetted propagandist?” Despite warnings, VOA has “hired even more former Putin media propagandists.” And, after several security-related scandals, the US Intelligence Service “revoked” VOA parent US Agency of Global Media’s “authority to conduct employee background investigations.” — Compiled by The Post Editorial Board","summary":"“Can the Democrats and a collaborative media pull off their recasting of Vice President Kamala Harris” into “the holy trinity of Joan of Arc, Harriet Tubman and Margaret Thatcher we have been presented with in the past two weeks?”","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/05/opinion/reinventing-kamala-harris-big-brother-starmer-and-other-commentary/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/2019-harris-daughter-immigrants-rose-87047318_1fef40-e1722892895487.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-05 22:32:19","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"entertainment","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.075},{"id":253450974,"title":"Biden, Harris watch for Iran retaliation","text":"Washington braced for an expected Iranian retaliation for the killing of a top Hamas leader in Tehran last week, even as deep uncertainty swirled around when Iran would act — and how far it might go. Multiple United States officials across the region and in Washington told CNN that the US expects Iran to retaliate in the coming days – perhaps even within the next 24 hours – against Israel for Ismail Haniyeh's killing. But the US has struggled to gauge when the response will come and what form it will take, in part because Iran already moved some of the military assets necessary to carry out a major attack on Israel in April, making it more difficult for American intelligence to predict its actions now, according to two US officials. OLYMPIC HUB: You can find all the latest Paris 2024 stories from Wide World Of Sport here Officials are relying on multiple streams of intelligence, and there are divisions among national security officials on how and when Iran's response might unfold. The relative uncertainty has left the Biden administration in a defensive crouch as it tries to rally allies and pressure Iran not to escalate tensions. The killing of Haniyeh – who served as a top Hamas political figure whose job included a role as one of the group's chief hostage and ceasefire negotiators – along with the killing of Hezbollah leader Fu'ad Shukr in Lebanon last week have thrown the war into its most uncertain phase. While the bulk of the war has been fought between Israel and Iran's proxies – Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon – Haniyeh's assassination on Iranian soil and Iran's vows of retaliation threaten to throw the conflict into a regional war that could draw in the US. Israel claimed credit for Shakr's killing, which came in response to a rocket strike that killed 12 children in the town of Majdal Shams in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, but has not yet done so for Haniyeh's killing in Iran. OLYMPIC SCHEDULE: Your day-to-day guide to all the action in Paris, in AEST times The extent of the United States' further involvement in the war largely depends on how exactly Iran responds to Haniyeh's death. In preparation for possible Iranian retaliation, two American destroyers moved from the Gulf of Oman to the Red Sea in recent days, according to a US official – putting both ships closer to Israel. The destroyers, the USS Laboon and the USS Cole, are part of a number of assets US Central Command has placed strategically across the region amid fears that Iran could soon launch a major attack on Israel for the second time this year. US destroyers helped shoot down ballistic missiles and drones launched by Iran at Israel in April. Biden spoke with the Jordanian king on Monday morning, where both leaders discussed efforts to \"de-escalate regional tensions,\" according to a White House readout. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris also met with the administration's national security team in the White House Situation Room later on Monday. READ MORE: Hezbollah says it launched a drone attack on northern Israel﻿ The Jordanian king emphasised the need for de-escalation in the region while also warning of extremist settler violence against Palestinians. The US has been asking countries that have diplomatic relations with Iran to urge the country not to escalate the conflict, a State Department spokesman said Monday. \"We have been sending consistent messages through our diplomatic engagements encouraging people to communicate to the government of Iran that escalation is not in their interest and that we will defend Israel from attacks, and that escalation does not serve Iran's interest, just as it doesn't serve the interests of anyone in the region,\" the spokesman, Matthew Miller, said. Miller declined to give a timeframe of when the US expects Iran to retaliate. But he added: \"We don't think this attack should happen, and we are working to try to prevent it from happening.\" In April, Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles toward Israel in retaliation for the killing of some of its officials at what it considered a diplomatic compound in Syria, the first time Iran had taken direct action against Israel in decades. But that time, officials said, Tehran telegraphed its intent, and the US was able to see the movement of weapons systems and other equipment into place — a key marker that US intelligence officials often use to judge when and what kind of military action an adversary is planning. That intelligence was part of how US Central Command was able to form a defensive alliance and coordinate a strategy that ultimately led to the successful shooting-down of almost all of the projectiles Iran fired that night. This time, according to officials who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity, the American intelligence picture is much murkier. The Biden administration is racing the clock to try to keep the situation from spiralling into all-out war — even as officials have privately expressed scepticism that it will be possible to constrain Iran.
