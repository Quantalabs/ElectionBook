Russell Vought, the White House budget director, said on social media that “the Left’s climate agenda is being canceled.”\n\nU.S. District Judge Amit Mehta said the administration’s action violated the Constitution’s equal protection requirements.\n\n“Defendants freely admit that they made grant-termination decisions primarily — if not exclusively — based on whether the awardee resided in a state whose citizens voted for President Trump in 2024,” Mehta wrote in a 17-page opinion. The administration offered no explanation for how their purposeful targeting of grant recipients based on their electoral support for Trump — or lack of it — “rationally advances their stated government interest,” the judge added.\n\nThe ruling was the second legal setback for the administration’s rollback of clean energy program in a matter of hours. A separate federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as Trump seeks to shut it down.\n\nA spokesman for the Energy Department said officials disagree with the judge’s decision on clean energy grants.\n\nOfficials “stand by our review process, which evaluated these awards individually and determined they did not meet the standards necessary to justify the continued spending of taxpayer dollars,” spokesman Ben Dietderich said. “The American people deserve a government that is accountable and responsible in managing taxpayer funds.” \n\nProjects were canceled in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. All 16 targeted states supported Harris.\n\nThe cuts include up to $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub that is aimed at accelerating hydrogen technology and production, and up to $1 billion for a hydrogen project in the Pacific Northwest. A Texas hydrogen project and a three-state project in West Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania were spared, according to clean-energy supporters who obtained a list of the DOE targets.\n\nThe city of St. Paul and a coalition of environmental groups filed a lawsuit after they lost grants.\n\nTrump said in an interview last fall with One America News, a conservative outlet, that his administration could cut projects that Democrats want. “I’m allowed to cut things that never should have been approved in the first place and I will probably do that,” Trump said in the Oct. 1 interview.\n\nVickie Patton, general counsel for the Environmental Defense Fund, one of the groups that filed the suit, said the court ruling “recognized that the Trump Department of Energy vindictively canceled projects for clean affordable energy that just happened to be in states disfavored by the Trump administration, in violation of the bedrock Constitutional guarantee that all people in all states have equal protection under the law.”\n\nThe administration’s actions violated the Constitution, foundational American values and “imposed high costs on the American people who rely on clean affordable energy for their pocketbooks and for healthier lives,” Patton said.\n\nAnne Evens, CEO of Elevate Energy, one of the groups that lost funding, said the court ruling would help keep clean energy affordable and create jobs.\n\n“Affordable energy should be a reality for everyone, and the restoration of these grants is an important step toward making that possible,” she said.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/trump-clean-energy-democrats-blue-state-hydrogen-9269a5a839122e1b3fd487787747d47e","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/e16e663/2147483647/strip/false/crop/2392x1600+0+0/resize/1486x994!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F4a%2Fe2%2F44937d418076667d925ac6ee8df2%2Fc79a18abff9547cba884dc7c87db8c62","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-12 22:25:29","author":"Matthew Daly","authors":["Matthew Daly"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.511},{"id":392478758,"title":"Wind developers fight Trump's 'windmill' opposition in court appearances","text":"A federal judge ruled Monday that work on a major offshore wind farm for Rhode Island and Connecticut can resume, handing the industry at least a temporary victory as President Donald Trump seeks to shut it down. \n\nAt the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, Senior Judge Royce Lamberth said the government did not explain why it could not take action short of a complete stop to construction on Revolution Wind while it considers ways to mitigate its national security concerns. He said it also did not provide sufficient reasoning for its change in position. \n\nRevolution Wind has received all of its federal permits and is nearly 90% complete to provide power for Rhode Island and Connecticut.\n\nTrump says his goal is to not let any “windmills” be built. Three energy developers are challenging the administration’s freeze of their offshore wind projects in the federal courts this week.\n\nDanish energy company Orsted, Norwegian company Equinor, and Dominion Energy Virginia each sued to ask the courts to vacate and set aside the administration’s Dec. 22 order to freeze five big projects on the East Coast over national security concerns. Orsted’s hearing was first on its Revolution Wind project. Orsted said it will soon resume construction to deliver affordable, reliable power to the Northeast.\n\nThe administration did not reveal specifics about its national security concerns, but Trump said Friday while meeting with oil industry executives about investing in Venezuela that wind farms are “losers.” He said they lose money, destroy the landscape and kill birds.\n\n“I’ve told my people we will not approve windmills,” Trump said. “Maybe we get forced to do something because some stupid person in the Biden administration agreed to do something years ago. We will not approve any windmills in this country.”\n\nThe Biden administration sought to ramp up offshore wind as a climate change solution. Trump began reversing the country’s energy policies his first day in office with a spate of executive orders aimed at boosting oil, gas and coal. A federal judge ruled Monday that the Trump administration acted illegally when it canceled $7.6 billion in clean energy grants for projects in states that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe Trump administration paused leases for the Vineyard Wind project under construction in Massachusetts, Revolution Wind, Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, and two projects in New York: Sunrise Wind and Empire Wind. New York’s attorney general sued the Trump administration on Friday over Empire Wind and Sunrise Wind. \n\nRevolution Wind and Sunrise Wind are both major offshore wind projects by Orsted. Rhode Island and Connecticut filed their own request in court to try to save Revolution Wind.\n\n“The law takes precedent over the political whims of one man, and we will continue to fight to make sure that remains the case,” Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said in a statement.\n\nAt Monday’s hearing, attorney Janice Schneider, representing Revolution Wind, said the stop work order came at a critical stage of construction, with the project nearly 90% built and weeks away from beginning to deliver power to the electric grid. She said the delay is costing more than $1.4 million per day, and a specialized vessel has just enough time now to install the remaining turbines before its contract is up at the site in February. \n\nSchneider said they take national security issues seriously, but the government has not shared more information about its concerns with their experts who have security clearances, or shared unclassified summaries. \n\n“We do think that this court should be very skeptical of the government’s true motives here,” Schneider said, citing Trump’s comments from Friday. \n\nDepartment of Justice attorney Peter Torstensen argued that national security is paramount and protecting against new risks identified in the classified materials outweighs any alleged irreparable harm to the developers.\n\nWork on the Revolution Wind project was previously paused on Aug. 22 for what the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management said were national security concerns. A month later, Judge Lamberth ruled the project could resume, citing the irreparable harm to the developers and the demonstrated likelihood of success on the merits of their claim. Orsted is building it with Skyborn Renewables.\n\nWith four offshore wind projects still stalled, Hillary Bright, executive director of offshore wind advocacy group Turn Forward, said she’s hopeful that they will prevail in court and that the administration will begin to understand “the immense benefits that these nearly complete power sources can bring to our nation’s energy and national security.”\n\nEquinor owns Empire Wind. Its limited liability company, Empire Wind LLC, said the project faces “likely termination” if construction can’t resume by this Friday because the order disrupts a tightly choreographed construction schedule dependent on vessels with very limited availability. Its hearing is Wednesday.\n\n“I would like to think that offshore wind is, and will continue to be, part of an all-of-the-above energy solution, which our country desperately needs,” said Molly Morris, Equinor’s senior vice president overseeing Empire Wind. \n\nDominion Energy Virginia, which is developing Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind, was the first to sue. It’s asking a judge to block the order, calling it “arbitrary and capricious” and unconstitutional. Its hearing is Friday.\n\nAssociated Press writer Matthew Daly contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press’ climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

Mary Peltola said on Monday she would challenge Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan in this year’s midterm elections, delighting party leaders who view her candidacy as critical for efforts to retake control of the U.S. Senate.\n\nPeltola is among a handful of Democrats who have recently won statewide elections in red states, and she vowed to shake up the establishment to make life more affordable for Alaskans. \n\n“Life is difficult here, and we know that we have to take care of each other,” Peltola said in a video announcement. \n\nDemocrats must flip four seats to win the majority in the 100-member Senate, a task that would require ousting Republicans in states recently won by Donald Trump in the presidential election, while also defending their own incumbents. \n\nPeltola, who is Yup’ik, was the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress. She won special and regular elections in 2022 for Alaska’s only House seat, defeating a field that included Republican former Gov. Sarah Palin. In 2024, Peltola lost to Republican Nick Begich, who had unsuccessfully run in 2022.\n\nHer time in Congress was marked by tragedy. Her mother died in 2023, and her husband died in a plane crash later that year. \n\nPeltola focused on local concerns in her announcement, saying Alaska’s future depends on fixing the “rigged system in D.C. that’s shutting down Alaska, while politicians feather their own nests.”\n\nShe said the salmon and migratory birds that once filled the freezers of Alaska Native subsistence hunters are now harder to find, forcing families who live far from the state’s limited road system to rely on grocery stores for pricey staples, driven up by high transportation costs.\n\n“It’s not just that politicians in D.C. don’t care that we’re paying $17 for a gallon of milk in rural Alaska,” she said. “They don’t even believe us. They’re more focused on their stock portfolios than our bank accounts.”\n\nAlaska could prove to be difficult political terrain. Sullivan, a former state attorney general and natural resources commissioner, defeated the state’s last Democratic senator in 2014.\n\nHe reported $4.7 million available in his last campaign finance report, which included the third quarter of 2025. New reports are expected soon.\n\nStill, Democrats were upbeat about Peltola’s bid. \n\nState party chair Eric Croft called Peltola “our most steadfast champion and a strong voice for Alaskans in every region of our state.” Lauren French, a spokesperson for the Senate Majority PAC, a Democratic campaign organization, said Peltola’s decision to run “completely upends the campaign.”\n\nMost registered voters in Alaska aren’t affiliated with a political party. Both the state House and the state Senate are controlled by bipartisan coalitions. \n\nThe Republican National Committee said Peltola became “a rubber stamp for the far-left the second she got to Washington.”\n\n“Alaskans saw through her empty promises then showed her the door, and she’ll lose to Dan Sullivan who fights for Alaskans every day,” RNC spokesperson Nick Poche said in a statement.\n\nWhile serving in Washington, Sullivan has been involved in military and resource development issues. He was endorsed by Trump in 2020.\n\nNate Adams, a campaign spokesman for Sullivan, said the senator “has spent years delivering real results” while “his opponent served a term and a half in Congress where she didn’t pass a single bill.”\n\nPeltola has long touted her ability to work across party lines, such as supporting the large Willow oil project on Alaska’s North Slope. She angered some Democrats in 2024 when she refused to endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race won by Trump.\n\nPeltola said Alaska’s Republican congressional delegation used to ignore partisanship and do what was right for the state, such as backing public media and disaster relief, and even invoked Republican former Sen. Ted Stevens. \n\n“It’s about time Alaskans teach the rest of the country what Alaska First and, really, America First looks like,” Peltola said.\n\nAlaska has open primaries and ranked choice voting in general elections. The top four vote-getters in the August primary regardless of party affiliation will advance to the November general election.\n\nThiessen reported from Anchorage, Alaska.","url":"https://apnews.com/article/alaska-senate-peltola-sullivan-3fd17afc556641652e83e9c11d700306","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/095c835/2147483647/strip/false/crop/3000x2000+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2F39%2Fc0%2Fd404679744a8209adf2134a3822a%2Fae5a75a9f3184ea4aa3ecaf705bb2120","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-12 13:00:09","author":"Becky Bohrer,Mark Thiessen","authors":["Becky Bohrer","Mark Thiessen"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.13},{"id":392399794,"title":"Democratic committee chair compares US to Iran, claims both are 'killing protesters'","text":"Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Ken Martin compared the U.S. to Iran in several social media posts Sunday, claiming both countries are guilty of \"killing protesters.\" Martin made his first comparison on X, expressing support for both protesters in the U.S. and Iran for rising up against \"systems that wield violence without accountability.\" \"From Tehran to my birthplace of Minneapolis, people are rising up against systems that wield violence without accountability.

In an October edition of the “PBD Podcast,” the host praised Barron Trump as “tall” and “witty” before inquiring about reports that the 19-year-old New York University student shut down an entire floor of Trump Tower for “a date.” The elder Trump, 42, responded with a disturbingly long diatribe about his younger brother’s sex life, comparing him to Van Wilder, a character from an inexcusable sex comedy released four years before Barron’s birth.\n\n“Shutting down a floor of Trump Tower is like PG-13 versus where my mind would have been at his at his age in terms of the dating scene,” Eric Trump said. “But honestly, Barron’s a great kid.” His comments cemented the impression that he’s probably never said more than three words to a half-sibling born two wives after his own mother.\n\nEric Trump’s response was uncomfortable, but there’s a reason he leaned into the moment. He is likely quite aware of how much right-wing media is invested in portraying Barron Trump as a dashing sex symbol and international playboy. It’s so silly that many loyal MAGA posters on X fell for a tweet suggesting that Donald Trump should acquire Greenland by marrying his son off to Princess Isabella of Denmark. It was obviously a joke, but for those who have pickled their brains on the Fox News Cinematic Universe, casting the NYU student and son of a failed fashion model as an American prince made perfect sense. It’s all they’ve been hearing about this lanky teenager for months now.\n\nThe buzz started at his father’s inauguration, when Barron Trump shook hands with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, which was treated as an act of magnanimity on the level with writing a billion dollar check to a cancer charity. MAGA media outlets highlighted social media posts predicting Barron “will be our President one day” and calling him a “very classy act” or just saying “WOW.”\n\nThe cringeworthy Barron thirst has continued since then. In August, host Jesse Watters suggested — and this time it wasn’t a joke — that he should marry 28-year-old famously white actress Sydney Sweeney to make “the greatest political dynasty in American history.”\n\nIn October, upon hearing that Barron Trump had a date, Watters and guest Julie Banderas claimed that “this guy’s got game” and hoped “something good came out of that date.” Watters insisted the kid is “a ladies’ man” because he’s “tall and handsome.”\n\nBarron Trump is indeed tall, with the number 6 feet, 7 inches floated around, though with the cautionary note that the Trumps lie about everything. But it is true that, on the rare occasion they’re seen together, Barron towers over his father. The younger Trump’s height appears to be the sole real-life quality of his that MAGA media is hanging this “ladies man” image on. It certainly is the only aspect of his son that Donald Trump has taken notice of, as he brags constantly about how tall his son is. But in the apparent drive to make Barron an all-American crush object, there have been efforts to suggest he has other attributes.\n\nMelania Trump has given her son credit for her husband’s 2024 victory, telling Fox News, “He brought in success because he knew exactly who his father needs to contact and to talk to.” Donald Trump also credited his son for bringing “the youth vote by 36 points” — another false claim, as Harris won the 18-24 demographic with 54% of the vote.\n\nMAGA social media swoons over how rich Barron is, ignoring that it’s only because rich people use the Trump family’s crypto accounts as a way to buy favor without leaving a paper trail. The president even tried to pass his son off as a “smart guy” with “an unbelievable aptitude in technology.” His evidence? Barron was able to turn on a laptop that his 79-year-old father struggled with.\n\nExcept for the gullible MAGA masses, the contradictions in the story of Barron Trump as the Sexiest Man Alive are too glaring to be ignored. The “ladies man” doesn’t seem to be seen with many ladies. To the contrary, the New York Times reported that Barron has a close relationship with accused rapist Andrew Tate, who is most famous for offering dating “advice” to preteen boys and deeply immature men too ignorant to see that it’s obvious nonsense. In a story planted by Trump-friendly sources in People magazine, there was an attempt to spin this with claims that Barron Trump is too busy with “school, a family who dotes on him and a career of his own” to date right now. \n\nThe family’s insecurity over this surged into view last week, when the alleged “ladies man” was photographed doing the lamest possible thing on New Year’s Eve: hanging out with his parents at Mar-a-Lago. Stories about Melania Trump’s displeasure over the leaked photos were immediately pushed in the tabloid press, along with quotes like, “It’s very understood that guests don’t bother Barron.”\n\nWhile this may scare members out of further embarrassing the college kid with future photos of his very parent-centric social activities, having his mom swoop in to protect him does not bode well for the efforts to paint him as the family’s romantic princeling.\n\nWant more Amanda Marcotte on politics? Sign up for her free newsletter, Standing Room Only, now also on YouTube or wherever you get your podcasts.\n\nStill, there’s a huge MAGA audience ready to gobble down stories about how the Trump family is producing hot young celebrities like, say, the Kennedy family has a long history of doing. Along with Barron, they’ve been pushing out Kai Trump — who is a little more game to speak on-camera — to do the podcast tour, swearing up and down that being the daughter of Don Jr., the eldest Trump sibling, is awesome. But even she can’t escape the MAGA hunger to turn her uncle Barron, who is only one year older than her, into a proper celebrity. On a recent episode of Logan Paul’s podcast, she was prompted to talk about Barron, and she tried, though all she could say is he’s “cool” and agree that he is, indeed, very tall.\n\nPerhaps the funniest bit of the Barron Trump thirst, which arrives courtesy of Margaret Hartmann at New York magazine — is a viral AI video of a badly-animated Barron singing and playing piano on “America’s Got Talent.” And yes, you best believe he is not singing any pop genre that an NYU sophomore would like, but instead treacly worship music with painfully clichéd lyrics. The comments are a mish-mash of people praising the Trumps and Jesus, while others beg viewers to recognize the video is fake.\n\nThe whole situation is an encapsulation of why the Trump PR machine wants Barron Trump to be a sex symbol and, beyond his obvious inadequacy for such a role, why the enterprise is doomed. (To be clear, I am casting no shade, as most people don’t make the cut in the contest to be an international crush object.)\n\nThe MAGA movement lives in perpetual jealousy of mainstream culture, attributing their lack of coolness to a “liberal” conspiracy to shut right-wing folks out of celebrity. But, as demonstrated by the uncool musical acts that showed up to perform at Charlie Kirk’s memorial in September, it’s really more that the MAGA world is simply too mediocre and out-of-touch to produce artists or celebrities that impress people outside of their own circles.\n\nIronically, it may be Barron Trump’s relative silence that makes him such a fantasy object on the right. They want so badly to have the Trump family produce glamorous, charismatic figures like the Kennedys, but the ones who actually plop themselves in front of microphones and cameras are annoying and awful, turning off everyone who isn’t already in the MAGA fold. Barron Trump, though, is both tall and quiet, making him a visible presence that they can project all their hopes on. Well, at least as long as the family can keep more humiliating pictures of him hanging out with his parents from leaking to the press.","summary":"The right desperately wants the youngest Trump son to be a sex symbol","url":"https://www.salon.com/2026/01/12/maga-is-weirdly-thirsty-for-barron-trump/","image":"https://www.salon.com/app/uploads/2026/01/Barron-Trump-2194975877-150x150.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-12 11:45:28","author":"Amanda Marcotte","authors":["Amanda Marcotte"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.053},{"id":392423892,"title":"The Backcountry Rescue Squad at America’s Busiest National Park","text":"Every year, the park logs more than twelve million visits, some of which go poorly. From the annals of misadventure and bad luck: A fifteen-year-old boy jumped between rocks at a scenic overlook and fell five hundred feet. Lightning struck near where a man lay reading in his tent; the charge “welded” him to the ground for at least ten seconds. A cyclist hit a deer and flew over the handlebars. A hundred and seventy-five feet deep in a cave, two spelunkers ran out of rope. A child got separated from his family and wound up at the base of a cliff. Hikers discovered a man freezing on the Appalachian Trail, seventy-four miles of which pass through the park; he didn’t have a coat, and had wrapped his feet in underwear and duct tape. A fisherman was stung more than a hundred times by yellow jackets. Three stranded backpackers, unable to figure out how to build a proper fire, even with a small blowtorch, burned their clothes. A kid tried to cross a flooding river after his friends warned him not to, and was swept downstream. An inner tuber fell into a river and got trapped between submerged rocks. “The river will take you,” John Sharbel, a veteran white-water rafter, told me the other day. His friends call him Sharbs. He had just texted me a video of himself on Class V rapids, where—bloop!—he popped right out of his boat. In the national parks, drowning ranks behind only motor-vehicle crashes as the leading cause of accidental death. Sharbs’s rafting drama ended with him dragging himself onto a riverbank and bushwhacking his way back to camp, where one of his buddies, Big Bill, unaware of the bloop, asked, “Why’re you so dirty?” Sharbs also texted me a photo of a random male rafter wearing cartoonishly enormous silicone boobs, and a shot of the under-chin of the youngest of his three sons, who had just spent a morning in the E.R. (Pogo stick; five stitches.)\nSharbs, who is in his early forties, grew up in Knoxville, thirty-six miles north of the park, and has been a Smokies regular since elementary school. In the early two-thousands, he and his wife, Laura, a veterinarian, worked on cattle ranches in California. “When we would do roundups, there was this old firefighter who’d come out and help us, and I’d talk to him and think, That sounds like a pretty cool life style,” he said. Firefighting didn’t stick. Sharbs joined the Tennessee Army National Guard. In 2012, he deployed to Afghanistan and spent a year in Helmand Province, as a combat medic. He was telling me about it over sandwiches in the park, at a picnic table beside the Little River, when an acorn the size of a golf ball very nearly fell on my head. Sharbs went “Holy shit!” Then he said, “Also a big killer in the park? Falling tree branches.” Dead, dangling limbs are called widow-makers. Jonathan Dee, the park’s medical director, who is a family physician, told me that a patient once asked him which of the park’s wild animals frightened him most; he said that nothing scared him more than the wind.\nIn the American West, visitors to national parks know to expect remoteness. The Smokies’ proximity to cities creates a false sense of security. The park is headquartered in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, which has been characterized as an amusement venue posing as a town. You can step out of the forest and play laser tag or eat a corn dog. Chockablock on the main street there’s Smoky Vapes, Pancake Pantry, Gatlin’s Rugged Ropes Adventure Course, the Hollywood Star Cars Museum, Ripley’s Believe It or Not!, Ripley’s Mountain Coaster, Ripley’s Davy Crockett Mini-Golf, Ripley’s Haunted Adventure, Ripley’s Super Fun Zone!, Ripley’s Motion Blaster, Ripley’s Mirror Maze (and, behind it, Ripley’s Aquarium of the Smokies), plus an attraction where, after a ten-minute ascent on a canary-yellow chairlift, you can cross a gorge via a cable footbridge designed to tilt and sway with each step. There’s a Trump Superstore, and a sky phallus called the Space Needle. Oversized humanoid art installations appear seasonally on downtown benches; I witnessed “pumpkin people” in October, “snow people” in November.\nA brochure describes Gatlinburg as America’s “mountain paradise.” Allow me to vouch for the following: Tennessee barbecue; a rock shop owned by a mountaineer who told me ghost stories; a handwritten sign at the checkout counter of Old Dad’s General Store which reads “Please Do Not Lick Your Fingers to separate your cash when you are paying”; serendipitous bluegrass performances on the front steps of the convention center; and the elevated patio of a certain creekside restaurant where, one golden afternoon, as I ended the day with a cocktail and a book, a big bear ambled by. (Nineteen hundred black bears live in the Smokies.) People on the patio leapt from their seats and crowded the railing, holding up their phones. No one stayed to admire the bear; they just wanted the picture. According to Reddit, travellers often go to the Smokies looking for a “good nature area to drive around in,” or for “outdoors without the outdoors.”\nPark rangers respond to and manage every emergency, but they routinely need outside help to conduct rescues, especially deep in the backcountry. Herrington, like Sharbs, is a seasoned search-and-rescue volunteer. They, and others like them, are essential to public-safety operations in the Smokies, in part because they have so much experience in that highly specific environment.\nOne afternoon in October, I met Herrington at Look Rock, the apex of the Foothills Parkway, on the western end of the park, near Townsend, which calls itself “the peaceful side of the Smokies.” The crowds and traffic are less intense than in Gatlinburg, and the mountain views are unimpeded; decades ago, Townsend limited development. A Ripley’s Peaceful Side is unimaginable.\nHerrington and I left our vehicles in a deserted parking lot and followed a manway through a band of trees, stepping over roots the size of boa constrictors. At the dizzying edge of a sandstone cliff, he spread a park map on a boulder and ran a hand across it. “It’s hard to grasp the immensity,” he said. A particularly remote pocket, Tricorner Knob, has a reputation for being one of the nation’s “true wilderness areas.” When I asked Herrington to describe the park’s personality, he said, “The park is just neutral. People are, like, ‘Mother Nature’s out to kill you’ or ‘Mother Nature’s out to help you.’ It doesn’t care. It just does its thing.”\nHerrington had turned fifty the previous day. He has a reddish-gray beard and bright-blue eyes, and shaves his head. He talks fast and drinks not much alcohol and no coffee. He is twice divorced, with an eleven-year-old son and an eight-year-old daughter. He lives just outside the park, in a house that he built on a mountainside, with a catfish lake at the foot of his driveway and a yard full of chickens, which he keeps mainly for the eggs. To get there, you drive an infamous eleven-mile section of two-lane highway called the Dragon’s Tail, which has three hundred and eighteen curves. When I visited, in November, photographers had stationed themselves at pull-offs, to shoot pictures of motorcycle daredevils and a nose-to-bumper caravan of candy-colored Corvettes. Herrington told me, “If my kids ever want a motorcycle, I’ll tell them, ‘First, you’re gonna go work the Dragon’s Tail for a year with the Blount County Rescue Squad. Pick up all the pieces, see what that’s like.’ ”\nHerrington’s injury, a depression fracture, temporarily paralyzed much of the left side of his body, and derailed his goal of becoming an Army Ranger. Instead, he studied wildlife biology at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, as he recovered from a cranioplasty. (There’s now a metal plate in his head.) He entered what he called his bushcraft phase. “I wore all wool clothes, carried a big axe,” he said. He travelled to Canada to study with survival instructors, and he read a lot: “The Forager’s Harvest,” “The Outdoor Survival Handbook,” “Six Ways In and Twelve Ways Out,” “98.6 Degrees: The Art of Keeping Your Ass Alive!” He told me, “When I get into something, I get really into it.”\nIn 1998, Herrington heard an interview, on NPR, with Rick Varner, who hunted feral hogs for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Varner described the creatures as diabolically cunning, destructive, and nocturnal. He would hike ten or twelve miles at night, hunting, and spend daylight hours in camp, reading. Some weeks, it rained every day. A lot of the time, his knees hurt. He would assemble and bait chain-link traps, which had been dropped by helicopter. The policy was to shoot and bury your catch. Critics complained about squandered meat, but Varner told NPR, “Nothing goes to waste in the wild.” He considered it payback when bears came across that “chunk of protein”—feral hogs are an invasive species.\nTo Herrington, Varner’s life sounded like “a boy’s dream.” He volunteered in the Smokies’ hog-hunting program, and called Varner Rambo Ricky. Soon, he got hired, and asked to be assigned to the Twentymile district, a remote posting near the Dragon’s Tail. Long stretches of solitude neither bothered him nor appeared to impair his sociability. Herrington is more gregarious and diplomatic—though perhaps not less introspective—than what you might expect from someone who’s spent so much time alone in the woods. One day, he told me, “Men typically have either a trust issue or an unworthiness thing. If it’s that unworthiness thing, you start to seek external validation through achievement, adventure, women, all that type of stuff.”\nIn 2008, Herrington became a Smokies law-enforcement ranger, energized by the thought of hunting poachers of ginseng and game. He often put his hand up for search-and-rescue missions, and realized that he wanted to be involved in SAR work for the rest of his life after he and Rambo Ricky found a pair of lost grandparents by blowing whistles, a low-tech piece of lifesaving gear. As the grandparents reunited with their family, Herrington had to step away and compose himself.\nThe Park Service closed Twentymile’s station. Herrington couldn’t think of anything worse than being posted to Gatlinburg, or saddled with “sneaking around campgrounds looking for dope smokers, babysitting tubers, or typing report after report.” While listening to a podcast called “Peace Revolution,” he decided that staying on for the next twenty-five years wasn’t worth a future pension of twelve hundred dollars a month. In 2013, he resigned, giving his written reason as “new chapter of life.” You sure? his boss asked. Until recently, a job with the federal government was one of the most stable in the United States. Herrington was sure. A month later, he filed incorporation papers for a new company, BigPig Outdoors, and became a wilderness educator.\nAt BigPig, Herrington’s students ranged from middle schoolers to game wardens. He taught land navigation, wilderness first aid, foraging. He customized courses for women’s groups, companies, and families, and trained prospective contestants of the Discovery Channel show “Naked and Afraid,” in which a man and a woman are stranded in a remote location without clothes, food, or water, and with one personal item each, and must work together to survive for three weeks. At R.E.I., he taught a free course, “Reality of Survival.” On BigPig’s blog, he published roundups of global search-and-rescue cases, often posting (and unpacking the correct responses to) hypotheticals. You slip and knock yourself out while deer hunting, and wake up disoriented; stranded by a freak snowstorm, you’re running low on food after three days in a backcountry shelter. Now what?\nHerrington homesteaded. He ate daylilies, violet greens, chickweed, shepherd’s purse, greenbrier tips, sheep sorrel, thistle stalks. He learned how to make bamboo-pokeweed spring rolls, persimmon ice cream, spicebush muffins, dandelion jelly, pan-fried groundnuts, watercress soup, acorn cookies, roast squirrel glazed with honey and balsamic vinegar. If a wild hog came onto his property, he killed, butchered, and ate it, then freeze-dried the leftovers. He dried stalks of goldenrod and mint on racks. His interest in flowers led to teasing from “the high testosterone crowd,” he wrote on the BigPig blog, adding, “I have killed wild boar with knives, tracked armed fugitives, and had a couple cage fights, so I feel I have enough ‘man points’ built up to call bullshit.” The average male, he explained, had been culturally conditioned to think that “flowers are for girls, guns and hunting is for guys.” Flowers, he wrote, “are for everyone.” Much of the world’s food supply depends on them.\nDisaster preparedness was also something that Herrington thought about a lot. He encouraged people to store food and water in case of catastrophe: “A trip to Costco can get you 50 pounds of beans and 50 pounds of rice providing 160,000+ calories for around $75.” His intention wasn’t to stoke fear but to promote self-reliance. “If you trace your lineage back,” he wrote, “you won’t have to go far to find members of your family that were living more independently than we do nowadays.”\nHerrington was two years into his “new chapter of life” when he started missing search-and-rescue work. He approached his former boss, Steve Kloster, the Smokies’ chief ranger at the time, with a proposal to support the national park by creating an independent “all hazards” emergency-response team of élite outdoors athletes who were willing to step away from their jobs and families in, say, the middle of the night, or on a holiday, and in weather that you wouldn’t let your dog out in, to save the life of a stranger. They would train for the gnarliest missions: swift-water rescue, long-distance carry-outs, winter rescue, and technical rescue, which involves complex systems of ropes, pulleys, and carabiners. Herrington wanted to name the team BUSAR, for Backcountry Unit Search and Rescue. Kloster liked the idea. He asked Herrington how he planned to keep his guys motivated. Herrington told him, “Leave that to me.”\nOther members came by word of mouth, and occasionally by happenstance. Dee, the family physician, had no formal connection to the park, though he and his wife, Whitney, a pediatrician, avidly hiked there with their four children. The Dees live in Maryville, which, like Gatlinburg, is one of the park’s “gateway” communities. One day, in 2019, Dee, who’s in his mid-forties, was on Facebook and clicked on an image of a waterfall, which took him to BUSAR’s page. A recruitment poster, whose language Herrington had borrowed from an apocryphal Ernest Shackleton ad, read “Experienced outdoor athletes wanted for hazardous work. No wages. Long hours. Adverse weather. High level of fitness required.” The team worked out together every Tuesday evening near Dee’s home. A photo showed a couple dozen men and women in matching neon-yellow gear, standing resolutely on a mountaintop. “Something inside me kind of leapt,” he told me.\nDee had no spare time. But, after three days of being unable to stop thinking about “rescuing people in the woods,” he e-mailed the address on the Facebook account, writing, “I don’t know anything about search and rescue, but the idea of crawling through the mountains, rescuing people, really appeals to me.” Herrington invited Dee out to eat with some of the team, and when that went well he invited him to a workout.\nHerrington and his teammates designed their workouts to be brutal—every BUSAR I’ve met has confessed to craving what one called “purposeful shared suffering.” A team member would concoct an exercise; the rest would do it. The exercises mimicked the demands of difficult backcountry missions. Someone who could walk up and over a picnic table for thirty minutes, wearing a twenty-pound pack, with a fifty-pound sandbag slung over his shoulder, would likely be able to help tote a rescue litter, even if, as once happened, the patient weighed four hundred pounds.\nThe fittest park rangers could do that, too; there simply weren’t enough of them. A tricky rescue may warrant dozens of people, possibly more than are on duty and available at any given time. The Park Service required that a ranger assigned to “arduous” duty be able to walk three miles on flat ground, carrying a forty-five-pound pack, in less than forty-five minutes. The arduous pack test was how BUSARs warmed up. Herrington told me, “In ten minutes, I can gauge whether a candidate has the mental and physical fortitude to do this job. There’s a certain personality that that appeals to.”\nMost of Dee’s strength was in his lower body—he’s an ardent road cyclist. He had no trouble passing the pack hike or the picnic-table exercise, or, as BUSAR’s fitness test also required, completing at least fifteen two-hundred-and-twenty-five-pound dead lifts within a minute. Then came the burpee pullups.\nA burpee pullup entails lying belly flat, popping straight up and into a pullup—chin above the bar, please; none of that Marjorie Taylor Greene fish-flop flailing around—and then dropping back to the belly, in one fluid motion. The exercise works all the major muscles. The BUSAR test called for fifty burpee pullups within ten minutes—while wearing a twenty-pound pack. Dee failed. He went home devastated. His wife told him, “Johnny, I’m just gonna say it. You need to train and do what it takes to pass this test, because I’ve never seen anything light you up like this has.”\nDee trained for months. When his family vacationed in the backcountry of Alaska, he took rubber resistance bands. “We’re in the middle of nowhere, and I’m wrapping them around trees,” he told me. He passed the second tryout and became a BUSAR. “I started from absolute zero and just ate it up,” he said. He developed such an aptitude for technical rescue that he now teaches the subject for the national parks. Last spring, when the Smokies’ longtime medical director retired, the park asked Dee, who by then was BUSAR’s vice-president, to replace him. He agreed on the condition that, during SAR missions, he be considered “one of the grunts.” Working search and rescue reminded him of the decision that he and his wife made to become foster parents, and then adoptive parents, after they’d had two biological children of their own: it felt like the right thing to do.\nFunding and staffing aren’t keeping pace with the popularity of the parks, which hit a record three hundred and thirty-two million recreational visits in 2024. By the end of that year, there was a twenty-three-billion-dollar maintenance backlog. Then, in 2025, the Park Service lost twenty-four per cent of its permanent staff; at least a thousand positions were slashed by the Department of Government Efficiency. “This isn’t becoming more ‘efficient,’ ” Phil Francis, who for eight years served as the Smokies’ deputy superintendent and for three as acting superintendent, told me. “The staff can’t do as much as they once did, because there’s just not as many of them.” He described what is happening to the national parks as “death by a thousand cuts.”\nThe most recent shutdown of the federal government was also the longest: October 1st to November 12th. President Donald Trump insisted that the national parks remain open—at least skeletally. The National Parks Conservation Association declared that the Administration “considerably exacerbated” the Park Service’s resource crisis by “pushing remaining staff to their limits.” The looming threat of a full shutdown hit the Smokies just in time for leaf-peeping season and fall break, a particularly busy period that helps local businesses survive through the winter. Tourists spend $2.2 billion annually in the area, making the Smokies, according to Forbes, the most economically valuable of the national parks. A consortium that included Sevier County, the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians, and a prominent nonprofit, Friends of the Smokies, stepped in and kept the park running.\nThe Smokies, which was established in 1934, has never imposed an entrance fee, but in 2023 it started charging for parking—five dollars a day, forty for the year. The fee generates five million dollars annually. Some of the proceeds were used to create a Preventative Search and Rescue team, or PSAR, which has seven full-time positions. These rangers educate visitors about avoidable behaviors that may, in turn, trigger a SAR mission, which can be risky and expensive. (Between 2019 and 2023, the Park Service spent twenty-two million dollars on search and rescue. Rescuees aren’t asked to pay anything, even when carelessness or ignorance caused the problem.) I spent the better part of one autumn day watching Joshua Albritton, the Smokies’ PSAR chief, genially engage with dozens of hikers on Alum Cave Trail, a popular five-and-a-half-mile route that leads to a backcountry lodge. He’d ask if they had enough water, and how far they planned to walk. Just above a steep, winding staircase at Arch Rock, a picturesque landmark about a mile and a half in, he told a family with small children, “The terrain gets a lot more difficult at this point, just for your information.”\nWhen the park needs rescue help, it issues a callout to a local emergency-services network, which includes BUSAR, whose members receive mission requests in a Signal chat that Herrington set up. More than half of the search-and-rescue workers who show up for the most trying missions are BUSARs. Currently, there are nineteen of them, all men. Herrington leads the recruiting, and encourages nicknames. Big Bill is Bill Ivey, a Smokies wildlife ranger and a marine reservist who is six feet six. Jernigan is Jernigator, who, this year, at age fifty-five, left his software career to become a wilderness E.M.T. and a park ranger, the life he’d wanted all along. Captain Morgan is Andrew Morgan, a physician’s assistant and a former member of the Army Special Forces. Superman is Ken Miller, a retired surgeon who serves with nine local, state, and federal SAR organizations but—so goes a joke—assures his wife that he belongs to only one. (Several years ago, when Miller turned eighty, the guys were so excited about throwing him a surprise party that they forgot to invite him.) Lando, Ben Landkammer, grew up in Montana and trains canines. Silkwood, Mark Silkwood, is also ex-Special Forces, and an Army contractor. Cody Watson, BUSAR’s quartermaster, recently retired early from the Air National Guard; he’s an E.M.T., as is John Danner. Zack Copeland, who chairs BUSAR’s board, is a former wildlife biologist turned poultry farmer. Howitzer, Andrew Howe, is a civil engineer and a competitive mountain biker. Kelly Street is a Knoxville lawyer and a former military-intelligence officer. Caleb Edmiston is a chiropractor who, like Herrington, has competed in mixed martial arts. Greg Grieco played football at the University of Tennessee and now runs a nonprofit that rescues bear cubs. Obi-Wad, Jeff Wadley—a pastor, an author, and a former Civil Air Patrol officer who’s been working SAR missions in the Smokies for more than forty-five years—teaches courses on “lost-person behavior” and may be the greatest living expert on airplane crashes in the park. Daz, Andrew Randazzo, started a company that provides continuing education for medical-industry professionals; he did emergency-response work in New York City during the COVID-19 outbreak, and near the border of Syria and Turkey after the earthquakes in 2023. Ski is Brian Borkowski, who flies Black Hawk helicopters for the Tennessee Army National Guard.\nSharbs is a critical-care flight medic for the Guard. He’s often the guy at the end of Ski’s rescue cable. BUSAR’s unofficial motto, “Right foot!,” derives from “RTFOOT,” an acronym inspired by a response that Sharbs once gave when a teammate asked how a mission had turned out: “Rescued the fuck out of them.” Every prospective member of BUSAR must pass Herrington’s winter-survival class. The final exam requires students to build a fire in the woods after having been submerged in a frigid creek. BUSARs have been known to retake the course for fun.\nThe Smokies, like other national parks, pays some outside search-and-rescue forces an hourly wage, ranging from about twenty-five to thirty-three dollars. But a third of BUSARs take no pay at all, and the income is so negligible that Herrington doesn’t mention it when he recruits. “Here’s the thing,” he told me. “My guys don’t have to be here. They’re here because they want to be.”\nBUSARs always roll for a child, or for someone with dementia. Most members have a spouse or kids at home. Big Bill’s wife, Jennie Ivey, a professor of equine nutrition and exercise physiology at the University of Tennessee’s Institute of Agriculture, told me that her husband got involved in BUSAR when their children were little: “It was, like, ‘What do you mean you need to go out again? It’s a volunteer thing!’ But it was really meaningful for Bill to find that community. And to know that you’re giving back? If our kids were hurt, I’d want somebody to go.”\nPeyton landed about twenty feet below, on a narrow rock ledge. Huber clawed through underbrush to reach her. She was bleeding from a gash in her head, but she was conscious. She told her dad, “I’m sorry!” He told her, “You’re alive!” Her left wrist was broken; her left femur had snapped. The femur is the human body’s longest, strongest bone, and among the most agonizing to break. Peyton kept saying, “I want to die!”\nHuber sent Lauren up the mountain, to try for a cellphone signal. He knew that he had to get Peyton away from the water, to keep her dry and warm. Even in temperate conditions, trauma can cause hypothermia. (Organs shut down as the body loses heat; think of a person walking through a house, turning off the lights.) “I’m going to have to carry you,” Huber told Peyton. When he picked her up by the armpits—“like Simba in ‘The Lion King,’ ” she told me—she could see the grotesque deformity of her leg, which was “dangling.”\nHuber carried Peyton off the ledge and into the woods, about ten feet away. He used some of their drinking water to clean her head wound. Beyond that, there wasn’t much that he could do but hold her head in his lap, tell her to take deep breaths, and play Kenny Chesney songs on his phone. Lauren came back. She’d been able to call 911. “They’re on their way, but it’s going to be forever,” she told her dad and sister. “They have to assemble a team.”\nEvery search-and-rescue mission begins with an investigation. Who needs help and why? Where are they, or where were they last seen? How old are they? What kind of physical shape are they in? What are they carrying? The incident commander—always a park ranger—may order a “hasty,” in which a scout, or two, gets on scene, assesses the situation, and radios out details that will help determine the size and nature of the response. Sharbs did the hasty for Peyton. He crawled through stinging nettles to where she lay, beside a log. When he saw the waterfall, he considered her lucky for having landed where she did. If she’d missed the ledge, she’d have been “deader ’n Dillinger,” he told me. He zipped Peyton into an emergency blanket and started an I.V. He was authorized by radio to administer the maximum amount of painkillers for her size and age. Huber told me, “It was still never enough.”\nThere’s a saying in SAR: rescue is not imminent. Park staff and outside search-and-rescue workers may be busy on other calls, or they may have to drive all the way around, or through, the park just to reach the staging area and start hiking in. Peyton’s team eventually arrived with a Stokes basket, a lipped titanium litter that has netting and straps to secure a body during difficult transport. They wore helmets and carried ropes and harnesses, and their waistbands were racked with carabiners and gloves.\nThe team decided that the best way out was down the front of the waterfall. Huber watched them unfurl ropes and design rigging, later describing the system to me as “this contraption that they created on the fly.” Tech rescue, in fact, requires considerable—and consistent—practice. I recently spent a day watching one such practice at Newfound Gap, a scenic overlook where President Franklin D. Roosevelt formally dedicated the Smokies, in September, 1940. Two dozen rangers, BUSARs, and park volunteers situated themselves on a service road flanked by a steep wooded slope above and another below. At the direction of Albritton, the PSAR chief, the teams mountain-goated up and down the pitches, which were slick with autumn leaves. They brushed up on the alpine-butterfly knot, the Prusik, the figure eight, the Distel hitch. In one drill, several team members stood forty yards upslope, pulling, as others below guided and balanced a silicone dummy in a litter. “Ready to haul!” the person at the bottom would yell. Someone positioned roughly mid-slope would repeat, “Ready to haul!”\n\nAt one point, Albritton announced a hypothetical: a broken femur. The team fitted a dummy with a traction splint. Ethan Schwartz, a park ranger and an E.M.T. who’d been telling us about having lived in a South American rain forest where he adopted a howler monkey named Paula, explained, to newer members, “We’re preventing increasing muscle contractions and spasms that would cause the sharp, severed bone to puncture the femoral artery.” A patient can bleed to death without the bone ever breaking the skin.\nA traction splint can ease the pain. This proved untrue for Peyton. As the team lowered her down the waterfall, buckled into her litter, the basket unavoidably bumping the rock wall, she screamed repeatedly at Sharbs, “I hate you, John!,” which even her horrified father had to admit was kind of funny. Sharbs later told me, “I was, like, ‘Yeah, I get it. I’m causing you a lot of pain right now. But we’re also saving your life. So suck it up, buttercup.’ ”\nIt got dark. Peyton’s rescuers turned on their headlamps. They mounted her litter on a large treaded wheel and, where they could, rolled her through the forest, which resounded with crickets and frogs. They inched her across a rushing creek, on a log bridge barely as wide as the litter, and, ultimately, to a waiting ambulance, which took her to a medevac chopper.\nPeyton had been asking if she’d be able to go to soccer practice on Monday. “No, honey,” Sharbs told her. She missed her freshman year of play but started, as a goalie, for her remaining three years of high school, setting Tennessee’s state record for shutouts. She now starts for Liberty University. In 2025, she was named her conference’s Goalkeeper of the Year. When I called her family, in November, Peyton’s team had just won the conference championship and was en route to the N.C.A.A. tournament.\nGray spent so much time in the backcountry alone that he carried a personal SOS beacon. But the beacon was in his backpack, which he’d left at the bottom of the falls. He later recalled “negotiating” with himself about when to become conscious. One half of his brain would say to the other, Are you ready?, and the other half would answer, No. “At the moment I said yes, all of the pain and the noise and the sight flooded in,” he told me. He was able to tell his wife how to activate the SOS beacon.\nTwo BUSARs—Jernigan and Lando—arrived with a park ranger, followed by Herrington and several others. Somehow, Gray had wound up in the water; his veins had contracted to the point that the ranger, who was a paramedic, couldn’t place an I.V. for painkillers. A needle had to be jammed directly into Gray’s shin.\nI’d been trying to meet up with Gray when Herrington, Jernigan, and I happened to run into him one night at Peaceful Side Social, a restaurant in Townsend. Gray and a friend, and their husky mixes, were finishing dinner at a picnic table. “Last time I saw you, you were—I was the guy that had the plastic over you,” Herrington told him. “We made a little plastic tent to keep you warm, because you were getting hypothermic.”\n“I was in the river for three hours!” Gray said.\nGray, who is in his early sixties, with silver hair and a perpetual tan, grew up in Nashville. He changed his name from Scott to Nadi after spending time in India, where he travels for work. He described himself to us as an experienced outdoorsman, and said that whenever he went ice kayaking he’d make himself swim, to remind his brain that his body could “handle” the cold.\n“You probably don’t remember, but I was setting up a rope system,” Herrington told him.\n“I do remember! And I was terrified!” Gray said. He had fallen in what he called a deep “slot” in the earth. The SAR team planned to raise him up enough that he could be carried out via a manway. “I was terrified because—have you ever broken a rib?” Gray asked us. (He had broken seven.) “This arm? Completely tore away from my clavicle and shoulder. I had bleeding in my lungs. My pelvis wasn’t broken, but it really was not happy. Burst eardrum. Sprained wrist.” The Tennessee Army National Guard ended up sending a Black Hawk and dropping a long hoist cable. Gray remembered a flight medic standing over him “like a Stormtrooper.”\nThe day after we saw Gray, I visited him at home. He was living in a campground on the peaceful side, in an elegantly outfitted Airstream, next to a well-organized trailer stocked with outdoors gear. The Airstream had a Kamala Harris decal on the back. This had cost Gray a couple of friendships in the campground. He didn’t mind.\nOver coffee, he told me about his YouTube channel, where he pairs meditations and poems that he’s written with footage shot in national parks, and he showed me his collection of first-edition books by John Muir, and some of the tchotchkes that he’d brought home from his travels: rocks, river glass, a tiny Buddha. “I tell people, ‘Every year, you should find yourself in a place where you are completely naked in the wild. The first time you do it, be somewhere where there’s no chance anybody will see you. You will discover how completely out of your element you are,’ ” he said. “When I go out into the wild by myself, it’s not because I want to be naked. It’s because I want to know who I am.”\nIt worried Gray that digitalization was creating an “alternative reality.” He went on, “And people rely on it! If it ever breaks, the true crisis of society will be people not having any capability to cope. We have to accept that it’s going to be non-governmental approaches that solve problems. BUSAR is a perfect example. Most people don’t know about the cuts to the parks, because, on the surface, the Interior Secretary has said, ‘Keep the window dressing, everybody! Keep the buses and trains running.’ Yet they’re cutting the biologists and the rangers. People that maintain trails in the backcountry are unheralded—they go out with chainsaws, and on horseback, and clear trees and repair trails. If you don’t have that, what happens within a generation is that the park falls apart.”\nOne Saturday in mid-November, Team BUSAR convened in the woods in Tallassee, Tennessee, just outside the park, on the peaceful side, for a quarterly training. A friend of Herrington’s lets him use private land for that and for BigPig’s classes. Training lasts all day, and, afterward, anyone who wants to camp spends the night. It was just after nine in the morning when I got there and parked on a dead-end dirt road, behind BUSAR’s equipment trailer. To the right, flat ground fronted a creek; to the left rose steep woodland. Twenty yards up a visible manway stood a semi-open tepee structure cloaked by a salvaged parachute. There was seating around a fire pit. At the manway’s entrance, a rope swing hung like a storybook doorbell.\nSeveral BUSARs had already set up tents; Sharbs brought a one-person cot pod. My tent got pitched near the creek. At the other end of camp loomed a gigantic khaki military tent, which Watson and Herrington had erected the previous day so that the team’s children could bunk together. Herrington collectively calls them cobra kids—the cobra is a BUSAR symbol. The kids ranged in age from four to twelve; the military tent was soon being referred to as the Thunderdome, so constant was the ruckus.\nWatson unpacked tables and chairs and a grill and coolers and butane cannisters and groceries and ice. Copeland, who competes in chili cook-offs, got ready to make a huge pot of chili. The forecast called for overnight temperatures in the low forties and little to no rain. Sharbs told me that at the last quarterly training it had “monsooned.” Training, like searches and rescues, happens in every kind of weather.\nAround midafternoon, after refreshers on tech rescue, land navigation, and tracking, the BUSARs loaded into vehicles and were driven a couple of miles away. They were dropped off with instructions to hike, in pairs, to predetermined coördinates in the forest, where they would find Herrington playing the part of a schoolteacher who’d fallen ill while leading an elementary-school field trip.\nHerrington and eight kids and I walked to the designated point, to wait. He told the children not to be alarmed when he started acting “out of it.” As the first pair of yellow helmets appeared in the forest—Captain Morgan and Kelly Street—Herrington curled into the fetal position and went silent, shivering.\nCap knelt beside him and checked his vital signs. Street asked the kids the patient’s name, and the kids, giggling, said, “Mrs. Herrington!” Cap pulled a BUSAR beanie from his pack and put it on Herrington’s head. Street took out an emergency blanket, and he and Cap wrapped Herrington in it, insulating him from the “cold” ground. Street turned and said, “All right, kids, can y’all help me collect some dry sticks?”\nSharbs and Lando arrived, with Lando’s working canine, Kato, a German shepherd who wore a BUSAR harness and yellow-rimmed goggles. Street, kneeling two feet away from Herrington’s calves, constructed a small cone of twigs. As he worked, he kept up the act with the kids: “Where’re you from?” They replied, “BUSAR Academy.”\nStreet built the fire the way Herrington had taught everyone, using tinder, fatwood, and Vaseline-soaked cotton balls, hit with a spark from a ferro rod. Every BUSAR carries personal fire-starter kits and a twenty-five-pound pack filled with gear: headlamps, extra batteries, survival blanket, chem light, grid reader, pens, hemostatic gauze, trash bag, dry bag, gaiters, gloves, spork, M.R.E.s, flagging tape, two types of tourniquets, HotHands, 550 cord, multi-tool, folding saw, microspikes. Showing me all of this one day, Sharbs held up a small item and told me what Herrington had told him: “This is the best fire starter in the history of man.” It was a Bic lighter.\nJernigan and Daz arrived. They strung a tarp, on paracord, at an angle between trees, sheltering Herrington and the fire. Watson played dispatcher: “BUSAR One, Seven Hundred.”\n“Seven Hundred, this is BUSAR One,” Cap said.\n\n“We have a fifty-year-old female, presently hypothermic.”\n“Location?”\nSharbs read off their coördinates, which he’d written in a field notebook.\nShelter in place overnight, dispatch instructed. Within minutes, makeshift structures mushroomed in the woods.\nThe sun was setting. The kids were getting punchy. As Watson casually quizzed them about hypothermia, one mentioned an insect that “climbs up your pants and bites your balls.” Watson, suppressing a laugh, said, “Stop it, watch your mouth.”\nHerrington came out of character and lay flat on his back with both hands behind his head as if at home on the sofa, watching a football game. He looked so cozy next to the fire that the kids clamored to get under the shelter with him. Then he jumped up, assessed the BUSARs’ shelters one by one, and said, “All right, break it down!”\nAs Street dismantled his setup, I asked him why he’d joined BUSAR. He told me that he’d served in the Army from 1995 to 2005, then got out, got married, went to law school, had kids. “What I realized as I got into my forties was that I wasn’t done serving,” he said. “So this scratches that itch. It’s really low on bullshit, and I enjoy being a part of something that’s useful.” Glancing at his teammates, he said, “I’m surrounded by people who are useful.” Then he showed Miller and me the logger’s knot that his granddaddy had taught him in childhood.\nHalf the team stayed to camp. We made a fire at the tepee, drank beer, and stayed up late. Lando described the quarterly trainings and campouts as BUSAR’s “sinew.” They were still processing their most harrowing rescue in recent memory, which began on September 27, 2024, the day that Hurricane Helene reached the Smokies. An SOS beacon from a personal device pinged 911, alerting rangers to a crisis at Tricorner Knob, where a diabetic hiker was gravely sick, and deteriorating. Hiking to Tricorner takes at least four hours—in good weather. As in much of the park, all-terrain vehicles are of no use, because the trails are so rugged and narrow. Choppers couldn’t penetrate the cloud cover. The trail was a river. The Tricorner mission lasted thirty-six hours and required dozens of people. “Everybody was smoked,” Big Bill told me. When he got home, he fell asleep eating a burrito.\nIn search and rescue, a mission may require a body bag. Corpse recovery is part of the job. The Tricorner hiker survived. He reached out to the park, to say thanks. SAR workers rarely hear from the people they save, or even learn whether they ultimately survive, or how their lives turn out. I did hear about a guy who got rescued in 1974 and whose mother took a poinsettia to park headquarters every Christmas thereafter until she died, in 2020. Now the son delivers the poinsettia.\nDuring the campfire portion of BUSAR’s quarterly training, Herrington sometimes asks his teammates to throw written questions into a hat. Everyone is expected to answer. Tell us about your craziest rescue. Tell us your worst memory from childhood. Copeland once said that BUSARs tend to be “first responders, military, and former athletes with a smattering of childhood trauma.” Herrington told me that members join “for whatever reason, but they all stay for the brotherhood.” When one member deployed to Kosovo, the others mowed his family’s grass. When Herrington was juggling a divorce, a sick parent, and a busted transmission, the team pooled money to help him pay legal bills. The memory still choked him up. “In my dad’s era,” he told me, “the only emotion you were allowed to express as a man was anger.”\nThe kids were up at daybreak, congregating beneath the parachute, having already swung on the rope swing, picked on one another, cried a little, and gotten into a cooler of sodas. One was eating sour cream and shredded cheddar for breakfast until a dog slurped it off her plate. Another made a “rifle” out of duct tape and sticks. Two had turned huge dried leaves into “fairy hats.”\nWatson cooked scrambled eggs and bacon. Daz made coffee. Lando had gone home to get Koa, his Belgian Malinois puppy, whom he kept on a leash. (“He does bite work.”) The head of Sharbs’s cot pod had collapsed overnight, and he’d gone on sleeping, at an angle, with one hairy bare leg protruding from the zipper. When he emerged, he told us about having been attacked by a donkey and a rooster, in separate incidents, which led somebody to suggest that he reëxamine his relationship to nature. The group had planned to jump off a bridge and into a river—one kid said, “Good, now I’ll know what hypothermia feels like”—but time ran out. Watson had an ambulance shift; a couple of kids had wrestling matches. Before breaking camp, the fathers and their children lined up in a row, like a ground-search team, and walked forward together, scanning for forgotten items and trash.\nHerrington has long admired a passage from a book called “Last Child in the Woods,” by Richard Louv: “Passion is lifted from the earth itself by the muddy hands of the young; it travels along grass-stained sleeves to the heart.” He and Sharbs often talked about how cool it would be if even one cobra kid grew up to become a BUSAR. The Smokies weren’t going anywhere. The week after we left the woods, a woman who lived in one of the gateway communities was driving to her bank job when a bald eagle dropped a cat through her windshield. A three-hundred-and-seventy-five-pound bear got stuck on the roof of Ripley’s Motion Blaster. The bear survived; Big Bill participated in the rescue. The cat had run out of lives. ♦","summary":"In the Great Smoky Mountains, an auxiliary team of élite outdoorsmen answers the call when park-goers’ hikes, climbs, and rafting adventures go wrong.","url":"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2026/01/19/the-backcountry-rescue-squad-at-americas-busiest-national-park","image":"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/695ea7e01602f408aa0eefc5/16:9/w_2560,h_1440,c_limit/r48296.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-12 11:00:00","author":"Paige Williams","authors":["Paige Williams"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.137},{"id":392474058,"title":"Mary Peltola, Barrier-Breaking Ex-Alaska Congresswoman, Is Challenging Dan Sullivan in Senate Race","text":"JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) — Democratic former U.S. Rep. Mary Peltola said Monday that she would challenge Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan in this year’s midterm elections, vowing to shake up the establishment to make life more affordable for Alaskans.\n\n“Life is difficult here, and we know that we have to take care of each other,” Peltola said in a video announcement.\n\nPeltola, who is Yup’ik, was the first Alaska Native to serve in Congress. She won special and regular elections in 2022, defeating a field that included Republican former Gov. Sarah Palin. In 2024, she lost to Republican Nick Begich, who had also run in 2022.\n\nPeltola’s time in Congress was marked by tragedy. Her mother died in 2023, and her husband died in a plane crash later that year.\n\nPeltola focused on local concerns in her announcement, saying Alaska’s future depends on fixing the “rigged system in D.C. that’s shutting down Alaska, while politicians feather their own nests.”\n\nShe said the salmon and migratory birds that once filled the freezers of Alaska Native subsistence hunters are now harder to find, forcing families who live far from the state’s limited road system to rely on grocery stores for pricey staples, driven up by high transportation costs.\n\n“It’s not just that politicians in D.C. don’t care that we’re paying $17 for a gallon of milk in rural Alaska,” she said. “They don’t even believe us. They’re more focused on their stock portfolios than our bank accounts.”\n\nAlthough Democrats are hopeful about picking up seats in this year’s midterms, Alaska could prove to be difficult political terrain. Sullivan, a former state attorney general and natural resources commissioner, defeated the state’s last Democratic senator in 2014.\n\nWhile serving in Washington, Sullivan has been involved in military and resource development issues, and he was endorsed by then-President Donald Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nPeltola has long touted her ability to work across party lines, such as supporting the large Willow oil project on Alaska’s North Slope. She angered some Democrats in 2024 when she refused to endorse then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race won by Trump.\n\nPeltola said Alaska’s Republican congressional delegation used to ignore partisanship and do what was right for the state, such as backing public media and disaster relief, and even invoked Republican former Sen. Ted Stevens.\n\n“It’s about time Alaskans teach the rest of the country what Alaska First and, really, America First looks like,” Peltola said.\n\nAlaska has open primaries and ranked choice voting in general elections. The top four vote-getters in the August primary regardless of party affiliation will advance to the November general election.\n\nBy BECKY BOHRER and MARK THIESSEN Associated Press\nThiessen reported from Anchorage, Alaska.","url":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/mary-peltola-barrier-breaking-ex-alaska-congresswoman-is-challenging-dan-sullivan-in-senate-race/","image":"https://www.thenationalherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26011486023368-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-12 10:11:45","author":"Achilleas Kouremenos","authors":["Achilleas Kouremenos"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.326},{"id":392475774,"title":"Warren Warns Fellow Democrats Not To Kowtow To Donors","text":"WASHINGTON ― Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) issued a stark warning to her fellow Democrats on Monday: If you listen to donors and corporate interests more than the public, the party’s 2026 and 2028 comeback bids will fall short. \n\nWarren delivered a speech Monday at the National Press Club in Washington, laying out her vision for the Democratic Party and arguing that the party is in danger of letting major donors and corporations dictate its agenda. She said the party needs to wholeheartedly embrace systemic change to what many voters increasingly see as a rigged economic system. \n\n“Revising our economic agenda to tiptoe around that conclusion might appeal to the wealthy, but it will not help Democrats build a bigger tent, and it definitely will not help Democrats win elections,” Warren said. “A Democratic Party that worries more about offending big donors than delivering for working people is a party that is doomed to fail ― in 2026, 2028 and beyond.”\n\nThe speech called out not only the Wall Street and tech CEOs who are the presumed targets of Warren’s rhetoric, but also key Democratic leaders and a trendy intellectual movement. \n\nWarren’s advice to her fellow Democrats is likely to be met by eyerolls from many in the party who do not believe a Massachusetts liberal understands the compromises necessary to win in swing states. At the same time, many moderate and electorally focused voices ― like longtime party strategist James Carville, whom Warren shouts out in her speech ― have come to agree with her argument that the party’s economic message needs to be bolder and more populist.\n\n“But in the long run, to build a strong Democratic Party with a sturdy big tent, it is not enough to simply attack Trump,” Warren said. “Democrats need to earn trust — long-term, durable trust — across the electorate. Trust that we actually understand what’s broken, and trust that we have the courage to fix it — even when that means taking on the wealthy and well-connected.”\n\nWarren clearly does not believe every member of the party is dedicated to building that trust. Notably, she directly called out the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ― which Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) chairs and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer traditionally plays a major role in running ― for subscribing to a more cautious philosophy she believes has more to do with raising cash than winning over voters.\n\n“A tepid, nibble-around-the-edges approach earns praise from Jamie Dimon and other Wall Street and Big Tech CEOs. And, if we’re being honest, that approach has also been a good way to appeal to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee as they decide which primary candidates they will support,” she said. “But it doesn’t take a political genius to conclude that in a democracy, when the choice is between ‘make the rich richer’ and ‘help everybody else,’ winning elections is about choosing ‘everybody else.’”\n\nAsked for comment, DSCC spokesperson Maeve Coyle said the party has overperformed on the Senate map in the last four election cycles. “The committee has one goal: to win a Democratic Senate majority,” Coyle said. “We’ve created a path to do that this cycle by recruiting formidable candidates and expanding the map, building strong general election infrastructure, and disqualifying Republican opponents.”\n\nWarren is part of a group of liberal Democrats, the self-proclaimed “Fight Club,” that has pushed Schumer to more aggressively respond to President Donald Trump and has pushed back against the DSCC’s involvement in key primaries. Warren herself has endorsed Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan over Rep. Angie Craig in Minnesota’s Senate race. She also sent $400,000 of campaign cash to 23 state parties last week. \n\nThe speech could revive speculation that the 76-year-old senator is considering a presidential run in 2028, but Democrats close to her say she is not going to be a candidate. \n\nAnd while many Democrats believe the party should get more economically populist, Warren dodged when asked whether the party should move to the center on social issues ― the other part of the equation championed by Carville and others.\n\n“I want to be where the American people are right now, and what they’re telling us across the spectrum is that they are under enormous financial pressure,” she said. \n\nShe also repeatedly slammed Trump for failing to live up to his populist promises, arguing he’s letting bipartisan legislation to increase housing supply wither and die and challenging him to work with Democrats on a proposal to cap credit card interest rates. \n\n“At least so far, he hasn’t delivered anything that would take one dollar out of the pocket of a billionaire in America,” she said. \n\n(After the speech, Warren said, Trump called her and offered to work together on credit card interest rate legislation.)\n\nWarren spent a significant chunk of her speech discussing the “Abundance” movement, named after a book by journalists Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson, which argues that Democrats need to focus more on making government work more efficiently to increase the supply of things Americans want, from housing to health care. \n\nThe senator argues she has embraced parts of this agenda with the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, passing legislation to make hearing aids available over the counter and pressing the IRS to create a free direct file program. \n\nBut, she argues, the movement has become cover for billionaires to push the party to the center. “Abundance has become a rallying cry — not just for a few policy nerds worried about zoning, but for wealthy donors and other corporate-aligned Democrats who are putting big-time muscle behind making Democrats more favorable to big businesses,” she said. \n\nThe list of billionaires and business leaders Warren called out in her speech is long: JPMorgan’s Dimon, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, and venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Stripe CEO Patrick Collison.\n\nShe pointed a finger at Hoffman, a major Democratic donor, for advocating the firing of then-Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, noting that former Vice President Kamala Harris never committed one way or the other to keeping Khan. She also argued that Harris undermined her own message on affordability, at the urging of donors, by watering down a plan to go after corporations for price gouging.\n\n“That story of retreat ran just weeks before Democrats lost an election to Donald Trump, who loudly, day after day after day, promised that he would lower costs for families ‘on Day One,’” she said. \n\nWarren’s harshest critique, however, may have been aimed at former Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, a Democrat-turned-independent who helped block many of former President Joe Biden’s policy priorities, including a hike in the minimum wage. Sinema is now working as an advocate for a host of different well-heeled industries, including crypto and AI.\n\nAfter blocking the minimum wage hike, Warren said, Sinema “spent the rest of her time in office protecting hedge fund managers from paying taxes and blocking filibuster reform. Sinema faced no consequences from her President or her leaders in Washington. Eventually, it was her own constituents back home who chased her out of the Senate.”","url":"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/warren-warns-fellow-democrats-not-to-kowtow-to-donors_n_69646364e4b0dfe68aa7ea6f?origin=home-whats-happening-unit","image":"https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/69651b04170000da072ee5de.jpg?ops=1778_1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-12 10:00:17","author":"Kevin Robillard","authors":["Kevin Robillard"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.066},{"id":392475820,"title":"Warren Warns Fellow Democrats Not To Kowtow To Donors","text":"WASHINGTON ― Sen.

Last week’s fatal shooting of Renee Good by an immigration officer in Minneapolis turned the city into a symbol of national resistance to federal immigration enforcement. The tragedy also thrust deteriorating relations between state leaders and President Donald Trump into the spotlight.\n\nState and federal officials say an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot Ms. Good on a residential street during a surge of immigration arrests in the city. Beyond those facts, reaction stands sharply divided: Senior Trump administration officials likened the woman killed to a domestic terrorist and claimed she attempted to kill officers with her car. Minnesota officials vehemently reject that account, arguing video footage shows the U.S. citizen and mother of three tried to leave the scene. The Minneapolis mayor has told ICE to leave, but more federal law enforcement personnel are on their way.\n\nUnder the United States’ federal system, set up by the Constitution, states and the federal government are given their own spheres of influence – and an expectation of collaboration. The friction in Minnesota highlights how, at a time of deep political division, the risks of intensifying confrontations are heightened, analysts say. And the divide is not just among political leaders. In Minneapolis and across the U.S. this weekend, thousands of protesters gathered to honor Ms. Good and decry the administration’s aggressive immigration enforcement tactics – echoing protests in 2020 after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis by a local police officer.\n\n“Certainly Minnesota and the federal government, or the Trump administration, has had some difficulties, but it really seems to have hit an inflection point and heated up,” says Amy Koch, a Republican political strategist and former Minnesota Senate majority leader. “Both sides have become so divided that they can’t even agree on things that seem obvious.”\n\nSeparate investigations into Ms. Good’s death by officials in Washington, D.C., and in Minnesota, breaking from tradition, mirror the split-screen political fissure of the broader United States. The showdown here builds on power struggles between Mr. Trump and other Democratic strongholds, like in California, Illinois, and Oregon, where the administration has sent or attempted to send National Guard troops in recent months.\n\nOn the ground in Minneapolis, the immigration enforcement surge looks disproportionate to the size of the immigrant population, says Ryan Allen, associate dean for research at the University of Minnesota. About 2% of the state’s population is made up of immigrants without legal status, according to the Pew Research Center, much lower than some other states including California, Texas, Florida, and New York.\n\nSanctuary policies versus federal law\n\nYet nationwide, the conflict between federal and local government over immigration has long roots. For decades, Congress has failed to agree on comprehensive policies to address border security and unauthorized immigrants. Some largely Democratic states and cities, Minneapolis among them, developed what are often called sanctuary policies for immigrants.\n\nIn turn, the Trump administration has targeted those states and cities, with Minnesota in its sights long before this winter. Sanctuary status lacks a firm definition, but suggests a city, county, or state that limits cooperation with federal immigration enforcement. In Minneapolis, one recently revised city ordinance underscores the tension. The policy says no government entity is authorized to use city-owned parking lots, vacant lots, or garages for immigration operations.\n\nStill, ICE has law-enforcement allies in the state. Out of Minnesota’s 87 counties, seven sheriffs have cooperative agreements with the agency, which deputize state and local law enforcement for certain immigration actions. Those seven counties voted for Mr. Trump in 2024, and inked their ICE agreements after his return.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mr. Trump has also pledged to target Minnesota over pandemic-era fraud in social services programs, over which several people of Somali descent have been convicted or charged. A top U.S. prosecutor estimates fraud from Medicaid programs in the state could top $9 billion. After the yearslong fraud investigations resurfaced through right-wing media attention, the Department of Homeland Security announced plans to send 2,000 federal agents to the state in early January.\n\nWhile the state’s Somali population was impacted by a travel ban under Mr. Trump’s first term, the current crackdown in Minneapolis is a “much more focused attention that has been, if anything, ramped up over the past month,” Professor Allen says.\n\nA divide over the shooting investigation\n\nOne sign of the breakdown in trust is the dissolution of a partnership between state and federal officials on investigating Ms. Good’s death.\n\nMinnesota investigators initially worked on the case of Ms. Good’s shooting in collaboration with federal investigators. But that process halted, according to the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, which said the FBI would take over the investigation. The state and Hennepin County, which includes Minneapolis, have put out calls to crowdsource evidence for their own investigation.\n\nData sharing is a key part of federal-state cooperation, says Paul Nolette, professor of political science at Marquette University. The absence of that sharing, in the Good case, “really is an escalation of tensions,” he says.\n\n“Typically the baseline, regardless of the administration, usually is cooperation,” says Dr. Nolette. That means “state and federal agencies – as well as local agencies and prosecutors – working to build cases against the accused and carry out justice.”\n\nAt an anti-ICE march in Minneapolis on Saturday, where thousands faced subfreezing temperatures, a woman named Sarah called for the state’s Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to be included by the FBI in the shooting investigation. The high school teacher, like others interviewed, declined to share her full name for privacy concerns.\n\n“When we all stand together, it feels really powerful,” Sarah says as the chanting crowd passes by.\n\nSome Minnesotans worry about how to address fraud – and keep people safe amid the federal-state tension.\n\nIn a parking lot in Blaine, a suburb north of Minneapolis, a man named Tim says he is concerned about fraud in the state, and supports more immigrant arrests. “You want to be humanitarian. At the same time, what can we afford?” he asks.\n\nThe Minneapolis shooting last week was “tragic,” says the construction worker who also drives semitrucks, though it seems she “put herself in that situation by interfering and obstructing ICE.” He expects more people to get hurt on “both sides.”\n\nBefore thousands marched Saturday, anti-federal fervor in Minneapolis had turned aggressive late in the week. The city announced an unlawful assembly, with 30 people detained for blocking roads and damaging property downtown. Near the airport, clashes between federal agents and protesters have continued at a federal building.\n\nTrump and Walz at odds since 2024\n\nDisputes between President Trump and Minnesota politicians – including Gov. Tim Walz – aren’t new.\n\nThe May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer – about a mile from Ms. Good’s killing – sparked countrywide protests and a national reckoning over race. Local demonstrations at times turned violent, with arson, looting, and property damage, which Mr. Trump and fellow Republicans condemned. Governor Walz declared a “peacetime emergency” at the time and called up the Minnesota National Guard. In recent days, the governor asked those service members to prepare in case they’re tapped again.\n\nIn 2024, Mr. Trump and Governor Walz faced off on the campaign trail, with Vice President Kamala Harris picking Mr. Walz as her running mate. Mr. Trump has repeatedly called the governor incompetent.\n\nGovernor Walz has taken heat for calling immigration officers “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo.” The administration says such language incites violence, and affirms agents’ use of masks to hide their faces.\n\n“The vice president candidate usually becomes the chief attack dog. And so Governor Walz started doing that job,” says Ms. Koch. “Postelection, Governor Walz continued to be a really vocal, outspoken detractor of this administration.”\n\nIn June, political violence rocked the state with the fatal shooting of Minnesota’s Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, along with her husband. A Democratic state senator and his wife were also shot. President Trump, himself a survivor of political assassination attempts, posted a conspiracy video insinuating the governor’s involvement in Ms. Hortman’s death, which her children have asked the president to remove.\n\nFederal action meets grassroots activism\n\nThe White House has seized before on serious but isolated incidents involving immigrant suspects to justify crackdowns on broader groups. In Minnesota, federal goals include investigating people for fraudulently acquired lawful status, including some admitted as refugees.\n\nMeanwhile, grassroots anti-Trump activism has surged in response to more immigration enforcement in Minnesota, including information networks on federal sightings, anti-ICE signs at businesses, and meal deliveries to families who fear leaving home. While local activists have learned from other cities responding to upticks in immigrant arrests, Minneapolis also has experience building organizing networks around the protests of 2020, says Professor Allen.\n\n“I think part of what we’re seeing is a reliance on some of that knowledge and infrastructure that has been built over a number of years,” he says.\n\nSome efforts are more recent. The nonprofit COPAL, an advocacy group for Latino families, started training legal observers, who monitor federal law enforcement, after the 2024 election. The group trained around 400 people the night after Ms. Good’s death. Trainees are told to record arrests in public spaces while keeping several feet from officers, says Francisco Segovia, the executive director.\n\n“We are not going to obstruct or intervene,” he says. Local documentation of Ms. Good’s killing on a residential street proves that videos are key “to make our government accountable,” he says. Activism aside, however, many immigrants live with fear of arrest.\n\n“We know people who have documents, but they are afraid to go out or go to work,” says Mr. Segovia. “The psychological impact of this is huge.”\n\nNationally, beyond scenes of division, Americans may actually want compromise on immigration. Polling suggests strong support for strong border security and easier paths to citizenship for immigrants already here. Last year, concern about immigration’s effects on the U.S. also declined.\n\n“They can’t come out”\n\nHow big a blow Mr. Trump will land in Minnesota remains to be seen. For now, a federal judge in New York has stopped his plan to freeze federal child care funding there and in four other Democrat-led states.\n\nStill, citing fraud concerns and anti-ICE hostility, several agencies are tightening the vise. The Treasury Department has said it will ramp up fraud investigations. The Small Business Administration announced the relocation of its Minneapolis office. And the Agriculture Department pledged to pause financial awards to the city and the state.\n\nOn the ground, immigration arrests continue, with more agents on the way. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem announced Sunday that “hundreds” more federal officers were headed to Minnesota to boost the safety of officers already present. Many lawfully present Minnesotans – and U.S. citizens – carry their passport or other paperwork in case officers stop them on the street. Others have retreated from public view.\n\nOn Saturday, a Minneapolis school bus driver named Luis marched alone on his family’s behalf. The U.S. citizen says several loved ones fear arrest.\n\n“My mom, my dad, my nephews, my wife – they’re at home,” says Luis. “They can’t come out.”\n\nStaff writers Caitlin Babcock in Washington and Victoria Hoffmann in Boston contributed to this article.","summary":"Immigration is a federal responsibility, yet opposition to federal enforcement has been rising in some states and cities.

Gen. Rob Bonta opts against running for governor. Again.","text":"California Atty. Gen. Rob Bonta announced Sunday that he would not run for California governor, a decision he said was grounded in his belief that his legal efforts combating the Trump administration as the state's top prosecutor are paramount at this time in history. \"In this moment, my place is here, on the front lines, in the trenches, serving as a bulwark, creating a protection around our state and our people, our values and our progress in the face of these vicious, inhumane, unlawful, cruel attacks from the Trump administration,\" Bonta said in an interview Sunday night. Bonta said his role as state Attorney General affords him greater power to fight President Trump's policies that have disproportionately impacted Californians than he would be able to do as governor. \"I have a role to play that I think is leading in the nation,\" Bonta said. \"I want to continue to be the biggest and most powerful check on the abuse of power from this president.\" Bonta said that Trump's actions in Venezuela, attempts to block welfare funds to Democratic-led states and the fatal shooting of a Minnesota mother of three last week by a federal immigration agent cemented his decision to seek reelection to his current post. The 53-year-old former state lawmaker and close political ally to Gov. Gavin Newsom has served as the state's top law enforcement official since Newsom appointed him to the position in 2021, after Xavier Becerra became then-President Biden's chief of the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services. Bonta's office has sued the Trump administration more than 50 times — a track record that would probably have served him well had he decided to run in a state where Trump has lost three times and has dismal approval ratings. In 2024, Bonta said that he was considering running for governor. Then in February he announced he had ruled it out and was focused instead on doing the job of attorney general. After both former Vice President Kamala Harris and Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) announced in 2025 that they would not run for governor, and Bonta began reconsidering, he said. Bonta's final decision not to run was first reported by Politico on Sunday. \"I had two horses in the governor’s race already,\" Bonta told The Times in November. \"They decided not to get involved in the end. ... The race is fundamentally different today, right?\" The race for California governor remains wide open. Newsom is serving the final year of his second term and is barred from running again because of term limits. Newsom has said he is considering a run for president in 2028. Former Rep. Katie Porter — an early leader in polls — late last year faltered after videos emerged of her screaming at an aide and berating a reporter. The videos contributed to her dropping behind Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco, a Republican, in a November poll released by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies and co-sponsored by The Times. Porter rebounded a bit toward the end of the year, a poll by the Public Policy Institute of California showed, however none of the candidates has secured a majority of support and many voters remain undecided. California hasn't elected a Republican governor since 2006, Democrats heavily outnumber Republicans in the state, and many are seething with anger over Trump and looking for Democratic candidates willing to fight back against the current administration. Labor unions as well as business leaders encouraged Bonta to enter the unsettled race. Bonta said he had no immediate plans to endorse a candidate. \"I think I could have been a game changer, and I think I would have consolidated a lot of support,\" Bonta said. \"I don't know what's going to happen. I think it's still very much dynamic. It's not static, it's in flux. It's moving. It's changing. I think you're going to see potentially more candidates enter the race.\" Bonta has faced questions in recent months about spending about $468,000 in campaign funds on legal advice last year as he spoke to federal investigators about alleged corruption involving former Oakland Mayor Sheng Thao, who was charged in an alleged bribery scheme involving local businessmen David Trung Duong and Andy Hung Duong. All three have pleaded not guilty. According to his political consultant Dan Newman, Bonta — who had received campaign donations from the Duong family — was approached by investigators because he was initially viewed as a \"possible victim\" in the alleged scheme, though that was later ruled out. Bonta has since returned $155,000 in campaign contributions from the Duong family, according to news reports. Bonta is the son of civil rights activists Warren Bonta, a white native Californian, and Cynthia Bonta, a native of the Philippines who immigrated to the U.S. on a scholarship in 1965. Bonta, a U.S. citizen, was born in Quezon City, Philippines, in 1972, when his parents were working there as missionaries, and immigrated with his family to California as an infant. In 2012, Bonta was elected to represent Oakland, Alameda and San Leandro as the first Filipino American to serve in California’s Legislature. In Sacramento, he pursued a string of criminal justice reforms and developed a record as one of the body’s most liberal members. Bonta is married to Assemblywoman Mia Bonta (D-Alameda), who succeeded him in the state Assembly, and the couple have three children.

It’s not just that he’s a fellow Ohioan, though that’s important. It’s not just that he overcame adversity to earn the credentials smug libs treasure and then turned it around and owned said libs. It’s not even that he is cool enough to own his memes and is personable in person – in this gig, I meet a lot of politicians, and far too many of them are mindless automatons who are always spewing clichés and bending with the wind. Not him, and definitely not his wife, who is as bright as she is delightful. It’s not like I pal around with the guy; I’ve met him a couple of times, but he is uniquely impressive. He is impressive enough that I forgive him for being a Marine instead of a veteran of the decisive branch of American military power, the United States Army. And he has been doing an incredible job. He can not only articulate the America First case but prosecute it. That’s why he’s the heir apparent to President Trump – he’s the guy who can take America First to the next level. And this leads me to perhaps the most important reason why I’m such a fan – the media and the Democrats have already started fretting that he’s worse than Donald Trump, that he makes President Trump look like one of the George Bushes.\n\nSign me up. I want JD Vance to be our nominee in 2028.\n\nBut it’s because I am such a JD Vance fanboy, such an unabashed supporter, that I want another quality Republican to primary the hell out of him. I want him to have an opponent who takes off the gloves, gets in the ring, and rumbles with bare knuckles, biting, and hair pulling.\n\nI want JD to head into the convention battered and bloody, tired, and tested. It’s not because I dislike him. It’s because I really like him. And because I really like him, I don’t want a coronation. I want armed combat.\n\nThere are some good reasons to avoid a Republican primary and go with a coronation in 2028. It’s less expensive, in some ways it’s less risky, and it unites the party earlier. But there are better reasons to make JD Vance earn the crown.\n\nRemember the last presidential candidate who got handed the nomination? If you look at some of the polls, she’s the most likely to be the nominee for the Democrats in 2028. Kamala Harris got the nod not by going out there and winning it but by being handed it, in part by her own machinations, but also, in part, by Joe Biden’s last manifestation of conscious action, where he decided to hang that Chardonnay-swilling millstone around the neck of the party that had just fit him with cement overshoes. She ran against Donald Trump, who had been on the campaign trail, who had won a primary, and who was tan, rested, and ready to rock. She wasn’t. She was a mess. She didn’t have an effective organization, she didn’t have the relationships, and she didn’t have the practice. She didn’t have the killer instinct honed by months of political combat against Democrats. She wanted to take the presidency the same way she took the nomination, by default, hoping it could be just handed to her by virtue of who she was. And she was surprised when she found out that she was losing because of who she was. She was surprised because she hadn’t been out there with real voters for years and had no clue that she was repellent to a wide range of normal people, including people who had voted Democrat forever.\n\nI don’t want the first time JD Vance comes up against someone coming at him with a knife in the 2028 campaign to be after the nomination. The guy is a fighter, as he proved by slapping the show tunes out of the mouth of Tim Walz. But even Mike Tyson trained. He sparred. He threw punches and took them. You need that before you enter a general election campaign. A candidate needs to work out the kinks during the primary – obviously, Tim Walz’s kinks are quite different from JD’s, but you get the point. You need to get up to speed in March, when you’re tussling against another Republican. You can’t wait for September, when you are in the midst of the general election. You need to figure out what your weaknesses are and work on them and figure out what your strengths are and how best to exploit them.\n\nAnd it’s not just the candidate, but his organization. You can’t win without a functioning team, and teams take time to build. Some people aren’t going to be able to hack the jobs you give them, and you’re going to have to replace them. All of them have learning curves. Their curves need to be learned well before the home stretch. All cylinders need to be firing when you get that nomination because the clock is ticking, and you must be full steam ahead when facing the general election tsunami of shady foreign billionaire dark money and election fraud, as well as the affluent wine women, race hustlers, welfare cheats, and perverted deviants who are the key constituencies of the Democratic Party.\n\nJD’s strengths are Trump’s track record, his story, and his ability to communicate. His press conference in the wake of the shooting of that poet in Minneapolis was masterful. He demonstrated strength, commitment, and willingness to never play the left’s game. That the regime media hates him is the kind of endorsement any Republican could want. \n\nBut he does have weaknesses. He’s never been an executive, and sorry, being vice president doesn’t count as being an executive. It barely counts as “being” period, though he has managed to do much more than the usual Veep. He’s open to attack because some of his friends have frankly gone nuts, and his loyalty to people who’ve been loyal to him and his refusal to obey demands that he denounce people – I hate that too; I will choose when and how I address friends and other people I disagree with – have gotten him some negative hits from the right. Some call him an antisemite, which is stupid, but it’s out there and the Democrats – who just discovered Hamas is bad – will hit him on it. He’s got to address that somehow, whether he writes those critics off or reassures them. The Democrats are going to call him a “Nazi” regardless, though they’re going to call everybody a “Nazi.” Still, if in 2028 America is powerful again and the economy is cooking, these weaknesses won’t really matter. He will be the avatar of a golden age, and that is probably a golden ticket to the presidency.\n\nBut he still has to get elected, and this is a 50-50 country at the moment. I’d like him to get that primary seasoning, but the question arises of who would challenge the crown prince. After all, everybody is sure that JD is the guy, barring some misfortune that leads to his fall from grace. Anybody risking a race risks exile, because the America First types – being, as they are, the abused women of American politics – are utterly unforgiving of those who fail to meet the MAGA loyalty test. Furthermore, at this point, it looks like a losing battle. The very same things that JD is going to cite to make his case in general, he’s going to cite to make his case in the primary. If the economy is pumping, and America’s enemies are dumping, JD Vance is going to be stumping under the slogan “More of the same, only with fewer tweets about Rosie O’Donnell.” Challengers are always about change; if the Republican general election argument in 2028 is “Don’t Change,” that makes it kind of hard to be a challenger.\n\nThat means there can be two kinds of challengers. The first wants to return the party to the rule of the kind of sexually inadequate Bushies whom we long ago repudiated. But hey, if Mike Pence wants to roll the dice, that’s great. Pence isn’t a dumb guy; he’s just an insufferable sissy, Ned Flanders without the edge. He might be able to provide a little pushback to JD, though if JD slaps him, he’ll probably cry. Also, along these lines is Chris Sununu, another moderate/invertebrate. He could probably win in New Hampshire, which is something. Their argument will be, “Sure, America’s enemies fear us, and everybody’s prosperous, but we need to be more sensitive and soft and feminine because reasons, and oh well, I never.” It’s a bad argument, and it won’t get much traction, but it might provide a nice workout for JD as he pummels them into the preferred state of this kind of gooey Republican: submission.\n\nThe other kind of challenge would be someone coming from the right. But who could do that? Marjorie Taylor Greene? She’s already at about 47 minutes of her 15 minutes of fame.\n\nThe real players probably think this is not their year and will sit it out. Even if Marco Rubio, who has been born again hard after his tragic dalliance with amnesty a decade ago, thought he had a shot this go-round, he’s a key part of this administration, so what’s he going to criticize? Ron DeSantis is a great governor. He might be able to go in arguing that he’s as tough as JD, but that he has extensive executive experience compared to the vice president. I’m not sure how much that’ll matter. And then there’s Ted Cruz. We’ve heard noises that he might think this is his year because he absolutely wants to be president someday. I’ve supported him in the past with money, which is a huge commitment for a guy like me, considering I’m part Scottish. He’s right on policy, though he’s off-putting to a lot of people who confuse politicians with pals. His argument would have to be that he’s going to do what Trump did, but more so. That’s a risky argument because it would allow JD to move to the center of the GOP spectrum, gathering votes from the kind of old-school Republicans who get nervous when people are firm and tough. Yet imagine JD Vance going up against Rubio, DeSantis, and/or Cruz. This would not be iron sharpening iron. This would be diamonds sharpening diamonds. Any of these guys would be an absolute home run as president, and some of them are definitely going to run in the cycles that will follow 2028. \n\nSo, who might jump in and challenge JD this time? Who knows? Regardless, right now the race looks like it’s his to lose, and he will take it by default.\n\nThe fact is that there’s going to be a huge temptation within JD’s camp to try to clear the field. There are certainly advantages to doing so. Not being challenged in the primary is not necessarily a recipe for defeat; the lack of testing and tempering, however, is a real concern. There are ways to compensate for it, like practicing fighting the regime media as Veep as he has been, but none are as good as a real primary.\n\nHe probably won’t get one. It’s not clear that anyone is going to put up a fight, and less clear that any of them could defeat him. He’s just too dominant. In meme terms, think of a beach ball-headed JD Vance with a sword and a loincloth, on a hill made of the skulls of his foes, flexing as Conan the Presumptive Nominee.\n\nOrder Kurt Schlichter’s BRAND NEW bestseller in the Kelly Turnbull People’s Republic conservative action series, “Panama Red,” and follow Kurt on Twitter @KurtSchlichter.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Townhall’s conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

In February, he said he would support former Vice President Kamala Harris if she joined the contest. Months later, Harris decided against it.\n\nIn recent weeks, labor unions quietly lobbied Bonta to reconsider after Sen. Alex Padilla also declined to run and former Rep. Katie Porter, who had been leading in the polls, suffered a series of public relations missteps.\n\nBut Bonta has had bad press of his own. The AG has returned past campaign donations from owners of an Oakland waste-hauling company who have been indicted on federal bribery charges. More recently, he’s offered shifting explanations for why he spent almost half a million dollars in campaign funds on legal services. A spokesperson said Bonta “was approached as a possible victim” in the bribery scheme.\n\nHe would have entered the race as the highest-ranking elected official in the field. He’s spent the last year building up his anti-Trump bona fides, suing the administration more than 50 times, averaging more than one per week. He’s made national headlines joining coalitions of other blue-state attorneys general to bring legal challenges against federalizing the National Guard, cutting off food benefits and defunding Planned Parenthood.\n\nNevertheless, his name ID in the state remains relatively low and he was unlikely to have the field-clearing heft of Harris or Padilla. Giving up the coveted post of attorney general to enter a crowded governor’s race would have been a risky bet.\n\n“I think I would have won. Can I guarantee it? Of course, I can’t,” Bonta said, noting he has never lost an election before.\n\n“I’ve never let a poll dictate my sense of duty, and my conscience is very clear here,” he added. “I have been able to deliver for the people of California in my current role in a way no one else can … I think this is where I’m most effective.”\n\nBonta said he did not plan to endorse any Democrat for governor at the moment. In addition to Porter, the major Democratic contenders vying for a spot in June’s top-two primary include Xavier Becerra, a former California attorney general and ex-Biden Health secretary, Rep. Eric Swalwell, billionaire and Democratic megadonor Tom Steyer, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, former state Controller Betty Yee, state schools Superintendent Tony Thurmond and former state lawmaker Ian Calderon.","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/11/rob-bonta-passes-on-run-for-california-governor-00721784","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/b6c2594/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F0e%2Ff8%2F74d45c0840a088432a0332f9a8ae%2Fsupreme-court-tariffs-53599.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-12 04:44:00","author":"Melanie Mason,Rachel Bluth","authors":["Melanie Mason","Rachel Bluth"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.247},{"id":392418204,"title":"The Harpy Syndrome","text":"If I could write books as fast as I get ideas for one, I would be the next J.K. Rowling. But being contracted to two more Mark Slade detective thrillers by next year, and the Great Hollywood Novel after that, I have to put off my new bestseller brainstorm until 2029 — when I hope it won’t be too late for it, or for America. Unless a sage, prescient publisher, or producer makes me a lucrative offer I can’t refuse for an earlier appearance of The Harpy Syndrome. Put simply, The Harpy Syndrome is the far scarier 21st-century antithesis to The Stepford Wives.\n\nIra Levin’s 1972 feminist horror classic follows a progressive New York married couple, Joanna and Walter, who relocate to Stepford, Connecticut, where all the women are gorgeous, trad housewives catering to their husbands’ every behavioral and sexual preference. They dress provocatively, showcasing physical attributes that invite the Male Gaze. Of course, the initially liberal Walter starts unfavorably comparing Joanna to her more physically and domestically attractive sisters, and ultimately assents to her transformation into a Stepford Wife.\n\nNaturally, when Hollywood got hold of the story for a 1975 production, they blew it as usual. The late, great screenwriter William Goldman (Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, All the President’s Men, The Princess Bride) had happily signed on to adapt Levin’s book, fascinated by the concept of husbands turning their spouses into subservient, sexy trophy wives. His contentment was short-lived once British director Bryan Forbes discarded the wives’ skimpy outfits in favor of absurd, long frilly sundresses and, worse, wide, ugly hats.\n\nGoldman, a purist artist, knew that men would realistically show off their enhanced wives in enticing wear. At the time, the 70s, this meant hot pants, mini-skirts, tennis shorts, and the like. Which, in Goldman’s view, worked visually and thematically to highlight the horror of liberated women mutated into obedient sex kittens.\n\nBut when Forbes changed their dresses to ridiculous body-hiding things, he tried to take his name off the script, as he wrote in his requisite book, Adventures in the Screen Trade: A Personal View of Hollywood and Screenwriting. “More than anything else, it was the costumes in the movie that set my teeth on edge,” Goldman wrote. “At a lawn party on a summer afternoon, the men are in jackets and ties, the women in floor-length dresses. In Stepford? … The women, bringing the beer, would wear hot pants and low-cut blouses. Or maybe wet T-shirts.\n\nBut Forbes had two bad reasons for his credibility-killing change. First, he feared the reaction of his liberal peers to overt stimulative eroticism, even if intellectually salient — such as poster images of the Stepford Wives resembling Russ Meyer-type Supervixens (1975). Second, Forbes cast his wife, Nanette Newman, as one of the main Wives. Then, in her early 40s, Newman couldn’t compete with Hollywood pulchritude — including the film’s star, Katharine Ross — or rise to the aesthetic vision of Levin and Goldman.\n\nNevertheless, in the mid-Seventies, feminism was culturally ascendant, and Hollywood was all in on the movement on both screens. Almost every film featured a lead starlet who could never make the beauty grade as a Stepford Wife “finding herself” by discarding “oppressive” men — Ellen Burstyn in Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore, Jill Clayburgh in An Unmarried Woman, Meryl Streep in Kramer vs. Kramer, Sally Field in Norma Rae, etc.\n\nTelevision was even worse, offering a plethora of homely shrewish “protagonists” — Bea Arthur in Maude, Bonnie Franklin in One Day at a Time, Linda Lavin in Alice. Even an established sitcom, M*A*S*H, stopped being funny when a sexy main character, Hot Lips, became annoying no-nonsense Margaret. Fortunately, three later 70s TV shows brought back female sex appeal and interrupted humorless feminism — Charlie’s Angels, Three’s Company, Wonder Woman.\n\nIt took a bit longer for the big screen to catch up, with the antifeminist monster hit, Animal House. But for the rest of the last century and a decade into the next, appealing sexy women dominated multiple genres — comedy (Porky’s, Fast Times at Ridgemont High, American Pie, There’s Something About Mary), erotic thriller (Body Heat, Basic Instinct, 9-1/2 Weeks), children’s animation (The Little Mermaid, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin) and especially romantic comedy. Then, around 2010, suddenly and decisively, it all ended,\n\nIt’s not that women took over the arts and almost the government; it’s that batty, dysfunctional leftist women did. Because the normal, reasonable women have more important contributions to make to society — like raising the next hopefully great generation, with the help, not hindrance, of their husbands. Weak men gave crazy females the power, as George Lucas gave Kathleen Kennedy (see my article, Exit the Hollywood Women, Part 2 — Kathleen Kennedy), and Barack Obama tried to give Hillary Clinton, and Joe Biden did Kamala Harris.\n\nBut what’s making these women so insane in the first place? That even those blessed with children — though not real men husbands — would drop off their kids at a school, then go with their “wives” or beta male companions in freezing, snowy weather to interfere with law-enforcement agents doing their dangerous legal duty. (“Show your face, big boy!” Renee Nicole Good’s “wife” taunted an ICE officer.) What can make them risk their liberty and lives for criminal scum that would rape them or beat them without a second of regret? It would have to be something mind-blowingly, abnormally evil.\n\nRead The Harpy Syndrome, coming to a bookstore near you in 2028.\n\nREAD MORE from Lou Aguilar:\n\nExit the Hollywood Women, Part 2 — Kathleen Kennedy\n\nExit, the Hollywood Women\n\nHeroes and Zeroes of 2025","summary":"If I could write books as fast as I get ideas for one, I would be the next J.K.

In comments broadcast by NBC, Trump said that the DOJ's Fed subpoenas \"nothing to do with interest rates\" and denied any involvement in the legal matter.\n\nThe investigation escalates Trump’s long-running feud with Powell, whom the president has continually attacked for resisting his demands to slash interest rates significantly (and, in retrospect, Trump was right as the Fed did in fact cut rates at its last 3 meetings having belatedly observed the dramatic deterioration in the labor market without an offsetting surge in inflation). The president has threatened to fire the Fed chair - whom he nominated for the position in 2017 - and raised the prospect of a lawsuit against him related to the $2.5 billion renovation, citing “incompetence.”\n\nIn a striking public response to the NYT report, Powell - who has historically ignored public commentary on Trump's public assaults - issued a forceful written and video statement released Sunday evening using the Federal Reserve's official account on X, in which he said the action was related to his June congressional testimony on ongoing renovations of the Fed’s headquarters. But he said \"this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure.\" The Fed Chair then continued:\n\n\"This new threat is not about my testimony last June or about the renovation of the Federal Reserve buildings. It is not about Congress’s oversight role; the Fed through testimony and other public disclosures made every effort to keep Congress informed about the renovation project. Those are pretexts.\"\n\n“The threat of criminal charges is a consequence of the Federal Reserve setting interest rates based on our best assessment of what will serve the public, rather than following the preferences of the president. This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions — or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation.”\n\n“I have deep respect for the rule of law and for accountability in our democracy. No one—certainly not the chair of the Federal Reserve—is above the law. But this unprecedented action should be seen in the broader context of the administration’s threats and ongoing pressure,” \n\n\"Public service sometimes requires standing firm in the face of threats. I will continue to do the job the Senate confirmed me to do with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.\"\n\nVideo message from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome H. Powell: https://t.co/5dfrkByGyX pic.twitter.com/O4ecNaYaGH\n— Federal Reserve (@federalreserve) January 12, 2026\n\nIn the statement, Powell said he intends to continue doing his job “with integrity and a commitment to serving the American people.” He did not discuss the fact that his delayed actions during the covid crisis sparked the biggest bout of runaway inflation in 40 years, presided over the biggest insider trading scandal at the Fed which led to multiple resignations at the central bank, and was explicitly political by cutting rates in September 2024, two months before the November election, in a bid to sway the vote for Kamala Harris. \n\nIronically, this latest dramatic escalation in the war between the White House and the Marriner Eccles building which are located less than a mile apart, takes place even as Powell has been doing what Trump has wanted all along: cutting rates. The president has repeatedly called for aggressive rate cuts and repeatedly mused about firing Powell. In another extraordinary step, Trump also sought to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook. The Supreme Court is set to take up the Cook case later this month.\n\nWhile the Fed last month cut their benchmark rate to a target range of 3.5% to 3.75%, the third consecutive quarter-point cut, after holding rates steady through much of 2025 when inflation was supposedly about to surge, yet never did while shelter inflation sank to multi-year lows, officials have signaled they’re in no rush to lower rates again until they have more data on inflation and jobs.\n\nsince a few ppl don't get it\n- he has been a failure post covid, and is yet unaccustomed to any scrutiny, now playing a hero\n- lawfare has been a fact of American politics since at least Obama; 10x'ed under Biden > if you were not protesting back then, sorry\n— Barbarian Capital (@BarbarianCap) January 12, 2026\n\nPolicymakers meet next in just over two weeks, on Jan. 27-28, with futures trading shows a minimal chance of a move at that gathering.\n\nPowell’s term as chair will expire in May. His underlying seat on the Fed’s Board of Governor’s doesn’t end until 2028. He hasn’t indicated whether he intends to depart in May or stay on at the central bank.\n\nEarlier this weekend, Trump said he has already picked his nominee to replace Powell. He has not named Powell’s successor, but Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, is a front-runner.\n\nIn response to news of the investigation, Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a member of the Senate Banking Committee which oversees the Fed, came to the Fed’s defense on Sunday night. In a statement he said he would “oppose the confirmation of any nominee for the Fed — including the upcoming Fed chair vacancy — until this legal matter is fully resolved.\"\n\n“If there were any remaining doubt whether advisers within the Trump administration are actively pushing to end the independence of the Federal Reserve, there should now be none. It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question,” Tillis said.\n\nThe Trump administration last summer ramped up scrutiny over the Fed’s renovation of two historic buildings and rising costs associated with the project. Fed budget documents show cost estimates for the project had risen to $2.5 billion in 2025, compared with $1.9 billion in 2023. In testimony last June, Powell broadly disputed media reports, and criticisms from administration officials and some congressional Republicans, that the project had extravagant design features, such as a VIP dining room and roof terrace gardens, Bloomberg reported.\n\nPowell also said during the testimony that the project’s plans had “continued to evolve” and that some earlier features “are no longer in the plans.”\n\nOffice of Management Director Russ Vought referenced the testimony in a letter he sent to Powell last July asking for details on the renovation. Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Administration and a fierce critic of Powell, has alleged that Powell lied about the specifics of the project during the hearing and suggested the matter could amount to sufficient legal “cause” to justify removing the Fed chief from his role. At the time, Republican Representative Anna Paulina Luna also asked the DOJ to consider investigating and prosecuting Powell for allegedly lying under oath in his testimony.\n\nAmid the controversy, Trump toured the renovation site and signaled the project was not reason enough to fire Powell. Months later, on Dec. 29, Trump said he was considering a “gross incompetence” lawsuit against Powell related to the project.\n\nUnder the law that created the Fed, the president can remove members of the Board of Governors only for cause, generally interpreted to mean inefficiency, malfeasance in office or neglect of duty.\n\n“It sounds like Trumpian vengeance and pressuring him to leave in May,” said Mark Spindel, author of The Myth of Independence: How Congress Governs the Federal Reserve, said in reaction to the subpoenas. “If Powell hung around on the board, that complicates Trump’s majority — he needs the seats.”\n\nIronically, by escalation the Fed against Powell, Trump may have made Powell's decision to stick around and mess with the president's plans for a ultradovish Fed, problematic.\n\nOr maybe not and it's all for show: according to the latest Polymarket odds, the probability of Powell being federally charged by June 30 - a date that is beyond Powell's chairman tenure - is only 18%.\n\nThe US dollar weakened on news of the probe, falling against all its major counterparts, while gold extended gains to a record high and bitcoin jumped. Futures on the S&P 500 Index fell 0.3%.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/fed-subpoenaed-doj-launches-criminal-probe-jerome-powell-who-vows-stand-firm","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2026-01/trump%20powell_1.jpg?h=2bf40b37&amp;itok=Y7_NTqj9","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-12 03:05:56","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.22},{"id":392381254,"title":"Golden Globes host Nikki Glaser mocks CBS News as 'best place to see BS news'","text":"Comedian Nikki Glaser mocked CBS News as the place for \"BS news\" in her monologue for the 83rd Golden Globe Awards ceremony Sunday night. \"And the award for 'Most Editing' goes to CBS News.

There are more than 2,400 federal agents, more than double the number of local police officers, and the federal government intends to send hundreds more.The administration says the surge has been necessary to conduct both immigration enforcement and to investigate a growing fraud scandal in the state, the cost of which federal prosecutors estimate could top $9 billion. The scandal dates back to 2021, when Biden administration Justice Department investigators first honed in on an at least $250 million COVID-era scam revolving around the Feeding Our Future program, a case that now includes more than 75 defendants. Most of the defendants are of Somali descent, leading President Trump and other Republican lawmakers to focus attention on the state's large Somali community, while threatening to suspend federal funding to the state across a broad array of programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and child care funding.These actions have drawn stiff criticism from local officials, including Omar.\"There is no reason for them to use this level of rhetoric. There is no reason for them to fully stop these programs, funding these programs,\" Omar said. \"The only reason they are doing that is for PR purposes. And it is harming our state. It is harming my constituents.\"In response to Omar's comments, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said Sunday that it was \"not surprising\" that the congresswoman is \"more concerned about Somali fraudsters being held accountable for their crimes than she is about the fraud taking place.\"With Minnesota in the eye of a federal storm, Gov. Tim Walz announced on Jan. 5 that he won't seek reelection. Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate during the 2024 presidential election, had become a focus of Republican criticism amid the scandal. He said last week that he was ending his gubernatorial reelection bid because of the fraud probe, implying that the focus on Minnesota was a political vendetta targeting him, and pleading for the White House to withdraw federal agents.\"If it's me, you're already getting what you want, but leave my people alone,\" Walz said.Omar praised Walz's decision as selfless.\"He wants to focus on defending our state and not defending a seat,\" Omar said.","summary":"Democratic Rep.

But his personal ties to the story and explorations of race and belonging are consistent with his four other feature films, “Fruitvale Station,” “Creed,” and the record-breaking “Black Panther” and its sequel “Black Panther: Wakanda Forever.”“Sinners,” Coogler told NBC News, is a tribute to his Uncle James, who “was the oldest male member of my family from Mississippi.” “He meant a lot to me,” Coogler said. “He passed away right after I was in post-production on ‘Creed,’ and all he would do is play blues records.”From left, Michael B.

Skydance's owner, David Ellison, then undertook sweeping changes at the combined media entity, including a wave of layoffs and new leadership at CBS News.The merger came after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit from President Donald Trump, who had accused CBS News of deceptively editing a \"60 Minutes\" interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris. (CBS denied that accusation.)Paramount also made headlines after it canceled the late-night talk show hosted by Stephen Colbert, a vocal critic of both the Trump administration and CBS' settlement with the president. CBS insisted the decision not to renew Colbert's show was \"purely a financial decision.\"Ellison is not done remaking Hollywood. Paramount is battling with Netflix for ownership of the fabled studio Warner Bros.; Paramount's bid is backed in part by Ellison's father, the Silicon Valley billionaire and Trump ally Larry Ellison.All of these larger corporate and political flashpoints loom in the background of tonight's ceremony — and they could provide fodder for emcee Nikki Glaser's opening monologue.\n\n13h ago / 6:10 PM ESTDiego Luna is nominated for his role in 'Andor.'

Last year, 9.3 million people tuned in to watch host Nikki Glaser gently roast stars like Timothée Chalamet and Nicole Kidman on CBS, according to Nielsen, less than half the 20 million or so who watched in the 2010s. And the Globes has never been terribly predictive of the Oscars.Add to that years of scandal and controversy, including a series of 2021 L.A. Times stories alleging ethical lapses and diversity failures, followed by more recent kerfuffles about a new podcasting category, and it sort of begs the question: Why does Hollywood still show up for this show?Atmosphere at 82nd Annual Golden Globes Red Carpet Rollout at The Beverly Hilton on January 02, 2025 in Beverly Hills, California. Michael Buckner / Penske Media / Getty ImagesThe reason for the Globes’ remarkable endurance as an A-lister pit stop is the show’s timing, tone and ability to attract attention, even in our highly distracted age. When grabbing eyeballs is harder than ever, an actor’s red carpet moment or charming acceptance speech at the Golden Globes can still help a movie or show find its audience. Nine-point-three million people ain’t nothin’, after all, and the halo effect from news and social media coverage continues for days.“The Globes matter,” said Tony Angelotti, a film awards strategist who this year is working on campaigns for “Wicked: For Good” and “Zootopia 2.” “Especially as it becomes more and more competitive to promote projects to an increasingly fractured audience.”\n\n14h ago / 5:03 PM EST'Heated Rivalry' duo set to present“Heated Rivalry,” the steamy Canadian hockey show from Crave, isn’t nominated for anything tonight.

The city is broke and will need a series of exemptions and extensions from Congress and the White House.\n\nThere have been some positive initial signs.\n\nWorking with Landry and House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-La.), Moreno and the Louisiana Republicans were able to convince the Department of Homeland Security to offer a six-month extension on a pot of infrastructure money that comes from FEMA.\n\nAs with Landry, Moreno has known Scalise, whose district includes New Orleans, for years, and they have a cordial relationship. The two can and do call each other directly on their cell phone. She said she had not yet spoken with House Speaker Mike Johnson, however, whose district geographically, culturally and spiritually is far closer to Arkansas than it is New Orleans.\n\nNeither of the two Louisiana leaders is known as a pork-barreler, though, much to her chagrin.\n\n“You would think we’d be getting so much more,” Moreno said, recounting how former Sens. John Breaux and Mary Landrieu, both Democrats, were happy to send anything back home from Washington that wasn’t nailed down. “I don’t see our delegation doing that. And then also, Mike Johnson, I mean, his alignment is solely to just do what Trump wants.”\n\nOne request of the feds the delegation may be happy to fulfill, though, is on law and order: Moreno desperately wants more federal prosecutors to help quickly adjudicate a backlog of cases here.\n\nFor all the connections Louisiana Republicans have to Trump, Moreno would have been better situated had Kamala Harris won — and not just because they share a party. The then-city councilor was an early supporter of Harris’s presidential campaign in 2019, and the two have stayed in touch. The former vice-president, in fact, will attend Moreno’s inauguration on Monday, before staying in town to sell her book the following day.\n\nYet Moreno didn’t hesitate to invoke Trump’s victory as an illustration of how voters reward a focus “on what’s right in front of them” — namely, the cost of living. And whether it’s the president, Mamdani or herself, Moreno said, that was the key to success.\n\nHowever, there’s something else here — a city traditionally bifurcated by race, and within race by class, that’s also still male-dominated — which helped Mareno transcend those old rules.\n\n“The city of New Orleans embraced me, coming in as a young journalist,” she said. “And I learned that this city — it will love you back if you love it.”","url":"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2026/01/11/helena-moreno-and-the-new-orleans-comeback-everyone-is-watching-00720937","image":"https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/78bd1c5/2147483647/resize/1200x/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd0%2F6b%2F3077332247659bcb792c746b617f%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2249289368","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-11 15:00:00","author":"Jonathan Martin","authors":["Jonathan Martin"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.148},{"id":392289278,"title":"The YIMBY Hero Everyone Is Shouting At","text":"Scott Wiener has an unusual distinction in American politics: He upsets almost everybody. In the months before I met the California state senator—who is now running for Nancy Pelosi’s congressional seat—he had been harangued at one public meeting after another. In October, pro-Palestinian protesters disrupted his campaign’s pumpkin-carving event to shout: “Wiener, Wiener, you can’t hide; we charge you with genocide.” (This was not an isolated incident.) His usual response in these situations is to wait calmly and then carry on as normal.\n\nAt another event a few days later, the singer Tish Hyman, who identified herself as “the only Black lesbian here,” confronted Wiener about his far-reaching support for transgender inclusion. “What would you say to women who are seeking assurance that their safety will be protected from men who by California law can self-ID as women in women-only spaces?” asked Hyman. Wiener replied that he was committed to the safety of all women—trans women included. Video of the confrontation went viral.\n\nIn an era when many politicians try to make only the most cautious public statements, or the ones most palatable to their side of the political spectrum, Wiener is an outlier. As a gay, Jewish politician, he defends Israel in ways that get him in trouble with the left. His LGBTQ advocacy not only has made him a target of the right but also goes too far for people such as Hyman, who voted for Kamala Harris. And as a YIMBY—an acronym that stands for “Yes in My Backyard”—he’s faced down San Francisco’s powerful homeowner class, who wrap their aversion to new housing in the language of environmentalism and social justice. His successful housing legislation has attracted national attention—to get homes built in San Francisco, you have to be something close to a magician. He “works on thorny issues of policy and politics with a wonk’s focus and a jock’s tenacity,” a recent Mother Jones article declared. The New York Times’ Ezra Klein credited him for being, “for a very long time, this lonely voice trying to radically expand housing supply.”\n\nWiener stands athwart some of the touchiest fault lines in today’s politics, and his extreme tolerance for pushback has made him one of the most effective legislators in the country. He also might be the most shouted-at politician in America. “I have supporters in San Francisco who don’t love my housing work,” Wiener told me, “but they either don’t love it, but they understand why I’m doing it—or they don’t love it, but they tolerate it and they like me because of other issues, right?”\n\nAlthough in other ways you couldn’t imagine two more dissimilar men, Wiener’s ferociously active spirit resembles the Bolshevik antsiness of Donald Trump. The current president is attractive to some voters who might not agree with his values, or his language, or even his policies, but who like that the president is, well, presidenting. Last year, Trump bulldozed the East Wing of the White House, one of the most recognizable historic sites in the United States. In Democratic cities, people demand 38 meetings and three dozen environmental assessments before tearing down a crack den to build a nursery for sad orphans. Voters, Wiener argues, want politicians who are “willing to break glass to get those things done.”\n\nIn any shot of the California legislature, Wiener is instantly recognizable—a 6-foot-7 figure in a crisp suit and tie. He studied law at Harvard, where Ketanji Brown Jackson, now a Supreme Court justice, was a classmate. He moved to San Francisco in the 1990s to take a job with a law firm, where he worked on LGBTQ issues and housing policy. “As a young attorney in the late 1990s, I represented a long-term HIV survivor facing eviction,” he wrote last year. “He told me he could either return to the South for housing and lose access to quality HIV care, or stay in San Francisco for the care he needed but become homeless.”\n\nWiener has competition for Pelosi’s seat, and the composition of his rivals tells an interesting story about the various currents of the modern Democratic Party. One of his opponents is Saikat Chakrabarti, a 39-year-old start-up centimillionaire who previously served as chief of staff to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Pelosi has not formally endorsed a candidate, but she has appeared at events with another contender, Connie Chan, a progressive member of the city’s Board of Supervisors who is popular with labor unions. Wiener says Chan caters to NIMBYs; her supporters call Wiener a pro-developer capitalist.\n\nThe race has now become a proxy for the California housing wars, which pit younger renters against established homeowners in neighborhoods zoned for single-family units. This summer, Wiener finally got so-called infill legislation passed, which permits denser construction near public transportation. Senate Bill 79 was the third version of the bill—the first, S.B. 827, died in committee all the way back in 2018. “When we did S.B. 827, it was like a brand-new thing, like no bill like that, even in the same universe had ever been introduced before,” Wiener told me.\n\nAfter its failure, Wiener looked for compromises and championed other bills aimed at increasing housing supply. At the same time, pressure groups worked hard to get younger, more YIMBY legislators elected. “Term limits have their downsides,” he told me. “One of the upsides is you have new, fresh thinking on different issues, and this is one of them.” Less high-mindedly, when S.B. 79 ran into resistance in Sacramento, he made a deal—pledging that housing more than 85 feet tall, or on land owned by transit authorities, would use unionized labor. After making such concessions, the bill finally squeaked through.\n\nIn the wild seas of California politics, his YIMBYism has drawn attacks from the left. “There are some people in San Francisco, if you believe in making it easier to build things, then that somehow makes you a moderate,” he said. Wiener is often attacked for not being left-wing enough. As a member of the city’s Board of Supervisors, he fought to ban public nudity from the Castro neighborhood outside of Pride parades and other special events. As a result, he was sharply criticized by radical nudists. “The San Francisco labels are stupid,” he told me. He considers himself “very progressive” and is more overtly sex-positive than even the typical Bay Area politician. He has posed shirtless in a leather necktie at the Folsom Street Fair, and spoken publicly about taking Truvada, a pill that dramatically reduces the chances of contracting HIV.\n\nSince October 7, Weiner has clearly found it hard to reconcile his commitment to Israel with the mood among leftists who endorse his support for LGBTQ rights. He is the son of Conservative Jewish parents who founded a congregation near their home in rural Turnersville, New Jersey; he says he was called a “kike” and a “Christ-hater” at school. Both of his nephews were Bar Mitzvah–ed in Israel, and he still has relatives there. “It’s the home of half of all Jews on the planet,” he notes.\n\nWiener has described Israel’s actions in Gaza as “indefensible,” condemned the violence of West Bank settlers, and called for an end to arms sales to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government. But he has also argued that Israel has a right to defend itself, and a right to exist as a Jewish state, and he does not characterize the bombing of Gaza as a genocide—a description that the San Francisco left insists upon. Both Chakrabarti and Chan had an easier time with the crowd at the candidates’ first joint appearance, on January 7, because they held up signs saying yes when the moderator asked whether Israel was committing genocide. Wiener declined to answer the question in either direction.\n\nHe links these purity tests to medieval tropes that defined “good Jews” as those who quietly obeyed the authorities and “bad Jews” as those who were too open about their identity. Today, he sees Jews being pushed out of progressive circles based on similar judgments. “If part of your Jewishness is, you know, that you support the homeland of the Jews and the home of one-half of all Jews on the planet, then that makes you a bad Jew,” he said. “If you’re not willing to use the exact language that we want you to use, then you’re a bad Jew.”\n\nWiener told me that since October 7, he has personally—“as a state senator who has no role in foreign policy”—experienced an increase in anti-Semitism. So have other Jewish leaders and businesspeople in San Francisco. “It’s not just about Israel,” he said. “It’s straight-up anti-Semitism.” On December 7, for example, he posted on X about California students who formed a human swastika on school football field, uploading their photo alongside a Hitler quotation about how “international financial Jews” would plunge the world into war, leading to the “annihilation of the Jewish race.”\n\nHe is regularly confronted in public by provocateurs with cameras, filming clips for social media. Wiener says he wants to stay open to those who want a genuine conversation, such as a non-Zionist Jewish friend who brought over eight people for a two-hour meeting on the subject. “We had a wonderful dialogue,” he maintains.\n\nTalking with Wiener was my way of stepping outside my own tribe on one set of issues. His transgender-rights advocacy, in my view, ignores serious gaps in the evidence base for youth gender medicine and brushes aside women’s concerns about biological males in their sports and single-sex spaces.\n\nThe story of the woman who confronted Wiener, Tish Hyman, is that she felt unsafe changing in front of a transgender woman, Alexis Black, in a gym. Hyman confronted the gym staff, who threw her and Black out; under California law, people can use whichever locker room aligns with their gender identity. After the incident went viral, it emerged that Black, under the name Grant Freeman, had previously pleaded guilty to assault, after breaking her then-wife’s jaw. (Upon transitioning after the attack, Black took the ex-wife’s first name.) Wiener argues that transgender women face violence, too, and should not be treated as an inherent threat. “I think anyone who is harassing anyone or engaging in weird, creepy, inappropriate behavior in a locker room, in a group bathroom, something should be done about that,” Wiener tells me, “whether that is a cis man, cis woman, trans man. That should not be tolerated.” Transgender people who want to get on with their lives without harassment and abuse should not suffer because of the actions of the occasional creep, he says.\n\nThe argument isn’t about what policies he supports, he says, because he has never proposed a bill about restrooms or locker rooms specifically. “The triggering thing I said on that stage,” he said, referring to the event where Hyman and others criticized him, “is trans women are women, and they fundamentally dispute that.”\n\nIf California Governor Gavin Newsom runs for president, he will have to answer for the state’s many gender-related policies championed by Wiener, such as adding a nonbinary option to driver’s licenses. Wiener also proposed S.B. 357, which repealed California’s law criminalizing loitering with intent to commit prostitution. He has argued that this prevents young people, in many cases members of sexual or racial minorities, from being hassled by police; the Times recently reported that the new approach hampered police attempts to find underage girls working on the streets.\n\nLegislation like this has made Wiener a frequent target of MAGA influencers such as Libs of TikTok. In 2024, an account called “End Wokeness” posted a description of his voting record over the Folsom Street Fair photo, alongside another with Kamala Harris. Elon Musk, the owner of X, reposted it with the comment: “Wiener is an utter scumbag.”\n\nPerhaps because of the nastiness of the attacks, Wiener tends toward a knee-jerk dismissal of people who disagree with him on these issues. He told me that the MAGA information universe that amplified Tish Hyman hates him as “the gay Jew from San Francisco who thinks trans kids are, like, full human beings.” I objected that there is also a liberal criticism that gender-questioning teens who might need talk therapy are being put on a medical pathway. We went back and forth. He said that all the American medical associations support puberty blockers; I noted that systematic evidence reviews, such as those commissioned for Britain’s exhaustive Cass Report, do not. He said that the Cass Report was “debunked.” I replied that one critical paper on the Yale Law School website—not peer-reviewed, and written in part by doctors who prescribe these treatments themselves—is not a debunking. He argued that gender surgeries on minors are rare (true) and that regret rates are low (we don’t know, because the institutions that made experimental gender treatments mainstream did not pause to collect systematic data).\n\nIn general, Wiener seems more patient with those who criticize him over Gaza than with people who part with him on gender. I asked him about that difference: Just as the abusive, disruptive pro-Palestinian activists might nonetheless have a fair point about Netanyahu’s policies, aren’t some of the concerns about single-sex spaces and puberty blockers worth hearing out, even if Libs of TikTok is awful to him? He didn’t bite.\n\nStill, you don’t have to agree with him on everything to realize that he’s making a fundamentally different calculation from applause-driven careerists. One of the reasons that you can argue with Wiener—or shout at him, if your politics dictate that approach—is that he has strong beliefs and argues them bravely, even when they are unpopular. He fights, he loses, and he fights again until he wins.","summary":"Scott Wiener—a pro-trans Zionist who wants California to allow more homes—has an extreme tolerance for pushback.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/2026/01/scott-wiener-yimby-shouted-at/685566/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vGgkk7__-4v0hbPvaFMQva5stHU=/1x0:3999x2249/720x405/media/img/mt/2026/01/2026_01_11_Scott_Wiener_the_Countrys_Most_Shouted_At_Politician/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-11 12:00:00","author":"Helen Lewis","authors":["Helen Lewis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.169},{"id":392351620,"title":"How ICE raids in Minnesota connect to a years-old fraud scandal","text":"On Wednesday morning, the Department of Homeland Security posted on X, “GOOD MORNING MINNEAPOLIS!” Rep. Tom Emmer, a House Republican leader who represents Minneapolis suburbs, commented with encouragement: “Go out there and get ‘em.” The Trump administration has surged thousands of immigration agents into the Twin Cities in what it has called the largest DHS operation ever. While the administration often frames its deportation operations as efforts to keep Americans safe, it has added another angle to its Minnesota campaign: eradicating fraud. In 2022, during the Biden administration, federal prosecutors uncovered an enormous scheme to defraud a pandemic meals program in Minnesota’s Somali community, leading to charges against dozens of defendants and a growing number of convictions. In the weeks leading up to the DHS deployment, conservative commentators had elevated that years-old scandal, suggesting that fraud was a reason to target East African migrants in the Minneapolis area. And within days of the story taking hold in conservative social media circles, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem posted on X that agents were “on the ground” in response. More than 2,000 agents and officers from DHS have descended on the Twin Cities, and tensions are running high after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer fatally shot Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old mom. DHS has said the incident was an act of self-defense, while some witnesses and Minneapolis’ mayor have challenged that explanation. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has attacked the Somali community as “garbage,” and right-wing influencers have filled X with videos purporting to investigate day cares connected to immigrants in an effort, they claim, to uncover ongoing fraud. Here’s how a scandal prosecuted under both the Biden and Trump administrations went from a relatively local issue to one that has captured nationwide attention and been cited to bolster the White House’s immigration crackdown. The crime The scale of the fraud was massive. Prosecutors initially described a $250 million scheme but have since raised their estimate to $300 million — the largest fraud to come out of Covid-19 relief programs. Federal prosecutors charged 78 defendants with connections to Feeding Our Future, the Minneapolis nonprofit organization at the center of the scandal. A jury convicted the accused ringleader in March, while other defendants have pleaded guilty and still more are awaiting trial. Most of them are of Somali descent, and the vast majority are American citizens, according to The New York Times, citing prosecutors. The scam concerned government-subsidized meals for kids, prosecutors said: The nonprofit took grant money meant to feed thousands of children in minority communities, but its work was fictitious and it submitted fake records to keep the money flowing. Prosecutors have widened their scope. Using the Feeding Our Future fraud as a jumping off point, they have since brought charges against other members of Minnesota’s Somali community alleging fraud against other government support programs. How it started The scandal began during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic. Government spending ramped up to try to alleviate the economic fallout, and agencies loosened some spending restrictions. Prosecutors said that Aimee Bock, Feeding Our Future’s founder and executive director, worked with co-conspirators to create shell companies, fake attendance rosters and falsify documents to indicate thousands of children were being served meals. Many of the children Bock was allegedly feeding — and many of her co-conspirators — were Somali Americans. In November of last year, when conservative influencers started to take an interest in Minnesota fraud cases, they approached nonprofits and businesses with similar questions: asking whether they were providing the services they said they were. Why it went on so long There were early red flags, according to an autopsy of the failures conducted by the nonpartisan Office of the Legislative Auditor in Minnesota. As far back as 2018, the Minnesota Department of Education received complaints about Feeding Our Future’s management. And in February 2020, the Internal Revenue Service revoked the organization’s nonprofit status, citing a failure to file documentation. Then, in April 2020, with schools closed and safety net programs ramping up, Feeding Our Future sent a draft lawsuit to the Minnesota Department of Education, threatening to sue if the state did not approve its applications for meal programs. The state complied, according to the legislative auditor. A similar pattern continued for more than a year. In November 2020, Feeding Our Future sued the Minnesota Department of Education, alleging that the state was slow-walking its grant applications. The lawsuit put state officials on the defensive, according to the Office of the Legislative Auditor, and deterred them from taking action against the nonprofit. Auditors faulted the state for not having the investigative chops to catch fraud. For example, the state conducted some of its oversight visits virtually — a practice that it later acknowledged did not work. How they were caught The FBI learned about the fraud through a tip, according to legislative auditors: In February 2021, the FBI notified the state of allegations it received that Bock was accepting kickbacks and not providing the meals she said she was. Two months later, the state education department told the FBI that the tip had some merit, and the FBI launched its investigation in May. Consequences arrived in 2022. That January, the FBI raided the office of Feeding Our Future, and the Minnesota Department of Education cut off its funding. Later that year, federal prosecutors announced indictments against 47 defendants. U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland described it as “the largest pandemic relief fraud scheme charged to date,” at $250 million. While the case made national and international headlines because of the scale, the indictments mostly played out in courtrooms and outside the spotlight. Three defendants pleaded guilty in October 2022, and prosecutors began preparing to take the other defendants to trial. A jury convicted five defendants in a June 2024 trial, and prosecutors also charged additional people beyond those originally indicted. The 2024 election When Democrat Kamala Harris selected Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate in August 2024, the fraud investigation was one of the first things Republicans used to attack him. That fall, House Republicans issued a subpoena to Walz for documents related to his oversight of Feeding our Future. But the fraud case fell from national discussion after Harris lost. Federal prosecutors kept working on the case. Andrew Luger, the Biden-appointed U.S. attorney in Minnesota, said in December 2024 that he did not expect the election result to significantly alter how the government prosecuted fraud cases like the one involving Feeding Our Future. “That’s bipartisan,” he told The Minnesota Star Tribune shortly before leaving office. The investigation mushrooms Bock, the Feeding Our Future founder whom prosecutors called the mastermind of the fraud, was found guilty in March 2025. She’s now awaiting sentencing and has been ordered to forfeit assets, including a 2013 Porsche and $3.5 million from Feeding Our Future’s bank account. But federal prosecutors have not stopped their investigation into the meals program. In recent months, they have pursued what they said were similar fraud cases involving other safety-net programs. In September 2025, the Department of Justice charged eight people, alleging they defrauded a Minnesota program meant to help seniors and people with disabilities find housing. The same month, it charged a man whom prosecutors accused of defrauding a Minnesota health care program designed to help people with autism. “These massive fraud schemes form a web that has stolen billions of dollars in taxpayer money,” said Joseph H. Thompson, a career federal prosecutor who was serving as the acting U.S. attorney in Minnesota at the time. Conservative media takes a new interest On Sep. 18, Trump took aim at Minnesota’s Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar, who was born in Somalia, and Somali Americans, telling reporters on Air Force One that Omar is “terrible” and saying, “They come from a place with nothing, nothing, no, anything, and then they tell us how to run our country.” Trump’s criticism came after Republicans had unsuccessfully tried to censure her over a reposted video on her X account that Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., said “smeared Charlie Kirk and implied he was to blame for his own murder.” On Nov. 19, City Journal, a magazine run by the Manhattan Institute, a right-leaning think tank, published a story summarizing the Minnesota fraud allegations. It largely drew on local media coverage, indictments and press releases from prosecutors, but it also cited anonymous sources to make the claim that some of the money was routed to al-Shabab, a Somalia-based militant group that the U.S. and other countries have designated as a terrorist organization. Fox News picked up the story. One of the article’s named sources later criticized the piece, and federal prosecutors have not claimed that any of the government funds went to militant groups. Christopher Rufo, one of the City Journal writers, has posted on X that he stands by the piece. City Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters reported that the claim about al-Shabab apparently made its way to Trump via several Republican lawmakers. Within two days, Trump said he would terminate temporary deportation protections for Somalis living in Minnesota, asserting on social media that the state had become “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.” Trump continued to attack Somali immigrants in December, as ICE agents launched a new deportation operation in the Twin Cities, which Reuters reported had put the Somali community there on edge. Influencers focus on day cares At the same time, Nick Shirley, a right-wing YouTube influencer from Utah, was on the ground in Minneapolis filming himself attempting to visit Somali child care centers. He had previously published a video about Muslims in Minnesota that insinuated an Islamic takeover was afoot, drawing little attention. But on Dec. 26, he released a 42-minute video claiming he uncovered over $100 million in fraud. It quickly went viral and now has more than 139 million views on X. Other social media influencers and journalists have visited the same facilities identified in Shirley’s video in the two weeks since he posted it — some echoing Shirley’s claims they are fraudulent, and others demonstrating things he got wrong. The Minnesota Star Tribune reported on Jan. 1 that during its visits to the same day cares where Shirley had shown or insinuated no children were present, the newspaper observed children in four and wasn’t allowed inside six others. Minnesota’s Department of Children, Youth, and Families said on Jan. 2 that its investigators checked nine of the child care facilities portrayed as fraudulent in viral social media clips and found they were operating normally, and one is now closed. Unproven fraud claims expand beyond Minnesota Over New Year’s week, Shirley’s video was the top story across conservative media. Right-wing political activists and influencers quickly picked up on his viral success and emulated his tactics with similar videos in which they visited day cares in other states including Ohio, Oregon and Washington. Prominent pro-Trump accounts on X amplified the videos and other posts from people who raised questions about day care business filings. The vast majority of child care facilities spotlighted appeared to be connected to Somali immigrants. Some state lawmakers and congressional candidates called for state investigations into whether “Minnesota-style fraud” was occurring in their towns. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, tried to tamp down speculation about rampant, unchecked fraud in the state, fact-checking viral but misleading claims on X about some specific day cares. In a subsequent press conference on Jan. 5, he further elaborated on how the state conducts oversight of its 5,200 child care facilities. DeWine said the public shouldn’t be surprised that day cares are telling people who show up while filming that they aren’t allowed to come inside; it’s for the protection of children. “Hell no — no one should let them in,” he said. But conservative content creators and activists have continued posting videos of themselves visiting day cares run by members of the Somali community in Ohio and other states. They’ve also drawn attention to business filings, raising questions about why some companies share mailing addresses or ownership. Musse Olol, president of the Somali American Council of Oregon, told NBC News that businesses in the community have faced what appeared to be coordinated harassment, ranging from racial and religious insults online to people taking photos outside of their offices. “This feels like an unprecedented and targeted campaign,” Olol said. The Council on American-Islamic Relations, a nonprofit advocacy group, said Monday that Somali American-run day care centers and businesses need more law enforcement protection because they’ve received an onslaught of threats stemming from the firestorm on social media. Trump administration freezes funds The social media focus on day cares has prompted a multiagency response from the Trump administration. The Department of Health and Human Services said last week it was withholding nearly $10 billion in federal funds that support child care, primarily through the Temporary Assistance to Needy Families program, from five states run by Democrats: California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota and New York. On Friday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the move. Vice President JD Vance told reporters Thursday that the administration planned to create a new assistant attorney general position — run directly out of the White House — to investigate fraud allegations. He claimed there was misconduct in Ohio and California, though he did not provide examples. The Trump administration has demanded California provide verified attendance information to get its child care funds back, according to a series of letters from the federal Administration for Children and Families cited in the New York Post that speculate that welfare funds have gone to ineligible noncitizens. HHS also proposed a series of new rules this week to change how day care is subsidized by the government, including getting rid of a requirement to pay based on enrollment figures. Jim O’Neill, the department’s deputy secretary, said on social media that the Biden administration made it easier for fraud to occur in day care support programs through a regulation that based payment on enrollment rather than attendance. However, the Biden-era regulation still permitted states to require attendance records from child care providers and cut them off if they showed “excessive unexplained absences.” Meanwhile, DHS posted several tweets in recent weeks announcing that its agents are going “DOOR TO DOOR” in Minnesota to investigate unnamed businesses for fraud, and the DOJ said it is sending additional federal prosecutors to help. Congressional Republicans have also seized on the issue. On Wednesday, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee held the first in a planned series of hearings on social services fraud in Minnesota. Three Minnesota GOP lawmakers appeared as witnesses, answering questions from Republicans on the committee that steered blame toward Walz. Congressional Democrats accused Republicans of inappropriately focusing on the Somali community. The committee’s GOP leadership said it may subpoena Walz — who ended his bid for a third term as governor this week — and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison for a future hearing. That same day — the last of Renee Nicole Good’s life — acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said the agency was surging agents into Minnesota as part of the “largest immigration operation ever.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/internet/ice-raids-minnesota-connect-years-old-fraud-scandal-rcna253151","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-12/251231-minnesota-health-services-mn-0936-9f396b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-11 11:00:40","author":"David Ingram,Tyler Kingkade","authors":["David Ingram","Tyler Kingkade"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.033},{"id":392344974,"title":"Billie Eilish Brands ICE A 'Terrorist Group' Following Minneapolis Shooting, Joins Protests To Defund Agency","text":"When Billie Eilish took to Instagram on Friday afternoon, her message was unambiguous and deeply personal.The nine-time Grammy winner, who has spent the past year watching the Trump administration's immigration enforcement efforts unfold across her home state of California, reshared a series of posts that pulled no punches: the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency was branded a 'federally funded and supported terrorist group' responsible for 'tearing apart families, terrorising citizens, and now murdering innocent people'.Her intervention came just two days after 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was fatally shot by ICE officer Jonathan Ross during an immigration enforcement operation in a residential Minneapolis neighbourhood on Wednesday morning.Yet Eilish's posts represented something more than a reflexive celebrity response to a tragedy. They signalled a threshold moment—one that has now galvanised a nationwide reckoning with the agency's methods under the Trump administration.What Happened In Minneapolis: The Disputed Shooting And Official NarrativesThe incident itself has become the focal point of a fierce dispute over what actually transpired on Portland Avenue. The Department of Homeland Security, President Trump, and Vice President JD Vance have all maintained that Good attempted to run over ICE officers in what they characterise as an act of self-defence. Yet verified video footage tells a starkly different story.ABC News' frame-by-frame analysis reveals that Good was actually steering her Honda Pilot away from the officer who shot her, not towards him, in the moments before the first of three shots rang out at 9:37 a.m. The vehicle she was operating, an SUV, was moving forward down a residential street when the shooting commenced—not attacking.Even Trump himself seemed troubled by what he witnessed when he reviewed the footage in the Oval Office with a New York Times reporter present. 'Well ... I ... the way I look at it ... it's a terrible scene,' the twice-impeached president reportedly said. 'I think it's horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it.' The comment, halting and uncomfortable, stood in sharp contrast to the unequivocal defence that his administration had mounted for the shooting.ICE And The Politics Of Immigration EnforcementEilish's social media activism has sparked a predictable backlash from federal authorities. The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement dismissing her posts as 'garbage rhetoric', insisting that Good had 'weaponised her vehicle' in an attempt to kill an officer.The agency doubled down on its controversial claims, even releasing footage purportedly taken by the officer who shot Good—a move designed to corroborate the official narrative. Yet local officials, including Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, swiftly pushed back, with Walz cautioning the public against believing 'the propaganda machine'.The broader context here is crucial. Eilish has long been forthright in her opposition to Trump's policies, having endorsed Kamala Harris during the 2024 presidential election. Yet her recent activism signals an escalation.Before Friday, she had already shared posts condemning ICE raids in Los Angeles, the city where she was born and raised. The Minneapolis shooting has transformed what might have been distant political opposition into something visceral and immediate—a moment that demands action.Across the country, Eilish is far from alone in her outrage. The second reshare on her Instagram Story called for the complete abolition of ICE, whilst listing 32 individuals who reportedly died in the agency's custody over the past year. A third post urged American citizens to contact their congressional representatives, demanding that Officer Ross be arrested and prosecuted.Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has been equally forthright, telling reporters to 'get the f—k out of Minneapolis' during a press conference on 8 January, describing the shooting as an act of 'recklessly exercising power that led to someone's death'.What distinguishes this moment from previous controversies surrounding ICE is the sheer scale of public response. More than one thousand demonstrations against Trump's immigration crackdown have been organised across the country. Schools in Minneapolis cancelled classes.The Minneapolis City Council released a statement honouring Good as 'a resident of our city who was out caring for her neighbours' when her life was taken. Her mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minnesota Star Tribune that Renee was simply living her life in the Twin Cities with her partner when the tragedy unfolded—just blocks from her home.The tragedy underscores a hard reality about ICE's enforcement operations under the current administration. For Eilish, Frey, and countless others now demanding accountability, Good's death represents not an aberration but the logical endpoint of an agency granted increasing authority to operate with minimal oversight.Whether her voice—amplified by millions of followers—will translate into meaningful legislative change remains to be seen. What is certain is that the conversation about ICE's future has fundamentally shifted.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/billie-eilish-brands-ice-terrorist-group-following-minneapolis-shooting-joins-protests-1769939","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1764851/billie-eilish.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=ddd0bcbec0c41d65c42d954435e979a3","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-11 10:39:41","author":"Jaja Agpalo","authors":["Jaja Agpalo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.554},{"id":392276904,"title":"'You cannot break us': Protesters rally in Minneapolis after ICE fatal shooting","text":"MINNEAPOLIS — Thousands gathered in Minneapolis on Saturday to push back on the Trump administration's deployment of federal forces after an Immigration and Customs Enforcement officer shot and killed a woman earlier this week. \n\nPeople held signs with the face of Renee Good, the 37-year-old mother who was shot in the head on Wednesday, while calling for ICE to get out of their city. \n\n\"Nobody should be taken off the streets,\" Emily Sanderson, who was attending the demonstration, told The Canadian Press. \"Nobody should be murdered in the streets. It's irrational. It's disgusting.\"\n\nThe massive protest marked the latest demonstration that has gripped the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, which have become the main target of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown. \n\nDaily protests have taken place since the fatal shooting, with local and state representatives calling for ICE to leave to allow tensions to lower. \n\nThe Trump administration has said the ICE officer was acting in self-defence and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem pledged that federal forces will stay in the state. \n\nThere are about 2,000 officers deployed in the area, which the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said is its largest immigration operation, and more are expected to arrive.\n\nThe size of Saturday's rally did not deter federal forces, who were spotted not far away conducting identity checks. \n\nEarlier Saturday morning, Minnesota Democrats said they were denied entry into the ICE processing facility in Minneapolis. \n\nRep.

Ilhan Omar, a Somali-American member who has repeatedly faced derogatory comments from President Donald Trump, posted on social media that members of Congress \"have a legal right and constitutional responsibility to conduct oversight where people are being detained.\"\n\n\"The public deserves to know what is taking place in ICE facilities,\" Omar said. \n\nAt Saturday's protest, residents said they felt caught up in a political battle. Ellen Hinck, a teacher who attended the rally, said it's not surprising that Minnesota was targeted.\n\n\"The plan has been there. They are targeting blue states,\" Hinck said. \"They want to try and make us into what they want by using oppression. We are not going to let that happen.\" \n\nMinnesota was a political flashpoint before the shooting. Trump has made multiple verbal attacks on Gov. Tim Walz — former vice-president Kamala Harris's 2024 running mate in the presidential race — and derogatory remarks toward the state's Somali population.\n\nEli Wagar-Kustermann said he attended Saturday's rally to show solidarity. \n\n\"We are Minnesota strong,\" he said. \"You will not break us. You cannot break us.\"\n\nLike many others who attended the large protest, he said it's been unnerving seeing federal agents with their faces covered show up in parking lots and on residential streets. Before attending the rally, he took photos of ICE officers who he said were harassing people at a store.\n\n\"We are straight up under occupation,\" Wagar-Kustermann said. \n\nThis report by The Canadian Press was first published Jan. 10, 2026. \n\nKelly Geraldine Malone, The Canadian Press","url":"https://www.oakvillenews.org/national-news/you-cannot-break-us-protesters-rally-in-minneapolis-after-ice-fatal-shooting-11723429","image":"https://www.vmcdn.ca/f/files/shared/feeds/cp/2026/01/62d5bf3b9eac66430780be0fd341db7bf7275ae03861db58e2844c298940290f.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-11 05:44:07","author":"The Canadian Press","authors":["The Canadian Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.462},{"id":392278686,"title":"Saturday's Final Word","text":"Tabs, don't go away mad, tabs, just go away ...\n\n🔴 BREAKING:Tehran tonight.

May their freedom be at hand.\n\nSimon Sebag Montefiore at the Free Press: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran who occupies a role akin to a sacred monarch, issued a grave warning to the public on Friday. “Everyone knows the Islamic Republic came to power with the blood of hundreds of thousands of honorable people,” he said. “It will not back down in the face of saboteurs.”\n\nKhamenei defied Donald Trump, comparing him to the “tyrants & arrogant rulers of the world, such as Pharaoh, Nimrod, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi [the last shah] & other such rulers [who] saw their downfall when they were at the peak of their hubris. He too will fall.” His absence of self-awareness speaks of the regime’s isolation, delusion, and brutality. Khamenei has been a dictator since 1989, during which time he has brutally repressed multiple waves of protest with indiscriminate slaughter, rape, and public hangings, not to mention his role in wars in Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, and Iraq.\n\nWe are at a historic moment, a tilt in the world game and a rare spark of hope and excitement. The bravery of these Iranian protestors is awe-inspiring—particularly the women and girls, who have played a special courageous role. This time, among the greatest heroes are the heroines, personified in part by the dashing young woman who filmed herself lighting a cigarette with a burning photograph of the supreme leader. That is the spirit that is setting Iran aflame.\n\nEd: Bookmark this lengthy essay and read it carefully. It's a great history lesson, as well as a cautionary tale as well as reason to hope that this tyranny has just about breathed its last. The best part of this essay is an analysis of what a collapse of an Islamist regime might mean for the region – not a so-called Arab Spring that enables more radical Islamists, but the dismantling of a geopolitical order oriented to the Moscow-Beijing axis. \n\nCan you find me one “Free Palestine” charlatan demanding a Free Iran? pic.twitter.com/ZHApOqxLjU— John Ondrasik (@johnondrasik) January 10, 2026\n\nEd: Call it the Silence of the Shams.\n\nTelegraph (UK): A protester climbed onto the balcony of the Iranian embassy in London and tore down the regime’s flag.\n\nImages shared on social media showed the protester scaling the front of the building opposite Hyde Park before climbing onto a balcony and raising the “Lion and Sun” flag of Imperial Iran, which has long been banned by the regime. ...\n\nThe man was cheered by hundreds of opposition activists and their supporters who had gathered in front of the embassy, site of the famous siege of 1980 when an SAS unit stormed the building to liberate hostages taken by an armed group.\n\nEd: The historic resonance here is notable. Also, if a protester can manage to do this at the Iranian embassy, their security must be very concerned with other tasks. I wonder how much smoke is pouring out the chimney there as the IRGC intelligence officials destroy records and codes. \n\nIncredible stuff in London where the pre Islamic Republic flag has been hoisted over the embassy.📹@GhorbaniiNiyakpic.twitter.com/MwoJCxI3Qz— Nicole Lampert (@nicolelampert) January 10, 2026\n\nEd: This may be an iconic moment and image. Let's hope. \n\nWSJ: Israel and Hamas are preparing for renewed fighting as the Palestinian militant group is refusing to disarm, a requirement that is holding up progress on President Trump’s peace plan for Gaza. \n\nIsrael’s military has drawn up plans for a new ground operation inside Hamas-controlled territory in Gaza, according to people briefed on the plans. Hamas is focusing on rebuilding military capabilities lost during the war, including parts of its damaged tunnel infrastructure, Arab and Israeli officials said. The U.S.-designated terrorist group also has received a new influx of cash that has helped it regularly pay salaries to its fighters again, the officials said.\n\nEd: As everyone here knows, I've predicted this all along. I include it here because (a) it looks like the Israelis are about to finally act on Hamas' refusal to comply, and (b) the collapse of the regime in Tehran will come at the worst time possible for Hamas. \n\nWe’ve gone from gaslighting to full-on blowtorch at this point. The ICE agent told Good get out of the car, not leave. An outright lie MS Now is helping to push. https://t.co/tlnbUZlmfv— Joe Concha (@JoeConchaTV) January 10, 2026\n\nEd: Say, remember when M-SNOW insisted that the car never hit the ICE agent, too? They are making it up as they go along. \n\nScott Johnson at WashEx: Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) abandoned his ludicrous quest for a third term on Jan. 5. He has angrily refused to resign from office. Whenever he departs, whether upon his resignation some time this year or the expiration of his term early next year, we can say this much with certainty: Like former President Joe Biden, he has become a dispensable inconvenience to Democrats, in this case, Minnesota Democrats facing the 2026 elections at all levels of state government, and, like Biden, he will leave office in disgrace.\n\nTo say that Walz is the worst governor in Minnesota history does not come close to doing justice to his case. Like the children of Garrison Keillor’s fictional Lake Wobegon, our governors have mostly been above average, with a dip here and there. Walz has plumbed the depths of political turpitude while refusing to take responsibility for the catastrophe over which he at least bears supervisory responsibility. He is at best guilty of an old-fashioned kind of political corruption that has been magnified to the nth degree by an absurdly creative welfare state. We have never seen anything like it.\n\nEd: If Walz ever faces accountability for the massive fraud enabled by his administration, Scott will be one of the people who deserves the most credit for it. He has written about it for years. The media has finally begun to cover these stories, only because Scott and others forced the story into the national consciousness. For that, we may also have to thank Kamala Harris, ironically. \n\nThis whole protest in Minnesota was I think doomed to failure from the start, in large part because the crowd was made up overwhelmingly of upper class young white people. Scenes of affluent young white folk rioting aren’t good optics for the left and they know it… hard to argue… https://t.co/x30vHWpoAE— Enguerrand VII de Coucy (@ingelramdecoucy) January 10, 2026\n\nEd: It's also very cold in Minnesota in January. At noon today, it was 21 degrees outside with the wind chill taking it down to 7 degrees. However, I'd also guess that the release of the agent's cellphone video yesterday made this protest a lot harder to sustain. Plus, the usual suspects may be worried about Trump invoking the Insurrection Act.\n\nHollywood in Toto: Kimmel didn’t correct the record or otherwise indicate she was wrong. He’s not a journalist, per se, but by regularly wading into political matters he’s become part of the punditry class. He should know better, and he’s doing a disservice to his audience by not separating fact from fiction when possible.\n\nAnd who knows what other misinformation he’ll peddle next, all with a corrupt Legacy Media unwilling to call him out.\n\nIs Disney, Inc. proud of these broadcasts? Are they worried some will open them up to sizable lawsuits sooner or later?\n\nMore importantly, is anyone at Team Disney upset that their signature shows misinform at a delicate time in our Republic?\n\nIf silence is any indication, we have our answer.\n\nEd: My theory is that Kimmel took the proper message from his oddly short contract extension and knows Disney will dump him in the off-year when it expires. He wants Disney to fire him early so he can pose as a free-speech martyr. Maybe Disney's being smart by ignoring Kimmel while cutting his budget. \n\nThe demonization of the ICE officers LAWFUL RESPONSE TO HER CRIME is all in service of the effort to force the Trump Admin. to abandon its policy of mass deportations from the sancturary communities that are critical to holding onto voting advantages in elections, as well as…— Shipwreckedcrew (@shipwreckedcrew) January 10, 2026\n\n... as well as population counts done for the census.This is about DEMOCRATS WANTING TO REGAIN AND HOLD POLITICAL POWER.They really don't care about Ms. Good dying as a result of their hyperbolic exhortations. All in service of the cause -- which is power.\n\nEd: This is exactly what's happening. Democrats have opposed immigration enforcement for decades, and then threw open the border to make it even more difficult if and when Republicans took control of the White House. They didn't count on Trump's return, nor on his determination to reverse what Democrats did in the previous four years. \n\nLegal Insurrection: With protests surging across cities and towns across Iran, the regime has reportedly unleashed foreign fighters to crack down on protesters. The U.S. State Department raised the alarm about Lebanon’s Hezbollah and Iraqi terror militia set loose on Iranians.\n\n“The United States is concerned by reports that the Islamic Republic has employed Hezbollah terrorists and Iraqi militias to crack down on peaceful protests,” State Department’s Persian-language account on X said on Saturday.\n\nEd: There had been reports of the regime's proxies heading quickly to the home office, as it were.

None of these people were as vocal in their condemnation of this as they allowed pro-Hamas campus protests to fester across the nation for months. And when the U.S. tried to deport Mahmoud Khalil, a green card holder and Columbia University student for the exact same rhetoric, the Democrats went to court to keep Khalil. \n\nWhat changed in the last 48 hours that multiple prominent Democrats are suddenly concerned with their voter base loving Islamic terrorism that they'd all issue near-identical statements condemning it?

Don't know. But what I do know is this: the Democrats encouraged, supported, and cheered on the pro-Hamas protests since the fall of 2023. They've repeatedly radicalized their base against Jews and Israel, and believed that the antisemitic monster they created wouldn't end up biting them on the butt eventually.\n\nThere is no path to victory for the Democrats now. This condemnation will ring hollow with most voters who spent the past two years watching the Democrats dump on Israel, and it will anger their base, as the above replies demonstrate. Remember: Kamala Harris could've likely won Pennsylvania in 2024 if she had picked Shapiro as her running mate. She didn't, and it was likely because Shapiro is Jewish and was a member of the IDF.\n\nThe Democrats have a Hamas problem, and it's of their own making.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2026/01/10/the-hamas-problem-n2669262","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/51/1ea63ab4-eeb0-40b5-8605-c1ce455a59ea.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-11 00:00:21","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.322},{"id":392351624,"title":"Bob Weir, Grateful Dead founding member and a jam band icon, dies at 78","text":"Bob Weir, a founding member of the Grateful Dead whose rhythm guitar work, songwriting and tireless touring helped push traditional American blues and folk music into the modern era, has died, according to a statement posted Saturday to his official website. He was 78. The statement, also posted to social media, said Weir had been diagnosed with cancer in July and beat it but “succumbed to underlying lung issues.” “He transitioned peacefully, surrounded by loved ones, after courageously beating cancer as only Bobby could,” the statement said. Across more than six decades, Weir was one of music’s true road warriors, performing thousands of shows with almost a dozen bands. And though he often stood figuratively (and sometimes literally) in Jerry Garcia’s shadow, Weir eventually assumed the status of elder statesman of the “jam band” music genre that spun off from the Dead. Born in San Francisco in 1947, Weir gravitated to folk music in his teenage years. It was a chance encounter with Garcia in a Palo Alto, California, music store on New Year’s Eve 1963, when Weir was 16, that would start one of the most important friendships in rock history. Together, Garcia and Weir formed the basis for the Dead’s emergence as not just a band but as a counterculture unto itself. Weir’s early days of the Dead, which emerged from the psychedelic scene in the Haight-Ashbury neighborhood of San Francisco, are well chronicled as part of the rise of the hippie movement, most notably Ken Kesey’s “Acid Tests,” LSD-fueled parties at which the Dead performed. Though the band’s record sales were middling, the Dead’s aggressive touring regimen — combined with a policy that allowed fans to record shows and trade their favorite recordings — built a following that would grow organically over the decades. In the coming years, Garcia and Weir, initially a boyish figure next to his older and usually hairier bandmates, would become the faces of the Dead and its increasingly large cultural footprint. The two shared vocal duties while Weir’s rhythm guitar laid the foundation for Garcia’s now legendary improvisational playing. Weir penned some of the Dead’s most enduring songs, including “Jack Straw,” “Sugar Magnolia” and “Playing in the Band.” The band swerved across the music industry’s established lanes of short pop songs and thematic, marketing-friendly albums to create live, long-form journeys that matched the demands of psychedelia. “We didn’t make great records,” Weir said in an interview with journalist Dan Rather. “We were real good at playing live. And that’s what people wanted.” Weir’s bond with Garcia formed the core of the Dead, with Weir speaking of Garcia as a big brother. “They say that blood is thicker than water, and what we had was way thicker than blood,” Weir said of Garcia and the Dead in the interview with Rather. The Dead’s enduring popularity through the 1980s and early 1990s, thanks in large part to near-constant touring, kept Weir center stage. With cutoff jeans and tank tops, he became the closest thing the counterculture band had to a “heartthrob,” as The New Yorker once put it in a profile of the band. But Garcia’s health problems began to hamper the band. On Aug. 9, 1995, Weir stepped up to microphones to confirm reports that Garcia had died. For three more decades after Garcia's death, Weir played in various bands, some with other members of the Dead, some without. By the mid-1990s, a new crop of bands, including Phish, Widespread Panic, Blues Traveler and many others, had built on the Dead’s foundation to deliver various combinations of rock, blues, jazz, bluegrass and folk to live audiences. The jam band movement had taken shape, and Weir would remain firmly a part of it. That only sustained the popularity of the Dead’s music. In August, Weir’s most recent project, Dead & Company, which included longtime Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart and guitarist John Mayer, drew roughly 180,000 people over three shows at San Francisco’s Golden Gate Park. “Bob’s return to Golden Gate Park this past summer brought out the best of our city — music, community, and joy,\" San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie said Saturday in a statement on Weir's passing. Weir received a bevy of honors: Kennedy Center honors and induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Dead, the first Les Paul Spirit Award winner and a lifetime achievement award from the Americana Honors & Awards. Dead concert recordings have also maintained a cult following online, where nearly 18,000 digital files with concerts since 1965 are part of the Internet Archive. And while the Dead were not usually much for politics, Weir increasingly embraced liberal and progressive politics starting in the early 2000s and continuing through later years, when he endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz. He also dedicated time to philanthropic efforts, winning MusiCares’ Persons of the Year award last year along with Hart. California Gov. Gavin Newsom and his partner, Jennifer Siebel Newsom, called Weir in a joint statement Saturday night \"a true son of California\" who \"helped create the soundtrack of a generation.\" \"What set him apart was not just his music — it was his deep love for the people who heard it, his ability to connect with audiences as he shared stories that brought joy,\" the couple said. \"Weir was — and will always be — a king of psychedelic rock.\" At the other end of the country, the Empire State Building was lit up in tie-dye colors to memorialize Weir and the music that made the counterculture's trademark swirling pigmentation seem to dance. Seán Ono Lennon, son of Yoko Ono and John Lennon, reacted to Weir's death with a brief statement and a photo on X: \"He will be missed. Bob Weir R.I.P.\" A post on Bob Dylan's X account Saturday night featured a black-and-white photo of Weir, Garcia and Dylan performing onstage during the Bob Dylan and the Grateful Dead 1987 Tour. No words were included in the post. The Al Hirschfeld Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports cultural institutions in part by using income from exhibits of Hirschfeld's iconic cartoon sketches, posted a photo of a Hirschfeld rendition of the Grateful Dead from 1995 to memorialize Weir. The statement announcing Weir’s death said surviving loved ones Natascha, Monet and Chloe are thankful for the outpouring of love and asked that their privacy be respected. Weir is also survived by a handful of Grateful Dead bandmates, including drummers Hart and Bill Kreutzmann. “There is no final curtain here, not really,” the statement said. “Only the sense of someone setting off again. He often spoke of a three-hundred-year legacy, determined to ensure the songbook would endure long after him. May that dream live on through future generations of Dead Heads.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/obituaries/bob-weir-grateful-dead-founding-member-jam-band-icon-dies-78-rcna244713","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2026-01/260107-bob-weir-vl-934a-598fea.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 23:52:11","author":"David Ingram,Dennis Romero,Jason Abbruzzese","authors":["David Ingram","Dennis Romero","Jason Abbruzzese"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.363},{"id":392456672,"title":"How to make Republicans pay for this","text":"It’s still early as facts are coming in about the brutal killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Wood, by who shot in the head by an ICE agent in Minneapolis through the windshield of her car.\n\nWhat we do know, as we all can see with our own eyes on the viral videos of the killing, is that she was shot in cold-blood, unprovoked, not having put the ICE agent in any danger. This video analysis by The New York Times makes it clear.\n\nWe also know from reports that Renee, an American citizen originally from Colorado, was in a relationship with a woman who, in a gut-wrenching video, identified herself as Renee’s wife. In a video obtained by The Advocate, a woman at the scene is sobbing:\n\n“They killed my wife. I don’t know what to do,” the woman says through sobs in the footage, with a damaged SUV visible in the distance behind her. “We stopped to videotape, and they shot her in the head,” the woman cries.“We have a 6-year-old at school,” she says, almost unable to breathe, as a chaotic scene in which federal officers prevented at least one doctor who was on the scene from assisting the shot victim unfolds. “We’re new here,” the distraught woman says in despair.\n\nOn Renee’s social media accounts, which included Pride emojis, Renee described herself as a “wife and mom,” according to the AP, which noted that her six-year-old child is from a previous marriage to a man—a second marriage—and that he had two teenage children with a first husband.\n\nRenee’s mother, Donna Ganger, told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that Renee “was extremely compassionate. She’s taken care of people all her life. She was loving, forgiving, and affectionate.” Ganger said Renee lived with her “partner” a few blocks away from where she was killed. Some media aren’t reporting anything about Renee’s wife (or partner) and are even saying her six-year-old child is “orphaned.”\n\nBut Fox news is certainly on top of it, all to demonize her—dehumanize her—as a queer woman.\n\nThe demonization began, however, with Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, who falsely claimed ice agents were under attack by protestors—“domestic terrorists”—while their cars were stuck in snow.\n\nThere was no snow event—hadn’t been a snowfall for days—in Minneapolis and the streets were clear, as we could see from the video, in which the ICE vehicle drove up to Renee’s car, at which points agents got out as she attempted to drive away while one tried to open her door and another shot her in the head through the windshield from just to the side of the front of the car. Again, the New York Times analysis of the video shows this, as do analyses of other news organizations.\n\nNoem falsely claimed Renee tried to “ram” the agent, and that Renee was a “domestic terrorist,” who caused the agent to have to go to the hospital—even though we can see in the video he was unharmed and walked away, then got in his car and drove off. This vile dog-killing cretin of an Homeland Security Secretary is the epitome of all that ugly and fraudulent in the Trump administration. The demonization of a mother, a wife, a daughter, an innocent woman, as a domestic terrorist is truly repugnant.\n\nAnd it only got worse as the hordes on social began defaming Renee, and then it hit Fox News. Jesse Watters, an odious presence on Fox who makes jokes out of brutality, made some absolutely repulsive comments meant to completely dehumanize Renee.\n\nDescribing her as a “self-proclaimed poet” he’s telegraphing to the MAGA masses, who have been nurtured by MAGA’s anti-intellectualism, that she’s one of those dangerous “elites” and thus must be guilty of something. And if that won’t convince them, well, she has the dreaded, “pronouns in her bio,” so she must be dangerous.\n\nAnd she has a “lesbian partner,” so she’s not a real person, not like the rest of us, but one of them. (It takes back to the Trump super PAC ad during the 2024 campaign showing Kamala Harris supporting trans rights and proclaiming, “Kamala is for they/them. Trump is for you.”).\n\nThis is how a fascist regime works. They kill people and then push propaganda, claiming the person deserved it. And on top of that, they demonize the victim as one of those “undesirable” people who deserved it anyway, someone less than human.\n\nThere were huge protests in Minneapolis last night and across the country, as there should be. This ICE thug must be prosecuted, though the Trump regime will do everything they can to protect him—and Trump will pardon him, as he’ll have to be convicted under federal charges.\n\nBut no matter, we must make the GOP pay for it, bringing the message to the American people, and organizing for the mid-terms to take our government back from the authoritarian regime. And we’ll do it in the name of all the thousands who’ve brutalized—many of them far out of sight—like Renee.","summary":"It’s still early as facts are coming in about the brutal killing of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Macklin Wood, by who shot in the head by an ICE agent in Minneapolis through the windshield of her car.\n\nWhat we do know, as we all can see with our own eyes on the viral videos of the killing, is that she was shot in cold-blood, unprovoked, not having put the ICE agent in any danger.

Sign up for their newsletters.\n\nLast month, as required by law, State Auditor Grant Parks published an annual report on state programs and agencies that his office deems to be at “high risk” of costly inefficiency, waste or fraud.\n\nThe report reiterated concerns about seven situations, two of which have been on the list since 2007, including the bureaucracy’s chronic inability to successfully employ information technology — embarrassing for a state that is the global center for digital tools.\n\nParks has added a new program in his latest overview, the Department of Social Service’s food aid for poor families, once called food stamps but now known as CalFresh.\n\nThe federal government primarily finances supplemental food benefits, but the state’s share is determined, in part, by its management, as indicated by its rate of error when determining people’s eligibility.\n\nPresident Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill tightens the error rate thresholds. Thus, Parks notes, California’s 11% error rate, if not improved, could require the state to “spend about $2 billion annually to maintain CalFresh benefits.”\n\nThe most disturbing item on Parks’ list is the continuing inability of the Employment Development Department to effectively manage unemployment insurance benefits, which first came to light during the COVID-19 pandemic. Billions of dollars in fraudulent benefit claims were approved, almost all of which came in a federally financed expansion of the program.\n\nBy happenstance, the high risk report was released just as a scandal was erupting in Minnesota over widespread fraud in a program meant to keep children fed during the pandemic.\n\nDozens of people, mostly in Minnesota’s substantial Somali population, have been charged with looting the program by setting up companies that billed the state for supplying food that was never delivered.\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz, whom Kamala Harris chose as her running mate in her campaign for president in 2024, felt the political fallout from the scandal — generated mostly in right-leaning media outlets — and this week dropped his bid for re-election.\n\nMeanwhile, those same outlets — blogs, podcasts and YouTube videos — have been making an accusatory connection between the Minnesota scandal and the Parks report, suggesting the report proves the same kind of fraud was even more rampant in California and laying the blame on Gov. Gavin Newsom, who’s a likely 2028 candidate for president.\n\nThis week, Steve Hilton, a Republican candidate for California governor, and Herb Morgan, a Republican running for state controller, cited the Parks report, their own research and tips from whistleblowers in a broad assertion, dubbed “CALIFRAUDIA,” that “California’s exposure to fraud, waste, and abuse across major state programs is likely to reach $250 billion,” adding that it “underscores the urgent need for formal investigation and audit, as a matter of basic fiscal responsibility.”\n\nHowever, the allegations of widespread fraud and mismanagement during Newsom’s governorship is not confined to those on the starboard side of the political balance beam.\n\nRo Khanna, a progressive Democratic member of Congress from Silicon Valley who could be a rival to Newsom in the 2028 presidential sweepstakes, issued a similar blast in a posting on X, albeit with a smaller $72 billion pricetag, citing Parks’ report and other data.\n\nKhanna told Politico, “I don’t know what the specific number is” of dollars lost to fraud or mismanagement. “It’s not particular to any person,” Khanna said. “It’s making government more effective. Tackling the mismanagement and waste and some fraud will build more credibility for asking for higher taxes.”\n\nNewsom’s staff responded by accusing Khanna of making a “MAGA made-up claim.”\n\nThere’s a reason why veterans of political wars refer to election years as the “silly season,” when political figures seeking media attention are prone to convert anthills of fact into mountains of rhetorical fantasy.\n\nCalMatters is a nonpartisan and nonprofit news organization bringing Californians stories that probe, explain and explore solutions to quality of life issues while holding our leaders accountable.\n\nWant to submit a letter to the editor, guest column or opinion piece?

Rudy Perpich. The insurrectionist echoes of their language about immigration-enforcement cops are eyebrow-raising in the same week the elitist media somberly mourned the attack on police at the Jan. 6 riot.\n\nOn Jan. 7, activist Renee Nicole Good used her car to try and block traffic to resist ICE agents. When she refused requests to step out of the car and instead drove her car into an ICE agent, the agent shot her.\n\nThat’s a terrible thing. But so was the shooting of activist Ashli Babbitt by a policeman on Jan. 6.\n\nHow is running over ICE agents not like threatening the Capitol Police on Jan. 6?\n\nIf you don’t believe ICE agents were in danger, then maybe you should read about how Cuban illegal alien Juan Carlos Rodriguez Romero “interacted” with ICE agents last Dec. 21.\n\nOn Jan. 5, a Justice Department press release noted when ICE agents initiated a traffic stop with Romero in St. Paul, he “refused to obey commands and attempted to flee in his car.” He accelerated his car toward ICE officers who were on foot. He then lost control of his car, and ICE tried to apprehend him a second time. \n\nRomero again accelerated his car and struck one officer. When ICE officers actually apprehended him, he “bit one of the officers, drawing blood. Two ICE officers were transported to the hospital, suffering from bruised ribs, a dislocated finger, and a bite wound.”\n\nLast September, an illegal alien ran over and dragged an ICE agent in Chicago until ICE shot him dead.\n\nBut there was no sympathy for the dragged agent. \n\nCNN and the rest of the press treated that as ICE brutality, absolving the violent cop-dragging. WBEZ, the Chicago NPR station, openly promoted assisting the ICE resisters: “Here’s how you can help us track where ICE agents are being deployed in Chicago.”\n\nThe Democrats align themselves with violent leftists resisting ICE. “Get the f—- out of Minneapolis,” proclaimed Mayor Jacob Frey after Good was killed.\n\nGov. Tim Walz suggested he’d deploy the National Guard: “I’ve issued a warning order to prepare the Minnesota National Guard. We have soldiers in training and prepared to be deployed, if necessary.”\n\nMinnesota Democrats openly allied themselves with Somali Americans who defrauded the federal government of billions of dollars. When Team Trump drew attention to this massive fraud, Walz called it “white supremacy.”\n\nThese radical stances underline the wokeness, or the “anti-racism” of Democrats and their affiliated media outlets, who see everything through a lens of oppressive “white privilege.” It’s precisely this wokeness that enabled the massive fraud in the first place, and which now seeks to disable any attempt at deportations.\n\nWill these stances hurt the Democrats statewide in Minnesota? \n\nThey already caused Walz to drop out, and Sen. Tina Smith is retiring, so there’s open seats, and Kamala Harris only won the state by four points. Will it hurt Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan in the Senate race?\n\nShe recently demonstrated her wokeness by donning a hijab in a video released on Christmas and proclaiming solidarity with our Somali “immigrant neighbors.”\n\nWokeness damaged Kamala Harris in 2024, but Democrats can’t seem to curb their pandering to illegal immigrants and Somali fraudsters. The “mainstream” media stand with the Democrat extreme on these issues, promoting Frey and Walz and Attorney General Keith Ellison and the rest. But biased media voices —hailing their rants as “powerful”—can’t always ensure victory.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2026 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

The suspect is claiming self-defense while Florida police investigate.\n\nThe shooting comes at a difficult time for the Secret Service, which has struggled with manpower issues and low morale for more than a decade. Recruiting and retention took further hits after the two assassination attempts against President Trump in 2024, when many senior agents who had hit retirement age left the agency amid harsh criticism from the public and Congress over the myriad failures in both attempts on Trump’s life.\n\nThe agency has recently touted improvements in its recruiting efforts after offering $40,000-$60,000 of dollars in recruiting bonuses, but has not responded to repeated RealClearPolitics inquiries about its retention rates. Earlier this week, Secret Service Director Sean Curran met with United Marine Corps Sergeant Major Carlos Ruiz to collaborate on ways Marines could continue service to their country after leaving the military.\n\nThis week, the Secret Service announced plans to hire 4,000 employees over the next two years and cut its hiring timelines in half. But long-time observers warned that speeding up the hiring process would undoubtedly result in less training and the hiring of less qualified individuals.\n\nUntil the investigation into the killing concludes, the Broward County Sheriff’s Office is not releasing the suspect’s name. RealClearPolitics is withholding the suspects’ and victims’ names until the Broward County State Attorney’s Office determines whether to file criminal charges.\n\nFlorida has a robust “stand-your-ground” law, which allows individuals to use reasonable, even deadly, force to defend themselves from imminent threats or death or serious harm without a legal duty to retreat.\n\nShortly after 10 p.m. on Dec. 31, Broward County Regional Communications received a report of a shooting in the Tamarac, Florida area.\n\nWhen police and fire rescue arrived, they located a 16-year-old male, who had been shot. The juvenile was airlifted to Broward Health Medical Center, where he was later pronounced dead. An adult woman suffered a graze wound and was treated at the scene, the sheriff’s office said. The shooter remained on the scene, was detained for questioning, “presented a self-defense claim,” and was later released.\n\nThe Secret Service hired the suspect in late fall, and he was scheduled to begin agent training at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in early to mid-January.\n\n“The United States Secret Service is aware of an open investigation by the Broward County Sheriff’s Office that involves a recently hired special agent trainee, who was awaiting entry into an upcoming training academy,” the agency said in a statement to RCP. “This is an extremely tragic situation, and we are fully cooperating with the Broward Sheriff’s Office as they lead this investigation.\n\n“Once completed, the results of the independent review will be presented to the Florida State Attorney’s Office,” the agency continued. “… Any additional questions related to the investigation itself should be directed to the Broward Sheriff’s Office. The employee under investigation has been placed on administrative leave as the process moves forward.” \n\nFormer agents and other sources in the Secret Service community have recently criticized the agency for lowering standards in recruiting, arguing that misplaced DEI initiatives were given priority during the Obama and Biden administrations, and former law enforcement experience was not valued as much as in previous years, when the agency had a better reputation and protection record.\n\nSome have also argued that Curran isn’t doing enough to rid the agency of DEI hires and woke culture, which one agent has publicly blamed for the near-killing of Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nOther agents have raised concerns over the Secret Service’s decades-long policy of not requiring psychological exams as part of the hiring process – unlike most police departments across the country. Doing so would prevent any type of insider threats to the president or other protectees, these sources argue.\n\nMany of these complaints have circulated for more than a decade. Former GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz, who served as the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, held numerous hard-hitting hearings on the failures of the Secret Service after the 2012 Colombia prostitution scandal involving several agents who were caught with prostitutes during the Obama administration. Chaffetz was also highly critical of several White House fence-jumping incidents – so much so that the fence surrounding the complex was raised.\n\nIn 2015, Chaffetz and committee staff also produced a detailed, bipartisan report on “The Secret Service in Crisis,” which recommended numerous reforms, many of which the agency has yet to implement. \n\nThree months before the assassination attempt against Trump in Butler, RCP reported on a female agent’s mental health meltdown and physical attack on her supervisor, which took place at Joint Base Andrews, before a planned trip protecting then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nLast year, the agency spent $2 million on a Super Bowl recruitment video by Hollywood producer Michael Bay in which Curran is prominently featured. The expenditure came after hundreds of agents applied for lateral transfer to the Drug Enforcement Agency.\n\nThe agents are working harder than ever at what many argue is an unsustainable pace after the previous acting director, Ron Rowe, promised “a paradigm shift” post-Butler – that they would not have to continue “doing more with less,” a common refrain in the Secret Service over the last decade.\n\nThe vice-presidential detail is especially taxed because JD Vance travels much more than his predecessor, Kamala Harris, but the agency has kept the number of agents assigned to it at similar levels. One source tells RCP that vice presidential agents work five to six days a week, while Trump’s detail works two to three days.\n\nSusan Crabtree is RealClearPolitics' national political correspondent.","summary":"Anew Secret Service agent recruit shot and killed his 16-year-old half-brother and may have been responsible for another bullet grazing a woman's face on New Year's Eve.

M. Barrie, one either believes in fairies, or they don’t. I take a similar approach to Rory Stewart. To his legions of Rest is Politics listeners, the ex-Tory MP, bedroom-squatter, and Afghanistan-botherer is a sage – as right-wing a voice as their timid and tiny middle-class minds can handle, successfully neutralised by co-hosting with 45-minute enthusiast Alistair Campbell. But to me he is a charlatan: another over-educated Balliol boy with a far higher opinion of himself than his public record merits. The example of his Dominic Cummings comments is a case in point.\n\nFor those unfamiliar, a Stewart rant from June last year about the former No. 10 adviser is currently doing the rounds on Twitter. In it, the Temu Lawrence of Arabia accuses Cummings of all manner of sins: being a child, a conspiracy theorist, a serial name-dropper who makes a deal about having seen classified information to cosy up to Silicon Valley tech bros and the Emiratis. In his moralising, Stewart specifically hones in on a comment Cummings had made about elites in the UAE not sending their children to Britain over fears of radicalisation.\n\nBeing Gary Linker’s anointed ‘Middle East Expert’, Stewart naturally felt able to dismiss this suggestion as nonsense. To suggest Britain might have a problem with Islamic extremism – or that Cummings might have a point – would be far too likely to scare the listeners, an unnecessary reflection of the reality of Britain today that would upset those tuning in from Verbier and Tuscany. But the inconvenient truth for Stewart is that Cummings – not for the first time, m’lud – was right.\n\nThe Financial Times has reported that the United Arab Emirates has removed the UK from its list of student destinations eligible for subsidies. The decision is apparently ‘linked to anxiety in the UAE over what it sees as the risk of Islamist radicalisation on UK campuses’, with an Emirati source quoted as saying that they ‘don’t want their kids to be radicalised on campus’. A particular point of contention is Labour’s failure to proscribe the Muslim Brotherhood. Stephen Daisley has more.\n\nWhen this was suggested by Cummings, it was easily dismissed. When it crops up in the Davos paper of record, it is rather more difficult to brand it misinformation, fake news, conspiracy theorising or whatever else is this week’s luvvie term du jour. Accordingly, Stewart has apologised. Alas, an ‘emergency podcast’ is not thought to be incoming.\n\nWhat is surprising about this whole affair is not that Cummings was right and Stewart was wrong. Nor is it that the UAE considers Britain a hotbed of radicalisation – hardly surprising, with our recent record. What is remarkable is that anyone still takes Stewart seriously. He is the same galaxy brain who predicted that Kamala Harris would win the presidency by a landslide; the same supposed man of principle who flounced out of parliament when the Conservative party had the temerity not to make him prime minister. His only redeeming feature as a public figure is his willingness to take one for the collective team and serve as his podcast’s second-worst host.\n\nStewart is a midwit’s idea of a clever person: sufficiently posh, diffident and CV-ed to convince that he speaks from a position of authority, but without any proven record of accuracy. Those listening to his podcast are far greater victims of misinformation than the supposed ‘low-information voters’ that they so palpably loathe. Anyone sufficiently sadomasochistic to be a Rest is Politics subscriber should save their money, and tune into Cummings’s recent Quite Right turn instead. They might be shocked to find they actually learn something. It is time they stopped believing in fairies.","url":"https://spectator.com/article/why-does-anyone-still-take-rory-stewart-seriously/","image":"https://spectator.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Screenshot-2024-11-06-at-06.06.01-1.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 15:24:46","author":"William Atkinson","authors":["William Atkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":392261254,"title":"Manasseh: Ofori-Atta&#039;s arrest was targeted","text":"Investigative journalist Manasseh Azure Awuni has provided details surrounding the arrest of Ghana’s former Finance Minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, in the United States, describing the operation as a targeted arrest.\n\nSpeaking on The Big Issue on Channel One TV on Saturday, January 10, 2026, Manasseh said sources who witnessed the arrest confirmed that Mr Ofori-Atta was picked up at the Westlight building, located at 1111 24th Street in Northwest Washington, D.C.\n\nHe explained that the Westlight building is a high-end residential complex situated in one of Washington, D.C.’s most expensive neighbourhoods, about a 20-minute walk from the White House, where the former minister reportedly lives with his wife and son.\n\nAccording to Manasseh, the facility is known to house prominent personalities. He noted that former United States Vice President Kamala Harris previously lived in the same building before moving out after her election, selling her two-bedroom apartment for about $1.85 million at the time.\n\nHe added that while it is unclear whether Mr Ofori-Atta owns or rents the apartment, sources indicate that he had been living there until the morning of January 6, when authorities reportedly surrounded the building and took him into custody.\n\nManasseh further disclosed that the arrest occurred at about 11 a.m. on Tuesday as the former finance minister was exiting the building.\n\n“He was arrested at the Westlight building, which is located at 1111,24th Street in Northwest Washington, D.C., and we are told this is a very expensive residential area in Washington, D.C., located about 20 minutes’ walk from the White House.\n\n“Some of the people who have lived in this facility include the immediate past Vice President of the United States, Kamala Harris. She had a two-bedroom apartment in this building and moved out when she was elected Vice President. We know the cost of that facility, I mean, the two-bedroom apartment in that complex, she sold it for $1.85 million at the time she was leaving.\n\n“So we’re told it’s a very expensive facility, secure, and prominent people live there. We don’t know whether Ken Ofori-Atta has bought the facility or he’s renting, but sources say this is where he’s been living, going in and out, until the morning of January 6, when the authorities surrounded him and drove him to his current detention centre,” he said.\n\nHe added that the manner of the arrest suggests it was a targeted operation, noting that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is typically associated with mass arrests in public places.\n\n“When we talk about ICE, I think those who watch foreign news and sometimes social media, these officials go around to enforce the immigration policy of the US. So most of their activity, sometimes they go to public places, factories, and other places to do mass sweeps and arrests. But in the case of Ken Ofori-Atta, we are hearing it was like a targeted operation.\n\n“It wasn’t like a mass sweep, and as we know, this is a high-end residential complex. So it appears they went there purposely to arrest him, and once they got him into the car, they moved,”he added.","url":"https://citinewsroom.com/2026/01/manasseh-ofori-attas-arrest-was-targeted/","image":"https://citinewsroom.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Manasseh-Azure.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 15:18:37","author":"Isaac Appiah-Kubi","authors":["Isaac Appiah-Kubi"],"language":"en","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.362},{"id":392267634,"title":"GREGG JARRETT: If Walz is charged in Minnesota fraud scandal, his best defense is incompetence","text":"\"I hereby plead incompetence and stupidity.\" That’s probably the best defense that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz can offer if he is criminally charged in the shocking multi-billion-dollar taxpayer ripoffs that grow larger by the day. Given his earned reputation, his excuse of incompetence would be credible. Nearly every social service program receiving federal dollars was fleeced by fraudsters right under Walz’s nose, including child nutrition, daycare, healthcare, housing, and autism aid. Most of the perpetrators were Somalians who form a powerful voting block that the governor treasures like gold. EMMER WARNS WALZ COULD END UP 'IN CUFFS' AMID MINNESOTA FRAUD CLAIMS Walz was repeatedly warned of the swindles as far back as 2019 when he first took office. Instead of stopping the scams and prosecuting the grifters, he indulged them by establishing a culture of permissible fraud. The scandal has already claimed Walz’s political career, forcing him to abandon his bid for re-election. But if he reckoned that quitting would somehow shield him from legal culpability, he is mistaken. There is mounting evidence that Walz was willfully complicit, deliberately refusing to expose or pursue the monumental thefts and, instead, launching aggressive measures to scuttle any legal scrutiny and criminal consequence. The governor’s own state workers at the Department of Human Services issued a blistering statement blaming him as 100% responsible. Witnesses say he retaliated against whistleblowers and schemed to discredit the well-documented fraud reports. WALZ’S LONG-RUNNING FRAUD SCANDAL PUTS HARRIS CAMPAIGN JUDGMENT UNDER SCRUTINY If true, Walz’s aberrant actions run dangerously close to criminal behavior involving cover-ups and obstruction. Nine federal agencies, including the FBI, are now working to unravel the full breadth and depth of the colossal cons. The Department of Justice (DOJ) has sent scores of investigators and lawyers to Minnesota to prosecute the web of fraud and deceit. They will inevitably weigh whether Walz should face criminal charges himself. MINNESOTA AG BLASTS HOUSE HEARING ON FRAUD SCANDAL IN HIS STATE : 'A LOT OF BULLS--- FROM REPUBLICANS' Possible Federal Charges There are several federal statutes to consider. For example, 18 USC 371 makes it a crime to conspire with others to defraud the government. At present, there is no known evidence that Walz directly participated in the scams themselves or accepted money. However, if he plotted to cover up the fraud by impairing, obstructing or defeating efforts to bring the fraudsters to justice, the conspiracy statute is applicable. So, too, are the various obstruction of justice laws. JASON CHAFFETZ: DEMOCRATS TURNED OUR TREASURY INTO A ‘PIGGY BANK FOR FRAUDSTERS’ There is also 18 USC 2, the aiding and abetting statute where accomplices are treated the same as the main perpetrators. That law gave rise to the \"willful blindness doctrine\" recognized by our courts. An example is a businessman who intentionally ignores or turns a blind eye to his partner’s money laundering, resulting in charges against both. Similarly, a public official such as Walz can be indicted for deliberate inaction where he has a clear duty to act. Finally, 18 USC 3 is relevant whenever concealment occurs. Whoever knows that a crime has been committed but \"hinders apprehension, trial or punishment,\" is guilty of being an accessory after the fact. That bears a striking resemblance to what Walz is accused of doing. FROM CONGRESS, TO VP NOMINEE TO DISGRACED FORMER GOVERNOR: A LOOK AT THE RISE AND FALL OF TIM WALZ All of this invites the question of the governor’s motive. If not money, how did he stand to benefit by suppressing the avalanche of fraud? That’s the easy part. Votes. Walz, together with liberal elites and their media handmaidens, have long dismissed the rumors and reports of Somali-engineered fraud as \"racist.\" Apparently, in Minnesota it is politically incorrect to enforce the law against immigrants from that particular East African country. It’s just not fashionable. God forbid that putting criminals behind bars might lose electoral support. It’s chic to turn the other cheek. REP TOM EMMER: WALZ OVERSAW BILLIONS IN STOLEN TAXPAYER MONEY — NOW COMES ACCOUNTABILITY So, the Somalian fraudsters were gifted a \"get-out-of-jail\" free card, courtesy of the governor and his cronies. Walz, in turn, secured their votes. It was a nifty quid pro quo, but with an alternate currency — votes. As protection rackets go, it was slick. That cozy arrangement is manifested in a recently uncovered audio recording of a 2021 conversation between Walz’s Attorney General Keith Ellison and Somali hustlers who were soon after convicted of scamming millions of dollars. They were heard leaning hard on the AG to \"protect\" them in exchange for support and campaign donations. Ellison eagerly capitulated but now denies any wrongdoing. He returned the cash. Walz’s Incompetence Defense It is too early to know whether a criminal case will be filed against Minnesota’s beleaguered governor. The U.S. attorney and DOJ lawyers are still digging through the mountains of evidence. However, as noted above, the only tenable defense Walz may be able to conjure up is incompetence and stupidity. It is something that jurors might readily accept. SCATHING AUDIT REVEALS MORE FRAUD CONCERNS INSIDE TOP MINNESOTA AGENCY WITH FABRICATED DOCUMENTS, 'MISCONDUCT' After all, ineptitude became the governor’s calling card. He infamously conceded his own buffoonery in the 2024 Vice Presidential debate when he called himself a \"knucklehead.\" He was such a gaffe factory that the Kamala Harris campaign squirreled him away from the media. Walz achieved the impossible. He made his running mate look like a genius. His bizarre on-stage antics were constant fodder for mockery. Baffling verbal goofs, such as boasting that he had \"become friends with school shooters,\" left voters scratching their heads or snickering. A series of demonstrable lies about his military service and his peculiar treks to China only compounded the impression of a man who is either a serial fabricator or not right in the head. Maybe both are true. And who can forget his epic bungling of the George Floyd riots in 2020? He radicalized the tragic death, thereby ginning up the ensuing violence. As Minneapolis burned, Walz dithered. Afterwards, he blamed the looting and the torched buildings on systemic racism.

Tim Walz pulled out the smears last May at a law-school graduation. The agents of Immigrations and Custom Enforcement (ICE) were \"Trump’s modern-day Gestapo,\" \"scooping folks up off the streets.\" It had been Joe Biden’s ICE just four months earlier. How quickly can an agency descend into fascism? The national broadcast networks never found that objectionable or newsworthy. The \"independent fact-checkers\" yawned. Comparing President Donald Trump to Hitler is 24/7 Democrat messaging. Comparing law-enforcement agencies to storm troopers is perfectly fine – when the Democrats aren’t in charge of them. It’s become clear that Democrats from Walz on down don’t just oppose mass deportation. They oppose any deportations. They don’t welcome cooperation with ICE. They push resistance against ICE. Because ICE is now relentlessly demonized, it shouldn’t be surprising that they’ve been on the receiving end of violence. The broadcast networks yawn. In September in Chicago, an illegal alien ran over and dragged an ICE agent in Chicago until the alien was shot dead. But there was no sympathy for the dragged agent on ABC, CBS, NBC or PBS. COLBERT WARNS TRUMP ADMINISTRATION IS IMPOSING AN 'OBEY OR DIE' DOCTRINE ON AMERICANS Last December in St. Paul, Minn., an illegal alien allegedly ran over an ICE agent and bit another agent when he was apprehended. The national networks showed they don’t care. They didn’t bring that up after the latest incident. The death of Renee Nicole Good when she threatened to drive into an ICE agent is a tragedy. If activists like Good wanted to protest ICE by showing up wherever they seek to enforce the law and film it on their phones, that’s in our First Amendment tradition. But it’s a crime to get involved in trying to impede law enforcement activity. Everyone knew how the broadcast networks would cover this death, with massive energy and outrage. That didn’t happen for women killed by illegal immigrants. We can guess the elitist media would say these murders were atypical for illegal immigrants. But using that logic, apparently ICE shooting a protester is typical for them? ICE AGENTS REPORT ‘UNPRECEDENTED’ 3,200% SURGE IN CAR ATTACKS LAST YEAR The broadcast networks didn’t care about 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray being raped and murdered, or the rape and murder of Maryland mom Rachel Morin. When they gave 20 minutes to the trial of Laken Riley’s illegal-immigrant killer last November, it paled in comparison to the 78 minutes the networks gave a little-known comedian at a Trump rally last October calling Puerto Rico \"a floating island of garbage.\" They were all trying to get former Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz into the White House. Not everyone let Democrats rant without a challenge, like Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey demanding ICE \"get the f--- out of Minneapolis.\" Newly minted \"CBS Evening News\" anchor Tony Dokoupil asked Frey: \"The rhetoric we just heard, other things you have said, you've now got protesters in the streets saying things like ‘Nazis go home.’ How are you helping the situation calm down?\" Frey basically said he won’t: \"What I appreciate about this situation right now is we in Minneapolis are all singing with one accord, which is, one, we are going to stand up for our immigrant community. Two, we are going to keep people safe.\" Democrats routinely call illegal immigrants \"our neighbors,\" our \"immigrant community,\" and describe opposing deportation as \"keeping people safe.\" Frey and the others say ICE isn’t stopping crime, it’s engaged in crime, it’s \"sowing chaos.\" Radicals impeding ICE activity aren’t engaged in chaos, but in \"keeping people safe.\" All of that sounds Orwellian. But don’t call activists like Good \"radical.\" The press pretends she was \"just a mom.\" On NBC’s \"Today,\" reporter Maggie Vespa broke out the \"without evidence\" claim: \"The Trump administration defending his actions, including Vice President JD Vance in a rare appearance in the White House Briefing Room saying without evidence that [Renee] Good was radicalized ... white local officials, including the city's mayor, dispute the Trump administration's narrative.\" CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION Whenever these networks say \"without evidence,\" it’s because they didn’t look. The New York Post reported Good was an anti-ICE \"warrior\" who sent her son to Southside Family Charter School, a K-5 academy opened in 1972 that, from its inception, has been \"unabashedly dedicated to social justice education.\" Everyone knew how the broadcast networks would cover this death, with massive energy and outrage. That didn’t happen for women killed by illegal immigrants. The broadcast networks didn’t just rant against Trump and ICE on the newscasts. Speaking of Venezuela, ABC \"comedian\" Jimmy Kimmel brought out a red T-shirt, \"They’re trying out a new slogan: ‘DONALD J. TRUMP IS GONNA KILL YOU.’ Pretty good, right?\" Moving on to Minneapolis, Kimmel retorted, \"This maniac, he isn't just killing people overseas. An ICE agent today shot and killed an unarmed 37-year-old woman during an ICE operation in Minneapolis, who were there under the guise of protecting us.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP On ABC’s \"The View,\" they took their loathing of Trump to a new level, scaring their own audience after the Minneapolis shooting. Cohost Whoopi Goldberg asserted, \"That young lady could have been anybody in this audience. It doesn't matter what — forget color. Forget everything. It could have been anybody, and if they can do this to her, they can do it to you, too.\" You can count on these networks to avoid left-wing rhetorical excess – when they’re not engaged in it. Accounts on X circulated video of a protest in New York’s Foley Square where they chanted \"Kristi Noem will Hang!\" and \"Save a life, kill an ICE!\" You might call it the spirit of the post-George Floyd riots of 2020 and the networks won’t disparage it. They’ll use it to announce \"growing outrage tonight\" against ICE and Trump.

[Checks out the ol’ news.] Ah well.\n\nWe may be a little rusty, so bear with us. This week, Donald Trump fantasized about which Western Hemisphere landmasses he can conquer next. Tim Walz can’t catch a break ever since he inserted himself into national politics. A solution for expired health care subsidies remains mired in the limbo of a dreaded Senate working group.\n\nAnd while we were hoping to lead with a “fun one” in this return edition, that wasn’t in the cards.\n\nStephen Miller\n\nICE is becoming too big to fail.\n\nOn Wednesday in Minnesota, 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good was in her car, perpendicular to traffic, during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement operation in Minneapolis. An agent approached her and demanded she get out of the car. As that officer began trying to open her door, another approached from the other side. Good tried to drive away, turning her wheels right to avoid the officer who had approached from the other side. As the officer tried to get out of the way, he fired multiple shots from feet away and killed Good. We can’t predict how a court of law would judge the officer’s self-defense argument. But the naked eye tells that this was an overuse of force.\n\nThis administration, though, can’t afford you believing the naked eye. It has a lot riding on ICE. Anti-immigrant zealot Stephen Miller, who runs White House policy—or, really, just runs the White House—pushed with all of his might to secure a mammoth expansion of ICE capacity and personnel in last summer’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. A supersized ICE is Miller’s tool to implement mass deportations. And so, a scandal in which an ICE officer unnecessarily shoots someone in the face, which could threaten public support for Miller’s grand ICE project, is not something the administration can afford.\n\nThis is why the administration went from zero to she was a terrorist in about 10 seconds. Miller described Good’s driving as “domestic terrorism,” intended to run over officers, a line echoed by the Department of Homeland Security’s spokesperson and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem herself. Vice President J.D. Vance performed a hammy scolding of the media for daring to question the officer’s actions during Thursday’s White House press briefing. The response was quick and well over-the-top. It was high-stakes crisis communications to protect Miller’s dream for America.\n\nDonald Trump\n\nWe really shouldn’t buy Greenland, either.\n\nFeeling his imperialist oats after having kidnapped a head of state so that he could take the country’s natural resources, Trump has once again turned his attention to Greenland, a large ice sheet controlled by the Kingdom of Denmark that Trump wants to annex because it looks really big on a distorted map. Trump reiterated early in the week that “we need Greenland” and his press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, observed that “utilizing the U.S. military is always an option” that Trump could use to secure it. Our good friend Stephen Miller, meanwhile, gave a characteristically unhinged interview, saying that the U.S. has a right to take Greenland because “we live in a world, in the real world … that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power. These are the iron laws of the world since the beginning of time.” Buddy, this is CNN, not an Xbox headset.\n\nAt least there’s been reasonable pushback, with European leaders formally condemning the saber-rattling and observing that an attack on Greenland would mean the end of NATO (perhaps a feature, for elements of Trump’s administration). Senate Republicans, by Senate Republican standards, have also been forceful in their rejection of the idea. One possible defense of what Trump’s doing, though, is making threats as a means of getting Denmark to put Greenland up for sale. Can we observe, before the savvy negotiator spin takes hold, that purchasing Greenland would also be absurd? It could cost in the trillions at a time when the federal budget is calamitous, higher interest rates and inflation have returned, and there are better things—really, anything else—to spend trillions of dollars on. There are real national security interests and economic interests involved in Greenland. The way to manage that is not to conquer the island but to reach an agreement with Denmark, which was our friend up until about 10 minutes ago.\n\nEverything was so nice and easy a year ago.\n\nThe Minnesota governor used to have a nice life. He put a solid 12 years into the House of Representatives then cruised to a comfy couple of terms as governor. Then, in 2024, he had to have the dotty idea to throw himself into contention for the vice presidency. Not good! It’s not just that he’ll forever be associated with a catastrophic presidential race for Democrats. It’s that the scrutiny returned home with him when he returned to Minnesota.\n\nWalz withdrew his bid for a third gubernatorial campaign this week amid various social services fraud scandals in the state that have drawn national media attention and a federal probe from the Trump administration. (Fortunately for Minnesota Democrats nervous about scandals engulfing the party in the midterms, Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who always puts up strong margins in statewide races, may swoop into the governor’s race.) That decision hardly allows Walz to slink away from the spotlight, though, as now Minnesota is embroiled in an escalating standoff with the administration over ICE. His peace and quiet are another long year away.\n\nLindsey Graham and Rand Paul\n\nA new phase in a lasting Senate rivalry.\n\nAs the Surge wrote in a separate piece this week, the long-standing battle between interventionist Sen. Lindsey Graham and isolationist Sen. Rand Paul for Trump’s heart and mind took a dramatic turn in Graham’s favor when Trump sent the military into Venezuela to abduct its leader. Graham was waltzing around the Capitol with a grin on his face all week as if he had won the 250-year chess match of American politics once and for all. He even went out of his way to neener-neener Rand Paul, who was rather upset by the president’s interventionist turn, on social media.\n\nPaul did have one move up his sleeve, though. He, along with Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, forced a vote on a war powers resolution that would block the president from further military action in Venezuela barring congressional approval. The measure, somewhat surprisingly, advanced on a procedural vote on Thursday as five Republicans joined all Democrats in supporting it. This infuriated Trump, who said that those five Republicans “should never be elected to office again.” Graham, meanwhile, said that he would try to convene a meeting of the Senate GOP “regarding Democrats’ efforts to restrict President Trump’s authority as Commander in Chief under the War Powers Act” concerning “the constitutional effect of the War Powers Act and the damage it will do to our national security.” Graham has had just about enough of Congress, the Article I branch of government to which Graham belongs, having a say in foreign policy.\n\nAn in-kind donation to his presidential aspirations.\n\nLast year, Sen. Mark Kelly joined a handful of other Democrats in Congress in a video telling members of the military that they can refuse illegal orders. The administration took that personally. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth threatened Kelly’s retirement rank and pension for having the … the … the nerve to suggest that anyone could refuse to obey his illegal orders, calling it “seditious.” Earlier this week, then, Hegseth followed up and posted that the department had, in fact, “initiated retirement grade determination proceedings.” Most delightful, though, was his “letter of censure” to Kelly listing a bevy of offenses (various criticisms of the Trump administration) that disgraced the military. The censure letter, bless its heart, includes the line, “I hereby formally CENSURE you.” It’s a light and airy read.\n\nThe letter is more than a window into the Trump administration’s deep and dangerous insecurities. Mark Kelly was nearly selected to be Kamala Harris’ running mate in the 2024 election and, having dodged that bullet, must maintain some presidential ambitions. His flaw has always been that he’s a bit dry, though. So what better way to elevate his profile and spice up his credentials ahead of a Democratic presidential primary than a letter of censure (CENSURE) from the try-hard fitness instructor running the Pentagon?\n\nMaría Corina Machado\n\nDon’t forget to bring the medal to the White House.\n\nWith Nick Maduro sitting in the clink in Brooklyn, who’s going to run Venezuela? (Under the watchful eye of Secretary of State Marco Rubio, of course). The administration’s plan, at least for now, is to leave the existing Chavista regime in place under Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, so long as she does everything the United States wants. When Trump was asked early in the weak why he wouldn’t push to install the opposition leader, María Corina Machado, instead, he said that while “she’s a very nice woman,” she “doesn’t have the support within, or the respect within, the country.”\n\nThe administration’s overriding interest is in restructuring Venezuela as a colony, not making it a democracy, and the CIA determined that replacing the existing regime right now would be more trouble than it’s worth. But it didn’t break Trump’s heart to deny Machado control of the country. Machado won the Nobel Peace Prize last year after Trump had campaigned for it. The Washington Post, citing sources close to Trump, reported that this effectively killed her chances of running Venezuela after Maduro’s ouster. “If she had turned it down and said, ‘I can’t accept it because it’s Donald Trump’s,’ ” one source said, “she’d be the president of Venezuela today.” Trump and Machado are nevertheless expected to meet soon, and Machado has said she would be willing to present her prize to Trump to express her gratitude. Trump liked the sound of that and said it would be a “great honor” to accept it. The world could not be more odd right now.\n\nIt’s the Senate’s turn on ACA subsidies.\n\nOn Thursday, 17 House Republicans joined all Democrats to extend expired Affordable Care Act subsidies for another three years. This vote was made possible through use of a discharge petition, through which a majority of members can force a vote on a bill against House leadership’s wishes, and allows vulnerable Republican members to at least say that they tried. And while this particular bill is dead on arrival in the Senate, it does put pressure on Senate Republicans to address rising premiums in some way—or absorb the political blowback from failing to.\n\nSo what is Senate Majority Leader John Thune to do? The Senate has convened bipartisan working group trying to develop an extension that tightens subsidy eligibility. One of the stickiest points, as ever with ACA subsidies, is abortion. Republicans want more stringent Hyde Amendment protections in ACA plans to ensure that federal dollars would never even consider comingling with payments for abortion services. How does this get resolved? Perhaps with some browbeating from Trump. “You have to be a little flexible on Hyde, you know that,” Trump told House Republicans at a gathering this week. We’re not sure they know that at all.","summary":"Your own eyes tell you what happened in Minneapolis, but this administration can’t live with you believing your own eyes.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/01/ice-minneapolis-shooting-stephen-miller-venezuela.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/fcc49272-9b60-4b1f-8a45-076bffa4eac7.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1041%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 10:45:00","author":"Jim Newell","authors":["Jim Newell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.221},{"id":392321354,"title":"Manasseh Azure Awuni: Where and how Ken Ofori-Atta was arrested","text":"On the morning of January 6, 2026, Ghana’s former finance minister, Ken Ofori-Atta, was arrested in Washington, D.C., by agents of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) of the United States.\n\nThe operation to arrest him, according to sources, appeared targeted, unlike the ongoing raids and swoops at factories and public places where mass arrests by ICE are conducted.\n\nKen Ofori-Atta was emerging from a magnificent luxury apartment building, where he had been living in the U.S., when (ICE) agents surrounded him, led him into a vehicle, and drove him away to a detention facility 89 miles away.\n\nHe was driven to the Caroline Detention Facility in Virginia, about an hour and a half drive from where he was arrested.\n\nMr Ofori-Atta was arrested at the entrance of the Westlight apartment complex in Washington, D.C.

Annual general fund spending surged from $25 billion in 2022 to over $35 billion by 2024. The state has managed to balance spending and revenues for now, thanks to a one-time federal cash infusion, but it is looking at multibillion-dollar deficits every year in the future. Walz did not just spend more; he locked the state into permanently higher obligations without a sustainable revenue base to support them.\n\nYet for all that spending, Minnesotans saw little improvement where it mattered.\n\nTake education, for example. Minnesota ranked well above average in per-pupil spending before Walz’s trifecta. Then he and Democratic lawmakers shoveled billions of dollars more into K-12 education, universal school meals, and expanded administrative mandates. The results were dismal. Test scores continued to lag pre-pandemic levels, achievement gaps widened, and Minneapolis Public Schools continued to struggle despite repeated infusions of cash. More money did not buy better outcomes, just more bureaucracy and mandates, and less accountability.\n\nHealthcare followed the same pattern. Walz expanded public coverage, opened taxpayer-funded programs to illegal immigrants, and poured state dollars into health systems already struggling with cost inflation and workforce shortages. The result was not improved access or lower costs, but mounting fiscal stress. Hospitals across the state closed, services were cut, and there were staffing shortages. Faced with unsustainable spending, Walz was forced to cut back his illegal immigrant healthcare plan, limiting it to minors. Illegal immigrants over 18 years old no longer qualify for the program. Fraud proliferated in the public programs Walz touted as moral examples, exposing how little oversight accompanied the rapid expansion of government spending.\n\nEnergy policy may be the clearest example of ideological zeal overwhelming common sense. Walz signed laws mandating a carbon-free electricity grid, effectively banning fossil fuels by 2040, even as Minnesota, currently under a blanket of snow, remains heavily dependent on them for reliable power. Predictably, energy prices rose. Utility companies warned of higher rates, grid instability, and long-term affordability problems, warnings the Walz administration brushed aside. Energy became more expensive just as inflation was squeezing household budgets.\n\nRising costs were compounded by higher taxes. Minnesota already had one of the highest tax burdens in the country. Under Walz, lawmakers raised taxes again, expanded payroll levies, and created new fees to fund progressive priorities. Businesses noticed, and so did the public. Minnesota lost population to lower-tax, lower-cost states. Employers expanded elsewhere. Young families followed opportunity out the door.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris chose Walz as her running mate, not because he was moderate — he was not — but because his status as an old white man was meant to give a veneer of moderation to the Democratic Party’s far-left agenda. That agenda of massive spending increases failed to deliver better schools, better healthcare, or a more affordable cost of living. Instead, Minnesotans were left with higher taxes, higher energy bills, worsening fiscal outlooks, and a growing sense that their state government and state governor had lost touch with reality.\n\nFraud scandals finally ended Walz’s career, but the more serious damage was already done by the failure of his progressive agenda long before the headlines broke.","summary":"Gov.&#160;Tim Walz&#160;(D-MN) ended his political career on Monday, announcing that he would abandon his reelection campaign in light of the&#160;fraud scandals&#160;involving his state’s nutrition,&#160;healthcare, and&#160;child care&#160;programs.

The statement counts off 57 times the Democrats made “sick, unhinged“ comments and criticized lawmakers for their rhetoric. Newsweek reached out to the White House for comment via email on Friday evening. Why It Matters The statement follows two shootings involving ICE agents this week: The first, on Wednesday in Minneapolis, was deadly, ending the life of Renee Nicole Good and drawing national scrutiny as well as condemnation from Democrats. The second, on Thursday in Portland, Oregon, wounded two people later alleged by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) as associates of the Tren de Aragua gang. Good's death has stirred up division along party lines, with the White House and Republicans defending ICE agent Jonathan Ross while Democrats have criticized the agency and call for his prosecution. Both sides remained deeply entrenched in their stances, even after video footage from the perspective of the ICE agent was released to news media. Vice President JD Vance took an especially strong stance on the death and reporting around it, calling those who accused Ross of murder “radicals,“ while saying that Good's death was “a tragedy of her own making.“ President Donald Trump previously called for an end to divisive rhetoric in the wake of Charlie Kirk's assassination. Concerned citizens gather in front of the Minnesota State Capitol in Saint Paul during a demonstration Friday over the fatal shooting of Renee Nicole Good by a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent. (Photo by Charly Triballeau/AFP via Getty Images) What To Know The statement, posted on the White House website, is titled “57 Times Sick, Unhinged Democrats Declared War on Law Enforcement“ and lists each instance, with links to social media posts or interviews with media and names the person who made each comment. The White House praised ICE and its mission to “valiantly“ defend “our sovereignty and communities,“ linking the post to National Law Enforcement Appreciation Day. The list labels the comments as “smears,“ variously saying the Democrats “accused“ and “attacked“ ICE agents with their words, adding, “unhinged Radical Left Democrats have escalated their torrent of vicious, inflammatory attacks on these very heroes — branding them as Nazis, terrorists, and Gestapo thugs while inciting their delusional supporters to unleash violence.“ The list includes comments from U.S. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortes of New York; Rashida Tlaib of Michigan; Summer Lee of Pennsylvania; and Joaquin Castro of Texas, as well as Mayors Brandon Johnson of Chicago; Zohran Mamdani of New York City; Michelle Wu of Boston; and Karen Bass of Los Angeles. Most notable, the list is topped with comments from Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—a recent and frequent target of ire for Republicans and the Trump administration—and California Governor Gavin Newsom, who leads in polling for the Democratic presidential nominee in 2028, often in close contention with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The White House ended its post with a picture of the phrase, “I STAND WITH ICE,“ echoing a refrain shared on Thursday by the White House on social media. What People Are Saying Conservative radio show host and author Howie Carr, on X: “Check this out from the White House. Do these statements constitute an “insurrection?“ Did any of the comrades mention protesting “peacefully and patriotically?“ Trump, on Truth Social: “The woman driving the car was very disorderly, obstructing and resisting, who then violently, willfully, and viciously ran over the ICE Officer, who seems to have shot her in self-defense. Based on the attached clip, it is hard to believe he is alive, but is now recovering in the hospital. The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis.

The lawsuit was filed Thursday by Illinois and the four other states.\n\nThe Trump administration announced earlier this week that Illinois, Minnesota, New York, California and Colorado would be cut off from $7 billion in funding for the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which provides cash assistance for households with children, nearly $2.4 billion for the Child Care and Development Fund, which helps support working parents with child care and around $870 million for social services grants that help children at risk.\n\nIt came a week after the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said it was freezing child care funds in Minnesota and asking for an audit of day care centers amid allegations of fraud by day care centers run by Somali residents.\n\n“I’m pleased with the court’s decision, which protects critical funding to support families and help working parents access child care,” Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul said in a statement. “There is no justification for this attempted funding freeze. It is a cruel and illegal attempt by the Trump administration to play politics with the lives of children and low-income families. I remain committed to protecting Illinois residents from bearing the brunt of this president’s continued disregard for our Constitution and the rule of law.”\n\nA spokesperson for HHS didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nIllinois was set to cut off from $1 billion in funding across the three programs, according to the state’s Department of Human Services, which administers the funds. That would have amounted to around 150,000 children being impacted by the funding freeze.\n\nA spokesperson for IDHS said the agency does not anticipate an immediate impact to funding as a result of the judge’s order.\n\nWhen announcing the freeze, HHS Assistant Secretary Alex Adams said the federal government is concerned by potential “systemic fraud in Illinois Child Care and Development Fund services.” He claimed the Trump administration “has reason to believe” the state is “illicitly providing” CCDF benefits to people without legal status in the U.S.\n\nIn their lawsuit, Raoul and the other attorneys general called the fraud allegations, “pretextual, vague, and unsubstantiated.”\n\nAt a news conference earlier Friday, before the judge’s ruling, U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin blasted the Trump administration’s decision to freeze the funds, warning that children in the targeted states will “pay the price.”\n\nDurbin claimed that the funds, which helps families afford child care, were slashed because Trump received fewer votes in Illinois than former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\n“We should not penalize these children for political reasons,” said Durbin at Concordia Place in Avondale, a child care provider that relies on federal funds to operate. Representatives for the Illinois Action for Children joined Durbin at the event.","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/news/2026/01/09/judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-administration-from-freezing-child-care-funding-in-illinois-4-other-states","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/6f16335/2147483647/strip/false/crop/6122x4083+0+0/resize/1486x991!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Ff9%2F10%2F5ac87870cbd4e4ff97e8dc683a65%2Fmerli","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-10 00:21:51","author":"Elleiana Green,Kade Heather","authors":["Elleiana Green","Kade Heather"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.317},{"id":392171796,"title":"Judge blocks Trump from freezing $10 billion in child, family aid to five US states","text":"NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Friday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's administration from freezing access by five Democratic-led states to more than $10 billion of federal funds for childcare and family assistance based on what it said were concerns about fraud.

Trump Talk WH Meet-up on Venezuela, 'Long-Term' Effect on Prices","text":"On Friday, President Trump hosted representatives of some of the world's largest oil companies at the White House. The president's only complaint seemed to be that the new ballroom wasn't yet complete, because, as he claimed, they could have filled it.\n\nPresident Trump announced the meeting on Truth Social.\n\nThe president wrote:\n\nThe largest Oil Companies in the World are coming to the White House at 2:30 P.M. Everybody wants to be there. It’s too bad that the Ballroom hasn’t completed because, if it were, it would be PACKED. We apologize to those Oil Companies that we cannot take today, but Secretary of Energy Chris Wright, and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum, will see them over the next week. Everyone is in daily contact. Today’s meeting will almost exclusively be a discussion on Venezuelan Oil, and our longterm relationship with Venezuela, its Security, and People. A very big factor in this involvement will be the reduction of Oil Prices for the American People. Additionally, and perhaps most importantly of all, will be the stoppage of Drugs and Criminals coming into the United States of America. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\n\nA reduction in oil prices would be good - up to a point, of course; if prices drop too far, it can make production in some areas not economically viable. That is, though, often a problem that fixes itself in time. \n\nRead More: Pre-Dawn Blitz: Navy, Marines Seize Another Tramp Oil Hauler\n\nIt's the response from the US Oil & Gas Association, though, that's really interesting.\n\nIt's a long post, but here are a few highlights.\n\nHere is our afternoon take on this WH meeting. There are 2 \"Must haves\" for producers to go back into Venezuela. 1 - We need know our crews are not going to get kidnapped. 2- We need to know investment and capital expenditures are going to be safe from seizure by a foreign government. The overwhelming show of force from the US military on last Saturday morning – well, that solves the first problem. \n\nIndeed, it does - as long as President Trump is in office. Anything past that depends on who wins the presidential election in 2028; if, in January, 2029, sees, say, a President JD Vance and Vice President Marco Rubio inaugurated (just to name a couple of possibilities) then that assurance will last. If a Democrat should win... Well, if that happened, were I an oil company executive, I'd probably be giving some serious thought to divesting of any assets in Venezuela, and getting my people out.\n\nRE: #2 -- I expect that the Administration will put a very interesting set of financing options on the table for US producers that will link Venezuelan investment not to a company’s CapEx budgets – but to the US government’s international project financing mechanisms such as the ExIm bank or other entities designed to reduce exposure to US interests and investments overseas. Its’s one thing to have a foreign government seize a company’s asset – but seizing an asset that is financed and back by the US government? Try it and you gonna get another visit in the middle of the night by representatives of the US military.\n\nThe same thing as above applies. Not only the midterms but the 2028 elections. We have to keep control, or all this comes flying apart. We have to win these elections, or all this is for naught. Republicans, strangely, have a bad habit of underperforming on midterms; that has to stop. We have to turn out, we have to win, or all this stops. It sounds tiresome, sometimes, to keep proclaiming every upcoming election as \"OMG most important election ever,\" but we are at a critical juncture. We have to keep this momentum up, and the nation can't afford four years of a President Gavin Newsom - or Kamala Harris. \n\nBack to the US Oil & Gas Association, they make one great, final point:\n\nThis is the Art of the Deal and there’s no one better than the guy who wrote the book.\n\nThat right there, that is a natural-born fact. We just need to make sure that deal stays in place.\n\nEditor’s Note: The Democrat Party has never been less popular as voters reject its globalist agenda.\n\nHelp us continue exposing Democrats' plans to lead America down a dangerous path.

The first one was a graphic calling ICE a “federally funded and supported terrorist group,” with the original creator describing the agency’s actions as “tearing apart families, terrorizing citizens, and now murdering innocent people.”\n\nBillie Eilish Pushes for Gun Control Amid ‘Devastating’ Shootings in U.S. & Australia: ‘Raise Your Voice’\n\nJohn Mulaney Postpones Minneapolis Shows Following ICE Killing of Renee Nicole Good: ‘What’s Happening in Your City Is Heartbreaking’\n\nBillie Eilish Condemns Israel Defense Minister’s Plan to Forcibly Relocate Palestinians: ‘Horrifying’\n\nThe second post Eilish reshared on her Story calls on the country to “abolish ICE,” listing 32 people who reportedly died in ICE custody last year. The third encourages U.S. citizens to call their representatives in Congress to demand that ICE be defunded, and for the officer who fired the deadly shot in Minneapolis to be arrested and charged immediately.\n\nBillboard has reached out to the White House and the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\nICE’s actions under the Donald Trump administration have been polarizing since he took office a year ago, but backlash has reached an all-time high this week following the scene in Minneapolis. The DHS, the president and Vice President JD Vance have all claimed that Good was trying to run over the agents with her car leading up to the shooting, and that the officer in question was acting in self defense; however, widely circulated video footage of the incident shows that Good had actually been driving the opposite way.\n\nEven Trump struggled to explain what happened after he personally watched the video of the shooting in the Oval Office with a New York Times reporter also in the room. “Well … I … the way I look at it … it’s a terrible scene,” the newspaper reports of the twice-impeached POTUS’ reaction to the footage. “I think it’s horrible to watch. No, I hate to see it.”\n\nEilish has long been vocal in her opposition to Trump’s policies, endorsing his opponent, Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election.

And so much of that runs through halls like this one.”\n\nBefore Shapiro took to the stage, one of the people who stepped up ahead of him was a man who goes by “Tim O”, a 52-year-old father who is on his second career and his second year in a carpentry apprenticeship. Tim became choked up when he said, “I don’t look like other apprentices.”\n\nShapiro said Tim was an example of his administration’s investment in trade programs in a state where over 60% of the population did not attend college and that it was important to give him a platform.\n\n“One of the things I always ask the apprentices is, ‘Hey, how’d you get here? What brought you here? What was your journey?’ Some of them come right out of high school, and we want to create those pathways,” Shapiro explained of the variety of answers he has received over the years. “Some of them go to college for a year, realize it’s not for them. Some of them have different careers and then find their ways here.”\n\n“The key is opening up the doors to places like this and showing people it exists because we need people like Tim O., who, even at 52 to dedicate their lives to having the skills we need to produce more energy, to quite literally build bridges and build buildings,” Shapiro said.\n\nThe speech was filled with stories highlighting accomplishments, future goals, and governing with purpose, and included a brief swipe at the bipartisan chaos in Washington. Notably, Shapiro avoided inflammatory language, steering clear of demonizing Republicans or President Donald Trump.\n\nAnd he uses the word “we” instead of “I” when discussing accomplishments, something many politicians cannot find a way to do.\n\n“I obviously have profound differences from the president. You have written about that,” he said. “No one expects us to agree on everything. But to me, vilifying others, attacking others, is not a way to bring people together and get stuff done.”\n\nShapiro, who has a good relationship with Sen. Dave McCormick (R-PA), said his job is to champion the things people can do together for the commonwealth.\n\n“My focus is on building bridges, creating more opportunity for folks to come together, and delivering results for people like Tim O. and others who need help,” he said. “And so, to me, I want this campaign to be hopeful. I want to highlight differences where we have different policy views, but I want to focus on uplifting people.”\n\nLarry Ceisler, a Washington County native and Philadelphia-based public affairs official, said the reason you do not see Shapiro go personal on Trump is that, first of all, that is always who he has been and, second, because he always wants his governance to be about purpose, not divisiveness.\n\n“He always tries to make it substantive and not personal because he never wants to be perceived as attacking the people who support the president, so when he does criticize, it is based on the issues,” Ceisler said.\n\nShapiro begins his launch with a formidable amount of cash. This week, his campaign announced he ended 2025 with over $30 million in cash on hand and a Quinnipiac University poll that showed Shapiro’s favorability rating at 58%.\n\nHe faces Republican Stacy Garrity, the state treasurer, who has won back-to-back races for that statewide elected office. Garrity said in a statement that “Josh Shapiro is more concerned with a promotion to Pennsylvania Avenue than serving hardworking Pennsylvanians.”\n\nShapiro’s governorship entered the national spotlight early, shaped by crisis decisions beginning in 2023, shortly after he took office, with the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, near the Pennsylvania border. The fiery wreck, visible for miles, was followed by a controlled burn that raised concerns across Beaver and Lawrence counties over toxic contamination in the air and water.\n\nThat was followed in June 2023 by a tanker truck crash beneath Interstate 95 in Philadelphia, a vital East Coast artery carrying more than 150,000 vehicles a day. The crash killed the driver and caused the overpass to collapse. Despite predictions that the highway could be closed for years, six temporary lanes reopened within two weeks, allowing traffic to move while permanent repairs were made.\n\nShapiro was also governor in July 2024 when gunman Thomas Crooks attempted to assassinate Trump, killing local fire chief Cory Comperatore and wounding two others. Shapiro was on the scene in Butler the following morning with first responders and investigators. He was in office as well when Luigi Mangione was arrested in Altoona for the alleged killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, and when three police officers were murdered in York County in the deadliest day for Pennsylvania law enforcement in 16 years.\n\nDuring that period, Shapiro was also on the short list of possible running mates for 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, before ultimately determining the role was not the right fit.\n\nLast year, an arsonist attempted to kill Shapiro and his family by firebombing the governor’s residence, setting the home ablaze, and causing extensive damage. Shapiro, his wife, their children, and other family members narrowly escaped the rapidly spreading flames.\n\nShapiro has said the attack prompted serious conversations with his wife about whether he should seek reelection.\n\n“I think a couple of days after that, my primary focus was on being a good dad and a good husband and being a good governor. And I have tried very, very hard to both heal myself and be there for my kids as they work through this and be there for Laurie,” he said of his wife, who was with him at the beginning of the interview.\n\nShapiro admits there were many family discussions on what they should do.\n\n“We had a long talk about whether we wanted to keep doing this in the face of that kind of attack and that kind of threat,” he said. “The reality is we all ended up in the exact same place. Yes, we not only have to keep governing, but we’ve got to run again and keep doing this because you can’t let those who want to inflict pain on others bring harm to communities. You can’t let them win.”\n\nShapiro said he expects to continue working through the aftermath for years, noting that members of both parties privately reached out to check on his well-being and offer help, including Trump, who was himself the target of an assassination attempt.\n\n“He called, and I appreciated that,” he said. “And we talked about his brush with death in public. No public officials should have to go through this. Our politics shouldn’t be this way.”\n\nShapiro said he hopes the way he runs his campaign and governs will help lower the temperature and allow for a measure of healing.\n\n“I said today in my speech, go talk to that person that voted a different way in the last election and have a respectful conversation,” Shapiro said. “We need more of that.”","summary":"COLLIER TOWNSHIP, Pennsylvania — Gov.
