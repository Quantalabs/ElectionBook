{"offset":0,"number":50,"available":5585,"news":[{"id":253539566,"title":"With Walz beside her, Harris says strengthened middle class to be 'defining goal'","text":"Aug. 6 (UPI) -- Appearing with her vice presidential running mate for the first time in the campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed her first political rally as the official Democratic Party nominee for president Tuesday at Temple University in Philadelphia. \"Delegates to the Democratic Party national convention finished voting last night,\" Harris told the receptive audience. \"I am now officially the Democratic Party nominee for president of the United States.\" The enthusiastic crowd cheered loudly upon learning of Harris's new status as the party's nominee as her newly announced running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, stood at her side. Later during the event, he blasted former President Donald Trump, saying the GOP nominee for president \"sows chaos and division.\" Before Walz spoke for the first time as Harris' Democratic vice president running mate, though, the current vice president laid out the stakes ahead for her campaign for the White House. \"Now, we have some work to do,\" Harris said. \"We are the underdogs in this race, but we have the momentum and I know exactly what we are up against.\" In what has become a common refrain on her recent campaign stops, Harris referenced her prior positions as a prosecutor, district attorney and attorney general for California and the types of criminals she prosecuted. \"I know Donald Trump's type,\" she said to loud applause. Harris said her campaign is a \"fight for the future\" and said she will work to ensure affordable housing, affordable health care, affordable child care and paid leave. \"Strengthening the middle class will be my defining goal,\" Harris announced. \"Ours is a fight for the middle class and a fight for freedom.\" She promised to \"bring down prices that are still too high and lower the cost of living for America's families. Freedoms and the threat of Trump When it comes to the aspect of freedom in her campaign, Harris said, they include the \"freedom to vote, be safe from gun violence, love who you love openly and with pride, and the freedom of a woman to make decisions for her own body and not have a government tell her what to do.\" \"If Donald Trump gets a chance, he will end the Affordable Care Act and take us back to a time when insurance companies could deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions,\" she said. \"Gov. Walz and I will not let that happen.\" \"Health care should be a right and not just a privilege for those who can afford it,\" she said. If Democrats win majorities in the House and Senate, Harris said she will make sure Congress passes a bill to restore reproductive freedom and sign it into law. She said Congress also would pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act, expand background checks for firearms purchases and increase penalties for illegal gun sales. Harris also promised to ban military-style rifles commonly referred to as \"assault weapons.\" Harris introduces her new running mate She then spent much of her remaining time introducing Walz, whom she announced as her running mate earlier in the day and likened to the \"varsity team\" and referred to Trump's running mate Sen. JD Vance of Ohio as the \"JV squad.\" \"We each face a question,\" Harris told the crowd. \"What kind of country do we want to live in?\" The options are a \"country of freedom, compassion and the rule of law or a country of chaos, fear and hate,\" she said. \"We each have the power to answer that question,\" Harris said. \"The power is with the people.\" \"We are running on behalf of all Americans and when elected will govern on behalf of all Americans,\" she said. Harris then turned the mic over to Walz, who told the audience about how he was raised on a family farm in a small town in Nebraska, joined the National Guard and attended college on the GI Bill. He recounted his years as a teacher and assistant football coach and his \"commitment for the common good.\" Walz said Trump \"doesn't know the first thing about service\" because he's \"too busy serving himself\" and \"sows chaos and division.\" \"He froze in the face of the COVID crisis,\" Walz said of Trump, and said Republicans want the government to be free to \"invade your doctor's office.\" Walz said he \"can't wait\" to debate Vance and claimed Trump and Vance are \"creepy\" and \"weird as hell.\" Trump and Vance have a \"dangerous and backward\" vision for the nation, Walz said. \"We aren't going back!\" The crowd then chanted \"We're not going back\" several times, which has become a campaign slogan for Harris and Walz.","summary":"Appearing with her vice presidential running mate for the first time in the campaign, Vice President Kamala Harris addressed her first rally as the official Democratic Party nominee for president Tuesday in Philadelphia.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/08/06/harris-walz-pennsylvania-rally-first-time-together/6181722987846/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/6181722987846/2024/upi/2fde1cacebaeb51d1c29107637062ec2/v1.2/With-Walz-beside-her-Harris-says-strengthened-middle-class-to-be-defining-goal.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 00:41:40","author":"Mike Heuer","authors":["Mike Heuer"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.022},{"id":253539538,"title":"Harris taps Gov. Tim Walz to join ticket after he labels Republicans ‘weird’","text":"After what must have been one of the shortest running-mate vetting processes in U.S. history, Vice President Kamala Harris announced Tuesday she that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz would join her on the Democratic ticket. The announcement came just 16 days after Harris took the party reins from President Joe Biden, after the latter chose to step aside from electoral consideration in favor of his vice president. “When I called (Walz) this morning to ask him to join our campaign, I shared my deep level of respect for him and the work we’ve done together. We’re going to unify this country and we’re going to win. Let’s go get this done,” Harris said via social media. “He really does shine a light on a better future that we can build together,” Harris said at an evening rally in Philadelphia. “Tim Walz will be ready on day one.” Walz said that it’s the “honor of a lifetime” to join the campaign. “I’m all in. Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what’s possible. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school. So, let’s get this done, folks,” he wrote. “I couldn’t be prouder to be on this ticket,” he said later in Philadelphia. Walz, 60, joined the U.S. Army National Guard at 17 years old and retired after serving 24 years as an artillery officer and rising to the rank of Command Sergeant Major. He’s a former high school social studies teacher and football coach who took his team to their first state championship. Raised in Nebraska by a military family, Walz entered politics after moving to his wife Gwen’s native Minnesota in the 90s. He used his folksy charm and natural ability to connect with regular people to run for and win the North Star State’s conservative-leaning First Congressional District in 2006, and went on to win reelection five times. He won the governor’s office in 2018 and was reelected to that position in 2022. The governor, a father of two, has never lost an election. Walz is also seen as the first to come up with an insult capable of sticking to the famously Teflon-coated Donald Trump, labeling the 45th President and his running mate “weird.” During his time in office, according to the Harris-Walz campaign, Walz “lowered the cost of insulin to $35 per month for many Minnesotans. He eliminated junk fees. And, he signed paid leave into law so that parents can take care of sick family without losing their job.” “Governor Walz stood up for fundamental freedoms and made Minnesota the first state to pass a law codifying abortion rights after the Supreme Court overturned Roe. He funded Minnesota police departments, putting more cops on the street and investing in body cameras, and established universal background checks for gun purchases. And, he worked across the aisle to pass a bipartisan infrastructure package,” the campaign wrote. Walz is also a gun owner and “avid pheasant hunter” that’s pro-Second Amendment but in favor of legislation to tackle gun violence. According to Bay State Gov. Maura Healey, Harris has made a fantastic choice in Walz, and the pair make the “ideal team to defeat Donald Trump and JD Vance and move this country forward.” “I’m a proud colleague of Governor Walz,” she said, noting his military and teaching service. “He is a person of deep integrity and empathy.” House Minority Whip Katherine Clark said Walz “is a joyful, battle-tested public servant who has made it his life’s work to help others — from the National Guard to the classroom to the governor’s mansion.” “While Donald Trump and JD Vance work to rig our economy for the rich and tear away women’s rights, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz have a vision for our country that includes everyone. They will lead with compassion, safeguard our freedom, and ensure working families can get ahead,” she said in a statement. UMass Lowell Professor John Cluverius, an expert in presidential politics, said that Walz is just bland enough to be a good choice for Harris. “In a vice president, you want to pick someone as unifying and boring as possible. It’s smart for Harris to pick someone who isn’t going to offend and Walz is brilliantly dull,” he said. Trump responded to Harris’ announcement that Walz would join her campaign by seemingly inventing a movement to reestablish Biden’s candidacy, despite the fact that Harris officially clinched the party nomination Monday night. “This is the most Radical Left duo in American history. There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again. Crazy Kamabla is, indeed, CRAZY. I HEAR THERE IS A BIG MOVEMENT TO ‘BRING BACK CROOKED JOE,’” he wrote, capitalization and misspelling his. Walz has received criticism from some Republicans over his leadership during protests and riots that occurred in his state in 2020, following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer, and for his use of executive power during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Walz was arrested in 1995 and accused of driving under the influence. He later pled guilty to a reduced charge of reckless driving. A spokesperson for the Republican National Committee said the Command Sgt. Maj. is “weak, failed, and dangerously liberal” and that he “transformed Minnesota into a third-world refuge for the Radical Left’s most deranged lunacy — and now he’s joining forces with Kamala to do it to the rest of the country.”","summary":"Walz said that it’s the “honor of a lifetime\" to join the campaign.","url":"https://www.bostonherald.com/2024/08/06/harris-taps-gov-tim-walz-to-join-ticket-after-he-labels-republicans-weird/","image":"https://www.bostonherald.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165602399.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 00:38:58","author":"Matthew Medsger","authors":["Matthew Medsger"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.208},{"id":253539274,"title":"US Election: Why Kamala Harris Picked Tim Walz As Running Mate","text":"US Vice President Kamala Harris, who officially became the Democratic Presidential Nominee yesterday, has picked Minnesota Governor and former high school teacher Tim Walz as her running mate ahead of the November 5 Presidential election. Analysts in the US believe that Harris and Walz’s combination is good enough to upstage Republican candidate Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance. Still, many Republicans believe Walz is a weak pick. Several Republican lawmakers and leaders describe Walz as a “far-left” governor. Walz was probably selected for being plainspoken, and his stature in a Midwestern town could appeal to independent and conservative voters. Walz came to the national limelight when he called Trump and JD Vance “weird,” a phrase Harris has often copied when talking about her primary opponent. Walz will be officially unveiled as Harris’s running mate at a rally in Philadelphia, and then they will tour key battleground states. Democratic National Convention had announced that 99% of Democratic delegates officially crowned Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party presidential nominee after a five-day online ballot. Before this, however, she had secured the 1,976 delegate votes she needed to become the Democratic Party Nominee within 32 hours of President Joe Biden’s withdrawal. However, the party had to wait to conclude the process, stipulating that an online vote must be completed to make it official. Analysts said that one of the main reasons Tim Walz was chosen is his ability to woo white, working-class Americans. This key demographic has helped fuel and maintain Donald Trump’s political fortunes in this country. A former school teacher, football coach and long-time member of the Army National Guard, Walz started running for office in his 40s. In his first race, he successfully ran against a Republican in Minnesota’s rural, traditionally conservative 1st Congressional District. He was re-elected five times before he left Capitol Hill. While Republicans are already attacking him as “too liberal”, some of the policies he implemented as Minnesota’s governor proved broadly popular among the state’s Democrats and Republicans. In 2023, Walz signed an executive order removing the college degree requirement for 75% of Minnesota’s state jobs. Several other states later copied the initiative. Walz is also said to be a gun owner and hunter, although his support among gun rights groups slipped after he backed tighter restrictions on firearms ownership. However, in his characteristic manner, the Trump-Vance campaign team has issued a statement in which they condemned Walz, calling him a “dangerously liberal extremist” who was put on the Democratic ticket to aid Harris’ progressive agenda. In a video posted on X, the Trump campaign team said Harris “doubled down on her radical vision for America by tapping another left-wing extremist as her nominee”, calling their platform “dangerously liberal”.","summary":"US Vice President Kamala Harris, who officially became the Democratic Presidential Nominee yesterday, has picked Minnesota Governor and former high school teacher Tim Walz as her running mate ahead of the November 5 Presidential election.

Yet vibes are notoriously hard to spot, and they don’t always show up in polls, but as Kamala Harris took to the stage in a cavernous auditorium at Temple University in Philadelphia on Tuesday with her new running mate, they were measurable in the screams and shouts of 12,000 people. The replacement of Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket by Harris has changed the energy in the room. And Harris’s choice of Minnesota governor Tim Walz as her vice presidential candidate is a sign that she is banking on that energy taking her to the White House. It’s a strategy based on the idea that campaigns are not won on fear alone, but on feeling. Where Biden spoke sternly and in hushed tones of Donald Trump and the threat he posed to democracy, Harris and her running mate are here to provoke, mock and laugh at their opponents. Walz set the tone with his first words on stage as the official vice presidential nominee. “Thank you for bringing back the joy,” he said to Harris. Walz is not the most practical pick for the electoral map math — that would have been Josh Shapiro, the popular governor of the must-win Pennsylvania. But he brings a Midwest Dad energy to the ticket that stands in stark contrast to the 4Chan ramblings of JD Vance and the disjointed string of thinly-veiled racism that emanates from Donald Trump. He was able to land dad jokes and piercing attacks on Trump and Vance with ease. One of the biggest cheers of the night — and there were a lot — came when he combined the two. \"Make no mistake, violent crime was up under Donald Trump — and that’s not even counting the crimes he committed,” Walz said. He then turned his attention to his opponent on the vice presidential ticket. \"Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a best seller trashing that community. “Come on. That’s not what Middle America is. And I got to tell you. I can’t wait to debate the guy ... That is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up,\" he added, in an apparent reference to unverified internet rumors that Vance had intimate relations with a sofa. Harris has been basking in this vibe shift since accepting the Democratic nomination. Here in Philadelphia, her stump speech elicited crowd participation — they knew the words; they knew how to respond. “So hear me when I say,” Harris said, with a long pause for the crowd to cheer. “I know Donald Trump’s type.” With the addition of Walz, the Democrats now have two happy warriors on the ticket. It’s a gamble but Republicans are clearly struggling to land an effective response. As the crowd was waiting for Walz and Harris on stage, Trump seemed to be pining for his former opponent. “What are the chances that Crooked Joe Biden, the WORST President in the history of the U.S., whose Presidency was Unconstitutionally STOLEN from him by Kamabla, Barrack HUSSEIN Obama, Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Shifty Adam Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, and others on the Lunatic Left, CRASHES the Democrat National Convention and tries to take back the Nomination, beginning with challenging me to another DEBATE” he wrote on Truth Social. Harris supporters at the event have noticed the difference, too. “I think it’s a renewed energy. The city feels different,” said Bridget McKeogh, a Philadelphia resident, as she waited for the rain to pass outside the event. “I love Biden. I think he’s a great president. But things felt kind of old and there wasn’t really an excitement around it. And that’s completely changed. I see young black people registering people to vote, as well as people that look like me,” she added. Harris will be counting on this new energy to translate into practical advantages — whether that means donations or more volunteer boots on the ground. Some are already seeing it. “Oh, the vibe shift was immediate,” said Marscha Levell. “Within 2 or 3 hours I got a text message from one of my cousins telling me about the Zoom call for black women for Kamala, and they got 44,000 women, and they raised over $1 million in 24 hours. So that was like a major culture shift.” There was a message in the jibes, too. Harris and Walz pitched their ticket not just as joyful versus weird, but as a living representation of what it means to be American. “The promise of America is what makes it possible for two middle-class kids, one a daughter of Oakland, California, who was raised by a working mother, the other a son of the Nebraska planes who grew up working on a farm.. it’s the promise of America, because only in America, only in America, is it possible for them together to make it all the way to the White House,” Harris said.","summary":"The replacement of Joe Biden at the top of the ticket has changed the energy in the room","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-tim-walz-rally-b2592327.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/07/01/Election_2024_Harris_73040.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 00:30:15","author":"Richard Hall","authors":["Richard Hall"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.104},{"id":253539718,"title":"As Harris and Walz campaign in Philly, residents slam economy: It's 'sucking right now'","text":"Ahead of Vice President Harris' rally in Philadelphia with her new running mate, Gov.

The move follows the recent assassination in Iran of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas. The development has raised concerns of an escalation of the conflict in the region where Israel continues its war on the Gaza Strip in response to an attack by Hamas in October 2023. ---------- Harris picks Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate for White House WASHINGTON - U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said Tuesday that she has chosen Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who has a proven record of connecting with rural Americans, to be her running mate for the November presidential election, voicing hope that he can appeal to working-class voters.

Mark Kelly. It was just 16 days ago that President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, and Harris and her vetting team, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, were operating in a truncated time frame. The vetting team initially cast a wide net, with more than a dozen people in consideration. That list quickly got shorter, with nine people being formally asked to submit vetting materials. It's a process that is extensive and one that would typically take months – but Holder, along with his vetting team led by former White House counsel Dana Remus, campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, campaign chief of staff Sheila Nix, and Harris's brother-in-law Tony West – wrapped up their work on Friday, turning it over to Harris for a final decision. Harris met with her vetting team on Saturday and was provided with extensive briefings on each candidate under consideration. She would then interview her top choices. Following Harris's interview with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, there was a sense among Shapiro's team that the meeting did not go as well as it could have, sources familiar with the matter tell ABC News. Later Sunday, after the interview, Shapiro placed a phone call to Harris' team, indicating he had reservations about leaving his job as governor, sources said. Walz, on the other hand, had an indication Monday evening that he would be chosen as Harris' running mate, sources familiar with the matter said. Harris came to her decision on Monday and told a small group of staff, sources said.

There were 822,310 ticketless parking fines handed out by local councils in the last financial year, compared to 551,441 in the twelve months prior. Responding to driver concerns, NSW Finance Minister Courtney Houssos asked councils to revert back to paper parking fines in March, saying the ticketless system \"failed to meet community expectations\". Houssos said since then 30 councils have indicated to Revenue NSW or stated publicly they had either already, or planned to, go back to issuing on-the-spot fines. However, some councils had stated they were unwilling to make changes unless they were forced to by new legislation, Houssos said. Houssos warned the government would be taking further steps to make sure the system was made fairer. \"If councils aren't willing to provide a common-sense fix, the NSW Government will step in and use our policy levers to ensure the ticketless parking fine system meets community expectations,\" Houssos said.

The digital currency, which serves as the native token of the high-performance Solana blockchain, reached as much as $149.61 around 6 p.m. EST, according to Coinbase data provided by TradingView. At this point, the SOL token, which rallied along with many cryptocurrencies, was up roughly 35.8% after falling to nearly $110.00 yesterday morning, additional Coinbase figures from TradingView reveal. Global Markets Bounce Back These digital assets, along with major stock indexes like the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average, bounced back today after experiencing sharp losses over the weekend and early yesterday morning. When explaining these latest movements in Solana’s SOL, as well as other digital currencies and stocks, several analysts stated that markets simply became oversold and then experienced a natural recovery. Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, emphasized that the latest market developments were driven largely by sharp changes in market sentiment.

Brett Sifling, an investment advisor for Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, also spoke to more widespread trends in digital currencies. “I’m not seeing any specific Solana news that is driving the rally. I believe Solana is most likely experiencing a recovery with the broader crypto markets,” he stated via email. Solana’s Bullish Case Regardless of how much volatility the SOL token has experienced lately, it is benefiting from multiple bullish factors, a situation that several analysts pointed out. Pat Doyle, blockchain researcher for digital asset data provider Amberdata, emphasized these variables. “Despite the recent volatility, Solana continues to demonstrate robust fundamentals,” he stated via emailed comments. “Key metrics such as the growth in active users, increased dex volumes, and overall ecosystem expansion reflect the underlying strength of the platform,” Doyle noted. “In comparison to ETH, Solana remains undervalued. Looking at their respective market caps, Solana’s market cap is currently at 22% of Ethereum’s,” he added, citing data recently pulled from CoinGecko. “Given the ongoing growth and adoption within the Solana ecosystem, I anticipate this percentage to increase over time, indicating a potential for significant value appreciation relative to ETH,” Doyle predicted. Seth Ginns, managing partner and head of liquid investments at CoinFund, also spoke to the many bullish factors surrounding the cryptocurrency. “Solana is benefiting from a number of tailwinds. Onchain activity has been strong, and there’s an expectation for new features and upgrades to ship between now and the big Solana developer conference Breakpoint next month,” he stated via email. “It has also graduated into the realm of megacaps that have the confidence of tradfi, so it trades as a lower-risk asset that still has a lot of upside potential as its ecosystem expands,” Ginns added.

He doesn't have time for it, because he's too busy serving himself.\"Harris addressed supporters before Walz took the microphone, and described her vice president pick as a role model for his former students and a governor who stands for freedom.The vice president also made a joke about Walz's background in high school athletics by comparing him to Vance.\"Some might say it's like a matchup between the varsity team and the JV squad,\" Harris quipped.","summary":"Harris announced her pick for vice president Tuesday morning.

Harris named Gov. Tim Walz, a former six-term lawmaker, social studies teacher and American football coach, as her vice presidential pick hours before they made their first joint appearance at a rally in Pennsylvania, the first leg of her five-day tour, amid a tight race against former President Donald Trump. \"I am proud to announce that I've asked @Tim_Walz to be my running mate,\" she wrote on X, formerly Twitter. \"As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he's delivered for working families like his. It's great to have him on the team. Now let's get to work,\" she added. The Midwestern governor said that he is \"all in\" for the campaign. \"It is the honor of a lifetime to join @kamalaharris in this campaign,\" he wrote on X. \"I'm all in. Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what's possible. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school.\" The announcement ended days of grueling considerations over finalists' impact on her campaign and the electoral map, as well as their chemistry with Harris. The finalists included Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. Though other finalists had a stronger competitive edge, like a battleground advantage, Walz is known to be a loyalist to the Biden-Harris administration, with his folksy demeanor, progressive policy records and other records expected to help Harris' campaign. Walz, a plain-spoken politician, got into the spotlight when he described Trump and other Republicans as \"weird\" in recent media appearances. That expression has been popularized in political discourse both online and offline during this election cycle. At the rally in Philadelphia, Harris said that with Walz, she will \"fight for the future.\" \"Our campaign is not just a fight against Donald Trump. Our campaign ... this campaign is a fight for the future.\" Walz was first elected the state's governor in 2018 and won reelection in 2022. He served as a congressman representing Minnesota's first district from 2007 through 2019. He previously served in the Army National Guard and worked as a public school teacher and football coach. During his time as governor, he made a range of achievements, including providing universal free school meals for students, protecting reproductive freedom, cutting taxes for the middle class and expanding paid leave for Minnesota workers, according to his office's website. Trump's campaign criticized Walz as a \"dangerously liberal extremist,\" reports said. Harris' veepstakes had raised concerns about fissures within the party as donors, different wings of the party and others called for their preferred candidates to be on the national ticket at a time when Harris sought unity to rally her party ranks and supporters behind her. In a virtual five-day roll call vote that ended Monday, Harris received 99 percent of delegate votes to officially clinch the Democratic presidential nomination. The vote was arranged ahead of the Democratic National Convention, set for Aug. 19-22, because of Ohio's Aug. 7 deadline for parties to submit the names of their candidates.

Getty Images The Summer Olympic Games in Paris is in full swing, and there is no shortage of inspiring stories and international controversy. The history of the games goes back around 3,000 years—held every four summers in honour of the Greek god Zeus. But modern companies can gain valuable lessons from the competition despite its ancient origins. The Paris Olympics reflects the unique hopes, dreams and challenges of the 206 territories that make up our diverse, imperfect and beautiful world. Getting noticed The Olympic ceremony launched with extravagance and controversy. The ceremony featured performances from Lady Gaga, Celine Dion and a torch-bearing Snoop Dogg. But it was a scene featuring drag queens, a transgender model and a semi-naked blue man that sparked international outrage. Critics viewed the performance as a parody of Leonardo da Vinci’s “Last Supper”. Catholics and other religious groups called the show demeaning, disgusting and disrespectful. The Vatican said it was saddened by the Paris opening ceremony and the Organizing Committee apologised. The contrasting reaction to the opening ceremony highlights growing cultural polarization: accelerated and amplified by social media algorithms. Most marketing goes unnoticed. If your marketing goes unseen, everything else is academic. In the words of Oscar Wilde: “There is only one thing in life worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about.” Brands are drowning in a sea of sameness. For marketing to be effective, it needs to evoke an emotional response. A positive emotion is ideal, but any emotion is better than apathy. Now, that doesn’t mean being controversial for the sake of controversy. Getting noticed can be as simple as making a stand, choosing a common enemy or telling a story. The Beijing (2008) and London (2012) Olympic opening ceremonies are still talked about today because they made people feel something. What would your brand’s opening ceremony look and feel like? Niche Subplots Historically, the Olympics could only be viewed through a handful of official TV broadcasters that secured the licensing rights. But in 2024, the most exciting and eccentric coverage is happening on TikTok. Fans are getting direct access to life in the Olympic Village from their favourite athletes. The spontaneous nature of the content makes it more human, relatable and engaging than the official programming from NBC Universal, BBC or Eurosport. Norwegian swimmer Henrik Christiansen aka Muffin Man has become one of the breakout stars of the games, not for swimming but for his obsession with chocolate muffins from the Olympic Village cafeteria. He has generated more than 100 million views documenting his love affair with the baked good. The democratization of media has a the unfolding of several unexpected subplots. From Turkey’s nonchalant marksman turned meme, Yusuf Dikec who won silver in the air pistol competition wearing casual clothing. To “Aunty” Ni, the 61-year-old grandmother who won her first game in the women’s table tennis. And Stephen Nedoroscik aka pommel horse guy who charmed the internet with his Rubik’s cube, prescription glasses and commitment to the niche apparatus. The lesson for marketers is simple, don’t just focus on tentpole moments and big celebrity names. Your message will get lost. A better strategy is to tap into niches where you can find immense passion and energy. Going niche is the best way to achieve mainstream appeal.

In the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, the USA won a whopping 44 Gold Olympic medals, in contrast to China’s 16 Gold medals. The Beijing Olympics announced China as an economic, political and sporting superpower on the international stage. China finished the Beijing 2008 Olympics ranked first with 48 gold medals. What is perhaps less documented is China’s strategic plan since the 1980s to become an Olympic heavyweight. The masterplan began with a shortlist of sports with the highest potential for a gold medal. Before expanding to medal-rich sports where China traditionally had limited representation. This was known as Project 119—named after the number of gold medals available in the events—which included track and field, swimming and water sports. Finally, since 2008, China has targeted more internationally popular sports. China invested in 3,000 state-run sports schools and more than 400,000 students were enrolled in sports schools in 2005 ahead of the 2008 Olympics. It combined centralized investment and grassroots development to identify, develop and train the best talent in the country. Unlike China’s long-term vision and investment, many companies operate under the tyranny of quarterly results. If China made decisions for the next Summer Olympic Games rather than future generations, its results would be vastly different. The lack of time, space and vision for the future prevents companies from imagining a future that is different to the current reality.

In an exclusive video of “The Daily Show Presents: Jordan Klepper Fingers The Pulse” shared with TheWrap, Klepper steps into the field for the first time since the assassination attempt to chat with Trump supporters in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania — the site of the shooting — about the event and the state of the race. When asking rally attendees about the shooting, Klepper was met with a number of conspiracy theories, with supporters telling him they believe it’s an “inside job” and a “planned job,” with one noting “a lot of things aren’t adding up — it’s very strange.” MAGA supporters pointed their fingers at a variety of culprits who they believed plan the shooting, with answers including “the dems,” “the Left,” “the deep state,” “the government” and, yes, Obama. “I think that [Obama] surely knew about it,” one attendee said. Klepper also asked the MAGA fans how they’re coping with the loss of their “favorite punching bag” — Joe Biden — after the current President dropped out of the race, first chatting with an avid supporter attending his 82nd rally. “I’m sad because of all I’ve invested in all this anti-Biden gear,” the man said, totallng the cost of the merchandise as “thousands of dollars.” “I buy it at the ‘Let’s Go Brandon’ store in Toms River, New Jersey … I think they’re gonna have to rename.” As Trump’s fan base shift their attacks to new presidential nominee Kamala Harris, Klepper couldn’t help but point out the party’s division when it comes to how exactly one should mispronounce her name. “I appreciate that you’re trying to say the name correctly,” Klepper remarked to a supporter, who insisted, “Actually I’m not,” and likened his pronunciation of “Kamala” to how Bush mispronounced Saddam Hussein’s name. “Is this you workshopping elevating Kamala to Saddam Hussein levels?” Klepper asked, to which the supporter replied. “Kamala Harris is a bigger threat,” adding that she’s “the most anti-American candidate for president we’ve ever had.” You can watch the full video above. “The Daily Show” will air from the Democratic National Convention in Chicago during the week of August 19th, with the news team hosting Monday through Wednesday before Jon Stewart takes the reins on Thursday.

No Republican nominee has won that state since Richard Nixon in 1972, yet Donald Trump has campaigned there numerous times over the summer. I’m told Trump's been campaigning in a solidly blue state, because he believes he could win it. At that time, polls suggested he was on course to defeating Joe Biden. He believed he could expand the electoral map. But Biden dropped out on July 21. Trump’s latest rally was last week. Why? I’m told it’s because he hasn’t adjusted to Kamala Harris yet. Perhaps, but perhaps this, too: Trump didn’t adjust, because he never adjusts. He can’t. He does not learn from successes (the 2016 election) or failures (2020). Trump is running the same campaign he ran the last two times. The chief difference is the degree of horror. While he wasn’t openly dictatorial eight years ago, he’s now telling voters to vote this time like it’s their last time. After that, they won’t have to vote again. I don’t have hard evidence to back up this statement. (Yes, I do pay attention to politics, but not to everything political.) I just think it’s plainly obvious. I do concede it didn’t look that way as long as Joe Biden was in the race, and it didn’t look that way, because the Washington press corps had made a fetish of the president’s age. Little else could break through The Narrative, not even the plainly obvious observation that Doald Trump is running the same old campaign. I expect things to change now that Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee. (It was made official this weekend when she secured enough delegates to no longer be the presumptive nominee.) As voters notice he’s running the same old campaign, I hope they’ll notice something else that was hard to see as long as the president was in the running. The Republican presidential nominee is also an old man. It wouldn’t be unreasonable to expect voters to wake up, as they often do in the fall, to a new understanding: Oh yes, of course! Donald Trump is running the same old campaign, because he’s also an old man! (As I’m writing this, Morning Consult, the polling firm, released the results of its latest survey, showing that 51 percent of respondents said Trump is too old to be president while 12 percent (!) said Harris is. We can expect that 51 percent to climb higher as long as the question is asked.) The Harris campaign is encouraging that view, without being obvious about it, by using normal liberal rhetoric about a “conservative” opposition that wants to take us back to a time when women and racial and sexual minorities had few legal rights. With broader awareness of Trump’s age, there’s no need to mention his authoritarian tendencies. Of course he wants to take us back. He’s an old man! Her campaign encourages that view also by framing the election as a choice, for voters, between “freedom and chaos,” with the subliminal understanding that a campaign like Harris’ can adjust to changing circumstances for the purpose of securing greater freedoms for all while a campaign like Trump’s only flounders. It bumbles around the country, as it has for eight straight years. Of course Trump can’t let go of a blue state he has no hope of taking from Harris. He’s an old man! We tend to forget that Trump has been campaigning against Joe Biden since 2019 when, as president, he extorted the leader of a foreign country into a conspiracy to defraud the American people. He wanted Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to say – not do, just say – his government was investigating Biden for corrupt acts while vice president. Trump wanted to smear Biden before his campaign started. It didn’t work, but since then, Trump hasn’t really bothered trying to win elections. He hasn’t bothered trying to expand his base of support to include highly coveted swing voters who determine the outcomes of presidential elections. For 2020, instead of increasing his share of the 2016 electorate (about 46 percent), he doubled down on it, growing his stake by less than a point. Instead of trying to win, he just declared himself the winner, thus paving the way for a failed J6 insurrection. Instead of trying in 2024, Trump did the same old same old. With the help of the GOP, rightwing media allies and, lest we forget, Russian operatives, he built an international apparatus by which to sabotage Joe Biden’s public image. Over four years, rightwing discourse became totalizing in its orientation toward smearing Biden as too old, too weak, too feeble. Trump did what he has always done, and thanks to the Washington press corps and Democrats who are vulnerable to what the press corps thinks of them, it finally worked. Biden’s public image, after June’s Disaster Debate, was so irreparable he dropped out. But it worked too soon. You could say Trump’s smear job against the president climaxed prematurely, and now that the vice president has taken over, Trump doesn’t know what to do after so many years of doing the same old same old. There’s not enough time to establish a new context of bullshit to which the press corps can give the benefit of the doubt, and, in effect, erode Harris’ support among those highly coveted swing voters as well as from inside the Democratic Party. Trump can’t adjust, won’t adjust. He’s running the same campaign he ran the first two times. And if you need more proof, consider this: his greatest accomplishment has been knocking Biden out of the running by mounting a massive, yearslong effort to smear him for being too old to be president. And now that the same charges are backfiring against him, what does Trump do? Nothing, except more of the same.","summary":"A question occurred to me last week as I was watching a clip from the former president’s rally in suburban Minnesota: Why was the former president campaigning in suburban Minnesota?

Walz said he “can’t wait to debate” Vance “if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up,” an apparent quip about the false claim that went viral on social media that Vance wrote about a sex act involving a couch in his book “Hillbilly Elegy.” Walz also attacked Vance for having grown up “in the heartland” then going on to Yale and having a “career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires” before writing a “bestseller trashing that community . . . come on, that’s not what Middle America is,” Walz said. Democrats have repeatedly used the term “weird” to refer to Republicans in recent weeks, and Walz has been widely credited with helping spread the messaging, after his viral MSNBC appearance in which he described Vance and Trump as “weird” for what he called their attacks on “freedom: freedom to be in your bedroom, freedom to be in your exam room, freedom to tell your kids what they can read.” Walz later explained to The New York Times the characterization is specific to Trump and Vance, not Republicans generally. Tangent Walz appeared alongside Harris as Democrats are experiencing a honeymoon of sorts following President Joe Biden’s July 21 exit from the race, marking an end to weeks of intraparty turmoil and sagging polls. Harris has since surpassed Trump in most polling averages after Trump led Biden for months. Recognizing the renewed enthusiasm, Walz thanked Harris for “bringing back the joy” on Tuesday. Harris, prior to Walz taking the stage, touted his background as a high school teacher, football coach and National Guardsman before his entrance into politics, casting him as a product of working-class middle America with solid family values. “Tim is more than a governor,” she said. “To his former high school students, he was Mr. Walz. To his football players, he was Coach, and in 91 days, the nation will know Coach Walz by another name: vice president of the United States.” Key Background Harris announced Walz as her running mate earlier Tuesday, ending weeks of speculation and a vetting process that reportedly involved nearly a dozen contenders, including Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who introduced Walz and Harris in his home state Tuesday. Walz, who was born in Nebraska and grew up working on his family farm, is widely viewed among Democrats as a candidate who can help build support among the working-class and in crucial battleground states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Walz served 12 years in Congress, representing a conservative district in southern Minnesota, prior to his election as governor in 2018.

On Tuesday (August 6), Vice President Harris, 59, announced that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, 60, would join her on the Democratic ticket. Walz beat out a crowded field of rivals to be the Democratic pick for VP, including Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. “An extraordinary missed opportunity,” Griffin, 35, who has previously praised Governor Shapiro, wrote on X/Twitter. In a since-deleted tweet, Griffin also suggested that Walz’s left-wing politics would be “radioactive with swing voters.” She went on to list Walz’s pros and cons. Under “pros” she wrote: “Strong midwestern messenger; executive experience as a governor; likely an effective surrogate in critical swing states of MI & WI; flipped a swing seat in Congress.” Under “cons” she wrote: “Seen as very progressive on guns & Gaza; not viewed as a moderating force on the ticket.” Harris and Walz made their debut as running mates on Tuesday, kicking off a campaign against Republican nominees Donald Trump and JD Vance in front of an electrified crowd in Philadelphia. Harris told the estimated 12,000 people in attendance that she had “set out to find a partner who can build this brighter future” during her weeks-old campaign for the presidency. She added that her search for a running-mate led her to look for a “leader who can unite this nation and move us forward,” someone who was “a fighter for the middle class” and “a patriot who believes as I do the extraordinary promise of America, a promise of freedom, opportunity and justice not just for some but for all.” Walz is a former high school teacher who enlisted in the US Army National Guard at 17 years old and served for 24 years, then spent more than two decades teaching and coaching football before entering politics. Meanwhile, Griffin describes herself as a “Republican in exile.” After several years of working in various roles within the Trump administration, she assumed the role of the White House spokesperson and assistant to the president in April 2020. Eight months later, she resigned from the role before joining The View permanently in 2022. Days after Biden abandoned his re-election campaign and endorsed Harris, Griffin praised the VP’s campaign, saying: “I am blown away by her digital operation. “[She] had 24 hours to stand this up. She is all over TikTok, she has turned things that seem cringy into making her seem cool. This feels Obama-level energy and Trump world is not ready for it.” Griffin has previously argued that Trump is “not as sharp as he was in 2016.” “[He’s] not even as sharp as he was in 2020,” she said in March. “For some reason, that doesn’t necessarily come across to voters the same way.” Back in 2020, when Griffin announced she was departing Trump’s administration, she called the role an “honor of a lifetime.” She said that she was “deeply proud of the incredible things we were able to accomplish to make our country stronger, safer, and more secure.”","summary":"Griffin appeared to show support instead for Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-view-tim-walz-kamala-harris-b2592325.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/07/00/MixCollage-06-Aug-2024-04-38-PM-7255.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/uHUVtHuZ-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-07 00:13:25","author":"Tom Murray","authors":["Tom Murray"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.108},{"id":253538864,"title":"Some Democratic backers of Josh Shapiro see a missed chance for a Jewish vice president","text":"PHILADELPHIA — Vice President Kamala Harris’ choice of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate disappointed fans of Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who was one of Harris’ finalists for the job and seen as someone who could help Democrats win a key swing state and make history by electing the first Jewish vice president. With his history of winning three statewide elections in Pennsylvania, Shapiro was seen as someone with particular appeal to moderate voters. His state’s 19 votes in the Electoral College have long been critical for candidates trying to reach the necessary 270 to win. But the same things about Shapiro that appealed to moderates angered some on the left in his party: his support for a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure as well as particularly his support for Israel’s war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Some Democrats lamented what they said was a missed opportunity by bypassing Shapiro. Republicans, meanwhile, tried to paint Harris’ choice as a snub to Jewish voters, a traditionally Democratic constituency that former President Donald Trump has tried to court in this year’s race. “Not only is he exceptionally smart and capable, but, in my opinion, he brought the math to the path of 270,” said Ryan Bizzarro, 38-year-old Democratic state lawmaker from Erie, Pennsylvania, said of Shapiro. Shapiro spoke at a rally in Philadelphia Tuesday night before the new Democratic ticket took the stage, with the Pennsylvania governor receiving big applause from thousands of attendees. “I love you Philly. You know what else I love, I love being your governor,” Shapiro said. He added, “I am going to continue pouring my heart and soul into continuing to serve you every single day as your governor.” Shapiro also praised Walz as a great man with strong midwestern values, calling him a friend he said he couldn’t wait for Pennsylvanians to get to know. Walz returned the compliment when he took the stage later with Harris in Philadelphia. “My God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro,” he said. “Holy hell, can this guy bring the fire.” Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for Shapiro, also spoke at the event and said Democrats should not let Republicans and detractors divide them over the pick. “Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that’s it. Period. End of story,” Parker said. Republicans try to take advantage of Shapiro not being picked A number of high-profile Republicans sought to seize on the liberal pushback Shapiro faced over his stance on Israel, suggesting that Shapiro was not picked as Harris’ running mate because of antisemitic attitudes in the Democratic Party. Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, told reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday that it seemed Harris didn’t pick Shapiro because Democrats feared “grassroots activists in their party wouldn’t take a Jewish nominee.”","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris' choice of Minnesota Gov.

Tim Walz as the ‘vice president America deserves’","text":"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — Kamala Harris introduced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to the nation at a raucous rally Tuesday in battleground Pennsylvania that was aimed at building momentum for the newly minted Democratic presidential ticket in the sprint toward Election Day. “He’s the kind of person who makes people feel like they belong and then inspires them to dream big. … That’s the kind of vice president America deserves,” Harris said while standing with Walz in Philadelphia. Taking the microphone after Harris, Walz revved up the crowd for the rigorous campaign to come. “We’ve got 91 days. My God, that’s easy. We’ll sleep when we’re dead,” he said. The remarks reflected the urgency of the moment, with Harris tapping Walz for the ticket during one of the most turbulent periods in modern American politics. Republicans have rallied around former President Donald Trump after he was targeted in an attempted assassination in July. Just days later, President Joe Biden ended his reelection campaign, forcing Harris to scramble to unify Democrats and decide on a running mate over a breakneck two-week stretch. In choosing the 60-year-old Walz, Harris is elevating a Midwestern governor, military veteran and union supporter who helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families. It was her biggest decision yet as the Democratic nominee and she went with a broadly palatable choice — someone who says politics should have more joy and who deflects dark and foreboding rhetoric from Republicans with a lighter touch, a strategy that the campaign has been increasingly turning to since Harris took over the top spot. Harris hopes Walz will help her shore up her campaign’s standing across the upper Midwest, a critical region in presidential politics that often serves as a buffer for Democrats seeking the White House. The party remains haunted by Trump’s wins in Michigan and Wisconsin in 2016. Trump lost those states in 2020 but has zeroed in on them as he aims to return to the presidency this year and is expanding his focus to Minnesota. Since Walz was announced, the team raised more than $20 million from grassroots donations, the campaign said. Walz is far from a household name. An ABC News/Ipsos survey conducted before he was selected but after vetting began showed that nearly 9 in 10 U.S. adults did not know enough to have an opinion about him. Harris devoted much of her speech to telling the audience about Walz’s life and work, which included stints as a social studies teacher and a football coach. “To those who know him best, Tim is more than a governor,” she said. “We both believe in lifting people up, not knocking them down,” she said. “We both know that the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us. And we see in our fellow Americans neighbors, never enemies.” Harris, the first Black woman and person of South Asian descent to lead a major party ticket, initially considered nearly a dozen candidates before zeroing in on a handful of serious contenders. Trump has focused much of his campaign on appealing to men, emphasizing a need for strength in national leadership and even featuring the wrestler Hulk Hogan on the final night of the Republican National Convention. Harris’ finalists — all white men — marked an acknowledgement of the Democrat’s need to at least try to win over some of that demographic. She personally interviewed three finalists: Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly and Walz. Harris wanted someone with executive experience who could be a governing partner, and Walz also offered appeal to the widest swath of the diverse coalition. His selection drew praise from lawmakers as ideologically diverse as progressive leader Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and independent Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a moderate who left the Democratic Party earlier this year. A team of lawyers and political operatives led by former Attorney General Eric Holder pored over documents and conducted interviews with potential selections. Harris mulled the decision over on Monday with top aides and finalized it Tuesday morning, according to three people familiar with Harris’ decision who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private deliberations. Shapiro, an ambitious politician in his own right, struggled with the idea of being No. 2 at the White House and said he felt he had more to do in Pennsylvania, according to one of the people familiar with Harris’ decision. There was also public pushback to Shapiro for his stance on Israel from Arab American groups and younger voters angry over the administration’s response to the Israel-Hamas war. The other contenders threw their support behind the ticket Tuesday, and Shapiro was one of the speakers at Tuesday’s Philadelphia rally. Biden described the Harris and Walz ticket as “a powerful voice for working people and America’s great middle class.” Walz coined one of Democrats’ buzziest campaign bits to date, calling Trump and his running mate Ohio Sen. JD Vance “just weird,” a label that the Democratic Governors Association — of which Walz is chairman — amplified in a post on X and Democrats more broadly have echoed. On Tuesday, Walz said: “Just an observation of mind, I just have to say it. These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell.” Harris, second gentleman Doug Emhoff and Walz will spend the next five days touring critical battleground states, visiting Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday and Arizona and Nevada later in the week. Vance, for his part, planned stops in some of the same areas. He said Tuesday that he called Walz earlier in the day and left a voice message. The Trump campaign on Tuesday immediately tried to tag Walz as a far-left liberal. “It’s no surprise that San Francisco Liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate – Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State,” said Karoline Leavitt, Trump’s campaign press secretary. Trump, who often weighs in on the news on his social media network, posted simply, “THANK YOU!” after the news of Walz’s selection was public. He followed up with another post a few hours later, proclaiming “This is the most Radical Left duo in American history” and suggested Biden “feels that he made a historically tragic mistake” and would try to get back in the race again. Walz, who grew up in the small town of West Point, Nebraska, was a teacher, coach and union member at Mankato West High School in Minnesota before entering politics. He won the first of six terms in Congress in 2006 from a mostly rural southern Minnesota district and used the office to champion veterans issues. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard, rising to command sergeant major, one of the highest enlisted ranks in the military, although he didn’t complete all the training before he retired so his rank for benefits purposes was set at master sergeant. He ran for governor in 2018 on the theme of “One Minnesota” and won by more than 11 points. David Ivory, a 46-year-old St. Paul resident, rode over to Walz’s residence on his bike with his kids shortly after the announcement to deliver their congratulations. “He’s just down to earth. He gets it. He can talk to anybody,” Ivory said. “He doesn’t seem like he’s above anybody.” As governor, Walz had to find ways to work in his first term with a legislature split between a Democratic-controlled House and a Republican-led Senate. Minnesota has a history of divided government, though, and the arrangement was surprisingly productive in his first year. Walz easily won reelection in 2022, and Democrats flipped the Senate to win full control of both chambers and the governor’s office for the first time in eight years. A big reason was the Dobbs decision from the conservative-majority Supreme Court that overturned a federal right to an abortion. Walz currently serves as co-chair of the bipartisan Council of Governors, advising the president and the Cabinet on homeland security and national defense issues. He was first appointed to the position by Trump, then later reappointed by Biden. Miller, Long and Kim reported from Washington. Karnowski reported from Minneapolis. Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo and Michelle L. Price in New York and Michael Goldberg in Minneapolis contributed to this report.","summary":"“We’ve got 91 days. My God, that’s easy.

For her, the court’s Dobbs abortion ruling is a menacing threat — “a national movement afoot to attack hard won and hard fought freedoms.” Yet her record as California attorney general suggests she’d be the one willing to roll back important freedoms — including the First Amendment-based expectation that we can express our opinions without being intimidated into silence if our views are unpopular. She made that clear a decade ago when she targeted Americans for Prosperity, the free market-oriented nonprofit supported by libertarians Charles and David Koch. Her interpretation of the law was so extreme that, incredibly, the Kochs were joined in their legal defense by two liberal bastions: the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP. Harris, in other words, was too far left for the left. Her actions as state AG should spark concern about how a President Harris — especially her administration’s Internal Revenue Service — would protect those holding views that clash with her own. Here’s the background of the case, which Harris’ AG successor ultimately lost before the US Supreme Court. In 2012, AG Harris moved to reinterpret a California statute requiring nonprofit charities to report the names of donors contributing more than $5,000. There was no obvious law enforcement reason to do so; such “Schedule B” reports, including all those names, were already required by the IRS, and Harris’ predecessors had deemed that sufficient. If criminal offenses were suspected, Harris as attorney general could have subpoenaed the necessary records. But California progressives at the time were obsessed with the influence of “dark money” — at least when it came to conservatives pushing back against the state’s high taxes and expansive government. They wanted names. Americans for Prosperity was concerned that revealing donor names to a hostile state agency might result in their becoming public. They had good reason to worry: Between 2012 and 2021, as Harris and her successors doggedly continued their efforts during subsequent-court action, the state “inadvertently” posted more than 1,700 Schedule B forms on a public website. Conservatives had already seen the personal risks that came with public disclosure of donor names in California. The state’s requirement for public reporting of contributions to political campaigns or referendum drives had made that clear. In 2008, a public shaming campaign spotlighted the identities of those who had financially supported Proposition 8, a ballot referendum that, when it passed, briefly banned gay marriage in California. Disclosure of his $1,000 donation was used to force the 2014 resignation of Mozilla CEO Brendan Eich, unceremoniously ousted from the company he helped to launch in the key role as chief technical officer. Even small business owners who had supported the referendum for religious reasons faced blowback. The owner of a Sacramento dairy told NPR that he “soon started getting very nasty e-mails and letters and phone calls by the hundreds” after being outed as a Prop 8 donor. Leaks of the names of charitable donors would expand those risks. The fear of one’s name and address becoming public would, as the ACLU would put it, “infringe on associational privacy” and threaten First Amendment rights. In opposing the Koch-ACLU-NAACP lawsuit in federal court, Harris had to brush off a chilling federal judicial precedent, one involving the threat of racial violence. In 1958, the Supreme Court acted to protect the NAACP from disclosing its membership lists in the landmark NAACP v. Alabama. In a unanimous decision, the justices ruled that publishing the organization’s membership list would “likely interfere with the free association of its members” — not to mention, in Jim Crow Alabama, expose its members to the threat of lynching. Six decades later, in 2021, Chief Justice John Roberts cited that precedent to rule against Harris’ argument. Her “promise of confidentiality was illusory,” Roberts wrote in his 6-3 majority opinion. Here’s a chilling thought: a Harris administration as lax as her California office was in protecting the names of millions of donors to right-of-center causes. Such records are currently held by the IRS — which of course has already failed to protect the personal tax records of wealthy Americans like Citadel’s Ken Griffin, who have found themselves demonized by the left-wing ProPublica in stories based on illegally leaked tax returns. Kamala Harris’ campaign for the presidency brings new attention to her record as a law enforcement official in California, where she exercised executive power. Her key role in seeking to disclose the names of conservative donors reveals her hypocrisy about the right to privacy, at least in matters other than abortion — and her ruthless willingness to wield government authority against her opponents.

In his first speech since becoming the presumptive vice presidential candidate, Walz roasted Donald Trump and J.D. Vance, as he declared that the next 91 days would not just be about winning the election, but to doing it “with a sense of joy.” The mood inside Temple University’s basketball arena was certainly joyful — ebullient even, bordering on orgiastic. Crowded together under enormous “Harris and Walz” signs and sporting light-up wristbands like the kind Taylor Swift gives out at the Eras Tour, Philadelphians helped Harris and Walz kick off a tour of their own: a five-day blitz through seven battleground states, starting with the most important one on the map for Democrats this November: Pennsylvania. The pair walked out on stage together early Tuesday evening, just hours after a fleet of black SUVs converged on the Minnesota governor’s St. Paul residence early Tuesday morning and plunged him directly into the center of the 2024 election vortex, and one day after Harris clinched the top spot on the Democratic ticket. Addressing the throngs of screaming supporters, Harris introduced the world to Walz: a teacher, national guardsman, congressman, governor, and coach that helped take a high school football team from a winless season to state championship. When it was Walz’ turn to speak, he told the crowd that it was his students who inspired him to get into politics. “They encouraged me to run for office. They saw in me what I was hoping to instill in them: a commitment of common good, a belief that one person can make a difference,” Walz said. “And because high school teachers are super optimistic, I was running in a district that had one Democrat since 1892.” Walz went on to draw a contrast between the work he did when he arrived in Congress — on the Veterans Affairs committee and on behalf of rural communities — with Trump’s priorities as president, and the Republican Party at large. “Some of us are old enough to remember … when the Republicans were the party of freedom,” Walz said. “It turns out now what they meant was the government should be free to invade your doctor’s office. In Minnesota, we respect our neighbors and their personal choices that they make — even if we want to make the same choice for ourselves. There’s a golden rule: mind your own damn business.” He also, as he has done in the weeks leading up Harris tapping him as her running mate on Tuesday, went after Trump and Vance. “These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell,” he said to huge applause. “That’s what you see. That’s what you see.” Walz even joked about an unfounded rumor that Vance had sex with a couch. “I can’t wait to the debate the guy,” he said before waiting several seconds for the applause to subside. “That is if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.” If the crowd’s reaction was any indication, they approved of Harris’s choice in a running mate. The vice president had a historically truncated window to consider a decision after she emerged as the party’s choice to take on Trump when President Joe Biden decided to leave the race last month. She chose Walz over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, who who was also on hand on Tuesday. Shapiro took the stage to thunderous applause, taking several beats to soak it up before telling the crowd, as if to preempt any accusations of hard feelings, “I love you Philadelphia — and you know what else I love? I love being your governor.” Harris’ choice has been widely praised online, and certainly in Philadelphia on Tuesday, but even as Walz has received a warm welcome, some attendees at Tuesday’s rally admitted they weren’t well acquainted with Walz before his name began circulating in the veepstakes. Tameka Bates, a SIEU union member, was thrilled to see Harris. But as for Walz? “I don’t know much about him, I’ve just heard about him this morning,” she said. Jan Ostroff said she had only learned of Walz in the last few weeks as his profile rose as he appeared on TV auditioning for the role of amiable attack dog. “I would have been happy with any of her choices for vice president, but I’m really happy with him, because this way we get to keep Josh Shapiro for ourselves for a little while longer,” Ostroff said. The near-universal praise of Walz — from figures as far apart ideologically as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Joe Manchin — stood in stark contrast to the Republican party’s reception of J.D. Vance just a few weeks before. Vance, who had a favorability of -5 percent when Trump asked him to join the ticket has only seen his standing tank to -14 percent as more Americans have gotten to know him, earning him the distinction of being the least-liked vice presidential pick in history. (It’s hardly surprising considering Vance’s three biggest media moments have revolved around a false rumor that he fucked a couch, ongoing damage control about his 2021 attacking “childless cat ladies,” and a charming anecdote in which he told his son to “shut the hell up” while he was on the phone with Trump. Ahead of the love-fest at Temple University, Vance held his own appearance in Philadelphia, attended by a comparatively small smattering of supporters. The Trump campaign made the questionable decision of sending Vance on the road to hold an event in every city that Harris and Walz are set to hold events in this week. The split screen in Philadelphia was stark. Vance struggled to fill a room with a one-tenth of the capacity of the arena the Democratic ticket was appearing. He spoke in front of a banner that read “Kamala Chaos,” but it was hung too low, so event attendees blocked out “Chaos” and at first glance it looked like Vance was at a Harris event. Trump, meanwhile, is spending the week at Mar-a-Lago, where, yesterday, he met with a seat-sniffing Kick streamer, who may have violated FEC rules by gifting Trump both a Rolex and Cyber Truck emblazoned with his image. He has just one appearance planned this week, in Montana.","summary":"The Minnesota governor announced himself as Kamala Harris’ running mate in front of a massive crowd in the swing state","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/tim-walz-trump-vance-philadelphia-rally-1235074871/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/walz-and-harris-attack-dog.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 00:07:22","author":"Tessa Stuart,Tessa Suart","authors":["Tessa Stuart","Tessa Suart"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.373},{"id":253538712,"title":"Walz attacks Trump, Vance in first appearance as Harris’s running mate: 'They are creepy, weird'","text":"Tim Walz made a strong debut as Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate, launching sharp attacks against former President Donald Trump and Republican vice-presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance (Ohio) at a rally in Philadelphia.In a spirited speech, Walz took aim at Trump and Vance, echoing a viral new characterization of the Trump campaign. “I just have to say it. You know it. You feel it. These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell. That’s what you see,” Walz told the energized crowd, drawing loud applause.Walz warned that a second Trump presidency would be even more damaging than the first, predicting a rollback of key social programs and a nationwide abortion ban. “If Trump gets a chance to return, he’s going to pick up exactly where he left off four years ago. Only this time, it will be much, much worse,” Walz said, highlighting the stakes of the upcoming election.The Minnesota governor contrasted his working-class background with Trump’s wealth and privilege. “He never sat at that kitchen table, like the one I grew up at, wondering how we were going to pay the bills. He sat at his country club in Mar-a-Lago, wondering how he can cut taxes for his rich friends,” Walz said.— KamalaHQ (@KamalaHQ) Turning his attention to Vance, Walz accused his vice-presidential rival of sharing Trump’s “dangerous and backward agenda.” Walz sarcastically noted Vance’s privileged path to prominence, “Like all regular people I grew up with in the heartland, JD studied at Yale, had his career funded by Silicon Valley billionaires, and then wrote a bestseller trashing that community. Come on! That’s not what middle America is,” Walz said, expressing eagerness for the upcoming debate.Walz’s selection as Harris’s running mate came after a competitive “veepstakes” following President Biden’s unexpected decision to exit the 2024 race. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly were also considered top contenders for the vice-presidential slot.The Harris-Walz ticket is set to challenge the Trump-Vance ticket this fall, with Walz’s rise fueled by his recent viral branding of Republicans as “weird,” a term now being embraced by other leading Democrats.","summary":"","url":"https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/walz-attacks-trump-and-vance-in-first-appearance-as-harriss-running-mate-they-are-creepy-weird-as-hell/articleshow/112331495.cms","image":"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/resizemode-4,width-1280,height-720,msid-112331626/112331626.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 00:06:50","author":"Toi World Desk","authors":["Toi World Desk"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"IN","sentiment":0.073},{"id":253538412,"title":"Running mate: Obama, Clinton hail Harris on Minnesota gov choice","text":"Kamala Harris said Tuesday she was “proud” to pick Tim Walz as her running mate, opting for the Minnesota governor with blue-collar credentials as the partner most likely to boost her historic White House bid. Walz had been on a vice-presidential shortlist with a string of other Democratic figures seen as broadening Harris’s appeal as she sprints into the contest against Donald Trump. Aiming to make history as the first woman United States president, Harris – already a trailblazer as the first female and first Black and South Asian vice president – has little time before Election Day on November 5, AFP reports. “I am proud to announce that I’ve asked Tim Walz to be my running mate,” she posted on X. “As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his. It’s great to have him on the team.” President Joe Biden quickly expressed support for his deputy’s “great decision” to choose Walz, saying the duo “will be a powerful voice for working people and America’s great middle class.” In a statement shared on his X handle on Tuesday, former US President Barack Obama, and his wife, Michelle, also commended the Harris-Walz ticket. Obama said, “Like Vice President Harris, Governor #Tim_Walz believes that government works to serve us. Not just some of us, but all of us. That’s what makes him an outstanding governor, and that’s what will make him an even better Vice President. Michelle and I couldn’t be happier for Tim and Gwen, their family, and our country,” he wrote. Ex-President Bill Clinton also said on X that Walz had walked the walk, “and he’ll be a great vice president.” Expectations had always been that Harris would pick a white man to balance the ticket and help win over working-class, white, male voters, a demographic that propelled Trump to victory in 2016. Walz fits that description as a 60-year-old Midwesterner with a folksy manner, decades of military experience and a rural perspective. He dismisses the “nonsense” of Trump and Republican running mate J.D. Vance, and he is also a gun owner who tweets about hunting, goes ice-fishing and rides rollercoasters with his daughter. The onetime teacher and school sports coach flipped a Republican district in 2006 to win a seat in the House of Representatives in a state seen as light years from the coastal elites of California, Harris’s home turf, or the East Coast. At the same time, Walz will appeal to the left to champion cannabis legalization, worker protections, abortion rights, and tighter firearm restrictions. Trump’s campaign branded the Minnesotan as a “dangerously liberal extremist” seeking to impose California values on the nation. Democratic grandee Nancy Pelosi swatted such criticism aside, telling MSNBC that Walz “is right down the middle. He’s a heartland of America Democrat.” Walz earned enthusiastic endorsements from Democratic liberals as well as centrists like Senator Joe Manchin, who called him “the real deal.” After being named by Harris, he said it was the “honour of a lifetime” and quipped it felt like “the first day of school.” The pair will hit the campaign trail immediately, launching a five-day swing through battleground states starting Tuesday in the biggest prize, Pennsylvania.","summary":"Kamala Harris said Tuesday she was “proud” to pick Tim Walz as her running mate, opting for the Minnesota governor with blue-collar credentials as the partner most likely to boost her historic White House bid.

He was, she said, “the kind of teacher and mentor that every child in America dreams of having”. She told a story about him agreeing to be faculty adviser to his school’s gay-straight alliance, knowing “the signal it would send to have a football coach get involved”. He was, “the kind of coach, because he’s the kind of person, who inspires people to dream big”. Harris also spoke about Walz’s skills as a marksman, and his views on the second amendment: he is in favour, but with caveats for background checks and red flags. Walz was the highest ranking enlisted man to ever serve in US congress and the top Democrat on the veterans’ committee, she said. He was also known as one of Capitol Hill’s best marksmen. She also used football references, comparing him and Vance to “a matchup between the varsity team and the [junior varsity] squad”. Walz, who like Harris is known for his smile, started his speech by saying: “Thank you for the trust you put in me, but more so, thank you for bringing back the joy. “If Donald Trump and JD Vance are irritated that Kamala Harris smiles and laughs, they’re really going to be irritated by Tim Walz,” Melissa Hortman, the Democratic speaker of Minnesota’s house of representatives, told the Guardian on Tuesday. He also said: “Don’t ever underestimate teachers.” Walz’s wife, Gwen, is a teacher, too. When Walz talked about Trump, he pivoted quickly, and effectively, from talking about Republicans interfering with healthcare, to his own daughter being born thanks to IVF, to children fearing that they will be shot at school. “In Minnesota we respect our neighbours for the personal choices they make,” he said. “That includes IVF.” He talked about his daughter Hope, who often appears in videos and photographs with her father, being born through IVF. Abortion opponents have been increasingly pushing for broader measures that would give rights and protections to embryos and fetuses, which could have huge implications for fertility treatments and other areas of healthcare. Walz said “It wasn’t by chance that, when we welcomed our daughter into the world, we named her Hope.” Then he said that when he and Harris talk about freedom, they mean the freedom to make your own choice about your body, and the freedom for children to go to school and not worry about being shot. He called on people to “settle our political differences not with violence, but with votes” and said of Trump: “Don’t believe him when he plays dumb. He knows exactly what Project 2025 will to do restrict our freedoms.” He added of a second Trump term: “Only this time it will be much, much worse.” Walz seasoned his remarks with midwestern dialect, adding a “damn well” here and a “come on” there. “Say it with me! We are not going back,” he said, starting a chant from the audience. “We’ve got 91 days. My God, that’s easy,” he said. “We’ll sleep when we’re dead.” Walz made a couch reference. Walz said his GOP rival and Trump “are creepy and yes, they’re weird as hell”. He added that he “can’t wait to debate the guy”. Then, to sustained cheers and laughter, he made a reference to the baseless, but much-shared, claim that JD Vance admitted to having sex with a couch in his memoir. “That is if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.” Stumping earlier today in Pennsylvania, Vance said, “I absolutely want to debate Tim Walz,” but not until after the Democratic convention.","summary":"Democrats lay out vision for America and attack Trump and Vance at Philadelphia event\n\n\nWho is Tim Walz?\nHow could Walz’s political record help and hurt Harris?As we await Kamala Harris’s running mate announcement, Americans in some states are heading to the polls today.\n\nVoters in Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington state will cast ballots in their congressional primaries today.

One word put Kamala Harris on the path to selecting Tim Walz to be her running mate","text":"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, tapped by Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris to be her running mate Tuesday, catapulted from being a relative unknown on the national stage to a vice president contender in a matter of days — largely on the basis of a single word gone viral in various iterations. The word? “Weird.” Walz used it to describe former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee and his vice president pick, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. In a July 23 MSNBC “Morning Joe” segment, Walz said, “These guys are just weird.” The one-word framing caught fire. It spoke to people. And it caught on. Democrats used it. Vice President Harris embraced it. At a rally last week in Atlanta, she said the GOP ticket was “just plain weird.” In this 2024 election, where people have an overload of choices of how to receive political information, it turns out that one word spoke volumes across generations. “Weird” struck the right tone. More punch, in its own way, than the school boy insults Trump uses to taunt Harris, like calling her “low IQ.” And “weird” pushed Walz to the front of the line and in a position to prevail over very capable rivals. Observations: ‘Hi, this is Tim’ The campaign put out a video of Harris calling Walz on Tuesday morning to give him the news. It was evocative of the video Joe Biden’s campaign produced when he called Harris in 2000 to offer her a spot on his ticket. Walz picked up on one ring. “Hi, this is Tim,” he said, as if he did not have a clue who was phoning. Said Harris, “Listen, I want you to do this with me. Lets, lets do this together. Would you be my running mate and let’s get this thing on the road?” He accepted. What Walz was wearing — whether planned or not — showed the image the newly minted Harris-Walz ticket hopes to convey to middle class folks in the crucial swing states. The former Army National Guard reservist was wearing what appeared to be a camouflage cap, black T-shirt, khaki pants and white sports shoes. Every day since Biden announced on July 21 he would not seek another term has been head-spinning. The underestimated Harris locked up the nomination in a day. And something remarkable happened, perhaps grist for political history books. Depressed Democrats saw sunlight. They contributed stunning amounts money, signed up to be volunteers, joined thousands on Zoom calls and recaptured that intangible political exuberance not experienced in years, even before Biden’s decline. The Harris-Walz ticket debuted Tuesday night in Philadelphia. The road to the White House — to 270 electoral votes — goes through swing states Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. The folks in the packed Philadelphia hall affirmed her choice. As for others, they were applauding and validating the Walz selection with their pocketbooks. On Tuesday evening, the campaign reported more than $20 million had been raised since the morning Walz announcement. In Philadelphia, the message was: ‘It’s a fight for the future’ On Monday night, with the virtual roll call complete, Harris became the official Democratic nominee. There will be a symbolic roll call on the second evening of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, running Aug. 19-22. Harris understands what she wants her campaign to be, since fighting over the past Trump seems mired in is not the best formula for winning the White House. “Our campaign is not just against Donald Trump,” she said. The campaign “is a fight for the future.” You’ll be hearing that a lot. At least for now. Harris, by necessity moving fast, did not have the luxury of using months to road-test lines. In talking about Walz, Harris summarized his bio by running through his many titles in easy to remember ways.That’s important, because Walz needs to be introduced to voters. There’s no need, by the way, to be embarrassed if you never heard of Walz before today. A tell on me: In 2008, when Sen. John McCain, the GOP presidential nominee, announced his running mate — then Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin — I had never heard her name. Harris told the story about what you should know about Walz. He’s a governor. A husband. To his kids, Hope and Gus, “he’s a dad.” He is Sgt. Major Walz. For those in his old House district in southern Minnesota, he was Congressman Walz. To his former high school students he was Mr. Walz. To his ex-football players he was Coach. Said Harris, “And in 91 days he’ll be known by another name. Vice President.”","url":"https://chicago.suntimes.com/columnists/2024/08/06/kamala-harris-tim-walz-democratic-vice-president-nominee-trump-vance-weird","image":"https://cst.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3dee8ce/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5033x2873+0+243/resize/1461x834!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchorus-production-cst-web.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2Fdf%2F52%2Fa959d6f1435fb198afc3c02c474a%2Fap24","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 00:02:33","author":"Lynn Sweet","authors":["Lynn Sweet"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.233},{"id":253538382,"title":"AOC Accused of Hypocrisy for Criticizing JD Vance on ‘Manspreading’ Despite Similar Behavior Caught on Camera","text":"Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was slammed for her apparent hypocrisy after putting JD Vance on blast for ‘manspreading’ – then quickly being caught in the same sitting position. The New York congresswoman reacted with distaste to a clip of Vance sitting comfortably in a cushy, wide chair – with his legs spread in a relaxed manner. ‘Why are you sitting like that,’ she wrote on Tuesday, in an apparent jab at Vance’s spread eagle stance. But AOC’s mockery was deconstructed within minutes. Clown World, an account on X known for criticizing liberals, took a screenshot of AOC’s post and placed it side-by-side with her own wide sitting posture from less than two years ago. ‘AOC,’ the account wrote over her criticism of Vance. ‘Also AOC,’ the labeled the image of her wide stance. Many other people replied with the same image of AOC’s wide sitting stance. Another user posted a picture of AOC sitting at a table at a restaurant with her boyfriend Riley Roberts, who was sitting with his legs crossed. ‘Why is he sitting like that,’ the user asked. Vance, former President Donald Trump’s running mate, had been skewered by other liberal accounts on X for how he was sitting during his appearance on the Full Send Podcast last Friday. But with her enormous following, AOC brought new attention to the clip and now, some internet backlash for doing the same thing. The photograph of AOC sitting on stage comes from a campaign event she held in October 2022 ahead of the contentious midterms – a contest where the Republicans captured a majority in the House of Representatives and the Democrats maintained control of the Senate. The event was being held in a small auditorium in her district and several protestors were recorded by X user Danny De Urbina chanting ‘AOC has got to go.’ One man was banging a drum to punctuate the shouts from his allies. The camera then pans back to AOC who was sitting on stage with her legs spread and dancing to the drum beat, trying to appear unbothered by the interruption. One woman could also be heard repeatedly calling AOC a ‘sellout.’ A spokesperson for the liberal congresswoman provided a statement to Newsweek following the event calling the people shouting her down disruptors that were ‘part of a far-right wing group that regularly protests at vaccine clinics, against LGBTQ rights, etc.’ ‘They were not constituents,’ the spokesperson added. ‘We do thank the numerous constituents from Astoria who turned out last night to engage in the civic process. We’re grateful that we were still able to have a meaningful dialogue, in spite of that group of outsiders.’ Vance also has a history of attacking AOC. Back when he was running for his Ohio Senate seat in 2021, he spoke to a Catholic group about her ‘sociopathic’ attitude toward families and children, the Guardian reported. ‘Maybe AOC hasn’t found the right person, whatever the case may be. AOC has said basically – if you look at her public remarks on this – that it’s immoral to have children because of climate change concerns. Right? This is, let’s just be direct, a sociopathic attitude towards family,’ Vance said. AOC did in fact question the ethics of having kids in a world that’s being affected by climate change back shortly after she was elected in 2018. ‘Basically, there’s a scientific consensus that the lives of children are going to be very difficult. And it does lead, I think, young people to have a legitimate question: Is it okay to still have children?’ she said in an Instagram live from March 2019. Vance’s attacks on AOC regarding her views on family was around the time he made his infamous comments about the US being run by ‘a bunch of childless cat ladies,’ remarks that have resurfaced since his VP appointment. He specifically name-dropped Vice President Kamala Harris, AOC and Pete Buttigieg.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez was slammed for her apparent hypocrisy after putting JD Vance on blast for&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: AOC Accused of Hypocrisy for Criticizing JD Vance on &#8216;Manspreading&#8217; Despite Similar Behavior Caught on Camera first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/aoc-accused-of-hypocrisy-for-criticizing-jd-vance-on-manspreading-despite-similar-behavior-caught-on-camera/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-AOC-is-accused-of-hypocrisy-after-she.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 00:00:45","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":253538500,"title":"Fired-Up Philly Crowd Chants ‘He’s a Weirdo’ at First Mention of J.D.

Tim Walz as her running mate Tuesday, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi praised him as a “heartland of American Democrat” and a “down the middle” Midwesterner who will appeal to working class families and rural Americans. In other words, a perfect balance to Oakland-born and Berkeley-raised Harris, the daughter of 1960s Berkeley civil rights activists. Ninety days to the presidential election, Harris and Walz appeared at their first rally together Tuesday afternoon at Temple University in Philadelphia. The indoor arena was bursting with a capacity crowd of about 10,000 people, a stark contrast to a joint Philadelphia rally with Biden and Harris in late May when they filled one-third of a school gym. In front of the deafening crowd, Walz talked about Harris’s career as a prosecutor and attorney general in California and how she “fought on the side of the American people.” Then he launched into his own Midwest upbringing, how he spent summers working on the family farm in Nebraska. “These same values I learned on the family farm and tried to instill in my students, I took to Congress and the state capital, and now, Vice President Harris and I are running to take them to the White House,” he said. He also took a shot at Trump. “Donald Trump — he sees the world differently,” Walz said. “He doesn’t know the first thing about service — because he’s too busy serving himself.” The GOP messaging against Walz started almost immediately: Walz is a “West Coast wannabe,” the Trump campaign said in a statement, who is “obsessed with spreading California’s dangerously liberal agenda far and wide.” Trump’s running mate J.D. Vance quickly portrayed Walz as a “San Francisco-style liberal.” As each side scrambled Tuesday to define the largely unknown Minnesota governor in an ever-tightening presidential race, California and the Bay Area have, once again, become the bogeyman of presidential election politics, would-be examples of progressivism run amok. “Republicans have clearly discovered that California is a bad brand in the Midwest for Midwest voters,” said UC San Diego political science professor Thad Kousser. “So they’re trying to do everything they can to tie someone to this brand, as if Kamala Harris chose (Gov.) Gavin Newsom as her running mate.” (Newsom, for his part, sent out a press release Tuesday, describing Walz as “a brilliant choice” and seeking donations to their campaigns.) Among the finalists Harris considered for the vice president role — including Gov. Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania and U.S. Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona — Walz can be seen as the most liberal. He championed a free lunch program for all Minnesota students, was an early supporter of gay rights, and has championed tighter gun controls. Harris’ choice is a risk, said Dan Schnur who teaches political communications at UC Berkeley and USC. “Generally, when you have a more progressive candidate, you want to balance the ticket with someone more centrist,” Schnur said. “Harris has benefited over the last few weeks from this tremendous, tremendous enthusiasm and excitement from the Democratic base. They may be calculating that keeping that excitement going is their best bet.” California became a foil to Donald Trump in 2015, when he was running for president the first time and an undocumented immigrant killed a young San Francisco woman with a stolen gun. Trump assailed San Francisco’s “sanctuary city” policies. The city, as well as Pelosi, have become favorite GOP targets ever since. Some believe that Pelosi, who still represents San Francisco in Congress and recently published “The Art of Power,” may well have exerted her legendary influence over Harris’s selection. “Pelosi clearly has been a driver of this,” said Sonoma State Political Science Professor David McCuan. “She is someone who clearly is the political godmother of the vice president in a positive way, in a mature way, because she gives her the running room to make her own decisions.” Despite Trump’s characterization of Walz as spending his governorship “trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State,” Walz brings personal assets that tend to appeal to more moderate voters — the ones the Harris-Walz campaign will be taking to the swing states in the three months running up to the Nov. 5 election. Walz is the highest non-commissioned officer ever to serve in the U.S. House, he is an avid hunter and fisherman, a former history teacher and football coach. And ay 60, he’s a white middle-aged man. As U.S. Rep. Dean Phillips, the Minnesota Democrat who ran against Biden in the Democratic primaries, put it: “Tim Walz can fix a lawnmower, fire a cannon, and fiercely protect women’s freedoms. All in one day.” Lyndsey Schlax, a Democrat and history teacher from the East Bay city of Alameda, says that while she doesn’t agree with everything about Walz — or Harris for that matter — she is looking for a little levity in the presidential campaign that the ticket can bring. She’s been watching memes her friends sent her all morning. “There’s a lot of laughter. There’s a lot of jokes. There’s silliness. There’s all these pictures, like Walz holding a piglet and laughing his head off, or posting a picture of his cat being upset that the cat didn’t get Taylor Swift tickets,” Schlax, 43, said. “That so just taps into this kind of feeling of joy and hope.” But will any of it matter on election day in November? Vice presidential candidates rarely move the needle much, although there’s potential to lose voters if they mess up, like some suggest Vance has by denigrating women without children who love cats. “Really, what Kamala Harris did is a safe pick that she hopes solidifies her support in Minnesota and extends to places like Michigan and Wisconsin,” said Kousser from UC San Diego. “And if it just does that and doesn’t get her in trouble, that’ll be a successful VP pick.”","summary":"\"What Kamala Harris did is a safe pick,\" said political science professor Thad Kousser from UC San Diego.","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/08/06/harris-taps-down-the-middle-midwestern-running-mate-to-foil-gops-san-francisco-liberal-jabs/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/mn-logo-sm.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-06 23:59:11","author":"Julia Prodis Sulek","authors":["Julia Prodis Sulek"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.163},{"id":253538614,"title":"Harris and Walz campaign together for first time as White House ticket","text":"PHILADELPHIA - Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her newly selected vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov.

Now Walz is Harris's running mate","text":"Kamala Harris passed over senior Democrats from crucial battleground states to tap Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate. A process that usually requires months of careful vetting, Harris had just a few weeks to choose her vice-presidential nominee. Walz, 60, is not exactly a national figure in US politics. But he caught everyone's attention two weeks ago when he levelled a devastating, but simple, insult against Republican nominee Donald Trump – one that has since become a key campaign message for Democrats. Now he has just 90 days to convince American voters to put him and Harris in the White House. So who is Tim Walz? Here are nine fast facts about the governor. He's a Nebraska native who worked on the family farm Though Walz is the governor of the northern US state of Minnesota, he hails from Nebraska, further south. He grew up in the tiny town of Butte, which had a population of just a few hundred, and spent summers working on the family farm. At 17, he joined the military, following in his veteran father's footsteps. He then spent 24 years in the Army National Guard – the main combat reserve of the US Army. Helped by \"GI Bill\" benefits, which cover higher education costs for American service members, he studied to become a teacher. He taught social studies in high school before entering politics. While teaching in his native Nebraska, he met his wife, a fellow teacher from Minnesota. Soon after, they moved to Mankato, a Minnesota city of about 45,000 people, to be closer to her family. It's something of an unusual resume for a Democratic VP pick. The Washington Post reports he's the first one who didn't go to law school since 1964. But Democrats hope his rural and military background will help them win over moderate, middle-ground voters. They've already produced a campaign ad highlighting his country credentials. One of his first teaching stints was in China After graduating with a degree in social science education, Walz moved to China in 1989 – the year of its brutal Tiananmen Square massacre. According to a congressional biography, he was part of the \"first government-sanctioned groups of American educators to teach in China through a program at Harvard University\". In a 2016 interview with an agriculture publication, he said he'd been to China about 30 times. \"I don't fall into the category that China necessarily needs to be an adversarial relationship,\" he said in the interview. \"I totally disagree, and I think we need to stand firm on, what they're doing in the South China Sea, but there's many areas of cooperation that we can work on.\" An edited clip of that clip is now being shared on social media by some of Trump's supporters, but without mention of the year it was shot, and cut to remove his comment on the South China Sea. As a high school football coach, he championed gay rights While working as a teacher in Mankato in the 90s, Walz was a coach for the school's American football team. He helped to lead it to its first state championship. At the same time, he became the faculty adviser for the school's new gay-straight alliance. \"The fact that he took on that role while also being the football coach was so important,\" the school's first openly gay student told the Washington Post last week. \"He set an example not just for LGTBQ students but for football players in the locker room at a time when gay people were not well understood.\" He defied the odds to win a conservative-leaning Congressional district Before he was elected Minnesota governor, Walz was a member of the national Congress, representing the state's first congressional district. He defeated the Republican incumbent, who had held the district for 12 years, in 2007. But when he quit Congress to become governor in 2019, the Republicans won it back. It's a mostly rural district with a mostly Republican history, and Walz's success in winning it – and holding onto it for so long – is seen as evidence of his appeal to more conservative country voters. He's a gun owner and pheasant hunter once favoured by the NRA Walz has sought to portray himself as both pro-gun and pro-gun control. In an interview with CNN last week, for example, he compared his shooting credentials with those of his now-opponent in the VP race. \"JD Vance's schtick is talking about guns,\" he said. \"I guarantee you he can't shoot pheasants like I can.\" The powerful National Rifle Association (NRA), one of America's most influential lobby groups, endorsed him while he was in Congress. In 2016, he featured in the top 20 politicians for gun owners in popular shooters' magazine Guns & Ammo. But he fell out of favour with the gun lobby while campaigning to be Minnesota governor in 2018. After a mass shooting at a Florida school that year, he came out in support of a ban on assault weapons. More recently, he's signed gun control measures into state law. They include compulsory background checks for gun owners, and \"red flag laws\" that allow authorities to seize guns from people deemed to be a threat to themselves or others. \"As a veteran, gun owner, hunter and dad, I know basic gun safety isn't a threat to the Second Amendment – it’s about keeping our kids safe,\" he said last year. He was criticised over his handling of the George Floyd protests The murder of George Floyd by a police officer in 2020 led to protests in Minneapolis, the largest city in Minnesota. Some turned into violent riots. According to a state senate report, more than 1,500 businesses and buildings were vandalised and burned, causing $US500 million ($766 million) in property damage. As governor, Walz has been criticised for not acting sooner to bring rioting in the city centre under control. Critics say his decision to wait several days before activating the Minnesota National Guard was a grave error. The report, published by the Republican-controlled state senate, said Walz and the local mayor \"failed to realise the seriousness of the riots and the danger to Minnesotans if rioters were not confronted and stopped\". It also says they \"failed to act in a timely manner to confront rioters with necessary force due to an ill-conceived philosophical belief that such an action would exacerbate the rioting\". After Harris chose Walz as her VP running mate, his Republican opponent JD Vance said: \"They make an interesting tag team, because of course Tim Walz allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020, and then the few who got caught, Kamala Harris helped bail them out of jail.\" (Harris tweeted a link to the 'Minnesota Freedom Fund' to raise money for protesters in Minnesota at the time.) Walz told a recent press conference: \"Decisions were made in a situation, that is what it is, and I said we believed we tried to do the best that we can in each of those.\" He came up with what quickly became the Democrats' favourite insult Walz is not a household name outside of Minnesota. But he won some fame when he began describing some Republicans as \"weird\" during recent media interviews. \"These guys are just weird,\" he told MSNBC. \"They're running for He-Man Woman-Haters Club or something.\" It was seen as a shift from the Democrats' usual attack lines, which tend to focus on Trump as a convicted criminal and a threat to democracy. But it's been widely shared on social media, and it has since stuck. In the past couple of weeks, many Democrats have been hammering the \"weirdness\" of their Republican opponents. And Walz is sticking with it too. \"These guys are creepy and, yes, just weird as hell,\" he told his first campaign rally with Harris. Republicans call him a 'radical leftist' and 'West Coast wannabe' In announcing Walz as her pick, Harris pointed to his record on hot-button issues like gun control and abortion rights. The Trump campaign is pointing to his progressive record too. \"It’s no surprise that San Francisco liberal Kamala Harris wants West Coast wannabe Tim Walz as her running-mate,\" the campaign said. \"Walz has spent his governorship trying to reshape Minnesota in the image of the Golden State. \"From proposing his own carbon-free agenda to suggesting stricter emission standards for gas-powered cars, and embracing policies to allow convicted felons to vote, Walz is obsessed with spreading California’s dangerously liberal agenda far and wide.\" Trump himself later posted to social media: \"This is the most Radical Left duo in American history. There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again.\" He beat out VP contenders from more crucial battlegrounds Harris reportedly started with a shortlist of about a dozen potential running mates. In recent days, it appeared to have narrowed to three. The other two were from critical swing states: senator Mark Kelly from Arizona, and Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro. Both are popular locally and could have given Harris an edge in their respective states, which are likely to come down to the wire. But Harris chose Walz, despite the fact Minnesota is already a relatively reliably Democratic-voting state in national elections. Citing \"three people familiar with the vice-president's thinking\", the New York Times reports that Walz \"leapfrogged better-known contenders in part because Ms Harris viewed him as an Everyman figure from Minnesota whose Midwestern-dad-vibe balanced out her Bay Area background\". Harris and Walz are now embarking on a tour of the swing states, starting in Pennsylvania, where they've appeared together at their first rally. \"Thank you, Madam Vice-President, for the trust you put in me,\" Walz said to Harris on stage. \"But maybe more so, thank you for bringing back the joy.\" Loading...","summary":"Only a few weeks ago, many Americans outside Minnesota had never heard of Tim Walz.

Vance and his ‘couch’ during his first appearance as Kamala Harris’ VP selection: Vice President nominee refers to Republicans as ‘strange’ while audience shouts ‘lock him up’ for Trump","text":"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz made his debut as Kamala Harris running mate where he gave a first introduction of himself to the American people but also went after Donald Trump as a criminal, made a dig about J.D. Vance on a couch and called the GOP ticket weird. The 60-year-old’s first campaign remarks came at a massive first rally in Philadelphia just hours after he was dramatically revealed as the Democratic vice presidential pick. Thousands of people packed the Liacouras Center at Temple University for the boisterous event. The crowd went wild as Harris and Walz entered the arena together. ‘I couldn’t be prouder to be on this ticket, and to help make Kamala Harris the next President of the United States!’ Walz said. The announcement Tuesday ended weeks of speculation over who Harris would pick after President Biden exited the race on July 21 launching a massive shake-up at the top of the Democratic ticket. Walz is just introducing himself on the national stage. The Minnesota governor was elected in 2019 after serving on Congress since 2007. He also served 24 years in the National Guard and was a social studies teacher and football coach before running for Congress. ‘Minnesota’s strength comes from our values – our commitment to working together, to seeing past our differences, to lending a helping hand,’ Walz said. Walz also gave a preview of how he will go after Republicans on the campaign trail. He said Trump ‘doesn’t know the first thing about service because he’s too busy serving himself’ and claimed violent crimes were up under Trump stating that ‘doesn’t count the crimes he’s committed.’ Walz also slammed Vance saying he can’t wait to debate the Republican vice presidential nominee ‘if he’s willing to get off the couch and just show up.’ Walz called the Republican ticket ‘creepy’ and ‘just weird as hell.’ Harris spoke first after they took the stage and gave Walz a lengthy introduction. She touted his background as an educator. She said they come from different corners of the country but their values are the same. ‘He really shines a light on a brighter future that we can build together,’ Harris said. ‘In his state he has been a model chief executive and with his experience I am telling you Tim Walz will be ready on day one.’ It was also Harris’ first campaign rally and visit to the battleground state since becoming the official Democratic presidential nominee. ‘I’m now officially the democratic nominee’ she noted. ‘And so now that I have work to do, we need to move to the general election and win that.’ Another top contender for Harris’ running mate was Pennsylvania’s own Governor Josh Shapiro who was in attendance for the rally where he received a thunderous hero’s welcome from the crowd as he entered. Shapiro vowed to work his ‘tail off’ to elect Harris and Walz and said he loved being governor. He said he was focused on ‘GSD’ or ‘getting s**t done’ and heaped praise on Harris while blasting Trump and Vance. As the state’s governor went after the ex-president, the crowd started chanting ‘he’s a weirdo.’ Shapiro gave the credit to Walz. ‘Tim Walz is a great man,’ Shapiro said as the crowd went wild. ‘Tim Walz is a great patriot, and I’ll tell you what else, Tim Walz is a dear friend.’ Walz responded in kind with his own praise on Shapiro as a visionary leader. He mentioned they once attended a Bruce Springsteen concert together. Shapiro told the crowd he leans on his family and his faith and is ‘very proud’ of his faith. It came after some in the progressive wing of the Democratic party pushed back on Shapiro, who is Jewish, as a running mate over his strong support for Israel. As the progressive governor made his debut, multiple Democrats in attendance told DailyMail.com they admittedly knew very little if anything about him before the announcement was made but were excited. Several who had heard of Walz before said they only recently became aware of him as the governor known for calling Republicans ‘just weird.’ It has become a frequent line used by Democrats on the campaign trail. Democrats also claim his addition to the ticket helps with midwestern voters. Walz grew up in rural America and could help the party as rural America has become increasingly red over the years. ‘I was born in West Point, Nebraska and lived in Butte, a small town of 400 where community was a way of life,’ Walz said in Philadelphia. ‘Growing up, I spent summers working on the family farm. My mom and dad taught us to show generosity toward your neighbors and to work for the common good.’ The pick has been praised by Democratic lawmakers across the political spectrum from squad member New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, who is a registered Independent but still caucuses with the party. At the same time, Republicans have rushed to paint Walz as a ‘radical liberal’ who supports granting undocumented immigrants amnesty and supports sanctuary cities. The crowd for the rally began lining up early in the day as attendees decked out in Harris gear waited to get through security. People were handed bracelets that had lights flashing red, white and blue, making the event feel like a concert at times rather than a campaign rally. While Harris waited until late Tuesday morning to announce her running mate, the campaign came prepared with options. Throughout the arena were massive blue signs with ‘Harris Walz’ on them. Lanyards also included Walz’s name in addition to Harris. Those DailyMail.com spoke to said it was a historic occasion to be at her first event with her running mate, but others said they simply wanted to get a glimpse of the candidate they believe could become the first woman President of the United States. ‘We are just ecstatic about her candidacy and she’s going to win. There’s no question in my mind,’ said Betty Blue. ‘There’s been 46 presidents. Why not a woman? It’s time. With what’s going on in the country right now, we need a woman to bring the country together.’ ‘My generation, I see how much we tend to support her,’ said 14-year-old Addison Avat who was there with her mom. ‘She thinks about the future in a good way, and she wants to lift the future up.’ From Philadelphia, Harris and Walz are headed out on a battleground state tour across the country ending in Nevada on Saturday.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nMinnesota Governor Tim Walz made his debut as Kamala Harris running mate&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Tim Walz makes lighthearted remark about J.D.

Tim Walz was working to portray Donald Trump and Republicans to the American public as “just weird.” “These are weird people on the other side. They want to take books away. They want to be in your exam room,” Walz said in a TV interview last month. The message started with news interviews and eventually spread like wildfire across social media with the help of young Americans. The simple terminology of labeling the other side as “weird” or “odd” is not revolutionary or sophisticated in American politics but represents a new framing for Democrats who have spent the last eight years trying to defeat Trump and Trumpism by personifying him as the greatest threat to democracy. Walz went back to the reference at his first rally Tuesday with Vice President Kamala Harris, saying of Republicans: “These guys are creepy and yes, just weird as hell.” “The opposite of normalizing authoritarianism is to make it weird, to call it out and to sort of mock it,” Jennifer Mercieca, a historian at Texas A&M University, who wrote a book on Trump’s rhetoric, said. “To say, ‘Hey, that’s a weird thing you’re doing, calling your opposition enemies instead of saying that they’re good people who have different policy preferences.'” Now the party is turning the page with a new generation of candidates trying to appeal not just to Americans’ fears about what a second Trump presidency would mean, but to plainly label the policies and actions of the Republican party as abnormal. And Democrats see no more effective messenger to deliver this new attack than Walz, the 60-year-old Midwestern dad, who on Tuesday was chosen to become their vice presidential nominee. “Gov. Walz can do the job, and helps reinforce that we’re team normal,” freshman Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman of Ohio said in a statement Tuesday. “We’re pragmatic, reliable and bipartisan.” Walz’s ability to speak in layman’s terms about policy and politics coupled with his knowledge of the internet zeitgeist has helped propel the little-known politician to the national stage and on the “For You” social media pages of millions of Gen Z voters whose support will be crucial for Democrats come November. Labeled “the cool dad” online, news that Walz would be the Democratic running mate ignited a stream of online memes, including one with the caption, “To the window to the Walz,” a reference to the hit 2003 rap song “Get Low” by Lil Jon and the East Side Boyz. On TikTok, users created 60-second montages of Walz talking about the phenomenon of the new Charli XCX album Brat, which he says his young daughter helped explain to him, mixed with footage of him lambasting GOP vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance for his comments on “childless cat ladies.” “Go ahead and continue to denigrate people. Go ahead. My God, they went after cat people. Good luck with that,” Walz says in a MSNBC clip that has more than 150,000 likes on TikTok. “Turn on the internet. See what cat people do when you go after them.” But the same qualities that led Walz to the Democratic ticket are already being used against him by Republicans who have just in the last few hours labeled him as “weird” and “radical.” Trump sent a fundraising email Tuesday calling Walz “Dangerously Liberal” and saying he would “unleash HELL ON EARTH.” But Walz’s legislative record on issues like protecting abortion rights, legalizing recreational marijuana and restricting gun access have helped him gain popularity with young voters beyond his own solidly blue state to communities across the country. Voters of Tomorrow, a Gen Z-led organization that represents young political activists and voters, threw its full support behind Walz after weeks of campaigning on his behalf, saying that he has “dedicated his life to educating and empowering young people as a teacher and public servant.” “Governor Walz gets bonus points for articulating exactly how young Americans feel about Donald Trump and JD Vance: They are weird,” Santiago Mayer, the group’s executive director, said in a statement. “Trump and Vance are weirdly fixated on taking away freedoms from Americans and weirdly obsessed with culture wars.”","summary":"Now the party is turning the page with a new generation of candidates trying to appeal not just to Americans' fears about what a second Trump presidency would mean, but to plainly label the policies and actions of the Republican party as abnormal.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2024/08/06/how-tim-walz-became-beloved-by-young-voters-with-a-message-that-the-gop-is-weird/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TCFallback.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-06 23:45:52","author":"Farnoush Amiri","authors":["Farnoush Amiri"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.025},{"id":253538316,"title":"Social Media Revels in Tim Walz’s Varied Musical References, From Beyoncé and Taylor Swift to Prince and Bob Dylan","text":"Earlier on Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov.

Steve Martin has been deemed the perfect person to portray Kamala Harris’ recently-announced VP pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on “Saturday Night Live” this fall. On Tuesday, Walz, 60, was revealed as Harris’ running mate, and social media instantly buzzed over Martin and Walz’s physical resemblances. Fans said on X (formerly Twitter) that they want to see Martin, 78, portray the Democratic politician on the upcoming 50th season of “SNL,” which will be in production through the 2024 presidential election. “SNL get Steve Martin on the phone NOW,” read one tweet with over 9,000 retweets. “So Steve Martin is definitely gonna play Walz on SNL right,” said another fan. Someone else wrote, “He’s the only logical choice for this, can we get him to do it?” A fourth fan joked, “Am I missing something or did Kamala Harris not choose comedian Steve Martin to be her running mate?” Another fan pointed out that the similarities between Walz’s home in Minnesota and the house from Martin’s 1991 movie “Father of the Bride.” “Not only does Tim Walz look like Steve Martin, his house looks like the Father of the Bride House,” the fan tweeted with pictures of the two houses. The Post has reached out to reps for Martin and “SNL” for comment. Martin has hosted “SNL” 16 times — just one short of Alec Baldwin’s record of 17 hosting appearances. The last time Martin hosted the show was in December 2022 during Season 48. He co-hosted the episode with his “Only Murders in the Building” co-star Martin Short. Brandi Carlile was the musical guest. Martin’s first appearance as host was during Season 2 in 1976. It’s already been announced that Maya Rudolph will return as Harris, 59, for “SNL” Season 50. Rudolph, 52, first played Harris, the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, on the Dec. 21, 2019, episode of “SNL” hosted by Eddie Murphy. She won the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series for the role. Deadline reported that pre-production on Season 3 of Rudolph’s Apple TV+ series “Loot” was paused due to scheduling reasons — likely because of Rudolph’s commitment to “SNL.” The upcoming milestone season of the NBC sketch comedy series premieres on Sept. 28. Harris picked Walz as her running mate on Tuesday, setting the stage for their showdown with Donald Trump and his VP pick JD Vance in November. “I am proud to announce that I’ve asked Tim Walz to be my running mate. As a governor, a coach, a teacher, and a veteran, he’s delivered for working families like his,” the vice president posted on X. Walz called it the “honor of a lifetime” to join the Harris campaign — declaring, “I’m all in.” “Vice President Harris is showing us the politics of what’s possible. It reminds me a bit of the first day of school. So, let’s get this done, folks!” Walz said in a statement. Walz spent 24 years in the Army National Guard and then a decade in the US House of Representatives, serving a largely rural district in southern Minnesota, before running for governor in 2018.","summary":"The \"Only Murders in the Building\" star is social media's top choice to play Kamala Harris' running mate on Season 50 of \"SNL.\"","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/06/entertainment/steve-martin-top-pick-to-play-kamala-harris-vp-tim-walz-on-snl/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/2024-g-democratic-governors-offered-87152243.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/bi8A1Z3g-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-06 23:44:44","author":"Eric Todisco","authors":["Eric Todisco"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.055},{"id":253537852,"title":"Trump Posts Fan Fiction About Biden Stealing Nomination Back From Harris","text":"Donald Trump has taken his obsession with crafting falsehoods about Democratic nominee Kamala Harris to the the next level, penning his own fan fiction on Tuesday about the vice president. In a rant rife with misspellings and baseless conspiracy, Trump wrote: “What are the chances that Crooked Joe Biden, the WORST President in the history of the U.S., whose Presidency was Unconstitutionally STOLEN from him by Kamabla, Barrack HUSSEIN Obama, Crazy Nancy Pelosi, Shifty Adam Schiff, Cryin’ Chuck Schumer, and others on the Lunatic Left, CRASHES the Democrat National Convention and tries to take back the Nomination.” The ex-president continued, “He feels that he made a historically tragic mistake by handing over the U.S. Presidency, a COUP, to the people in the World he most hates, and he wants it back, NOW!!!” Despite Trump’s attempt to sow doubt (and boost morale within the GOP), President Joe Biden has publicly and fully endorsed Harris, and has urged the Democratic party to “come together and beat Trump.” Following the president’s decision to no longer run for reelection, the Democratic party swiftly rallied behind the vice president — from lawmakers to celebrities pledging their support for her presidential ticket in the 2024 election. Trump, on the other hand, has responded by having a verifiable meltdown over the prospect of facing her instead of Biden — backing out of a scheduled Sept. 10 debate, and proposing a televised face-off against the vice president, but on on his preferred network, Fox News, instead. Since then, Trump and his allies have struggled to find a line of attack against Harris, and have thrown a variety of sexist and racist insults at the vice president, from claiming she’s a “DEI hire” to slamming her for not having biological children. Meanwhile, Trump and his vice presidential pick, J.D. Vance, have been blasted as “weird” and “creepy” — part of the Democrats’ rhetorical strategy of lambasting the duo over their attempts to take away reproductive health care, and civil and LGBTQ+ rights. Of course, the former president’s recent fantasy scenario about the vice president only makes things weirder. As Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, summed it up during their debut as the Democratic ticket during a fired-up rally in Philadelphia Tuesday, Trump and his allies are “creepy and weird, yes, weird as hell.”","summary":"The former president posted a bizarre fantasy scenario on Truth Social","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-posts-fan-fiction-biden-harris-nomination-1235075162/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/trump-biden-harris-nomination.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-06 23:44:29","author":"Charisma Madarang","authors":["Charisma Madarang"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.449},{"id":253537862,"title":"Democrats turn to influencers to help share their message on social media","text":"As social media feeds have become key battlegrounds in the race for the White House, Democrats are deploying a fleet of influencers to try to win over voters online.

And if we're not, we're missing a huge way that voters are getting information about the world,\" said Rob Flaherty, who ran digital strategy in the Biden White House and now for the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris.He called the highly meme-able Harris a massive asset as the campaign reaches out to thousands of influencers.'We give them talking points, resources, base language, you know, graphics that they could repurpose or lift,\" he said of their campaign's work with influencers.And while Flaherty said the Harris campaign does not pay influencers directly, CBS News found a constellation of other Democratic political organizations that do.In May, Future Forward — the super PAC supporting Harris — hosted panels like Gaming The Algorithm and How Advocacy Can Benefit Your Business. A spokesperson for the PAC did not respond to a request for comment. Sanneh said she was hired last month by Protect Our Care, a progressive advocacy group that relies on anonymous donors. She made a video warning about Trump's second term agenda that she says the group helped her script.She said she takes their talking points and puts them in her own voice, saying she always discloses when she's being paid.While Sanneh would not say how much she's being paid, she did note, \"A video just for a creator in my size, an average can go from $3,000 to $10,000 and upwards.\"When it comes to hawking commercial products or sharing financial advice, federal rules require influencers to disclose when they are being paid. But in a rulemaking last December, the Federal Election Commission voted against similar requirements for influencers spreading political messaging. Sam Woolley, the incoming Chair of Disinformation Studies at the University of Pittsburgh, says using influencers is \"a bid by campaigns to create authenticity at a small scale.\"But he also noted that if people notice \"multiple influencers spreading the same exact message, you can start to realize like, 'hmm, some kind of coordination is going on.'\"For Sanneh, her next stop is the Democratic National Convention, where she and other influencers have been invited to make more content\"They just told us that if we wanted to put on our own show that they would give us all the resources to do that,\" Sanneh said.When asked if she felt the Democrats were rolling out the red carpet for her and other influencers, she told CBS News, \"Definitely, and I'm glad to be on it.\"","summary":"Democrats have deployed a fleet of influencers to try to win over voters online while the right has been mobilizing influencers for years.","url":"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/influencer-social-media-politics/","image":"https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/08/06/478fb4a6-9d59-4b87-b2be-a702d406b813/thumbnail/1200x630/724c294e4f90fd201050ddce859253f7/1722985388042.png?v=33116e4d892fab6878b5c06299369826","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-06 23:41:49","author":"Jo Ling Kent","authors":["Jo Ling Kent"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.09},{"id":253538522,"title":"Georgia election board says counties can do more to investigate election results","text":"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia’s State Election Board voted Tuesday to require county election officials to make a “reasonable inquiry” before certifying election results to the state, signaling that fights about approving election results could intensify this November in the South’s premier battleground state. Supporters say the measure is needed because members of county election boards must swear statements that results are accurate and need to be able to adequately assure themselves that the totals are correct before doing so. “Why one would not want to assume there is some oversight?” asked State Election Board member Janice Johnston, who was appointed the panel by the state Republican Party. “It’s the duty of the board to provide some oversight, in a fair way, in a reasonable way.” But opponents of the rule say it’s an invitation to create post-election chaos and that the board is defying state law that says that county officials “shall certify” results, as well as more than a century of court precedent finding county officials have little wiggle room on the issue. ”The proposed rule changes will give authority to local election officials to halt the counting of votes and slow down, or even outright refuse certification if they contend there are any irregularities, essentially making the certification of election results discretionary,” said House Minority Whip Sam Park, a Democrat from Lawrenceville. “The key word there is discretionary. This would essentially give partisan county board of elections personal control over Georgia’s election results, allowing them to uphold certifying the election if they disagree with the results.” The rule will take effect after 20 days, although it could be challenged in court. It’s yet another battle over what had long been an administrative afterthought, state and local boards certifying the results. With 90 days left in the presidential campaign, there could be more fighting in narrowly divided swing states. Former President Donald Trump and his allies have tried to block certification to stop election results from being made final if they lose. In 2020, two Republicans on Michigan’s state board of canvassers, which must certify ballot totals before state officials can declare a winner, briefly balked at signing off before one relented and became the decisive vote. Trump had cheered the delay as part of his push to overturn his loss that ultimately culminated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. During the 2022 midterms, some conservative, rural counties tried to hold up their state election results, citing the same debunked claims of voter fraud that Trump has made. In Georgia, state officials had to order rural Coffee County to certify in 2020. In May Republican-appointed Fulton County election board member Julie Adams refused to certify primary election results after she filed a lawsuit backed by the Trump-aligned America First Policy Institute that argues county election board members have the discretion to reject certification. The rule the board adopted Tuesday was proposed by Michael Heekin, the other Republican-appointed member of the Fulton County board. Heekin on Tuesday rebutted claims that reasonable is a subjective term, saying it has an established legal meaning. “It’s guardrails to make the point that what we are doing is very important and it’s not to be taken lightly,” Heekin told the state board. But Democrats and voting rights groups fear that Republicans on the board are laying the groundwork for Trump to dispute a Kamala Harris victory in Georgia. “I’m saying that adopting a rule that’s inconsistent with the statute and over 100 years of Georgia Supreme Court precedent is outside the authority of the board,” said Nikhel Sus, a lawyer for Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal-leaning group that focuses on government ethics and accountability. Tuesday’s action comes after a trio of Republican partisans aligned with Trump took control of the five-member regulatory board. It has no direct role in determining election results, but writes rules to ensure that elections run smoothly and hears complaints about violations. Trump himself praised those members during a rally in Atlanta on Saturday, saying the three “are all pit bulls fighting for honesty, transparency and victory,” but criticizing the Democrat on the board and the nonpartisan chairman appointed by Gov. Brian Kemp, saying they “aren’t so good.” Trump in particular singled out Johnston, a retired obstetrician and frequent critic of elections in deeply Democratic Fulton County, who was in the second row at Saturday’s rally and stood to acknowledge Trump’s praise. “My courage was contagious?” Trump said after Johnston stood. “Well, your courage is contagious, too.” Critics of the board’s entanglement with Trump and Republican Party politics argue that it’s not just unseemly, but may be violating the board’s own code of conduct, which says members of the board “shall be honest, fair, and avoid any appearance of conflict and/or impropriety.” Board member Janelle King, whose appointment cemented control to the Trump-aligned faction, denied that she’s unduly influenced by her party. State Republican Party Chairman Josh McKoon recently emailed proposed rules and talking points to the third member of the faction, former state Sen. Rick Jeffares. “I don’t make decisions based on what side of the aisle wants me to do something,” King told reporters. “I look at the facts, I look at the evidence, I look at what’s in front of me, and I see if this is a good rule.” Jeff Amy, The Associated Press","summary":"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia&#8217;s State Election Board voted Tuesday to require county election officials to make a “reasonable inquiry” before certifying election results to the state, signaling that fights about approving election results could intensify this November in the South&#8217;s premier battleground state.

Ms. Harris, a California Democrat, has never won an election as a solo candidate outside the liberal bastion of California, where races often hinge not on winning swing voters but on successfully navigating intraparty fights.

His state’s 19 votes in the Electoral College have long been critical for candidates trying to reach the necessary 270 to win. But the same things about Shapiro that appealed to moderates angered some on the left in his party: his support for a private school voucher program and natural gas infrastructure as well as particularly his support for Israel’s war in Gaza after Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack. Some Democrats lamented what they said was a missed opportunity by bypassing Shapiro. Republicans, meanwhile, tried to paint Harris’ choice as a snub to Jewish voters, a traditionally Democratic constituency that former President Donald Trump has tried to court in this year’s race. “Not only is he exceptionally smart and capable, but, in my opinion, he brought the math to the path of 270,” said Ryan Bizzarro, 38-year-old Democratic state lawmaker from Erie, Pennsylvania, said of Shapiro. Shapiro spoke at a rally in Philadelphia Tuesday night before the new Democratic ticket took the stage, with the Pennsylvania governor receiving big applause from thousands of attendees. “I love you Philly. You know what else I love, I love being your governor,” Shapiro said. He added, “I am going to continue pouring my heart and soul into continuing to serve you every single day as your governor.” Shapiro also praised Walz as a great man with strong midwestern values, calling him a friend he said he couldn’t wait for Pennsylvanians to get to know. Walz returned the compliment when he took the stage later with Harris in Philadelphia. “My God, what a treasure you have in Josh Shapiro,” he said. “Holy hell, can this guy bring the fire.” Philadelphia Mayor Cherelle Parker, who advocated fiercely but unsuccessfully for Shapiro, also spoke at the event and said Democrats should not let Republicans and detractors divide them over the pick. “Our Democratic nominee has spoken and that’s it. Period. End of story,” Parker said. Republicans try to take advantage of Shapiro not being picked A number of high-profile Republicans sought to seize on the liberal pushback Shapiro faced over his stance on Israel, suggesting Tuesday that Shapiro was not picked as Harris’ running mate because of antisemitic attitudes in the Democratic Party. Trump, the Republican nominee, has been sharply criticized for his record on antisemitism, notably his suggestion that there were “fine people on both sides” of an antisemitic march in Charlottesville, Virginia, and his dinner with white nationalist Nick Fuentes at his Mar-a-Lago residence in 2022. The former president recently suggested Harris “doesn’t like Jewish people” even though her husband, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, is Jewish, and seemed to agree with a radio host who called Emhoff “a crappy Jew.” Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice-presidential candidate, told reporters in Philadelphia on Tuesday that it seemed Harris didn’t pick Shapiro because Democrats feared “grassroots activists in their party wouldn’t take a Jewish nominee.” Michigan state Sen. Jeremy Moss, who is Jewish and was excited at the prospect of a Jewish vice president, praised Walz and criticized Republicans for framing her decision as a slight against Jewish Democrats. “I’ve seen the discourse on the right saying that there’s clearly no room for Jews in Democratic politics,” said Moss. “I defy any one of them to name a single Jewish Republican governor or a single Jewish Republican U.S. senator. They can’t, because there are none.” The last Jewish Republican senator was former Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota, who left office in 2009. Missouri’s former Republican Gov. Eric Greitens is Jewish, but he resigned in 2018. Arab American leaders who had publicly cautioned against picking Shapiro countered claims that the opposition was based on the governor’s Jewish background and said his positions on Israel and statements on campus protests went further than other candidates, particularly Walz. Abdullah Hammoud, the mayor of Dearborn, Michigan, noted that the Arab American community overwhelmingly voted for Jewish politicians in the past, backing former Democratic Rep. Andy Levin and twice supporting former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator. “It’s certainly not antisemitic to critique somebody’s position on Israeli policy,” Hammoud said. “That’s just called stewardship and accountability.” Most Jewish Americans vote Democratic and are still poised to rally around the Democratic ticket, even without Shapiro. Only 30% of Jewish voters supported Trump in 2020, while 69% supported Biden, according to AP VoteCast, a sweeping survey of the electorate. That made Jewish voters one of the religious groups where support for Biden was strongest. The Jewish Democratic Council of America, which held an online rally for Harris last week, issued a statement in support of Walz on Tuesday, calling him “an exceptional choice” and noting he and Harris “align with the vast majority of Jewish voters on every key issue, including Israel and antisemitism.” Shapiro remains a key Democratic asset for this year’s campaign Shapiro is a popular first-term governor who two years ago was elected in a battleground state that is seen as critical to Democrats’ path to win the White House. The 51-year-old emerged in recent days as a finalist on Harris’ speedy search for a running mate, winning fans in the party for his speaking style that evoked former President Barack Obama. With his background as a former state attorney general, like Harris, he also stood out for his forceful defenses of the White House and critiques of Trump. He is a staunch proponent of abortion rights but is also seen as a moderate on energy policy, a significant issue in his natural gas producing state. Shapiro has professed solidarity with Israel in its campaign to eliminate Hamas and has aggressively confronted what he saw as antisemitism appearing at pro-Palestinian demonstrations. In recent days, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported on a column he wrote for his college newspaper saying Palestinians were “too battle-minded” to coexist with Israel. Jonathan Sarna, professor of American Jewish history at Brandeis University in Waltham, Massachusetts, said that as the opposition to Shapiro over his position on Israel became more vocal, “suddenly this decision took on new significance.” Nathan Diament, the executive director of public policy for the Orthodox Union, an umbrella group of Orthodox Jews in the U.S., said “It’s a bit disappointing” a Jewish candidate won’t be on the ticket. “Certainly, it would have been exciting if that had happened for a second time,” he said, referencing Joseph Lieberman’s run with Al Gore in 2000. Amy Spitalnick, the CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, said in a post on X that it was “ridiculous” for people to claim Harris, whom she noted was married to a Jewish man, second gentleman Doug Emhoff, didn’t pick Shapiro because of antisemitism. “There are two crowds using Jews as political footballs here: The far-left that singled out Shapiro (despite Israel policies largely aligned with Walz and others) AND the swarm of right-wingers now claiming Harris/Dems are antisemitic,” she wrote. “Neither is credible.” State Sen. Sharif Street of Philadelphia said that Walz’s values, including on abortion and gun control, align more with Philadelphians than those of Vance or Trump. And he believes his retail political skills will help carry the state, even without Shapiro on the ticket. “Look, Gov. Shapiro’s a rockstar in this state. People love him,” said Street, Pennsylvania’s Democratic Party chair and the son of former Mayor John Street. “But he will still be out there campaigning for this ticket. They haven’t lost Josh Shapiro.” ___ Associated Press reporters Tiffany Stanley in Washington, Peter Smith in Pittsburgh, Meg Kinnard and Will Weissert in Philadelphia and Joey Cappelletti in Lansing, Michigan, contributed to this report.","summary":"Most Jewish Americans vote Democratic and are still poised to rally around the Democratic ticket, even without Shapiro.","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/08/06/kamala-harris-vp-walz-shapiro-jewish/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2163853221-e1722986999542.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-06 23:31:37","author":"Maryclaire Dale,Michelle L.
