Meanwhile some states are preparing to comply with the unprecedented request which could be used to achieve Trump administration priorities, such as immigration enforcement.\n\nIn new guidance issued earlier this month, the USDA told states they must turn over data to the agency, through their third-party payment processors, \"including but not limited to\" names, birth dates, Social Security numbers and addresses of all applicants and recipients of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, going back more than five years. More than 40 million people rely on the assistance each month.\n\nThe guidance warns failure to make the data available \"may trigger noncompliance procedures,\" which can mean legal action and withholding funds.\n\nSNAP recipients, including some college students who are enrolled in the program, along with a privacy group and a national hunger group, sued in federal court in Washington, D.C. and are asking a federal judge to halt the data collection until the agency complies with protocols outlined in federal law.\n\nThe plaintiffs say that the USDA isn't following proper procedures for this kind of data collection effort, which include offering public notice, seeking public comment and publishing a privacy impact assessment ahead of time. For example, the Privacy Act requires a specific published notice, known as a Systems of Record Notice.\n\nThe USDA did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nEarlier this month, an unnamed spokesperson using a USDA press email account told NPR the intent of the data sharing guidance \"was to remove the data silos\" and to uphold President Trump's March 20 executive order titled, 'Stopping Waste, Fraud, and Abuse by Eliminating Information Silos.' The executive order calls for \"unfettered access to comprehensive data from all state programs that receive federal funding\" including from \"third-party databases.\"\n\nThe same email said the agency's office of general counsel \"is determining if this new data sharing guidance falls under an existing published System of Records Notice or if it requires its own published notice.\"\n\n\"All personally identifiable information will comply with all privacy laws and regulations and will follow responsible data handling requirements,\" the email said.\n\nThe Trump administration is aggressively collecting data\n\nThe legal fight over SNAP data comes the same day as Republicans in the House of Representatives passed a massive bill that includes deep cuts to SNAP. The ad-hoc Department of Government Efficiency is also merging data from across the federal government for purposes that include immigration enforcement and identifying fraud. DOGE's data collection efforts have been contested in several legal cases.\n\n\"This case is part of a pattern that we're seeing from the Trump administration of agencies reaching out and grabbing the personal data of Americans,\" said Madeline Wiseman, counsel at the National Student Legal Defense Network, which is representing plaintiffs in the lawsuit along with attorneys from Protect Democracy, Electronic Privacy Information Center and the National Center for Law and Economic Justice.\n\n\"We have no idea what the government's up to – who's going to have access to this data, for what purposes, and whether USDA is going to keep it internal or whether USDA is going to share it with other federal agencies for other purposes,\" said Wiseman.\n\nPrivacy experts warn that there would be huge implications if federal agencies are able to ignore privacy protections and compel states and private contractors to turn over sensitive data currently held only by states, as that could allow the federal government to create powerful surveillance tools.\n\nA former USDA official who worked in the agency's Food and Nutrition Service, which administers SNAP, underscored the unprecedented nature of the government's request.\n\n\"FNS has never had a nationwide list of everyone receiving SNAP benefits, let alone detailed personal information like their address or income,\" said the former official who asked to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to speak with the media at their current job.\n\nThe official said during the Biden administration, the agency \"intentionally designed its computer systems to not collect or store personally-identifiable information about people participating in nutrition programs, like SNAP and WIC, considering it too big of a risk to participant privacy and data security.\"\n\nResponses vary by state\n\nWhile some states have indicated they are weighing the legality of USDA's data demand, other states with Republican governors told NPR they intend to comply.\n\nIowa is \"working with our vendor to meet the request of the federal government,\" Alex Murphy, director of communications for the state's Department of Health and Human Services, told NPR in an email.\n\nOhio is \"in the process of complying with the request,\" Ohio Department of Job and Family Services spokesperson Tom Betti wrote in an email. \"It is a substantial amount of data and will take some time to compile.\" Betti added the data will be shared through Ohio's EBT payment processor, Conduent.\n\nThe Alaska Beacon reported that Alaska Department of Health spokesperson Alex Huseman said the state \"is complying with the federal government's requirement to share the information as requested.\" Huseman has not shared the same statement with NPR.\n\nLuke Elzinga, the board chair of the Iowa Hunger Coalition, told NPR that hunger advocates are already overwhelmed by proposed cuts to SNAP at a time when food pantries are facing historic demands in the state, and are now also concerned about the implications of the state sharing SNAP recipients' sensitive data.\n\n\"We're really worried that this could be used to target immigrant families,\" Elzinga told NPR. He said state agencies have worked hard to help immigrant households that are eligible for SNAP benefits feel confident in applying, but this new guidance will change that.\n\nWhile immigrants who lack legal status in the country are not eligible to receive SNAP and only some categories of legal immigrants qualify, parents can enroll their U.S. citizen children regardless of their own immigration status. The Trump administration has revoked legal protections for certain categories of immigrants, such as some groups with Temporary Protected Status. That means some SNAP recipients will become subject to deportation so having access to information about those recipients' addresses could be useful for federal authorities.\n\n\"If you're trying to design a public benefits program that supports the most vulnerable people and makes sure that nobody in our country goes hungry, this is obviously not the way to do it,\" said Ami Fields-Meyer, a senior fellow at the Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation at Harvard University specializing in the intersection between civil liberties and technology, and a former senior policy advisor to Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\n\"But if you're trying to integrate critical assistance into a machinery for hunting immigrants and breaking up families and deporting people without due process – this is exactly how you do it.\"\n\nStates and their vendors keep sensitive data on many federally-funded programs and benefits, such as for Unemployment Insurance, Medicaid, and special education. The attorneys behind the lawsuit warn the USDA's demand for SNAP data could set a dangerous precedent.\n\nStates could become \"the new battleground in the fight against DOGE's oversteps into the lives of Americans,\" said Nicole Schneidman, a technology policy strategist at Protect Democracy and one of the attorneys involved in the suit. \"This demand puts states in a no-win situation where they must break the law and betray their citizens or risk losing essential funding.\"\n\nAfter Maryland's payment processor, Conduent, informed the state's Department of Human Services about the USDA's request for SNAP data, the state agency sent a letter to its vendors, grantees, contractors and community partners asking them to forward any federal requests for data they might receive.\n\nThe letter says any personally identifiable information and protected health information, \"should be kept confidential and not shared, disclosed or accessed, except in accordance with the contract and applicable law.\"\n\nHave information you want to share about SNAP, DOGE access to government databases and immigration?

Most notably, Springsteen kept the two politically charged speeches the singer/songwriter spoke before performing “Land of Hope and Dreams” (2001) and “My City of Ruins” (2002). \n\nSpringsteen’s passionate comments include stating that America “is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration” and that “a majority of our elected representatives have failed to protect the American people from the abuses of an unfit president and a rogue government.” \n\nSpringsteen regularly releases live recordings on his website for fans to buy. Yet, the “Land of Hope & Dreams” EP marks the musician going further by adding the release to streaming services such as Spotify and ensuring his political statements are at the forefront. President Trump didn’t take too kindly to Springsteen’s critique from his May 14 concert, saying the musician was “dumb as a rock,” and a “dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker in a Truth Social post on May 16. The president also stated he would open up an investigation targeted at Springsteen, Beyonce, and Oprah with allegations they took money to endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris during her 2024 presidential run. \n\nOn Wednesday, the President posted a doctored video of himself hitting Bruce Springsteen with a golf ball. \n\nArtists such as Neil Young have come to Springsteen’s defense. In a post on his personal website on Tuesday, Young stated he “wasn’t scared” of the President and that he should “STOP THINKING ABOUT WHAT ROCKERS ARE SAYING. Think about saving America from the mess you made. Taylor Swift is right. So is Bruce.”\n\nRelated coverage:\n\nI’m now cancer-free, iconic punk singer tells fansLegendary guitarist says ‘no chance’ for band reunion after singer tried to fight him on stageTrump blasts Springsteen like never before: ‘Dumb as a rock,’ should ‘KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT’Springsteen blasts Trump yet again, calls him ‘incompetent and treasonous’ at concertPopular rock bands’ anniversary tour falls apart, singer catching the blameMusicians we ‘canceled’ are selling out N.J. concerts again.

Many feel their beliefs, which includes racist narratives and so-called Christian persecution, have become more normalized in government and mainstream discourse. In its annual Year in Hate and Extremism report, released Thursday, the Southern Poverty Law Center said it counted 1,371 hate and extremist groups, a 5 per cent decline. The nonprofit group attributes this to a lesser sense of urgency to organize because their beliefs have infiltrated politics, education and society in general. Some of the ways they have done this are through pushing for bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, book bans and protests of drag story hours, the report says.

These include groups who express views that are anti-LBGTQ+, anti-immigrant, antisemitic and anti-Muslim. This number has been steadily declining since reaching a historic high of 1,021 in 2018. “The trends have slightly sort of gone up and down but let's just say generally, since our tracking, have increased. And that's not just on a total numbers level but also on a per capita,” said Rachel Carroll Rivas, interim director of the SPLC's Intelligence Project. Also Read | US: Tennessee Inmate Oscar Smith Executed by Lethal Injection for Killing Estranged Wife, Her 2 Sons in 1989. The number of anti-government groups last year totaled 838, an increase from recent years, according to the law center based in Montgomery, Alabama, that tracks racism, xenophobia and far-right militias. These groups see the federal government as “tyrannical” and include militias and self-described sovereign citizens. Male supremacy also continues to emerge as an influential hate group. The SPLC documented seven new male supremacist hate groups, making the total 16. Their rhetoric espouses misogyny and strict gender roles. Their rising influence came during an election year when the country saw a woman of color be the first presidential nominee for a major political party. “I'm not sure it's a direct result of the candidacy of Kamala Harris,” Rivas said. However, SPLC researchers went into chatrooms of white supremacist organizations during the election and found “intense vilification, the claiming of demonization of Harris as well as just the pushing of the idea falsely that women would not be qualified.” Some people on the far right have also pushed a belief that white Christian culture is being threatened by a “demographic crisis” including fewer births. “Politicians, pundits and provocateurs on the right have turned toward demonic language to tar those who disagree with them,” the report states. Last year's report found “record numbers” of white nationalist and anti-LGBTQ groups in 2023. The analysis highlighted how far-right groups tried to waylay democracy through disinformation, false conspiracy theories and threats to election workers. It also examined how supporters of Christian supremacy used similar topics to organize a movement toward authoritarianism. The SPLC is a liberal advocacy organization that, besides monitoring hate groups, files lawsuits over justice issues and offers educational programs to counter prejudice. Frequently criticized by conservatives as biased, the nonprofit has faced lawsuits for its designation of some organizations as hate groups. The report's release comes as a Los Angeles college professor made an appearance in front of media and supporters a few weeks after he was severely injured in a hit and run that he reported as a hate crime. He spoke at the Chinese American Museum in downtown Los Angeles. Aki Maehara, 71, was riding his electric bicycle in Montebello, 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles, on April 29 when he says he heard a driver yell a racial slur. Maehara says a car then struck him and the driver fled. He was hospitalized with a concussion, neck injury, cheek bone fracture and bruises and swelling up and down his body. Maehara, who is Japanese American, teaches a course on the history of racism in the U.S. at East Los Angeles College. He returned to the classroom last week, according to multiple outlets. The Montebello Police Department is investigating. Photos of his injuries posted to a GoFundMe page have been shared multiple times on social media with users calling for hate crime charges. The crowdsourcing campaign has raised almost USD 80,000 for Maehara as of Thursday.

Their business plan, shared with the Times, says the company will directly fund influencers and help produce their content. They will make a creator talent agency and make deals with “four flagship creators.”\n\nAnother effort in the works is called Project Bullhorn, which will also gather donations to support liberal content creators. The project, which aims to raise $35 million in its first year, was pitched to donors at a meeting this month, where Senator Cory Booker, D-N.J., was reportedly in attendance.\n\nOther projects seeking major donor funding include Channel Zero, a company which will provide administrative support to influencers with large followings, and Double Tap Democracy, which will collaborate with 2,000 apolitical influencers with smaller followings, the Times reported.\n\nThe report comes as Democrats face a messaging and identity crisis in the election aftermath, with polls showing the party’s favorability sinking to record lows this year. According to a Fox News national poll conducted in April, the favorability rating for the Democratic Party dropped to 41%.\n\nTrump dominated the podcast scene during the 2024 campaign, reaching millions of listeners in his interviews with popular influencers and comedians like Joe Rogan, Andrew Schulz and Theo Von.\n\nSome media outlets have reported that his online presence was instrumental in winning the election, particularly for younger male voters, who supported Trump at 53%, compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 45%, according to a Fox News Voter Survey last November.\n\nLast November, Rogan mocked Democrats for calling for a new version of him to help their party.\n\n“This is one thing that keeps coming up like, ‘We need our own Joe Rogan’ right?

After hitting a shot, the footage cuts to Springsteen on a stage, his back to the camera, being struck on the back with a digitally-imposed golf ball, and tripping over.\n\nThere was no caption accompanying the video.\n\nTrump’s latest dressing down of the storied musician came days after a late-night spout from America’s commander-in-chief.\n\nOn Monday, ahead of a meeting with Vladimir Putin, Trump took to Truth Social to share a rambling tirade directed at Springsteen and other Hollywood A-listers who endorsed his presidential opponent Kamala Harris.\n\n“HOW MUCH DID KAMALA HARRIS PAY BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN FOR HIS POOR PERFORMANCE DURING HER CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT?” Trump wrote, “WHY DID HE ACCEPT THAT MONEY IF HE IS SUCH A FAN OF HERS? ISN’T THAT A MAJOR AND ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION? WHAT ABOUT BEYONCÉ? … AND HOW MUCH WENT TO OPRAH, AND BONO???, ” he continued.\n\n“I am going to call for a major investigation into this matter. Candidates aren’t allowed to pay for ENDORSEMENTS, which is what Kamala did, under the guise of paying for entertainment,” he went on.\n\n“In addition, this was a very expensive and desperate effort to artificially build up her sparse crowds. IT’S NOT LEGAL! For these unpatriotic ‘entertainers,’ this was just a CORRUPT & UNLAWFUL way to capitalize on a broken system,” the president concluded.\n\nAbout eight hours later, he took to social media again.\n\n“According to news reports, Beyoncé was paid $11,000,000 to walk onto a stage, quickly ENDORSE KAMALA, and walk off to loud booing for never having performed, NOT EVEN ONE SONG!” Trump wrote.\n\n“Remember, the Democrats and Kamala illegally paid her millions of Dollars for doing nothing other than giving Kamala a full throated ENDORSEMENT.”\n\nTransitioning to full caps, the president rounded off his hours-long rant.\n\n“THIS IS AN ILLEGAL ELECTION SCAM AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL! IT IS AN ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION! BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN, OPRAH, BONO AND, PERHAPS, MANY OTHERS, HAVE A LOT OF EXPLAINING TO DO!!!,” he wrote.\n\nSpringsteen is one of Trump’s most high-profile and longstanding critics and was a vocal proponent of Kamal Harris during last year’s election campaign.\n\nDuring his concert on May 14, the all-American rock star said the president was ‘unfit‘ for office before galvanizing the crowd to stand up and fight for democracy.\n\nTrump fired back on Friday by hurling insults at Springsteen, saying he was “Highly Overrated” and “not a talented guy.”\n\n“I see that Highly Overrated Bruce Springsteen goes to a Foreign Country to speak badly about the President of the United States,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Never liked him, never liked his music, or his Radical Left Politics and, importantly, he’s not a talented guy,” the president wrote.\n\nHe accused Springsteen of being a “pushy, obnoxious JERK” and “dumb as a rock,” before fixating on his looks.\n\n“This dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied!) ought to KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT until he gets back into the Country,” the president wrote, appearing to threaten Springsteen with punishment upon his return to the U.S. after his tour.\n\nOn Tuesday, Canadian singer Neil Young chimed in on the feud, telling Trump to focus on “saving America from the mess you made” instead of feuding with celebrities who have criticized him.\n\nDuring his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album The Ghost of Tom Joad bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants — Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song American Skin (41 Shots), criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.\n\n— with files from Global News’ Michelle Butterfield, Katie Scott and The Associated Press","summary":"The clip shows Trump on a golf course teeing up.

CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson's new book, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" was released on Tuesday and has generated considerable publicity. It details Joe Biden's mental acuity concerns while in office, accusing the Biden White House of hiding the truth about his fitness for office. Tapper and Thompson retained the crisis management firm Heller to help handle public relations for the book — which has generated significant coverage and criticism — and interested reporters have been directed to send questions to Heller senior vice president Nate Evans, a veteran Democratic communications aide. TAPPER ADMITS FEELING 'HUMILITY' ABOUT PAST BIDEN COVERAGE AS LIBERALS DISPARAGE NEW BOOK Evans, who joined Heller after Biden left office five months ago, spent nearly three years working at a New York-based role for the State Department during Biden’s presidency, according to his LinkedIn. Before that, Evans served as a senior White House communications advisor to Vice President Kamala Harris from September through December 2024 after she replaced Biden as the Democratic nominee. He also held various roles in Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s, D-Minn., office, and he served as a communications director for the Biden campaign in Wisconsin in 2020, according to his LinkedIn page. The roles Evans occupied would have \"little-to-no face time\" with Biden, a source familiar with Biden administration staffing told Fox News Digital. FLASHBACK: KARINE JEAN-PIERRE DECLARED THERE IS 'NO COVER-UP' OF BIDEN'S HEALTH AFTER HE DROPPED OUT OF RACE He also worked for Harris' first presidential campaign in 2019, worked on Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign and also served in the Obama White House. Evans’ personal X account noted that he was a spokesperson for both Harris and Biden until Thursday afternoon. The bio section was scrubbed shortly after Fox News Digital inquired about his past work. Evans did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Risa Heller, the founder and CEO of the firm, previously served as communications director for Senator Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., from 2005 to 2007, according to her LinkedIn. The book features startling behind-the-scenes coverage of Biden's mental decline in office that worried many Democrats who failed to speak out at the time. Conservatives, however, have pilloried the book as coming too late to the same conclusion they did before Biden's debate performance laid bare his cognitive deficiencies. FORMER BIDEN MEDICAL ADVISOR SAYS HE 'PROBABLY' HAD CANCER AT BEGINNING OF PRESIDENCY Tapper has acknowledged \"humility\" about his past coverage of Biden during multiple stops on his promotional book tour. \"I think some of the criticism is fair, to be honest,\" Tapper told CNN last week as he was pressed on the criticisms of himself and the book. \"Of me, certainly. I’m not going to speak for anybody else, but knowing then what I know now, I look back at my coverage during the Biden years — and I did cover some of these issues, but not enough. I look back on it with humility.\" Tapper declined to comment on the record, while Thompson didn't respond to a request for comment.

I had one conversation with someone, this was after the election, while we were reporting this book, and this person said, \"Listen, yes, we deserve blame for X, Y, Z. We were hiding him. We were.\" But this person also sort of got in my face, and they said, \"Listen, the media deserves some blame, too.\" Like we were sort of amazed at some of the stuff we were able to spin and get on…. They're just like, \"You guys should not have believed us so easily.\" And I thought that was like a really interesting, but I also think that's true. I think the media, and in a lot of ways, was not skeptical enough and did not remember the less that, they do it to different degrees, but every White House lies.\n\nThis reminds me of the essay I prepared for the Free Speech in Crisis & the Limits of the First Amendment in March; I was invited to participate on the Media Environment panel, for which the description was:\n\nIt is widely believed that a profoundly broken media system is responsible for bringing the current administration into power, and for critics, the political crisis it has unleashed. Is this correct? And if so, what is to be done about it? How can public opinion be harnessed to serve constitutional purposes in the new media landscape? How can and should the media system be reformed? And what can free speech law do about any of this?\n\nWe were all asked to write up to about 2000 words on our topics, and I include below the current draft of my submission (a version of which I blogged March 31). I hope to revise it, if there's time before the essays are published at Balkinization, to include part of Thompson's quotes, and to cite Original Sin.\n\nThe 2024 presidential campaign saw a massive disinformation and misinformation campaign, which likely helped bring the current administration into power. Leading media organizations failed to stop it in time. Indeed, some of them were complicit, through inadequate investigation and perhaps even willful blindness, in the misinformation. We thus face an urgent question, raised by the workshop organizers: \"How can and should the media system be reformed?\"\n\nI'm speaking, of course, of the campaign to conceal President Biden's mental decline—a campaign that was only conclusively exposed by the June 27, 2024 debate. At that point, little time was left for deciding whether the President should be persuaded to step aside; for the actual persuasion; for the selection of a replacement; and for the replacement's attempt to persuade the people to elect her.\n\nHad the Administration leveled with the public earlier, or had the media exposed the concealment earlier, there would likely have been time for a full primary campaign, in which Democratic voters could have made their choice about whom to run against Donald Trump.[1] Perhaps that candidate would have been more effective than Kamala Harris. Or perhaps the candidate would have still been Harris, but a Harris who was seen as having more legitimacy with the public. \"Democracy Dies in Darkness,\" the Washington Post tells us. It appears that the Democratic Party's prospects died in this particular darkness.\n\nThe single most consequential fact of the 2024 Presidential campaign had thus been largely hidden for a long time, including from (and, perhaps unwittingly, by) the media organizations whose job it is to inform us. Indeed, this a fact not just of immense political significance, but also central to national security: If President Biden was indeed cognitively impaired, that bore on his ability to make decisions as President, not just his ability to be re-elected.\n\nWhen, for instance, Trump and Vance spread unfounded rumors of Haitian immigrants eating cats and dogs, the media rightly blew the whistle. But when some media outlets tried to point out the evidence of Biden's likely incapacity, others didn't pick up on the investigation—and, indeed, sometimes pooh-poohed the investigation.\n\nAs late as mid-June 2024, the White House and many of its supporters characterized videos of Biden apparently freezing up and seeming confused as \"cheap fake\" disinformation created by his enemies.[2] Indeed, as Nate Silver has noted, \"some coverage endorsed the White House party line, particularly in its tendency to characterize claims about Biden's acuity as 'misinformation.'\"[3] Only Biden's televised debate performance on June 27, 2024 made it impossible to deny there was something badly wrong. It seems likely that many of the supposed \"cheap fakes\" actually accurately captured Biden's cognitive slippage, especially since the slippage apparently went back a good deal before the debate.[4]\n\nAnd even if some particular videos had indeed been disinformation from his enemies, the fact remains that the media failed to adequately identify the disinformation from his friends. Indeed, isn't it shocking that so many White House reporters appear to have learned thanks only to the nationally televised debate and not to their investigative journalism?\n\nOf course, reaching the truth on this question wasn't easy. Biden insiders apparently tried hard to conceal the facts (that's the disinformation part). And indeed it's not surprising that people who are both personally loyal to a President and rely on the President's success for their ongoing careers would want to conceal such facts. In our fallen world, we can't expect much candor from political insiders. And I expect most journalists sincerely believed the reassurances they were getting from the insiders.\n\nBut getting sincerely duped isn't a great professional mark for a journalist.[5] Their job was to dig and find out—before things became evident, not after (and indeed some indications of Biden's decline were indeed evident for some time before the debate[6]). Indeed, to the extent that the media's credibility has declined over recent years, such failures of investigation seem likely to only exacerbate this decline.\n\nUndoubtedly, the White House wanted to keep this fact [of Biden's decline] under wraps until Biden was safely over the finish line in November. But media organizations that participated, even unwittingly, in this farce have not only made a subsequent Democratic administration far less likely—they have profoundly undermined their own integrity.[7]\n\nHow could this happen? I hope we will learn more about this in the years to come. A CNN headline the day I wrote this discussed a forthcoming book by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson called \"Original Sin: President Biden's Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again.\"[8]\n\nBut at this point, at least a first cut—informed by our shared knowledge of human nature—is that many in the media likely didn't dig hard because they didn't really wanted to uncover things.[9] It isn't controversial, I think, that most in the mainstream media much preferred President Biden over his challenger, Donald Trump.[10] Indeed, I agree they had good reason to dislike Trump. Certainly Trump himself had done much to stoke that hostility.\n\n\"Biden is cognitively impaired\" was a standard talking point on the Right. So long as Biden was the nominee, that fact, if demonstrated, would help Trump. (As I've argued, if the fact helped Democrats replace Biden with a better candidate, it might have hurt Trump, but that would have been a less direct chain of causation.) It's human nature to accept stories that fit one's political preferences than to challenge them. A thought experiment: If the sitting President in 2024 had been a Republican—whether Trump or, say, an older Ron DeSantis—would the media have acted the same way they did? Or would they have worked harder, dug deeper, and uncovered the truth earlier?\n\nYet of course institutions should be designed to counteract the flaws generated by human nature while working within the constraints created by human nature. (That knowledge was old when Madison was young.) This is true of media institutions as well as governmental ones. There need to be mechanisms to keep reporters' and editors' inevitable ideological predilections from turning into ideological blinders and ideological blunders.\n\nOf course, it's much easier to identify the problem than a suitable solution. One can imagine, for instance, newspapers deliberately seeking out reporters and editors with many different ideological beliefs, hoping that colleagues will fill each others' blind spots (or, in collegial conversations, help each other identify their blind spots). But this may be hard to implement; and, as with preferences based on race and sex, preferences based on politics may be challenged as leading to hiring based on ideology rather than merit. (They may also be defended, as with preferences based on race and sex, as a tool for fighting subconscious bias that keeps meritorious candidates from being fairly considered.) Indeed, hiring that considers applicants' ideological beliefs may violate some states' laws that limit employment discrimination based on political ideology or party affiliation,[11] just as hiring that considers applicants' religious beliefs may violate bans on employment discrimination based on religion.\n\nNewspapers might also return to prohibiting reporters and editors from publicly opining on controversial issues. Of course, realistic readers will recognize that reporters may still be biased. But taking a public stand on an issue may increase such bias: If one has publicly endorsed position X, it might become harder to write fairly about evidence that instead tends to support the rival position Y. Few of us like writing something that suggests that we were mistaken in the past, or that our critics can interpret as making such a suggestion.\n\nAgain, though, in some jurisdictions such public neutrality rules for newspaper employees may violate state employment statutes. One state court held (by a 5–4 vote) that those statutes themselves violate the First Amendment when applied to newspaper reporters or editors.[12] But in AP v. NLRB (1937), the U.S. Supreme Court held (also 5–4) that federal labor law, which bans discrimination based on union membership, didn't violate the Associated Press's rights to select reporters or editors.\n\nLikewise, one can imagine newspapers and magazines deliberately courting a broad ideological mix of readers—not just for the extra revenue, but also to commit themselves to having a base that they will need to be seen as treating fairly. A publication that has many readers on the left, right, and center might feel more pressure to be fair and careful to all sides. Of course, it may be hard these days to acquire such a broad reader base. And there's always the danger that concern about reader reactions may press a newspaper to avoid controversial topics altogether, rather than to try handling them fairly.\n\nFinally, newspapers can just try to recommit themselves to objectivity, fuzzy as the term may sometimes be. (Many commentators have expressly taken the opposite view.[13]) In their news coverage, they may recommit to discussing the best arguments on both sides of contested issues. In choosing what to cover, they may try hard to see what both sides of the aisle view as especially important. On their editorial pages, they may avoid a party line, either instituted top down[14] or by staff revolts.[15] Instead, they may adopt the policy that whatever ideas are shared by at least substantial minorities of the public should be seriously covered, even when editors think that one side is obviously wrong.\n\nAgain, though, that's easier said than done (and it's not even that easily said). It will inevitably require hard choices that will leave many observers skeptical about the media organization's fairness —e.g., which sides of a multi-sided issue should be covered, which topics are important enough to cover, which positions are such outliers that they can be set aside, how to allocate scarce space and attention. And it may not do much to solve the problem we began with, which is the ability of media organizations to be massively duped by the side they sympathize with.\n\nThus, these solutions are likely to be far from perfect. The cures may even be worse than disease.\n\nBut there is indeed a disease, \"a profoundly broken media system\" (to quote the workshop organizers). This system is one that the public has good reason to distrust. Its flaws undermine the media's ability to check government malfeasance. It may have been so captured by the desire to #Resist one movement that it failed to resist the disinformation spread by another. And it may thus have ended up helping the very candidate and movement that it had (understandably) viewed as dangerous.\n\n[1] See, e.g., Chris Whipple, Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History 201 (2025) (quoting Leon Panetta, White House Chief of Staff under Clinton and Secretary of Defense under Obama, as making this point); Jonathan Allen & Amie Parnes, Fight: Inside the Wildest Battle for the White House 86 (2025) (quoting \"a Biden ally\" as making the same point); id. at 90 (inferring that long-time Democratic Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi held a similar view); Josh Barro, This Is All Biden's Fault, N.Y.

If the left has any interest in being taken seriously again, two consequential things must happen. First and foremost, they must come clean about the cover-up of President Joe Biden’s cognitive decline. And secondly, they should cease doubling down on the politics of division and failed policies that were overwhelmingly rejected at the ballot box last November.\n\nAfter a decade of deception, Trump deranged politicians must stop lying to the American people. Then, of course, words must be backed up with action. This means not obstructing the investigations that are being launched to find out what happened behind the scenes to hide Joe Biden’s cognitive decline and overall health from the public eye. President Biden’s recent cancer diagnosis only adds fuel to the fire and necessitates expanding the probe from the former president’s mental state to include questions about when the cancer was first discovered. (RELATED: DAVID BOSSIE: Congress Should Probe Cover-Up Of Biden’s Cognitive Decline)\n\nAs investigations move forward, it’s imperative for Democrats to make this a bipartisan endeavor because the American people deserve no less. It’s a massive national security risk to have a sitting president incapable of discharging his duties in office, so it’s in everyone’s interest to make sure it never happens again. Congress and the Department of Justice must do their jobs to determine the breadth of the alleged conspiracy to defraud the United States during the Biden Administration and find out exactly who was involved.\n\nEvery four years American voters elect a president. “We the People” give the president – and the president alone – the power to make the executive decisions for the country. Bureaucrats, staff, and family members have no such authority. Moreover, it’s the president’s actual signature – not an autopen – that gives a bill, resolution, or pardon legitimacy. The act of signing a document makes it clear that the president is aware of what he’s doing and is in support of the measure. We must have clarity on whether the presidency was being manipulated by an unelected cabal of left-wing radicals working to fundamentally transform the United States of America into something unrecognizable. The true threat to democracy has been exposed and those responsible must be held accountable.\n\nThe mainstream media would be wise to get on board with the push for bipartisanship regarding the Biden cover-up and admit their own role in facilitating the big lie. It’s not enough to just write books about Joe Biden’s decline and the Kamala Harris-led coup and then act surprised. These are deadly serious allegations and if the corporate media wants to regain trust, it should allow journalists to follow this Pulitzer Prize-caliber story wherever it leads.\n\nAt the same time, Democrats need new leaders who are willing to criticize those in their party who specialize in opposing popular reforms due to Trump Derangement Syndrome. For example, when Minnesota Governor and 2024 Democrat Vice Presidential nominee Tim Walz compares heroic Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents trying to deport criminal illegal immigrants to “Donald Trump’s modern-day Gestapo,” someone on the left should stand up and say this rhetoric is not only wildly inaccurate but also dangerous. Polling indicates that even sixty-three percent of Democrats support deporting illegal immigrants with criminal records.\n\nSimilarly, Democrat leaders must start calling out liberal politicians from the past for spouting divisive rhetoric just to stay on cable news. Recently, former Secretary of State and 2016 Democrat Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton insulted millions of women by saying every Republican woman except a few would be a “handmaiden to the patriarchy” if they were elected president. Only a rudderless party of cowards would allow damaging and counterproductive language like this to continue unchallenged.\n\nHowever, for the left, it doesn’t end with support for illegal immigration and belittling women they don’t agree with – not by a long shot. Democrats also find themselves on the wrong side of tax increases, unleashing domestic energy to lower costs, law and order, education reform, and fighting for fair trade deals to benefit the American worker. Something needs to change for the Democrat Party in a hurry, because standing firmly against Trumpian common sense is a recipe for disaster. It starts with honesty and then acknowledging the need to change course. The American people are paying close attention.\n\nDavid N. Bossie is president of Citizens United.

The national exit polls, which are far from perfect but do provide a significant long-term dataset, showed Kamala Harris winning 18-to-29-year-olds by 11 points—a notable erosion from Joe Biden’s 24-point margin with the same cohort according to the 2020 exits, but certainly not evidence of a generation poised to vote Republican for decades. And in those exit polls, Harris actually did ever-so-slightly better with the very youngest voters in the 18-to-24 group than she did with those ages 25 to 29. But it’s also worth remembering that the further you drill into subgroup data of any individual poll, the higher the margin of error and the less confidence we can have in the results.\n\nNow a new, long-awaited report from progressive data firm Catalist should put to rest the idea that Gen Z voters are all right-wingers. In fact, they’re still the most leftist age cohort in the U.S. electorate—and there are signs Republicans are already losing them.\n\nUnlike a run-of-the-mill public opinion survey, Catalist’s postelection analysis is painstakingly created from voter file and census data in all 50 states, making their conclusions about subgroups in the electorate far more robust than the crosstabs of (for example) the latest Trump approval poll. And far from demonstrating the grip that MAGA has on America’s youth, the Catalist report, titled “What Happened in 2024,” shows that Kamala Harris won 55 percent of the 18-to-29-year-old two-party vote (a measure that excludes support for third-party candidates), down from Joe Biden’s 61 percent in 2020.\n\nWhile that 6-point drop is double the erosion of Democratic vote share in the electorate as a whole, it is hardly evidence that an entire generation has turned hard-right. After all, 2024 was the best Republican performance in the national popular vote since 2004, and shifts to the right happened across virtually all sectors of the electorate. The declines for Democrats among Black (4 points), Latino (9 points), and even Asian American and Pacific Islander voters (4 points) tell a pretty consistent story of a national environment that was more challenging across the board for Harris, and the only nonwhite subgroup that she made marginal gains with was elderly Black voters. The dropoff in support from young voters was indeed among the largest and most consequential of the 2024 cycle, with a particularly worrisome 9-point collapse in support from 18-to-29-year-old men.\n\nAnd there’s no question that the youth gender gap is pronounced, according to Catalist—young women’s support for Harris was almost 17 percentage points higher than that of young men. But despite their supposed affinity for hard-right podcasters and their media diet of toxic manosphere figures, men ages 18 to 29—who are overwhelmingly but not exclusively Gen Z—are still the most progressive group of men in any age cohort. And if anything, had Kamala Harris eked out a win last year, we would be talking about why the GOP is getting blown out with young women. Trump captured just 37 percent of the two-party vote among women ages 18 to 29, while Democrats scored 46 percent of men 18 to 29. Given that women live longer and vote more reliably (they were 54 percent of the electorate in 2024 according to Catalist), this actually seems like a much bigger problem for Republicans moving forward than it is for Democrats.\n\nTo be fair to Shor, his claim in the Klein interview was specifically about voters under 26. I reached out to Catalist to see if they offered data for smaller age cohorts, and the firm replied that “we didn’t think the subcategory breakdowns at that level had enough statistical power” to include in the report. But there’s little in their findings that would make Shor’s outlandish claim about Gen Z being the most conservative generation in decades remotely credible—and it’s also worth repeating that no other publicly available surveys, including the national exit polls, back up his assertions about young voters.\n\nThough Catalist doesn’t include results on microgenerations, it would not be surprising if voters ages 18 to 21 saw the most pronounced rightward shift of all, given the deep unpopularity of the Biden administration. Because they had the least to fear from COVID, they may have been the most frustrated by how long it took parts of the country to return to normal following the acute phase of the pandemic in 2021–2022, the most bitter about the years of schooling and socializing that were tragically lost, and the most susceptible to isolation-driven radicalization.\n\nAdditionally, the perception that the Biden administration was rolling out the red carpet for new arrivals from places like Venezuela while neglecting Black and Latino communities may have been particularly damaging with young men from these groups. The Democratic vote share among young Black men did drop 10 points between 2020 and 2024, from 85 percent to 75 percent. The collapse was even bigger for young Latino men, who gave Joe Biden 63 percent of the two-party vote in 2020 but gave just 47 percent to Harris in 2024.\n\nBut despite all this, the biggest red flag in the Catalist data is one for Republicans. Biden’s presidency presented a huge opportunity for the GOP. Even going back to the 2019–2020 Democratic presidential primaries, young people voted for Sen. Bernie Sanders by staggering margins in every single Super Tuesday state over Joe Biden, whose candidacy was essentially foisted on them by older Democratic partisans. And then as president, Biden presided over simultaneous inflation and immigration crises that invited the same anti-incumbent backlash that afflicted nearly every post-pandemic governing party or coalition on the planet. His bigger problem with young people was that he positioned himself as the august steward of a long-vanished bipartisan status quo when young people have been saying for years that the country is on the wrong track and needs radical change. As his approval rating plummeted, particularly in 2023–2024 when it was consistently hovering between the 30s and 40s, Republicans had a rare chance to stage a takeover of incoming voters whose partisanship has not yet hardened and who are particularly susceptible to picking the opposition party over an unpopular incumbent.\n\nBut even at a time of profound unhappiness with Democratic governance, the GOP made improvements with but ultimately still could not outright win the majority of young voters. As they have in every single national midterm and presidential election going back to 2002, Republicans did worse with young people than with any other age cohort, a phenomenon I wrote about in my 2020 book The Kids Are All Left. It’s not that Democrats have been doing increasingly better with young people in election after election, but rather that 18-to-29-year-olds have voted to the left of the overall electorate (by margins that have bounced around in keeping with national left-right shifts from cycle to cycle) in all national elections since 2002. Despite popular misconceptions, youth radicalism has not always been real. As recently as 2000, George W. Bush earned an even split with Al Gore among voters 18–24.\n\nThe hard truth for the GOP right now is that by pursuing such a divisive and disruptive agenda during the early months of Trump’s second term, they have probably squandered their best opportunity of the entire 21st century so far to decisively capture a group of incoming voters, or at least build on the momentum they showed with them in 2024. That’s because according to a large body of research, including most recently a 2023 study by political scientists Yair Ghitza, Andrew Gelman, and Jonathan Auerbach, voters are most impressionable and ideologically malleable in their teens and early 20s, and after that, “voter preferences become consistent, and political events hold considerably less weight.” In other words, once partisanship is set, for most people it is set for life no matter what the party in power does.\n\nTherefore even to the limited extent that Republicans made worrisome inroads with the very youngest voters last year, they seem to have already blown it. According to YouGov’s tracking poll, Trump is now almost 20 points underwater with voters under the age of 30, a finding replicated in poll after poll administered following the president’s disastrous tariff rollout in April. That’s almost certainly not just down to the economic uncertainty created by Trump’s tariff Calvinball, but also because Republicans remain on the wrong side of youth public opinion on nearly every conceivable issue.\n\nFor example, 59 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds in the Spring 2025 Harvard Youth Poll agree that “Basic health insurance is a right for all people, and if someone has no means of paying for it, the government should provide it,” a number that is close to its all-time high in that survey. In fact, every single Trump administration policy that Harvard polled is underwater with young folks, from attacks on DEI to tariffs to DOGE. That’s not how you score enduring gains with a group of voters. Even on the issue that Democrats have spent the most time litigating in a circular firing squad since November—trans women in youth sports—polling from Yale University shows that people 18 to 29 are split virtually evenly on the issue. While young people are less supportive of trans women in women’s sports at other levels, they are still far to the left of Americans as a whole.\n\nIf you compare the spring 2025 Harvard Youth Poll to the Spring 2017 edition that captures a similar moment—a newly inaugurated Donald Trump coming into office on the heels of an Democratic administration that was unpopular with young people—you don’t even see consequential shifts on the issues that Democrats are currently twisting themselves into pretzels about. In 2017, 32 percent of respondents said that “recent immigration has done more good than harm,” a number that dropped just 2 points—well within the survey’s 3.21 percent margin of error—to 30 percent in 2025. That doesn’t mean young people want open borders, but neither does it suggest that they support the kind of lawless and cruel immigration enforcement that the Trump administration has put front and center in 2025.\n\nAnd while the youth gender gap should concern Democrats, it shouldn’t lead them to reverse course on issues like trans rights and immigrant rights. Moves like that would only reinforce the perception that the party has no principles and exists only to serve elites whose chief interest is in preserving the economic status quo. Instead, the party must do much more to reach young voters with vigorous, affirmative defenses of its core priorities, and to build out a media operation that meets young people where they are, whether that’s on TikTok or YouTube or some platform that this middle-aged writer has never even heard of.\n\nUltimately, the Trump administration’s ineptitude and venality is giving Democrats a fresh opportunity to define themselves to young voters. They should not fall into the narrative trap, pushed by a certain subset of the center-left commentariat for months now, that the way forward with young voters is to move right on issue after issue.","summary":"There's actually a big red flag for Republicans in the 2024 election data.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/05/2024-election-gen-z-donald-trump-kamala-harris.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/daaa9271-61ff-4f44-9c9a-8c018b0dadc3.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 19:27:44","author":"David Faris","authors":["David Faris"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.002},{"id":323863818,"title":"After All the Trouble He's Caused, Where Has Elon Musk Been Hiding?","text":"Has anyone seen Elon Musk these days?

But now...? We aren’t hearing much about Musk as we head into the summer. So, let’s look into it.\n\nWhen President Trump took office, one of the first things he did was create the Department of Governmental Efficiency (DOGE) and placed Musk in charge of it. With this newfound power, Musk went on a rampage.\n\nHe terminated over 100,000 government employees by either forcing them to take buyouts or outright firing them. He is responsible for ending contracts for programs related to climate change, Diversity, Equity and Inclusion, environmental protection, international aid, and science research. \n\nMusk was so active and visible in the President’s first few months in office, that it inspired TIME to put him behind the Resolute Desk on the cover of one of its magazines.\n\nJust a few months ago, it seemed like Musk was everywhere. He gave a huge speech when Trump was inaugurated. (And did what still feels like a Nazi salute.) He had his kid playing in the Oval Office while talking to the media. He gave interview after interview to the media. But now he is nowhere to be seen.\n\nIt seems like my man just dropped off the face of the Earth. No one seems to know what happened to him. But it is clear what’s going on.\n\nIn Wisconsin, Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, a long-time judge on the state’s Supreme Court, retired opening the door for an election. Susan Crawford, a liberal, faced off against Brad Schimel, a conservative. \n\nThis would have not been a notable race, but Musk took an interest in the race because he wanted to turn this liberal leaning court into a conservative one. So he sunk millions into the campaign for the conservative thinking he could influence the outcome of the election.\n\nHe did not. Well, on second thought, he did. Just not the way Musk wanted.\n\nVoters found Musk’s attempt to buy the election distasteful. Those who opposed him mounted a campaign entitled “People Vs. Musk” and defeated the candidate he supported by 10 percentage points. If you think Kamala Harris got mollywhopped by Trump, then this would be the political equivalent of what Homey the Clown used to do on In Living Color.\n\nAfter that, Musk got quiet. He was not talking to the media anymore. He was not trying to influence elections like he once was. Now, seven weeks after that embarrassing defeat, he has announced that he will step away from political spending. Saying, “I’ve done enough.”\n\nGood riddance. Dude can kick rocks. One less white nationalist leaning billionaire to worry about.","summary":"Has anyone seen Elon Musk these days? What’s he been up to?

BLOOD, Associated Press\n\nLOS ANGELES — Many of Kamala Harris’ supporters and detractors alike think she’d have better odds running for California governor rather than president a third time.\n\nThere are several reasons for Harris to make a bid to replace term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom. She would immediately become the early front-runner instead of entering a presidential primary with a dozen or more serious contenders. No other candidate in California could match her résumé of having served as San Francisco district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.\n\nBeyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future. She told a crowd in Orange County in April: “I’ll see you out there. I’m not going anywhere.”\n\nNewsom has predicted that Harris would top the field in a contested primary but added, “if she runs.”\n\nTo run for governor, “you have to have a burning ‘Why?’ ” Newsom said on the “Next Up with Mark Halperin” podcast.\n\n“And if you can’t enunciate that, the answer is ‘No,’” Newsom added. “Why the hell would you want this job?”\n\nHere are some reasons why she might want it — and why she might not. Her office did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nPro: She can skip a fractious 2028 primary\n\nHarris would have to convince national Democrats that she’s the face of the party’s future, despite losing to President Donald Trump last fall. She’s also tied to former President Joe Biden, whom Democrats are increasingly criticizing as new books drive further discussion about his age and physical and mental readiness during his time in office.\n\nThe 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom. Any candidate will have to unify a fractious Democratic Party with low approval ratings and struggling to slow Trump’s agenda in Washington.\n\nDemocratic consultant Bill Burton, who was national press secretary for former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, said Harris would enter a presidential primary with a proven fundraising network, strong recognition with voters and the experience of operating in a Trump-fueled media environment.\n\nBut the looming question for Democrats is likely to be, “Who is the best person to stand up to the MAGA movement and exhibit a strength that is going to need to be really formidable?” Burton said.\n\nCould Harris make that case? Some think her time has passed.\n\n“She’s had her chance,” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement.\n\n“Voters want authentic outsiders who will shake up our broken political system and challenge an economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people,” Green added. “That’s why Kamala Harris lost, and it’s why Democrats must turn elsewhere for leadership.”\n\nPro: California governor might be a safer bet\n\nHarris calls herself a proud daughter of California, and after serving as vice president and in the Senate, she doesn’t need to chase another title. That said, California is one of the world’s largest economies by itself, and its governor becomes, by default, a national figure.\n\nShe would most likely run as a proven hand with the experience to lead California’s tussles with Trump — the state is known as the epicenter of the so-called Trump resistance — while dealing with its many problems, among them homelessness and a punishing cost of living.\n\nIn her San Francisco speech last month, she said the nation was witnessing a “wholesale abandonment” of American ideals under Trump.\n\nThe contest to replace Newsom in California is crowded, with leading candidates including former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Biden administration health secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nIt’s expected that at least some of her rival Democrats would bow out rather than compete against her, including Porter, who in 2012 was appointed by then-attorney general Harris to be the state’s independent bank monitor in a multibillion-dollar nationwide mortgage settlement.\n\nDemocratic consultant Roger Salazar, who was a delegate in the party’s 2024 presidential convention, said Harris would stand better odds in a race for governor in her home state.\n\nWith multiple election wins in California, “there is just more certainty,” Salazar said. “I think she’s got a leg up right now, but this race hasn’t solidified” with the primary more than a year away.\n\nCon: Will voters welcome her back?\n\nHow will voters view her? As a favorite daughter of California returning home? Or a two-time presidential also-ran looking for a soft landing?\n\nRepublican consultant Kevin Madden, who was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, was dubious about her chances in either race. It’s unusual for a candidate to capture the presidency after two losses — Biden was one example.\n\nAs for governor, “the California electorate is about as ideal as it gets for Harris, but nothing about her current electoral record indicates that primary or general election candidates should be scared off,” Madden added.\n\nCon: She won’t necessarily run against a Republican in November\n\nUnlike many other states, California doesn’t automatically advance a Democrat and a Republican to the November election.\n\nThe state’s open primary system has tormented many candidates — critics call it the “jungle primary.” All candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election.\n\nThe system can lead to strategic gambles. Last year’s U.S. Senate race included three prominent Democrats — U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Porter and Barbara Lee. Schiff ran TV ads in the primary that spotlighted Republican Steve Garvey, presumably a weaker contender in the general election than either of his Democratic rivals. Garvey ended up advancing to November, where he was soundly defeated by Schiff, who now holds the seat.\n\nBut Harris could come out of the June 2, 2026, primary facing a Democrat who ends up criticizing her in much the same way she’d have faced in a 2028 bid.\n\nSan Francisco-based Democratic consultant Eric Jaye recalled another Californian who, after losing a presidential race, sought to rebound in his home state: Richard Nixon. After being narrowly defeated in the 1960 election by then-Sen. John F. Kennedy, Nixon lost the 1962 race for California governor. (Of course, Nixon ended up winning the White House six years later.)\n\nWhile Harris is a favorite with Democrats, a slice of the electorate has deeply negative views of her, Jaye noted. That doesn’t leave her with many voters to gain, and the Democratic primary vote could be divided among multiple candidates.\n\n“I don’t think it’s in any way guaranteed that she would win,” Jaye said. “She’s a highly polarizing figure.”\n\nCon: Does she want to go to Sacramento?\n\nHarris would be coming home to a long list of problems.\n\nThe homeless crisis is playing out daily on the streets of Los Angeles and other big cities. Newsom this month said the state is facing a $12 billion deficit and he wants to freeze enrollment in a state-funded health care program for immigrants living in California without legal status. There is a home insurance crisis and a continuing threat from destructive wildfires.\n\nAnd as the last election made clear, Republicans will attempt to saddle her — fairly or not — with her home state’s reputation for confiscatory taxes, gas prices and utility bills, seven-figure home prices and liberal social policies.","summary":"Beyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future.

Liberal strategists are pushing the party’s megadonors to spend tens of millions of dollars to develop \"an army of left-leaning online influencers\" to help the party \"compete culturally\" with President Donald Trump, according to The New York Times. \"The quiet effort amounts to an audacious — skeptics might say desperate — bet that Democrats can buy more cultural relevance online, despite the fact that casually right-leaning touchstones like Mr. Rogan’s podcast were not built by political donors and did not rise overnight,\" the Times reported. ROGAN MOCKS LEFT FOR WANTING TO CREATE THEIR OWN PODCAST NETWORK, SAYS THEY'LL JUST 'CANCEL' EACH OTHER According to the report, a group of liberal operatives met in Washington after the election and decided to come up with a for-profit media company called AND Media, or \"Achieve Narrative Dominance,\" to financially support social media influencers. The company aims to raise $45 million over the next four years and has already raised $7 million, according to the report. Their business plan, shared with the Times, says the company will directly fund influencers and help produce their content. They will make a creator talent agency and make deals with \"four flagship creators.\" Another effort in the works is called Project Bullhorn, which will also gather donations to support liberal content creators. The project, which aims to raise $35 million in its first year, was pitched to donors at a meeting this month, where Senator Cory Booker, D-N.J., was reportedly in attendance. DEMOCRATS REEXAMINE THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA GAME AFTER LOSING TO TRUMP: NOT 'DIRECT' OR 'AUTHENTIC' Other projects seeking major donor funding include Channel Zero, a company which will provide administrative support to influencers with large followings, and Double Tap Democracy, which will collaborate with 2,000 apolitical influencers with smaller followings, the Times reported. The report comes as Democrats face a messaging and identity crisis in the election aftermath, with polls showing the party’s favorability sinking to record lows this year. According to a Fox News national poll conducted in April, the favorability rating for the Democratic Party dropped to 41%. Trump dominated the podcast scene during the 2024 campaign, reaching millions of listeners in his interviews with popular influencers and comedians like Joe Rogan, Andrew Schulz and Theo Von. Some media outlets have reported that his online presence was instrumental in winning the election, particularly for younger male voters, who supported Trump at 53%, compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris’ 45%, according to a Fox News Voter Survey last November. ROGAN MOCKS DEMS FOR SAYING ‘WE NEED OUR OWN JOE ROGAN’ WHEN ‘THEY HAD ME, I WAS ON THEIR SIDE!’ IN THE PAST Last November, Rogan mocked Democrats for calling for a new version of him to help their party. \"This is one thing that keeps coming up like, ‘We need our own Joe Rogan’ right? But they had me, I was on their side!\" Rogan said on his November 26 podcast. The Democrats' influencer strategy was criticized by Fox News' \"The Five\" co-host Harold Ford Jr. on Wednesday. \"Democrats, you can go out asking for money from donors saying we're going to create.

The pledge to eliminate federal taxes on service and hospitality workers’ tips rallied voters in the 2024 election, so much so that even former Vice President Kamala Harris endorsed the idea in her campaign against Trump. Now, both Democrats and Republicans on Capitol Hill seem to want to make it a reality. \nIt’s easy to see why “no tax on tips” has broad bipartisan support: It looks like a populist policy that gives lower-wage workers much-needed relief, and opposing it might make you seem out of touch with the working class. But as I wrote last year, “no tax on tips” would actually be more of a tax break for businesses that would cost the federal government an estimated $10 billion to $15 billion a year in tax revenue. \nIn short, the policy incentivizes businesses to lower workers’ wages and make them rely more on tips. But that’s exactly the opposite of what workers — and tipped workers in particular — need. \nTipped workers are underpaid. Some of them would certainly see their take-home pay increase if the federal government stops taxing them on tips, assuming that their wages stay the same. But tips can be volatile, and often vary by season, and a “no tax on tips” policy would make offseasons worse for tipped workers, who will likely be stuck with lower base pay. \nThe reality is that the problem for tipped workers isn’t that their taxes are too high — it’s that their wages are far too low. Plus, not having their taxes tipped means workers might end up accruing less credit toward their Social Security. \nIn fact, many underpaid workers won’t even see a difference from the policy. Some tipped workers — by some estimates more than a third of them — earn so little that they are already exempt from income taxes, which means that a “no tax on tips” law would do nothing to boost their take-home pay. More than that, “no tax on tips” doesn’t help out most low-wage workers: More than 95 percent of low- and moderate-wage workers don’t receive tips on a regular basis. \nSo while Congress busies itself with flashy tax cuts that won’t go too far in helping low-wage workers, it might be better to focus on the root cause of tipped workers’ problem: the subminimum wage.\nWhat is the subminimum wage and why is it so low? \nThe last federal minimum wage increase was in 2009, and it’s been the same since: $7.25 per hour. Many states have minimum wages that are higher than the federal level — but most also have a subminimum wage for tipped workers. That’s a carveout that allows employers to pay their workers less so long as they make up the difference in tips, and that wage is just $2.13 per hour. If a subminimum wage worker doesn’t make enough tips to reach the full minimum wage, the employer is required to pay the difference. \nThese tiered minimum wages date back to the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), passed in 1938. The legislation created a subminimum wage with the intention of encouraging employers to hire people “whose earning capacity is impaired by age or physical or mental deficiency or injury.” The idea was to ensure that job opportunities and work training programs would still be available for people with disabilities. \nBut in 1966, Congress amended the FLSA to include a subminimum wage for workers who regularly receive tips, hoping this would lower payroll costs for service-sector businesses. This change fundamentally changed the culture around tipping: While customers used to give workers tips as a show of gratitude, tips became a necessity for workers in order to make ends meet. \nSince then, workers in the service and hospitality sectors in most places have been subject to a subminimum wage that has not increased since 1991. \nWhile tipped wages are often sold to workers as a benefit — in theory, there’s no limit to how much they can make if customers are generous — the reality is that their overall take-home pay, even including tips, is often not enough. For example, the median wage for waiters in 2024 was $33,760, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the bottom 10 percent of waiters earned about $18,000. \nFor context, the standard deduction — that is, the portion of your income that is untaxed — is $29,200 for a married couple and $14,600 for an individual. “No tax on tips” might give waiters a small tax break, but it’s hardly enough to work as a meaningful solution to low wages.\nThe movement to abolish the subminimum wage\nMany workers have grown frustrated with the tiered minimum wage system, leading to the creation of organizations like One Fair Wage, which advocates for getting rid of the subminimum wage — a measure that would likely help alleviate poverty. (At least eight states have eliminated the subminimum wage for tipped workers.) \nAnd because a handful of states have already abolished the subminimum wage in favor of one equal minimum wage for tipped and non-tipped workers alike, we can see how the former holds workers back.\nAccording to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, tipped workers have a higher poverty rate in states with a subminimum wage compared to states that have abolished it. In states with the subminimum wage, 14.8 percent of tipped workers live in poverty. By contrast, those same workers have a poverty rate of 11 percent in states that have gotten rid of the subminimum wage. \nThe biggest problem with the “no tax on tips” idea is that it will likely only suppress wages, which will ultimately hurt workers in the long run. \nThere are better ways Congress can help low-wage workers than eliminating taxes on tips, including by expanding the standard deduction — giving a meaningful tax cut to all low-wage workers, not just those who receive tips — or by finally getting rid of the subminimum wage. And they might consider increasing the minimum wage while they’re at it. After all, a raise is long overdue. \nThis story is written for the Within Our Means newsletter.

But barely more than 100 days into his first term, things were going sideways for Trump. He had no major legislative victories to speak of despite having majorities in the House and Senate.\n\nFast forward to 2025: Trump 2.0 has a Cabinet that is completely loyal to his agenda. The leaks and internal strife that existed eight years ago mostly do not exist today. And unlike 2017, Democrats don’t have the Russia collusion and special counsel narratives for their allies in the media to focus on 24/7.\n\nBut perhaps most importantly, the Blue Team is currently in complete disarray and reflexively opposing Trump on issues that align them with a small majority of the party. They almost all voted against popular bills such as the Laken Riley Act, which provides the Department of Homeland Security more power to detain those here illegally accused of committing theft or violent crime. It’s an 80-20 issue with voters, yet Democrats took the 20% side.\n\nThe same goes for a commonsense bill requiring a valid ID when voting — Democrats were almost unanimously opposed to this bill as well. And it also happened with a measure that wouldn’t allow biological men to compete against women in sports, with the self-described party of women shooting that down on Capitol Hill as well.\n\nAnd then there’s the biggest news item in the cycle for Democrats that isn’t going away anytime soon that may involve not one, but two attempted cover-ups regarding former President Joe Biden.\n\nOne cover-up is already certain: the insistence of Biden officials and his family that his cognitive abilities were fine throughout his presidency. This was obviously not the case, especially with the release of the Robert Hur interview tapes, which show Biden often lost and confused, just as he was during his disastrous debate with Trump last June in Atlanta.\n\nOverall, Biden held zero solo press conferences in 2024 — Trump held 35 in the final year of his first term — and over the last two years of his presidency, he held just four Cabinet meetings. For context, Trump has held more Cabinet meetings during the first four months of his second term alone. Biden also spent 40% of his time in office in Delaware, on vacation, or both. The signs were more than obvious, especially when forgetting the names of his own Cabinet members while claiming to have conversations with world leaders who have been dead for years.\n\nThe former president’s sudden prostate cancer diagnosis is one that some medical experts have concluded is years old. Yet this was only just announced. The timing of this Stage 4 cancer diagnosis seems meant to distract from the release of a damning book about his presidency.\n\nSo the question is: Who exactly ran the country when Biden was allegedly commander in chief? Was it first lady Jill Biden, who sat at the head of the table during Joe Biden’s only Cabinet meeting last year? Was it former President Barack Obama? Former domestic policy director Susan Rice? Former chief of staff Ron Klain? Or just a bunch of different people acting in their own silos?\n\nThere absolutely needs to be congressional hearings on this because this is the biggest political story of our lifetimes. It most certainly could have been a national security nightmare given that Biden not only had the nuclear codes, but apparently wasn’t ready for that 2 a.m. emergency call if it came in, per the book.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is having what could arguably be the best month of his presidency:\n\nNew trade deals with China and the United Kingdom have led to a surge in the financial markets and have made back all losses from the beginning of the tariff war.\n\nTwo straight reports in March and April showed inflation down to nearly 2%.\n\nStronger-than-expected job reports show a surge in private sector jobs as the unemployment rate stays just north of 4%.\n\nCeasefires in Ukraine, Gaza, and between nuclear powers Pakistan and India.\n\nDuring his recent trip, Middle East nations, including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, committed trillions of dollars to investment in the United States.\n\nSanctions were dropped on Syria as a new government takes over.\n\nAnd the return of the last American hostage held in Gaza by Hamas, Edan Alexander.\n\nNow, here are Trump’s last four major polls on approval:\n\nInsider Advantage: 55%\n\nRasmussen: 49%\n\nMorning Consult: 48%\n\nHarvard/Harris: 47%\n\nSo Trump went from polling in the mid-to-high 30s in May 2017 to approaching the high 40s to even the 50s in two polls, Insider Advantage and RMG Research, this week. And when peeling the onion off further, 51% of voters now see the economy as “strong,” the first time that number has been in positive territory since early 2021, when Trump left office.\n\nAs a limp counter, Democrats are now reportedly actively recruiting “the next Joe Rogan” to counter the right’s dominance in the podcast media space. And no, this isn’t a joke:\n\n“At donor retreats and in pitch documents seen by the New York Times, liberal strategists are pushing the party’s rich backers to reopen their wallets for a cavalcade of projects to help Democrats, as the cliché now goes, ‘find the next Joe Rogan,'” the report reads. “The proposals, the scope of which has not been previously reported, are meant to energize glum donors and persuade them that they can compete culturally with President Trump — if only they can throw enough money at the problem.”\n\nYes, throw enough money at the problem, great solution. Note: Former Vice President Kamala Harris tried that during her White House run last year, blowing through $1.5 billion in less than 100 days, only to see 89% of counties go more red than blue. Besides, talent isn’t something that a donor retreat and boatloads of cash can conjure up. It must happen organically through word of mouth and viral clips, not something basically created in a lab like the podcast version of former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Democrats had their next Joe Rogan once. His name? Joe Rogan. He was a former Democrat cast out by his own party during COVID-19.\n\nAs Memorial Day weekend approaches in the first year of his second term, Trump is on an absolute roll. His polling is easily the highest it’s ever been during his 52 months in office, going back to January 2017.\n\nAnd as this is happening, the party that uses a donkey as its mascot continues to embrace jackassery, all while trying to escape a massive Biden cover-up on two fronts that may haunt them for years to come.","summary":"It’s May 2017.

On Wednesday night, one of these radicals decided to turn those words into action.\n\nThe suspected gunman, who chanted “Free, Free Palestine” when he was later taken into custody, opened fire near the Capital Jewish Museum as attendees were leaving an event sponsored by the American Jewish Committee for young diplomats. The attack killed a young couple — 30-year-old Yaron Lischinsky, an Israeli Christian who served as a research assistant at the Israeli Embassy, and Sarah Milgrim, a 26-year-old Jewish Kansas native who organized missions and delegation visits for the embassy. Shortly after the shooting came the bitter news that Lischinsky had just purchased an engagement ring and had planned to propose to Milgrim next week in Jerusalem.\n\nThe suspected shooter, Elias Rodriguez, is right out of central casting as far as left-wing extremists go. He was once a part of the Party for Socialism and Liberation, a group that advocates a socialist takeover of the United States and is consumed by loathing for both Israel and America.\n\nIn 2017, according to the group’s Liberation publication, he took part in a Black Lives Matter protest outside of then-Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s home. He lamented Amazon’s “whitening of Seattle” and described the U.S. as “a nation of cities dominated and occupied by massive corporations where only the rich and white can live and the vast majority of us must live on the edges of the city and society.”\n\nOne witness told Fox & Friends that after the gunshots were heard, Rodriguez walked into the museum and said somebody should call the police. After playing dumb for a while, according to the witness, he pulled a keffiyeh out of his bag and said, “I did it. I did this for Gaza.”\n\nAs left-wing antisemitism exploded during the previous administration, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were reluctant to take action because they feared the backlash it would cause within their own base, hindering Democrats’ prospects in Michigan. As a result, statements about antisemitism often devolved into generic expressions of opposition to “hate” and smuggled in references to Islamophobia.\n\nGiven that President Trump has made the fight against antisemitism in our cities and on college campuses a top priority, we are hopeful that the current administration will take a stronger approach. Attorney General Pam Bondi said that Acting U.S. Attorney for D.C. Jeanine Pirro will prosecute the suspect, once charged, to the full extent of the law.\n\nThe targeting of a specifically Jewish event to advance the Palestinian cause was an act of international terrorism on U.S. soil, and should be treated as such. But beyond prosecuting the suspect in this case, there must be a concerted strategy to make sure that America remains a safe place for Jews to live and worship. As this attack reminds us, radicals who seek to destroy Israel also hate America.","summary":"The targeting of a specifically Jewish event to advance the Palestinian cause is an act of international terrorism on U.S. soil.","url":"https://www.nationalreview.com/2025/05/the-intifada-comes-to-the-nations-capital/","image":"https://i0.wp.com/www.nationalreview.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/washington-muder.jpg?fit=2057%2C1200&ssl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 17:19:14","author":"The Editors","authors":["The Editors"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.001},{"id":323806498,"title":"Ex-Biden DOJ official slams Democratic Party for 'lying to everyone,' blasting cabinet over Hur report","text":"A former Department of Justice official, Xochitl Hinojosa, called out members of the Democratic Party on Tuesday for \"lying to everybody\" about former President Joe Biden when it came to Robert Hur's report, which was dismissed as \"gratuitous\" at the time. \"I was at the Justice Department at the time when we released the Hur report, and he was, the entire White House infrastructure at the time, was calling the report gratuitous, and said that Rob Hur should have never called him ‘a well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.'

Axios reporter Alex Thompson was on the panel as well to discuss the reporting about the former president from his new book, \"Original Sin: President Biden’s Decline, Its Cover-Up, and His Disastrous Choice to Run Again,\" which he published with CNN host Jake Tapper. \"So it’s really infuriating to hear this happening in the Spring of 2024, around the time that the Hur report was released and certain aspects in Alex and Jake‘s reporting really talk about the timeframe being Fall of 2023, whenever he did his interview with Rob Hur, as well as early 2024, when was the release of the report.

The request would in effect mean cooling the anti-Trump tenor of the show and potentially sparking backlash among its liberal audience.\n\nIt would appear, at least for the moment, that the calls for a less politically charged show have yet to take hold. Thursday’s program, for instance, kicked off with a segment focused on Trump’s off-the-rails Oval Office meeting with the South African president Cyril Ramaphosa, which featured the president going on a rant about the baseless “white genocide” conspiracy theory.\n\nAccording to the Beast, Karamehmedovic called a meeting with the show’s five hosts – Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sara Haines, Ana Navarro, Sunny Hostin, and Alyssa Farah Griffin – and executive producer Brian Teta, suggesting “the panel needed to broaden its conversations beyond its predominant focus on politics.”\n\nDuring the meeting, he pointed out a number of recent episodes with celebrity guests that drew higher ratings, urging the show to lean into that type of coverage more. \n\n“The move was not framed as an edict, one source said, but the suggestion alone rankled the hosts,” the Beast noted. “The group pushed back forcefully, with hosts like Navarro noting the show’s audience routinely seeks out its perspective on politics, especially when the administration’s radical attempts to upend the government can potentially affect their daily lives.”\n\nIn the end, the hosts found the request “silly” and said they were just going to do what they’ve been doing moving forward. Essentially, they felt it would “look kind of bad” to their audience if they “all of a sudden” stopped talking about politics.\n\nOne source familiar with the matter stressed to The Independent that there was really nothing out of character with this particular meeting, noting that the network “constantly has conversations with talent based on viewer feedback, and this instance was no different.”\n\n“This is not about talking about Trump. It's about balance in the show on topics,” the source added. “This conversation is really about making sure there's just balance in the show.”\n\nStill, even though the meeting wasn’t framed as an edict, and the panel has continued to focus intently on political topics while covering Trump in their typically critical fashion, it remained a sticking point for at least one of the co-hosts.\n\nNavarro, a GOP strategist and CNN commentator who has carved out a niche for herself as a vocal Never Trump Republican, directly spoke to Iger during Disney’s recent upfront advertiser presentation.\n\n“Navarro thanked Iger for allowing the hosts to continue doing their jobs in a politically turbulent environment”, the sources said. Iger confirmed he supported the show—but he also reaffirmed that the show needed to tone down its political rhetoric,” the Beast reported, adding: “The conversation made clear the suggestion to tone down the politics went all the way to the top.”\n\nNavarro and representatives for Disney did not respond to requests for comment. ABC News declined to comment.\n\nWhile the executives’ efforts to pare down the political segments on The View could be nothing more than the standard corporate push to broaden a program’s appeal, these discussions will obviously be viewed through the lens of Trump’s war against legacy media outlets – including ABC News and Disney.\n\nFollowing Trump’s electoral victory last November, Disney agreed to settle his lawsuit against ABC News over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ interview with Nancy Mace, which featured Stephanoupolous mischaracterizing a verdict that found Trump liable for sexual abuse. Trump received $15 million for his presidential library, a million dollars for legal fees, and a note from ABC expressing “regret” over the claims.\n\nWhile legal analysts were split on the merits of Trump’s defamation claims against ABC, First Amendment experts warned that Disney’s capitulation would have a “chilling effect” on the media going forward. “Many in free press circles are holding their breath,” one expert told The Independent at the time. “There is concern that we are embarking on some scary times.”\n\nThe president is also in talks with Paramount, the parent company of CBS News, to settle his $20 billion lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris that legal experts have called frivolous and the network itself has deemed “completely without merit.”\n\nTensions within the network over the potential settlement, which Paramount's top shareholder Shari Redstone is pushing as the company seeks the Trump administration’s approval for a merger with Skydance, have resulted in the resignations of CBS News chief Wendy McMahon and 60 Minutes executive producer Bill Owens. \n\nMcMahon and Owens made it clear they would not apologize for the interview as part of any settlement with the president. Meanwhile, it’s been reported that Paramount is willing to pay the president as much as $50 million to make the lawsuit go away.","summary":"One source familiar with the matter stressed to The Independent that the network ‘constantly has conversations with talent based on viewer feedback, and this instance was no different’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/the-view-donald-trump-bob-iger-b2756163.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/11/18/00/2024-10-09T162306Z_48465156_RC2FGAAUET79_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-HARRIS.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/JQyqxJ26-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-22 16:49:39","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.055},{"id":323789126,"title":"Redstone waffles on $20B Trump suit | Reporter Replay","text":"New York Post\n\n See All Videos \n\n Recommended \n\n Navy technician accused of making false bomb threat on Hawaiian Airlines flight \n\n Dramatic video shows oblivious onlooker posing as Mexican ship crashes into Brooklyn Bridge \n\n Putin’s alleged son seen in leak | Reporter Replay \n\n Illegal immigrant convicted in Morin trail slaying | Reporter Replay \n\n Judge suspended after migrant escape scheme | Reporter Replay \n\n FBI leaving DC HQ, transferring 1,500 employees | Reporter Replay \n\n Inside Barron Trump’s college life at NYU: X-Box chats, girls and more \n\n Trump’s 5 most controversial moments with the press through the years \n\n What to know about Alito’s dissent in SCOTUS case to halt Trump’s deportations \n\n What is habeas corpus?

I don’t blame the party reputation for being low, but I think that if AOC wants to run for president and she gets the nominee, then God bless you, you are the leader of the Democratic Party,” adding, And whoever gets that nomination is gonna be it, and that’s all,” quoted HuffPost.His remark surprised Melber because Carville had criticised AOC, saying Democrats would be “better off” without progressives like Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez defining the party, and also pointed out directly in April that he isn’t “impressed” by either of them, reported HuffPost.ALSO READ: As Warren Buffett retires, Bill Ackman takes inspiration from the legendary investor and is trying to build his own Berkshire Hathaway; here's how he is doing itJames Carville's Message to DemocratsMelber jokingly responded, saying, “Well, here we backed into some intra-party news,” and added that, “You heard it here first: James Carville, once a critic of the AOC podcast landscape, now says, if you win, you win — and you got his support,” as quoted in the report.Carville agreed and said, “If you win, you win! That’s my attitude, you win the election, you got it!”, quoted HuffPost.James Carville Skeptical of the SurveyHowever, he had initially rejected the Co/Efficient survey, calling it “useless” for polling Democrats and Republicans alike, as per the report. The strategist had even argued that Ocasio-Cortez had topped the poll because GOP voters who watch Fox News, often see her discussed on TV, according to HuffPost.Carville had pointed out that those who named Ocasio-Cortez simply picked “the person they’ve been programmed” to be and emphasised that the Democratic Party would find their nominee in “due time,” as per the report.He said, “We’re not going to have one until 2028, but boy have we got some talent out there,” adding, “And I don’t have a very favorable opinion of the Democratic Party, and I have no idea who the leader of the party is, and I’m not even disturbed,” quoted HuffPost.However, Carville mentioned that, “I don’t think the party is in near as bad shape as it’s being portrayed to be,” as per the report.FAQs Did James Carville endorse AOC for president?Not officially. But he said if she wins the nomination in 2028, she’ll have his support. Why does Carville think AOC is leading in polls?He believes Republican media coverage, particularly on Fox News, has made her more visible.","summary":"Veteran Democratic strategist James Carville expressed his willingness to support Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the 2028 presidential election. This statement came after a survey placed Ocasio-Cortez as a leading figure in the Democratic Party.

Historically, the party that lost the presidency is favored in the state's off-year elections, but the GOP is hoping Earle-Sears can deliver a victory following Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin's victory four years earlier.The election will also test whether Democrats can win back key voter groups that shifted toward Republicans in the 2024 election, including Hispanic and Gen Z voters.Old Dominion was once a Republican-leaning state, but suburban shifts and growth in the northern region of the state propelled it leftward over the past two decades. Last November, former Vice President Kamala Harris carried the state by less than six points, down from former President Joe Biden's 10-point win in 2020.What to KnowTwo new polls showed Spanberger, a centrist Democrat who served in Congress from 2019 to 2024, with a lead in the state's gubernatorial race.A Roanoke College poll, which surveyed 658 Virginians from May 12 to May 19, 2025, found Spanberger with a double-digit lead. Forty-three percent of respondents said they intend to vote for her in November, compared to only 26 percent who said they would vote for Earle-Sears.Forty-one percent of Virginians view Spanberger favorably, compared to 40 percent who view her unfavorably, according to the survey. Meanwhile, 32 percent view Earle-Sears favorably, compared to 48 percent who view her unfavorably.The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.25 percentage points.The survey also found Governor Youngkin's favorability rating is at its worst ever. Fifty percent of respondents said they view him unfavorably, while 50 percent view him favorably, the poll found. Meanwhile, 64 percent of respondents viewed Trump unfavorably, while 33 percent view him favorably.However, a poll commissioned by business advocacy group Virginia FREE and conducted by Pantheon/HarrisX pointed to a closer race.That poll found Spanberger leading by only four points—52 percent of voters supporting her, and 48 percent backing Earle-Sears.It found that 54 percent of Virginians approve of Youngkin, while 41 percent disapprove. Meanwhile, 56 percent disapprove of Trump, and 44 percent approve of him. The poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters from May 9 to May 13, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.Spanberger's lead is, in part, because she is \"closer to the center of Virginia politics,\" Jeremy Mayer, associate professor at George Mason's Schar School of Policy and Government, told Newsweek.\"Republicans are going to try to paint her as far left from now until November. If they succeed, these numbers will get a lot tighter,\" he said.Trump is also a \"huge weight\" on Virginia Republicans, he said, pointing to the administration's cut to the federal government. Many residents of Northern Virginia were employed by the federal government, so the cuts \"resonate so strongly with many voters in a negative way that he is hurting the GOP brand,\" Mayer said.Mayer noted that one point of concern for Democrats may be that Earle-Sears received 32 percent of Black voters in the Virginia FREE poll.\"If that continues, or intensifies, the Democrats could see this race slip away. So Spanberger needs to figure out a way to stop the bleeding of Black support away from the Democrats,\" he said.What People Are Saying Dr. Harry Wilson, interim director for Roanoke College's Institute for Policy and Opinion Research, wrote in the poll write-up: \"Six months in a gubernatorial election season is an eternity in politics, but one would prefer to be ahead by 17 points. More than a quarter of Virginians are undecided, and there is good news for both candidates. Spanberger is obviously leading at this point, and she leads among independents, but a large number of Republicans are undecided, and they will most likely end up voting for Earle-Sears. The favorable rating for Earle-Sears, however, should be cause for concern.\"Mayer told Newsweek: \"The biggest issue so far is Trump, whether the candidates want to acknowledge it or not. He is absorbing all the oxygen in American politics right now. Most Virginia gubernatorial elections are buffeted by national tides, but this year, those tides are closer to a tsunami. That could change—Trump could morph into a more normal president, the radical cuts and dramatic rise in tariffs could recede or retreat, but unless that happens, or some other statewide issue rises up, this will be a referendum on Trump more than anything.\"What Happens NextThe Virginia gubernatorial election will be held on November 4, 2025. The Cook Political Report currently classifies the race as Lean Democratic, meaning it is \"considered competitive\" but that Democrats do have \"an advantage.\"","summary":"Two new polls found Spanberger with varying leads in the critical gubernatorial election.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/abigail-spanberger-polls-winsome-earle-sears-virginia-governor-race-2075875","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2649856/virginia-governor-race-abigail-spanberger-polls.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 16:31:44","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.423},{"id":323802158,"title":"Why Kamala Harris could run for California governor and bypass another White House bid","text":"By MICHAEL R. BLOOD\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) — Many of Kamala Harris’ supporters and detractors alike think she’d have better odds running for California governor rather than president a third time.\n\nThere are several reasons for Harris to make a bid to replace term-limited Gov. Gavin Newsom. She would immediately become the early front-runner instead of entering a presidential primary with a dozen or more serious contenders. No other candidate in California could match her résumé of having served as San Francisco district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.\n\nBeyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future. She told a crowd in Orange County in April: “I’ll see you out there. I’m not going anywhere.”\n\nNewsom has predicted that Harris would top the field in a contested primary but added, “if she runs.”\n\nTo run for governor, “you have to have a burning ‘Why?’ ” Newsom said on the “Next Up with Mark Halperin” podcast.\n\n“And if you can’t enunciate that, the answer is ‘No,’” Newsom added. “Why the hell would you want this job?”\n\nHere are some reasons why she might want it — and why she might not. Her office did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nPro: She can skip a fractious 2028 primary\n\nHarris would have to convince national Democrats that she’s the face of the party’s future, despite losing to President Donald Trump last fall. She’s also tied to former President Joe Biden, whom Democrats are increasingly criticizing as new books drive further discussion about his age and physical and mental readiness during his time in office.\n\nThe 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom. Any candidate will have to unify a fractious Democratic Party with low approval ratings and struggling to slow Trump’s agenda in Washington.\n\nDemocratic consultant Bill Burton, who was national press secretary for former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, said Harris would enter a presidential primary with a proven fundraising network, strong recognition with voters and the experience of operating in a Trump-fueled media environment.\n\nBut the looming question for Democrats is likely to be, “Who is the best person to stand up to the MAGA movement and exhibit a strength that is going to need to be really formidable?” Burton said.\n\nCould Harris make that case? Some think her time has passed.\n\n“She’s had her chance,” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement.\n\n“Voters want authentic outsiders who will shake up our broken political system and challenge an economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people,” Green added. “That’s why Kamala Harris lost, and it’s why Democrats must turn elsewhere for leadership.”\n\nPro: California governor might be a safer bet\n\nHarris calls herself a proud daughter of California, and after serving as vice president and in the Senate, she doesn’t need to chase another title. That said, California is one of the world’s largest economies by itself, and its governor becomes, by default, a national figure.\n\nShe would most likely run as a proven hand with the experience to lead California’s tussles with Trump — the state is known as the epicenter of the so-called Trump resistance — while dealing with its many problems, among them homelessness and a punishing cost of living.\n\nIn her San Francisco speech last month, she said the nation was witnessing a “wholesale abandonment” of American ideals under Trump.\n\nThe contest to replace Newsom in California is crowded, with leading candidates including former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Biden administration health secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nIt’s expected that at least some of her rival Democrats would bow out rather than compete against her, including Porter, who in 2012 was appointed by then-attorney general Harris to be the state’s independent bank monitor in a multibillion-dollar nationwide mortgage settlement.\n\nDemocratic consultant Roger Salazar, who was a delegate in the party’s 2024 presidential convention, said Harris would stand better odds in a race for governor in her home state.\n\nWith multiple election wins in California, “there is just more certainty,” Salazar said. “I think she’s got a leg up right now, but this race hasn’t solidified” with the primary more than a year away.\n\nCon: Will voters welcome her back?\n\nHow will voters view her? As a favorite daughter of California returning home? Or a two-time presidential also-ran looking for a soft landing?\n\nRepublican consultant Kevin Madden, who was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, was dubious about her chances in either race. It’s unusual for a candidate to capture the presidency after two losses — Biden was one example.\n\nAs for governor, “the California electorate is about as ideal as it gets for Harris, but nothing about her current electoral record indicates that primary or general election candidates should be scared off,” Madden added.\n\nCon: She won’t necessarily run against a Republican in November\n\nUnlike many other states, California doesn’t automatically advance a Democrat and a Republican to the November election.\n\nThe state’s open primary system has tormented many candidates — critics call it the “jungle primary.” All candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election.\n\nThe system can lead to strategic gambles. Last year’s U.S. Senate race included three prominent Democrats — U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Porter and Barbara Lee. Schiff ran TV ads in the primary that spotlighted Republican Steve Garvey, presumably a weaker contender in the general election than either of his Democratic rivals. Garvey ended up advancing to November, where he was soundly defeated by Schiff, who now holds the seat.\n\nBut Harris could come out of the June 2, 2026, primary facing a Democrat who ends up criticizing her in much the same way she’d have faced in a 2028 bid.\n\nSan Francisco-based Democratic consultant Eric Jaye recalled another Californian who, after losing a presidential race, sought to rebound in his home state: Richard Nixon. After being narrowly defeated in the 1960 election by then-Sen. John F. Kennedy, Nixon lost the 1962 race for California governor. (Of course, Nixon ended up winning the White House six years later.)\n\nWhile Harris is a favorite with Democrats, a slice of the electorate has deeply negative views of her, Jaye noted. That doesn’t leave her with many voters to gain, and the Democratic primary vote could be divided among multiple candidates.\n\n“I don’t think it’s in any way guaranteed that she would win,” Jaye said. “She’s a highly polarizing figure.”\n\nCon: Does she want to go to Sacramento?\n\nHarris would be coming home to a long list of problems.\n\nThe homeless crisis is playing out daily on the streets of Los Angeles and other big cities. Newsom this month said the state is facing a $12 billion deficit and he wants to freeze enrollment in a state-funded health care program for immigrants living in California without legal status. There is a home insurance crisis and a continuing threat from destructive wildfires.\n\nAnd as the last election made clear, Republicans will attempt to saddle her — fairly or not — with her home state’s reputation for confiscatory taxes, gas prices and utility bills, seven-figure home prices and liberal social policies.","summary":"The 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom.","url":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/2025/05/22/democrats-harris/","image":"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Democrats_Harris_10877_d22b3b.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 16:30:07","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.06},{"id":323796120,"title":"Why Kamala Harris could run for California governor and bypass another White House bid","text":"By MICHAEL R.

But Rivoli balked at paying $2,500 for a classic-rock cover band as opposed to a Springsteen-specific group. \n\n“Unfortunately it’s just too much money I wanted to do the Springsteen tribute for that money in my social media team would have promoted it we would have done well but now because Bruce can’t keep his mouth shut we’re screwed,” Rivoli wrote in a text message to Hobicorn obtained by NJ Advance Media.\n\nIn a message sent to bassist Guy Fleming, Rivoli wrote, “Whenever the national anthem plays, my bar stands and is in total silence, that’s our clientele. Toms River is red and won’t stand for his bull----.” \n\nThe gig was scheduled months in advance, and the last-minute cancellation meant the nine working musicians in the group were losing out on a paycheck. \n\n“This is not political for us at all,” Hobicorn said Thursday. “We’re just a cover band that’s trying to make some money and people rely on it financially. We’re the ones really getting hurt.”\n\nThe cancellation led Fleming to post a message about the situation on Facebook on Wednesday.\n\nHobicorn said after Fleming’s Facebook post, Rivoli contacted Hobicorn and denied ever canceling the gig. But the band decided they didn’t want to play the event after everything that had transpired. \n\n“At that point, there were negative vibes about the whole thing,” Hobicorn said. “There was definitely a safety concern.”\n\nWith the gig in Toms River canceled, No Surrender will instead play Headliner Oasis in Neptune Township on May 30. \n\nAs of Thursday morning, the event is still listed on Riv’s Toms River Hub website. \n\nRivoli did not respond to multiple calls for comment Thursday. A request for comment left at the bar Thursday was not returned at publishing time. \n\nRivoli has been in hot water before. In 2020, images surfaced of Rivoli’s previous business — Rivoli’s Restaurant, also in Toms River; closed since 2016 — posting the message “I can breathe, I obey law‚“ on the restaurant’s exterior marquee, at the time referencing the death of Eric Garner, who reportedly told a New York City police officer ”I can’t breathe\" while he was in a chokehold, shortly before he died. Rivoli publicly apologized in 2020. \n\nThis is also not the first bar in the historically right-leaning Ocean County town to come under fire for mixing conservative politics with their business. Earlier this year, Aqua Blu Kitchen and Cocktails received backlash after adding a “Proud Boys Burger” to their menu, referencing the far-right extremist group. They’d previously advertised dishes called “the Border Czar” and “Make Fries Great Again.”\n\nAdditionally, No Surrender is not the first Boss tribute band to be affected by Trump and Springsteen’s mutual ire. In 2017, the B Street Band — the preeminent local act covering Bruce’s tunes — was widely vilified after it was booked to play a Trump inaugural ball in Washington (Trump himself was not expected to attend). They eventually withdrew from the gig.\n\nEditor’s note: This story has been updated to correct the agreed-to payment for No Surrender’s performance at Riv’s Toms River Hub.\n\nRelated coverage:\n\n• Springsteen blasts Trump yet again, calls him ‘incompetent and treasonous’ at concert\n\n• Trump attacks Springsteen: Read the President’s entire 151-word rant against Bruce\n\n• Trump wants Springsteen investigated, claims he took dirty money to support Kamala Harris\n\n• N.J. restaurant that sold ‘Proud Boys’ burger has history of right-leaning menu items\n\n• Trump blasts Springsteen like never before: ‘Dumb as a rock,’ should ‘KEEP HIS MOUTH SHUT’\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

The hosts, who were bothered by the recommendation, pushed back, arguing that much of their audience is seeking their take on the political world.\n\nThe women found the input “silly” and agreed “they were just going to keep doing their thing,” a source familiar with the situation told the Beast.\n\nHowever, the directive to cool things down was reiterated by Disney CEO Bob Iger in a conversation with Navarro last week, multiple sources told the Beast.\n\nABC News, Disney, and Navarro did not comment to the Beast on the story, and have yet to break their silence.\n\nSince leaving The View, McCain has criticized the show for its lack of a pro-Trump voice. \n\n“It is actual malfeasance on the part of ABC news that there isn’t one single conservative woman on The View this morning who voted for Trump or simply isn’t repulsed by his supporters to explain to America why he is still so popular,” she wrote on X the day after Trump won the presidency.\n\n“It’s a radical progressive insane asylum and that is why I left years ago,” she wrote in a separate post that week.\n\nMcCain, 40, is the daughter of late Republican Sen.

In March, CNN polling showed the favourability rating for the Democrats at just 29% – a record low in CNN polls dating back to 1992.\n\nThe problem with the Democratic party “isn’t a lack of talent”, says Federico de Jesús, a Democratic strategist and spokesman for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign who I interviewed for this story. It is a “problem of vision and strategy”, he argues. \n\n“A lot of people, in theory, agree with the Democrats on a lot of issues. But they don’t necessarily feel comfortable with the direction the party is taking.” De Jesús told me that the Democrats allowed themselves to become identified by “woke issues” by many voters who abandoned them in November. \n\nHowever, the Democrats now have some reasons to celebrate. In early April, a Democratic-backed judge called Susan Crawford secured a seat in Wisconsin’s Supreme Court. This kept liberal control of the state’s highest court intact. And a Reuters/Ipsos poll released a few weeks later showed that only 37% of US voters approve of Trump’s handling of the economy.\n\nGet your news from actual experts, straight to your inbox.

This time, in the absence of clear leaders, the challenge is quite high for the Democrats.\n\nBut who are the Democrats positioning themselves to lead the struggle against Trump’s policies? The acts of defiance are coming from two fronts: lawmakers in Congress and governors. \n\nSenate minority leader Charles Schumer has predicted that the Democrats will win back control of the Senate after the 2026 midterm elections. “The electorate will desert the Republican candidates who embraced Trump in an overwhelming way”, he said on April 23.\n\nOthers, like California senator Adam Schiff and Maryland congressman Jamie Raskin, are using tactics like holding town halls in strong Republican districts to rally the opposition. Michigan congressman Shri Thanedar even filed articles of impeachment against Trump on April 28, but top Democrats shot down the effort as impractical. \n\nAt the same time, House of Representatives minority leader Hakeem Jeffries is facing an intra-party effort to unseat many long-time lawmakers in solid Democratic districts. David Hogg, vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, is pledging US$20 million (£15 million) to end a culture of “seniority politics” which allows “asleep at the wheel” lawmakers to stay in office. \n\nBut it is New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who has been stealing the headlines. She is setting fundraising records, preparing for an effort to challenge Schumer in a New York senatorial primary in 2028. Surveys this early are rarely predictive, but an April head-to-head poll has Ocasio-Cortez leading Schumer by double digits.\n\nThree Democrat governors are standing out at present: Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro, Minnesota’s Tim Walz and California’s Gavin Newsom. \n\nShapiro is very popular with voters in his crucial swing state, and gets good marks even from Republicans on his bipartisan record. Walz was Kamala Harris’s running mate in November’s election, and his campaign performance was well received by his party. Walz is an obvious contender to run for the White House in 2028.\n\nBut Newsom is probably the most notable of the three. While he’s been critical of his party, telling the Hill newspaper on April 21 that Democrats haven’t performed a thorough autopsy of what led to the loss in November, he is seen as someone who can address Republican voters well. \n\nA second tier of governors include Michigan’s Gretchen Whitmer, whose soft criticism of the Trump administration’s tariff regime saw Trump praise her for doing an “excellent job”. She is joined by Maryland’s Wes Moore, who is young and popular in his state, and JB Pritzker of Illinois. \n\nPritzker called for “mass mobilisations and disruption” against Trump at a Democratic event in New Hampshire in late April. “These governors need to stand out”, said de Jesús, “either by fighting against Trump, or either [by] achieving something memorable.”\n\nHarris had largely kept a low profile since November’s election. But on April 30 she sharply criticised Trump’s first 100 days in office during a speech in San Francisco. She may decide to enter the race for California governor in the summer of 2025.\n\nDark horse leader\n\nThere could also be a dark horse leader waiting in the wings: Rahm Emanuel. As former Chicago mayor, Illinois congressman, Obama and Bill Clinton aide and US ambassador to Japan, he is considered a political heavyweight. \n\nEmanuel has hinted he may again run for public office, while criticising the party’s focus on gender issues and not on “kitchen table” issues as reasons for November’s defeat.\n\nProgressives chafe at the idea of dialling down the talk about certain policies, such as gender and identity issues. But both Newsom and Emanuel are among those suggesting that the focus should instead shift to defending changes that most voters can relate to.\n\nAt the moment, the party still lacks a clear leader and direction to recover from the 2024 defeat. Newsom, for instance, told the Hill that he doesn’t “know what the party is”. “I’m still struggling with that,” he added.\n\nAccording to de Jesús, “people don’t necessarily want someone to just hate Trump, but to identify the issues voters care about and co-opt that populist message.”","summary":"There has been a lack of unified opposition from the Democratic party since Trump took office.","url":"https://theconversation.com/the-top-democrats-leading-the-fight-against-trumps-agenda-254869","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/668765/original/file-20250519-56-yb1kzb.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=0%2C0%2C5411%2C2705&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 16:21:23","author":"City St George's,City St. George's,Department of Journalism,Fernando Pizarro,Lecturer,University of London","authors":["City St George's","City St. George's","Department of Journalism","Fernando Pizarro","Lecturer","University of London"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.252},{"id":323778480,"title":"‘Constant lying and gaslighting’: Biden rival rages at Democratic Party","text":"Former Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.) attacked his own party for engaging in a “cover-up” of former President Joe Biden’s health. \n\nPhillips, who launched a primary challenge to Biden during the 2024 campaign, wrote a scorching piece for “The Free Press” criticizing Democrats for their defense of Biden. He lauded a new book from journalists Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson that he said revealed “even greater depths\" of Biden’s “declining health.” \n\n“But as a former Democratic congressman from Minnesota who, for years, has demanded greater transparency and accountability from my party, I am outraged to see that the important lessons from the top scandal of the 2024 election have still not been learned,\" he wrote in his piece titled, “I Warned My Party About Biden’s Health. Will They Listen Now?”.\n\n“Constant lying and gaslighting the public about Biden’s health has cost the Democratic Party the public’s trust. Rebuilding it first requires the courage and honesty to admit to what happened,” he continued.\n\nPhillips chose not to run for reelection after his unsuccessful bid to unseat Biden on the top of the Democratic ticket. As he noted in his new piece, Phillips repeatedly called for an open Democratic primary during his campaign and cited concerns about the then-president’s health. \n\nHe explained that he thought Biden was “unfit to serve” after the White House holiday party in December 2022. He said he urged other Democrats, like California Gov. Gavin Newsom, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, and then-Vice President Kamala Harris to enter the race. \n\nBut when no one wanted to challenge Biden, Phillips decided that it was his turn to enter the race. He accused the Democratic Party of trying to “discredit” him by trying to block his name from the ballot and deciding to hold no debates during the primary.\n\n“This wasn’t a fight for democracy, rather a coordinated fight against democracy—executed by a private corporation with no accountability to voters,\" Phillips wrote.\n\n“For a party ostensibly focused on protecting democracy and expanding voter rights and access, denying Democratic primary voters a single alternative to Biden was nothing short of rank hypocrisy,” he added.\n\nEarlier in the piece, he also said it was not a “coincidence” that Biden’s office announced his cancer diagnosis ahead of the release of Tapper’s book. This echoed rhetoric from some liberals and Republicans who accused Democrats of engaging in a “cover-up” of Biden’s health.\n\n“Coincidence? I think not,” Phillips wrote. “Numerous doctors have pointed out how unlikely it is that Biden was just diagnosed with this cancer. Biden himself even slipped up and said he had cancer in 2022. Common sense tells us that the most powerful man in the world, with access to the best healthcare in the world, would have surely known.”\n\nHe concluded his piece by urging Democrats to come “clean” about what they knew about Biden’s health.\n\n“If a relatively little-known congressman like me knew that Biden was incapable of leading the country in a second term, what does that say about the complicity of the real party bosses whose names we all know?” he wrote.\n\nThe health of Biden was a dominant concern among voters during his time as president. After a calamitous debate performance in June while seeking reelection, Biden abandoned his bid for a second term. Harris became the nominee and lost to Trump, a Republican who returned to the White House after a four-year hiatus.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nOur journalism needs your support.

There’s also a belief that anyone over 70 won’t run. \n\nBiden recently announced an “aggressive” prostate cancer diagnosis, which raised additional concerns regarding his health while in office. The former president was forced out of the 2024 race after a catastrophic debate performance against President Donald Trump in June last year, and he was replaced atop the Democratic ticket by then-Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nDemocratic strategists have also grown tired of the former president claiming he would have won had he stayed in the race. \n\nAnthony Coley, a Democratic strategist who worked for the Biden administration, told The Hill last week, “Would it be nice if Biden finally accepted and admitted he shouldn’t have run for a second term? Sure.”\n\n“But candidly, does it really matter at this point? History will have the final say — and its first draft isn’t looking good,” he added. \n\nThis comes as Harris is reportedly considering a run for California governor next year, but has yet to announce a campaign even as the race takes shape around her. \n\nFormer Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who’s running to replace California Governor Gavin Newsom, said in a statement on Tuesday that Harris and Biden’s former Health and Human Services Secretary, Xavier Becerra, who has announced that he’s also running for governor in the state, should apologize for covering up Biden’s health status. \n\nVillaraigosa referenced the recent book Original Sin by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. \n\n“What I’ve seen in news coverage and excerpts from the new book ‘Original Sin’ is deeply troubling,” he said. “At the highest levels of our government, those in power were intentionally complicit or told outright lies in a systematic cover up to keep Joe Biden’s mental decline from the public.” \n\n“Now, we have come to learn this cover up includes two prominent California politicians who served as California Attorney General – one who is running for Governor and another who is thinking about running for Governor,” he added. \n\n“Those who were complicit in the cover up should take responsibility for the part they played in this debacle, hold themselves accountable, and apologize to the American people,” Villaraigosa said. “I call on Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra to do just that – and make themselves available to voters and the free press because there’s a lot of questions that need to be answered.”\n\nThe revelations regarding Biden’s decline in office are set to have significant effects on how the Democratic Party conducts its elections and how candidates run their campaigns. It may also affect the demands placed on candidates, the media strategies they choose to enact, and the scheduling of presidential primaries. \n\nWhile every election leads to soul-searching within a party, the 2024 loss and Biden’s handling of his campaign led to a significant trust issue that the party will have to confront, Democratic strategists have said, according to The Bulwark. Some strategists compared it to the authorization of the war in Iraq, which shaped the contours of the 2008 primary and which saw the campaigns of those who backed the invasion crater. \n\n“Obama was fortunate because he wasn’t in D.C., so it allowed him to have natural distance. He could say ‘I’m an outsider’ without saying ‘I’m an outsider’,” a Democratic strategist who worked on a 2008 campaign told the outlet. Former President Barack Obama wasn’t in Congress in 2002 and, as such, he didn’t have to cast a ballot on the resolution authorizing the war in Iraq.","summary":"Revelations regarding former president’s decline in office are set to have significant effects on how his party conducts its elections","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-biden-health-2028-candidates-b2756087.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/22/12/32/GettyImages-1734339822.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/6QkXkcmt-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-22 15:37:34","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.194},{"id":323767786,"title":"Trump’s ‘One, big, beautiful bill’ would ban care for transgender people on Medicaid and Obamacare","text":"President Donald Trump’s “One big, beautiful bill,” the legislation passed by the House of Representatives early Thursday morning, would ban gender-affirming care for transgender people on Medicaid and the health care exchanges under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nIn the initial piece of legislation, gender-affirming care was banned for people younger than 18.\n\nBut House Republican leadership released its manager’s amendment, an amendment that described the agreements used to appease conservatives and swing-district Republicans alike, late in the evening. That amendment struck the phrase “for minors.”\n\nIn addition, the legislation would also prohibit “gender transition procedures” as an “essential health benefit” under the 2010 health care law signed by President Barack Obama, formally called the Affordable Care Act or colloquially known as Obamacare.\n\nThe legislation that passed the House on Thursday would significantly increase spending for immigration enforcement along the US-Mexico border, energy drilling and the US military. It would also extend most of the 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed during his first tenure as president.\n\n“It's one more example of health care that they're trying to rip away,” Rep. Sarah McBride, a Democrat from Delaware, told The Independent. McBride is the first openly transgender member of Congress whom Republicans have attempted to force to use a men’s bathroom.\n\nOther Democrats were more vocal.\n\n“The entire thing's a s*** show,” Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin told The Independent. “There's so much that's problematic, but I’m counting on the adults in the Senate to fix what the House Republicans have screwed up.”\n\nAccording to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, 276,000 transgender adults are enrolled in Medicaid, the health insurance program for poor people, children, pregnant women and people with disabilities. The 2022 study also found that 38,000 transgender recipients of Medicaid live in states with express bans on gender-affirming care.\n\nTrump’s 2024 presidential campaign said not only did Kamala Harris support transgender athletes playing in women’s sports, but also claimed she “supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.”\n\n“It's more than bullying, it’s persecution,” Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida told The Independent. “It’s horrible, and obviously the fight doesn’t end here.”\n\nDespite the legislation’s passage, the bill has a long way to go before becoming law. Senate Republicans, who have only 53 seats, plan to pass the legislation under a procedure known as budget reconciliation.\n\nReconciliation allows them to pass legislation on a simple majority vote and sidestep a filibuster as long as the legislation relates to the budget.\n\nRep. Mark Takano, the chairman of the House Equality Caucus, told The Independent that he wondered if the Senate Parliamentarian would determine that the change in spending from dropping gender-affirming coverage would be “merely incidental,” which means it would not pass parliamentary muster to be included in reconciliation.\n\nThe legislation passed 215 to 214, with two Republicans - Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky - voting “no” and Rep. Andy Harris of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus voting “present.”\n\nThis is not the first time that Republicans included a rider on gender-affirming care in legislation.\n\nLast year, Republicans included an amendment to prohibit TRICARE, the health care program for active duty U.S. service members, from covering “certain medical procedures for children that could result in sterilization” in the National Defense Authorization Act, a must-pass piece of legislation that authorizes spending for the Pentagon.\n\nIn recent years, public opinion has shown a desire for restrictions on transgender people. A Pew Research Center survey from February found that 66 percent of U.S. adults support transgender athletes playing on teams that match their birth gender while 56 percent support banning gender-affirming care for people younger than 18.","url":"https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-one-big-beautiful-bill-134225693.html","image":"https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_577/c9b9d8ef74afb2fa37f5df68e7fb32a2","video":"","publish_date":"2025-05-22 15:33:09","author":"Eric Garcia","authors":["Eric Garcia"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.256},{"id":323757726,"title":"‘The View’ Hosts Were Asked To “Tone Down” Their Anti-Trump Rhetoric By ABC Execs, Disney CEO Bob Iger – But They Refused: Report","text":"The hosts of The View were asked to dial back their political commentary and criticisms against Donald Trump, according to multiple sources.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports ABC News President Almin Karamehmedovic asked the hosts of The View and executive producer Brian Teta to “broaden its conversations” beyond politics and lean more into celebrity-focused coverage, according to two sources familiar with the meeting. \n\nThe ladies of The View immediately pushed back against the suggestion, noting their viewers tune in for their political perspectives. The hosts offer a variety of political backgrounds and opinions when they weigh in on politics, but the show has taken a noted anti-Trump stance since the 2024 election. The View has also established itself as a political forum where several officials and candidates have stopped by, including Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election.

While Karamehmedovic’s suggestion wasn’t framed as a directive, it reportedly did not sit well with the panel.\n\nOne source familiar with the meeting said the hosts, particularly Navarro, pushed back, arguing that viewers expect “The View” to provide strong political commentary — especially during such a volatile political climate.\n\n“This is what our audience wants,” the source said, paraphrasing the group’s response. “Isn’t it gonna look kind of bad if we’re all of a sudden not talking about politics?”\n\nDespite the push, the hosts have largely decided to continue “doing their thing,” the source said.\n\nDuring Disney’s recent Upfronts — a high-stakes event where networks court advertisers — Navarro reportedly thanked Iger for supporting the show. Iger reaffirmed his backing but also repeated the call to reduce political rhetoric.\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, this made clear that the message to shift tone had support at the highest levels of Disney leadership.\n\nAn ABC spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nOne source told The Daily Beast the conversation was part of ABC’s routine feedback process based on viewer input.\n\n“The View” has remained a ratings draw for Disney-owned ABC. According to Nielsen ratings, the show was the top-rated daytime network talk and news program during the first quarter of 2025.\n\nThe internal tensions come amid broader pressure on Disney from Trump and his allies.\n\nIn December, Disney agreed to pay a $16 million settlement — including $15 million for Trump’s presidential library and $1 million in legal fees –after the former president sued over an interview by ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos.\n\nThe anchor had incorrectly characterized a civil verdict against Trump as a rape conviction, rather than sexual abuse.\n\nTrump is also suing CBS and its parent company Paramount Global for $20 billion over a “60 Minutes” interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile CBS has called the case meritless, the company has entered mediation talks to avoid complications for its ongoing merger with Skydance Media.\n\nFallout from the dispute has already led to the resignations of “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and CBS News chief Wendy McMahon.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr — an outspoken Trump ally — has opened an investigation into Disney and ABC, citing concerns over diversity, equity, and inclusion policies and signaling that the “60 Minutes” interview could affect regulatory decisions.","summary":"Move has sparked tension behind the scenes at the show, whose outspoken panel has become known for tackling political issues head-on, it was reported.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/05/22/media/disneys-bob-iger-abc-news-told-the-view-hosts-to-tone-down-trump-criticism/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/05/105089078.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 14:18:19","author":"Ariel Zilber","authors":["Ariel Zilber"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.148},{"id":323746974,"title":"Politico’s Newsroom Is Starting a Legal Battle With Management Over AI","text":"Last year, Politico began publishing AI-generated live news summaries during big political events like the Democratic National Convention and the US vice presidential debates. This March, it debuted a suite of AI tools called Policy Intelligence Assistance for paying subscribers, which were built in partnership with the Y Combinator-backed startup Capitol AI. Politico executive Rachel Loeffler described the initiative at the time as “seamlessly integrating generative AI with our unmatched policy expertise.”\nPolitico union members, however, allege these tools violated their contract in several ways, and are taking the dispute to arbitration this July. “The company is required to give us 60 days notice of any use of new technology that will materially and substantively impact bargaining unit job duties,” says PEN union chair and E&E public health reporter Ariel Wittenberg. The union claims that it was given neither notice nor an opportunity to bargain in good faith over Politico’s AI rollout, and that the tools do work that would ordinarily be done by human staff.\n“This isn’t just a contract dispute, it’s a test of whether journalists have a say in how AI is used in our work. With no federal rules in place, union contracts remain one of the only enforceable frameworks for AI accountability on a national scale,” says Newsguild president Jon Schleuss. (PEN Guild is a unit within Newsguild, one of the most prominent unions for journalists.)\nPolitico says the publication “takes the obligations under its collective bargaining agreement seriously,” and “will continue to honor those obligations while also rapidly embracing transformative technologies such as AI that will revolutionize how our audience consumes news and information,” according to spokesperson Heather Riley.\nPolitico’s contract stipulates that the publication needs to use AI in a manner that follows the company’s standards of journalistic ethics. “We're not against AI, but it should be held to the same ethical and style standards as our political journalists,” says Arianna Skibell, the union’s vice chair for contract enforcement, who writes Politico’s energy industry newsletter. Some union members question whether there’s always appropriate human oversight over the AI content Politico publishes.\nIn one case, an AI-generated live summary used language around immigration that human writers are not permitted to use, publishing phrases like “criminal migrants” as it covered the vice presidential debates.\n“There were also factual errors that the AI inserted that night,” alleges Skibell. For example, she says, the AI credited actions taken by the Biden Administration as things Kamala Harris did. That post was later swapped for replacements without the errors, according to screenshots reviewed by WIRED. “At Politico, you can't just wholly take down articles written by human reporters without going through a series of approvals, all the way up to newsroom leadership. That did not happen for the AI live summaries,” Wittenberg claims. (Politico did not comment on the specifics of the union's allegations.)\nUnion members say they believe the AI-generated posts were handled in a way that violates Politico’s correction and takedown policies. They also allege that one of Politico’s paid premium AI tools for generating policy reports has spewed out incorrect information in the past. Politico’s human reporters broke the news in 2022 that the Supreme Court had voted to overturn Roe v. Wade, but a report on abortion rights generated by the Policy Intelligence Assistance tool in March 2025 was written as though the constitutional right was still in effect.\nPolitico’s experiments with AI are not unique in the journalism industry. The publication’s parent company, German media conglomerate Axel Springer, is one of a number of news giants that have entered into multiyear licensing deals with OpenAI, including Vox Media, The Atlantic, and WIRED’s parent company Condé Nast.\nArtificial intelligence tools have been leveraged by journalists to produce award-winning work. Two recent Pulitzer prize winners, for example, disclosed using machine learning and AI in their reporting process. In other cases, though, AI features have gone awry, like when tech news site CNET published error-addled AI-generated articles that were deemed a “journalistic disaster” by The Washington Post.\nAs media companies race to integrate even more powerful and pervasive AI tools into newsrooms, sometimes in direct collaboration with tech companies, the writers and reporters on staff frequently have little say over how the technology is adopted. Politico’s fight could help change that by setting a precedent across the industry. “AI decisions have been few and far between,” says labor lawyer Alek Felstiner. “That would magnify the importance of an arbitrator’s decision beyond what it would normally carry, because it’s going to be one of the first observed on a critical issue.”\nAlthough this is the first clash of its kind in digital media, the entertainment industry has fought similar battles in recent years as creatives chafed against certain types of AI usage. In 2023, two of Hollywood’s biggest unions—the Screen Actor’s Guild and the Writer’s Guild of America West—won hotly contested contracts that included AI protections. This week, SAG-AFTRA filed an unfair labor practice charge against a production company associated with the video game Fortnite for using an AI-generated replica of late actor James Earl Jones’ Darth Vader voice.\n“We do remain hopeful that we can come to some kind of agreement,” says Skibell. “But we're also ready for a fight.”","summary":"Politico has rules about AI in the newsroom.

That amendment struck the phrase “for minors.”\n\nIn addition, the legislation would also prohibit “gender transition procedures” as an “essential health benefit” under the 2010 health care law signed by President Barack Obama, formally called the Affordable Care Act or colloquially known as Obamacare. \n\nThe legislation that passed the House on Thursday would significantly increase spending for immigration enforcement along the US-Mexico border, energy drilling and the US military. It would also extend most of the 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed during his first tenure as president. \n\n“It's one more example of health care that they're trying to rip away,” Rep. Sarah McBride, a Democrat from Delaware, told The Independent. McBride is the first openly transgender member of Congress whom Republicans have attempted to force to use a men’s bathroom. \n\nOther Democrats were more vocal.\n\n“The entire thing's a s*** show,” Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin told The Independent. “There's so much that's problematic, but I’m counting on the adults in the Senate to fix what the House Republicans have screwed up.”\n\nAccording to the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law, 276,000 transgender adults are enrolled in Medicaid, the health insurance program for poor people, children, pregnant women and people with disabilities. The 2022 study also found that 38,000 transgender recipients of Medicaid live in states with express bans on gender-affirming care. \n\nTrump’s 2024 presidential campaign said not only did Kamala Harris support transgender athletes playing in women’s sports, but also claimed she “supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.” \n\n“It's more than bullying, it’s persecution,” Rep. Maxwell Frost of Florida told The Independent. “It’s horrible, and obviously the fight doesn’t end here.” \n\nDespite the legislation’s passage, the bill has a long way to go before becoming law. Senate Republicans, who have only 53 seats, plan to pass the legislation under a procedure known as budget reconciliation. \n\nReconciliation allows them to pass legislation on a simple majority vote and sidestep a filibuster as long as the legislation relates to the budget. \n\nRep. Mark Takano, the chairman of the House Equality Caucus, told The Independent that he wondered if the Senate Parliamentarian would determine that the change in spending from dropping gender-affirming coverage would be “merely incidental,” which means it would not pass parliamentary muster to be included in reconciliation.\n\nThe legislation passed 215 to 214, with two Republicans--Warren Davidson of Ohio and Thomas Massie of Kentucky--voting “no” and Rep. Andy Harris of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus voting “present.” \n\nThis is not the first time that Republicans included a rider on gender-affirming care in legislation. \n\nLast year, Republicans included an amendment to prohibit TRICARE, the health care program for active duty US service members, from covering “certain medical procedures for children that could result in sterilization” in the National Defense Authorization Act, a must-pass piece of legislation that authorizes spending for the Pentagon. \n\nIn recent years, public opinion has shown a desire for restrictions on transgender people. A Pew Research Center survey from February found that 66 percent of US adults support transgender athletes playing on teams that match their birth gender while 56 percent support banning gender-affirming care for people younger than 18.","summary":"‘It's one more example of health care that they're trying to rip away,’ Rep.

Well, I mean I think that anybody with a brain knows that [Donald] Trump coming on here had a big sway on the election,\" Rodgers said (2:02:06).It's an interesting comment from Rodgers, who wasn't a fan of Harris not going on Rogan's podcast.

Gavin Newsom. She would immediately become the early front-runner instead of entering a presidential primary with a dozen or more serious contenders. No other candidate in California could match her résumé of having served as San Francisco district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.\n\nBeyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future. She told a crowd in Orange County in April: “I’ll see you out there. I’m not going anywhere.”\n\nNewsom has predicted that Harris would top the field in a contested primary but added, “if she runs.”\n\nTo run for governor, “you have to have a burning ‘Why?’ ” Newsom said on the “Next Up with Mark Halperin” podcast.\n\n“And if you can’t enunciate that, the answer is ‘No,’” Newsom added. “Why the hell would you want this job?”\n\nHere are some reasons why she might want it — and why she might not. Her office did not respond to requests for comment for this story.\n\nPro: She can skip a fractious 2028 primary\n\nHarris would have to convince national Democrats that she's the face of the party’s future, despite losing to President Donald Trump last fall. She's also tied to former President Joe Biden, whom Democrats are increasingly criticizing as new books drive further discussion about his age and physical and mental readiness during his time in office.\n\nThe 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom. Any candidate will have to unify a fractious Democratic Party with low approval ratings and struggling to slow Trump’s agenda in Washington.\n\nDemocratic consultant Bill Burton, who was national press secretary for former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, said Harris would enter a presidential primary with a proven fundraising network, strong recognition with voters and the experience of operating in a Trump-fueled media environment.\n\nBut the looming question for Democrats is likely to be, “Who is the best person to stand up to the MAGA movement and exhibit a strength that is going to need to be really formidable?” Burton said.\n\nCould Harris make that case? Some think her time has passed.\n\n“She’s had her chance,” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement.\n\n“Voters want authentic outsiders who will shake up our broken political system and challenge an economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people,\" Green added. “That’s why Kamala Harris lost, and it’s why Democrats must turn elsewhere for leadership.”\n\nPro: California governor might be a safer bet\n\nHarris calls herself a proud daughter of California, and after serving as vice president and in the Senate, she doesn’t need to chase another title. That said, California is one of the world’s largest economies by itself, and its governor becomes, by default, a national figure.\n\nShe would most likely run as a proven hand with the experience to lead California’s tussles with Trump — the state is known as the epicenter of the so-called Trump resistance — while dealing with its many problems, among them homelessness and a punishing cost of living.\n\nIn her San Francisco speech last month, she said the nation was witnessing a “wholesale abandonment” of American ideals under Trump.\n\nThe contest to replace Newsom in California is crowded, with leading candidates including former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Biden administration health secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nIt’s expected that at least some of her rival Democrats would bow out rather than compete against her, including Porter, who in 2012 was appointed by then-attorney general Harris to be the state’s independent bank monitor in a multibillion-dollar nationwide mortgage settlement.\n\nDemocratic consultant Roger Salazar, who was a delegate in the party’s 2024 presidential convention, said Harris would stand better odds in a race for governor in her home state.\n\nWith multiple election wins in California, “there is just more certainty,” Salazar said. “I think she’s got a leg up right now, but this race hasn’t solidified” with the primary more than a year away.\n\nCon: Will voters welcome her back?\n\nHow will voters view her? As a favorite daughter of California returning home? Or a two-time presidential also-ran looking for a soft landing?\n\nRepublican consultant Kevin Madden, who was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, was dubious about her chances in either race. It's unusual for a candidate to capture the presidency after two losses — Biden was one example.\n\nAs for governor, “the California electorate is about as ideal as it gets for Harris, but nothing about her current electoral record indicates that primary or general election candidates should be scared off,” Madden added.\n\nCon: She won't necessarily run against a Republican in November\n\nUnlike many other states, California doesn't automatically advance a Democrat and a Republican to the November election.\n\nThe state’s open primary system has tormented many candidates — critics call it the “jungle primary.” All candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election.\n\nThe system can lead to strategic gambles. Last year’s U.S. Senate race included three prominent Democrats — U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Porter and Barbara Lee. Schiff ran TV ads in the primary that spotlighted Republican Steve Garvey, presumably a weaker contender in the general election than either of his Democratic rivals. Garvey ended up advancing to November, where he was soundly defeated by Schiff, who now holds the seat.\n\nBut Harris could come out of the June 2, 2026, primary facing a Democrat who ends up criticizing her in much the same way she'd have faced in a 2028 bid.\n\nSan Francisco-based Democratic consultant Eric Jaye recalled another Californian who, after losing a presidential race, sought to rebound in his home state: Richard Nixon. After being narrowly defeated in the 1960 election by then-Sen. John F. Kennedy, Nixon lost the 1962 race for California governor. (Of course, Nixon ended up winning the White House six years later.)\n\nWhile Harris is a favorite with Democrats, a slice of the electorate has deeply negative views of her, Jaye noted. That doesn’t leave her with many voters to gain, and the Democratic primary vote could be divided among multiple candidates.\n\n“I don’t think it’s in any way guaranteed that she would win,” Jaye said. “She’s a highly polarizing figure.”\n\nCon: Does she want to go to Sacramento?\n\nHarris would be coming home to a long list of problems.\n\nThe homeless crisis is playing out daily on the streets of Los Angeles and other big cities. Newsom this month said the state is facing a $12 billion deficit and he wants to freeze enrollment in a state-funded health care program for immigrants living in California without legal status. There is a home insurance crisis and a continuing threat from destructive wildfires.\n\nAnd as the last election made clear, Republicans will attempt to saddle her — fairly or not — with her home state’s reputation for confiscatory taxes, gas prices and utility bills, seven-figure home prices and liberal social policies.","summary":"Many of Kamala Harris' supporters and detractors alike think she'd have better odds running for California governor rather than president a third time.

Thirty-two percent said they approve of his job performance this month, up from 25 percent a month ago.His disapproval rating was down 9 points to 62 percent. The poll had a margin of error of ± 3.2 percentage points.Why It MattersSince at least the 1960s, Hispanic voters in the U.S. have generally supported Democratic candidates. For example, according to Pew Research Center, about 66 percent of Hispanic voters supported Barack Obama in 2012, and 65 percent supported Hillary Clinton in 2016. In 2020, 63 percent of Hispanic voters supported Joe Biden, according to AP VoteCast.However, 2024 saw the Democrats' lead among the group cut substantially, with only 55 percent supporting Kamala Harris to Trump's 43 percent—an 8-point increase from 2020 and the highest percentage for a Republican presidential candidate since such data has been tracked.The most recent poll suggests that Trump maintains his support among Hispanic voters.What To KnowThe poll showed that support for Trump among Hispanic voters is being driven by support for his immigration agenda and for his tariffs, with the president scoring net positives on both issues.On the issue of immigration enforcement and deportations, 53 percent of Hispanic voters support Trump's agenda, while 47 percent oppose it. And on the issue of tariffs, the same amount supports Trump's policies, while 45 percent oppose them.In April, 49 percent of Hispanic voters said they approved of Trump's performance on immigration, while 51 percent said they opposed it. And on the issue of tariffs, only 44 percent said they approved, while 54 percent disapproved.But while some polls have shown Trump's support among Hispanic voters growing, others have told a different story.The latest Quantus Insights poll, conducted between May 5 and 7, showed Trump's approval rating among Hispanic voters at 41 percent, down from 46 percent in April. His disapproval rating was up 3 points to 51 percent.Meanwhile, a poll by Equis Research, a Democratic-aligned group, in partnership with Data for Progress, found that 66 percent of Latino voters believe Trump's deportation policies go too far and unfairly target immigrants who strengthen the country. This includes 36 percent of Latinos who voted for Trump in 2024.Still, 29 percent of respondents said they view Trump's immigration actions as \"good and fair,\" agreeing with the statement: \"If some people who are not criminals suffer because of it, it's the price to pay to ensure our safety.\"Perhaps most striking, among Latino voters who supported Joe Biden in 2020 but switched to Trump in 2024—a group Equis labels \"Biden defectors\"—64 percent said Trump's deportation plans go too far, suggesting potential limits to his appeal even among recent converts.The poll was conducted between April 16 and May 5 and surveyed 2,500 Latino registered voters.In an April poll by three of the country's largest Latino organizations—UnidosUS, Voces Unidos and LULAC—along with advocacy group Climate Power, a majority of Latino voters expressed deep concern about the country's direction and the state of the economy.In the poll, 60 percent said the U.S. was headed in the wrong direction, and only 19 percent felt the economy was better than in 2024. Looking ahead, just 29 percent said they believed the economic policies being implemented would improve their financial situation.The economy ranked as the top issue for Latino voters, with the cost of living, jobs, housing, and health care cited as major concerns. 60 percent believed Trump and congressional Republicans were not doing enough to lower everyday costs, and 66 percent said Trump's proposed tariffs would harm their economic opportunities by raising prices.On immigration, a majority of Latinos supported a pathway to citizenship for long-term undocumented immigrants or those brought to the U.S. as children. While 78 percent supported deporting dangerous criminals, they opposed targeting undocumented immigrants without criminal records.Additionally, 43 percent said they feared immigration authorities might arrest them, even if they were U.S. citizens or had legal status.The poll surveyed 1,002 Hispanic registered voters.What Happens NextTrump's approval rating could fluctuate in the coming weeks, depending on the outcome of key events, including critical negotiations in the Russia-Ukraine war, the evolving tariff situation and concerns about a recession.","summary":"The 2024 election saw Democrats' lead among Latinos cut substantially.

In 2020, he said that “a good portion of our fine country, to my eye, has been thoroughly hypnotized, brainwashed by a con man from Queens.”\n\nHe knows the outer-borough reference still stung a man who built his own tower in Manhattan and ascended to the presidency. Trump often stays at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \n\nSpringsteen grew up in New Jersey — you may have heard — and lives in Colts Neck, New Jersey, now.\n\nTrump doesn't hesitate to go after the biggest musical names that speak out against him, like Beyoncé and Taylor Swift. But the political risk may be less; their younger, more female audiences are less likely to intersect with Trump's core constituency.\n\nDuring his career, Springsteen has challenged his audience politically beyond presidential endorsements. The 1995 album “The Ghost of Tom Joad” bluntly documented the lives of struggling immigrants — Mexican and Vietnamese among them. And his 2001 song “American Skin (41 Shots),\" criticized the shooting by New York City police officers of an unarmed Guinean immigrant named Amadou Diallo, angering some of the blue-collar segments of his fan base.\n\nClearly, Springsteen has conservative fans and some who wish he'd steer clear of politics, Light said. Still, “40 years later, it's hard to imagine what they think would happen” with Trump, he said.\n\nWhile Trump made a point to reference Springsteen's criticism in an overseas show, he and the E Street Band haven't performed in the United States since before the 2024 election. His tour last year hit heavily on themes of mortality, less of politics. He has several European tour dates scheduled this year into July and hasn't announced any new American shows.","summary":"The rock star and the president are both guys in their 70s with homes in New Jersey - but the similarities end there","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bruce-springsteen-donald-trump-b2755987.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/05/19/14/05/GettyImages-2181618524.jpeg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/4rdgWwj6-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-05-22 13:17:14","author":"David Bauder","authors":["David Bauder"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.083},{"id":323789266,"title":"Forgetting Joe Biden","text":"Donald Trump has lost it — but then again, I don’t think he ever had it. The president has become dramatically unhinged on several occasions recently. Coupled with his statements about shark electrocution, and his evident confusion about where and how groceries are sold, how tariffs function, Russia versus Ukraine, trade with China, immigration and a variety of other topics, Trump often sounds like an escapee from a mental ward run by Nurse Ratched. \n\nAs the depleted White House press pool gathered Wednesday in the Oval Office, NBC’s Peter Alexander attempted to ask Trump a very simple question about the Boeing 747 that the president claims the government of Qatar gave him as a gift.\n\nTrump went nuts. “Number one, you don’t have what it takes to be a reporter. You’re not smart enough,” Trump yelled at Alexander, who has spent more years reporting than Trump has spent in politics. “You’re a terrible reporter,” he concluded.\n\nHe then tried to lecture South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on the supposed “white genocide” in South Africa. He forced Ramaphosa to watch a four-minute propaganda film pushing the conspiracy theory that South Africa's government is victimizing white farmers in racially targeted killings.\n\nAll Ramaphosa could do was say he was sorry that he didn’t have a plane to give him.\n\nThis was not America’s finest hour.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Trump blew up at a reporter on Capitol Hill who asked him a question about his so-called big, beautiful bill. The reporter asked him to respond to a statement by Representative Andy Harris, a Republican representing Maryland’s First District: “Andy Harris said that you didn’t adequately convince enough people to vote for the bill?”\n\nTrump, visibly upset, asked the reporter who he worked for, to which the reporter replied “NOTUS,” which stands for News of the United States.\n\n “Who?” Trump replied. “I don't even know what the hell that is. Get yourself a real job.”\n\nLater, when meeting with Republican members of Congress, Trump melted down, according to several congressmen who were present, and unleashed an expletive-laden warning against further gutting Medicaid. Whatever else, just be sure to know Trump’s rants can’t disguise the fact that this horrendous budget bill will take money out of the mouths of the poor and pour it into the bloated mouths of the rich.\n\nAt 1:34 a.m. Monday morning, Trump found himself awake and rage-tweeting about Kamala Harris and Bruce Springsteen, threatening to investigate both of them after Springsteen said on a Manchester, England, stage last week that the Trump administration was “corrupt, incompetent and treasonous.”\n\nTrump is angry, apparently unstable and growing visibly worse by the day. His comments about former President Joe Biden’s cancer diagnosis were muddled, angry and accusatory, including references to “auto pens” and cognitive tests. Maybe he was just promoting Jake Tapper’s new book. Maybe he is getting a cut.\n\n“Look at politics today,” former Missouri Republican Senator John Danforth told me Wednesday. “Every politician associated with the president always looks angry.” The 88-year-old former senator is currently working for the group “Our Republican Legacy” and trying to “drag the party back toward the center and our traditional values.” Perhaps his success can best be measured by how often he interacts with the current senator from Missouri, Republican Josh Hawley. “I haven’t spoken to him in seven years,” Danforth said.\n\nHawley is not only a part of the Trump machine, but one of its leading advocates in the Senate.\n\nHawley infamously raised his fist and pumped it for Donald Trump on January 6. After a recent spate of disastrous storms, Hawley found himself this week in Congress begging for FEMA aid for his state – after Trump’s DOGE cuts have rendered FEMA a political eunuch.\n\n“We are desperate for assistance in Missouri,” he told Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. “FEMA assistance will be the only assistance,” he emphasized. Because of DOGE cuts, FEMA recently reported it is understaffed, underfunded and probably couldn’t handle the coming hurricane season.\n\nDOGE, as run by Elon Musk — who is apparently on his way out the Trump door – has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike; Sen. Danforth among them. “The effect that DOGE thing is going to have on the national debt is negligible. It's very small. It could be worth doing, but it should be done with a scalpel, not with a meat axe.”\n\nTrump, meanwhile, still hasn’t dealt with the storms that killed at least 28 people when tornadoes struck Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia last Friday. Yet he was swift to criticize former President Joe Biden’s recent prostate cancer diagnosis. So was his vice president, whose reaction was certainly wooden. \"Whether the right time to have this conversation is now or sometime in the future, we really do need to be honest about whether the former president was capable of doing the job,\" JD Vance insisted. \n\nOne of Trump’s interchangeably moronic adult sons even ridiculously asked why Biden’s wife, Dr. Jill Biden (who has a doctorate in education), didn’t diagnose the former president’s cancer earlier. “What I want to know is how did Dr. Jill Biden miss stage five metastatic cancer,\" the businessman wrote above the post, \"or is this yet another coverup???\"\n\nThe Trump team’s only response to anything is to blame Biden and draw attention away from the ineptitude, corruption and anger that continues to tear the country apart and is clearly the responsibility of the befuddled huckster living at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. And if you think Biden’s administration was complicit in hiding his cognitive decline, take a look at those who work for Trump.\n\n“They’ve gotten to the point where the facts are solely what is said by the President,” former Bill Clinton press secretary Joe Lockhart explained to me recently on “Just Ask the Question.”\n\nThe greater threat is “that future presidents from both parties will take their cues from Trump because he’s been effective at manipulating the press to his benefit.”\n\nIf you are concerned about Biden’s cognitive abilities when he was president, why can’t you spend the same amount of energy on Trump, who is currently the president? I don’t want to wait until Jake Tapper writes a post-mortem book about Trump and then goes on another mea culpa tour to publicize it. If you think we made a mistake about Biden, fine.\n\nBut, we dare not make the same mistake about Trump. Trump is a danger to Democracy; a blithering idiot and those around him do not care. They take advantage of it. People like Stephen Miller feed Trump what they want him to hear and Trump spits it out. For they all know the bottom line that guides everything: It’s only a fact if Trump says it is.\n\nThat is a frightening and sobering realization. When our reality has less to do with our shared experiences and facts, and more to do with the prejudices of a single (warped) mind, we all suffer. \n\nTrump doesn’t believe in an empirical reality based on facts and science, but only on what he proclaims to be factual and true. The morons and monsters on his staff, in his Cabinet and kissing his, ahem, ring in Congress are all complicit in his corruption of reality in order to hold on to power and money. \n\nHow far have we fallen? \n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nI grew up believing in a free press. During this administration, the Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, ABC News and CBS News have all bent the knee to Donald Trump. This week I read a CNN headline saying that Trump’s “credibility” is on the line. What credibility? The man told more than 30,000 lies during his first four years in office. He’s not getting better. And everyone with an ownership stake in media is kissing Trump’s, ahem, ring. \n\nTrump’s meltdown in the Oval Office on Wednesday is just the latest indication that the land of the free and the home of the brave are a fiction from our past. Today, we are the land of the entitled led by the demonically befuddled. Why is it that the richest are like visitors to a family barbecue who take 90 percent of the food and refuse to share with the rest of us?\n\nThe rich get tax cuts, health care and preferential treatment. The rest of us get screwed and have to watch a bad fictional film in the Oval Office presenting the ludicrous claim that white farmers in South Africa are the victims of genocide. “He’s saying to white people that you’re being oppressed, which is ridiculous,” Danforth said.\n\nThere is no fact that Trump won’t bend, no rule he won’t break and no law he won’t ignore. We haven’t even talked about every judge who rules against him being accused of political activism.\n\nOur founding fathers’ overriding concern was the concentration of political power in a few hands. Today, it is distilled into the hands of one man: an aging septuagenarian who doesn’t even know that his greatest responsibility is to uphold the Constitution. He swore an oath to it, but he is too far gone to either acknowledge that or admit to it. He wants his options open so he can make transactions that only favor him and his family business. So, stick around and enjoy his multi-million dollar, taxpayer-subsidized military parade to celebrate his birthday on June 14. \n\n“That really is a serious problem for America,” Danforth said. “It's important to understand that problem. I'm not sure what to do about it. But it is important to understand that it is the case that a lot of power has been concentrated in a very few hands. And with regard to executive orders, a lot of political power has been concentrated in the hands of one person.”\n\nWho is appealing to our better angels? It’s all anger all of the time from a White House that is trying to control the economy through tariffs and silence anyone opposed to them. His supporters? Danforth says they can be reached — but not from the far left. “With Trump, it isn't that they're just delighted with him, but they view him as the only alternative. They think that the country is going down the drain and their kids are being taught all kinds of things in elementary school that they don't like. They think the left is just shoving the rest of the country into the arms of Donald Trump.”\n\nDonald Trump. The aging, cognitively dysfunctional monarch wannabe who screams at reporters, threatens entertainers and prosecutes those who oppose him runs this country while being fed a steady diet of intellectual drivel from his loyal henchmen. Forget Joe Biden. Concentrate on Trump.\n\n“You know, it's not to say that Trump is just some kind of ogre,” Danforth said. It's just saying, well, take him at his word. He's ignorant.”\n\nThe truth is that Donald Trump and his entire administration are both.","summary":"Trump's problems today are more important than Biden's problems yesterday","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/05/22/forgetting-joe-biden/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2023/10/joe_biden_donald_trump_1705691873_1718908805.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 13:12:26","author":"Brian Karem","authors":["Brian Karem"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.545},{"id":323741986,"title":"Why Beto O’Rourke May Never Stop Running","text":"When I profiled O’Rourke in 2019 for the cover of this magazine, he had narrowly lost his Senate race against Senator Ted Cruz and was on the brink of a quixotic run to be the Democratic nominee. He didn’t last long, with progressives accusing him of coming on like an entitled white man awaiting his coronation (Joe Biden would eventually be the nominee and then the president). And then came the run for governor of Texas, against Greg Abbott, which O’Rourke lost by 11 percentage points despite raising more money than Abbott and despite the incumbent’s unpopularity following the failure of the Texas power grid in 2021. Over the years, O’Rourke also taught a class on democracy at the University of Texas at Austin and authored a book called We’ve Got to Try: How the Fight for Voting Rights Makes Everything Else Possible, and he’s recently spent time registering college-age voters for an organization called Powered by People.\nThis interview spans two conversations conducted over the past week and has been edited for clarity and length.\nVanity Fair: After three bruising losses, did you consider hanging it up?\nBeto O’Rourke: No. I mean, the way I look at it, all the reasons I had to run—how much Greg Abbott and Donald Trump, the status quo, were hurting the people of the state, people that I’ve met, and people that I care about; the abortion ban; the voucher scam that’s draining public schools; the fact that it’s harder to see a doctor here, that it’s harder to register to vote—if those things are important to me as a candidate, then they don’t stop being important when I’m not a candidate. I will admit to you that on a lot of these days, when I was registering people to vote, especially when it was real hot, I was like, I don’t want to do this. I don’t want to go out there. Like, I don’t know, are these people going to like me, or they’re not going to like me? How many people am I going to register? Is this really working? And then, invariably, at the end of one of those days, I would feel so happy and fulfilled because I wasn’t waiting, I wasn’t watching, I wasn’t wondering. I was in motion. I was doing the thing that needs to be done, and I was doing it with a lot of other good people who are getting it done as well.\nYou know a thing or two about losing a race, and you’ve had some time to reflect. What was your takeaway from losing those races?\nThe loss is really, really tough. And it’s hard on everybody, on your family, on volunteers, on the team that you build around you, and just on the people. A lot of people invest their hopes in you. And the last thing in the world I ever want to do is let these people down.\nBut the other side of that is that I’m not going anywhere, and I’m still fighting for them. I’m still showing up. And so the work continues. And as long as I can take the long view, my fortunes aren't totally decided by the win or loss in a single cycle, but the work that you do over the course of your life. When I look at it that way, I’m okay. This fight is bigger than me.\nWhat’s your view of where Democrats stand today?\nI’m encouraged, maybe more so than you’d expect me to be, maybe more than I should be. People didn’t respond at the beginning of 2025 the way they did at the beginning of 2017, and I think that worried a lot of people, understandably. But nonetheless, people are beginning to stand up to be counted. I was just in Tuscaloosa. I was invited by some of the students at the University of Alabama who were unhappy with the fact that Trump had imposed himself on their commencement ceremony, uninvited, wanting to outshine their day of achievement and celebration. They asked me, and asked Doug Jones and a couple of other people, to come out, and I happily did. Nobody told them to do this. It wasn’t a request from the DNC or any person in office. It was just these students who said, “We want to stand up and we want to fight.” There were more than 1,500 people out there. There are some who will say, “Well, that made you feel good, Beto, and maybe that was nice for the people who were there. And maybe that’s some of that good old liberal virtue signaling.” But there really is power in people coming together. We met the leaders of that group to maybe consider running for office in 2026, to do something more than what you’re already doing, because it’s not hopeless.\nIt’s clear there’s grassroots energy, but there’s not much of an apparatus. The Democratic Party, institutionally, is in utter disarray, to say the least.\nI think this is actually a good thing because the apparatus has failed us. The overreliance on consultants and focus groups and message testing and polling and data. I mean, those may all be necessary evils, but they should really be at the margins of the work that we do. Politics is people. Democracy is people. The worst thing would be if Democrats tried to do in 2026 what they tried to do in 2024. Because we got a choice in 2024 between what people perceive to be more of the same and something radically different. And my impression is, even if many people who voted for Trump didn’t like every aspect of what he represented—they didn’t like his promise to be a dictator on day one; or saying that immigrants are poisoning the blood of America; or his participation in the insurrection on January 6, 2020—the apparatus in power, they believed, had so badly failed them that they were willing to risk almost everything for something different in the hopes that it would be something better.\nI recently talked to Ro Khanna, the congressman from California, who told me Trump may have done the Democrats a favor by wiping out the old leadership. Is Chuck Schumer, for instance, the right Democrat to lead the Senate right now?\nNo. There’s this false choice being debated, whether Democrats need to move to the center, need to be bolder in presenting a progressive agenda, or, you know, need to come up with some silver bullet message or some magic amount of money. And I just don’t think that’s the question. The question is, are you going to stand and fight, or will you surrender? We are at the very precipice on every issue that matters to us as a people, as a country, as a free nation. Will the powerful and the strong force everyone else to submit? Will we have the rule of law and apply that equally to everyone because we still believe in the foundational premise that we are all created equal? Will we remain, like Lincoln said, the last best hope of earth? Will we freely and fairly be able to decide who will represent us in positions of public trust? Every single one of those questions is being decided right now, and there are probably only a handful of generations that had this opportunity to decide the answer—1776, 1865, 1944, 1965. There have been other challenging times in American history, but never, like those that I just mentioned, so decisive or existential as this. And so it is certainly not the time for appeasement. It’s not a time to be working at the margins or the edge. It is, in my opinion, fighting on all fronts, standing up for everyone who’s being attacked, realizing that if you’re afraid to stand with the migrants today, then it will be the US-citizen child of the migrant tomorrow, it will be the “homegrown,” as Trump puts it, the following day—and then it will be you. So we’ve got to be there for everyone right at the start.\nThe conventional wisdom right now is that the working class should be the North Star for Democrats, who have repeatedly failed to connect. Steve Bannon recently told me that Democrats can’t do populism because they don’t actually like the working class. Can Democrats get past Trump’s cultural dominance with the working class?\nYeah. I do think our party got lazy and began to just assume, because of Roosevelt and Truman and Kennedy and Johnson and everything they did, I can just take for granted that working-class Americans are going to vote for Democrats. You look at states like Texas, which is one of the most diverse in the union—Houston, literally the most diverse city in the country—where is the Democratic Party here? They’ve left us to our own devices. They’ve invested a fortune in the so-called blue-wall states, lost them all in the process, and ignored the fact that come 2032, which is going to be upon us quicker than we can imagine, Texas will likely have 44 Electoral College votes, and the Democratic nominee could win all of the blue-wall states, and if they’re unable to win Texas or other significant Sun Belt states, they’ll never get to the White House.\nWe’ve been hearing for years that Texas is trending toward Democrats, on the cusp of going purple, and that whole narrative has been blown out of the water. What’s your postmortem on Collin Allred’s loss against Ted Cruz in last year’s Senate race?\nWhen I ran against Ted Cruz, it was 2018, it was a midterm. In a presidential year like 2024, unless you can really, really break out, you’re beholden to the national apparatus. Our elections are becoming less and less local, less and less about the states in which candidates are running, and more and more about the national election that’s taking place. And I think that was very, very true for Texas. I don’t have the numbers in front of me; I don’t know how much better Colin did than Kamala [Harris] did in Texas, but he definitely improved upon her performance [Harris received 42.5% of the vote in Texas; Allred received 44.6%]. But I just don’t think he could break from the gravity that these multibillion-dollar campaigns exert over everything else in our politics.\nI was on these college campuses throughout 2024, and they’re coming up to me and they’re like, “You know, Beto, my grandparents bought a home, my folks bought home, there is no way in hell I’m ever going to be able to own my own home.” And then there are folks who are just like, “This shit just doesn’t work. I know what you’re saying, I know what other politicians are saying about how important it is to vote, and our democracy is sacred, but this isn’t working. I care about gun violence, I’ve heard you guys talking about gun violence forever, and it’s more than two years after Uvalde and you guys haven’t done shit.”\nNow, I could argue and say, “Well, it’s the Republicans who are in power, and they’re the ones.” But they’re just like, “I give up. I just give up.” And you look at Texas, and in 2024 there were millions of registered, eligible, likely Democrats. It’s not that they voted for Trump. They just didn’t vote at all. They’re done. And so whoever that person or party or movement is has to speak to them. And the only way you’re going to effectively speak to them is to seriously listen to them.\nWhen I read interviews with people who voted for Trump, they all seem to be giving him a chance. And meanwhile, some Democrats are asking whether we’ll even have free and fair elections in 2026. How dangerous do you think this situation is? Do you, like JB Pritzker, think there needs to be mass mobilization?\nAbsolutely. You wait till 2026, and you’re toast. You think it’s going to happen in 2028, it’s already gone. It’s right now. I take the long view on this. I look back to 65 years ago, not an election year—mass mobilization across the country, because [Lyndon] Johnson told Dr. [Martin Luther] King, “Look, I was able to do civil rights. I just don’t have the power.” He literally said, “I don’t have the power to do voting rights.” And King says, “Okay, let’s get this guy some power.” And they didn’t know what was going to work. And then it just happens on March 7, 1965, in Selma, Alabama—John Lewis, 600 other people, end up shocking the conscience of the country into action. Eight days later, Johnson is convening Congress, and they are moving forward on voting rights.\nSo this fear, or this idea that is taking hold among some, that Trump is inevitable and that he’s all-powerful, and not only does he have both houses of Congress and Supreme Court, he has the world’s richest man and these masters of algorithm and influence across all platforms—like, we’re cooked, wow, can any one of us fight back? You look at 249 years of American history, we’ve always found a way to fight back. And, Joe, I’d say it was rarely ever the people in the highest positions of power who found the way through. It was more typically the John Lewises or Sarah Weddington, the 26-year-old who argued Roe v. Wade before an all-male Supreme Court in ’73. It’s your everyday, average people who do something absolutely extraordinary in these moments of truth.\nAnd so Pritzker is right. You cannot wait. If you wait, this will be over.\nDo Democrats need to meet the moment with a similar figure as Trump, like an Andrew Cuomo, who’s obviously a mixed bag, but a fighter, a tough guy, a dealmaker.\nI think we need it all. And before you think that’s an unserious answer, let me explain. We talked a little bit about 2024, and the apparatus, which we should probably capitalize at this point, and we can learn from that failure. And you and I are of a similar vintage, and came up at a time in America where, you know, there was a reaction to soulless corporate culture, including the stuff that was coming in over the airwaves. For me, in El Paso, that was discovering punk rock and the authenticity and the honesty of people who are just literally coming up with their own stuff, saying it their own way. Touring the country, showing up and just absolutely blowing your mind and changing your life and reminding you of just how great this place is. We were getting back to rock and roll. And I think we’re in a similar moment in our politics. It’s become overly corporate and safe and sterile and just…boring. Awful. And so, let’s see what Cuomo does. Let’s see what Ro Khanna does. I mean, compare and contrast. Cuomo, he’s like a bull, and aggressive, and almost a stereotype of a New York tough guy. Ro Khanna is so cerebral and thoughtful and just amazing in his own right, in a very, very different way. You’ve got Tim Walz in the Midwest; you’ve got Bernie Sanders in the Northeast. You have [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] from New York City. You’ve got folks like Jasmine Crockett down here in Texas. Everybody get out, everybody to the front, all at once. We’re not going to bet the country on one tactic or strategy.\nAnd let me just say, it is just absolutely inexcusable what happened in 2024. It is not okay. There was one job, and it was the most important that the country has faced, at least in our lifetimes, and that was to stop Donald Trump. And to offer something compelling and better that would win and succeed. And we failed. And if we continue to do the same thing in the same way and expect a different result, then this is 100% on us, to our lasting shame, and I’m just not going to be part of that. And I don’t think the folks that I’ve mentioned, and you brought up, are going to be part of it either. So yeah, I really reject this one-size-fits-all, central planning idea of how we’re going to overcome this. Let’s turn it over to the people, and the people will decide.\nYou recently told a town hall audience that you might run in 2026 if that’s what people want from you. So how do you determine that?\nWhen I got out on the road in 2017, I had no idea what I was doing. I literally got in my truck here in El Paso and drove, you know, five and a half, six hours to Lubbock, Texas, and met with a big crowd of 12 people at a Mexican restaurant there and just listened, and drove up to Amarillo, did the same thing—just stayed in the truck and kept driving the state, and would go back to DC, do my job as a member of Congress, come back, and drive the state. And months of that, I just knew the right thing to do was to run for Senate. And as crazy as it sounded to 99.99% of the world, I wanted to take on Ted Cruz. I knew we could beat him. I just knew it from listening to people, from being out there. Never ran a poll. You know, I couldn’t get a campaign manager, anyone who’d ever managed a campaign, to return my phone calls. Ended up getting two people who’d never done anything on a statewide basis, who did a tremendous job.\nWere you to run again, do you have a sense of the issue that is most powerful for Democrats?\nIt’s all of them. I mean, it’s the extraordinary level of corruption playing out in real time today. While you’re getting screwed, they just closed down your factory because of the gross mismanagement of the economy by the Trump administration. While these guys are getting even fatter and even richer at your expense. That’s certainly something that people are talking about. It’s the woman in Amarillo who might have to close her toy store because the cost of toys from China, the mother of the 12-year-old kid who isn’t going to get the education that they deserve. It’s people just feeling left out and unrepresented, unheard, alone, taken for granted, written off.\nI started off by telling you I’m optimistic. I’m encouraged right now, that’s where my optimism comes from. If I’m not out there with folks, if I’m just here at home and I’m scanning Twitter or reading the news, yeah, I’m pretty bummed out. If I’m out there with people, that’s where the energy, the action, the future, the hope is. I feel really good.\nSounds to me that you don’t have any choice but to run for Senate in 2026.\nMan, if that’s the greatest contribution I can make, I will make it. You know, if that’s the right thing to do, I will do it. I just don’t know what it will take. I’m not forcing anything. I’m just trying to do the right thing right now.\nGiven how horrible things are right now, it’s almost exotic to hear somebody express optimism.\nIt’s an act of will. I don’t think it’s going to come natural to us. I don’t think people are going to make us feel this way. I do think there’s a choice we’ve got to make. And I’m not immune to that; I have those same temptations, that same seeping cynicism that you’ve got to keep at bay. So keep the faith, man, don’t lose it.","summary":"The Texas politician has been hitting campuses and streets to register voters, and he’s keepin’ the faith for the Democrats.","url":"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/story/why-beto-orourke-may-never-stop-running","image":"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/682de901e4a725959625f19f/16:9/w_1846,h_1038,c_limit/vf525-beto-O'Rourke.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 13:02:53","author":"Joe Hagan","authors":["Joe Hagan"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.165},{"id":323735358,"title":"Nolte: 63% Say ‘Major Media Journalists’ Knew About and Covered up Biden’s Mental Decline","text":"Sixty-three percent of those surveyed have not been fooled and say it is “likely” that “major media journalists were aware of Joe Biden’s declining mental condition, but covered it up.”\n\nOnly 27 percent say it was “unlikely.”\n\nThat’s according to a Rasmussen poll of 1,012 likely voters taken between May 19-21.\n\nAmong those who know “major media journalists” like Jake Tapper were active members of the cover-up, this includes 57 percent of black voters, 66 percent of Hispanic voters, and even 43 percent of Democrats.\n\nRELATED — Trump: Everything Joe Touched “Turned to Sh*t”\n\nWhat I especially love is that the “major media journalists” engaging in the cover-up poll is only a tad better than the Democrats around Joe Biden, who engaged in the cover-up. When asked how serious it is that members of Biden’s staff were aware of Biden’s decline and covered it up, 72 percent say it was serious, only 23 percent say it was not serious.\n\nThe public gets it. That 63 percent can agree on anything in this polarized country is pretty amazing.

Gavin Newsom. She would immediately become the early front-runner instead of entering a presidential primary with a dozen or more serious contenders. No other candidate in California could match her résumé of having served as San Francisco district attorney, state attorney general, U.S. senator and vice president.\n\nBeyond being expected to make a decision by the end of summer, Harris said little about her future. She told a crowd in Orange County in April: “I’ll see you out there. I’m not going anywhere.” \n\nNewsom has predicted that Harris would top the field in a contested primary but added, “if she runs.”\n\nTo run for governor, “you have to have a burning ‘Why?’ ” Newsom said on the “Next Up with Mark Halperin” podcast.\n\n“And if you can’t enunciate that, the answer is ‘No,’” Newsom added. “Why the hell would you want this job?” \n\nHere are some reasons why she might want it — and why she might not. Her office did not respond to requests for comment for this story. \n\nHarris would have to convince national Democrats that she's the face of the party’s future, despite losing to President Donald Trump last fall. She's also tied to former President Joe Biden, whom Democrats are increasingly criticizing as new books drive further discussion about his age and physical and mental readiness during his time in office.\n\nThe 2028 presidential contest is expected to attract a large field, likely to include Newsom. Any candidate will have to unify a fractious Democratic Party with low approval ratings and struggling to slow Trump’s agenda in Washington. \n\nDemocratic consultant Bill Burton, who was national press secretary for former President Barack Obama’s 2008 campaign, said Harris would enter a presidential primary with a proven fundraising network, strong recognition with voters and the experience of operating in a Trump-fueled media environment.\n\nBut the looming question for Democrats is likely to be, “Who is the best person to stand up to the MAGA movement and exhibit a strength that is going to need to be really formidable?” Burton said. \n\nCould Harris make that case? Some think her time has passed.\n\n“She’s had her chance,” Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, said in a statement.\n\n“Voters want authentic outsiders who will shake up our broken political system and challenge an economic status quo rigged for billionaires against working people,\" Green added. “That’s why Kamala Harris lost, and it’s why Democrats must turn elsewhere for leadership.”\n\nHarris calls herself a proud daughter of California, and after serving as vice president and in the Senate, she doesn’t need to chase another title. That said, California is one of the world’s largest economies by itself, and its governor becomes, by default, a national figure.\n\nShe would most likely run as a proven hand with the experience to lead California’s tussles with Trump — the state is known as the epicenter of the so-called Trump resistance — while dealing with its many problems, among them homelessness and a punishing cost of living.\n\nIn her San Francisco speech last month, she said the nation was witnessing a “wholesale abandonment” of American ideals under Trump.\n\nThe contest to replace Newsom in California is crowded, with leading candidates including former U.S. Rep. Katie Porter, former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former Biden administration health secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nIt’s expected that at least some of her rival Democrats would bow out rather than compete against her, including Porter, who in 2012 was appointed by then-attorney general Harris to be the state’s independent bank monitor in a multibillion-dollar nationwide mortgage settlement. \n\nDemocratic consultant Roger Salazar, who was a delegate in the party’s 2024 presidential convention, said Harris would stand better odds in a race for governor in her home state.\n\nWith multiple election wins in California, “there is just more certainty,” Salazar said. “I think she’s got a leg up right now, but this race hasn’t solidified” with the primary more than a year away.\n\nHow will voters view her? As a favorite daughter of California returning home? Or a two-time presidential also-ran looking for a soft landing? \n\nRepublican consultant Kevin Madden, who was a senior adviser to Mitt Romney’s presidential campaigns in 2008 and 2012, was dubious about her chances in either race. It's unusual for a candidate to capture the presidency after two losses — Biden was one example.\n\nAs for governor, “the California electorate is about as ideal as it gets for Harris, but nothing about her current electoral record indicates that primary or general election candidates should be scared off,” Madden added. \n\nUnlike many other states, California doesn't automatically advance a Democrat and a Republican to the November election. \n\nThe state’s open primary system has tormented many candidates — critics call it the “jungle primary.” All candidates appear on a single ballot, regardless of party, and the top two vote-getters advance to the general election.\n\nThe system can lead to strategic gambles. Last year’s U.S. Senate race included three prominent Democrats — U.S. Reps. Adam Schiff, Porter and Barbara Lee. Schiff ran TV ads in the primary that spotlighted Republican Steve Garvey, presumably a weaker contender in the general election than either of his Democratic rivals. Garvey ended up advancing to November, where he was soundly defeated by Schiff, who now holds the seat.\n\nBut Harris could come out of the June 2, 2026, primary facing a Democrat who ends up criticizing her in much the same way she'd have faced in a 2028 bid.\n\nSan Francisco-based Democratic consultant Eric Jaye recalled another Californian who, after losing a presidential race, sought to rebound in his home state: Richard Nixon. After being narrowly defeated in the 1960 election by then-Sen. John F. Kennedy, Nixon lost the 1962 race for California governor. (Of course, Nixon ended up winning the White House six years later.)\n\nWhile Harris is a favorite with Democrats, a slice of the electorate has deeply negative views of her, Jaye noted. That doesn’t leave her with many voters to gain, and the Democratic primary vote could be divided among multiple candidates.\n\n“I don’t think it’s in any way guaranteed that she would win,” Jaye said. “She’s a highly polarizing figure.”\n\nHarris would be coming home to a long list of problems.\n\nThe homeless crisis is playing out daily on the streets of Los Angeles and other big cities. Newsom this month said the state is facing a $12 billion deficit and he wants to freeze enrollment in a state-funded health care program for immigrants living in California without legal status. There is a home insurance crisis and a continuing threat from destructive wildfires.\n\nAnd as the last election made clear, Republicans will attempt to saddle her — fairly or not — with her home state’s reputation for confiscatory taxes, gas prices and utility bills, seven-figure home prices and liberal social policies.","summary":"After a bitter loss to President Donald Trump, former Vice President Kamala Harris is thinking hard about her next job","url":"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/kamala-harris-run-california-governor-bypass-white-house-122068531","image":"https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/1c6f5d84-8ea0-490c-ace7-d605fc8ae6e8/wirestory_6d3b5bef946b9c51c8096328865d3a84_16x9.jpg?w=1600","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 12:36:55","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.068},{"id":323711486,"title":"‘Uncharted’ territory: Journalist Chris Whipple talks on power, politics and Biden ahead of Saturday lecture in Berkshires","text":"Acclaimed author and journalist Chris Whipple will speak at the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center in Great Barrington this Saturday at 5 p.m. as the 2025 Mona Sherman Memorial Lecturer, presented by The Osher Lifelong Learning Institute at Berkshire Community College.\n\nWhipple will be discussing \"Uncharted: How Trump Beat Biden, Harris, and the Odds in the Wildest Campaign in History\" (Harper Collins Publishers, 2025), his insider account of the tumultuous 2024 presidential election. The book follows Whipple’s bestselling works “The Gatekeepers” and “The Spymasters.”\n\nIn a candid Eagle Reels vodcast with host Dalton Delan, Whipple describes President Joe Biden’s team as delusional and out of touch, and Donald Trump as unchanged, energized and politically cunning. Whipple critiques the Democratic Party’s failure to confront Biden’s limitations and notes Kamala Harris’s short runway to the nomination. \n\nAdmission to the lecture is free, but ticket reservations are required through the Mahaiwe box office, by calling 413-528-0100 or by registering online at mahaiwe.org. Following the lecture, OLLI will offer copies of “Uncharted” for purchase, and Whipple will sign books on site.\n\nThe Mona Sherman Memorial Lecture is named in honor of the late Mona Sherman, a passionate OLLI member and community leader whose legacy lives on through thought-provoking public programming. \n\nThe interview, a portion of which is below, was conducted before news broke of President Biden's cancer diagnosis.\n\nDALTON DELAN: Your book, “Uncharted,” puts us in the room for the 2024 presidential campaign. You're giving the Mona Sherman Memorial Lecture at the Mahaiwe on Saturday.\n\nCHRIS WHIPPLE: I'm thrilled and honored. I'll be talking about that wild 2024 presidential election, which was even wilder behind closed doors.\n\nDELAN: You describe Joe Biden as “fatigued, befuddled and disengaged.” It becomes clear in the book that Biden wasn't the only one asleep at the wheel. Some of your big sources, Ron Klain and others, seem somnolent at best and possibly delusional.\n\nWHIPPLE: No question about it. Unlike a couple of other books that are out there, this was not a classic cover-up in the Watergate sense, in which everybody was in on a conspiracy. The striking thing about my book and the mystery at the heart of it is the unbelievable extent to which Joe Biden and his inner circle were caught in this fog of delusion and denial. They believed what they wanted to believe. Prior to the debate, Ron Klain paints this devastating portrait of how Biden was out of it. Then the debate itself, which was just an unmitigated disaster. Everybody knew that it was game over for Joe Biden about 12 minutes in — everybody except Biden's inner circle. That's the extraordinary thing.\n\nDELAN: In your book, back in 2016, you’ve got Trump “preaching a potent brew of populist nativism, resentment, and conspiracy theories.” I was thinking back to “All the King’s Men.” There's something pretty American about it.\n\nWHIPPLE: Think about George Wallace in 1972. One of the fascinating ways in which history did not rhyme in this case, is the fact that after George Wallace was nearly assassinated and crippled from the waist down in a wheelchair, he had a kind of conversion. He forswore his previous racism and opposition to integration, and changed. Trump, not so much, after his near-assassination. For a while, he was saying he would be a changed man at the convention, but not at all. He's the same guy. He does have this feral genius for campaigning, there's no doubt about it. Governing, maybe not so much. \n\nDELAN: You describe Trump as addicted to “money, power and fame.” He took that bullet to the ear, but he'd already talked in a way that was messianic about himself. Unlike George Wallace, it just seems to solidify that.\n\nWHIPPLE: No question, that escape from the assassin's bullet, when he pulled himself up off that stage with blood on his cheek, raised his fist in the air and mouthed “Fight, fight, fight.” Think of the devastating split-screen here between him and Joe Biden as he came back from California with COVID. He stepped out of Air Force One onto those steps and looked lost, grasping the handrail. You couldn't have devised a more devastating contrast between strength and weakness. Trump went into that convention and it became a coronation. A lot of people thought it was God's will that he would be president.\n\nDELAN: You describe the 2022 midterms as locking the ticket in place. You predicted in Vanity Fair that Biden would head the ticket. I was writing in The Berkshire Eagle before the April 25, 2023, bid that he needed to step away. Nobody was listening.\n\nWHIPPLE: Obviously you were ahead of me. But the thing is that the 2022 midterms were so effective for the Democrats, they defied expectations and did so much better than anyone predicted. I remember that night, sometime after 1 a.m., I got an email from Ron Klain, the White House chief of staff, that said maybe we don't suck the way people thought. They were ecstatic. And Nancy Pelosi, among others, was for Biden running for reelection before she was against it, to use that famous phrase, because of the 2022 midterms. So many Democrats were on board, even though 77 percent of the American people, at that point, thought he was too old to run.\n\nDELAN: I wrote a column addressed as an open letter to the first lady, Jill Biden. I was begging the Dems not to nominate Harris. I knew it would be disastrous. She wasn't a change candidate. She didn't separate herself. \n\nWHIPPLE: Did you get a reply from Jill Biden?\n\nDELAN: I did not.\n\nWHIPPLE: This was an across-the-board abdication of leadership, a failure that started within Biden's inner circle, but extended through the entire Democratic Party. Everybody was told, if you run against Biden, you weaken him, and he loses to Trump, your career is over. That was the message that went out, at least implicitly. The result was Kamala Harris with a shortened runway of 107 days. I'm not ready to say you couldn't have won that race, but it was a difficult challenge.\n\nDELAN: Despite G-man James Comey’s timing with Hillary, and Biden's late exit, is the elephant in the room that America, unlike Europe, isn't ready to elect a woman president?\n\nWHIPPLE: That could well be the case. Misogyny and racism clearly play a part in this election. It's unquantifiable, so I don't write a lot about that factor. I wrote about the things Kamala Harris had some control over that that might give her a chance, but there's nothing she could have done to buck that tide. We all know it's out there.\n\nDELAN: If the Dems had taken on the progressive wing and put in Joe Manchin or John Fetterman, with a country moving to the middle, could a conservative Democrat have won?\n\nWHIPPLE: I think that had Joe Biden stepped aside a year or two earlier, had there been a really competitive nomination, a centrist candidate might well have emerged. Think of Bill Clinton in ’92, and his tacking to the center. It's also possible with a longer runway that nominee could make more mistakes. So we will never know. But is it possible? Sure.\n\nDELAN: We've now got real uncertainty in financial markets, and we know the midterms often flip over pocketbook issues. Can you give us a gut feeling about the midterms?\n\nWHIPPLE: Midterms, historically, are often — Obama used the word — \"shellackings\". They are usually not pleasant for the incumbent president and his party. I don't see any reason why 2026 will be any different.\n\nDELAN: The book is a mystery. Even if everything isn't solved, there are things in life that seem insoluble. If there's one thing you'd like us to take away from the book, what is it?\n\nWHIPPLE: What I would want them to take away is at the end of the day, what makes it such an unbelievable story — Shakespearian with its twists and turns and betrayals — is the fact that it ultimately ends in tragedy. Joe Biden had an opportunity to be a consequential president. He pulled the economy out of freefall. He managed the pandemic. He passed more bipartisan legislation than any president since LBJ. He created 17 million jobs. He rallied NATO to face down Putin. Yet his story ends in tragedy, because of this tragic flaw that he could not come to grips with giving up power. His eleventh-hour abdication, which left Kamala Harris with too short a runway to compete, is going to be his legacy.","summary":"Acclaimed author and journalist Chris Whipple will speak at the Mahaiwe Performing Arts Center on May 24 as the 2025 Mona Sherman Memorial Lecturer, discussing Uncharted, his insider account of the tumultuous 2024 presidential election.

They’ll cry “no evidence,” and you want to ask them if they actually spent any time searching for evidence. It’s their way of suggesting the story is too disreputable to pursue, like Hunter Biden’s laptop.\n\nOn the “PBS News Hour” on May 19, the term was “unfounded.” Republicans are “pouncing” on the news that former President Joe Biden has an aggressive case of prostate cancer. PBS anchor Amna Nawaz lamented: “Donald Trump Jr. has posted online, claiming that the diagnosis here was part of a wider cover-up around Mr. Biden’s health. He’s also repeating unfounded claims that Biden clearly had dementia.”\n\nHere’s what the president’s son tweeted: “The Dem-Media is trying to cover up the cover-up over Biden’s failing health—Which was obvious to anyone with a functioning brain—Because they know it implicates all of them.”\n\nIt’s not “unfounded” to claim that the media cooperated in shaming and suppressing Biden’s cognitive decline.\n\nThe online headline for Nawaz’s lament focused on the end of the Monday night pundit segment, which focused on President Donald Trump: “Tamara Keith and Amy Walter on the battle over Trump’s ‘big, beautiful bill.'” It looks like they couldn’t “ruin” the homepage with Biden skepticism in the headline.\n\nThe U-word was repeated. NPR White House correspondent Tamara Keith added: “President Trump himself has now also made unfounded claims about how President Biden must have known that he had cancer long before this was made public.”\n\nNawaz and Keith made no time for Democrat Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel’s comments on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that the advanced stage of Biden’s cancer strongly suggests that he had cancer throughout his presidency. Are MSNBC and the Democrat doctor guilty of “unfounded claims”? Why can’t they spend 24 hours looking into this story before making knee-jerk denunciations?\n\nNPR’s homepage offered a similar headline: “Trump suggests without evidence that Biden delayed sharing his cancer diagnosis.” The story began: “President Trump suggested without evidence on Monday that former President Joe Biden had delayed sharing his prostate cancer diagnosis.”\n\nPBS and NPR would never air stories suggesting “Joe Biden/Kamala Harris suggested without evidence that Donald Trump is a fascist.” Or in the current moment, they didn’t report “Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz made the unfounded charge that ICE agents are ‘Trump’s modern-day Gestapo.'”\n\nInstead, when Harris agreed on Charlamagne Tha God’s radio show last October that Trump is a fascist, PBS brought on Trump-despising professor Ruth Ben-Ghiat for a story headlined “Trump ramps up his dangerous political rhetoric in final weeks of campaign.”\n\nIt’s apparently not “dangerous” to compare Trump to fascist dictators after two assassination attempts.\n\nIn that story, PBS reporter Laura Barron-Lopez even platformed Harris attacking Trump for a lack of transparency! Harris said: “He refuses to release his medical records. I have done it. Every other presidential—every other presidential candidate in the modern era has done it. He is unwilling to do a ’60 Minutes’ interview, like every other major party candidate has done for more than half a century.”\n\nAfter press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre agreed two weeks later that Biden saw Trump as a fascist, PBS brought on Ben-Ghiat again for a segment headlined “How Trump’s rhetoric compares to historic fascist language.” In the liberal bubble of “public broadcasting,” this smear is never “unfounded.” Over and over with Trump, it sounds like the “PBS Pounce Hour.”\n\nThe notion that Trump-supporting taxpayers have to turn over their hard-earned money for these transparently partisan “public media” outlets never stops being an outrage.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM\n\nWe publish a variety of perspectives.

Both had the same caption that read:“When Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift took the stage together, it wasn't just a duet — it was a statement. As the two icons stood shoulder to shoulder, the arena erupted in thunderous applause, drowning out the noise of viral criticism that had trailed them online.”The Facebook posts that earned thousands of views, reactions, and comments were accompanied by images of Springsteen and Swift, performing onstage, on separate occasions.However, the now-viral claim is fake. Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift have not performed at a concert together in recent times, nor is there a scheduled show where the duo is set to share the stage.The fact-check website Snopes also debunked the rumor on May 21, 2025, and rated the claim as “false.” Moreover, no major news outlet has reported on such a high-profile concert where The Boss did a show with the Lover songstress.Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift did not recently perform togetherThe Facebook posts by Rock N’ Roll Mania and Rock & Roll Universe shared a false narrative claiming Bruce Springsteen recently performed at a concert with Taylor Swift.“Backed by the full force of the U.S. Musicians Union, who declared their ‘solidarity’ with the artists, this moment became about more than music — it was about unity, defiance, and respect for artistry,” the caption of the posts read.It continued, “Fans wept, cheered, and held up signs reading ‘We Stand With You,’ turning the performance into a powerful rebuke of negativity. In that electric moment, Swift and Springsteen didn't just sing — they roared back with grace, grit, and soul...”According to Snopes, both posts are fabricated, seemingly for virality. Also, the Rock & Roll Universe page is currently unavailable on Facebook.Meanwhile, the affiliated websites, newsanchor360 and karkpost, that came along with the posts, redirected to advertisements, unrelated pages, or repetitive content, lacking any authentic source or credible evidence to support the rumor.Additionally, the images in the posts do not depict a real concert where the duo shared the stage. Instead, they show Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift performing on separate occasions during their tours.Donald Trump posts about Bruce Springsteen. (Image via X)As per Snopes, one photograph showed the Blank Space singer performing in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in November 2023. Meanwhile, images of the E Street Band member were from his concerts held in November 2022 and April 2023.The posts also did not provide the “full video” evidence of the alleged concert, as mentioned in the caption, nor did the affiliated websites. Instead, they had clips of Bruce Springsteen performing at his ongoing Land of Hopes and Dreams Tour and those of Taylor Swift from her bygone Eras Tour.One clip even showed Taylor Swift live performing a rendition of Bruce Springsteen’s 1984 hit single, Dancing in the Dark from his second studio album, Born in the USA.Furthermore, Snopes called the Facebook accounts from where the viral claim originated as misleading, which often uploaded factually incorrect and AI-generated content of famous musicians.While Springsteen and Swift may not have performed together recently, they have long shared a mutual admiration. They have also been a longtime and vocal critic of Donald Trump and his administration.Exploring Taylor Swift and Bruce Springsteen’s feud with Donald TrumpAhead of the 2020 presidential election, Taylor Swift took to X and called out Donald Trump. At the time, she wrote:\"After stoking the fires of white supremacy and racism your entire presidency, you have the nerve to feign moral superiority before threatening violence?

We will vote you out in November.\"Likewise, before the 2024 election, the Midnight artist endorsed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz via Instagram, while indirectly condemning Donald Trump and JD Vance.Donald Trump, too, has been a longtime critic of Taylor Swift. Over the years, he has posted clickbait images and videos of and with her. In September 2024, POTUS said he is “not a Taylor Swift fan” and later that same month claimed he “hated” her.Following Swift’s appearance at the 2025 Super Bowl, Trump made fun of her and her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs’ star, Travis Kelce. He doubled down on it in April this year during a White House speech.Earlier this month, Donald Trump went viral for calling the Grammy winner “no longer HOT” on a Truth Social post. However, Taylor hasn’t responded to the same yet.Donald Trump posts about Taylor Swift. (Image via X)As for Bruce Springsteen, he, too, faced the ire of the POTUS after he endorsed Harris-Walz in the 2024 election. However, most recently in May 2025, the rock star criticized Trump as “unfit” and his government as “rogue,” during his Manchester concerts on May 14 and 17.“In my home, the America I love, the America I've written about, that has been a beacon of hope and liberty for 250 years, is currently in the hands of a corrupt, incompetent, and treasonous administration,” Bruce stated.He added, “Tonight, we ask all who believe in democracy and the best of our American experiment to rise with us, raise your voices against authoritarianism and let freedom ring!”Donald Trump responded twice via Truth Social. In the May 16 post, he called Springsteen \"a pushy, obnoxious JERK\" and a \"dried out ‘prune’ of a rocker (his skin is all atrophied).\" He also warned the musician to keep his mouth shut in the future.On May 19, POTUS doubled down on his backlash of Bruce Springsteen. He insinuated that Kamala Harris paid the artist for his “poor performance” at her election campaign last year, and warned him and other musicians like Beyonce and Bono of consequences.In the wake of these back-and-forth, American Federation of Musicians labor union, of which both Swift and Springsteen are members, offered their solidarity.A May 16 statement was posted on the AFM website that read:“The American Federation of Musicians of the United States and Canada will not remain silent as two of our members—Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift—are singled out and personally attacked by the President of the United States.”The statement called the artists “not just brilliant musicians,” but also “role models and inspirations to millions of people in the United States and across the world.”“Whether it's Born in the USA or the Eras Tour, their music is timeless, impactful, and has deep cultural meaning. Musicians have the right to freedom of expression, and we stand in solidarity with all our members,” it ended.Musician Neil Young also showed his support for Swift and Springsteen, and other celebrities under attack by Trump. Meanwhile, Kid Rock called them out and stood by the POTUS.","summary":"A rumor surfaced recently that musicians Bruce Springsteen and Taylor Swift performed together seemingly as a protest against U.S. President Donald Trump’s latest criticism of the duo.","url":"https://www.sportskeeda.com/us/music/did-bruce-springsteen-taylor-swift-perform-concert-together-response-trump-s-criticism-viral-claim-explored","image":"https://staticg.sportskeeda.com/editor/2025/05/9dbe3-17479094324258-1920.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 11:16:33","author":"Pallavi Kanungo","authors":["Pallavi Kanungo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.186},{"id":323678866,"title":"Shooting in Washington, DC leaves two Israeli diplomats dead and more top headlines","text":"Good morning and welcome to Fox News’ morning newsletter, Fox News First.

See 'Let’s Make a Deal.' The super game show host masquerading as a President is seeking ratings, approval and recognition….As it should be. Or not. Trump continues to play at being the star of the show, and in keeping with the entertainment format and media logic that got him his start, continues to strive to be the dominant personality of the world. \n\nIt is Trump’s understanding of “pocketbook voting” in the most literal sense (which includes turning the White House into a personal ATM for himself, his family, and inner circle) that may secure his and the MAGA movement’s hold over American politics for the foreseeable future. \n\nDuring his first term in office, Donald Trump made sure to put his name on the COVID relief checks that were sent to the American people. In a country where most Americans do not have $1,000 in case of an emergency, these COVID relief checks were a literal lifeline. These checks also created a personal connection between Donald Trump and the tens of millions of low-information and undecided voters who ultimately decided the outcome of the 2024 election. In contrast, President Biden made a choice not to sign the COVID relief checks that were sent out during the first term of his presidency. Moreover, Biden promised the American people $2,000 in relief money and then reneged (the final check was $1,400). Biden was punished at the polls for this choice, which was one of many errors in that sunk his electoral fortunes and those of Kamala Harris and the Democrats.\n\nNow Trump and his MAGA Republicans in Congress are continuing with the “Trump bucks” strategy. As part of Trump's “Big Beautiful Bill” that is being forced through the Republican-controlled Congress (which is most certainly not “beautiful” for the American people as it takes hundreds of billions of dollars away from the neediest Americans and gives it to the very rich and corporations) the newest ploy is a proposed $1,000 in the form of “MAGA saving accounts” for children.\n\nBusiness Insider reports:\n\nThe \"big, beautiful bill\" that aligns with President Donald Trump's broader economic agenda and was unveiled by House Republicans on Monday includes a so-called \"MAGA\" savings accounts for kids.\nWithin the bill's draft is the creation of \"Money account for growth and advancement\" accounts, or \"MAGA accounts,\" laying out a pilot program to launch the accounts with $1,000 each.\nGOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas recently talked about the plan with Semafor after he pushed the idea to his fellow Republicans as they attended a party retreat earlier this month.\n\"The case I made to my colleagues is: We should ask ourselves in this bill, what will be the legacy that people will remember and talk about 10 years from now, 20, 30, 40 years from now?\" Cruz said at the time.\nIn the House bill, the item is listed as the \"MAGA Accounts Contribution Pilot Program.\" The plan would give parents with a qualifying child a \"one-time credit of $1,000\" that'd be payable into the child's account.\nTo be eligible for the program, the child must be a US citizen \"at birth,\" possess a Social Security number, and have a birthdate after December 31, 2024, and prior to January 1, 2029.\nIn the House bill's draft, the MAGA accounts are specified as being \"exempt from taxation.\"\n\nIf enacted beyond the pilot program, the MAGA savings accounts would be extended to children born before 2024 and who are under eight years old.\n\nTrump and his MAGA Republicans’ “MAGA accounts” are a version of the “baby bond” program that Democrats, liberals and progressives have long supported in various forms. The right wing generally opposed such a program as “wasteful spending,” “socialism,” and “government handouts.” \n\nIn a conversation with Semafor, Sen. Ted Cruz explained how he views the difference between \"MAGA accounts\" and the Democratic Party's \"baby bonds\": “\n\nThat is just a government program, where this is very much designed to get the next generation to invest in the market.\n You see a lot of young people who in public opinion surveys, say they have a negative view of capitalism and they embrace socialism....And what is powerful about this is, when every child has invested, it’s no longer an abstract idea.\n\nIt will be very difficult for an already ineffective and uncoordinated Democratic Party and its spokespeople to oppose these new “Trump bucks.” The most obvious challenge is that the Democrats will be accused of being “anti-family” and against “family values” and that they must hate children. The Republicans and the right-wing disinformation machine and echo chamber have spent decades branding the Democrats in that way.\n\nDonald Trump and his Republican Party will also use “MAGA accounts” to summon up the zombie idea of “compassionate conservatism,” even though the American right has spent decades expanding and amplifying the culture of cruelty and a Terrordome that is now growing even faster under Trump’s direction.\n\nIn a new essay at the LA Progressive, social theorist Henry Giroux warns, \"We are not witnessing a temporary crisis. We are witnessing collapse: of public institutions, civic imagination, and the ethical vocabulary that once made collective life thinkable. Neoliberalism, far from dead, has mutated into a violent form of capitalist necropolitics or neoliberal fascism, one that celebrates greed, rewards cruelty, and administers violence and death in slow and spectacular forms.\"\n\nThe Democrats will likely make the correct intervention that “MAGA accounts” are a distraction and bait-and-switch trick because they are a paltry substitute as compared to the hundreds of billions of dollars that the Republicans are cutting away from healthcare, education, food and housing assistance, the social safety net, science, protecting the environment, and other investments in the country and its well-being that offer much larger tangible benefits for children and young people and the American people as a whole.\n\nUnfortunately for the Democrats, decades of political science and other research show that the American voter is not sophisticated. Their political decision-making is largely made in response to emotions, messaging and storytelling, more than a sophisticated understanding of facts and public policy. In total, the average American voter tends to be imagistic, emotional and biased towards immediacy and the short-term in their political decision-making. “Trump bucks” in their various forms are a tangible incentive to support Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.\n\nAs seen with the right-wing lie that millions of “illegal aliens” are receiving Medicaid, MAGA savings accounts will also serve as another attack point in the Trump administration’s racist and nativist campaign to end birthright citizenship and the 14th Amendment. Per this argument, “if we are going to give $1,000 to children and families, then we need to make sure it is going to 'real Americans' and not 'illegals!’”\n\nThe Democrats and others who correctly see these MAGA saving accounts and other examples of “Trump bucks” as a ploy and long con that takes advantage of the American’s people’s economic desperation (and shortsightedness and lack of political sophistication) will likely protest that “MAGA savings accounts” are divisive and polarizing because they are not named something “unifying” and “tasteful” like “baby bonds” or “a child saving’s bond”. As the Democrats should have learned in 2016, “When they go low, we go high!” is not a winning political strategy or messaging. Politeness, moral superiority, and principles are no substitute for $1,000 when so many Americans exist in such a financially precarious state.\n\nWant a daily wrap-up of all the news and commentary Salon has to offer? Subscribe to our morning newsletter, Crash Course.\n\nThe potential for more “Trump bucks” to do substantial damage to the Democrats is reinforced by political consultant Stanley B. Greenberg’s new article in The American Prospect about the Democratic Party’s doomed 2024 presidential campaign(s) and the role of message discipline and branding in that defeat:\n\nIt was emblematic of the entire campaign: unable to focus on the most obvious line of attack, switched between different campaigns, did not battle to win each day, and allowed the opponent to score many free hits. Harris did indeed benefit immensely from her launch, the Democratic convention, and debate. But then it fell apart. In my post-election poll, the top reasons to vote for Harris were to save democracy and stop fascism and to save the Affordable Care Act—not the issues that were at the top of voters’ minds.\nAnd after she lost, Biden said he would have won.\nFor the past 15 years, the great working-class majority has heard Democratic presidents and nominees praise the American economy. Along with the mainstream media and economists, they cheer it as “the envy of the world.”\nDid our leader notice that the great majority have been largely treading water or worse for 25 years? The top 0.1 percent and 1 percent and 5 percent are devouring a growing share of income and especially wealth. At the same time, the obscene wealth of billionaires gives them tremendous political influence….\nDemocrats can learn from that moment when Harris was poised to win. She was for the middle class, mainstream on cultural issues, and pushing clearly and consistently for economic and political change.\n\nWhatever the state of the economy and the country’s political life in 2026 and 2028 (it is a huge assumption that there will even be “free and fair” elections as the Trump administration expands its autocratic reach), the American people will be asking the respective candidates “What have you done for me lately?” and then saying, “Show me the money!”\n\nThe New York Times reports that Wednesday night, House Republicans changed the name of these proposed \"MAGA Accounts\" to make the connection between Donald Trump and this money even more explicit and undeniable. In the most recent version of Trump's \"big beautiful bill,\" the $1,000 will now be deposited in a \"Trump account.\"\n\nThe Times adds, \"Under the bill, children born between Jan., 1, 2025, and Jan. 1, 2029, would receive the money, which would be invested on their behalf in financial markets. Once they had grown up, they could withdraw the proceeds to pay for certain expenses, including going to college or buying a house. The child’s parents, or other third parties, could also contribute to the account. While the benefit of the $1,000 initial investment from the government is clear, the accounts have otherwise puzzled tax experts.\"\n\nDemocrats need a concrete plan with clear deliverables if they want to take back power and begin to do the extremely difficult work of slowing down and eventually stopping Trumpism and the larger American (and global) authoritarian movement.","summary":"MAGA savings accounts are no substitute for hundreds of billions of dollars the GOP wants to take away from kids","url":"https://www.salon.com/2025/05/22/expand-trump-bucks-scheme-with-maga-savings-accounts/","image":"https://mediaproxy.salon.com/width/1200/height/675/<?= https://media2.salon.com/2024/01/donald_trump_money_cash_dollar_1246337799_1483245388.jpg ?>","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-05-22 10:10:07","author":"Chauncey Devega","authors":["Chauncey Devega"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.121}]}
