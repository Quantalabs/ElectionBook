The longtime U.S. foe has supported groups that have killed Americans across the Mideast and threatens to destroy Israel. But Trump’s public flirtation with joining Israel’s offensive against Iran may become the Democratic Party’s latest schism, just as it is sharply dividing Trump’s isolationist “Make America Great Again” base from more hawkish conservatives.\n\nWhile progressives have staked out clear opposition to Trump’s potential actions, the party leadership is playing the safer ground of demanding a role for Congress before Trump could use force against Iran. Many prominent Democrats with 2028 presidential aspirations are staying silent, so far, on the Israel-Iran war.\n\n“They are sort of hedging their bets,” said Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of state who served under Democratic President Barack Obama and is now a strategist on foreign policy. “The beasts of the Democratic Party’s constituencies right now are so hostile to Israel’s war in Gaza that it’s really difficult to come out looking like one would corroborate an unauthorized war that supports Israel without blowback.”\n\nProgressive Democrats use Trump’s ideas and words\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., has called Trump’s consideration of an attack “a defining moment for our party” and has introduced legislation with Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., that calls on the Republican president to “terminate” the use of U.S. armed forces against Iran unless “explicitly authorized” by a declaration of war from Congress.\n\nKhanna used Trump’s own campaign arguments of putting American interests first when the congressman spoke to Theo Von, a comedian who has been supportive of the president and is popular in the “manosphere.”\n\n“That’s going to cost this country a lot of money that should be being spent here at home,” said Khanna, who is said to be among the many Democrats eyeing the party’s 2028 primary.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination, pointed to Trump’s stated goal during his inaugural speech of being known as “a peacemaker and a unifier.”\n\n“Very fine words. Trump should remember them today. Supporting Netanyahu’s war against Iran would be a catastrophic mistake,” Sanders said about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nSanders has reintroduced legislation prohibiting the use of federal money for force against Iran, insisted that U.S. military intervention would be unwise and illegal and accused Israel of striking unprovoked. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York signed on to a similar bill from Sanders in 2020, but he is so far holding off this time.\n\nSome believe the party should stake out a clear anti-war stance as Trump weighs whether to launch a military offensive that is seemingly counter to the anti-interventionism he promised during his 2024 campaign.\n\n“The leaders of the Democratic Party need to step up and loudly oppose war with Iran and demand a vote in Congress,” said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama aide, on X.\n\nMainstream Democrats are cautious, while critical\n\nThe staunch support from the Democratic administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for Israel’s war against Hamas loomed over the party’s White House ticket in 2024, even with the criticism of Israel’s handling of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. Trump exploited the divisions to make inroads with Arab American voters and Orthodox Jews on his way back to the White House.\n\nToday, the Israel-Iran war is the latest test for a party struggling to repair its coalition before next year’s midterm elections and the quick-to-follow kickoff to the 2028 presidential race. Bridging the divide between an activist base that is skeptical of foreign interventions and already critical of U.S. support for Israel and more traditional Democrats and independents who make up a sizable, if not always vocal, voting bloc.\n\nIn a statement after Israel’s first strikes, Schumer said Israel has a right to defend itself and “the United States’ commitment to Israel’s security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran’s response.”\n\nSen. Jacky Rosen, D-Nev., was also cautious in responding to the Israeli action and said “the U.S. must continue to stand with Israel, as it has for decades, at this dangerous moment.”\n\n“It really seems like the Trump and Iran war track is kind of going along like a Formula 1 racetrack, and then the Democrats are in some sort of tricycle or something trying to keep up,” said Ryan Costello, a policy director for the Washington-based National Iranian American Council, which advocates for diplomatic engagement between U.S. and Iran.\n\nOther Democrats have condemned Israel’s strikes and accused Netanyahu of sabotaging nuclear talks with Iran. They are reminding the public that Trump withdrew in 2018 from a nuclear agreement that limited Tehran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions negotiated during the Obama administration.\n\n“Trump created the problem,” said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., on X. “The single reason Iran was so close to obtaining a nuclear weapon is that Trump destroyed the diplomatic agreement that put major, verifiable constraints on their nuclear program.”\n\nThe progressives’ pushback\n\nA Pearson Institute/Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from September 2024 found that about half of Democrats said the U.S. was being “too supportive” of Israel and about 4 in 10 said their level support was “about right.” Democrats were more likely than independents and Republicans to say the Israeli government had “a lot” of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas.\n\nAbout 6 in 10 Democrats and half of Republicans felt Iran was an adversary with whom the U.S. was in conflict.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Yassamin Ansari, an Iranian American from Arizona, said Iranians are unwitting victims in the conflict because there aren’t shelters or infrastructure to protect civilians from targeted missiles as there are in Israel.\n\n“The Iranian people are not the regime, and they should not be punished for its actions,” Ansari posted on X, while criticizing Trump for fomenting fear among the Iranian population. “The Iranian people deserve freedom from the barbaric regime, and Israelis deserve security.”\n\nAssociated Press writers Mary Clare Jalonick and Linley Sanders in Washington contributed to this report","summary":"Trump’s public flirtation with joining Israel’s offensive against Iran may become the Democratic Party’s latest schism.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/06/21/democrats-are-at-odds-over-the-israel-iran-war-as-trump-considers-intervening/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Mideast_Wars_Democrats_36197-1.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 23:37:08","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.046},{"id":333857036,"title":"Mark Cuban Turned Down the Offer When Asked to Submit to be Kamala Harris’ Vice President in 2024 Presidential Election: ‘I’m Not Very Good as the Number Two Person’","text":"During a recent appearance on “The Bulwark” podcast, Mark Cuban revealed he was invited to submit himself for consideration to become former Vice President Kamala Harris‘ running mate in the 2024 presidential election.

Then The New York Times’s, er, heart-throbbing excuse for a news item over crown prince Alex’s wedding to corrupt former Hillary Clinton aide and disgraced former Congressman Anthony Weiner’s ex-wife Huma Abedin could probably serve as Exhibit A.\n\nTimes writer Tammy LaGorce spent a whopping 2,010 words trying to twist the union of two of the most notorious people in American politics into some kind of fairy tale. “Alex Soros and Huma Abedin Share Their Love Story and Wedding,” read LaGorce’s cringe headline.\n\nLaGorce then profiled their entire relationship story with so much sensationalist puffery it was enough to jump-start a good retching: “Each knew of the other for years, but it took an intense conversation at a party in 2023 — plus a missed DM, a text chain, many more texts, phone calls and the Doha Forum — to set a dinner date.” What is this, high school? \n\nThe newspaper enthusiastically highlighted the A-list Democrats who were in attendance, including Abedin’s old boss Hillary and her husband former President Bill Clinton. This was particularly awkward, given that The Times and other liberal outlets had refused to report on a cringey photo showing President Clinton officiating Abedin’s previous wedding to Weiner, which was uncannily embarrassing given the juxtaposition of the two remarkably similar, cheating men. Other guests of Alex and Huma included former Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff; Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY). \n\nLaGorce didn’t bother to mention anything about Abedin’s role in her former boss’s egregious email server scandal, the mishandling of classified information, and potential conflict of interest with the Clinton Foundation. And why bother when she was too busy making Abedin out to be a Disney princess awaiting her radical Prince Charming:\n\nFor Saturday’s ceremony, Ms. Abedin, who is now legally Huma Abedin Soros, wore an off-the-shoulder ivory Givenchy gown with a slim belt designed by Sarah Burton. Mr. Soros wore a Dior tuxedo that he mentioned was not new, because his favorite clothes tend to be well-made pieces he has hung onto for years.\n\nLaGorce propagandized that Soros’s “fashion philosophy matches his attitude about waiting to find the perfect woman to marry.”\n\n A match made in hell for sure. MRC Business discovered in previous reports that the Soros machine had given at least $131 million to control and influence over 250 media organizations around the world to spread its radical agenda on abortion, Marxist economics, anti-Americanism, defunding the police, environmental extremism and LGBT fanaticism. Apparently, The Times is currying favor with this media empire by giving Alex some free PR.\n\nMRC Business also just released a new investigation in coordination with the Bongino Report highlighting how the Soros machine under both George and Alex allocated at least a whopping $618,895,617 collectively between 2016 and 2024 toward exploiting the issue of climate change alone to reshape the world into an eco-utopia. \n\nOne thing’s for sure, as The Times nauseatingly implied: Alex seems to have found his de facto Queen of the Soros Empire. Yikes.","summary":"Need more evidence to prove how much influence the Soros empire wields over the media?

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on social media over her characterization of why drug prices are so high for Americans compared to the rest of the world. \n\n“Big Pharma companies like Johnson & Johnson and Pfizer charge Americans the highest drug prices in the WORLD while often paying ZERO dollars in federal taxes themselves. Why? Because our tax system is rigged. Now, Republicans want to make it worse. I’m fighting back,” the Massachusetts senator posted on X and linked below it to a CNBC piece about the legislator’s grilling of drug company executives. \n\nThe Shark Tank star who recently left the show after 15 seasons was sharp in his response to the progressive senator.\n\n“No. It’s because PBMs [pharmacy benefit managers] corrupt health care,” he said on X. \n\nPharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs for short, are third-party administrators of drug prescriptions who negotiate between the groups that pay for the drugs, drugmakers, and pharmacies. They have become the target of increasingly bipartisan regulation.\n\n“Big Pharma wishes they could set their own pricing. They don’t. PBMs control formularies and manipulate prices, in exchange for providing pharma access to patients. It’s how they maximize rebate revenue,” Cuban continued.\n\n“In fact, 3 PBMs NEGOTIATE MORE THAN 90% OF REBATES for commercial insurance plans. That’s your area of expertise, and you have done nothing,” the billionaire concluded. \n\nAccording to a 2024 report from the Federal Trade Commission, “the three largest PBMs now manage nearly 80% of all prescriptions filled in the United States.”\n\nThe president’s son, Trump Jr., then jumped into the debate.\n\n“Didn’t think I’d be RTing Mark for a while, but he’s 100% right on this issue,” Trump Jr. said. \n\n“Agreed,” Silicon Valley venture capitalist Joe Lonsdale added. \n\nIn April, Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders signed into law first of its kind legislation, which banned PBMs from also owning, managing, or controlling pharmacies licensed in the state of Arkansas. \n\n“For far too long, drug middlemen called PBMs have taken advantage of lax regulations to abuse customers, inflate drug prices, and cut off access to critical medications. Not anymore,” Sanders said in a press statement released for the signing. \n\n“Pharmacy benefit managers can still operate in our state; they just can’t continue to mistreat patients and box out other pharmacies,” Sanders added in an op-ed. \n\nThe Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, a trade organization that represents major PBMs, promptly sued the state over the law.\n\n“Our lawsuit aims to protect patients in Arkansas from the implementation of this dangerous, misguided policy. If implemented, the Arkansas legislation mandating forced closures of pharmacies would have a devastating impact on patient access to critical medications and pharmacy services,” the association said in a press statement. \n\nSanders, a Republican who served as White House press secretary during the first Trump administration, attributed the successful passage of the law to the elder Trump holding office now. \n\n“If you’d asked me a year ago if we could change these entrenched interests, I’m not sure I would have thought it possible. But with President [Donald] Trump in office, everything is changing,” the governor explained. \n\nIndeed, the president has promised to “cut out the middlemen,” and he may get his chance if Congress holds steady and includes provisions to regulate PBMs in the budget reconciliation bill. \n\nOne proposed provision would seek to regulate spread pricing, the practice of a PBM charging “payers like Medicaid more than they pay the pharmacy for a medication.”\n\nThe provision would prohibit the ability to claim federal matching funds for spread pricing where “the PBM charges the state or a managed care organization an amount for the dispensing of a drug that exceeds the amount paid to the pharmacies or providers, net of all pricing concessions,” according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.","summary":"Donald Trump Jr. expressed agreement with Kamala Harris supporter Mark Cuban on X yesterday on the issue of combating high drug prices.&#160; Cuban critiqued Sen....

One of life’s small cruelties is that when one acts responsibly and strongly, as Trump has here, they tend not to get credit for the bad things that don’t happen. But we should make an exception for the miracle of the Rio Grande. LIBERAL NEWS OUTLET MOCKED FOR REPORTING ON ‘MYSTERIOUS’ DROP IN FENTANYL FLOWING ACROSS BORDER What there can be absolutely no doubt about is that, somewhere this weekend at a cookout or a bowling alley, there are people enjoying their friends and family who would not be here but for Trump’s border actions. The numbers are simply stunning, almost to the point of Monty Python-level absurdity. In May of 2024, 62,000 illegal migrants were released into the U.S. Last month that number was zero, zilch, nada. Likewise, back when Grandpa Joe Biden was running the show, there were often over 10,000 encounters a day on the southern border, but last Sunday, there were a total of 95, the lowest number ever recorded over 24 hours. To put this in perspective, you could put 95 people in two Waffle House restaurants with room at the counter to spare. It is fair to say that this remarkable closing of the open wound that was flooding our nation with millions of illegal migrants as well as fentanyl and targets of terrorist watchlists, is among the most complete and swiftest handlings of a crisis in American history. If Kamala Harris was in office today, a million illegals could have come in by now. How many gang members? How many rapists? How many deadly doses of fentanyl? Let us not forget how vociferously we were informed that what Trump has done, shutting down the border, was absolutely impossible without acts of Congress. In the giant gumball machine of lies told by the Biden administration, this was among the most stale. It goes back even further than Biden’s incompetence. While Trump had surely tamped down illegal immigration in his first term, before that, Barack Obama, George W. Bush, and Bill Clinton, had all failed to get a handle on the situation. Part of the problem years ago, and still an issue in Trump’s deportation policies, is that some industries, like farming and hospitality, rely heavily on illegal labor. But given that there are already 10-20 million illegals in America, thanks to Biden, we certainly don’t need any more. And the ongoing deportations, which polling consistently shows voters approve of, also play a role in securing the southern border. When one sees people being arrested for jumping the turnstile, it makes them less likely to try it themselves. Deportations turn off the magnet that attracts migrants, and by ending the disastrous catch-and-release policy, Trump has freed our border agents, to actually enforce border security instead of being desk clerks at the Hotel America. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, fentanyl seizures at the southern border are down 50% since November. A huge part of the reason for this is that without the cover of 100,000 illegal migrants a day, smuggling drugs gets much, much harder. Less fentanyl coming into the country means fewer Americans dying of overdoses, a result that surely everyone should cheer.

We certainly are not used to it, but we would be wise not to take it for granted. With the border closed, a million people self-deporting and violent criminals being taken off the streets and out of the country, there will be fewer grieving parents with children lost to violence, fewer grieving children with parents lost to illegal driving. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Just six months into his second stint on Pennsylvania Avenue, Trump’s secure border is already making every American, of every party, much, much safer. In 2020, American voters took Trump’s first-term hard work on the border for granted, and by electing Biden opened the floodgates to millions. This time, let's understand and appreciate how important a secure border is, and make clear that we are never going back.

This is not an accident, it is increasingly by design.\n\nOn Tuesday the decriminalisation of abortion up to birth amendment to the Crime and Policing Bill laid down by Labour Gower MP Tonia Antoniazzi won by 379 to 137.\n\nOf this 291 Labour MPs voted in favour and just 25 against while 63 Lib Dems were in favour and just two against.\n\nOn the other side 92 Tory MPs voted against and just four in favour. Another four abstained by voting in both lobbies. No Reform MPs supported and four voted against.\n\nThe split is not as stark on Friday’s assisted dying vote but nevertheless reveals a trend.\n\nKim Leadbeater’s bill had the support of 224 fellow Labour MPs with 160 against and 56 Lib Dems with 15 against.\n\nOn the other side the Tories split 92 against to 20 in favour while Reform were three against and two in favour.\n\nKemi Badenoch put a two line whip on the abortion vote rather than allowing a completely free vote. This indicated a party position without the threat of disciplinary action which would come with a three line whip. But, remarkably, after the abortion vote senior Tories were complaining that Ms Badenoch had not withdrawn the whip of the four MPs who voted for decriminalisation.\n\nThe last time the UK saw Parliament vote on such seismic social change was back in 1967 with Liberal MP David Steel’s abortion legislation and Labour MP Leo Abse’s Sexual Offences Act which decriminalised homosexuality.\n\nIn both those cases parties split down the middle on conscience votes which saw the odd alliance of rightwing Tory MP Enoch Powell and leftwing Labour MP Tony Benn coming together to support legalising homosexuality.\n\nThe erosion of the conscience vote in the UK has actually come more from a hardening of positions from progressive leftwing parties in Britain and exacerbated by the so-called culture wars.\n\nIn 2012 Ed Miliband imposed a three-line whip on gay marriage on Labour MPs. LGBTQ+ matters ended there as something of individual conscience for the first time. \n\nThen in 2019 former MP Roger Godsiff was dropped as a Labour candidate for supporting parents in his Birmingham constituency who were protesting over primary school children being taught about same-sex relationships.\n\nThis year we see Reform UK banning LGBTQ+ flags from county halls where they have taken control of the council and attempting to purge councils of diversity, equity and inclusion officers and policies.\n\nWhile abortion officially remained a matter of conscience a comment by the now home secretary Yvette Cooper in 2017 about Jacob Rees-Mogg being unfit to be a party leader because of his views on abortion was enlightening.\n\nWhat has happened over a number of years is that the majority of socially conservative, mostly Catholic tradition in Labour has been removed through selection processes.\n\nAn ongoing legal case involving the Liberal Democrats and one of its former candidates has highlighted an apparent major shift in British politics to the party politicisation of conscience issues.\n\nFormer BBC journalist David Campanale was kicked out as the candidate for Sutton ahead of the last election because, he claims, of his Christian beliefs. \n\nAccording to documents presented in the case, Luke Taylor, who replaced him as the candidate, is alleged to have claimed that “the party of past prominent Liberal Democrats with Christian beliefs, such as Shirley Williams and Charles Kennedy, was ‘over’, and that he and others were building a ‘secular party’ which would have no place for Christians expecting to “hold to their religious or conscientious opinions”.\n\nMr Taylor was the teller for the votes in favour of the abortion amendment on Tuesday, who also described the assisted dying vote, which he supported, as a good way to “neatly bookend the week.”\n\nIf Mr Campanale wins his case it will for the first time provide evidence that selection is taking place on conscience issues as well as other matters.\n\nThe Lib Dems have denied the claims and pointed out that their leader Sr Ed Davey goes to church. But the Christian Lib Dems including former deputy leader Simon Hughes have voiced concerns and the party has been condemned by two bishops. and a former Archbishop of Canterbury. Added to that Tim Farron, who voted against abortion and assisted dying last week, was ousted as leader over his Christian beliefs in 2017.\n\nDuring the assisted dying vote a number of supporters of the bill suggested that religious belief had no place in deciding such issues. A real departure from conscience.\n\nBut a brand of conservatism is emerging in the UK which openly embraces traditional Christian values.\n\nReflecting on the assisted dying vote, Tory MP Danny Kruger, a leading opponent of the bill, said: “If we are to withstand our enemies, bring our society together, and tame the technium (somehow ensure that human values govern the new age of machines), we are going to need values that are up to the job. \n\n“I don't think humanist atheism or progressive liberalism or whatever the new religion should be called, is up to it. Christianity is. Only Christianity is.”\n\nIn America, the conscience vote rapidly became more party-politicised as a result of the Roe vs Wade abortion ruling in in 1973. Social conservatives gradually began to take over the Republicans on the right and social progressives the Democrats.\n\nIt has played out ferociously in the selection of Supreme Court justices, who recently in effect overturned Roe v Wade with a conservative majority.\n\nThe most interesting US development is the way that a man like Donald Trump, previously ambiguous over abortion, has adopted a strong anti-abortion line to please his base.\n\nThis played out in the 2022 midterms to the detriment of the Republicans with the Democrats using the threat to abortion rights to great effect. But it did little to help Kamala Harris in 2024.\n\nWhat that shows though is that parties with very strong views one way or the other can be elected largely on economic grounds but bring with them a great deal of baggage on conscience issues. After this week some would argue the same thing has happened in the opposite direction in the UK.","summary":"Votes on abortion and assisted death suggest the UK is on the cusp of a major shift - issues once determined by MPs’ individual conscience are becoming American-style party political matters, political editor David Maddox writes","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/assisted-dying-vote-dignitas-mps-b2774368.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/06/20/14/97db884c5bf44f448377eb6d2eb19fbfY29udGVudHNlYXJjaGFwaSwxNzUwNDMzMDg1-2.80710980.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/LP8WZ7EN-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-21 13:51:37","author":"David Maddox","authors":["David Maddox"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.006},{"id":333782754,"title":"How the Zohran Mamdani Campaign Is Changing Influencer Culture","text":"If elections were decided by the internet’s views on sex appeal, New York Democratic mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani would already be living in Gracie Mansion.

Should a beauty influencer have a nuanced take on starvation in Gaza? If a sketch comedy star doesn’t post about the ICE raids, does it matter if he goes to IRL protests? To make things more complicated, popular New York influencers have been criticized for years for promoting a fictional version of the city, one that prioritizes ease for transplants while ignoring the ongoing struggle of working class residents. Now, their comment sections are filled with demands for them to speak out about the mayoral race. As the Trump administration continues to make decisions that are shaking the foundations of America’s democracy, people online are turning to things they can still change — like the New York mayoral election — and expanding the current understanding of influencer expectations in the process. \n\n Learning from Democrats’ mistakes \n\n If there was a lesson to take from former Vice President Kamala Harris’ loss to Trump in the 2024 presidential election, it’s that social media movements need to be organic to work. Even the short term social media push from Harris’ campaign — which included key collabs and endorsements from dozens of the most popular digital creators, celebrities, and influencers — couldn’t get Harris the votes she needed. But the Mamdani campaign has been heralded by New York voters and viewers alike for his people-first approach to digital marketing. He’s appeared on fan favorite talk shows like Gaydar, Subway Takes, streamed with Twitch star Hasan Piker, even appeared at an MJ Lenderman concert. Videos with influencers, celebs, and those in between are posted side by side with explanations of his platforms and responses to breaking news. When New York comptroller and fellow mayoral candidate Brad Lander was taken into ICE custody this week while escorting a defendant out of immigration court, Mamdani stood alongside Lander’s wife and protested the arrest. \n\n But while Mamdani’s online presence has been celebrated for its diversity, New York influencers have been lambasted for a lack thereof. Last March, a month-long discourse broke out over city-based, largely white influencers being “boring as fuck” — posting the same outfits, expensive dinners, and $10,000-a-month apartments to their followers. Carla Davis, a content creator and native New Yorker covering local New York politics, tells Rolling Stone that there’s been a big “pressure campaign” for NYC influencers to speak on the mayoral race because it’s an election that feels like “lives and the soul of the city” are on the line. And if the girlies have time to post about must-try restaurants or fabulous nights out, why can’t they also post about the election? \n\n “The New York City influencer is a poor representation of this beautifully diverse city,” Davis says. “But unfortunately, it is a mirror of the shifting demographics here, where we’re seeing Black, brown and working class New Yorkers be priced out of their homes and neighborhoods, and entire communities with deep roots and beautiful cultural histories be replaced by more affluent newcomers.” \n\n For Davis, it’s this framework that explains why so many audiences are now directly demanding their favorite New York influencers post: You can use this city as a backdrop, as long as you use your platform to help make it better for the people who live in it. \n\n “It seems like the least that you can do is use your influence for good, and speaking about the election specifically, encouraging your audience to vote should really be the bare minimum,” she says. “This is not just a place I’m passing through, or an era in my life. This is my home.” \n\n Rachel Gaede, a 25-year-old transplant and content creator who lives in Manhattan, has been building an online presence since 2020 and has close to half a million followers on TikTok alone. Her most popular videos revolve around lifestyle content like her family dog Roddis, her sister, and her parents — whom she documented Parent Trap-ing during the 2020 lockdown. (Her parents got remarried in December 2023, an event she celebrated on TikTok.) But several of her recent videos have focused on the mayoral race, including telling her audience how to check their voter registration, canvassing for Mamdami, and advocating for people to leave Cuomo off their ballots entirely. She tells Rolling Stone that while sharing politics online can feel “sticky,” the widespread damage of the Trump administration has made it easier to speak out without getting accused of straying from your lane. \n\n “Sometimes it can get confusing when you post a political video and then a purse haul. But at the same time everything is political now. Father’s Day was literally yesterday and it’s not a political holiday. But it felt political because I’m privileged enough to be a person that didn’t get my dad ripped away from me based on the status of his immigration papers,” Gaede says. “So having [your opinion] mixed in content that’s usually silly or lifestyle is OK, because it’s still helping you reach a larger audience and connect with people that might have not originally come to your page for politics.” \n\n Lifestyle gets political \n\n Lifestyle creators in particular have seen the most movement toward political content this year. Lifestyle can cover everything from dating, drama, entertainment, gossip, fashion, style, and cultural commentary to reaction videos and hotel reviews. It’s also known as “the most lucrative niche online,” according to author and creator Eli Rallo, because there are no bounds. You are your content, so when influencers post to their followers, while clothes or books or Amazon purchases might be available, what they’re really selling is themselves. And with the increasing pressure for influencers to post about the race, it seems that while the definition of lifestyle influencing is widening, people are starting to expect political beliefs in the mix as well. \n\n “With the second Trump presidency, people are having to make a conscious decision as to whether or not they’re going to bring politics into their platform. There’s a very contentious discourse around it,” Rallo says. “But to me, it was an abhorrent idea to be selling myself and my ideas on the internet, but also not platforming things that mattered to me and things that were happening right outside my window.” Rallo has been posting about everything from Broadway to books to Black Lives Matter protests since 2020. But she decided to post about the New York mayoral race because of how much content she makes in the city — and the high transplant audience she could reach with just one video — even though she spends half the year in Texas, where she is registered to vote. \n\n “I’m a Cancer, but I get so emotional,” she says. “I couldn’t imagine sitting here in New York City and not telling you to go vote and what matters to me about this place.” \n\n For many creators, none of the choices seem like good options. Remaining neutral also can’t protect creators from backlash. In early May, Kate Mackz, an influencer and host of the Running Interview Show, dealt with a torrent of backlash after posting a conversation with White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. Critics accused of betraying the liberal followers she gained by supporting the Harris campaign. Anthony Po, YouTuber and the creator of the Timothee Chalamet lookalike contest, tells Rolling Stone he doesn’t think politics and social media have a one size fits all solution. “The worst thing you can be on the internet, and unfortunately it’s what most people are, is an absolutist. There’s nuance in every conversation and it’s totally a case by case basis,” he says. “But why would we want the [Costco Guys’] political take? If you are the type of person whose media diet would come from watching A.J. and Big Justice’s [Instagram] story, you have bigger issues that you need to come to terms with.” But the Jersey City-based creator hosted a Mamdani lookalike event with the group HotGirls4Zohran — posting the results and amplifying Zohran’s campaign messaging because he felt like it could possibly make a real difference in who showed up to vote — and who decides to post in the future. \n\n “I try to make my content so people have a place to escape. But there’s no negatives to posting Zohran,” Po says. “The only people that stand any right to be upset with me are billionaires and incredibly rich real estate owners in the city. So it’s like, what do I have to lose?” \n\n With Great (And Online) Power \n\n Social media users don’t even have to search Mamdami’s name to see a deluge of social media content about the mayoral candidate. But what’s been surprising about this race is just how many previously apolitical creators have endorsed the candidate outright. Jake Shroeder, a 23-year-old creator based in Brooklyn, posts videos putting personal anecdotes to piano chords. (The most popular? A summer ditty containing the lyrics, “When I drink Sauvignon Blanc I dive into a luscious funk.”) He doesn’t consider his content political, but he can’t deny the sheer power of viewership. Adweek data for cable news brands in May 2025 shows declining viewership for the top channels, with the highest viewership (Fox News) still under 3 million at any given primetime minute. For liberal leaning shows, that number shrinks significantly, around 1 million for MSNBC and 558,000 for CNN. In comparison, Shroeder, who only has 175,000 followers on Tiktok, says he can easily end up with 6 million views or more before the end of a good week. \n\n “The voice of the influencer is underestimated,” Schroeder says. “It’s a lot of power and responsibility but it should be used to make a better world. This world is shitty and needs a lot of actionable change. Instead of a post about losing my AirPods, why not a post [about] voting for Zohran?” \n\n The reason why this New York mayoral race seems to be landing differently online is most likely because influencers are asking for a specific action (voting for Mamdani) rather than general awareness. The New York mayoral election has given this usually vibe-based problem a tangible focus. Influencers don’t have to reinvent political alternatives or even pretend to solve decades long problems. They just have to get people to vote for someone who wants to try. According to city data, only 23 percent of New Yorkers voted in the 2021 mayoral election. Mayor Eric Adams only won the primary by 7,197 votes. These influencers reach millions every single day. And as the lead between Cuomo and Mamdani continues to shrink, many creators believe their posts could get their New York followers to vote — possibly for the first time. \n\n “I have a large transplant audience on my account, and speaking to them has been really important to me, because that’s a huge voter block,” Gaede says. “There are so many people that are in New York and choose to leave their voter registrations in the states where they’ve moved from. So representing the hope and the excitement of this election has been really important to me, because I feel like that’s how you get people to show up.”","summary":"Excitement around the New York City mayoral candidate has creators everywhere rethinking their relationship to politics","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/zohran-mamdani-influencer-culture-1235368766/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/zohran-nyc-mayoral-race-influencers.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 13:30:00","author":"Ct Jones,Elisabeth Garber-Paul","authors":["Ct Jones","Elisabeth Garber-Paul"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.095},{"id":333747484,"title":"What would victory look like for Israel over Iran?","text":"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the three goals of the war are “the elimination of the nuclear program, the elimination of ballistic missile production capability, and the elimination of the axis of terrorism,” referring to Iranian-backed militant groups in the Middle East. \n\nIran has carried out repeated iterations of ballistic missile fires targeting Israel, and, even with Israel’s extensive air defenses, a handful have gotten through and hit civilian areas. But Iran’s attacks have trended smaller as the war reaches its one-week mark, leading experts to believe its stockpiles and launchers could be diminishing quickly.\n\nUS involvement\n\nIran’s capabilities haven’t been completely destroyed yet, and there are concerns that Israel’s military doesn’t have the weaponry required to destroy Iran’s most hardened nuclear facility, Fordow, which is embedded in the base of a mountain. \n\nPresident Donald Trump said on Wednesday the U.S. would be “the only ones capable of doing it, but that doesn’t mean we are going to be doing it at all.”\n\nHe is weighing whether the U.S. should intervene. In the days and hours before this very operation, the president publicly called for Israel to refrain from carrying it out, arguing that he still wanted to give diplomacy a chance to succeed.\n\nTrump has since downplayed his calls for diplomacy.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt relayed a message on Thursday from the president in which he said he will decide whether or not to join the war “within the next two weeks,” giving time for “a substantial chance of negotiations” to play out.\n\nVarious experts have different opinions on whether the U.S.’s most powerful “bunker-buster” bomb, known as the massive ordnance penetrator, or MOP, would be able to destroy the Fordow facility.\n\nThe 30,000-pound bomb is so heavy it can only be transported for deployment via the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber. No other country has the MOP, which is specifically designed to “accomplish a difficult, complicated mission of reaching and destroying our adversaries’ weapons of mass destruction located in well-protected facilities,” according to an Air Force fact sheet.\n\nIsrael could come up with innovative ways to damage the facility without U.S. support, though it would likely require special forces being there. That type of mission comes with its own set of risks.\n\nIf the nuclear facilities are damaged but not destroyed, Iran could restart the program in the future. The regime, fearing a threat to its existence, could also feel the pressure to make a dash toward a nuclear weapon now.\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard told lawmakers in March that the intelligence community “continues to assess that Iran is not building a nuclear weapon, and leader Khamenei has not authorized the nuclear weapons program that he suspended in 2003.” She added, “Iran’s enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a state without nuclear weapons.”\n\nIf the U.S. gets directly involved, Iran could target U.S. bases in the region, which Iran’s proxies have done more than a hundred times since the outbreak of the broader conflict on Oct. 7, 2023. Secretary of State Marco Rubio warned that if Iran fires at U.S. bases in the region prior to the U.S.’s direct involvement, it would retaliate.\n\nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned on Wednesday that any U.S. involvement in the war would be met with “irreparable damage.”\n\nIran has yet to target a U.S. base, though the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem was damaged. There are roughly 40,000 U.S. troops in the region, within striking distance of Iran.\n\nThree U.S. service members were killed and about 40 were injured in January 2024 in a militia’s drone attack on a military base in northeast Jordan, near the Syrian and Iraqi borders.\n\nRegime change\n\nNetanyahu did not identify the toppling of the Iranian government as a priority of Israel’s operations when they began, but Defense Minister Israel Katz threatened Khamenei on Thursday after an Iranian missile hit the Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba, saying he “absolutely should not continue to exist.”\n\n“The Prime Minister and I have instructed the IDF to increase the intensity of attacks against strategic targets in Iran and against government targets in Tehran in order to remove threats to the State of Israel and undermine the ayatollahs’ regime,” Katz added.\n\nTrump warned on Tuesday that the U.S. knew of his location and was choosing not to assassinate him. The thought of targeting Khamenei would have seemed unthinkable a mere two years ago, but Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attack changed Israel’s war calculations.\n\n“I fully acknowledge it’s uncertain what would come next, but it’s hard to imagine anything worse than the ayatollahs,” John Bolton, Trump’s former national security adviser, told the Washington Examiner. “And certainly if the nuclear program and the ballistic missile program had been effectively destroyed, and the Israelis have already eliminated a fair number of nuclear scientists at that point, it’s much more of an internal Iranian problem than it is a strategic threat to Israel or the Gulf Arab States or the United States, or anybody else.”\n\nIf the regime is overthrown, it’s unclear who will take over governance of the country, which has a population of roughly 90 million, and whether the next leaders will also have nuclear ambitions.\n\nPhil Gordon, who served as former Vice President Kamala Harris’s national security adviser, said on the Foreign Affairs podcast this week: “But, even when you get it done, like with the Taliban or Saddam Hussein in Iraq or Gaddafi in Libya, there is often a moment of ‘It worked, mission accomplished, we got rid of the terror regime,’ and that’s when the problems begin because you create a vacuum, and I would caution in this case, for all of those who have a goal of regime change in mind or think Israel is already on its way to victory, be careful what you wish for. Because I would say in this case, as in all previous cases, the most likely result of a regime change in Iran would not be a liberal, pro-West democracy that doesn’t want nuclear weapons.”\n\nThe concerns laid out by Gordon have been articulated by a bipartisan group of lawmakers who don’t support U.S. involvement in the war.\n\n“At best, it would be a version of the Iranian military, which would also have nationalist hard-line goals, at worst it’d be a vacuum that divides people ethnically, branches of the military, conflict pulls in neighbors, and we’ve seen that so often before, so I would say where the goal of regime change is concerned, be careful what you wish for,” he added. “There’s no guarantee that, especially if it’s gone at the hands of the Israeli military, it gets replaced by something better.”\n\nEven if Khamenei makes it out of the conflict alive, he will come out of it weaker than he’s ever been, and it comes on the heels of the destruction of both the Iranian nuclear program and its proxies, which the regime has poured “tens of billions, maybe hundreds of billions of dollars, over several decades” into, Bolton said.\n\nIn the aftermath of Hamas’s Oct. 7 terrorist attack, Israel has fundamentally changed the Middle East. Israeli forces have decimated Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, while Bashar Assad, an ally of Iran, had his regime toppled in Syria. The U.S. also engaged in a limited war against the Iran-backed, Yemen-based Houthis.\n\nIran had spent decades arming and financially supporting that network of proxies, often referred to as the “Axis of Resistance,” and had leaned on them to attack Israel so it could shield itself from an Israeli response. That is, until last week, when Israel launched its opening salvo in the first direct full-scale military confrontation between them. \n\nIsrael had always been aware of the possibility that Iran’s proxies would attack if it and Iran got into a direct conflict. However, Israel systematically defanged each of them ahead of its decision to go after Iran’s nuclear program, changing the equation.\n\n“In the last 18 months, you’ve seen Israel attain escalation dominance, and let me define what that means. That means the ability of the Israelis to control the pace, the intensity, the focus of their military activities against their three principal adversaries: Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran,” Aaron David Miller, a former longtime State Department Middle East official, told the Washington Examiner. \n\nTurning battlefield wins into political gains\n\nThe U.S. was pursuing Israel-Saudi normalization in the fall of 2023 before Hamas’s attack derailed those negotiations. About a week before Hamas’s attack, a White House official told reporters that a “basic framework” had been “hammered out,” showing just how close all sides were to implementing a historic deal, only for its collapse.\n\nThe effort for normalization was built upon the first Trump administration’s Abraham Accords, in which Israel and four Arab countries — Sudan, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Morocco — normalized ties.\n\nLast month, Trump outlined his long-term vision for U.S. relations in the Middle East during his first trip to the region since getting inaugurated for his second term, and it included bringing Saudi Arabia into the accords.\n\n“It’s my fervent hope, wish, and even my dream that Saudi Arabia — a place I have such respect for, especially over the last fairly short period of time, what you’ve been able to do — but will soon be joining the Abraham Accords,” Trump said in Riyadh. “I think it’ll be a tremendous tribute to your country, and it will be something that’s really going to be very important for the future of the Middle East.”\n\nOne of the primary hindrances to Saudi Arabia’s entrance into the accords, however, is the issue of Palestinian statehood. Its stance has only hardened during Israel’s war against Hamas in Gaza, amid a rising death toll and growing humanitarian concerns.\n\nIn September 2023, less than a month before Hamas’s attack, Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said, “We hope it will reach a place that it will ease the life of the Palestinians.” A year later, in September 2024, he gave a speech to the Shura Council, stating, “The kingdom will continue to work diligently toward the establishment of a Palestinian state with East Jerusalem as its capital and will not establish diplomatic relations with Israel without this condition being met.” \n\nThe Saudis’ demand for Palestinian statehood to be included in a normalization process is starkly opposed to Netanyahu’s view that statehood would amount to rewarding Hamas’s terrorist attack, the most deadly in Israel’s history.\n\nThe Israelis have not publicly articulated a clear plan for postwar Gaza, even though the war has gone on for roughly 20 months and Hamas has been severely degraded.\n\nTrump has described Gaza as “uninhabitable,” given the level of destruction Israel’s forces inflicted on the enclave. U.S. officials have said it could take more than a decade to complete the reconstruction of Gaza.\n\n“The question is, in the wake of this escalation, dominance, all of these conflicts, is it possible to foresee or envision political arrangements which are at most transactional, maybe partly transformational, I don’t know,” Miller added. “Saudi-Israeli normalization can’t be done without an end to the war in Gaza and a major move by the Israelis on the Palestinians. The Abraham Accords may broaden, but again, not if the war in Gaza continues, and not if there isn’t an alternative political process which gives the Arab states cover for something they’d probably like to do.”\n\nThe lack of a clear plan for Gaza limits the prospects for Israeli-Saudi relations but could be an indication of its view toward Iranian regime change.\n\n“You’ve got Israeli escalation dominance,” Miller continued. “You’ve got America riding that escalation dominance. What you don’t have from either the Israelis or the Trump administration is how to convert military power into political gain.”","summary":"Israel appears to be on the verge of a major victory in Iran.

Via surfing","text":"What do men want? Democrats need to know after their election drubbing by Donald Trump and the “manosphere” last year. They have responded by commissioning “Speaking with American Men”, a strategic plan that will study “the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality” in online spaces.\n\nNews of the two-year $20m project reinforced critics’ view that Democrats have become the party of an aloof, college-educated liberal elite whose pursuit of working class men resembles a Victorian explorer wielding a butterfly net. Which makes the publication of David Litt’s book, It’s Only Drowning, a timely contribution to Democrats’ ongoing post-mortem.\n\nLitt is a former senior speechwriter for Barack Obama dubbed “the comic muse for the president” for his work on White House Correspondents’ Association dinner monologues. The 38-year-old has written speeches and jokes for athletes, chief executives and philanthropists and was head writer and producer in the Washington office of the comedy studio Funny or Die.\n\nIt’s Only Drowning, his third book, centres on an improbable friendship that develops between Litt, a Yale-educated liberal with a fear of sharks, and his brother-in-law Matt Kappler, a tattooed truck driver who listens to podcaster Joe Rogan and never registered to vote.\n\nTheir chasmic differences in background, education, ideology and lifestyle initially seem unbridgeable but, when Litt asks Kappler to help him learn how to surf, the shared experience provides neutral ground for connection.\n\n“What started as a surfing book became a story about basically a will-they won’t-they?, except it’s whether an Obama speechwriter and a Joe Rogan superfan can become friends,” Litt says in an interview at the Guardian’s office in Washington. “Like a lot of Democrats, my natural inclination is to be a little annoying and condescending. I certainly wasn’t doing that when I was the one who desperately needed to learn from him.”\n\nLitt, who divides his time between Washington and Asbury Park, New Jersey, describes himself as a high-functioning, high-anxiety person who experienced situational depression during the coronavirus pandemic. He had a feeling of overwhelming dread, difficulty getting out of bed and found himself endlessly doomscrolling.\n\nHis wife Jacqui’s brother, by contrast, seemed to be thriving. Kappler is a guitar player, a motorcycle enthusiast and a daredevil surfer. Litt reflects: “I had always thought of him as a crazy person, and I still do, but he was able to deal with the ups and downs of life in a world that’s on fire in a way that I began to envy.\n\n“He did well during the pandemic and he seemed resilient in a way that, to be totally honest, I didn’t. I definitely was not about to get tattoos or try to drive a truck because I would bump into things, but I could see myself trying to surf and that’s what happened.”\n\nIt would not be easy. At the age of 35, it required developing new muscles and confronting intense fear and humiliation. Still, Litt moved to the Jersey Shore and enlisted Kappler to help with surfing lessons. After months of struggle, he set the ambitious goal of riding a big wave in Hawaii.\n\nSurfing became a metaphor for confronting fear, both physical and existential, and an antidote to Litt’s habitual overthinking. He says: “Weirdly, the feeling I get, that sense of dread when a wave is about to crash down right on top of me, is actually somewhat analogous to the feeling I get when reading the news these days. It’s that sense of looming disaster and there’s nothing you can do about it.”\n\nAnd most importantly, Litt came to consider Kappler a friend. “One of the only things more difficult than learning to surf is making a new friend in your 30s, so I feel like I might be even more proud that I was able to accomplish that than riding an overhead wave on the North Shore.”\n\nAs he tells this story, Litt reflects on America’s deep political and cultural divisions and how they were exacerbated by the pandemic. Differences in taste and lifestyle become “identifiers” declaring political allegiance. Litt admits that, had Kappler been a friend rather than family, he would probably have cut off contact after learning that Kappler refused the Covid shot.\n\n“He played electric guitar in a ska band that is a big deal on the Shore; I played ultimate frisbee. He was into death metal and I was into Stephen Sondheim. So we never had anything in common. In the run up to the pandemic all of these differences weren’t always political but then somehow they started to feel like they were telling us what team we were on. It felt like we’d been drafted into opposite sides of the culture war.”\n\nLitt does not pretend that there was a Hollywood ending in which he and Kappler found common ground and changed each other’s minds. But he does argue in favour of shared activities that allow for connection and understanding between individuals with differing views.\n\n“What we found was this neutral ground. Surfing is a space that is not politically coded and you can talk about something that isn’t one of the gazillion fault lines in our society right now. It’s hard to find those spaces but, for the exact same reason, it’s worth trying.\n\n“I heard from a lot of people in the run-up to this book coming out who said, ‘I have a friend or family member where politics is tearing us apart. We can’t talk about anything in the news and how do I convince them?’ What I would say now is talk about something else. Don’t talk about what’s in the news.\n\n“Start by looking for that neutral ground and forgetting about this idea of common ground, because the reason it feels like we have no common ground is that we don’t. We just disagree on a lot of important things as a society.”\n\nLitt knows that, had Kappler been registered to vote, he would certainly not have done so for Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. Back in 2016, Kappler said he would have backed either Trump or Bernie Sanders because they were the most entertaining.\n\nLitt says: “Truly the biggest divide between us politically is that I think about politics a lot and that’s part of how I define myself. Matt watches the news, he cares about what’s going on in the world, but that’s not his identity. He’s not a political person.\n\n“One of the problems that Democrats have right now is we’re very much the party of news junkies and most Americans are not news junkies.”\n\nCelebrity politics and cultural influence have moved towards Republicans and the likes of Rogan and Elon Musk, who appeal to anti-establishment sentiment and claim to prioritise common sense over political parties. A new generation of rightwing podcasters and influencers started out as entertainers and latched on to issues later.\n\n“Democrats are still lagging.” Litt says. ‘The new media voices that are developing, many of them are great, but they tend to be political first and entertainment second, or politics as entertainment, and so they don’t appeal as much to people who don’t find politics entertaining and those are the voters we’re going to need in ‘28.”\n\nDemocrats also have a well documented class problem. It has come to be seen by many as the party of Hollywood celebrities and college-educated elites, with a whiff of contempt for blue collar workers in the heartland, summed up by Hillary Clinton’s dismissal of half of Trump supporters as a “basket of deplorables.”\n\nThe party’s perceived shift toward identity politics and social justice issues alienated some working class voters who once formed its base. Ahead of the 2016 election, Senator Chuck Schumer declared: “For every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia.”\n\nIt turned out to be bad maths. Last November Republicans swept the White House and both chambers of Congress. Trump won 56% of voters without a college degree, compared with 42% who favoured Harris, a shift from 2020 when Trump and Joe Biden were roughly even.\n\nLitt points out the homogeneity of Democratic circles and the lack of organic relationships with working-class people, particularly those without college degrees. This disconnect hinders their ability to understand their issues or effectively communicate.\n\nRecalling his time volunteering for Harris’s ill-starred election campaign, he says: “I would sometimes be on conference calls and people would talk about a policy or message and say, ‘Do we think this is going to work? Do we think this is going to be effective?’ I would basically say, well, let me go surfing and find out.\n\n“Nobody else said, ‘Oh, let me go talk to my working class friend,’ because Democrats often do not have working friends who don’t have college degrees. The people who are in office, and the people who work for those who are in office, almost all are college educated and almost all their friends are college educated.\n\n“You have Democrats sit in rooms where literally everyone has a college degree, and they say, how come people without college degrees don’t feel like we’re thinking about them or that we’re welcoming to them? Well, look around the room.”\n\nLitt acknowledges that he is writing about a friendship with one other white man, the smallest possible sample size, making it hard to draw sociological conclusions about working class people of colour.\n\nBut he also notes that Republicans have sought to “repolarise” the country on educational and culture war lines while making race less important in determining how people vote. Polls show that Trump did make big inroads with Latino men and, to a lesser extent, with African American men.\n\nLitt says: “I don’t know that race stopped mattering but I do think there was a Democratic view that race mattered so much more than anything else, especially for people who are not white.\n\n“What we saw is very clearly no, that’s not true and was maybe not the most empirically based attitude to have. The base of the Democratic party is still Black women but I do think there was some some of that racial depolarisation.”\n\nDemocrats do have a strong policy agenda for blue collar workers but have failed to communicate it, Litt argues. His friendship with Kappler will not explain everything. But he offers it as a start for a party that somehow allowed Trump – a millionaire businessman who cuts taxes for the rich – to steal its clothes.\n\n“If you had asked me three years ago, do you have a lot to learn from your brother-in-law, I would have said not really, and one of the things I had to learn was that’s a deeply obnoxious attitude. I’m still a professional Democrat – I can still be plenty annoying – but I think I am less self-righteous than I used to be. And it turns out life is more fun and you’re more persuasive that way. So why not?”","summary":"David Litt’s new book It’s Only Drowning centres on an improbable friendship and how shared experience provides a neutral ground for connection\n\nWhat do men want? Democrats need to know after their election drubbing by Donald Trump and the “manosphere” last year. They have responded by commissioning “Speaking with American Men”, a strategic plan that will study “the syntax, language and content that gains attention and virality” in online spaces.\n\nNews of the two-year $20m project reinforced critics’ view that Democrats have become the party of an aloof, college-educated liberal elite whose pursuit of working class men resembles a Victorian explorer wielding a butterfly net.

Those with ties to big donors are wary of whether Martin can lead the party, as some influential DNC members, such as David Hogg, with ties to younger voters and labor unions, have quit.\n\nSince Martin took over, the DNC has drained its cash reserves by $1.8 million, records show. Meanwhile, the RNC’s cash on hand has grown by $27 million during the same period.\n\nThe DNC touted the fundraising numbers on Friday as something to celebrate, announcing it had raised roughly $40 million from individual contributions in the first four months of Martin’s leadership, more than any previous chairman in that time period. \n\n“This is only the start, but it’s a record-setting start that allows Democrats to meaningfully invest in every part of the country,” Martin said in a statement that didn’t address that the DNC has spent more than it has brought in May. “Let’s get back in the game, keep winning races across the ballot, beat the Republicans in Virginia and New Jersey, and then take back Congress in 2026.”\n\nThe fundraising numbers come as the party rebuilds after Kamala Harris and Joe Biden’s 2024 disappointments, and Democrats have begun to criticize Martin’s ability to lay out a vision ahead of the 2026 midterms.\n\nSome DNC members have complained that Martin looks “weak and whiny” in the struggle to contain the several disputes that have spilled into the public.\n\n“My basic feeling is that the DNC right now is a mess. I mean, there’s no question about it,” said Democratic strategist Brad Bannon.\n\nHogg, a former vice chairman for the group, accused Democratic leaders of having a “serious lack of vision” when he ultimately decided not to run for the leadership position after the DNC voted to void his election. \n\nThe Gen-Z activist’s efforts to primary elderly Democrats inflamed the party and ultimately led to a public rebuke from Martin. \n\nMartin also fretted in a leaked audio that Hogg’s actions had limited his ability to focus the party on rebuilding the Democratic Party’s public image.\n\nThen, Randi Weingarten, the influential leader of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, both quit the DNC over their disagreement with Martin’s leadership.\n\nBoth leaders, who supported Wisconsin’s Ben Wikler for the DNC chairman, were removed from the powerful Rules and Bylaws Committee by Martin and refused to continue as at-large DNC members. They also complained that Martin’s leadership was not widening the big-tent umbrella coalition the party needs to claw back power. \n\n“While I am a proud Democrat, I appear to be out of step with the leadership you are forging, and I do not want to be the one who keeps questioning why we are not enlarging our tent and actively trying to engage more and more of our community,” Weingarten wrote to Martin on June 5. \n\n“The decision to decline the nomination to the Democratic National Committee was not made lightly,” Saunders said in a statement to the Washington Examiner. “It comes after deep reflection and deliberate conversation about the path forward for our union and the working people we represent.” \n\nMartin, however, will have a new vice chairwoman after Shasti Conrad was elected on Friday, following the reelection of Malcolm Kenyatta as vice chairman, in the aftermath of the Hogg drama, which could help him begin to put his stamp on the DNC.\n\n“As an AAPI leader, I’m proud to represent America’s fastest-growing voting bloc and ensure we have a seat at every table where decisions are made,” said Conrad in a statement on Friday. “I’m ready to work side by side with Chair Martin and Democrats across the country to win elections and live up to the values we all share.”\n\nYet, Democrats are worried that their financial deficit compared to Republicans could hinder their ability to win future elections.\n\nOn Friday, Vice President JD Vance, the RNC finance chairman, traveled to Los Angeles, California. He attended a fundraiser for the organization during its summer retreat, according to an invitation obtained by the Washington Examiner.\n\nThe fundraiser charges $44,300 per photo with Vance and $88,600 per couple for a roundtable and photo with the vice president, another example of how the GOP is adding to its coffers after gaining control of the White House and Congress.\n\n“We have no clear path or plan,” one DNC member told the New York Post. “The midterms are going to come before we know it, and then we’re going to be really f****d.”\n\nInsiders told the New York Times that major donors have been reluctant to give to the DNC this year despite Martin’s solicitation and that party leaders have discussed borrowing money to pay its bills. \n\n“That’s certainly not our plan right now,” Martin told the paper about borrowing funds. “I don’t know if we’ll have to at this point.”\n\nEven Hogg, whose group Leaders We Deserve is investing $20 million in primarying senior Democrats, is facing some financial problems.\n\nThe group raised $848,088 in May, but spent $797,880, and has $1.5 million cash on hand, according to data compiled by Rob Pyers, research director at California Target Book.\n\nOther DNC members acknowledged that money has become a problem now that they are shut out of power.\n\n“The DNC is no different than any other ally groups out there,” said John Verdejo, a North Carolina DNC member. “There’s many ally Democratic-leaning groups right now, starving for money right now since Trump’s election.”\n\n“Big Democratic donors are holding on to their purses right now, just looking to see where things go,” he continued. “And this tends to happen when you’re the losing party. There’s a period where the money’s not flowing as much as it used to.” \n\nAdding to Martin’s problems is that Harris raised a historic $1 billion in just three months of running for president, but reportedly finished the campaign with $20 million in debt, which could deter donors from opening their wallets again.\n\nVerdejo said donors from the last cycle who are keeping up with the barrage of negative press surrounding the DNC may be cautioning Martin “to clean house first” before they cut a check.\n\nIn April, Martin also announced a $1 million monthly investment from the DNC in all 50 state parties to help them rebuild before the 2026 and 2028 elections. However, the program is also adding further strain to the party’s financial resources.\n\n“Martin has to make a case that he’ll make better use of [money] than the previous regime did in 2024 because … I think a lot of donors are gun-shy,” Bannon added.\n\nA recent poll backs up Bannon’s assertion. According to a Reuters-Ipsos poll, 62% of Democrats said it was time for new leadership, with only 24% saying the party should keep current leadership in place.\n\nMany Democrats have pushed the DNC to move away from distracting fights to focus more on fighting Trump’s efforts to muscle through his reconciliation bill, crack down on sanctuary cities, and steamroll Washington.\n\nSunjay Muralitharan, president of the College Democrats of America and a DNC member, described the internal drama as “minor, personality squabbles.”\n\n“Everyone has their own personal opinion of what direction the party should be in. I think everyone is entitled to that opinion,” Muralitharan said. He claimed it would be hard for Martin or any one leader to create the big-tent party structure Democrats have been known for in the past.\n\nMartin’s supporters point to his work traveling to nearly two dozen states and leading the party to victory in flipping red seats during special elections in Nebraska, Wisconsin, Iowa, and Pennsylvania as an example of how effective the chairman has been despite his struggles. \n\nDemocrats also don’t appear keen on pushing out Martin anytime soon.\n\n“I will say it’s too early to say that it’s time for him to step aside. He just got elected in February. It is now June,” said Douglas Wilson, a Democratic strategist in North Carolina. “What I will say, though, is that the party has to figure out a way to stop airing out internal debates in the open.”\n\nPublic leaks will continue to weaken Martin in the eyes of the public and donors, leading to more disastrous problems, the strategist cautioned.\n\n“One, you lose support and the confidence of the base, two, you lose the confidence of the donor class, and then three, the voters feel that you don’t have your house in order,” he continued. “So, how can we put you back in power?”\n\nRon Harris, a Minnesota DNC member and chairman of the DNC Midwestern caucus, claimed that Martin’s past leadership of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party gave him the experience to navigate the complicated problems he faces.\n\n“Having been a party chair for 15 years or so in Minnesota, he’s seen his fair share of internal dynamics leaking to the public,” Harris said. “He’s been on the other end of mean accusations and people trying to throw dirt on his name or get in his way, so he’s more than prepared to sort of navigate this.” \n\nDEMOCRATS BRUSH OFF INTRA-DNC SQUABBLES AS ‘BRUISED EGOS’ AND ‘MINUSCULE’\n\nDemocrats are looking for progress soon. \n\n“I’m willing to give him some leeway so he has time to get his act together, but he better do it soon,” said Bannon. “He better do it quickly, because the Hogg fight was a distraction. The departure of Weingarten and Saunders are great losses. So he better get going and get going fast.”","summary":"Democratic National Committee&#160;Chairman Ken Martin&#8217;s rocky tenure hit another bump with the release of fundraising numbers for the organization, which has struggled to regain its foothold after President&#160;Donald Trump&#8216;s victory in the 2024 election.

However, this perception doesn’t reflect the growing reality in many parts of the country, where political competition at the local level is being replaced by a strong allegiance to a single party.\n\nIn recent years, counties that Republicans were winning by 20 points at the start of the 21st century are now seeing margins of 50 points or greater. Concurrently, the number of counties that switch allegiances between parties during each presidential election cycle has diminished.\n\nAccording to data collected by the NBC News Political Unit, demographic trends have clearly defined our current political groups. Additionally, geographical trends highlight the extent to which this reorganization has concentrated along community lines over the past 25 years. It’s becoming increasingly common for individuals to have political discussions only within their own echo chambers, as the political clustering in the United States has made it more feasible than ever to avoid opposing views. \n\nLooking at blowout county wins\n\nGeorge W. Bush’s Electoral College win in 2000 was famously razor-thin. But his average win across the country’s 3,100-plus counties was about 17 points. Democrats’ advantage in population-dense urban cores bolsters their popular vote count election after election. But Republicans’ advantage in rural counties has been a core part of the Republican playbook, with small-county wins with margins of 50 points or more adding up, bit by bit, to a substantial coalition. These were the counties where each candidate had 50-plus-point-margin wins in the 2000 election:\n\nBush captured major wins across the Plains states and up through the Mountain West, while Al Gore racked up margins of 50-plus points in the densely populated New York City boroughs, Philadelphia, Baltimore and some scattered rural areas with large Black populations.\n\nBut more than two decades later, President Donald Trump has dramatically expanded the number of blowout win counties.\n\nTrump has grown Republican political advantages east of the older GOP bulwarks and has captured Appalachia, which was once a reliably Democratic region, continuing to drive up margins in rural America. The average size of a Trump blowout county was about 10,000 voters last year. On the flip side, Democrats have grown their advantages in population-dense cities and suburbs, with the San Francisco Bay Area; Portland, Oregon; and Seattle emerging on this map as heavily Democratic areas. The average size of a blowout county for Kamala Harris was 210,000 voters. \n\nSome of the most important political coalitions for Democrats emerge on this map, especially in comparison with 2000. The 2024 map shows the birth of Democratic vote powerhouses in majority-Black DeKalb and Clayton counties in Georgia and in Wisconsin’s Dane County, home of Madison and the University of Wisconsin, with its heavily white and college degree-holding population. Both coalitions are essential to Democratic wins in those states in recent elections.\n\nOverall, there are four times as many blowout counties today than there were at the turn of the century.\n\nCounties flipped\n\nOne consequence of the sharp rise in blowout counties: a precipitous decline in swing counties.\n\nBack in the 2004 election, 227 counties flipped from one party to the other compared with the 2000 election. But last fall, only 89 changed their party preferences from the 2020 election.\n\nThe total number of flipped counties has dropped over the century. The biggest spikes occurred in the 2008 first-term election of Barack Obama and the 2016 first-term election of Trump — moments when the party coalitions changed dramatically.\n\nTrump’s 89-county flip in this last election was actually an increase over the 80 counties that flipped in Joe Biden’s victory in 2020. The last election was also statistically notable for another reason: Harris became the first candidate this century who didn’t flip a single county compared with the previous election.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe United States might seem like a nation evenly split between Republican&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: The Impact of Rapidly Expanding ‘Blowout Counties’ on U.S. Politics first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/the-impact-of-rapidly-expanding-blowout-counties-on-u-s-politics/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/What-the-explosive-growth-of-039blowout-counties039-means-for-US.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 10:05:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.393},{"id":333701820,"title":"Israel-Iran Conflict: Live Updates: Israel and Iran Trade New Strikes on 9th Day of War","text":"Speaking directly to the camera, Ms. Gabbard warned that the threat of nuclear war remained. “As we stand here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before,” she said, “political elites and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tension between nuclear powers.”\n\nMr. Trump berated Ms. Gabbard for the video, according to two people briefed on the conversation. He said that her discussion of nuclear annihilation would scare people and that officials should not talk about it.\n\nMr. Trump’s displeasure with the video laid bare months of his skepticism of Ms. Gabbard and frustrations with her. The president and some administration officials viewed her overseas travel, as the video exemplified, as being as much about self-promotion of her political career as it was about the business of government, multiple officials said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal dynamics of the administration.\n\nBut the tensions surrounding Ms. Gabbard are now in the open, as Mr. Trump considers mounting a military strike on Iran. Ms. Gabbard, a critic of overseas entanglements, has privately raised concerns of a wider war. And on Friday Mr. Trump said “she’s wrong” when he was asked about her testimony in March that Iran had not decided to build a nuclear weapon.\n\nAfter the video was posted, the president also told Ms. Gabbard that he was disappointed in her, and wished she had used better judgment, according to one of the two people briefed on the conversation. He told Ms. Gabbard that he believed she was using her time working for him to set herself up for higher office. Mr. Trump told Ms. Gabbard that if she wanted to run for president, she should not be in the administration, one of the people briefed on the meeting said.\n\nWhile Ms. Gabbard is a former Democrat, her credentials as a critic of America’s long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and as a skeptic of foreign military interventions appeal to Mr. Trump’s base, and her views dovetail with those of some of his other advisers. Her supporters are openly advocating that the president keep her.\n\n“The president needs someone who will give him the right intelligence information, whether he likes it or not,” said Daniel L. Davis, an analyst at the think tank Defense Priorities, which advocates a restrained foreign policy. “If you put someone else in there, they might only tell him what he wants to hear.”\n\nMr. Davis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, was Ms. Gabbard’s choice for a top intelligence role before criticism from Republicans over his skepticism of Israel’s war in Gaza forced her to rescind the appointment.\n\nThere is no question, officials said, that Ms. Gabbard’s standing has been weakened and that she is embattled. But few in the administration want to see her depart. Some say she has people who like her, while others worry about who might replace her. Two officials said that Mr. Trump’s anger over the video had faded and that they were back on better terms.\n\nMs. Gabbard continues to brief the president regularly and speaks often to John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, who held Ms. Gabbard’s job in the first Trump administration, according to multiple officials.\n\nIn a statement, the White House press office dismissed any notion she has been sidelined. Steven Cheung, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump had “full confidence” in his national security team. “D.N.I. Gabbard is an important member of the president’s team and her work continues to serve him and this country well,” Mr. Cheung said.\n\nMs. Gabbard was an aggressive supporter of Mr. Trump on the 2024 campaign trail. He and his top advisers valued her input, especially when Mr. Trump was preparing to debate Vice President Kamala Harris — whom Ms. Gabbard had memorably attacked in a Democratic primary debate in 2019.\n\nAfter the election, Mr. Trump quickly decided to nominate her for director of national intelligence. But from the beginning he made clear to associates that he harbored some doubts. Mr. Trump, according to associates, saw her as overly interested in her own success.\n\nMr. Trump drew a contrast between Ms. Gabbard and the other former Democrat he named to his cabinet, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n“Bobby’s a star,” Mr. Trump told one associate. “Tulsi? Tulsi wants to be a star.” Mr. Trump’s implication was that unlike Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Gabbard did not have what it took to succeed in politics.\n\nAnd soon after her swearing-in, he began to complain about her effectiveness.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump — long mistrustful of the intelligence community — questioned whether there needed to be an Office of the Director of National Intelligence at all.\n\nA senior intelligence official said Ms. Gabbard had overseen a 25 percent cut in the size of her office. And Ms. Gabbard has repeatedly told people in the White House that she is willing to be the last director of national intelligence, according to an official. The office, Ms. Gabbard said, could be reabsorbed into the C.I.A., or become something akin to the National Security Council, a bare-bones oversight group.\n\nAt least for a time, the kind of foreign policy restraint Ms. Gabbard favors appeared to gain traction this spring.\n\nIn White House discussions about Israel and Iran, Ms. Gabbard raised the range of possible consequences of an Israeli strike against Iran, saying it could trigger a wider conflict that brought in the United States. Vice President JD Vance, at times also a skeptic of military intervention, made similar arguments and was among those who supported Mr. Trump’s impulse to initially try to negotiate a deal with Iran.\n\nAs the C.I.A. delivered intelligence reports that Israel intended to strike Iran regardless, Mr. Trump and senior aides became more publicly supportive of the Israeli campaign.\n\nMs. Gabbard did not attend a key meeting at Camp David, where Mr. Ratcliffe presented assessments about Iran’s nuclear program. Ms. Gabbard, according to officials, was on Army Reserve duty. Other people with knowledge of the matter have said she was not invited. (Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Ms. Gabbard had met daily with Mr. Trump and his team.)\n\nThen on Tuesday, Mr. Trump contradicted Ms. Gabbard in public. After the Israeli strikes began, a journalist on Air Force One asked Mr. Trump about Ms. Gabbard’s testimony in March that Iran had not decided to make a nuclear bomb.\n\n“I don’t care what she said,” Mr. Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.”\n\nHe made similar comments on Friday.\n\nAn official from Ms. Gabbard’s office said her position was not at odds with Mr. Trump’s. In her testimony, Ms. Gabbard reported the consensus opinion of the intelligence community: that Iran’s supreme leader had not authorized the country to build a nuclear weapon. But Ms. Gabbard had also noted Iran’s large stocks of enriched uranium and a shift in tone that was “likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran’s decision-making apparatus.”\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s Air Force One remark came off as a rebuke.\n\nTo a certain extent, some officials said, courting Mr. Trump’s displeasure is a hazard of any intelligence job in his administration.\n\nMr. Trump believes the intelligence community undermined him in his first term, and his long-held skepticism that it is part of a disloyal deep state continues. Ms. Gabbard, when briefing Mr. Trump, presents a range of options and assessments. But it is difficult to talk about the findings of spy agencies and not raise Mr. Trump’s ire, the official said.\n\nMs. Gabbard’s most important job as director of national intelligence is overseeing, and delivering, the president’s daily intelligence brief. But the brief is actually produced a few miles from her office at the C.I.A., and many of those working on the document are detailed from the agency. Ms. Gabbard announced internally last month that she would physically move the production of the brief to her headquarters, known as Liberty Crossing.\n\nWithin the administration, several senior officials saw it as a way to try to enhance her own relevance at a time when Mr. Trump was questioning the relevance of the office.

Mr. Vance, seen as the most senior voice for a less hawkish, more restrained foreign policy, issued a long social media post defending the administration’s support of Israel’s attack on Iran.

He said that her discussion of nuclear annihilation would scare people and that officials should not talk about it.\n\nMr. Trump’s displeasure with the video laid bare months of his skepticism of Ms. Gabbard and frustrations with her. The president and some administration officials viewed her overseas travel, as the video exemplified, as being as much about self-promotion of her political career as it was about the business of government, multiple officials said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal dynamics of the administration.\n\nBut the tensions surrounding Ms. Gabbard are now in the open, as Mr. Trump considers mounting a military strike on Iran. Ms. Gabbard, a critic of overseas entanglements, has privately raised concerns of a wider war. And on Friday Mr. Trump said “she’s wrong” when he was asked about her testimony in March that Iran had not decided to build a nuclear weapon.\n\nAfter the video was posted, the president also told Ms. Gabbard that he was disappointed in her, and wished she had used better judgment, according to one of the two people briefed on the conversation. He told Ms. Gabbard that he believed she was using her time working for him to set herself up for higher office. Mr. Trump told Ms. Gabbard that if she wanted to run for president, she should not be in the administration, one of the people briefed on the meeting said.\n\nWhile Ms. Gabbard is a former Democrat, her credentials as a critic of America’s long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and as a skeptic of foreign military interventions appeal to Mr. Trump’s base, and her views dovetail with those of some of his other advisers. Her supporters are openly advocating that the president keep her.\n\n“The president needs someone who will give him the right intelligence information, whether he likes it or not,” said Daniel L. Davis, an analyst at the think tank Defense Priorities, which advocates a restrained foreign policy. “If you put someone else in there, they might only tell him what he wants to hear.”\n\nMr. Davis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, was Ms. Gabbard’s choice for a top intelligence role before criticism from Republicans over his skepticism of Israel’s war in Gaza forced her to rescind the appointment.\n\nThere is no question, officials said, that Ms. Gabbard’s standing has been weakened and that she is embattled. But few in the administration want to see her depart. Some say she has people who like her, while others worry about who might replace her. Two officials said that Mr. Trump’s anger over the video had faded and that they were back on better terms.\n\nMs. Gabbard continues to brief the president regularly and speaks often to John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, who held Ms. Gabbard’s job in the first Trump administration, according to multiple officials.\n\nIn a statement, the White House press office dismissed any notion she has been sidelined. Steven Cheung, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump had “full confidence” in his national security team. “D.N.I. Gabbard is an important member of the president’s team and her work continues to serve him and this country well,” Mr. Cheung said.\n\nMs. Gabbard was an aggressive supporter of Mr. Trump on the 2024 campaign trail. He and his top advisers valued her input, especially when Mr. Trump was preparing to debate Vice President Kamala Harris — whom Ms. Gabbard had memorably attacked in a Democratic primary debate in 2019.\n\nAfter the election, Mr. Trump quickly decided to nominate her for director of national intelligence. But from the beginning he made clear to associates that he harbored some doubts. Mr. Trump, according to associates, saw her as overly interested in her own success.\n\nMr. Trump drew a contrast between Ms. Gabbard and the other former Democrat he named to his cabinet, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n“Bobby’s a star,” Mr. Trump told one associate. “Tulsi?

John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, who lived a few miles away. He surrendered Sunday night after what authorities have called the largest search in Minnesota history.\n\nIn addition to the discovery of Boelter's hit list targeting several liberal politicians and celebrities, he also address a letter to the FBI that was described as 'rambling' and 'conspiratorial.'\n\nBoelter's letter was found in a Buick he left near his home and allegedly contains a confession to the Hortman murders and the attempted killing of the Hoffmans. \n\nThe one and a half page letter is incoherent and difficult to read, two people who were familiar with told the Minnesota Star-Tribune. \n\nBoelter allegedly claims that the military had secretly trained him to kill and Walz asked him to kill Klobuchar, among several others, so that he could replace her in the Senate. \n\nKlobuchar's current term in the Senate runs until 2030 and Walz has never stated any intention to run for anything since his failed bid for the vice presidency on Kamala Harris' losing ticket. \n\nThe junior senator from Minnesota, fellow Democrat Tina Smith, was also named in the letter. \n\nA spokesperson for the Hennepin County Attorney Mary Moriarty would only say that 'We have seen no evidence that the allegations regarding Governor Walz are based in fact.' \n\n'Governor Walz is grateful to law enforcement who apprehended the shooter, and he's grateful to the prosecutors who will ensure justice is swiftly served,' spokesperson Teddy Tschann said.\n\nTschann would only say of the later that 'this tragedy continues to be deeply disturbing for all Minnesotans.'\n\nKlobuchar, who herself ran for president in 2020, said in a statement: 'Boelter is a very dangerous man and I am deeply grateful that law enforcement got him behind bars before he killed other people.'\n\nLater Friday, it was revealed that Boelter is a doomsday prepper. \n\nBoelter could face something that is a rarity for Minnesota but could become more common under the Trump administration: the death penalty.\n\nMinnesota abolished capital punishment in 1911, and the state's last execution was a botched hanging in 1906. But federal prosecutors announced charges against Vance Boelter on Monday that can carry the death penalty. \n\nTwo of the six federal counts can carry the death penalty, something federal prosecutors have not sought in a Minnesota-based case since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976.\n\n'Will we seek the death penalty? It´s too early to tell. That is one of the options,' Acting U.S. Attorney Joseph Thompson said Monday at a news conference where he revealed new details of what he described as a meticulously planned attack. \n\nThey included allegations that Boelter also stopped at the homes of two other lawmakers that night and had dozens of other Democrats as potential targets, including officials in other states.\n\nBoelter´s federal defenders have declined to comment on the case, and he has not entered a plea.\n\nThe federal intervention in Boelter's case appeared to irritate Moriarty, the county's former chief public defender, who was elected on a police reform and racial justice platform in 2022 after the police killing of George Floyd .\n\nAt a news conference Monday to announce the state charges, Moriarty gave only vague answers in response to questions about the interplay between the federal and state investigations. \n\nBut she acknowledged 'there's a tension' and said federal officials 'can speak for themselves.'\n\nMoriarty said she intends to press forward in state court regardless and to seek an indictment for first-degree murder for the killings of the Hortmans, which would carry a mandatory sentence of life without parole.\n\nThompson told reporters that the federal case 'does not nullify the state charges. They remain in place. ... My expectation based on prior cases is the federal case, the federal charges, will be litigated first, but the state charges won´t necessarily go anywhere.'\n\nOn Wednesday, Moriarty said in an interview with The Associated Press that she told federal prosecutors that she wants her office to try Boelter first. \n\nBut she said she came away with the impression that the U.S. Attorney´s Office intends to exercise its legal authority to go first.\n\nMoriarty said she wants the first chance 'because this horrific crime happened in our community' and the lawmakers represented parts of Hennepin County. \n\nAnd she pointed out that her office tries murder cases all the time, and that it is the largest prosecutors' office in the state.\n\n'We have all the resources and experience to handle these cases because that´s what we do,' she said. 'We feel that we owe it to the community to prosecute this case, and we would like to go first.'\n\nMoriarty opposes the death penalty and hopes that the federal prosecutors decide not to seek it against Boelter, noting that she hopes to try him for first-degree murder, which would mean life without parole if he is convicted.\n\n'I certainly hope they respect the fact that Minnesota hasn´t had a death penalty for decades, and that´s because of our values here,' Moriarty said.\n\nAfter his federal court appearance, Boelter was taken to the Sherburne County Jail in suburban Elk River, where federal prisoners are often held. \n\nHis next federal court appearance is June 27. He does not have any further appearances scheduled in state court.\n\nMeanwhile, Boelter's wife has remained in hiding - as the accused assassin's defiant family were tight-lipped concerning her whereabouts, telling a DailyMail.com reporter to 'piss off.'\n\nShaken mom-of-five Jenny, 51, rang pals only to say she was in a 'safe' location but wouldn't reveal where she was.\n\nShe fled the family's bucolic farmhouse home in Green Isle, Minnesota, last Saturday morning after Boelter hinted that he had done something monstrous in a 6.18am text.\n\n'Dad went to war last night,' wrote of her 57-year-old husband.\n\n'There's gonna be some people coming to the house armed and trigger happy and I don't want you guys around.'\n\nAs news broke that Boelter had allegedly gunned down two lawmakers and their spouses in Minneapolis, Jenny was pulled over driving through Onamia, 90 miles north.\n\nShe had their youngest children in the car along with their passports, $10,000 in cash and two handguns, according to federal court filings.\n\nJenny, president of the couple's private security firm, consented to a voluntary search of her electronic devices but wasn't arrested in the 10am traffic stop. \n\nThere's nothing in her husband's charging documents to suggest she had advance knowledge of his alleged plot to slaughter dozens of Democrat lawmakers and pro-abortion activists.\n\nJenny has not commented publicly since Boelter was captured Sunday evening and charged with multiple counts of murder and stalking.\n\nHer brother Jason Doskocil, 54, had a blunt message for DailyMail.com when we asked about her whereabouts.\n\n'I'm sorry, we are not going to talk to nobody - so piss off,' he replied.\n\nBoelter was captured Sunday evening following the biggest ever manhunt in the state of Minnesota.\n\nHe had first dressed as a cop and donned a terrifying latex mask to shoot State Senator John Hoffman and his wife Yvette shortly before 2am Saturday.\n\nThe pair were left in critical condition but are expected to survive the shooting on the doorstep of their Champlin, Minnesota home.\n\nBoelter then headed to a second lawmaker's residence in Brooklyn Park, pumping multiple bullets into former State House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, killing both.\n\nThe lunatic had drawn up a chilling assassination list of 45 targets including Democrat lawmakers, abortion providers and pro-choice activists, it's alleged.\n\nBut his murder spree was halted in its tracks when police intercepted him leaving the Hortman's' home and engaged him in a firefight.\n\nThe gunman fled on foot, leaving behind three AK-47 assault rifles and a 9mm handgun, triggering a massive hunt spanning multiple states and law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe search narrowed Sunday night to woodland and swampy farmland one mile away from the Boelter residence.\n\nOfficers first found an abandoned Buick that he had bought off a stranger he met in the street in a madcap scheme to escape.\n\nWhen the fugitive was spotted on a trail cam cops set up a square-mile perimeter deploying drones, dogs and helicopters to flush him out. \n\nNeighbor Wendy Thomas eventually spotted Boelter ducking down beside a culvert and flagged SWAT teams who took the alleged shooter alive.","summary":"In addition to the discovery of Boelter's hit list including several liberal politicians and celebrities, he also address a letter to the FBI that was described as 'rambling' and 'conspiratorial.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14834009/Minnesota-shooting-Vance-Boelter-Tim-Walz-FBI.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/21/05/99589073-0-image-m-14_1750480596741.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 05:15:53","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

Many around the world may be wondering, what took so long?\n\nIn Los Angeles, protesters took to the streets peacefully, until they were confronted by a militarised police force and then the actual military. New York City has erupted in protest after witnessing New York City public school children being disappeared into unmarked vans by masked men.\n\nIn El Paso, Texas, my hometown on the US-Mexico border, people have also come out to denounce the silent procession of women and children being escorted into white vans by federal agents, in denial of their most basic legal rights.\n\nWhat began as scattered demonstrations against increasingly hostile roundups of suspected undocumented immigrants by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has grown into a nationwide movement. This comes as the Trump administration has set a quota for ICE to detain 3,000 people per day. And yet, something feels off. Rehearsed. Expected. If you listen closely, you can almost hear the trap closing.\n\nThe protests of recent weeks have not surprised the people in power. They were anticipated and provoked.\n\nTrump, the Republican Party, the state and federal agencies now under their sway, and an eager right-wing media ecosystem are not flinching, they are filming. They are gathering content for a campaign narrative, counting on being able to drum up enough outrage and fear to justify the next wave of crackdowns and the suppression of rights.\n\nThe imagery of students being arrested with zip ties, flags burning, police cars pelted with rocks, tents being cleared from university lawns will be used not just to animate Trump’s base, but to validate his authority.\n\nThis is the oldest authoritarian move in the book: provoke the people, film their resistance, criminalise their passion, and promise to restore “order”. This playbook wasn’t invented by Trump. It was first put into action in the US by Democratic governors and mayors—liberal leaders who deployed riot gear against protesters, cleared encampments, and treated dissent as public disorder.\n\nAnd it’s working as intended.\n\nSelective rights from both sides of the aisle\n\nIn theory, the US Constitution guarantees all people, regardless of race or belief, the right to free speech and peaceful protest. But in practice, those rights are applied unevenly.\n\nTrump maintains that anyone who disrespects the American flag or ICE should face jail time. But that threat is not extended to demonstrators waving Israeli or Ukrainian flags—or to politicians on both sides of the aisle who proudly display those flags in their offices. That’s not patriotism; it’s a racialised hierarchy of who is allowed to dissent, and who must be punished for trying.\n\nWhat makes the situation all the more dangerous is that it predates Trump. The foundations for this moment have been laid by politicians on both sides of the American political spectrum who have painted some protests as legitimate democratic expression and others as national threats.\n\nThe most recent and glaring example of this is the way that protests in support of Palestine have been deemed dangerous, hostile, and anti-semitic by both Democrat and Republican politicians who have supported the use of force by police to bring them to heel, even in some of the most prestigious university campuses. It’s a short journey from there to Trump now calling in the National Guard and the Marines to suppress anti-ICE protests.\n\nAmid Trump’s authoritarian theatrics, what is not being discussed is the fact that his election rival, Kamala Harris, promised to be tougher on the border than him. Or that Barack Obama deported more than three million people during his two terms in office. Basically, both of America’s two dominant political parties set the wheels in motion for this long ago.\n\nA global colonialism\n\nIt’s no wonder, then, that many Americans are feeling defeated. Worn down. Disillusioned. How do we begin to pull ourselves out of this moment? Perhaps part of the answer is by beginning to shift our perspective from a narrow national frame to a global one.\n\nThis is not just about Trump, although he is central. Voter suppression, court-packing, culture war hysteria, militarised policing are part of a global pattern. From Hungary to India to Israel to the US, democratically elected leaders are increasingly governing like kings.\n\nIn Pakistan, millions of Afghans who have been in the country for decades are being driven out and back into a Taliban-controlled homeland many have never seen. In Iran, critics of the Islamic Republic are making racist claims that Shi’a Afghans are being brought in to change the voting demographics of the country. In Türkiye, similar claims are being made about Afghans and Syrians being used to bolster support for President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.\n\nIn Latin America, the US has found allies like President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador, who has ramped up the incarceration and deportation of migrants with no criminal records, often accusing them, without evidence, of ties to organised crime, particularly the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.\n\nFor years, EU countries have also been militarising their borders, stripping away asylum rights, and sending money to support security forces in neighbouring countries, despite well-documented cases of abuse, to clamp down on migration. In many ways, the EU is also gearing up to try to carry out its own campaign of mass deportations.\n\nNone of this is all that dissimilar to the policies of Trump and his ilk in the US. In all of these cases, colonial structures (borders, citizenship regimes, racial hierarchies) continue to define who deserves protection and who can be erased.\n\nDon’t let peace simply be order with fear\n\nAround the world, people have lived through decades of authoritarian rule, many supported or propped up into power by former US administrations. Others are just beginning to feel that shift now. Either way, we are not alone. We have communities across borders, languages, and continents who have wisdom, resistance strategies, and solidarity to offer. We must reach out, learn, and build together.\n\nWhat’s happening in our cities, in our courts, and in our schools is not isolated, it’s global. But our response must begin with truth. With care. With resistance that is grounded in clarity, not chaos. Grounded in relationships with our neighbours, the people we see every day and can impact beyond the headlines and social media feeds.\n\nI’m reminded of the words of Kwame Ture, formerly Stokely Carmichael, a global Black liberation leader and one of the most influential voices of the US civil rights and Pan-African movements. Ture drew a clear distinction: “Peace is the white man’s word,” he said. “Liberation is our word.”\n\nThat line cuts to the heart of our moment. “Peace”, as it’s being invoked now, is not the absence of violence, it’s the presence of order maintained through fear. It’s the quiet that follows the vanishing of your neighbour. It’s a silence that coexists comfortably with cages, with courtrooms that serve as traps, with a public too afraid or too exhausted to speak.\n\nWhat the protesters are demanding is not peace. It’s liberation. But to achieve that, we have to learn from those who have trod this path before us, both inside and outside of the US.\n\nThe trap that is being laid is real. The repression is real.

What do you think?” Vance wrote Thursday, quickly sparking thousands of replies dripping with snark. \n\nSince President Trump has taken office, his administration has abandoned former President Biden’s defense of gender-affirming care. Trump’s Justice Department dropped the legal challenge to Tennessee’s ban, and in May, his Department of Health and Human Services declared there is a “lack of robust evidence” for the treatments. \n\nIn a New York Times opinion piece following the Supreme Court ruling, the mother of the transgender teen who challenged Tennessee’s law mourned the decision to block care for her daughter. \n\n“I am deeply afraid for what this decision will unleash politically and socially,” Samantha Williams wrote. “Now that the Supreme Court has denied the rights of young people like my daughter and families like ours, what’s next?” \n\nMajor American medical groups have said gender-affirming care for transgender youth and adults is medically necessary.\n\nBut Thomas in his opinion declared that legally irrelevant, saying trusting those groups would otherwise allow “elite sentiment” to “distort and stifle democratic debate.” \n\n“There are particularly good reasons to question the expert class here, as recent revelations suggest that leading voices in this area have relied on questionable evidence, and have allowed ideology to influence their medical guidance,” Thomas wrote. \n\nThe Supreme Court’s decision instead looks to Europe, citing health authorities in Finland, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The justices particularly emphasized the Cass Review, an influential 2024 report from England questioning the treatments. \n\n“Health authorities in a number of European countries have raised significant concerns regarding the potential harms associated with using puberty blockers and hormones to treat transgender minors,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. \n\nThe increased prominence of conservatives’ attacks come as public trust in health officials and agencies continues to plummet more broadly, a decline that began during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nTrust in state and local public health officials dropped by 10 percentage points to 54 percent, while the share of those who say they trust the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also slipped 5 percentage points, according to January polling from health nonprofit KFF. \n\n“Justice Thomas soundly put to rest the persistent sham that we should quiet down and ‘trust the science’ when it comes to life-altering experimentation on minors,” Katherine Green Robertson, chief counsel of Alabama’s attorney general’s office, said in a statement following the decision. \n\nThe state filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case, urging the justices not to decide it on “euphemisms about ‘affirming care’ and unsupported appeals to ‘expert’ organizations.” \n\n“Alabama is proud to have armed the Court with a full rundown of the medical community’s shameless political collusion on this matter, which should permanently discredit every organization involved,” she said. \n\nThe justices’ reliance on outside research has come into question before. \n\nJustice Ketanji Brown Jackson caught heat after a study she cited in her 2023 dissent in Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard, which sharply limited the use of race as a factor in college admissions, was disputed. \n\nIn an impassioned dissent expounding on the benefits of diversity in education, Jackson pointed to a friend-of-the-court brief by the Association of American Medical Colleges, which referenced the 2020 study.\n\n“It saves lives,” she wrote, pointing to the research that showed having a Black physician more than doubles the likelihood a high-risk Black baby will live. \n\nIn the following months, critics began to debunk the claim, suggesting at first that the justice misrepresented the statistic, and later, that the research itself was inaccurate. \n\n“Even Supreme Court justices are known to be gullible,” lawyer Ted Frank wrote in a Wall Street Journal op-ed at the time. \n\nIt’s not just studies that support left-leaning views that have come under scrutiny, either. \n\nA month before the Supreme Court weighed whether to allow access to mifepristone, one of the two common drugs used in medication abortion, a medical journal retracted two studies claiming to show the harms of the pill. \n\nThe studies, published in the Sage journal Health Services Research and Managerial Epidemiology and backed by an anti-abortion group, were retracted after a reader raised concerns about the study’s accuracy and a review found the conclusions “invalidated in whole or in part.” \n\nU.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk had pointed to the studies in his decision siding with the conservative medical group Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine, which invalidated the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval of mifepristone because it overlooked safety concerns. \n\nThe justices ultimately ruled unanimously last year that the anti-abortion doctors did not have standing to challenge access to mifepristone, declining to address the underlying regulatory or safety issues. \n\nIn the gender-affirming care case, the Supreme Court’s decision aligned with the conservative voices that have called on the court to give credence to political forces over educational ones and the shift did not go unnoticed. \n\n“The vibe shift is real,” Roger Severino, a vice president at the Heritage Foundation who ran Health and Human Services’s civil rights office during Trump’s first term, told supporters after the decision. \n\n“Not only was it political in the last election, President Trump’s closing argument is that ‘she is for they/them, and he is for you,’” he continued, referring to a campaign slogan Trump used against former Vice President Kamala Harris. “And here, the court not that they’re political animals at least they’re consistent with where the American people are.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSupreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’s shunning of “experts” defending gender-affirming care is&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Justice Thomas Cheers Conservatives by Rejecting Gender-Affirming Care Specialists first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/justice-thomas-cheers-conservatives-by-rejecting-gender-affirming-care-specialists/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Justice-Thomas-delights-conservatives-in-shunning-gender-affirming.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 03:11:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.228},{"id":333612134,"title":"As Shares Skyrocket, Will Creator Deals Drive Netflix’s Next Growth Run?","text":"(Photo by Phil Barker/Future Publishing via Getty Images)\nFuture Publishing via Getty Images\n\nNetflix has been on an epic stock market run the past year, share prices up 81% to nestle comfortably above $1,200 apiece as it reaps the rewards of definitively winning the Streaming Wars of the past several years, with analysts setting target prices as high as $1,600.\n\nGive credit to management’s willingness to pivot, after a disastrous Q1 earnings call three years ago, into ad-supported tiers, a password crackdown, videogame and live events/venues initiatives, and investments in local productions in 50 centers around the world. It’s paid off massively for the company and its investors. This week saw Pivotal Research set a Street-high target price of $1,600 for Netflix shares.\n\nNetflix shares have skyrocketed the past 12 months, to north of $1,200 a piece\nGraphic created by David Bloom\n\nBut where does the streaming giant go from here if it wants to keep driving growth? The ad tier is launched, and growing slowly, but already bringing in higher average revenue per user than Netflix’s traditional ad-free offerings.\n\nThe password crackdown’s boost to subscriber growth is likely largely exhausted, though we won’t know going forward, because the company stopped r0utinely reporting subscriber adds before the last earnings call. In that call, the company said it added a whopping 13 million subscribers to puff the global total to 301 million, far larger than any competitor.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nSo where to go to grow? Analysts have some thoughts, mostly about the vast collection of wildly diverse talent pumping out episodes on YouTube and other social media, receiving a share of ad revenue and otherwise monetizing their productions with merchandise, sponsorships, live events and other strategies.\n\nThat approach has paid off massively for Alphabet-owned YouTube. Nielsen’s The Gauge estimates more than 12% of total watch time is devoted to YouTube programming. Roku released stats that were even higher, as much as 18% of view time.\n\nWells Fargo analysts released a note earlier in the week setting a $1,500 target price for Netflix, but suggesting it find ways to be a bit more like YouTube.\n\nWells Fargo Sr. Equity Analyst Steven Cahall said Friday in a CNBC interview that YouTube content, which costs YouTube nothing on the front end, is increasingly grabbing view time with young and even middle-aged consumers. And that’s exactly the kind of programming Netflix should be adding to its portfolio.\n\n“Some of this very, very high value, professional short-form seems like a natural in-between where it still has a big impact on consumers but it’s not quite the really short, mobile-native, user-generated content,” Cahall said.\n\nTo grab some of that view time back, Netflix should take a page out of its own playbook from about a decade ago, when it cut nine-figure exclusive deals with prominent showrunners in traditional television such as Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy, Cahall said.\n\nThe splashy deals put the industry on notice about Netflix’s ambitions to create high-quality premium content that could contend with anything on broadcast or cable.\n\n“The argument here is they can do the same thing,\" Cahall said. “They can go find these really large-scale creators who put a lot of content on YouTube, get a lot of views, and make a lot of money, and they can say, 'Hey, come to Netflix, you have the same size audience. We’ll pay you money, and you don’t have to take a risk on advertising.”\n\nSuch deals will “take money,” though nothing like those Rhimes and Murphy deals of a decade ago. More importantly, Cahall said, “it’s not the same risk profile.” The creators bring their own audience, and deep knowledge about how to connect with and nurture that audience, removing most of the risk of partnering with them.\n\nCertainly, there are plenty of big, long-time online creators who are producing good-quality content at remarkable velocity. In recent months, I’ve interviewed or moderated panels with leaders from such long-time venues as Smosh, Dhar Mann Studios, Buzzfeed Studios, and Pocket.Watch.\n\nDhar Mann CEO Sean Atkins, a long-time cable TV veteran, said he gives a few tours a week of the company’s extensive production studios in Burbank, Calif., just a couple of miles from the studio lots of Warner Bros., Disney and NBCUniversal. There’s an “oh, sh--” moment on the tour for most of the folks, Atkins said, when they see Dhar Mann’s operations are sprawling enough to need the same golf carts to get around the grounds as on the traditional studios.\n\nAt last week’s StreamTV Show conference in Denver, I interviewed Trey Kennedy, an Oklahoma-based comedian who started telling six-second jokes on the long-gone social-video site Vine. Kennedy has long since migrated to TikTok and YouTube for his humor, building an audience big enough that he cut a deal with Hulu for a one-hour comedy special released in January. He has a national comedy tour set for the fall.\n\nAlso at The StreamTV Show, I interviewed Laura Martin, managing director and sr. internet & media analyst for Needham & Co. To her mind, the 100-plus exhibitors and dozens of niche networks on display at the conference are largely ignored by Wall Street because they’re not able to compete at a big enough scale with the two companies that matter most, Amazon and YouTube.\n\nAmazon’s links between advertising and directly selling those advertised products to its couple of a hundred million or so Prime Video subscribers make it one powerful path for the future of video. And YouTube has married oceans of user-generated content with television’s highest-value programming, the NFL, which is available through YouTube TV.\n\n“On the content side, they’re sort of blurring the lines, we sort of think that’s where the world is going writ large,” Martin said. Wall Street looks at the smaller players and wonders, “Why aren’t you talking about short-form, omni-device and influencers, plus -premium content. There’s a real disconnect.\"\n\nMartin said both Paramount Global and Warner Bros. Discovery are stuck in a “distracted” place. Paramount is trying to negotiated a lawsuit settlement directly with President Donald Trump over alleged “election interference” for editing a Kamala Harris interview last fall on 60 Minutes. The delays in settling that suit are in danger of putting controlling shareholder Shari Redstone’s National Amusements in default before it can complete an $8 billion sale to a group led by David Ellison and Skydance Entertainment.\n\nWBD, meanwhile, announced last week that it would go ahead with a widely expected split of the company, putting its legacy cable channels such as CNN, TNT, TBS, and Discovery in one unit, along with most of WBD’s $34 billion in debt and a share of the spun-off Studios & Streaming unit. That latter group would include the Max (soon to be renamed HBO Max) streaming service and WBD’s production studios for film, TV and games.\n\nShepherding that split to reality will leave WBD leadership distracted for a year, Martin estimated, then will have to wait another year before doing any deals, because of tax-minimization strategies.\n\n“I think it’s the wrong strategic move,” Martin said. “We’re not going to be talk about either of those companies for the next two or three years.\"\n\nThat leaves a “competitive set” of serious streaming players of just four: Netflix, Amazon, Alphabet/YouTube, and Disney.\n\n“The question will be if Disney is too small to compete,” Martin said. “Its (market valuation) is $200 billion, Netflix is $500 billion and the rest are more than $2 trillion.”\n\nFor Netflix, grabbing more content from YouTube’s stable might just be a way to keep driving growth, and perhaps even slightly slowing the YouTube juggernaut, mostly by being a bit more like what YouTube has become.\n\nEditorial StandardsReprints & Permissions","summary":"Netflix shares have taken off the past year, but what will drive the next era of growth?

Gavin Newsom (D) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass for having “actively encouraged illegal migration,” and accused them of having “strained” law enforcement and public services in the community.\n\nWhen asked about his reaction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruling that President Donald Trump was allowed to federalize the California National Guard, Vance explained that the Ninth Circuit basically said that federalizing of the National Guard “was a completely legitimate and proper use of federal law enforcement.”\n\n“The President has a very simple proposal, to everybody and every city, every community, every town — whether big or small, if you enforce your own laws, and if you protect federal law enforcement, we’re not going to send in the National Guard because it’s unnecessary,” Vance explained. “But, if you let violent rioters burn great American cities to the ground, then of course we’re going to send federal law enforcement in to protect the people the president was elected to protect.”\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported, on Thursday, in a 38-page opinion, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that Trump was allowed to federalize the California National Guard:\n\nIn a 38-page opinion, the judges — two appointees of President Trump, and one of President Joe Biden — held that the president is likely to prevail on the merits of the case, and extended a stay of the district court’s temporary restraining order (TRO) against the administration.\nWhile the judges concluded that Trump’s power over the National Guard was not unreviewable by the courts, they also conclude, based on precedent, that they have to defer to his judgement. They also noted that the main objection raised by Newsom — namely, that Trump had not consulted with the governor’s office — was invalid, because Trump fulfilled his duty simply by informing the governor. Even if Newsom were right, they ruled, that would not invalidate Trump’s authority.\n\nEarlier this month, as riots broke out in Los Angeles, Trump federalized 2,000 California National Guardsmen to quell the violence. In response to Trump deploying the National Guard, Democrats such as former Vice President Kamala Harris and Newsom described the move as a “dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.”\n\nChief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell later revealed that an “additional 2,000 California National Guard” were being federalized.\n\nAdditionally, the Trump administration also sent hundreds of U.S. Marines to Los Angeles to support the California National Guard.","summary":"Vice President JD Vance warned Democrat governors that if they allow rioters to \"burn great American cities to the ground,\" the Trump administration would \"send federal law enforcement in to protect the people.\"\n\n\nThe post JD Vance Warns Democrat Governors of Consequences of Letting &#8216;Rioters Burn&#8217; Cities to the Ground: &#8216;Going to Send Federal Law Enforcement&#8217; appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/06/20/jd-vance-warns-democrat-governors-of-consequences-of-letting-rioters-burn-cities-to-the-ground-going-to-send-federal-law-enforcement/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/06/Los-Angeles-riots-Mexican-flag-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-21 01:22:41","author":"Elizabeth Weibel","authors":["Elizabeth Weibel"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.355},{"id":333614266,"title":"Clinton Campaign Manager: Democrats 'Leaderless' After 2024 Election 'Massacre'","text":"Veteran Democrat strategist Patti Solis Doyle slammed her party as “leaderless” and “agendaless” with former President Joe Biden “off the radar completely,” blasting the White House for trying to cover up his obvious mental decline.\n\nSolis Doyle, who served as Hillary Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign manager, told journalist Mark Halperin how happy she is to have taken a step away from the “middle of politics” due to “what’s going on in the party” during a recent podcast interview:\n\n“I have never been happier not to be actually in it — in the middle of politics — than I am right now, because it sounds really depressing, what’s going on at the party,” she said, emphasizing how Democrats are “getting attacked from all sides” for losing the White House back to President Donald Trump. \n\nShe continued, “The other problem that they have is that there’s no real leader.

Cuban didn’t argue that point. “Obviously it would have been different,” he said. “My personality is completely different than Tim’s. My experiences, my background are completely different.”\nHe acknowledged that while his style may have stood out in a race that needed disruption, it likely would have clashed with the structure and diplomacy the role demands. “I think I’ve cut through the sh–t more directly,” he added. “I’m not a politician. And so, it would have been different, but it would have been awful.”\nMiller pushed back, suggesting Cuban’s impact could’ve been bigger than he realized. At one point, he even said Cuban might have been “better than the present situation”—a reference to the current Trump-Vance administration that swept the 2024 election.\nCould Mark Cuban have changed the outcome? That’s a question for political theorists. But it’s clear he was closer to the White House than most ever imagined.","summary":"Before the 2024 presidential election solidified into a Kamala Harris versus Donald Trump showdown, Mark Cuban considered stepping into the political arena himself, per TheSpun.

Security Council session on Iran and Israel, amid pleas for peace.","text":"Speaking directly to the camera, Ms. Gabbard warned that the threat of nuclear war remained. “As we stand here today, closer to the brink of nuclear annihilation than ever before,” she said, “political elites and warmongers are carelessly fomenting fear and tension between nuclear powers.”\n\nMr. Trump berated Ms. Gabbard for the video, according to two people briefed on the conversation. He said that her discussion of nuclear annihilation would scare people and that officials should not talk about it.\n\nMr. Trump’s displeasure with the video laid bare months of his skepticism of Ms. Gabbard and frustrations with her. The president and some administration officials viewed her overseas travel, as the video exemplified, as being as much about self-promotion of her political career as it was about the business of government, multiple officials said, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal dynamics of the administration.\n\nBut the tensions surrounding Ms. Gabbard are now in the open, as Mr. Trump considers mounting a military strike on Iran. Ms. Gabbard, a critic of overseas entanglements, has privately raised concerns of a wider war. And on Friday Mr. Trump said “she’s wrong” when he was asked about her testimony in March that Iran had not decided to build a nuclear weapon.\n\nAfter the video was posted, the president also told Ms. Gabbard that he was disappointed in her, and wished she had used better judgment, according to one of the two people briefed on the conversation. He told Ms. Gabbard that he believed she was using her time working for him to set herself up for higher office. Mr. Trump told Ms. Gabbard that if she wanted to run for president, she should not be in the administration, one of the people briefed on the meeting said.\n\nWhile Ms. Gabbard is a former Democrat, her credentials as a critic of America’s long wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and as a skeptic of foreign military interventions appeal to Mr. Trump’s base, and her views dovetail with those of some of his other advisers. Her supporters are openly advocating that the president keep her.\n\n“The president needs someone who will give him the right intelligence information, whether he likes it or not,” said Daniel L. Davis, an analyst at the think tank Defense Priorities, which advocates a restrained foreign policy. “If you put someone else in there, they might only tell him what he wants to hear.”\n\nMr. Davis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel, was Ms. Gabbard’s choice for a top intelligence role before criticism from Republicans over his skepticism of Israel’s war in Gaza forced her to rescind the appointment.\n\nThere is no question, officials said, that Ms. Gabbard’s standing has been weakened and that she is embattled. But few in the administration want to see her depart. Some say she has people who like her, while others worry about who might replace her. Two officials said that Mr. Trump’s anger over the video had faded and that they were back on better terms.\n\nMs. Gabbard continues to brief the president regularly and speaks often to John Ratcliffe, the C.I.A. director, who held Ms. Gabbard’s job in the first Trump administration, according to multiple officials.\n\nIn a statement, the White House press office dismissed any notion she has been sidelined. Steven Cheung, a White House spokesman, said Mr. Trump had “full confidence” in his national security team. “D.N.I. Gabbard is an important member of the president’s team and her work continues to serve him and this country well,” Mr. Cheung said.\n\nMs. Gabbard was an aggressive supporter of Mr. Trump on the 2024 campaign trail. He and his top advisers valued her input, especially when Mr. Trump was preparing to debate Vice President Kamala Harris — whom Ms. Gabbard had memorably attacked in a Democratic primary debate in 2019.\n\nAfter the election, Mr. Trump quickly decided to nominate her for director of national intelligence. But from the beginning he made clear to associates that he harbored some doubts. Mr. Trump, according to associates, saw her as overly interested in her own success.\n\nMr. Trump drew a contrast between Ms. Gabbard and the other former Democrat he named to his cabinet, Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n“Bobby’s a star,” Mr. Trump told one associate. “Tulsi? Tulsi wants to be a star.” Mr. Trump’s implication was that unlike Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Gabbard did not have what it took to succeed in politics.\n\nAnd soon after her swearing-in, he began to complain about her effectiveness.\n\nAt the same time, Mr. Trump — long mistrustful of the intelligence community — questioned whether there needed to be an Office of the Director of National Intelligence at all.\n\nA senior intelligence official said Ms. Gabbard had overseen a 25 percent cut in the size of her office. And Ms. Gabbard has repeatedly told people in the White House that she is willing to be the last director of national intelligence, according to an official. The office, Ms. Gabbard said, could be reabsorbed into the C.I.A., or become something akin to the National Security Council, a bare-bones oversight group.\n\nAt least for a time, the kind of foreign policy restraint Ms. Gabbard favors appeared to gain traction this spring.\n\nIn White House discussions about Israel and Iran, Ms. Gabbard raised the range of possible consequences of an Israeli strike against Iran, saying it could trigger a wider conflict that brought in the United States. Vice President JD Vance, at times also a skeptic of military intervention, made similar arguments and was among those who supported Mr. Trump’s impulse to initially try to negotiate a deal with Iran.\n\nAs the C.I.A. delivered intelligence reports that Israel intended to strike Iran regardless, Mr. Trump and senior aides became more publicly supportive of the Israeli campaign.\n\nMs. Gabbard did not attend a key meeting at Camp David, where Mr. Ratcliffe presented assessments about Iran’s nuclear program. Ms. Gabbard, according to officials, was on Army Reserve duty. Other people with knowledge of the matter have said she was not invited. (Karoline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, said Ms. Gabbard had met daily with Mr. Trump and his team.)\n\nThen on Tuesday, Mr. Trump contradicted Ms. Gabbard in public. After the Israeli strikes began, a journalist on Air Force One asked Mr. Trump about Ms. Gabbard’s testimony in March that Iran had not decided to make a nuclear bomb.\n\n“I don’t care what she said,” Mr. Trump said. “I think they were very close to having it.”\n\nHe made similar comments on Friday.\n\nAn official from Ms. Gabbard’s office said her position was not at odds with Mr. Trump’s. In her testimony, Ms. Gabbard reported the consensus opinion of the intelligence community: that Iran’s supreme leader had not authorized the country to build a nuclear weapon. But Ms. Gabbard had also noted Iran’s large stocks of enriched uranium and a shift in tone that was “likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran’s decision-making apparatus.”\n\nBut Mr. Trump’s Air Force One remark came off as a rebuke.\n\nTo a certain extent, some officials said, courting Mr. Trump’s displeasure is a hazard of any intelligence job in his administration.\n\nMr. Trump believes the intelligence community undermined him in his first term, and his long-held skepticism that it is part of a disloyal deep state continues. Ms. Gabbard, when briefing Mr. Trump, presents a range of options and assessments. But it is difficult to talk about the findings of spy agencies and not raise Mr. Trump’s ire, the official said.\n\nMs. Gabbard’s most important job as director of national intelligence is overseeing, and delivering, the president’s daily intelligence brief. But the brief is actually produced a few miles from her office at the C.I.A., and many of those working on the document are detailed from the agency. Ms. Gabbard announced internally last month that she would physically move the production of the brief to her headquarters, known as Liberty Crossing.\n\nWithin the administration, several senior officials saw it as a way to try to enhance her own relevance at a time when Mr. Trump was questioning the relevance of the office. Others said it was an expensive decision that would be logistically difficult to carry out. \n\nUltimately, the White House put the move on pause, according to multiple people briefed on the matter.\n\nMs. Gabbard has influential defenders inside and outside the government. Mr. Vance, seen as the most senior voice for a less hawkish, more restrained foreign policy, issued a long social media post defending the administration’s support of Israel’s attack on Iran. He added to that a message supporting Ms. Gabbard. He also released a statement calling her a “patriot.”\n\nHer supporters insist that she remains relevant and that, over time, her skepticism of American intervention in Ukraine and caution on military action against Iran will once more prevail. The possible delay of any decision by Mr. Trump to strike Iran represents an opportunity for diplomacy and critics of American military intervention to make the case for restraint, some of Ms. Gabbard’s supporters said.\n\nOlivia C. Coleman, a spokeswoman for Ms. Gabbard’s office, dismissed the reports of dissatisfaction or tensions with the White House as “lies made up by bored, irrelevant anonymous sources with nothing better to do than sow fake division.”\n\n“The director,” Ms. Coleman said, “remains focused on her mission: providing accurate and actionable intelligence to the president, cleaning up the deep state and keeping the American people safe, secure and free.”","summary":"","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/06/21/world/iran-israel-trump/accusations-fly-at-a-heated-un-security-council-session-on-iran-and-israel-amid-pleas-for-peace","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/06/20/multimedia/20israel-iran-security-council1-jphm/20israel-iran-security-council1-jphm-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 21:39:27","author":"Aaron Boxerman,Annie Correal,Ashley Ahn,David E.

After Sunny Hostin and Sara Haines largely defended Obama’s right to stay out of the limelight after recent media discussions about his role in the Democratic Party, Navarro pushed for Obama and other past presidents to use their platforms to fight against the Trump administration. \"In normal times, former presidents would remain quiet and not criticize or attack the current president, particularly in year one when it was the honeymoon period. Well, this isn’t the honeymoon period. It’s a nightmare. It’s an American nightmare. These are not normal times,\" she said. Navarro referenced the \"No Kings\" protests across the nation last weekend where an estimated 5 million people took to the streets to protest the president and his agenda, as Trump held a military parade in Washington, D.C., to mark the Army’s 250th birthday. JOY BEHAR HOPES TO 'ACTUALLY INFLUENCE PEOPLE'S THINKING' WITH HER CRITICISM OF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION \"The American people are taking it upon themselves. They’re not waiting for a leader,\" Navarro continued. \"They’re not waiting for a great White knight or a Black knight or Latino knight to drive them out of the forest into the wilderness. They're doing it upon themselves.\" Navarro said she loved that Obama was \"happy\" and enjoying life out of the political spotlight by \"making money\" and \"making movies.\" But she insisted it was his obligation to speak out against Trump for endangering the country. \"America is in danger. Our democratic values are in danger. I think if you feel that way, each and every one of us has to do everything we absolutely can,\" she said. \"Some of us have a bigger voice. Some of us have a smaller voice.\" Navarro suggested all the living presidents could come out and make a unified public declaration rebuking the sitting president. DEMOCRATIC STRATEGISTS QUESTION INFLUENCE OF OBAMA-ERA CAMPAIGN OPERATIVES IN PARTY'S FUTURE Some progressives shared their disappointment that Obama hasn’t been more outspoken in his criticism of Trump during the president's second term. \"There are many grandmas and Rachel Maddow viewers who have been more vocal in this moment than Barack Obama has,\" co-founder of the Progressive Change Institute, Adam Green, told The Atlantic in a report published earlier this month. \"It is heartbreaking,\" Green said, \"to see him sacrificing that megaphone when nobody else quite has it.\" Obama campaigned alongside former President Joe Biden before he dropped out of the race and also stumped for former Vice President Kamala Harris when she became the nominee last year. The former president spoke out against Trump in April at an event in New York, but has largely remained out of the spotlight since Trump won.

Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., who originally proposed the bureau’s creation, applauded this move.\n\n“These proposals are a reckless, dangerous attack on consumers and would lead to more Americans being tricked and trapped by giant financial institutions and put the stability of our entire financial system at risk,” she said.\n\n“Democrats fought back, and we will keep fighting back against this ugly bill.”\n\nOne struck provision would have reduced the salaries of Federal Reserve employees, and another would have repealed Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards for vehicles.\n\nArtificial Intelligence Deregulation\n\nA provision to watch is the big, beautiful bill’s 10-year moratorium on most state regulation of artificial intelligence—which is meant to support the White House’s goal of competitiveness in AI.\n\nAfter the bill’s passage through the House, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who was not familiar with this provision in the 1,000-page mega-bill, said she would not have voted yes if she had known about it.\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson, R-La., however, told The Daily Signal he wanted it to stay in order to support the industry and compete with rivals such as China.\n\n“We have to be careful not to have 50 different states hyperregulating AI, because it has national security implications,” he said.\n\nGreene, however, told The Daily Signal she “will have no part of destroying state rights” to regulate industries.\n\nShe did, however, indicated it might not pass Senate Byrd Rule muster.\n\n“What I have heard is that it—the Byrd Rule—it might be taken out in the Senate,” she said. “I’ve heard that, but we’ll see if it happens. That’s what they’ve said, but it’s yet to be seen.”\n\nThe provision has proven just as controversial in the Senate, where Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., has filed a motion to the parliamentarian to strike it.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, a supporter of the moratorium, has used his Senate Commerce Committee chairmanship to tweak it so that it will be resistant to the Byrd Rule. \n\nHe did this by tying compliance with AI deregulation to federal broadband funding. Whether or not this deregulation—a priority for the White House—survives remains to be seen.\n\nGun Rights Protections\n\nDeregulations and tax breaks for firearms will be an important issue for the parliamentarian to examine.\n\nIn May, Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., who appeared to be a last-minute holdout, managed to secure the elimination of taxes on suppressors—an important issue to him as a gun rights advocate.\n\nNow, the parliamentarian will decide whether or not this provision can stay. \n\nIf MacDonough nixes a provision that helped win the vote of a possible holdout in the House, it could be a problem for Republicans.\n\nPlanned Parenthood\n\nMacDonough will likely also be taking a close look at Republican attempts to defund abortion provider Planned Parenthood.\n\nShe ruled against similar provisions in 2017 during Republicans’ attempt to replace the Affordable Care Act\n\nIs a Parliamentarian’s Ruling Final?\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian’s rulings are something of a setback to Republicans, but they are not necessarily final.\n\nA simple option is to amend and resubmit the provision so that the parliamentarian no longer considers it in violation.\n\nThe Senate can also motion to waive the parliamentarian’s ruling, which requires 60 votes—an unlikely outcome given Republicans’ 53-seat majority and Democrats’ unanimous opposition to the bill.\n\nThere is also the option of having the presiding officer of the Senate—in this case Vice President JD Vance—choose to ignore the parliamentarian’s rulings. This would send an earthquake through Washington and shatter precedent.\n\nFor context, back in 2021, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., urged Vice President Kamala Harris to overrule MacDonough striking a $15 minimum wage provision in the American Rescue Act, a reconciliation package.\n\n“I’m sorry—an unelected parliamentarian does not get to deprive 32 million Americans the raise they deserve,” Khanna said at the time. “This is an advisory, not a ruling. VP Harris needs to disregard and rule a $15 minimum wage in order.” Harris ultimately did not pursue this.\n\nThere is also the option of removing a parliamentarian, which Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., did with Parliamentarian Robert Dove in 2001.\n\nThese last two options are extremely unlikely, but they are in the Republicans’ toolbox if MacDonough does considerable damage to the main legislative vehicle for enacting Trump’s agenda.","summary":"The “big, beautiful bill” is going through some massive changes as the Senate Parliamentarian—the chamber&#8217;s referee and rule keeper—decides on whether or not to strike...

Federal agents arrested him after the conclusion of an asylum case hearing.\n\nThe arrest, which was captured on video circulated on social media, is the most stark demonstration yet that the Afghan allies who were instrumental to the 20-year U.S. war effort are not being spared from the Trump administration's aggressive tactics to reduce immigration.\n\nIt is also infuriating veterans who have spent the years since the withdrawal working to ensure Afghans threatened by the Taliban because of their association with the U.S. military can get to safety.\n\nRead Next: A Veteran Was Detained by Marines. It Highlights Concerns over the Military's Growing Ties to Law Enforcement.\n\n\"People are apoplectic,\" said Shawn VanDiver, a Navy veteran and founder of #AfghanEvac, which helps relocate Afghan allies. \"A lot of veterans have given up their entire lives -- myself included -- we've given up for our entire lives over the past almost four years to try to unf--- what government couldn't figure out. And we were succeeding really, really well. Until this administration came in.\"\n\nAfghans have been caught in Trump's anti-immigration policies since his first day in office in January, but some veterans, including VanDiver, had previously held out hope the effects on Afghans were unintentional given Trump's campaign rhetoric, which was heavily critical of the Afghanistan withdrawal.\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order suspending refugee admissions, stranding hundreds of Afghans who were already approved to come to the United States. Days later, a freeze in foreign aid threw the visa program specifically for Afghans who worked for the U.S. military into limbo.\n\nSince then, the Trump administration has moved to shutter the office in charge of resettling Afghans as part of a larger State Department reorganization, included Afghanistan on a list of 12 countries from which it is banning most travel, ended a legal protection for Afghans in the U.S. known as temporary protected status, and sent notices to those with another legal protection known as humanitarian parole telling them their parole was over and they needed to self-deport.\n\nThe Afghan man detained last week is one of those who received the self-deportation email, said his lawyer, Brian McGoldrick.\n\nSayed Naser, whose last name is being withheld at the request of his legal team for his protection, worked as a translator for the U.S. military from 2011 to 2013 before he and his two brothers founded a transportation and freight company that contracted with the military from 2014 to 2021, according to paperwork provided by his legal team.\n\n\"While collaborating with U.S. forces, I faced numerous threats and attacks,\" Sayed wrote in a declaration as part of his application for asylum in the U.S. \"Several times, I narrowly escaped harm, but over seven of our vehicles were burned by the Taliban. To them, anyone or any company working with foreign forces is considered an infidel and a legitimate target for killing.\"\n\nAfter the U.S. military withdrew in 2021 and the Taliban returned to power, Sayed went into hiding within Afghanistan, relocating monthly, as the Taliban hunted for him, he wrote in the declaration. He also applied for a Special Immigrant Visa, or SIV, the visa program specifically for Afghans who worked with the U.S. military during the war.\n\nIn 2023, the Taliban stormed a family wedding, he wrote.\n\n\"I received a call from my wife informing me that the Taliban had entered the wedding venue searching for me,\" he wrote. \"She told me that they shot and killed my brother, Sayed Mohammed, and took my father. She warned me to stay away from home.\"\n\nAfter that, Sayed fled to Iran, where he lived for six months before receiving a humanitarian visa for Brazil. Once in Brazil, he made the journey, by bus and by foot, north to Mexico, where he applied for asylum in the United States through a Biden administration-era program called CBP One. He stayed in Mexico until he was granted humanitarian parole to enter the U.S. while his asylum case was pending.\n\nHe legally entered the United States through the San Ysidro Port of Entry in California in July 2024, McGoldrick said.\n\nSayed was given a notice to appear in court for what essentially amounted to a status conference for his asylum claim, an order he was following when he was detained by immigration agents June 12, McGoldrick said.\n\n\"It's really shocking what's happening in the courthouse in San Diego and around the country,\" McGoldrick told reporters during a virtual briefing this week. \"You walk down the hall, and it's like you're walking down executioner's row. There's all of these armed personnel. They're eyeballing everybody as we come down, and they're just watching you, and it's just so intimidating. And the clients are terrorized. It was terrorizing to me the first couple times I saw it, and I'm a citizen.\"\n\nIn an emailed statement, Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin confirmed Sayed's arrest. The statement also denied that his immigration record included indications he worked with the U.S. government in any capacity, but the paperwork provided by his legal team includes documents confirming his contracts with the military.\n\nTrump, who ran on campaign promises to crack down on immigration and remove those without legal status under the banner \"mass deportations now,\" has unleashed a wave of military-style raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at places ranging from farms to restaurants to swap meets.\n\nICE agents, often masked and in plain clothes, have also been staking out courthouses and detaining migrants after they appear for routine hearings in their asylum cases.\n\nIt's unclear how many Afghans have been arrested at courthouses or in other immigration raids since the start of the Trump administration or how many of those detained had pending asylum or SIV applications. While the Department of Homeland Security confirmed Sayed's arrest, it did not answer a half dozen questions from Military.com about the case, including how many other Afghans have been detained since January.\n\nVanDiver, of #AfghanEvac, said it's likely other Afghans have been detained, but Sayed is the first whose arrest was captured on video.\n\nIn the video, two men wearing badges around their necks and jackets that say \"Police ICE\" approach Sayed and McGoldrick asking for documentation of who Sayed is. The agents' faces are mostly covered by neck gaiters that are pulled up to above their noses. After McGoldrick declines to give them any documentation, one of the officers says, \"That's him,\" and they detain Sayed.\n\n\"I worked with the U.S. military. Just tell it to the world,\" Sayed says to the camera as the ICE agents put handcuffs on him.\n\nAs the agents walk Sayed down the hall, McGoldrick asks to see a warrant, but the ICE agents decline to provide it immediately. McGoldrick told reporters he was eventually shown a warrant about 15 minutes later.\n\nThe video was filmed by people McGoldrick described as volunteers who have been coming to the courthouse in recent weeks to document ICE arrests.\n\nIn most cases where asylum seekers are being detained at courthouses, the arrests happen right after an immigration judge has dismissed the case at the request of the federal government. Dismissing the case allows the government to then fast-track that person's deportation.\n\nIn Sayed's case, too, the government moved to dismiss his case. But the judge did not grant the motion, McGoldrick said. Instead, the judge ordered McGoldrick to file a brief in opposition to the dismissal in 10 days and scheduled a hearing on the merits of Sayed's asylum claim for September.\n\nThe government's argument for dismissal in Sayed's case was that his notice to appear in court was \"improvidently issued,\" but the government did not explain what was improper about it, McGoldrick said.\n\nBecause the case hasn't been dismissed yet, Sayed is not yet in an expedited removal status, McGoldrick said. But, the lawyer added, Sayed has already asked the ICE agents for a credible fear interview, which migrants slated for expedited removal are entitled to to determine whether they might be eligible for asylum.\n\n\"He was very happy to find out that the whole social media thing was blowing up,\" McGoldrick said of Sayed, whom he visited at ICE's Otay Mesa Detention Center in California on Sunday. \"It was kind of emotional for me when he said, 'You know, I never knew that in America I'd be put in a room where I have to sleep in the same room where I go to the bathroom.' He's really, really disappointed about how he's being treated, as you can imagine. He was expecting a lot more.\"\n\nA third brother who worked with Sayed and the murdered brother was granted asylum in the United States earlier this year. Sayed's wife and their two children are in hiding in a foreign country, McGoldrick said.\n\nSayed's case has attracted some attention in Congress.\n\n\"This is unacceptable,\" Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats posted on social media this week. \"Our war effort relied on Afghans like this individual to stand up to the Taliban in support of our troops and diplomats. To abandon them now, once they have finally found safety in the United States, is simply unconscionable.\"\n\nTrump, who set the U.S. military's withdrawal from Afghanistan in motion with a deal with the Taliban in 2020, made criticism of the Biden administration's messy end to the withdrawal a centerpiece of his 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump brought family members of service members killed during the chaotic evacuation of U.S. troops out to endorse him during the Republican National Convention, and he visited Arlington National Cemetery around the third anniversary of the withdrawal in an episode that became engulfed in controversy when he posed for pictures in an area of the cemetery that bans political campaigning.\n\n\"Caused by Kamala Harris, Joe Biden, the humiliation in Afghanistan set off the collapse of American credibility and respect all around the world,\" Trump said last year during a speech to the National Guard Association.\n\nAsked how arresting Sayed comports with Trump's campaign rhetoric on Afghanistan, the White House referred Military.com to the Department of Homeland Security for comment.\n\n\"When taken in totality -- we have to look at what President Trump was saying on the campaign trail and during the withdrawal -- and we're only left to believe that he treats Afghans and veterans like, like political pawns,\" #AfghanEvac's VanDiver said. \"Because as soon as he's had an opportunity to do right by these folks, he shut down parole, he shut down TPS, he shut down Enduring Welcome, he shut down refugees, he shut down family reunifications. ...

A plurality of respondents, at 49 percent, said that they’re unsatisfied with current leaders. \n\nThe survey included over 4,200 respondents, including 1,293 Democrats, and was conducted earlier this month.\n\nThe poll comes at a time of crisis for the party. After Democrats suffered enormous losses in the 2024 election, many conservative and mainstream liberal analysts had pushed a false narrative that Democrats lost because they hadn’t gone far enough to the right and embraced more of Republicans’ outright fascist viewpoints.\n\nThis has consistently been shown to be untrue when voters have been surveyed about their views on key issues. Indeed, the Reuters/Ipsos polling suggested that Democrats want party leaders to go further left on a wide variety of economic and social issues.\n\nFor instance, roughly 4 in 5 Democrats or more said that they want the party to prioritize universal health care, affordable child care, and raising taxes on the rich. A smaller majority of respondents said that the party actually prioritizes such issues.\n\nBut in reality, the majority of federally elected Democrats actually oppose proposals like Medicare for All, and many party leaders have actively worked to sabotage support for such ideas. Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vermont) Medicare for All bill introduced this year, for instance, only had 15 cosponsors out of 47 Democrats in the caucus — Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (New York) not being one of them.\n\nFar from taxing the rich, party leaders have also cozied up to billionaires — with some in the party recently suggesting that Democrats should court Elon Musk, friend of neo-Nazis and white supremacists, during his public breakup with President Donald Trump this month.\n\nSchumer and other leaders like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries have faced intense scrutiny in recent months in particular, with both leaders having been effectively absent as the Trump administration has escalated its violent and authoritarian tactics both domestically and worldwide. \n\nFor instance, opposing war with Iran could be a major boon for Democrats, as the prospect is extremely unpopular among Americans, recent polls have found, who strongly favor diplomatic options. And yet, as Trump has threatened to directly declare war on Iran, Schumer and Jeffries have egged him on. Figures like Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, meanwhile, have been totally silent; Harris, after all, named Iran as the U.S.’s top enemy on the campaign trail last year.\n\nThe importance of opposing the war and embracing other left-leaning issues seems to be understood by one party leader, David Hogg — who, tellingly, was recently ousted from his position as vice chair of the Democratic National Committee after he criticized the party for its complacency in the face of the Trump administration.\n\n“Any Democrat who supports this war with Iran needs to be primaried,” said Hogg on social media this week. “Our generation grew up going through two multi trillion dollar wars we should have never been involved in. We are not fucking going back to that. If you think this is a good idea, read a history book.”","summary":"Democrats recently ousted David Hogg from leadership after he criticized the party for complacency.","url":"https://truthout.org/articles/62-percent-of-democrats-want-current-party-leaders-to-be-replaced-poll-finds/","image":"https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/06/2025_0620-schumer-jeffries-scaled.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 18:49:13","author":"Sharon Zhang","authors":["Sharon Zhang"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.365},{"id":333543828,"title":"Democrats Chances of Flipping Virginia as Spanberger Gets Fundraising Boost","text":"Democrat Abigail Spanberger has built up a fundraising and polling advantage over Republican Winsome Earle-Sears in Virginia's gubernatorial race.Newsweek reached out to the Spanberger and Earle-Sears campaigns for comment via email.Why It MattersVirginia's gubernatorial race will be one of the first major electoral tests for Republicans during the Trump 2.0 era. Once a major battleground, Virginia has shifted toward Democrats over the past 20 years, though Republicans have proved competitive in the state's off-year gubernatorial races.The election will measure whether Republicans can hold onto people who shifted toward President Donald Trump in 2024, including Latino, Asian American and younger voters—or whether Democrats are winning them back before the 2026 midterms, when a third of senators and all members of the House of Representatives are up for reelection.What to KnowSpanberger, a former member of Congress, is set to face off against Earle-Sears, the state's lieutenant governor, in the November race. Republican Governor Glenn Youngkin, who narrowly won four years earlier, is ineligible to run for reelection due to term limits.Spanberger raised more than $6.5 million from April to June and still has $14 million in the bank, according to data from the Virginia State Board of Elections. During that same period, Earle-Sears raised about $3.5 million with a closing balance of just under $3 million.Both were unopposed for their party's nomination. Primary elections were held on Tuesday for other offices such as lieutenant governor and attorney general. State Senator Ghazala Hashmi and former Delegate Jay Jones won the Democratic nominees for lieutenant governor and attorney general.Incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares did not face a primary challenge for his reelection. WRVA radio host John Reid was unopposed in the Republican lieutenant governor primary.Polls have shown Spanberger with a lead over Earle-Sears for the general election.A poll conducted by co/efficient for Founders Insight earlier this month showed Spanberger with a 3-point lead over Earle-Sears (46 percent to 43 percent).Spanberger was viewed favorably by 45 percent of respondents, compared to 40 percent who viewed Earle-Sears favorably. Twenty-seven percent of respondents viewed each unfavorably. Seventeen percent were unsure of how they felt about Spanberger, while 11 percent said they had not heard of her. Meanwhile, 20 percent were unsure of their feelings toward Earle-Sears, and 13 percent had never heard of her, the poll found.It surveyed 1,127 likely voters from June 8 to June 10, 2025 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.12 percentage points.Some polls have suggested Spanberger has a more substantial lead in the race.A Roanoke College poll found that 43 percent of respondents were planning to vote for Spanberger, compared to 26 percent leaning toward Earle-Sears. It still found that 28 percent were undecided, meaning it could narrow depending on how that sizable chunk of voters skews.An earlier Roanoke poll found Spanberger with 39 percent, with Earle-Sears receiving support from 24 percent. It surveyed 690 residents from February 17 to February 20, 2025 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.66 percentage points.It surveyed 609 registered voters from May 12 to May 19, 2025 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 5.3 percentage points.Virginia backed Vice President Kamala Harris by nearly six percentage points in the 2024 presidential race, a slightly stronger showing for Trump than against Biden in 2020, when he lost by about 10 points. The state also has two Democratic senators. Historically, the party that loses the presidency gets a boost in the following gubernatorial race, but how strong that may be for Spanberger could depend on Trump's approval.What People Are SayingPeyton Vogel, an Earle-Sears spokesperson, told The Associated Press: \"Clearly the Spanberger campaign needs a lot of help attempting to erase Abigail's bad voting record on issues that actually matter to Virginians. This race isn't being bought—it's being built on a message that matters.\"Veteran political scientist Larry Sabato previously told Newsweek: \"The early bet is on Spanberger but it's way too early to bet unless you have money to burn—or extra eggs to give away. Too many things can happen. If Trump is very unpopular as he was in 2017, it's bound to help Spanberger as it helped [Former Governor Ralph] Northam in 2017. Just like Youngkin was assisted by Biden's unpopularity in 2021.\"What Happens NextThe general election in Virginia is set for November 4, 2025. The Cook Political Report classifies the race as Lean Democrat, meaning it is \"considered competitive races,\" but that Spanberger \"has an advantage.\"","summary":"Democrat Abigail Spanberger is outraising Republican Lt.

A federal contracting officer and three businessmen have pleaded guilty in a scheme involving bribes like cash, NBA tickets, and a country club wedding in a scandal the Department of Justice (DOJ) said was part of a $550 million scam, Fox News Chief Washington Correspondent Mike Emanuel reported Friday. Roderick Watson, 57, worked as a USAID contracting officer, according to a DOJ press release, and pleaded guilty to \"bribery of a public official.\" According to the DOJ, Watson sold his influence starting in 2013, with contractors Walter Barnes, owner of Vistant, and Darryl Britt, owner of Apprio, funneling payoffs through subcontractor Paul Young to hide their tracks. RISCH URGES 'TOP TO BOTTOM' USAID SPENDING REVIEW AFTER WASTE, FRAUD EXPOSED \"During the scheme, Britt and Barnes paid bribes to Watson that were often concealed by passing them through Young, who was the president of another subcontractor to Apprio and Vistant,\" the press release explained. \"Britt and Barnes also regularly funneled bribes to Watson, including cash, laptops, thousands of dollars in tickets to a suite at an NBA game, a country club wedding, downpayments on two residential mortgages, cellular phones, and jobs for relatives. The bribes were also often concealed through electronic bank transfers falsely listing Watson on payroll, incorporated shell companies, and false invoices. Watson is alleged to have received bribes valued at more than approximately $1 million as part of the scheme.\" THOUSANDS OF USAID TERMINATIONS TO TAKE EFFECT BY SEPTEMBER IN AGENCY'S FINAL LEG OF 'DRAWDOWN' Vistant was awarded in November 2023, as part of a joint venture, a contract worth up to $800 million with one of the focuses of that contract being to address \"a variety of issues affecting the root causes of irregular migration from Central America to the United States,\" an issue that President Joe Biden tasked then-Vice President Kamala Harris with during his presidency. Several days later, that contract was canceled after USAID published a notice that said Vistant was excluded from government contracting due to \"evidence of conduct of a lack of business honesty or integrity.\" The joint venture then successfully sued the government over being put on that exclusion list and was re-awarded the contract and given a $10,000 payment in August 2024. \"Corruption in government programs will not be tolerated. Watson abused his position of trust for personal gain while federal contractors engaged in a pay-to-play scheme,\" Acting Assistant Inspector General for Investigations Sean Bottary of the USAID Office of Inspector General (USAID-OIG) said in the press release. \"USAID-OIG is firmly committed to rooting out fraud and corruption within U.S. foreign assistance programs. Today’s announcement underscores our unwavering focus on exposing criminal activity, including bribery schemes by those entrusted to faithfully award government contracts. We appreciate our longstanding partnership with the Department of Justice in holding accountable those who defraud American taxpayers.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP USAID was one of the public faces and most drastic examples of DOGE's efforts to cut waste, fraud, and abuse in government, and the effort resulted in the agency's programs being cut by 83%, while the programs deemed vital were moved to the State Department. USAID's website went dark, and employees were barred from entering its headquarters on Feb. 3, while others had their work put on hold. The Trump administration then announced that all USAID direct-hire personnel would be put on administrative leave. The agency came under fire for many funding choices, including allocating $1.5 million for a program that sought to \"advance diversity, equity and inclusion in Serbia’s workplaces and business communities\" and a $70,000 program for a \"DEI musical\" in Ireland. During DOGE's sweep, it was revealed that U.S. dollars were ending up in the hands of terror-linked groups, such as funds reportedly providing \"full funding\" for al-Qaeda terrorist Anwar al-Awlaki to attend college in Colorado, Fox News Digital previously reported. As DOGE was dismantling USAID, many Democrats and media outlets blasted the cuts, claiming they would harm impoverished recipients of aid across the globe and some, including U2 frontman Bono, who said the cuts would lead to over 300,000 deaths. Several House and Senate Democrats protested outside of USAID's headquarters in early February, expressing outrage over the layoffs and cuts, The Hill reported. \"Anybody who cares about good and effective government should be concerned about the waste, fraud, and abuse in government agencies, including USAID,\" Matthew R. Galeotti, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, said in the DOJ's press release.

Here’s how it works.\n\n(Image credit: NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nUS President Donald Trump has once again pushed back a deadline requiring TikTok to be sold by its Chinese owner, Bytedance. Last year the US passed a law requiring either a sale or that the app be banned. This marks the third time that Trump has extended the deadline.\n\nTrump signed the executive order yesterday, which does raise the question of whether TikTok will ever be forced into the sale: under this administration, at least. Trump did try to force TikTok's sale during his first term, in 2020, but late last year decided it was great, actually: \"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok, because I won youth by 34 points.\"\nTrump is here referring to TikTok's impact on the US Presidential election, which remains unclear. His claim to have won \"youth by 34 points\" has been debunked by multiple fact-checkers: Trump obviously won the election overall, but Democratic candidate Kamala Harris outperformed him among younger voters.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMore tariff chaos: Donald Trump pauses tariffs for most countries at the last minute but jacks them up to 125% against China, 'effective immediately,' because of their 'lack of respect'\n\nNever mind, President Trump truths on Truth Social that electronics (including from China) are still subject to tariffs\n\nYes a US court has blocked Trump's tariffs but PC hardware isn't out of the water just yet\n\nAnyway. Following Trump's decision, TikTok issued this statement: \"We are grateful for President Trump's leadership and support in ensuring that TikTok continues to be available for more than 170 million American users and 7.5 million U.S. businesses that rely on the platform as we continue to work with Vice President Vance's Office.\"\n\nAll sounds very cosy. US Lawmakers had argued that TikTok posed a threat to national security, and that Bytedance could be forced to hand over data on US users to Beijing (both of which TikTok denies). The ban was first passed by Congress before being upheld by the Supreme Court: Trump extended the ban on January 20, again in April, and the third extension pushes the date for a deal or sale back to September 17. Any deal is likely to need Beijing's approval.\n\n(Image credit: Anna Moneymaker via Getty Images)\n\"[Trump's] making an extension so we can get this deal done,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters. \"It’s wildly popular. He also wants to protect Americans’ data and privacy concerns on this app. And he believes we can do both at the same time.\"\nThe decision has been criticised by Democrats. \"Once again, the Trump administration is flouting the law and ignoring its own national security findings about the risks posed by a PRC-controlled TikTok,\" said Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Vice Chairman Mark Warner. \"An executive order can't sidestep the law, but that's exactly what the president is trying to do.\"\n\nThe biggest gaming news, reviews and hardware deals\nKeep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team.\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\nWith this third delay, the Tiktok situation is now a \"deadline purgatory,\" analyst Jeremy Goldman told the AP, \"starting to feel less like a ticking clock and more like a looped ringtone.

And so, I just felt that that's something that she needed to do differentiate what a Harris administration would look like as opposed to a Biden administration and she didn't have the answer that I expected.\n\nI expected her answer to be something like, “We have won. We have this win, this win, this win, this win. We've been more successful than any other administration in decades, and so I intend to build on those wins.

I'm going to do things differently through the my life experience.’\n\nBut – I mean, doesn't that sound like a good answer? Like, I just assume that was the answer and then I- I didn't get that. And now Jake Tapper wrote it in his book.\n\nFARAH GRIFFIN: It's honestly in every 2024 recap book as kind of the moment, but it speaks – \n\nHOSTIN: I feel terrible.\n\nHAINES: Sunny, you’re in the history books.\n\nFARAH GRIFFIN: It speaks to how – you are in the history books.\n\nTETA: The relevance of The View.\n\nFARAH GRIFFIN: Speaks to how important this show is though. It is where presidential candidates come and make their way or they fail and don't meet the moment.\n\nTETA: Yeah, I don't really –\n\nHOSTIN: Thanks for bringing that up, Brian.\n\nTETA: No problem! Do you – Here's another question. Do you guys believe that really did change the election? I don't think so.\n\nHAINES: I don't think it was the, I think it was –\n\nHOSTIN [to the audience]: No, right?\n\nAUDIENCE: No.\n\nFARAH GRIFFIN: I think it – I think it played a role. They put so much – the Trump campaign put so much ad money behind that specific clip. And what they were trying to do is tie her to Biden's unfavorabilities, but more than that just simply the right track, wrong track of the election.\n\nSo, even people who might be kind of neutral on Biden, that – it was something like 67 percent of the country felt like the country was going the wrong way. So, they used it to say, ‘well, she's not gonna do anything different.’ It wasn't any one thing, but they use – they really were able to use it.\n\nHAINES: It was not only separating her – didn't separate her from Biden. It also was fueling the narrative like she doesn't know what she's doing, like what does she stand for? She doesn't think it and it just like gave them the commercial.\n\nHOSTIN: Thanks Sarah.","summary":"It’s been haunting her months. Just weeks before Election Day 2024, Kamala Harris fangirl and co-host of ABC’s The View, Sunny Hostin accidentally torpedoed the Democratic ticket with a simple question to distinguish herself from President Biden. During a live recording of their The View’s Behind the Table podcast on Wednesday, executive producer Brian Teta and rest of the cast poked fun at her for finally getting in the history books, as Hostin squirmed.\n\nAs NewsBusters reported at the time, Hostin’s question was simple but Harris whiffed in spectacular fashion (Click “expand”):\n\n\nHOSTIN: And he said there wasn't a single thing that he did that you could not do.

Meanwhile, Harris has consistently polled between 29 percent and 36 percent, suggesting a solid and stable base of support.Among specific demographic groups such as moderates and voters under 55—Newsom has also lagged behind. Among moderates, he holds only 7 percent of the vote, compared to Harris's 31 percent. Among younger voters, Harris leads with 30 percent, while Newsom trails at just 8 percent.Harris also dominates key demographic segments that are crucial in Democratic primaries. She has overwhelming support among Black voters (44 percent), Hispanic voters (36 percent), and women (36 percent). Newsom polls at just 9 percent, 11 percent, and 6 percent in those groups, respectively.His strongest demographic performance is among white voters (9 percent) and men (11 percent), but even there, he is far behind Harris, who gets 25 percent of white voters and 21 percent of men.It comes as Newsom has attempted to increase public visibility in recent months, launching a podcast featuring conversations with conservative figures like Charlie Kirk and Steve Bannon, signaling an attempt to broaden his appeal beyond traditional Democratic bases. He also announced that he would sue the Trump administration over the so-called \"Liberation Day\" tariffs, which ignited stock market volatility.He has also shifted some of his rhetoric toward the political center, including proposing cuts to health care for immigrants without legal status, and revealing that he is against transgender athletes competing in women's events, both of which drew backlash from other members of his party.Despite these moves, his national profile has not surged, with some polls showing little appetite for a 2028 bid from Newsom.An Emerson College Polling/Inside California Politics/The Hill survey, conducted between April 12 and April 14 among 1,000 California registered voters, found that 59 percent of respondents said they don't think that Newsom should run for president in 2028, with 41 percent supporting a bid for the Oval Office.Meanwhile, a poll, conducted by co/efficient between May 7 and May 9 among 1,462 likely voters, found that just 2 percent of voters see Newsom as the face of the Democratic Party.The poll showed that Ocasio-Cortez is viewed by more Democratic voters as the face of the party than any other figure, with 26 percent naming her—matching the 26 percent who said \"no one\" currently holds that title.Ocasio-Cortez has not formally announced a presidential bid for 2028.In a recent interview, Newsom expressed ambivalence about a presidential bid, telling the Los Angeles Times: \"I have to have a burning why, and I have to have a compelling vision that distinguishes myself from anybody else. Without that, without both...I don't deserve to even be in the conversation.\"What Happens NextIt is not clear when presidential hopefuls will begin announcing their bids for 2028.The Democratic Primary to challenge for the White House in 2028 is likely to be a crowded field. In 2020, the last time Democrats had an open primary, more than a dozen Democrats launched White House bids.","summary":"Newsom has long been considered a potential 2028 White House contender, but his polling has remained relatively flat in recent months.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-gavin-newsom-2028-poll-2088476","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2667866/harris-newsom.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-20 16:32:32","author":"Martha McHardy","authors":["Martha McHardy"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.034},{"id":333496066,"title":"National Republicans Commit $2 Million to Regain Virginia House as Democrats Hold Fundraising Lead","text":"Last week, the national organization dedicated to electing Republicans to state offices announced that it was committing $2 million to Republicans in the Virginia House of Delegates to use toward taking back the House majority. What will that Republican State Leadership Committee money do, and will it be enough to help overcome Democrats’ already substantial fundraising lead?\n\nAccording to the Virginia Public Access Project, Republicans raised roughly $2.2 million less than Democrats for House races in the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe Daily Signal spoke to Republican Party chair state Sen. Mark Peake, who told us that the state party was hoping to use that money to target three or four seats that it hopes to flip from the Democrats based on President Donald Trump’s electoral performance in 2024.\n\nHowever, Republicans are also faced with a Democratic Party campaign to flip 12 House seats to them, meaning Republicans will need to “play defense” for those seats, which will also cost a good deal of that money.\n\nA party insider told us that realistically, the number of seats they will have to defend is closer to six or seven, but we have already seen that the Democratic Party war chest is likely going to be much bigger than the GOP’s.\n\nRepublican Del. Kim Taylor from the 82nd District (parts of Petersburg and Prince George County) will be one of the most targeted seats by the Democrats because she won the newly redrawn district in 2023 by just 54 votes and Vice President Kamala Harris carried the district in 2024 with 51.5% of the vote.\n\n>>> Sign up for our Virginia email newsletter\n\nTaylor’s campaign has already spent the second highest amount of all House races of either party in the second quarter, only behind her opponent, Democrat Kimberly Adams. Adams has outraised Taylor 3-to-1 already this year. Two years ago, this district saw one of the top three most expensive House races in recent Virginia history, and it appears to be on track to top that, despite Taylor’s huge disadvantage in fundraising.\n\nOne veteran Virginia politician told The Daily Signal that “it’s way early to be burning through campaign money” like Taylor is, since early voting in the general election is not scheduled until September.\n\nIronically, Democrat U.S. Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner have played a role in this, whether intentionally or not, when they recommended House of Delegates Minority Leader Todd Gilbert for the position of U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia, leading to Gilbert’s decision to step down from Republican caucus leadership while the vetting process is occurring.\n\nDel. Terry Kilgore has taken the reins of the caucus. Kilgore is who will determine the distribution of the Republican State Leadership Committee contribution.\n\nWhen contacted about that, Kilgore’s office told The Daily Signal that it wouldn’t discuss those matters, which certainly makes tactical sense. With the Democratic Party claiming to target 12 House seats, the concern is that Democrats will dictate what strategy the GOP takes.\n\nPolitical resource management has historically been a touchy business among the Virginia GOP. With a scarcity of funds, comparatively good candidates often fall prey to decisions on things like “likelihood of winning” when the party and political action committees decide where to direct money and other resources.\n\nThe “likelihood of winning” factor frequently looks at a campaign’s internal fundraising, and if the numbers aren’t meeting expectations, resources may be directed elsewhere.\n\nThat is where the fundraising numbers paint a less rosy picture for candidates like Taylor who have not had the fundraising success that a campaign like former Republican Del. Tim Anderson from Virginia Beach has had or a war chest like Republicans Carrie Coyner in Chesterfield or Amanda Batten in Williamsburg have.\n\nKilgore’s question will have to be, if they had more money, would it help them to raise more money?","summary":"Last week, the national organization dedicated to electing Republicans to state offices announced that it was committing $2 million to Republicans in the Virginia House...
