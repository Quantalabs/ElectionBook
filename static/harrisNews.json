On “Piers Morgan Uncensored,” the British journalist asked Carducci whether she agreed with the president.\n\n“What I would love to discuss actually is — ” Carducci began.\n\n“No, no, can you just answer the question, please? Just answer. Please answer the question,” Morgan interrupted.\n\nCarducci argued with the British journalist, saying she did not believe it was an issue that concerned the majority of Americans, prompting Morgan to repeatedly ask her to answer his question.

We’re not talking about the price of gas. We’re not talking about the cost of living or what the stock market did yesterday,” Carducci said. “This is an issue, Piers, which impacts such a small percentage of the American people. The American people care about the cost of living. They care about the price of eggs. They care about the stock market crashing. These are the things they care about, Piers.”\n\nMorgan continued to ask Carducci to answer his original question before ultimately requesting that she be muted as he directed the question to another guest, Brian Shapiro.\n\n“Mute her for a moment please,” Morgan said. “If you’re not going to answer the question, I’m going to mute you. Let me bring in Brian.”\n\n“Sorry, this is ridiculous. Can we just, please, Jojo has refused to answer my question. Let me ask Brian,” Morgan said. “Brian, do you agree with what Trump did about trans athletes in women’s sport? Do you agree it was unfair and impacts young women?”\n\nShapiro said that he would answer Morgan’s question if he had “45 seconds” to address the issue.\n\n“No, no. I just want to answer the question. You can’t keep doing that! You can’t all keep doing pre-planned speeches about something else,” Morgan said.\n\n“I’m answering your question directly,” Shapiro said. “If you’re born a man, transition to a woman, I have never believed that you should be on the same playing field as a woman. However, this is not a top five issue or a top 10 issue in polls around the country. No, it’s not. In what poll, Piers? In what poll?”\n\n“You know what it comes under? Do any of you know what it comes under?” Morgan asked before Carducci could be heard attempting to answer his question. “You’ve had your chance, you didn’t answer the question. I’m talking to Brian. The point is, Brian, it comes under this umbrella.”\n\n“It comes under the umbrella of common sense, what Trump calls a commonsense revolution. He says America is no longer going to be woke. That resonated, I think, third with people in America,” Morgan added. “Here’s why. Because they had that one advert. You may remember Kamala’s for they/them. Donald Trump’s for you. The New York Times, a liberal newspaper, said that could have moved the needle in the election by three.”\n\nDuring the closing months of Trump’s campaign, the president’s team released ads highlighting former Vice President Kamala Harris’ support for funding transgender surgeries, as she had been an advocate for the procedures for illegal immigrants and for cutting funding to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In a September 2024 interview, Harris’ communications director, Michael Tyler, refused to walk back her support for transgender surgeries, calling the focus on her previous stance a ‘complete distraction.’\n\nA Harvard CAPS Harris Poll conducted between Feb. 19 and Feb. 20 shows 69% of Americans surveyed said they support “banning men who have undergone operations and hormones to become women from girls’ sports.” Of the majority of support, 50% were Democrats, 86% were Republicans and 70% were either independents or other, according to the data.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

You’ve gotta say that!” Slotkin said, mimicking the outside voices that began bombarding her office moments after her selection was announced last week. “I’m not gonna make my speech a Christmas tree of every single issue of the Democratic Party,” the senator added, shaking her head, “because that’s what helped get us in this position in the first place.”\n\nI have known Slotkin since 2018, when she first ran for Congress as an ex-CIA officer attempting to flip a safe Republican seat in southeast Michigan. Having covered her rise in the years since—including embedding with her operation during the 2020 campaign—I knew she possessed fundamental, long-festering concerns about the Democratic Party’s brand. Slotkin feared that, to the extent that Democrats stood for anything in the eyes of the electorate, it was a blur of abstract, ideologically charged activism that was hopelessly detached from kitchen-table concerns.\n\nLast November, even as she won her own race for Michigan’s open Senate seat, Slotkin’s worst-case scenario came to pass. Trump reclaimed the White House—this time with wholly subservient Republican majorities in Congress—and Democrats were heading deep into a cold, dark political wilderness. A fight over the future of the party was imminent; when Slotkin, barely six weeks on the job, was chosen to deliver the Democratic response to Trump’s prime-time address, it seemed likely that the first shots would soon be fired. This is how I came to be chatting with Slotkin yesterday, in the hours before the biggest moment of her political career.\n\nA week earlier, when she was summoned to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office, Slotkin wondered whether she was in trouble. She is one of several freshmen in the Democratic caucus who came over from the House, where intra-party politics are a comparative blood sport, and she thought maybe she’d already ruffled some feathers. If she had, Schumer approved: He wanted Slotkin to speak for the party in prime time. She recalls feeling stunned, then honored, and finally somewhat mortified. “It’s typically thought of,” she told me, “as a cursed speech.” Slotkin asked for the day to think it over before ultimately accepting Schumer’s offer.\n\nEscaping quickly thereafter to her family’s farm in Holly, Michigan, the senator holed up with a few trusted staffers to begin preparations. Two decisions needed to be made: substance and setting. Slotkin had no shortage of metaphor-rich locations from which she could stage the event: her farm, representing everyman roots; nearby Detroit, with its diversity and manufacturing iconography; the Canadian border, to underscore the chaos being unleashed by Trump’s new tariffs. But the senator never truly entertained any of these possibilities. To her, the questions of substance and setting were one and the same. Slotkin wanted to showcase a message that was built to do one thing—win tough elections—and that meant going to a place where she’d done just that.\n\nDriving the main drag of Wyandotte, Michigan (population: 24,057), yesterday afternoon, I couldn’t help but notice the bait shops and dive bars and white dudes with tattoos on their necks. This place would appear, to the typical Democratic consultant parachuting into its downtown, like a lost cause. One of several manufacturing villages clustered along the Detroit River just south of the city, Wyandotte is the kind of place—working class, culturally conservative, racially homogenous—that has turned new shades of red in the Trump era. And yet, this past November, both Trump and Slotkin won here: Each of the candidates carried seven of the city’s 10 precincts, a rare example of ticket splitting in one of the nation’s premier battleground states.\n\nSlotkin’s formula has never been a secret. Her campaign for Senate last year—essentially a scaled-up version of her three heavily contested and tactically celebrated campaigns for the House—was built around one organizing theme: the middle class. Everything she talks about, be it health-care costs or the January 6 insurrection, comes back to the economic security of everyday Americans. Slotkin argues that the surest way to heal the country—to defuse identitarian struggles, pacify the culture wars, uncoil our hypertense politics—is by restoring the confidence of working families. When people feel assured of their financial welfare and of their children’s future, she insists, they become far less receptive to the type of strongman demagoguery that thrives on scapegoats and feasts on anxiety.\n\nThis approach sets Slotkin apart from many of her fellow Democrats, though the difference is better measured by degree than kind. She is quite familiar—as a woman, as a Jew, as the daughter of a woman who came out late in life as a lesbian—with the plight of certain constituencies within her party’s coalition. It’s simply a matter of emphasis: Slotkin sees electoral success as the path to addressing America’s injustices, not the other way around.\n\nThis is what brought her to a sleepy event space in Wyandotte (the owners, fearing political retaliation, requested that I not reveal the name of the business). It’s also what brought Slotkin to reject all of the suggestions she received about her speech: that she should use it to take up the cause of USAID workers, of undocumented immigrants, of the transgender community, of the environment, of the Education Department, and so on. The problem isn’t with any of these particular causes, she said; the problem is that everyone seemed focused more on the people she might name in her remarks and less on the people who would be at home listening to them.\n\n“There are a lot of people, including in this town, who will never scream on the internet, who will never go to a rally, who will never get involved in partisan politics, but just want their government to run,” Slotkin said. “I’m speaking to them—not to just the hardcore base of the party. And if they wanted someone to speak to the hardcore base of the party, they picked the wrong gal.”\n\nThere would be no performative shout-outs, no box-checking patronage. As the envoy for a party that has long operated as a syndicate of identity-based advocacy groups, Slotkin wanted to try something different. Charged with countering 100 minutes of Trump’s trademark fanfaronade, the senator aimed to use the fewest words possible to speak to the largest number of Americans she could. Slotkin would talk, for just 10 minutes, about bringing prices down, holding American values up, and remaining civically engaged.\n\nNone of this would seem a revolutionary approach to rhetoric. Still, it was fraught with risk all the same: Democrats “have been on their heels since the election,” Slotkin told me, and the party faithful have been agitating since January 20 for someone, anyone, to stand up to Trump. The announcement of Slotkin had already been met with grumbling from progressives online; anything short of oratorical firebolts would confirm the complacent, feckless approach of the D.C. governing class.\n\nSlotkin viewed the stakes somewhat differently: This speech could, at least symbolically, commence a new chapter of Democratic Party opposition to a president whose success is inextricable from the tone-deaf ineptitude of Democratic Party opposition. If her team’s resistance to Trump’s first term was marked by hysteria and hashtags—all the land acknowledgments and pronoun policing and intersectionality initiatives—Slotkin saw on Tuesday night the opportunity to set a different tone.\n\nNaturally, not everyone was thrilled with what they heard. “Slotkin’s address suffered from the same half-heartedness that has seized the Democrats since last November,” my colleague Tom Nichols wrote in The Atlantic, capturing some of the criticism online. “Her response, and the behavior of the Democrats in general, showed that they still fear being a full-throated opposition party, because they believe that they will alienate voters who will somehow be offended at them for taking a stand against Trump’s schemes.”\n\nI suspect that Slotkin might cringe at being lumped in with “Democrats in general.” In truth, I’ve noticed a certain unease she feels with her partisan identity. She struggles to mask her contempt for far-left organizations; she has little patience for colleagues who, she once told me, run Very Online campaigns in safely blue districts that blind them to the reality of what it takes to earn a ticket split from Republicans.\n\nWatching Tuesday evening as she rehearsed in front of staffers, I noticed that only once did she identify herself as a Democrat—in the final line of the speech. As we spoke a few minutes later, in a cramped corridor just beyond the set, I asked whether that was intentional.\n\n“I think, at least in this part of the world, there’s real skepticism about Democrats. That they’re weak—” she paused, perhaps noticing her usage of the third-person plural.\n\nSlotkin continued: “That we’re too careful … That we’re …” She trailed off.\n\n“Weird?” I asked.\n\n“Weird,” she confirmed. Slotkin rolled her eyes. “Whatever. I’m just trying to be the opposite of that. You know, my campaign motto was ‘Team Normal.’ And I think that’s still what I’m trying to do. And I think that that represents a bigger part of the country than people actually know.”\n\nThe president’s speech would not begin for nearly an hour, but already I could detect a certain angst in Slotkin’s voice. It had nothing to do with her own speech; she had run through it half a dozen times that day, pausing and tinkering and restarting until she knew it was fully cooked. Instead, like a family member preemptively contrite for what their relatives might say or do at the Thanksgiving table, Slotkin betrayed an apprehension about how her fellow Democrats might respond to Trump.\n\nAs it turned out, she was right to worry. Between all the awkward and impotent demonstrations—Representative Al Green of Texas angrily waving his cane at the president; some pink-clad lawmakers protesting silently with popsicle-stick signs; others staging a disordered walkout during the speech—verdicts were rendered about the party’s pitiable state before its messenger could even say her piece.\n\nNot that Slotkin paid that verdict much mind. After her speech, the senator and her team were headed down the street to a Teamster bar, and Slotkin told me the highest praise they hoped to hear from the owner and his patrons was: “That sounded pretty normal.”\n\nPerceptions of her party were never going to shift in one night. Slotkin came into Tuesday accepting, if not explicitly addressing, the realities of the brutal two-front war in which she is now a high-profile combatant: opposing Trump’s executive and legislative blitzkrieg while simultaneously battling with other Democrats who have their own visions for returning the party to power.\n\nSlotkin insists that she isn’t “one of the 100 people” preparing to seek the Democratic Party’s nomination for president in 2028. She was chosen to speak Tuesday night for a more compelling reason: She wins, time after time, in places where other members of her party simply cannot. If they want to model her success at the ballot box, Slotkin told me, they should stop ignoring half the country.\n\n“It doesn’t win elections to just speak to the base of the party,” Slotkin said. “If it did, Kamala Harris would be president.”","summary":"The Michigan senator tries to reset the Democratic opposition to Trump.","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/elissa-slotkin-democratic-resistance/681933/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/S2GZSkeYitee5tOQeWzZ7X7kgfQ=/0x0:2000x1042/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/03/Elissa_Slotkin/original.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 23:43:53","author":"Tim Alberta","authors":["Tim Alberta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.402},{"id":297134958,"title":"See the first ad from Musk-backed PAC that highlights ‘four long years of humiliation’","text":"The political action committee started by Elon Musk has launched its first commercial, highlighting “four long years of humiliation” under the Biden administration.\n\nAmerica PAC aired the ad on Wednesday, shortly after Donald Trump delivered his address to a joint session of Congress.\n\n“After four long years of humiliation, a failure at home, and embarrassment abroad, our long, national nightmare is finally over,” the ad’s voiceover stated. “Strength is back, common sense is back, America is back.”\n\nPlaying underneath the voiceover is a compilation of clips, including of former president Joe Biden falling over, and other clips of former First Lady Jill Biden and former vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nThe minute-long commercial goes on to highlight Trump’s actions on the southern border, energy and foreign policy, and efforts to reduce the size of the federal government, since he returned to office on January 20.\n\nIt claims the new administration has delivered “the lowest level of illegal immigration in history” with criminal deportations and the hunting down of cartels.\n\n“He's draining the swamp, slashing billions in waste at home, while closing the spigot of American tax dollars to foreign regimes,” the ad says. “He’s taking on the ruling elite and returning the rule of the people.”\n\nAmerica PAC played a large role in supporting the president ahead of his victory in the November election.

In contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris waited to travel to America’s border with Mexico until about 22 weeks into her term. \n\nThe “border crisis under Biden’s administration” directly affected border communities, Vance said. “I’ve already heard heartbreaking stories of people who are still picking up the pieces, local mayors who are still dealing with the budgetary consequences of what the Joe Biden administration allowed to happen at the American southern border, and that too is something that President Trump is going to help address, help fix, and help solve, Vance pledged. \n\nSince Trump’s first day in office, the president has used his executive authority to undo the border policies of the previous administration. \n\nTrump ended the catch and release policy and reinstated the “Remain in Mexico” policy, which requires migrant to wait in Mexico until their asylum claim can be heard. Trump also discontinued the CBP One mobile application established under the Biden administration as a tool of mass parole. \n\nIn February, the first full month of the Trump administration, there were 8,326 illegal alien encounters at the southern border, compared with the same month in previous years: 189,913 in 2024; 156,630 in 2023; and 166,010 in 2022, according to Customs and Border Protection. \n\nThe Associated Press reports that migrants who were headed for the U.S. southern border have turned around and gone home following news of Trump’s crackdown on illegal crossings. In the first 11 days of Trump’s term, illegal alien apprehensions fell 93%, according to ABC News. \n\nAt the end of February, a Department of Homeland Security spokesperson told National Review that federal authorities had removed 55,000 illegal immigrants since the start of the Trump administration on Jan. 20. \n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement’s monthly arrests increased 627% under Trump compared with the last year of the Biden administration, according to the Department of Homeland Security. \n\nThe U.S. federal government and Mexico have surged resources to the southern border over the past six weeks, with Mexico announcing the deployment of 10,000 troops to its border with the U.S. The Pentagon announced last week that it will send an additional 3,000 active-duty troops and other resources, including black hawk helicopters, to the U.S. southern border. \n\nU.S. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard accompanied Vance on his border trip, because, as Vance noted, the solving the border crisis requires coordination and partnership across government department. \n\n“As President Trump has made clear,” Hegseth said, “border security is national security.” \n\nVance called it unfortunate that the situation at the border “has become a matter of national intelligence.” \n\nLike Hegseth, Gabbard expressed commitment to use the resources of her department to secure the border. \n\n“Our mission is very clear,” Gabbard said, “our objective is to keep the American people safe.”","summary":"There is both “bad news and some good news” from America’s southern border with Mexico, Vice President JD Vance told reporters Wednesday.   Vance visited...

Veterans have shown up at town hall-style meetings to voice their anger, and groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars are mobilizing against cuts.\n\nThe department is considering a reorganization that could include cutting 80,000 jobs, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nVeterans were much likelier to support Trump, a Republican, than Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in November’s presidential election, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states. Nearly 6 in 10 voters who are veterans backed Trump, while about 4 in 10 voted for Harris.\n\nJoy Ilem, national legislative director for the nonpartisan group Disabled American Veterans, said her group was studying how the ongoing cuts might affect care.\n\n\"You could lose trust among the veteran population over some of these things that have happened and the way that they’ve happened,” Ilem warned. “And we do fear damage to the recruitment and retention of hiring the best and brightest to serve veterans.”\n\nThe White House said last week that it wants to slash $2 billion worth of VA contracts, which would affect anything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The department quickly paused the cuts following concerns about the impact on critical health services.\n\nVA Secretary Doug Collins told Fox News Channel this week that the effort was focused on “finding deficiencies.”\n\n“Anything that we're doing is designed and will not cut veterans' health or veterans' benefits that they've earned,” he said.\n\nIn a Tuesday statement to The Associated Press, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency “is putting Veterans at the center of everything the department does.”\n\n“Every dollar we spend on wasteful contracts, non-mission-critical or duplicative activities is one less dollar we can spend on Veterans, and given that choice, we will always side with the Veteran,” Kasperowicz wrote.\n\nRepublicans have pointed out that the VA has rehired employees who were let go during an initial round of layoffs in February, such as those working for a crisis hotline. However, during a subsequent round of layoffs, the VA cut 15 other employees who were in jobs supporting the crisis line, including a trainer for the phone responders, according to congressional staff who are tracking the cuts.\n\nThe VA has been plagued for years by allegations of poor medical care and excessively long wait times. Investigators a decade ago uncovered widespread problems in how VA hospitals were scheduling appointments after allegations that as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting care at the department's Phoenix hospital. A group of employees accused the department of retaliating against potential whistleblowers. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, eventually put into place a program allowing veterans to go outside the VA system to seek medical care. The Choice Program was extended by Trump during his first term.\n\nRichard Lamb, who was shot down twice in Vietnam as an Army helicopter crew chief, said the department should be “cut to the bone.”\n\nLamb, 74, said he broke vertebrae each time his helicopter was shot down. Decades passed, he said, before a VA doctor acknowledged he had compression fractures. Lamb later had a private doctor perform surgery on his back after he said the VA wouldn't perform the procedure.\n\n“I’d be happy to see VA, not torn down, but cleaned up, cleaned out and recast,” said Lamb, who lives in Waco, Texas. “The VA is supposed to be a wonderful thing for veterans. It’s not. It sucks.”\n\nDaniel Ragsdale Combs, a Navy veteran with a traumatic brain injury, strongly disagrees.\n\nRagsdale Combs, 45, suffered his injury while running to respond to an order on an aircraft carrier and striking his head above a hatchway. He receives group therapy for mental illness brought on by the injury but says he had heard those sessions might be canceled or reduced due to staffing shortages.\n\n“I’m deeply concerned because the VA has been nothing but great to me,” said Ragsdale Combs, who lives in Mesa, Arizona. “I’m angry, upset and frustrated.”\n\nLucy Wong relies on a team of VA doctors in the Phoenix area to treat her scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that attacks connective tissue. She said she developed the disease as a medical technician in the Navy in the 1980s, working with toxic chemicals and enduring extreme stress.\n\nDriving is difficult. She worries that the VA will cut Uber rides to her medical appointments, among other things.\n\n“I ask if Trump is cutting anything back here, and the reply is, ‘Not yet,’\" Wong said.\n\nJosh Ghering, a former Marine from Parsons, Kansas, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he had to fly to San Antonio for an appointment with a neurologist before he was medically retired for back issues, including herniated discs. He questioned why he couldn’t get the same appointment closer to home.\n\n“I think they’re headed in the right direction,” Ghering, 42, said of DOGE. “But they’re going to have to be more thorough with what it is they’re doing, to make sure they’re not cutting jobs that are needed.”\n\nThe nation’s service members have never been a political monolith — and the same holds true for their views on the VA. But the split between two Marines on opposite sides of the country raises a question not just about DOGE but about America's military: Who is expected to sacrifice?\n\nWatson, the former Marine in Georgia, sustained various injuries while serving, including a traumatic brain injury when a cable snapped and a crate fell on him. He said he's willing to accept fewer visits to his VA doctor and forgo other conveniences as a matter of service to the country.\n\n“Many veterans who voted for Trump understood this was going to be his policy and are now screaming bloody murder because the axe is going to fall upon the VA,” Watson said. “And to me, that’s just a little bit self-centered.”\n\nBafundo, the Marine in Washington state, pushed back against the idea that all Americans are making a sacrifice when, as he sees it, it's really falling back \"on the little guy.”\n\nAmerica’s billionaires won’t be shouldering any of the burden, he argued, while Musk, who's the world's richest person, and others pay little, if any, taxes.\n\n“If we’re going to sacrifice, the wealthy need to sacrifice, too,” he said. “And, frankly, they don’t.”\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that decades passed before a VA doctor acknowledged Lamb's compression fractures. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that a private doctor discovered the injury.\n\n© Copyright 2025 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

After viewing the Eagle Pass area, around 150 miles southwest of San Antonio, by helicopter, the trio visited a Border Patrol detention facility before participating in a roundtable discussion with local and national participants.\n\nState authorities say Vance’s itinerary also likely includes a visit to Shelby Park, a municipal greenspace along the Rio Grande that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott seized from federal authorities last year in a feud with the Biden administration. Abbott accused that administration of not doing enough to curb illegal crossings.\n\n“Border security is national security,” Hegseth told Fox News before the trip. He added, “We’re sending those folks home, and we’re not letting more in. And you’re seeing that right now.”\n\nTrump made a crackdown on immigration a centerpiece of his reelection campaign, pledging to halt the tide of migrants entering the U.S. and stop the flow of fentanyl crossing the border. As part of that effort, he imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, saying neither is doing enough to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration.\n\n“They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast,” Trump said of migrants living in the U.S. illegally as he delivered an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nAlthough Trump has not made a trip to the border since Inauguration Day, the visit of three of his top officials is evidence of the scope of his administration’s focus on the issue. He has tasked agencies across the federal government with working to overhaul border and immigration policy, moving well beyond the Department of Homeland Security, the traditional home of most such functions.\n\nArrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico plummeted 39% in January from a month earlier, though they’ve been falling sharply since well before Trump took office on Jan. 20 from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023. Since then, Mexican authorities increased enforcement within their own borders and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, introduced severe asylum restrictions early last summer.\n\nThe Trump administration has showcased its new initiatives, including putting shackled immigrants on U.S. military planes for deportation fights and sending some to the U.S. lockup at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. It has also expanded federal agents’ arrests of people in the U.S. illegally and abandoned programs that gave some permission to stay.\n\nTrump border czar Tom Homan said migrants with criminal records have been prioritized in early efforts to round up and deport people in the U.S. illegally, but he added of other migrants, “If you’re in the county illegally, you’re not off the table.”\n\n“When we find the bad guy, many times they’re with others, others who aren’t a criminal priority, but were in the country illegally,” Homan told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday. “They’re coming, too.”\n\nSince Trump’s second term began, about 6,500 new active duty forces have been ordered to deploy to the southern border. Before that, there were about 2,500 troops already there, largely National Guard troops on active duty orders, along with a couple of hundred active duty aviation forces.\n\nOf those being mobilized, many are still only preparing to go. Last weekend, Hegseth approved orders to send a large portion of an Army Stryker brigade and a general support aviation battalion to the border. Totaling about 3,000 troops, they are expected to deploy in the coming weeks.\n\nTroops are responsible for detection and monitoring along the border but don’t interact with migrants attempting to illegally cross. Instead, they alert border agents, who then take the migrants into custody.\n\nBiden tasked Vice President Kamala Harris with tackling the root causes of immigration during his administration, seeking to zero in on why so many migrants, particularly from Central America, were leaving their homelands and coming to the U.S. seeking asylum or trying to make it into the county illegally.\n\nHarris made her first visit to the border in June 2021, about 3 1/2 months deeper into Biden’s term than Vance’s trip in the opening weeks of Trump’s second term. Trump has routinely joked that Harris was in charge of immigration policy but didn’t visit the border or even maintain close phone contact with federal officials.\n\nVance’s trip also comes as the Trump administration is considering the use of the Alien Enemy Act of 1798 to detain and deport Venezuelans based on a proclamation labeling the gang Tren de Aragua an invasion force that could be acting at the behest of that country’s government. That’s according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nIt is unclear how close the decisions are to being finalized. Some officials have questioned whether the gang is acting as a tool for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom the U.S. has not recognized as that country’s legitimate leader. There are some concerns that invoking the law would require the U.S. to more formally recognize Maduro.\n\nStill, the 1798 law allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country with which the U.S. is at war, and it has been mentioned by Trump as a possible tool to speed up his mass deportations.\n\n(Copyright (c) 2024 The Associated Press.

Little did he know that his opponents would simply just drop their guard. The Left's pushback was more confused than a Kamala Harris word salad.\n\nFirst, crusty impeachment enthusiast, Texas Rep. Al Green, stood and shouted and waved his gold-handled cane at the president. When he ignored Speaker Mike Johnson's warning to pipe down, he was booted out.\n\n'Who the heck is producing this thing?' I thought. 'WWE co-founder-turned-Education-Secretary Linda McMahon?'\n\nAnd folks, we were just getting warmed up.\n\nSome Dems wore yellow and blue in support of Ukraine. Others wore black, perhaps in mourning for their political careers.\n\nAmericans have grown addicted to political theater and President Donald Trump 's speech to Congress (pictured) scratched that itch... and then some.\n\nI hadn't been that entertained by a president since Joe Biden gnawed off a baby foot on Halloween (pictured). \n\nThe Democratic Women's Caucus cleverly cloaked themselves in pink as some sort of protest but ended up looking like discarded wads of bubblegum stuck to the seats from which they refused to budge. And while these electoral losers sat looking like they'd just been forced to drink curdled milk Trump called them out for it.\n\n'I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud,' he said. 'I could find a cure to the most devastating disease… or announce the answers to the greatest economy in history or the stoppage of crime… and these people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand and certainly will not cheer.'\n\nAt the very least, they could have perked up when Trump announced that DOGE daddy Elon Musk had discovered jaw-dropping numbers of Americans listed as alive by the Social Security Administration despite being more than 130 years old. Believe it or not, Trump said, that government databases even listed one recipients as older than the United States of America itself.\n\n'So, what?' grumbled Joe Biden from Delaware. 'He's a spring chicken.'\n\nAnd when Trump cited 130,000 Social Security recipients over 160 years-old the president had one of the lines of the night, turning to Health and Human Services Secretary RFK Jr. and joking, 'We have a healthier country than I thought, Bobby!'\n\nIt's funny because there's only one thing that the Left hates more than rooting out waste, fraud and abuse – a Kennedy who refuses to carry their water.\n\nMeanwhile, Hamas-adjacent Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib was very busy scribbling dimwitted phrases on whiteboard that she held up for the cameras to see.\n\nIt read 'Start paying your taxes' and 'Stopping lying to the American people.' I half expected her to write 'Any spare change?'\n\nThe most telling moment of the night came when Trump announced that Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelenskyy had sent him a box of chocolate and flowers to apologize for their bad date on Friday. Apparently, Zelenskyy is finally ready to make a commitment... to peace.\n\nCrusty impeachment enthusiast, Texas Rep. Al Green (pictured), stood and shouted and waved his gold-handled cane at the president.\n\nThe Democratic Women's Caucus cleverly cloaked themselves in pink as some sort of protest but ended up looking like discarded wads of bubblegum stuck to the seats that they refused to budge from. \n\nBut, for some utterly bizarre reason, progressive, race-faker Senator Elizabeth Warren began to applaud like harbor seal on speed when Trumlamented that billions in taxpayer money that Biden sent to Ukraine.\n\n'Do you want to keep [the Ukraine-Russia war] going for another 5 years?' Trump asked Loony Liz. 'Pocahontas says 'Yes!'\n\nIndeed, Warren's political principles seem as sincere as her genealogy.\n\nWeren't the Democrats once the party of peaceniks? I supposed they were also once the party of workingman.\n\nBoy, do times change.\n\nBut my laughter turned to anger – the best drug of all – when these silly Dems with paddles bearing slogans like 'Save Medicaid' and 'Musk Steals,' sat on their hands brazenly snubbing the families of murder victims slaughtered by illegal immigrant criminals.\n\nIt was painful to watch as the mother and sister of murdered 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley stood for the kind of recognition no family ever asks for.\n\nLaken was killed by illegal immigrant Jose Ibarra while she out on a morning jog near her Georgia college campus in February 2024. Ibarra had been arrested and released by multiple federal and state agencies in the months before committing his senseless crime. He was an associate of the Venezuelan prison gang, Tren de Aragua, that is now terrorizing US cities. Thanks, Joe.\n\nTwelve-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray was also killed by Tren gangbangers. Her mother was in the audience on Tuesday as Trump – ever the showman – re-named a 34,000-acre wildlife preserve in Jocelyn's honor.\n\nTeary eyed Republicans rose in applause.\n\nIt was painful to watch as the mother and sister of murdered 22-year-old nursing student Laken Riley (pictured) stood for the kind of recognition no family ever asks for.\n\nBut from the heartless Democrat-side of the aisle there was nothing but frowny faces and crickets.\n\nFor the truth is that aside from their childish antics, they have nothing left.\n\nThe once powerful matriarch of the House Nancy Pelosi simply glared at Trump chewing on her dental work, like someone who should've already been put to bed after her serving of Jello.\n\nStripped by the voters of a majority in the House, there would be no remarks for the former Speaker to dramatically rip to shreds. Neutered by audiences, who left in search of something more reliable, the Left's slavish media enablers are now just shrieking into the void.\n\nThis is the new normal in America. The Orange Man in the driver's seat boldly proclaimed to his seething haters, 'Every day we will stand up, and we will fight, fight, fight, for the country our citizens believe in and for the country our people deserve.'\n\n'Get ready for an incredible future,' the President said, 'because the golden age of America has just begun. It will be like nothing that has ever been seen before.'\n\nIf it's anything like last night's joint address, it'll be a hell of a ride.\n\nJoe BidenDonald TrumpUkraine\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nIs 'Pocahontas' Warren on the warpath?

Garanci për këtë, sipas tij, është logjika check & balance, mbi bazën e së cilës është ndërtuar ai sistem, mbi të gjitha tri pushtetet (ekzekutiv, legjislativ e gjyqësor) e fuqizuara aq sa duhet me synimin për të mbajtur nën kontroll njëri-tjetrin, e më gjerë një rrjet institucionesh e agjencish që funksionojnë mbi bazën e ligjit e që nuk lejojnë asnjë njeri të fuqishëm, sidozot presidentin, të shndërrohet në një monark absolut. Me përpjekjet për të vrarë që në vezë idenë e ngritjes së një monarkie absolute, udhëheqësit e revolucionit amerikan treguan se ishin lajmëtarë të kohëve që nuk vonuan të vinin. Kur James Madison and Co. u mblodhën në Filadelfia për të hartuar e miratuar Kushtetutën, mbretërit absolutë ishin ende në modë. Revolucioni francez, që me ekzekutimin në karamanjollë të Luigjit XVI do të shënjonte fillimin e fundit të atij sistemi qeverisës, ende nuk kishte nisur.\n\nTanimë është e qartë për të gjithë se Friedman-i nuk ka qullosur gjë me këtë pohim, që atë mot jo vetëm ishte i kollajtë për t’u bërë, por edhe s’kishte të sharë. Më shumë se 200 vjet të historisë së SHBA-ve dukej se nuk kishin bërë gjë tjetër, veçse kishin provuar saktësinë e asaj që thoshte ai. Tek-tuk ishte shfaqur në këtë histori ndonjë rob i prapë, i cili me të hyrë si qiraxhi në Shtëpinë e Bardhë, zbulonte se nuk i mjaftonte fuqia kushtetuese për të bërë “punë të mëdha në të mirë të amerikanëve”, apo se rregullat e këqija i bëheshin pengesë vullnetit të tij të mirë, por ledhet e ngritura kushtetuese kishin rezistuar dhe i kishin bërë zap tekat e manitë e tyre. Dhe kështu, Friedman-i pati të drejtë derisa u mor vesh që e kishte gabim, apo thënë ndryshe, derisa në skenë u shfaq Donald J. Trump, një personazh me disponimin e fuqinë individuale për të shembur gjithçka e për të na dhënë neve leksionin e rëndësishëm: Një kushtetutë, sado e arrirë dhe e mirëmenduar të jetë, nuk mjafton. Sepse mbarëvajtja e demokracisë amerikane, ashtu si e demokracisë në përgjithësi, më shumë sesa mbi përcaktimet e qarta e të përpikta kushtetuese, bazohet në përgjithësi tek ethosi e morali publik e në veçanti te një ujdi e panënshkruar (por e mbështetur në heshtje) mbi respektimin e rregullave bazike të lojës, Nëse njëra palë politike, apo të dyja, vendosin të mos e njohin këtë ujdi, atëherë gara politike mund të shndërrohet sakaq në një konflikt të frikshëm.\n\nFjala vjen, kalimin paqësor të pushtetit ne e kishim marrë si një të dhënë të dhënë (ndjesë për lojën e fjalëve) njëherë e mirë, por në fakt nuk paskësh qenë kështu. Thjesht nuk kishte dalë dikush që, pas humbjes, të thoshte: Unë dhe votuesit e mi nuk e njohim humbjen. Dhe neve na u desh për herë të parë të mendonim se kalimi paqësor i pushtetit prej humbësit te fituesi ishte bërë i mundur, jo në sajë të ndonjë përcaktimi kushtetues, por në sajë të skrupujve të udhëheqësve politikë e të shpirtit civik e inteligjencës morale të votuesve, që nuk ishin parë ndonjëherë t’i shkonin pas udhëheqësit të tyre që nuk njihte humbjen.\n\nMe Donald Trump-in punët janë ndryshe. Ai nuk i ka skrupujt e paraardhësve të vet, ndërsa shumë mbështetës të tij kanë si gjënë më të shenjtë admirimin për të. Ata mendojnë se Trump-i vetë vlen më tepër sesa partia e më tepër sesa republika vetë. Shumë syresh e shohin presidentin e tyre si dhuratë që Zoti ia ka bërë Amerikës, dhe kjo ndjesi u është përforcuar pasi ai i shpëtoi për një qime atentatit të korrikut 2024. Plumbi i ceku veshin, teksa po fliste në tribunë, me fytyrën e kthyer djathtas, andej nga i erdhi plumbi. Me kokën në çdo pozicion tjetër, Trump-i do të ishte sot i vdekur, dhe është ky fakt që i bën të vetët të besojnë se ishte një vullnet qiellor që e donte atë të mbeste i gjallë për të përmbushur një mision: të shpëtonte Shtetet e Bashkuara të Amerikës. E meqë jemi këtu, inatin le t’ia kemi, por hakun të mos ia hamë: Reagimi i tij në të nxehtë, vetëm disa sekonda pasi plumbi i fshiku veshin, nuk mund të linte indiferent askënd, e jo më të vetët, të cilët u legjitimuan disi në sytë e publikut në dashurinë që ata e kishin shprehur e manifestuar me kohë për udhëheqësin e tyre.\n\nMund të thuhet pa frikë se Trump-i është një udhëheqës i rrethuar me dashuri (në të gjallë të vet) si asnjë tjetër në historinë e Amerikës. Do duhej t’i mjaftonte kjo dashuri, por ai jep shenja se do kishte dashur që ta donin e mbështesnin të gjithë amerikanët (gjysma e urrejnë, në fakt), do donte të ishte si diktatori koreano-verior, të cilit nuk i vihet në diskutim autoriteti e të cilin nuk del askush ta sfidojë në publik. E ka kot këtë xhelozi (nëse vërtet e ka). Në rastin e Kim Jong Un-it gjithçka është e ngritur mbi frikën. Ndërsa Trump-in e duan me gjithë zemër, i falin besim e mbështetje të sinqertë, i shkojnë nga pas pa pritur gjë në këmbim, i njohin të drejtën për të gabuar sa herë të dojë, dhe tregojnë se janë të gatshëm të mbyllnin një sy, shpeshherë të dy, përballë huqeve, veseve e paudhësive të tij.\n\nAsnjë efekt nuk do të kishte te mbështetësit e Trump-it, nëse ky i fundit “do dilte me kobure në avenjunë e pestë e do të shtinte mbi kalimtarët”, apo nëse një gjykatë do ta shpallte fajtor për një krim federal, siç edhe e shpalli. Dhe kjo ndodh ngaqë Trump-i i përfaqëson ata si askush tjetër në shqetësimet e tyre, sidomos ato lidhur me emigrantët që u rrëmbejnë atyre vendet e punës, ndërlikojnë bashkëjetesën në diversitet, komprometojnë sigurinë e jetës urbane, bartin e imponojnë vlera që bien ndesh me qytetërimin perëndimor, e me dukuritë apo lëvizjet e njohura tanimë: wokeism, cancel culture, culture war, identity politics, etj, etj.\n\nNdërsa demokratët nuk dhanë pothuajse asnjë shenjë se i mirëkuptonin këto shqetësime, Trump-i i bëri të vetat që të gjitha, duke themeluar e farkëtuar kështu një nga aleancat më të forta në histori mes një udhëheqësi politik e votuesve të tij, që e shpëtoi atë pas sulmit që iu bë Capitol-it. Ajo që ndodhi më 6 janar 2021 mund t’i ketë tronditur shumicën e mbështetësve të Trump-it, por ata e morën si një gjë jo fort të rëndësishme përballë kauzës së madhe. (Trump-i ndërseu njerëzit drejt ndërtesës së Kongresit? Kujt i bëhet vonë, thanë ca e ca. Mirë bëri, thanë ca të tjerë.) Trump-i ishte shpresa e tyre e vetme dhe e fundit në mbrojtje të çfarë ata e kanë më të shtrenjtë: familjes, atdheut, moralit, kufijve, qytetërimit, dhe nuk mund t’i jepnin duart për “pak gjë”,\n\nMirëpo, ajo që ndodhi më 6 janar 2021, tok me çfarë i parapriu asaj date (një aksion i tërë për të delegjitimuar zgjedhjet), u kalli frikën në zemër pjesës tjetër të amerikanëve dhe miliona njerëzve anembanë botës, Iu vu pikëpyetje, asëll-asëll iu vunë minat (punë tjetër që minat nuk plasën), gjësë më të bukur që ka prodhuar ndonjëherë njerëzimi në fushën e qeverisjes: kalimit paqësor të pushtetit nga duart e një grupi njerëzish në duart e një grupi tjetër njerëzish. Dhe sikur të mos ishte për zëvendësin e Trumpit, sistemi do të kishte rënë, e një djall e di se ç’do të kishte ndodhur. Pakkush besonte atë mot se Mike Pence do kishte zemër për të bërë atë që bëri. Republikanët e tjerë në Kongres, me fare pak përjashtime, ishin zbythur një e nga një. Ishte krijuar një klimë e konformimit me njeriun më të fortë të momentit që kishte në dorë fatin politik të secilit prej tyre, dhe situata ishte e pashpresë. Edhe armiqtë më të egër të Trump-it (Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz, J. D. Vance etj.) ishin konvertuar në trumpistë të thekur. Në anën tjetër, me miliona votues republikanë po tregonin se nuk e vinin hiç në dyshim pretendimin e Trump-it që zgjedhjet ishin manipuluar. Trump-i kishte nisur të fliste në publik kundër burracakut Mike Pence, që kishte shfaqur ca dyshime lidhur me rolin që po i kërkohej të luante.\n\nZëvendëspresidenti nuk është se mendonte që zgjedhjet ishin të rregullta (të paktën, asnjëherë nuk e tha këtë), por nuk ishte 100% i bindur se kishte në dorë të zhbënte atë që kishin njohur gjykatat njëra pas tjetrës. Në këto kushte, të besoje tek ai, që përveç të tjerash kishte demonstruar një besnikëri 360-gradëshe ndaj Trump-it gjatë katër viteve të përbashkëta në Shtëpinë e Bardhë, ishte si të ngopeshe me lugë të zbrazët. “Sistemi po bie,” mendonin shumë vetë. Por ai burrë në dukje qullac bëri të pabesueshmen në rolin e drejtuesit të sesionit të përbashkët të Kongresit ku do pranohej e njihej kolegji elektoral i sapo zgjedhur. Ai vendosi t’i thoshte “jo” Trump-it. Mbrojti sistemin. I vetëm. Dhe kjo nuk flet për forcën e sistemit. Përkundrazi, flet për brishtësinë e tij. Nuk mund të jetë ndryshe kur sistemi mbrohet prej një aksidenti fatlum. Në vend të Mike Pence-it mund të ishte Rudy Giuliani, dhe amerikanëve në këtë rast hipotetik do t’u thuhej: “Demokracia na la shëndenë. Të rroni vetë. Për të mira kështu e tutje.”\n\nPor ideja se më të keqen e kemi rrugës gjallon mes nesh, megjithatë. Dhe jo pa arsye. Në fakt, sikur Trump-i të ketë mendje të ligë, sistemi nuk do të jetë në gjendje ta mbajë mbi shpinë edhe katër vjet të tjera në Shtëpinë e Bardhë, dhe kështu nuk vlen ngushëllimi se katër viteve të ardhshme, ndonëse do të jenë pazakonshmërisht të gjatë, do t’u vijë fundi shpejt, dhe Trump-i do ta lërë Shtëpinë e Bardhë për t’u kthyer një herë e mirë në Mar-a-Lago. Katër vjet janë shumë në rrethanat kur Trump-i ka marrë një mandat shumë të fortë, kur ka me vete Kongresin, dhe me shumë gjasë do ta ketë edhe pas zgjedhjeve në mes të këtij mandati presidencial. Disa arritje të pritshme të tijat të lidhura me emigracionin ilegal, me paqen në Ukrainë e në Lindjen e Mesme, me ekonominë, me atë që quhet culture war, etj, mund t’ia lehtësojnë punën në këto zgjedhje, duke ia rritur avantazhin në Kongres.\n\nMë tej, Trump do udhëheqë në një si klimë kapitullimi që ka pllakosur në shoqërinë amerikane, të paktën në këtë moment të parë, për shkak të rikthimit të tij, që është më i bujshmi në historinë e botës moderne, Ai i ka mposhtur të gjithë. Antitrumpistët e botës së muzikës, filmit, sportit, etj, kanë marrë një shuplakë të paimagjinueshme, dhe kjo do t’i bëjë ta mbajnë gojën mbyllur një copë herë të mirë. Ca të tjerë nuk u menduan dy herë për të kërcyer në vagonin e fitimtarëve, ose në rastin më të mirë, për t’i dhënë një të kthyer timonit. Joe Scarborough e Mika Brzhezhinski, dy nga gazetarët më kritikë të Trump-it, kërkuan t’i bëjnë këtij të fundit një vizitë në shtëpinë e tij në Palm Beach të Floridës menjëherë pas zgjedhjeve. Dhe Trump-i “zemërgjerë” ua hapi derën me të dyja kanatat. Më herët i kishin puthur unazën Mark Zuckerberg e Jeff Bezos, miliarderë me formim liberal që nuk e kishin fshehur asnjëherë anti-trumpizmin e tyre. Shumë kritikë të tjerë të Trump-it janë zhdukur nga qarkullimi. Ish-presidentët Bush e Clinton duket se nuk e kanë në plan të krruajnë brirët me pasardhësin e tyre. Barack Obama po flet, por me gjysmë zëri. Intelektualët publikë janë kapur pas temave të tjera dhe e po e lënë Trump-in të qetë, nga frika se mos akuzohen si të kapur prej sindromës “Trump Derangement”. Komedianët që drejtojnë programet “Late Night Show” nuk kanë më zellin e parë anti Trump. Duket se jetojnë me idenë se kanë thënë gjithçka lidhur me këtë temë. Nuk e kanë keq.\n\nGjykatat hë për hë nuk po tregojnë se janë të ndikuara prej klimës përreth, por edhe ato do të bien pak e nga pak në duart e trumpistëve, gjë që do të ndodhë pa ndonjë zor të madh së pari për shkak të klimës së kapitullimit, e së dyti ngaqë është vetë sistemi juridik i politizuar që e lehtëson këtë gjë. Anëtarët e gjykatave federale, në të trija nivelet, emërohen nga Presidenti dhe konfirmohen nga Senati, e rrinë në detyrë për sa kohë do të marrin frymë mbi faqe të dhéut. Dhe kështu, Presidentët që rrinë tetë vjet në Shtëpinë e Bardhë, sidomos kur kanë Senatin nën kontroll, kanë në dorë të lënë gjurmë të forta në sistemin juridik federal. Fjala vjen, me t’u siguruar një epërsi në Gjykatën e Lartë, ajo është vështirësisht e zhbëshme. Republikanët hë për hë e kanë këtë epërsi, madje të thellë. Në këtë gjykatë janë gjashtë gjyqtarë të emëruar prej tyre, dhe vetëm tre të emëruar nga demokratët, gjë që u duk qartë tek vendimi, me anën e të cilit iu dha imunitet Trump-it si ish-President (me këtë rast edhe çdo ish-presidenti) për çdo krim të mundshëm të kryer gjatë ushtrimit të detyrës së Presidentit. Votat mbi këtë çështje u ndanë si me thikë: 6:3.\n\nMund të mbahej shpresë tek ata që e kanë për detyrë t’i qëndrojnë përballë Presidentit, tek demokratët pra, por këta nuk e kanë marrë ende veten prej goditjes, të cilën është pak të thuash që e patën hak. Është e pashpjegueshme ajo që ndodhi me ta. Biden-i ishte thjesht një zombie në më shumë se gjysmën e mandatit të vet, rrëzohej nga biçikleta, rrëzohej shkallëve të avionit presidencial, nuk e mbanin këmbët para mikrofonit, e merrte gjumi kudo që shkonte, humbiste mendjen teksa ishte mes udhëheqësve të tjerë të botës, dhe për çudi nuk u pa as bashkëshortja e tij, as ndonjë eksponent i partisë demokratike, as ndonjë miliarder donator, as ndonjë ish-president apo bashkëpunëtor i tij në Shtëpinë e Bardhë të shprehte shqetësimin për gjendjen e tij e për situatën e vendit. Përkundrazi, të gjithë betoheshin për mbështetje e besnikëri ndaj kandidaturës së tij.\n\nEdhe debati me Trump-in që e nxori fare zbuluar (bota pa për herë të parë një kandidat presidencial amerikan që mezi mbërriti deri te foltorja e që nuk lidhte dot fjalët) nuk mjaftoi që t’i nxirrte nga kllapia ku ishin zhytur. Një parti e tërë nuk gjente mënyrën për t’u marrë me një kufomë që ecte. U desh një aktor, George Clooney, të shkruante një artikull, në të cilin i kërkoi Biden-it të bënte një hap pas, dhe vetëm pas kësaj çështja u shtrua për diskutim. Bosët e partisë u bënë më në fund të gjallë, veçse jo për të ngritur zërin publikisht kundër një situate të papranueshme, por për ta rrëzuar kandidaturën e Biden-it nëpërmjet kurthesh e komplotesh nëpër kthina e korridore pallatesh të politikës, E lanë sidoqoftë atë t’i bënte edhe dëmin e fundit partisë e vendit, të caktonte pasardhësin e vet. Dhe ai nuk zhgënjeu. Caktoi një si veten: Kamala Harris-in. Pas kësaj, të tjerët filluan garën kush e kush ta mbështeste më shumë kanakaren e tij. Ka diçka që s’shkon me këtë parti.\n\nPartia republikane nuk është në një gjendje më të mirë, sidoqoftë, por për arsye të ndryshme. Në këtë moment, ajo është e gjallëruar prej fitores, dhe prej betejave e kauzave konservatore që kanë ngjitur në publik, por i është bërë rrogoz Donald Trump-it. Në partinë republikane nuk ka më hapësirë për mendime që nuk pëlqehen prej udhëheqësit. Kush nuk e kupton këtë, e sheh veten jashtë radhëve, për rrjedhojë nuk zgjidhet apo rizgjidhet në Kongres apo në çdo post tjetër në nivel shteti apo federate. Nuk numërohen ata që s’e kanë patur për gjë të bëjnë një kthesë 180-gradëshe në marrëdhëniet me Presidentin e tyre. Në momentin që Trump-i u shfaq në skenë si kandidat presidencial, J. D. Vance e quajti idiot e të neveritshëm. Madje, ka dëshmi, që thonë se e ka quajtur Hitler. Sot është krahu i djathtë i Trump-it, Zëvendëspresidenti i Shteteve të Bashkuara të Amerikës.\n\nMarco Rubio e ka quajtur atë “kokrra e mashtruesit” (con artist), dhe sot është sekretari i shtetit në administratën e Trump-it. Ted Cruz nuk vonoi të kthehej nga kritik i fortë në një mbështetës i tij i pakompromis. Senatori Lindsey Graham u shpreh të nesërmen e 6 janarit 2021 se frymëzuesi i protestuesve duhet të japë llogari për atë që ndodhi, por katër vjet më vonë, kur Trump-i fali me qindra të dënuar lidhur me atë ngjarje, reagimi i Graham-it ishte i thatë: Mua nuk më pëlqen kjo gjë. Sot jemi në situatën, kur Trump e shpura e tij mund të bëjnë e thonë ç’të duan, duke qenë të sigurt se askush nuk do ngrihet t’u thotë: Hej, stop, po kaloni vijën e kuqe. Dhe ndodh rëndom në rrethana të tilla të unitetit rreth shefit, që mbështetësit të bëhen më katolikë sesa Papa. Disa janë duke e çuar më tej frymën konservatore të Trump-it.\n\nZëvendëspresidenti i sotëm shkoi deri në Mynih ku, me pretekstin e mbrojtjes së demokracisë e të fjalës së lirë (republikanët amerikanë në mbrojtje të demokracisë e të fjalës së lirë!!!), nuk e pati për gjë t’u bëhej krah partive ekstreme të kontinentit të vjetër. Përpara tij, të njëjtën gjë kishte bërë miliarderi Elon Musk, dhe ishte kjo mbështetje që bëri shumë vetë t’ia merrnin për sjellje naziste çalltisjen për të shtrirë krahun e djathtë 45 gradë përpara-lart, teksa po i fliste një turme. Me shumë gjasë, veprimi i tij ishte një trill lojcak i dorës së djathtë në momente përndezjeje skenike, por nuk mund të thuhet e njëjta gjë për Steve Bannon-in, një prej fajkonjve të konservatorizmit amerikan, që më 21 shkurt përsëriti të njëjtin gjest, të cilin krahu i shkurtër e trupi i dhjamur ia zhveshi prej ndonjë ambiguiteti. Me t’u ballafaquar me reagimet e shumta (delegati i partisë së Le Pen-it që u ndodh në të njëjtin event hoqi dorë nga ideja për të mbajtur një fjalë), Bannoni u ngut të sqaronte. “Është mënyra se si unë përshëndes kur jam përpara turmës,” tha ai. Janë të shumtë, sidoqoftë, ata që besojnë se ai u tregua burracak duke mos i dalë për zot asaj që bëri. Por përtej këtij gjesti, konservatorët amerikanë duket se po shtyhen shumë në të djathtë.\n\nPo jetojmë një nazizëm 2.0 në fillesat e veta? Në Europë, as që bëhet fjalë hë për hë. Ka me siguri AfD-istë, që janë nazistë, por vetë partia nuk është naziste, gjë që është bërë e qartë në program e në qëndrime. Është nacionaliste, euroskeptike, e prirur për t’u afruar e bashkëpunuar me Putinin, dhe kundër emigracionit, por asgjë më shumë sesa kaq. Sa për partitë e tjera, Frontin Nacional në Francë, Vëllezërit e Italisë, Partinë e Lirisë në Holandë e Austri, Fidesz-in në Hungari etj, frika duket e tepërt. Por edhe në Amerikë, më shumë vihet re një lloj dëshire konservatorësh për revansh teksa bota gjendet e tejmbytur prej vlerave liberale (po i përdor termat “konservator” e “liberal” në kuptimin amerikan) sesa ndonjë projekt autoritarist apo totalitar. Hë për hë.\n\nPor Trump-i mbetet gjithsesi një rrezik, që nuk duhet nënvlerësuar. Ai është mujshar, narciz, ndysëkeq, idhnak. Ndonjëherë shfaqet si një fëmijë llastuar e i parritur. Më shumë se tetë vjet më parë, pas një debati televiziv mes republikanësh, në të cilin Trump-i s’e pati për gjë të merrej edhe me gruan e Ted Cruz-it, gazetari Anderson Cooper i vuri në dukje se kjo ishte e ulët e dashaligë. Përgjigja e tij ishte: Vetë e kruajti i pari. Vini re: E përmendi faktin që “Tedi e kruajti vetë i pari” si një justifikim që del e tepron, e jo si një rrethanë aksidentale që e shtyu atë në një lajthim. E do ishte mendjelehtë të mendohej se ky është një episod, të cilit nuk i duhet dhënë rëndësi. Jo, nuk është episod. Është një sjellje që ai e manifeston në çdo situatë, sado serioze të jetë. Ja, shihni shpërthimin e tij kundër Zelensky-t, të cilin krejt papritur e quajti komedian 20-qindarkësh, diktator, shkakun e vërtetë të luftës, të pavlerë etj, dhe e gozhdoi me kërkesën për t’i falur SHBA-ve të drejtën për të shfrytëzuar mineralet e rralla të Ukrainës, E gjitha kjo ndodhi, ngaqë Zelensky “e kruajti vetë i pari”, teksa u ngut të thoshte se “Trump-i ka rënë viktimë e informacioneve të rreme ruse”.\n\nSë dyti, është mania e tij për pushtet, të cilën e ka treguar tanimë në rrethana nga më të ndryshmet (sidomos duke mos njohur humbjen në zgjedhje), por e ka shprehur edhe me admirimin ndaj despotëve të botës. Trump-i (si President i SHBA-ve) e ka fuqinë më të madhe se të tyren, por puna është që ata nuk e lënë figurën e autoritetin e tyre të dobësohet apo vihet në diskutim në “farsa” zgjedhjesh (Xi Jinping, Kim Jong Un), në mos fitoren në zgjedhje e kanë si bukë me djathë (Putin-i). Trump-i, jo vetëm i ka zili, por edhe i çmon. Putin-in e ka quajtur gjenial vetëm pak ditë pasi forcat ruse u futën në Ukrainë. Për Presidentin kinez ka thënë se “nuk mund të gjendet një tjetër më i mençur se ai”. Kim Jong Un-i i ka fituar zemrën me aftësinë e tij për të sunduar vendin e vet që kur ishte në të njëzetat e veta.\n\nSikur Enver Hoxha të ishte gjallë sot, e sikur regjimi i tij të ishte për një arsye a një tjetër një gajle për amerikanët, ai me siguri do t’i kishte fituar zemrën Trump-it me aftësinë për të sunduar brutalisht popullin e vet. Dhe do ta kishte marrë në mbrojtje, siç bën me diktatorët e sotëm. Vëzhgimit të Bill O’Reilly-t se Putin-i është vrasës, se ai zhduk kundërshtarët e tij politikë, Trump-i iu përgjigj: Pse, ne amerikanët jemi të pafajshëm? Politika e jashtme e SHBA-ve dhe e vendeve të tjera perëndimore ka qenë e ngritur deri më sot mbi bindjen se demokracia liberale (e drejta e popujve për të zgjedhur drejtuesit e vet, rule of law, të drejtat e njeriut, liria e shprehjes etj.) duhet mbrojtur e promovuar, dhe kjo duhet bërë jo vetëm për të mirën e perëndimit, por të së gjithë botës. Ndërsa Trump-i nuk duket se ka gjë kundër regjimeve despotike e totalitare. Madje, as që jeton me idenë se Amerika ka për detyrë të eksportojë modelin e vet politik. Demokracia liberale nuk është për të “fundi i historisë”. Është thjesht një sistem qeverisës.\n\nSë treti, është dëshira e tij për t’i vënë kazmën rendit botëror e për të shpikur një rend të ri darvinian, që në fakt s’është fare e ri, përkundrazi, është rendi i moçëm e parak i gjërave, ku ligjin e bën fuqia, e jo arsyeja. Atij i duket e pabesueshme, dhe e padrejtë, të mos përdorë fuqinë që e ka, apo t’u marrë dorën të tjerëve para se ta përdorë. OKB-në e organizma të tjerë që kanë patur për detyrë për dekada të tëra të qeverisin fatet e botës i sheh si gjyle të lidhura në këmbët e veta. Dhe kështu, ai po përuron një erë të re. Nuk kuptohet deri në fund kjo lëvizje e tij, ç’është e vërteta. Ndoshta po i hap rrugën një gjëje që rrugën e ka të hapur: botës shumëpolare. Me fjalë të tjera, ai po e kupton se koha për SHBA-të si superfuqi e vetme po mbaron, dhe se duhet menduar për kohën që po vjen, e cila u përket edhe fuqive të tjera, si Kina, India, Rusia etj., me të cilat mund të kërkojë përplasjen me synimin për t’i mposhtur (gjë me qeder për të gjithë), ose t’i ftojë të bëhen bashkë me synimin për të ndarë zonat e influencës e për të marrë vendime mbi fatin e të tjerëve. Ai ka ndërmarrë disa veprime, me anën e të cilave nxit apo i legjitimon fuqitë e tjera në qasjen mujshare të tyre. Kur i jep të drejtë vetes për të marrë Groenlandën (thjesht se i duhet), si do ta pengojë Kinën të marrë Taivanin? Shkurt, mjerë vendet e vogla, që do të jenë në mëshirë të fatit! Sepse të fuqishmit do t’u thonë: “Doni mbrojtjen time? Paguani. Nuk doni të paguani? Në qafë paçi veten.”\n\nSë fundi, është frika se ai mund të mos e lërë Shtëpinë e Bardhë, gjë që ushqehet nga vetë Trump-i. Më datën 21 shkurt, në një veprimtari në kuadër të muajit që i dedikohet historisë së njerëzve me ngjyrë në SHBA, ai foli fare pa të keq për mundësinë e zgjedhjes për herë të tretë si President. Rri, rri, e i kthehet kësaj teme. Dhe republikanët ngjajnë se nuk kanë ndonjë gjë kundër kësaj dëshire të Trump-it. Ata që ishin në sallë i mbajtën iso aty për aty. Iu drejtuan Trump-it në kor: “Edhe katër vjet për ty.” Steve Bannon-i ka gjetur një arsye “speciale” për ta mbështetur këtë ide. “Një njeri si Trump-i shfaqet një herë, maksimumi dy, në historinë e një kombi,” tha ai. Me fjalë të tjera, nuk shkon që këtij personazhi unik në histori t’i bëhet pengesë kushtetuta!!!\n\nTrump-i vetë i lëshon në formë shakaje hamendjet se mund të rrijë në Shtëpinë e Bardhë edhe një mandat të tretë. Por kujdes! Shaka u duk se bëri edhe kur tha se nuk do t’i njihte zgjedhjet në rast humbjeje, por në fund doli që rrallë kishte qenë më serioz sesa aq. Donald Trump nuk e pranon as sot e kësaj dite se ishte humbës në zgjedhjet e vitit 2020. Sa herë që e pyesin apo sa herë që përroi i ndërgjegjes e çon në atë temë, ai nuk harron të përsëritë se atij ia vodhën fitoren. Të njëjtën gjë e përsëriti edhe para zgjedhjeve të vitit 2024. “Nëse humb, atëherë zgjedhjet janë të vjedhura,” ia bëri. Dhe fitorja e tij këtë herë ishte “providenciale”, pasi në këtë mënyrë amerikanët iu kthyen sërish transferimit paqësor të pushtetit, dhe ceremonisë së bukur bipartizane. Nëse Trump-i nuk do të fitonte, nuk dihet se ç’do kishte ndodhur. Sistemi me siguri do kishte marrë një të krisur të madhe. Nëse nuk do kishte shpërthyer një luftë civile.\n\nKa gjasa praktike që Trump-i të qëndrojë në Shtëpinë e Bardhë deri në vitin 2032? Si rregull, jo. Në amendamentin e 22-të, që u miratua në përfundim të karrierës kilometrike të Franklin D. Roosevelt-it (qëndroi katër mandate në detyrë), thuhet: “Askush nuk mund të zgjidhet President më shumë se dy herë; edhe ai që ka qenë në detyrën e Presidentit për më shumë se dy vjet, duke vijuar mandatin e fituar nga dikush tjetër, nuk ka të drejtë të zgjidhet për më shumë se një mandt…”. Që Trump-i të rrijë edhe një mandat të tretë, apo të katërt, lipset një interpretim kokëposhtë i këtij amendamenti. Trump-i e të vetët nuk do ta kenë për turp ndoshta ta bëjnë këtë interpretim, dhe çështja kështu do të shkojë në gjykatat federale. Fjalën e fundit do ta thotë Gjykata e Lartë, dhe në këtë rast është e zorshme të besosh që rezultati i votimit do të jetë ai i zakonshmi, domethënë 6:3. Anëtarët e kësaj gjykate, sado të anshëm apo tuhafë të jenë, do ta ruajnë një gram integriteti profesional, aq sa duhet, në fakt, për t’ua prishur qejfin trumpistëve. Ky version bie.\n\nMbetet të ndërmerret një aksion politik për shfuqizimin e amendamentit të 22-të, gjë që është një proces shumë i koklavitur. Duhen votat e 2/3 të Senatit e Dhomës së Përfaqësuesve, që është e vështirë t’i kesh apo t’i bësh. E nuk mbaron këtu. Për ratifikimin e plotë të nismës do duhet ok-i i 3/4 të parlamenteve të shteteve të veçanta. Edhe ky version bie. Mbetet një i tretë. Duke qenë se amendamenti i 22-të nuk lejon zgjedhjen për herë të tretë në postin e presidentit, juristët në oborrin e Trump-it kanë menduar një marifet. Kanë menduar ta cytin atë të pranojë pas vitit 2028 të bëhet zëvendëspresident, dhe në një moment më vonë, presidenti të japë dorëheqjen, dhe posti t’i kalojë Trump-it, pa qenë nevoja të zgjidhet. Ka dy pengesa, megjithatë. Një: U duhet të gjejnë dikë që të pranojë të zgjidhet president vetëm me kushtin që të japë dorëheqjen kur këtë t’ia kërkojë Trump-i. Hëm, është shumë ruso-kineze për t’u gëlltitur nga amerikanët. Nuk besoj se mund ta gjejnë një palaço të tillë që, lëri të tjerat, i duhet të fitojë edhe zgjedhjet. Por është pengesë edhe amendamenti i 12-të, që thotë se “nëse ka arsye që dikush të mos zgjidhet president, ai dikush nuk mund të zgjidhet as zëvendëspresident. Një version i katërt nuk ekziston, nëse nuk llogaritim që Trump-i të vendosë të mos dalë nga Shtëpia e Bardhë, me shpresën se nuk do ketë kush ta largojë prej andej (Trump-i ka filluar të zbatojë një spoils-system në stil të gjerë, dhe nuk është çudi që pas katër vjetësh institucionet e sigurisë të jenë tërësisht të trumpizuara).

He was, he said, \"just getting started.\"\n\nHow did his speech go over? The New York Times talked with six voters -- many of whom voted for Trump reluctantly -- as part of a regular check-in over the first 100 days of Trump's term.\n\n'It was very nice to see a lot of empathy.'\n\nTali Jackont, 57, from Los Angeles\n\nWhat struck Tali Jackont, an educator, more than anything was Trump's showmanship. The president, she said, showed off his magnetism -- his ability, like it or not, to combine forcefulness with bristling digs. She also enjoyed his humor.\n\n\"Listen, he understands the media, he understands TV,\" she said. \"He tried to say things here and there to break the seriousness of the speech,\" she added, noting that there were a few times when she found herself laughing out loud.\n\nThe entire speech, she added, \"was very impressive.\"\n\nAn immigrant from Israel and longtime Democrat, Jackont changed political course in November, voting for Trump, hoping that he could help Israel achieve peace, while reducing crime and getting her adopted country moving in a better direction. Although she would have liked the president to have spent more time on the Middle East, she said, his speech addressed the issues she cared about to her satisfaction.\n\nOne thing that surprised Jackont: the time Trump took to acknowledge Cabinet members and speak compassionately about guests in the audience, like Devarjaye Daniel, a 13-year-old known as D.J., who was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2018, and was invited to the speech.\n\n\"It showed a little bit of warmth of personality when he spoke about people,\" she said.\n\n\"It doesn't mean that he cannot behave the opposite and kick someone off like Zelenskyy,\" she added, referring to Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the Ukrainian president. \"But it was very nice to see a lot of empathy. It was very nice to see.\"\n\n-- Kurt Streeter\n\n'This was supposed to be a speech about how he was making America great again, but he was throwing out insults.'\n\nIsaiah Thompson, 22, from Washington\n\nIsaiah Thompson, a college student, was expecting a finely tuned performance from Trump in his speech to Congress. After all, he said, the president has had a long career in entertainment.\n\nWhat he was not expecting was the congressional response.\n\n\"On the Republican side, you had people standing, waving and chanting, 'USA,' and on the Democrat side, you had people sitting in silence and holding signs that said, 'Musk steals,'\" he said, referring to tech mogul Elon Musk. \"That one room showed how divided the country is. That divide worries me.\"\n\nThompson said he was fine with the president listing his accomplishments in the first six weeks of his second term, much of it an echo of the promises made in his inauguration speech in January. He acknowledged that the volume of Trump's actions is impressive, but remained troubled by the pace.\n\nThe address, he said, was intentionally provocative, with Trump taking unnecessary swipes at Democrats. \"This was supposed to be a speech about how he was making America great again, but he was throwing out insults,\" said Thompson, who supports the Green Party but ultimately voted for Kamala Harris.\n\nThompson was particularly bothered by Trump's use of tariffs as a bargaining tool and his description of certain programs -- involving Africa, immigration or LGBTQ+ communities -- as a flagrant waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\n\"It feels like those programs were targeted by DOGE, when there are plenty of other programs that could be cut,\" he said, referring to Musk's effort to cut back the federal government.\n\n-- Audra D.S. Burch\n\n'I'm ashamed of the Democratic Party.'\n\nDarlene Alfieri, 55, from Erie, Pennsylvania\n\n\"In my opinion, as a Democrat, that was a Republican Party win,\" said Darlene Alfieri, a longtime registered Democrat who had taken a chance on Trump in 2024.\n\nShe did not come to this conclusion primarily because of the president's speech. It might have been a bit more professional than some of his past speeches, she felt, but it was still light on the specifics she craved.\n\n\"He's still talking that we're going to be great, that things are going to get better, but I'm not seeing them get better in my day to day life,\" she said. \"Talk is cheap.\"\n\nShe said she believed it was a good night for Trump primarily because she thought it was a terrible night for the Democrats, some of whom heckled the president at the beginning and then mostly refused to stand and clap throughout, even for Devarjaye Daniel, a boy with cancer who the president recognized in the crowd.\n\n\"I'm ashamed of the Democratic Party,\" she said. \"Deliberately being argumentative and refusing to acknowledge good when it's good is ridiculous.\"\n\nAs for Trump himself, her opinion has remained the same since the election: supportive of his broader goals, frustrated that he is not more forthcoming about how he plans to achieve them. She welcomed the elimination of waste in the federal government, but wondered whether there were measures to make sure it did not come back. Reviving U.S. manufacturing is a great goal, she thought, but how much economic pain would it require?\n\nTrump's speech did not answer many of these questions.\n\n\"How is this going to happen?\" she asked. \"How long is it going to take? What are we going to have to endure in the meantime?\"\n\n-- Campbell Robertson\n\n'The way he said the American dream is alive, and coming back, that's a message of hope.'\n\nHamid Chaudhry, 53, from Reading, Pennsylvania\n\nHamid Chaudhry, a business owner, had cast a skeptical vote for Trump last year. He said he liked the president's business-minded approach but was concerned about his harsh rhetoric on immigrants. Chaudhry, now an American citizen, had come to the country from Pakistan.\n\nBut Trump's speech touched on many of the themes that drew him to this country in the first place. \"I came to America for the land of opportunity,\" Chaudhry said. \"The way he said the American dream is alive, and coming back, that's a message of hope.\"\n\nHe said he liked Trump's words of support for farmers, as he knows many in rural Berks County, and he appreciated the talk of bringing manufacturing back. He liked the idea of spending money on problems here rather than in foreign countries.\n\nChaudhry was not yet panicking about the impact of tariffs on the farmers and small business owners, believing that the tariffs were simply a tough negotiating move. As an example of what he saw as Trump's deal-making savvy, he pointed out that Zelenskyy had publicly committed to negotiating a peace deal after being berated at the White House a few days earlier.\n\nThe president \"called his bluff,\" Chaudhry said.\n\nThe strident talk about immigrants still bothered him, and he worried that constantly blaming them for so many problems might unleash hatred that could prove difficult to control. But he said Trump's actions -- surrounding himself with Kash Patel and Usha Vance, born to immigrant families, and Musk, born in South Africa -- suggested that his fiery talk was more rhetorical than substantive.\n\nAll in all, Chaudhry said, \"I'm feeling more comfortable\" about Trump. But, he added, \"I hope, at the speed they're moving, there's no major screwup.\"\n\n-- Campbell Robertson\n\n'He's constantly working angles.'\n\nPerry Hunter, 55, from Sellersburg, Indiana\n\nThe Democrats' behavior during the speech was a huge turnoff for Perry Hunter, a high school teacher who voted for Trump. He was disappointed, for example, that they mostly did not applaud -- even when Trump announced that \"a top terrorist\" had been captured for a bombing in Afghanistan that killed American military members, or when the boy with cancer was awarded a Secret Service badge.\n\n\"If they can't get past their partisanship for these things, it just reinforces that the Democrat Party is not for regular Americans,\" he said, adding that Trump knows exactly how to appeal to \"regular Americans.\"\n\nThe speech was Trump showmanship at its best, Hunter said, full of typical political bluster, which appears to be how Trump gets things done. Look how Zelenskyy was now agreeing to make concessions and participate in peace talks, he added, just several days after the tense and dramatic Oval Office meeting that led Trump to pause aid to Ukraine.\n\n\"Everyone thought it was the end of us helping them,\" Hunter said. \"But the way it was handled, correctly or not, Zelenskyy is now basically apologizing.\"\n\nHe called Trump \"a master negotiator,\" adding, \"He's constantly working angles.\"\n\n\"The thing that bothers me the most about him, though, is that he thrives in chaos,\" he said. \"It just seems like he wants that.\"\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nHunter isn't sure what to make of the tariffs just yet, but he said Trump has two years, until the midterm elections, to make them work for the American economy. While he personally would tolerate rising prices in the short term if that led to them dropping in the long term, he expects other Americans to \"want everything now, immediately.\"\n\n\"You have to have patience,\" he said, \"and I'm not sure how patient we are.\"\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\n-- Juliet Macur\n\n'Trump is accomplishing what many of the people who voted for him were hoping.'\n\nJaime Escobar Jr., 46, from Roma, Texas\n\nIt only took a few minutes, but for Jaime Escobar Jr., the mayor of a small town on the Texas border, the disruption of Trump's speech by Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, was another reminder of the nation's political divide.\n\n\"It is expected, yet a little sad,\" Escobar said, adding, \"When a president speaks, regardless of the political party, I think there should be a sort of decorum.\"\n\nEscobar paid particular attention to Trump's message on immigration. Roma, population 11,000, struggled with a migrant crisis under the Biden administration. Seeing his hometown overloaded by the daily arrivals led him, once a loyal Democrat, to vote for Trump. He was not alone. Starr County, home to Roma, also flipped for Trump.\n\n\"Illegal crossings have gone down significantly -- and it didn't take so much an act of Congress, but an executive order and a different type of leadership,\" Escobar said. \"Trump is accomplishing what many of the people who voted for him were hoping he would accomplish.\"\n\nBut not everything in Trump's speech left him brimming with optimism.\n\nIn fact, he went to bed worried about how the tariff wars between the U.S. and its trading partners would affect the local economy of Roma, which has close commercial ties with Mexico.\n\n\"We don't know how that's going to impact us,\" he said, a tint of worry in his voice.\n\n-- Edgar Sandoval\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"In an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night, President Donald Trump denounced Biden-era policies, mocked Democrats and lauded his administration's early hailstorm of executive actions.

State authorities and local activists say Vance’s itinerary also likely includes a visit to Shelby Park, a municipal greenspace along the Rio Grande that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott seized from federal authorities last year in a feud with the Biden administration. Abbott accused that administration of not doing enough to curb illegal crossings.\n\n“Border security is national security,” Hegseth told Fox News before the trip. He added, “We’re sending those folks home, and we’re not letting more in. And you’re seeing that right now.”\n\nTrump made a crackdown on immigration a centerpiece of his reelection campaign, pledging to halt the tide of migrants entering the U.S. and stop the flow of fentanyl crossing the border. As part of that effort, he imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, saying neither is doing enough to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration.\n\n“They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast,” Trump said of migrants living in the U.S. illegally as he delivered an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nAlthough Trump has not made a trip to the border since Inauguration Day, the visit of three of his top officials is evidence of the scope of his administration’s focus on the issue. He has tasked agencies across the federal government with working to overhaul border and immigration policy, moving well beyond the Department of Homeland Security, the traditional home of most such functions.\n\nArrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico plummeted 39% in January from a month earlier, though they’ve been falling sharply since well before Trump took office on Jan. 20 from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023. Since then, Mexican authorities increased enforcement within their own borders and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, introduced severe asylum restrictions early last summer.\n\nThe Trump administration has showcased its new initiatives, including putting shackled immigrants on U.S. military planes for deportation fights and sending some to the U.S. lockup at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. It has also expanded federal agents’ arrests of people in the U.S. illegally and abandoned programs that gave some permission to stay.\n\nTrump border czar Tom Homan said migrants with criminal records have been prioritized in early efforts to round up and deport people in the U.S. illegally, but he added of other migrants, “If you’re in the county illegally, you’re not off the table.”\n\n“When we find the bad guy, many times they’re with others, others who aren’t a criminal priority, but were in the country illegally,” Homan told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday. “They’re coming, too.”\n\nSince Trump’s second term began, about 6,500 new active duty forces have been ordered to deploy to the southern border. Before that, there were about 2,500 troops already there, largely National Guard troops on active duty orders, along with a couple of hundred active duty aviation forces.\n\nOf those being mobilized, many are still only preparing to go. Last weekend, Hegseth approved orders to send a large portion of an Army Stryker brigade and a general support aviation battalion to the border. Totaling about 3,000 troops, they are expected to deploy in the coming weeks.\n\nTroops are responsible for detection and monitoring along the border but don’t interact with migrants attempting to illegally cross. Instead, they alert border agents, who then take the migrants into custody.\n\nBiden tasked Vice President Kamala Harris with tackling the root causes of immigration during his administration, seeking to zero in on why so many migrants, particularly from Central America, were leaving their homelands and coming to the U.S. seeking asylum or trying to make it into the county illegally.\n\nHarris made her first visit to the border in June 2021, about 3 1/2 months deeper into Biden’s term than Vance’s trip in the opening weeks of Trump’s second term. Trump has routinely joked that Harris was in charge of immigration policy but didn’t visit the border or even maintain close phone contact with federal officials.\n\nVance’s trip also comes as the Trump administration is considering the use of the Alien Enemy Act of 1798 to detain and deport Venezuelans based on a proclamation labeling the gang Tren de Aragua an invasion force that could be acting at the behest of that country’s government. That’s according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nIt is unclear how close the decisions are to being finalized. Some officials have questioned whether the gang is acting as a tool for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom the U.S. has not recognized as that country’s legitimate leader. There are some concerns that invoking the law would require the U.S. to more formally recognize Maduro.\n\nStill, the 1798 law allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country with which the U.S. is at war, and it has been mentioned by Trump as a possible tool to speed up his mass deportations.\n\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

(AP) — Stephen Watson served in the Marines for 22 years and receives care through the Department of Veterans Affairs for a traumatic brain injury. He supports President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk’s cost-cutting program — even if it affects the VA.\n\n“We’re no better because we’re veterans,” said Watson, 68, of Jesup, Georgia. “We all need to take a step back and realize that everybody’s gonna have to take a little bit on the chin to get these budget matters under control.”\n\nGregg Bafundo served during the first Gulf War and has nerve damage to his feet from carrying loads of weight as a Marine mortarman. He says he may need to turn to the VA for care after being fired as a wilderness ranger and firefighter through the layoffs at the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n“They’re going to put guys like me and my fellow Marines that rely on the VA in the ground,” said Bafundo, 53, who lives in Tonasket, Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration’s move to end hundreds of VA contracts — initially paused after public outcry — and ongoing layoffs are affecting the nation’s veterans, a critical and politically influential constituency. More than 9 million veterans get physical and mental health care from the VA, which is now being examined by Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe VA manages a $350 billion-plus budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals. Veterans have shown up at town hall-style meetings with Republican lawmakers to voice their anger, and groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars are mobilizing against cuts.\n\nThe department is considering a reorganization that could include cutting 80,000 jobs, according to an internal memo obtained by the Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nVeterans were much likelier to support Trump, a Republican, than Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in November’s presidential election, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states. Nearly 6 in 10 voters who are veterans backed Trump, while about 4 in 10 voted for Harris.\n\nJoy Ilem, national legislative director for the nonpartisan group Disabled American Veterans, said her group was studying how the ongoing cuts might affect care.\n\n“You could lose trust among the veteran population over some of these things that have happened and the way that they’ve happened,” Ilem warned. “And we do fear damage to the recruitment and retention of hiring the best and brightest to serve veterans.”\n\nThe White House said last week that it wants to slash $2 billion worth of VA contracts, which would affect anything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The department quickly paused the cuts following concerns about the impact on critical health services.\n\nVA Secretary Doug Collins told Fox News Channel this week that the effort was focused on “finding deficiencies.”\n\n“Anything that we’re doing is designed and will not cut veterans’ health or veterans’ benefits that they’ve earned,” he said.\n\nIn a Tuesday statement to The Associated Press, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency “is putting Veterans at the center of everything the department does.”\n\n“Every dollar we spend on wasteful contracts, non-mission-critical or duplicative activities is one less dollar we can spend on Veterans, and given that choice, we will always side with the Veteran,” Kasperowicz wrote.\n\nRepublicans have pointed out that the VA has rehired employees who were let go during an initial round of layoffs in February, such as those working for a crisis hotline. However, during a subsequent round of layoffs, the VA cut 15 other employees who were in jobs supporting the crisis line, including a trainer for the phone responders, according to congressional staff who are tracking the cuts.\n\nThe VA has long faced calls for reform\n\nThe VA has been plagued for years by allegations of poor medical care and excessively long wait times. Investigators a decade ago uncovered widespread problems in how VA hospitals were scheduling appointments after allegations that as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting care at the department’s Phoenix hospital. A group of employees accused the department of retaliating against potential whistleblowers. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, eventually put into place a program allowing veterans to go outside the VA system to seek medical care. The Choice Program was extended by Trump during his first term.\n\nRichard Lamb, who was shot down twice in Vietnam as an Army helicopter crew chief, said the department should be “cut to the bone.”\n\nLamb, 74, said he broke vertebrae each time his helicopter was shot down. Decades passed, he said, before a VA doctor acknowledged he had compression fractures. Lamb later had a private doctor perform surgery on his back after he said the VA wouldn’t perform the procedure.\n\n“I’d be happy to see VA, not torn down, but cleaned up, cleaned out and recast,” said Lamb, who lives in Waco, Texas. “The VA is supposed to be a wonderful thing for veterans. It’s not. It sucks.”\n\nDaniel Ragsdale Combs, a Navy veteran with a traumatic brain injury, strongly disagrees.\n\nRagsdale Combs, 45, suffered his injury while running to respond to an order on an aircraft carrier and striking his head above a hatchway. He receives group therapy for mental illness brought on by the injury but says he had heard those sessions might be canceled or reduced due to staffing shortages.\n\n“I’m deeply concerned because the VA has been nothing but great to me,” said Ragsdale Combs, who lives in Mesa, Arizona. “I’m angry, upset and frustrated.”\n\nLucy Wong relies on a team of VA doctors in the Phoenix area to treat her scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that attacks connective tissue. She said she developed the disease as a medical technician in the Navy in the 1980s, working with toxic chemicals and enduring extreme stress.\n\nDriving is difficult. She worries that the VA will cut Uber rides to her medical appointments, among other things.\n\n“I ask if Trump is cutting anything back here, and the reply is, ‘Not yet,’” Wong said.\n\nJosh Ghering, a former Marine from Parsons, Kansas, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he had to fly to San Antonio for an appointment with a neurologist before he was medically retired for back issues, including herniated discs. He questioned why he couldn’t get the same appointment closer to home.\n\n“I think they’re headed in the right direction,” Ghering, 42, said of DOGE. “But they’re going to have to be more thorough with what it is they’re doing, to make sure they’re not cutting jobs that are needed.”\n\nWill service members be expected to accept VA cuts?\n\nThe nation’s service members have never been a political monolith — and the same holds true for their views on the VA. But the split between two Marines on opposite sides of the country raises a question not just about DOGE but about America’s military: Who is expected to sacrifice?\n\nWatson, the former Marine in Georgia, sustained various injuries while serving, including a traumatic brain injury when a cable snapped and a crate fell on him. He said he’s willing to accept fewer visits to his VA doctor and forgo other conveniences as a matter of service to the country.\n\n“Many veterans who voted for Trump understood this was going to be his policy and are now screaming bloody murder because the axe is going to fall upon the VA,” Watson said. “And to me, that’s just a little bit self-centered.”\n\nBafundo, the Marine in Washington state, pushed back against the idea that all Americans are making a sacrifice when, as he sees it, it’s really falling back “on the little guy.”\n\nAmerica’s billionaires won’t be shouldering any of the burden, he argued, while Musk, who’s the world’s richest person, and others pay little, if any, taxes.\n\n“If we’re going to sacrifice, the wealthy need to sacrifice, too,” he said. “And, frankly, they don’t.”\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that decades passed before a VA doctor acknowledged Lamb’s compression fractures. A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that a private doctor discovered the injury.\n\nGroves reported from Washington.","summary":"The VA is now being examined by Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/03/05/veterans-speak-out-va-budget-cuts/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Trump_DOGE_Veterans_Affairs_86789.jpg?w=1024&h=682","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 19:24:31","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.093},{"id":297083352,"title":"Bonus Daily Cartoon: Giving Up for Lent","text":"Skip to main content\n\nBooks & Culture\nFiction & Poetry\nHumor & Cartoons\n\nPuzzles & Games\n\n100th Anniversary\n\nOpen Navigation Menu\n\nDaily Cartoon\nBonus Daily Cartoon: Giving Up for Lent\n\nBy Emily FlakeMarch 5, 2025\n\n“Oh, it’s not ashes—just too many facepalms watching that speech last night.”\nCartoon by Emily Flake\n\nSave this storySave this story\n\nSave this storySave this story\n\nBuy New Yorker Cartoons »\n\nMore Humor and Cartoons\n\nIf I went to law school, according to my mom.\n\nSubway crushes: Where are they now?\n\nEarth: updated terms and conditions.\n\nReviews are in for “The Female Joker.”\n\nAvant-garde wedding concepts for your totally original nuptials.\n\nExcerpts from the book that man is reading on the subway.\n\nEnter the Cartoon Caption Contest for a chance to appear in the magazine.\nFollow @newyorkercartoons on Instagram and sign up for the Daily Humor newsletter for more funny stuff.\n\nEmily Flake, a New Yorker cartoonist, has published books including “Joke in a Box: How to Write and Draw Jokes.”\n\nDaily Humor\nThe Daily Cartoon, Shouts, and other funny stuff from our Dept. of Hoopla.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our User Agreement and Privacy Policy & Cookie Statement.

On Tuesday, Trump repeated or alluded to those claims and more during a nearly two-hour address to Congress — his first as the 47th president — that often returned to one of his favorite topics. \"The media and our friends in the Democrat Party kept saying we needed new legislation, we must have legislation to secure the border. But it turned out that all we really needed was a new president,\" Trump said to applause from Republican lawmakers. In the audience were familiar faces — people Trump has referenced to make points about immigration. Among them were the mother and sister of Laken Riley, a 22-year-old nursing student who was killed last year in Athens, Ga., by a recently arrived Venezuelan immigrant. Immigration officials said Jose Ibarra, the man convicted of murdering Riley, had entered the United States illegally and had been allowed to stay in the country while he pursued his immigration case. Riley's family joined Trump on the campaign trail. A bill named after her, which mandates federal detention for immigrants charged with theft-related crimes, became the first signed by Trump in his second term. Also in attendance was Alexis Nungaray, the mother of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who was killed last year in Houston; two other recently arrived immigrants from Venezuela have been charged with murdering her. Alexis Nungaray joined Trump last year during a campaign event at the southern U.S. border. Some of Trump's claims Tuesday on immigration have previously been debunked. Listing off what he viewed as unnecessary federal programs uncovered by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency, Trump referred to \"$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City.\" Musk said millions of dollars meant for disaster relief were spent illegally by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to house migrants in \"high-end\" hotels. The claim led to the firing of four federal employees and the suspension of payments to New York for migrant housing. But it wasn't FEMA money — the money is administered by FEMA on behalf of U.S. Customs and Border Protection for its Shelter and Services Program, which supports local governments and nonprofits that help arriving migrants. In fiscal year 2024, the average daily rate for rooms contracted through an agreement with the Hotel Assn. of New York City was $156, according to a report by the city's comptroller's office. Similarly, Trump falsely accused Biden last year of running out of disaster funding after spending it all on migrants. Criticizing the record arrivals at the southern border under Biden, Trump said \"many of them were murderers, human traffickers, gang members and other criminals from the streets of dangerous cities all throughout the world.\" Researchers have found that undocumented immigrants commit crimes at substantially lower rates than native-born citizens. \"Joe Biden didn't just open our borders,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"He flew illegal aliens over them to overwhelm our schools, hospitals and communities throughout the country.\" The claim that Biden secretly flew hundreds of thousands of migrants into the U.S., elevated by a right-leaning group called the Center for Immigration Studies, actually referred to people vetted and authorized for travel under a program that allowed in people from certain countries who could fund their own plane tickets. Even Springfield, Ohio, made a flitting comeback in Trump's speech on Tuesday. During a debate last year with his Democratic opponent, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump repeated a false viral rumor that Haitian immigrants in Sprinfield were \"eating the pets of the people that live there.\" Springfield became inundated with hoax bomb threats that forced lockdowns, evacuations and closures at hospitals, schools and government buildings. \"Entire towns like Aurora, Colo., and Springfield, Ohio, buckled under the weight of the migrant occupation and corruption like nobody's ever seen before,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"Beautiful towns destroyed.\" Some misleading statements were new. For example, Trump said February had \"by far the lowest ever recorded\" numbers of illegal border crossings. News outlets reported that the Border Patrol recorded around 8,300 arrests of migrants who attempted to unlawfully cross the U.S.-Mexico border between ports of entry. Border Patrol's own data going back to fiscal year 1925 show multiple instances in which the average monthly arrests fell below 8,000 per month, most recently in 1967. Angelica Salas, executive director of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, said Trump's statements on immigration were unsurprising. \"He is obsessed with 0.04% of the population (13 million undocumented) and wants to place in their lap all the ills of this nation,\" Salas said in a statement after the speech.","summary":"Trump repeated false claims he made on the campaign trail, including that Biden secretly flew migrants into the U.S. and that many immigrants are violent criminals.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-03-05/trumps-address-to-congress-revived-false-or-misleading-claims-on-immigration","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/dbefc85/2147483647/strip/true/crop/8059x4231+0+571/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F02%2F73%2F9fdb4b414a9cb1a5abe996c6c68f%2Ftrump-speech-86767.j","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 18:34:09","author":"Andrea Castillo","authors":["Andrea Castillo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.169},{"id":297064002,"title":"BASTASCH: Here’s How One Reporter Exposed The Left’s $20 Billion Climate Slush Fund","text":"The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) — yes, the agency that’s supposed to make sure the air and water is clean — has been caught red-handed in what, at least on the outside, looks like one of the most brazen and high-dollar left-wing political payouts of the century.\n\nIn what Trump EPA described in a letter to the agency inspector general’s office as “an unprecedented arrangement,” Biden-era bureaucrats used private Citibank bank accounts to squirrel away $20 billion in taxpayer funds — that’s right, billion with a “b” — much of which is earmarked for lefty “pass-through” organizations the agency itself determined “lacked basic financial competency.” (RELATED: DAVID BLACKMON: Will Lee Zeldin Be Able To Claw Back $20 Billion In EPA Gold Bars?)\n\nThis $20 billion was ostensibly meant for “green banks” to finance all sorts of nice-sounding “climate justice” and green energy projects — but instead it steered billions upon billions to groups deeply tied into the Democratic Party machinery.\n\nFor instance, the current and former chairmen of one of the pass-throughs, called the Coalition for Green Capital (CGC), are both Democratic Party donors, each cutting sizable checks to Kamala Harris’ ill-fated 2024 run. CGC was on track to get $5 billion from Biden’s EPA.\n\nIn another case, a left-wing consortium tied to Stacey Abrams’s voter mobilization group was awarded $2 billion. In its letter to the IG, Trump’s EPA noted the former administration itself determined these groups “lacked basic financial competency,” but earmarked the cash anyway.\n\nSo, here we have billions in taxpayer funds being directed to Democratic insiders and donors — paging DOGE! No wonder bureaucrats shoveled this money into a seemingly untouchable Citibank account in the waning days of the Biden administration.\n\nOne former Biden EPA official was reportedly caught on tape gleefully comparing it to “tossing gold bars off the Titanic.”\n\nTaken together, this looks like the left-wing political payout of the century. Rarely is rank political patronage so nakedly on display.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department (DOJ) and FBI are currently asking tough questions of career EPA officials about these “gold bars,” but it’s unclear if the Trump EPA will be able to claw back any of the funds.\n\nAccountability — after four years of virtually none of it — would not only be a victory for taxpayers, but also for good journalism.\n\nIt’s important to remember we’re only talking about this Biden EPA scandal because of the tireless efforts of one journalist. Long before the EPA inspector general, DOJ, the FBI, or even the Department of Government Efficiency, were alerted to this political payout, a reporter named Nick Pope was on the case.\n\nBack in November 2023, when the Biden EPA announced it was handing out billions to so-called “green banks” in the name of “climate justice” and other high causes, Pope thought this might be the perfect cover for the Democratic Party to enrich itself at taxpayer expense.\n\nNo slouch, Pope dug in, and soon he saw smoke. Huge, billowing clouds of smoke. His first piece, published that same month, laid out in detail how the “green banks” on the shortlist for Biden EPA funding “all feature numerous individuals on their boards who work for influential organizations aligned with the Democratic Party or previously worked for Democratic administrations.”\n\nBut this was no one-off. Pope followed up when the EPA announced it was handing billions to the very groups he had just exposed as essentially being Democratic Party pass-throughs.\n\nGovernment watchdog groups were put on alert. Congress eventually got involved, demanding answers from the Biden EPA about how something like this could even happen. Pope’s colleague Adam Pack left his own mark, first reporting about the billions going to the liberal consortium affiliated with Abrams’ get-out-the-vote efforts.\n\nEven after the FBI got involved, Pope didn’t rest, pushing out yet another hard-hitting investigation exposing how heads of the groups slated to get billions in Biden bucks “collectively made hundreds of thousands of dollars in personal political donations to Democratic candidates and organizations in recent years.”\n\nIf Trump is actually able to claw back these “gold bars,” make sure to thank Nick Pope. Heck, even if we don’t get the money back, thank him anyway. Good journalism should be rewarded even if the ultimate outcome isn’t exactly what we wanted.\n\nBesides, they don’t give out Pulitzers for exposing Democratic corruption, now do they?\n\nWhile trust in media plummets, and the legacy press continues its liberal bootlicking, it’s even more important we support good journalists, like Pope and the rest of the Daily Caller News Foundation team, who are unafraid to report the truth and hold the powerful accountable.\n\nMike Bastasch is editor-in-chief of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author and do not reflect the official position of the Daily Caller News Foundation.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Not a single Senate Democrat voted yes, and the bill failed to obtain the necessary number of votes to advance. \n\nI am a radical feminist, a Democrat, and a TERF, an acronym that used to stand for “trans-exclusionary radical feminist,” but now means any woman on the Left who knows that sex is real and is not afraid to say so. I have been speaking out about this issue for 10 years. In 2019, I was essentially forced to resign from my job, effectively ending a nearly 20-year career in criminal law and justice because I say out loud that women and girls exist as a sex class, a class that does not include men who claim to have female gender identities.\n\nMen are male and women are female, regardless of any claimed identity, and there are Democrats all over this country who understand this to be true. Yet, for years, most media outlets have refused to acknowledge that fact. The Democratic Party actively denies it. \n\nOn the day the bill passed in 2023, I published an article with the Washington Examiner titled, “Why progressives should support the Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act,” where I explained why the Democrats should support it. I explained that I hear every day from rank-and-file Democrats, some more progressive, others more moderate, who are appalled at what the Democratic Party is doing to women’s rights at the altar of gender ideology.\n\nNot a single Democrat voted yes on that day in 2023, and the bill did not advance in the Senate. This time, it did, and Senate Democrats had an opportunity to demonstrate to voters across the political spectrum that they care about women and girls as a sex class. Shamefully, they failed to do so.\n\nIn 2023, my evidence that Democratic voters support female-only sports was anecdotal. But now we have data to back it up. In January, polling was released by the New York Times and Ipsos showing that 79% of voters (including 67% of Democrats and 64% of independents) support this sensible approach. And we know from post-election polling that one reason former Vice President Kamala Harris lost the presidential election was that she was “focused more on cultural issues like transgender issues rather than helping the middle class.”\n\nElected Democrats aren’t trying to decimate women’s rights because they don’t know any better. In the past few weeks, the following Democratic and independent senators either ignored or declined requests from constituent Democrats or former Democrats to discuss the bill: Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-NV), John Fetterman (D-PA), Ruben Gallego (D-AZ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Mark Kelly (D-AZ), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Angus King (I-ME), Jon Ossoff (D-GA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Jacky Rosen (D-NV), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), and Mark Warner (D-VA). \n\nEach constituent’s meeting request noted that tennis champion and registered Democrat Martina Navratilova was willing to join the meeting virtually. Each of these senators passed up an opportunity to meet with his or her own constituents (many of them female athletes) and one of the greatest female athletes of all time.\n\nOn Feb. 20 and Feb. 21, I was joined by Australian women’s rights activists Sall Grover and Kath Deves at the Capitol. Between those two days, we visited every single Senate Democratic office to explain why it’s important to vote yes on the bill. Some offices took our materials politely; others offered a frosty reception. No office followed up.\n\nThis is a pathetic performance from the party that claims to stand for women and defend our democracy. It’s insulting to the countless female Democrats who voted these senators into office, and to Democrats all over the country who care about the sex-based rights of women and girls. \n\nVoting to remove female athletes’ rights to fair competition, opportunities for achievement, physical safety, and bodily privacy is repugnant. Doing so while ignoring their own Democratic constituents’ opposition shows us exactly what they think of American women and girls and the democratic process. It’s a slap in the face to all American women and girls and to their own voters. \n\nIn 2023, I published the book The Reckoning: How the Democrats Betrayed Women and Girls. It was meant to serve partly as a warning to Democratic Party leaders of what was likely to happen in November 2024 if they did not reverse course. They did not.\n\nI was watching a football game when I first saw a “Kamala is for they/them. President Trump is for you” commercial last fall. I nearly fell out of my chair. I thought, “That’s it; it’s over.” And it was.\n\nAnd now, the Democrats in the Senate have betrayed women and girls again. Democrats need to do better or get used to losing. Women won’t forget.\n\nKara Dansky is the author of The Abolition of Sex and The Reckoning.

Trump indicated during his Tuesday evening address to Congress that he spoke with leaders from some of the nation&apos;s largest auto manufacturers who are \"so excited\" about the incoming tariffs. Trump said his tariffs on automobiles, which began for Canadian and Mexican imports this week, will bring a \"boom\" to the U.S. auto industry. He also reaffirmed his plan to levy even further tariffs against other countries beginning April 2. \"Tariffs are a powerful tool in the toolbox for undoing the injustice of anti-worker trade deals. We are glad to see an American president take aggressive action on ending the free trade disaster that has dropped like a bomb on the working class,\" the UAW said in a Tuesday statement. TRUMP&apos;S LATEST TARIFFS: HERE IS WHAT WILL COST CONSUMERS MORE \"There’s been a lot of talk of these tariffs ‘disrupting’ the economy,\" the group added. \"But if corporate America chooses to price-gouge the American consumer or attack the American worker because they don’t want to pay their fair share, corporate America bears the blame for that decision.\" The UAW statement slammed the previous North American Free Trade Agreement, arguing the working class were the ones facing the brunt of its negative impacts. \"We want to see corporate America, from the auto industry and beyond, recommit to the working class,\" the UAW statement added. The labor union said they have been engaging in active negotiations with Trump to bring an end to what the UAW described as an ongoing \"free trade disaster,\" and plan to help continue to shape the administration&apos;s auto tariffs to ensure they benefit the working class. CANADIAN PREMIER THREATENS TO CUT OFF ENERGY TO US IN RESPONSE TO TRUMP TARIFFS: ‘THEY NEED TO FEEL THE PAIN’ \"We want to see serious action that will incentivize companies to change their behavior, reinvest in America, and stop cheating the American worker, the American consumer, and the American taxpayer,\" the group said in their statement. Despite the UAW&apos;s support for Trump&apos;s tariff plans, other auto industry experts remain skeptical of the president&apos;s actions. \"You just can&apos;t relocate automotive production and the supply chain overnight,\" said John Bozzella, who heads the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, according to Reuters. \"That&apos;s the challenge and the dilemma: auto tariffs in North America could end up increasing costs on consumers before jobs come back to the country.\" Bozzella&apos;s concern that auto manufacturers would have a difficult time pivoting at the drop of a hat was echoed by Erik Gordon, a business school professor at the University of Michigan. Bozzella argued \"years of work and tens of millions of dollars can go out the window\" if the government&apos;s policy presents too radical of a change too quickly. MAJOR TRUMP TARIFF MOVE LIKELY TO BENEFIT THIS HEARTLAND AMERICAN CITY A litany of the globe&apos;s biggest automakers have also released a slew of statements challenging the claims that Trump&apos;s tariffs will be good for the auto industry. \"We strongly urge the U.S. government to reconsider its decision to impose tariffs, which is already affecting American jobs, economic growth, and families across the country,\" a statement from Volkswagen Group says. \"The tariffs are having a devastating impact on the automotive industry and are increasing costs, disrupting supply chains, harming American dealerships, and reducing vehicle affordability for consumers.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP Fox News Digital reached out to the UAW for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication.","summary":"The United Automobile Workers Union, which endorsed then-Vice President Kamala Harris during the 2024 election, is backing President Donald Trump&apos;s tariffs on foreign imports, arguing it is a big win for the middle class.","url":"https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/largest-labor-unions-kamala-harris-praises-trump-tariffs","image":"https://static.foxbusiness.com/foxbusiness.com/content/uploads/2025/03/trump_uaw_cropped_final.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 17:09:27","author":"Alec Schemmel","authors":["Alec Schemmel"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":297036480,"title":"NASA's stranded astronauts finally snap as they appear to let slip who's to blame for leaving them there","text":"NASA's stranded astronauts finally snap as they appear to let slip who's to blame for leaving them there\n\nREAD MORE: Stranded astronauts will be stretchered to hospital upon return \n\nBy ELLYN LAPOINTE FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 16:31 GMT, 5 March 2025 | Updated: 16:41 GMT, 5 March 2025\n\nNASA's stranded astronauts have put on a brave face throughout their uncertain nine-month stay on the International Space Station - but that appeared to slip in a recent interview.\n\nBarry Wilmore seemed to suggest he and his crewmate Sunita Williams had been caught up in political games in Washington.\n\nSpaceX Chief Executive Elon Musk, whose spaceflight company was tasked with bringing Williams and Wilmore home later this month, has repeatedly said the Biden administration 'abandoned' them for 'political reasons.'\n\nMusk has also said that former president Joe Biden rejected his offer to bring the astronauts home early because it would've made Donald Trump and his supporters 'look good.'\n\nDuring a Tuesday press conference, Williams and Wilmore were asked if the Biden administration did in fact decline Musk's offer to bring them home early, to which Wilmore replied that Musk's claim 'is absolutely factual.' \n\n'I can only say that Mr Musk, what he says, is absolutely factual,' Wilmore said, noting he and Williams were not briefed on what happened behind closed doors. So I believe him. I don't know all those details, and I don't think any of us really can give you the answer that maybe that you would be hoping for,' he added.\n\nThe astronaut then gushed over Trump and Musk, saying 'we have the utmost respect for them.' \n\nDuring a Tuesday news briefing, NASA astronauts Barry Wilmore (left) Sunita Williams (right) and Nick Hague (center) took questions from reporters, and the Starliner astronauts finally weighed in on claims that politics influenced the decision to keep them in space\n\nThe interview comes just weeks after Trump told Musk to 'go get' the astronauts as soon as possible, leading to slightly earlier return date set for March 19 or 20. \n\nWilliams and Wilmore arrived at the ISS on June 6 aboard Boeing's Starliner spacecraft for what was supposed to be an eight-day stay.\n\nThe spacecraft suffered numerous technical issues before, during and after the launch, and NASA determined it would be too risky to allow the astronauts to return to Earth in Starliner.\n\nThe agency sent the spacecraft home uncrewed in September. When NASA officials announced that decision, then-NASA administrator Bill Nelson said: 'I can tell you unequivocally, from a personal standpoint, that politics has not played any part in this decision. It absolutely has nothing to do with it.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to NASA for comment on Musk's recent claims, which suggest otherwise. \n\nSince September, the Starliner astronauts have been waiting to hitch a ride home on SpaceX's Crew-9 return flight, which is now scheduled to depart from the ISS on March 19. \n\nBut during the nine months they have spent on the space station, their return date has changed multiple times, and this has stirred up a political debate spearheaded by Musk. \n\n'Obviously we've heard some of these different things that are being said,' Wilmore said during the Tuesday briefing. \n\nWilliams and Wilmore have said they do not feel 'stranded' or 'abandoned' on the International Space Station (ISS), even though their stay — which was supposed to last eight days — has now dragged on for nine months \n\nElon Musk has said the Biden administration rejected his offer to bring Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore home early because of his support for Donald Trump\n\n'I can tell you, at the outset, all of us have the utmost respect for Mr. Musk, and obviously respect and admiration for our President of the United States, Donald Trump.'\n\nDuring a Friday appearance on Joe Rogan's podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience, Musk said the Biden administration did not want to jeopardize Kamala Harris' presidential campaign and intentionally 'pushed the return date past the inauguration date.'\n\nMusk backed Trump during the 2024 presidential race, donating at least $288 million to his campaign and appearing at several MAGA rallies. \n\nIn Musk's eyes, allowing him to bring the Starliner crew home early would have made Trump look like a hero. He also told Rogan that the Biden administration was suing SpaceX at the time.\n\n'So people say, like, 'Oh, Elon's making it up. The Biden administration wasn't against SpaceX,' he said.\n\n'I'm like, bro, the Department of Justice had a massive lawsuit against SpaceX for not hiring asylum seekers, even though it is illegal for us to hire anyone who is not a permanent resident.'\n\nStranded NASA astronauts' 'secret' message to the public, revealed by body language expert JUDI JAMES\n\nTrump has supported Musk's claims that the Biden administration left Williams and Wilmore in space, saying in January that the former president 'virtually abandoned them.'\n\nSpeaking about Trump and Musk during Tuesday's briefing, Wilmore said: 'We appreciate them, we appreciate all they do for us, for human spaceflight, for our nation. We're thankful that they're in the positions they're in.'\n\n'The words they've said — politics — I mean, that's part of life. \n\n'We understand that, and there's an important reason why we have a political system, and the political system that we do have. And we're behind it 100 percent.\n\n'We know what we've lived up here. We know the ins and outs and the specifics that they may not be privy to. And I'm sure they have some issues that they're dealing with, information that they have that we are not privy to. \n\n'So when I think about your question, that's part of life. We are on board with it, we support our nation, we support our nation's leaders and we're thankful for them.'\n\nShare or comment on this article:\nNASA's stranded astronauts finally snap as they appear to let slip who's to blame for leaving them there\n\nAdd comment","summary":"During a Tuesday news briefing, NASA's stranded astronauts said Elon Musk's claim that the Biden administration declined his offer to bring them home sooner is 'absolutely factual.'","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-14464311/Stranded-NASA-astronauts-shocking-admission-abandoned-blame.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/03/05/15/95868683-0-image-m-9_1741187063001.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 16:41:57","author":"Editor,Ellyn Lapointe","authors":["Editor","Ellyn Lapointe"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.515},{"id":297033854,"title":"Daily Cartoon: Wednesday, March 5th","text":"Skip to main content\n\nBooks & Culture\nFiction & Poetry\nHumor & Cartoons\n\nPuzzles & Games\n\n100th Anniversary\n\nOpen Navigation Menu\n\nDaily Cartoon\nDaily Cartoon: Wednesday, March 5th\n\nBy Brendan LoperMarch 5, 2025\n\n“Wait, are we bidding?

First story we’re talking about on Today in Ohio. It’s the news podcast discussion from cleveland.com and the Plain Dealer. I’m Chris Quinn here with Courtney Astolfi, Lisa Garvin and Laura Johnston. And Laura, Donald Trump did institute the steep tariffs on products from Mexico, China, and your native Canada. A move many predict will trash our economy.\n\nHow soon and how are people in Northeast Ohio likely to feel the pain?\n\nLaura (00:36.534)\n\nWe could see this very quickly in our grocery bills. Prices up about 25 % possibly. And that’s according to an expert who studies these kinds of things. Sabrina Eaton wrote the story. The thing is, Trump campaigned for a promise to drop food costs on day one. He said, know, grocery bills are expensive. I’m going to do this. He had a press conference in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he was surrounded by like cereal boxes and milk jugs and was promising to cut\n\nour grocery bills. honestly, I think that’s why a lot of people voted for him. It was a reaction to Biden and Kamala Harris. And he said, I’m going to make it easier for average everyday Americans to afford their basic needs. And people thought, OK, he can do this, right? Obviously, the president does not have the control to set prices in grocery stores. But when you add tariffs of 25 % with two countries that send us a lot of our fresh produce and meat and other products,\n\nit is going to feel, we’re going to feel it in part because the countries are going to put up their own tariffs too. So it’s gonna go back and forth and we are going to feel it quickly. If you ever looked across Lake Erie and saw a greenish glow on the horizon, those are the greenhouses of Leamington, Ontario. And we get a lot of our tomatoes and cucumbers and other vegetable products from there. Obviously Mexico supplies all sorts of fruit and vegetables and beverages.\n\nAlso from Canada, we get a lot of beef products, cocoa, frozen potatoes, which surprised me, and pork. Also canola, which is vegetable oil, that’s a big crop there. So I think we’re gonna see it pretty fast.\n\nChris Quinn (02:16.02)\n\nAnd there’s no reason for it. He’s saying, I want to stop the flow of fentanyl. There is no flow of fentanyl. He wants to stop in Mexico the illegal border crossings. That’s over. There is no border crossings. mean, there is no ultimatum here. There’s no end game. He’s just doing it to do it. It’s going to trash the economy. The more I hear about it, the more I think this is just a page out of the fascist playbook. Let’s destroy the economy.\n\nLaura (02:23.309)\n\nChris Quinn (02:45.286)\n\nand create fear among the people because that’s how we want to rule. It just doesn’t make sense. And when you look at that, there have been some great stories that look at the auto industry. Ohio is big in the auto industry. There are no cars that are made in Canada or Mexico and brought here. There are cars that might be assembled in Mexico, but the motors and other parts are made in America, shipped to Mexico or Canada. Then it comes back.\n\nLaura (02:50.861)\n\nChris Quinn (03:13.46)\n\nAnd vice versa in all of these cars that we’re talking about, maybe 30 % of it is American or Mexican or Canadian. It’s a, it’s a very cooperative venture. So how, what are you going to do? get, if we make the engine and other parts for the cars, send them to Canada where they assemble them. Are we going to charge a 25 % tariff, even though it’s supporting a bunch of American jobs to make the stuff that, that the car is made from. It makes no sense. And that.\n\nThat is scary because then you have to look for the sinister motive. I couldn’t believe Bernie Moreno. This is good. It’s short-term pain, but it’s good for the auto industry. Explain that. How is this good for the auto industry?\n\nLaura (03:53.794)\n\nYeah. The thing is we’ve cultivated this relationship for decades, with NAFTA, this idea of free trade between North American countries. The idea was the best areas with the best people would make the things that are best suited for. So yes, things go back and forth across the border. If you’re raw materials, you’re making the steel, you’re sending it back, they’re making a product, they’re sending it back. I just...\n\nLisa (03:57.799)\n\nLaura (04:19.53)\n\nIt goes back and forth because that’s the way that we’ve done it because we’ve had this incredibly friendly border back and forth. And we realized that the best way to move forward and have economic prosperity was to work together. And that is just, we’re just making enemies of everyone. And the idea that Trump says that we’re subsidizing Canada because there’s a trade imbalance, it’s because they’re using all the energy from Canada. They’re using the natural gas and the oil and the things out of the ground to power\n\nthe population of the United States because the Canadian population is so much smaller. It’s like 40 million, which is a little bigger than California. But that’s not going to get solved with tariffs.\n\nChris Quinn (05:02.696)\n\nWell, and if Canada wants to, they’ll cut off that energy and all of our energy bills will go up along with our grocery bills. There’s just no justification for this. This is crazy town. It’s going to cause pain. I just don’t, other than trying to make people afraid and it’s working. Look, look how many people are cowering in front of him. Jeff Bezos and every business person. mean, the Democrats in Congress were like cattle in this thing. They should have marched out when\n\nLisa (05:07.943)\n\nLisa (05:22.215)\n\nChris Quinn (05:31.528)\n\nwhen one of their number was removed they should be screaming about this they should be holding the town halls because the republicans now are being told not to because we’ve made everybody angry\n\nLisa (05:41.509)\n\nWell, they’re talking, there are some Democratic lawmakers that want to hold town halls in red districts.\n\nChris Quinn (05:47.762)\n\nThat they should they they they said that the people need to be heard. And instead, I think this whole thing is made to make them afraid. And then you got toadies like Bernie Moreno saying this is just some short term pain. It’s good for the industry. And he’s just a suck up to a crazy president. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. What’s the reasoning behind an Ohio lawmakers proposal to make gym memberships tax deductible, Courtney?\n\nLaura (06:04.814)\n\nand the thing is, we don’t even know-\n\nCourtney (06:14.178)\n\nYeah, the incentive here is we want Ohioans to get healthier. At least that’s the thought process behind state Senator Al Cotrona. He’s from Mahoning County and he proposed legislation Tuesday in committee that would let Ohioans deduct up to $1,500 a year from their reportable state income for those who itemize their tax returns. And that would be for money spent on gym memberships and personal training throughout the year. This would include fees like\n\nrenewal fees, monthly fees, know, whatever it costs to get into the gym. And it would apply to places like athletic clubs, health spas, and just normal gyms. Koutrona said this plan would nudge Ohioans toward healthier and more active lifestyles. He said it would also be an investment to arrive at cost savings that come from better physical health. Ohio is not the healthiest, right? You know, more than a third of the state.\n\nWe’re considered obese in 2023. That puts us at 11th in the nation. And he sees this as a path forward to help get us healthier. Nationally, about a quarter of Americans have a gym membership. So he sees this as a path towards incentivizing that.\n\nChris Quinn (07:26.822)\n\nI guess this would be controversial, but it’s a little surprising that the tax deduction wouldn’t go with proving the actually use it. It’s one thing to buy it. It’s another thing to go to the gym. And I would be all in favor of a use deduction. If you really did get people into the gym and working out, that would make a difference. But a lot of people get gym memberships and never use them. It’s the January 1st New Year’s resolution debacle. All the gyms.\n\nLisa (07:34.435)\n\nExactly. Exactly.\n\nLisa (07:49.155)\n\nnever use them.\n\nChris Quinn (07:55.582)\n\nclubs get lots of members who don’t show up. So I’m not sure this would actually do what he wants it to do.\n\nCourtney (08:02.092)\n\nYou know, there are some other question marks about how this proposal would work. still in its early stages. So it makes sense. There’s those question marks out there, but right now we don’t know how much this would end up being a drain on state coffers. Right. And we also heard from some democratic lawmakers, including state Senator Bill Demora. He’s from the Columbus area, kind of like you, Chris, he’s supportive of the big idea here, which is to get Ohioans healthier, but he\n\ndoesn’t really know about the numbers. He said, you know, several rec centers in his district are about 20 bucks a month. Gyms run up to 50 bucks a month. So his thought there was whether the bill might incentivize gyms to raise rates. We’ll have to see. But then we heard from another Democratic lawmaker who noted how most people use the standardized deduction. Regular everyday people aren’t really using that itemized deduction, which is what this would apply to. So how helpful is it?\n\nLisa (08:49.809)\n\npeople use the standardized seduction. Regular everyday people aren’t really using that itemizer.\n\nChris Quinn (08:59.912)\n\nWell, that’s true. I mean, that it probably would not affect it. I didn’t see in there that I would get to deduct my forty five dollar a month Peloton membership, which is the same as belonging to a gym. It seems like this was for facility fees. You are listening to Today in Ohio. Remember when license plates were made by inmates in prisons? How is Ohio looking to privatize themed license plates? And how exactly would that work?\n\nFor instance, Lisa, could we have a Today in Ohio license plate?\n\nLisa (09:30.715)\n\nGosh, if we did, I don’t know if I’d want one. They might be shooting me in the streets up here in Trump country, but no, there’s a proposal in the $11.5 billion transportation budget to outsource the making of specialty license plates to a private company. So there is a company in Texas.\n\nChris Quinn (09:33.161)\n\nLisa (09:48.443)\n\nThey’re the only state that’s using the private sector to make specialty plates. They’ve been doing that since 2009 and it resulted in $200 million and more into their general revenue fund. But there were a lot of complaints from customers about escalating prices. So how it would work is this company, whatever company it might be, they would take over the doing of these plates. We currently have about 300 specialty plates in Ohio, but with a private company there could be more.\n\nAlthough all plate designs have to be approved by the Ohio Controlling Board. So like no Nazis or swastikas, we hope. This was similar to legislation passed in Ohio last year, but it died in the Senate committee. So it’ll be interesting to see that there will be fees. It’ll be more expensive than it is now, our specialty plates are already more expensive. They’d have to pay two fees to be determined.\n\nThe proceeds would go to the company and then other proceeds would go to local grants for drug task forces of all things.\n\nChris Quinn (10:52.276)\n\nIt’s an interesting idea. think a lot of special interests would love to have a themed license plate, but it’s kind of onerous to do that. Now, if this eased it up and you could have lots of different logos on Ohio license plates, could make it more interesting driving along the turnpike. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. Ohio lawmakers have been busy gutting the marijuana legalization law that voters overwhelmingly approved.\n\nbut they are ignoring the ease that people, including minors, have in buying some hemp products known as Delta 8. Lisa, is that finally changing?\n\nLisa (11:28.657)\n\nYeah, they’re trying to get this, you know, out of the gas stations and convenience stores. So there’s Senate Bill 86. It will require most products with 0.3 % or more of THC be sold only in dispensaries with some very narrow exceptions like for beverages. So Delta-8 is derived from hemp, which is not supposed to be intoxicating. It’s being sold all over, pretty much unregulated. It’s less potent than Delta-9, but Delta-8 still gives you a high.\n\nAnd there was a loophole in the 2018 federal farm bill that allowed hemp to be cultivated and sold. And this is an attempt to close that loophole, at least in Ohio. So Senator Steve Huffman from Miami County says it should be regulated like marijuana. He did float an outright ban on Delta-8 and age-restricted sales, but he decided just moving it to dispensaries would be better after talking with his cousin Matt and Governor Mike DeWine.\n\nThere’s a guy in Cleveland, owns the dispensary tribal balance, Robert Berg. He says, well, my older customers would be reluctant to go into a dispensary. And he thinks the bill would block him from selling about half of his hemp products.\n\nChris Quinn (12:39.796)\n\nYeah, but this is an outlier that should have been closed. I don’t know why it’s taken so long. Mike DeWine started championing closing this loophole a long while ago, and the lawmakers have just vacillated on it. And there is evidence that kids are getting it. Gas stations are not going to operate with the same care that the dispensaries are because they don’t want to lose their license.\n\nLisa (12:41.115)\n\nThat’s a head-scratcher to me.\n\nLisa (13:01.543)\n\nChris Quinn (13:05.076)\n\nI’m surprised at how long it’s taken. You start to wonder whether the Delta 8 people are buying off legislators and that’s why it’s taken so long to get here. Mike DeWine, when he met with us, what was it, two years ago, he had the products. He said, we bought this at a gas station this morning. This is basically pot. And yet here we are, it’s still available. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. We talked yesterday about the large number of\n\nLisa (13:17.137)\n\nMm-hmm. Mm-hmm.\n\nChris Quinn (13:32.116)\n\nfree breakfasts and lunches that schools are providing these days, but there’s a move to provide even more, courtesy of the taxpayers, of course. Laura, what is it?\n\nLaura (13:42.498)\n\nThis is a coalition called Hunger Free Schools Ohio and they want $300 million a year to pay for breakfast and lunch for students in public, private and charter schools that participate in the school lunch and breakfast programs. So this is a big group that began organizing two years ago during the last budget cycle. They wanted to better fund these breakfast and lunches with the idea that kids can’t learn if they are hungry. They can’t concentrate. They can’t\n\ntake their time, they can’t do their homework, they’re just going to be worried about their stomachs. So it’s the Ohio Children’s Hospital Association, Kroger Company, CVS, and a whole bunch of others that want to end childhood hunger. So if the legislature bulks at this price tag, they will say, okay, just breakfast is okay universally. That’s about $50 million a year. And there is a bill in the Ohio Senate, it’s bipartisan, to provide those universal free meals that cost that $300 million.\n\nIts sponsor is Senator Lewis Bill Blessing. He’s from Cincinnati and he’s a Republican. And he’s saying when considering the billions in the state budget, the meal cost really isn’t all that much in the grand scheme of things. I would say, yeah, definitely not when you’ve put a billion dollars toward private schools already.\n\nChris Quinn (14:53.502)\n\nAlthough million is a lot of money. That’s a lot of money. And is it needed? It sounds like the kids who need the meals are getting them already. We don’t have an example of kids in need who don’t get the meals. So what is the purpose of this?\n\nLaura (15:10.52)\n\nWell, you can get free meals if your school is part of this program, if you meet the eligibility and that’s families with incomes at or below the federal poverty level, which is $32,000 for a family of four. There are kids whose families are struggling who don’t meet that threshold and they could be hungry. I mean, we know that the food bank is seeing higher demand than they’ve ever seen before. And during the pandemic, a lot of these schools\n\nbecause they had a big enough population that qualified for free or reduced lunch, all of the kids were getting free breakfast and free lunches. I mean, I’m in a school district where they didn’t they don’t even have a cafeteria in the primary and the intermediate schools. So that was not an option. But if you are having problems getting food at home, I mean, at least we can feed the kids. I feel awful for any kid who’s going hungry during a school day. And I do know that there are schools that send kids home with backpacks full of food for the weekend because that’s two full days.\n\nwhere they don’t get a lunch or a breakfast at school and they’ve got to eat.\n\nChris Quinn (16:13.748)\n\nOkay, you’re listening to Today in Ohio. When Cuyahoga County voters reformed the government a dozen years ago, they created a conflict between the new county law department, which received its powers from the charter, and the county prosecutor, whose powers come from the state constitution. That conflict was resolved amicably with the agreement between the county executive and the prosecutor’s office. Courtney, is that all about the change?\n\nCourtney (16:41.086)\n\nYeah, well, it could. And we’re seeing this tug of war that kind of felt like it had long been settled. Get started up again by the current prosecutor, Mike O’Malley. So he reached out to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, seeking essentially full control of these legal powers that had in the past until now been kind of divvied up between the law department, which falls under the county executive,\n\nAnd O’Malley’s office, O’Malley’s directly elected by the people. And what we’re seeing now is O’Malley seeking to upend that division of labor. And he wants Yoast to sign off on that. O’Malley basically told us, and he said in his letter to Yoast that the division of labor as it stands today runs contrary to Ohio law and the charter. He said that division of labor does not serve the best interests of county residents.\n\nAnd he said that quote issues in recent years have made that apparent to him. Now, part of the problem here is O’Malley isn’t saying what these issues are. So we don’t know why he’s seeking to obtain more power back to his office. That’d be really helpful to know going into this debate. But where we are now is the prosecutor’s office has its civil division and it handles, you know, things like\n\nCounty agencies, criminal matters. The law department represents the executive and council and handles labor negotiations and things like that. When O’Malley came aboard back in 2017, he signed off on kind of this division of labor as it stands today. Prior to him, they were back in force with former prosecutors McGinty and Mason, but that’s how it’s really been operating since about 2017.\n\nChris Quinn (18:34.856)\n\nThis has been brewing in the background for a long, long time, though. There was a fear that if the prosecutor pushed too hard, there’d be an effort to change the law more dramatically to seal this separation. But the Constitution does say the prosecutor is the county’s lawyer. So I’ve never quite understood how this came up in the first place. And I think it’s only because\n\nthe prosecutor’s office in the early days was in favor of the new government existing and agreed to cede its authority. But now that we have a prosecutor that’s saying, I get my power from the Constitution and I don’t think this is appropriate. I can’t wait to see how Dave Yost rules on this because it seems like that O’Malley would win, that he would be the county’s lawyer and the law department would have a lesser role. Of course, Chris Ronane and\n\nDale Miller, the county council president, are dead set against this. They want to keep it the way it is.\n\nCourtney (19:36.256)\n\nYeah, I’m just I’m scratching my head at why does O’Malley want this power? He won’t tell us what is going on there.\n\nChris Quinn (19:44.562)\n\nWell, he has complained in the past about trying to defend the county on civil lawsuits at the jail when the law department is handling other parts of it. There have been conflicts that have come up. I think he’s also, I think if you look at the salaries of the people in the county law department and the salaries of the people in O’Malley’s Law Department.\n\nthere’s a disparity that he resents mightily.\n\nCourtney (20:15.554)\n\nMoney fight. Okay.\n\nChris Quinn (20:17.276)\n\nYeah, you’re listening to Today in Ohio. We heard from the Cleveland mayor, the Cuyahoga County executive, the owners of the Browns and plenty of taxpayers about a proposal to build a covered football stadium in Brook Park. Rich Hexner sat down to hear from the Brook Park mayor. Laura, what does he say about the proposal?\n\nLaura (20:37.986)\n\nHe’s optimistic, but he wants to vet it first. He won’t sign off unless he’s sure that the numbers work in the suburbs favor and that they are not going to be on the hook for all sorts of costs. So that means that checking all those financial projections, making sure that they seem reasonable and that if they don’t meet them, that the city is not going to be on the hook. And it wants to know how much they’re going to gain economically from there. What happens if there’s a strike with the players? What happens if there’s a pandemic and they can’t play?\n\nSo we’re talking about that $2.4 billion covered stadium plan on 176 acres on the former Ford Motor Company property. And the Browns plan calls for the city of Brook Park to borrow $422 million. And then they would raise the city’s admission tax from 3.5 % to 6.5 % and create an 8 % city parking tax and use the income tax dollars generated at the site to pay for that. But apparently,\n\nThe original plan was looking at 300 million. So this is more than Brooke Park thought they’d be shouldering. the mayor, Edward Orquette, really wants to make sure that his suburb is not getting taken advantage of.\n\nChris Quinn (21:46.984)\n\nI don’t think Brook Park would borrow it. think the county would borrow it, but it’s the Brook Park taxes that would pay for it. And it is vacuuming up a bunch of taxes, including new ones, that would all go into this stadium. And I think that’s what his concern is about. It is troubling that a suburb this tiny is entering a deal with a project this\n\nLaura (21:51.081)\n\nChris Quinn (22:11.87)\n\nhuge. Usually these kinds of projects are done by big cities that have all sorts of resources to deal with them. Brook Park, how many people live there? Is it 18,000 or something? Yeah, and they would have this massive project in their midst that they’re kind of on the hook for. So I was glad to see he’s wary of it. The Browns have laid out a proposal they believe provides way more money than is necessary to get done what they want to do.\n\nLaura (22:12.515)\n\nLaura (22:21.742)\n\n18,063 in 7.5 square miles.\n\nChris Quinn (22:41.46)\n\nand we’re still waiting to see what’s gonna happen with the state. But it was a great idea by Rich to just sit down and chat with the Brook Park mayor to get his full thoughts about what might be coming to his backyard. It does sound like he’s very much in favor of getting it.\n\nLaura (22:56.386)\n\nYeah, you’re right. This is a small town and on game days it would be five times its regular size. And while the Browns say they’d be responsible for police and fire service on the site and in the parking lots, the city would have to cover police and services outside the site and they’d have to be able to cover that. And think about all the roads, all of the wear and tear on the roads going in and if they’d have to widen anything to get into there or you just don’t understand.\n\njust from planning how it’s all going to shake out and where the impacts are going to be felt.\n\nChris Quinn (23:31.732)\n\nAll right, you’re listening to Today in Ohio. Cleveland’s grand lakefront plans will cost a good bit of cash and City Council voted Tuesday to create a potential source for some of it. Courtney, how would it work?\n\nCourtney (23:45.034)\n\nYeah, this new thing that council signed off on is called a new community authority or an NCA. It exists in Ohio law as a way to levy specific tax like fees on items in a specific geographical area. Without an NCA, cities don’t have the authority to just tax businesses in a particular neighborhood or on a particular street, for example. And with the lakefront, Mayor Bibb wants\n\nto use money generated by the lakefront to pay for improvements to the lakefront. So this NCA is targeted just at right now as a handful of businesses and amenities down there, but users of those amenities would have to pay additional fees on things like parking, retail purchases, food receipts, and the like. And then those additional fees, which are on top of the regular taxes that are levied for such items,\n\nthen that money from those fees would feed into the NCA. And what Bib and his team want to do is reinvest that money back into the lakefront.\n\nChris Quinn (24:52.774)\n\nI it’s novel, right? It’s a it’s something that you could see generating cash, but it does raise questions about putting more costs on the people that want to come downtown. The Rock Hall is one of the places they’re talking about putting in here. It’s already what? Twenty nine thirty dollars to buy a single ticket for that place. You already have to pay for parking there. And now you add to that. Do you make it to the point where it’s just I’m not paying that kind of money?\n\nto go look at some Michael Jackson’s Jackson costumes. I it’s just, I wonder at what point you hit the resistance because there’s plenty of things to do in Northeast Ohio that do not carry those fees.\n\nCourtney (25:34.86)\n\nYou know, the argument from folks who back this is that these fees are negotiated. They’re not going to be, you know, huge, huge. There, there is a cap on them and these fees will be negotiated between this authority and occupants like the rock hall, like the Great Lake science center. So it’s not like these are going to be huge fees. The rock hall isn’t going to say, yeah, make our users pay 20 bucks more. For example, they’re going to be measuring it so they don’t.\n\nhopefully mess up that demand for their amenities. But we did see some pushback on this idea from at least a couple members of council. So everyone was largely on board except for Councilman Mike Polenski and Brian Casey. They both voted against the ordinance and I think Polenski brings up a good point here. He had concerns about whether Cleveland’s lakefront development plans would actually move forward, especially with the Browns saying they’re not going to be there anymore.\n\nNow, the lakefront head guy, Scott Skinner, he said, no, like we are redoing the lakefront no matter what. But I think there is some question mark here about where does the lakefront go from here? Okay, yeah, the Browns are out of the equation, but Cleveland is potentially losing like over $100 million in federal grants that they were really relying on to do these plans. So you may be playing around the edges with some of this change.\n\nfrom the fees, if you don’t have that main pot of money to share the lakefront along, how does BIB intend to revitalize the lakefront without all those federal funds?\n\nChris Quinn (27:11.666)\n\nI just get back to how we started the podcast talking about inflation and all the money coming out of people’s pockets. And I think you were still covering City Hall when Bibb and company changed the whole parking fee structure and basically raised parking rates all over downtown. At some point you hit a ceiling on how much you can take from people to partake of your attractions. And you start to kind of kill that golden goose.\n\nCreating another method to take money out of people’s pockets should get a close scrutiny. And I do think Polancic’s right. There are so many questions now about the lakefront. Plus, they’re never gonna close Burke. I they all talk like they wanna close Burke, but they’re all too gutless to close Burke, which would give you an enormous piece of lakefront to develop. So, a lot of questions on this one. I’m not sure they did the right thing. You’re listening to Today in Ohio.\n\nKing James, a show about LeBron James and Cleveland fans has been staged all over the place, but not in the city that inspired it. It’s finally coming. Lisa, where and what is it about?\n\nLisa (28:19.904)\n\nYeah, it’s coming home this Friday at the Outcult Theater in Playhouse Square, and it’s going to run through March 23rd. As you said, King James by playwright Rajiv Joseph, who is a Cleveland Heights native and a lifelong Cavaliers fan, premiered in Chicago in 2022, and then it went on to Los Angeles. It went to New York, off Broadway and other cities. But yes, the first time in Cleveland where it’s set. So this is a four act play. takes\n\nplace in a Cleveland Heights bar there are two characters. So the first scene is 2004 that was LeBron’s rookie season and the characters include the bartender Matt and then a writer Sean who comes into the bar and each of the four scenes reflects milestones in their lives and LeBron’s career. So one is called The Decision, one is called The Return and one is called The Championship. So it looks like a really cool play.\n\nJoseph is familiar with, he wrote the screenplay for the 2014 film Draft Day, which featured the Browns. think Kevin Costner was in that movie as well. yeah, coming to you this Friday.\n\nChris Quinn (29:25.616)\n\nIt’s just odd that it hasn’t played here because we are Cleveland. It’s all about here. And it started in Chicago, but it’s been everywhere. And finally, people get to see it here. I hope it packs them in. Everybody loves to talk about LeBron James. You’re listening to Today in Ohio. That’s it for the Wednesday episode. Thanks, Courtney. Thanks, Lisa. Thanks, Laura. Thank you for listening.

The Post has sought comment from Lewis.\n\n“I don’t comment on private meetings or conversations, not that they’re a matter of deep interest to many people,” Johnson told The Post.\n\nNews of the meeting coincided with MSNBC’s announcement that Jackie Alemany, who covered politics at the Washington Post, was coming onboard as co-host of one of its “The Weekend” panel shows.\n\nAlemany will co-host the show alongside another Washington Post personality, Jonathan Capehart, and Eugene Daniels, the White House correspondent for Politico.\n\n“Jackie has built a reputation of accountability journalism covering the nation’s capital from both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue,” Rebecca Kutler, MSNBC’s president, said in a statement. \n\n“Her addition as a co-host of ‘The Weekend’ in the mornings, alongside Eugene Daniels and Jonathan Capehart, solidifies this trio as a trusted roundtable of experts and insiders our audience is looking forward to waking up with every Saturday and Sunday.”\n\nAlemany is the latest Washington Post journalist to leave the paper in the wake of management’s overhaul of its editorial and opinions pages.\n\nSince the start of the year, several WaPo staffers have departed, including Ben Terris, Leigh Ann Caldwell, Tony Romm, Isaac Stanley-Becker and Cristiano Lima-Strong, according to Status.\n\nStaffers who spoke to Status describe a newsroom that has been beset by low morale in the wake of leadership’s decisions.\n\n“I’ve worked in messy newsrooms and even when I fled those, I still thought I could confidently tell someone why they should or should not work there, depending on their career goals and values,” one former Washington Post employee told Status.\n\n“I can make no such case about The Post anymore.”\n\nBezos, who purchased the Washington Post from the Graham family in 2013 for $250 million in cash, announced last week that the newspaper’s opinions section would be devoted to advocating for “personal liberties” and “free markets.”\n\nDavid Shipley, the newspaper’s opinion editor, resigned.

When he was elected, he would get revenge.\n\n\"I am your retribution,\" Trump said to crowds of his supporters throughout the campaign.\n\nThis was not an abstraction. He had a few targets in mind.\n\n\"I will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America, Joe Biden, and the entire Biden crime family,\" he said in 2023.\n\nThere were also the judges, prosecutors and politicians who tried to hold Trump accountable for his crimes, both the ones for which he was indicted and the ones for which he was convicted. He refused to rule out an effort to prosecute Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney who prosecuted the Stormy Daniels hush-money case against him, and attacked Justice Juan Merchan, who presided over the trial, as \"crooked.\" Trump shared an image that called for Liz Cheney, a former Republican representative and Jan. 6 committee member, to be prosecuted in \"televised military tribunals,\" and he accused Gen. Mark Milley, a former chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, of treason, calling his actions \"so egregious that, in times gone by, the punishment would have been DEATH!\"\n\nTo get his revenge, Trump would turn the IRS, the FBI and other powerful parts of the federal government against his political enemies. He would hound and harass them in retaliation for their opposition to his law stretching and lawbreaking.\n\nFor once in his public career, Trump wasn't lying. As president, he has made it a priority to go after his political enemies.\n\nOne of his first acts once he was back in office was to remove security protections from former officials facing credible death threats, including his former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his former national security adviser John Bolton, both of whom Trump views as disloyal. Not only did he take away their protection, knowing they were under threat from Iran, but he also publicly discussed that he had removed their security, as if to entice their antagonists.\n\nTrump fired more than a dozen government inspectors general at various federal agencies -- most likely in retaliation for the fact that it was an inspector general who informed Congress about Trump's attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate Biden. Trump has also tried to purge the Justice Department of any lawyers and officials who worked on the Jan. 6 investigation or helped to prosecute the Jan. 6 rioters (nearly all of whom, of course, he pardoned or released).\n\nTrump has also placed a supplicant, Kash Patel, at the head of the FBI. A fervent Trump loyalist, Patel has promised to \"go out and find the conspirators\" who undermined Trump in office. Patel even published an enemies list of people he hoped to pursue and prosecute in a second Trump term, with names ranging from Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Kamala Harris to former Trump allies like Bill Barr and Cassidy Hutchinson. Now that Patel is ensconced at the FBI, we should expect him to wield his new powers against the president's foes, whether in government or outside it.\n\nYou can even understand Trump's deep hostility toward Ukraine and its president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as part of his effort to punish anyone who undermines his attempt to gather and wield power. It is noteworthy that after his disastrous Oval Office confrontation with the Ukrainian president, Trump voiced his sympathy for the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, in a novel and revealing way. \"Let me tell you: Putin went through a hell of a lot with me,\" Trump said. \"He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia.\" He seems to identify so closely with Putin that he sees any scrutiny of the Russian dictator as an attack on him as well.\n\nAltogether, Trump has done more to actualize his desire for retribution than he has to fulfill his campaign promise to lower the price of groceries or reduce the cost of housing. A telling sign, perhaps, of his real priorities in office.\n\nThis fact of Trump's indifference to most Americans -- if not his outright hostility toward them, considering his assault on virtually every government function that helps ordinary people -- suggests another dimension to his revenge tour. It is almost as if he wants to inflict pain not just on a specific set of individuals but on the entire nation.\n\n(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nHere, it is worth taking a minute to talk about the psychology of Donald Trump.\n\nSome of our presidents have been complicated men. Consider Richard Nixon, a nearly Shakespearean figure of great talent and ambition whose paranoia, personal demons and lust for power proved to be his downfall.\n\nTrump, by comparison, is not a complicated man.\n\nHis every executive function exists to satisfy his ego. He is a covetous person consumed by an insatiable desire for acquisition, a man who seems to take the seven deadly sins as a seven-day challenge. He sees every relationship as a game of dominance and seems to reject the very idea of a mutually beneficial transaction. He treats everyone around him, from employees and political allies to members of his own family, as tools to use and then discard. To cozy up to Trump is to sacrifice your dignity to his cravings and desires.\n\nUnderstand these basic traits about Trump -- and there is not much more to understand -- and you can all but predict his behavior in any given situation. Yes, he is erratic, volatile, capricious and compulsive. But the common conceit that he is unpredictable is belied by the ease with which even a casual observer can plot his movements from A to B.\n\nFor example, Trump will always reject the results and present himself as a winner if he loses a contest. This was clear in 2016 -- he even claimed that Clinton's popular-vote victory was the result of fraud -- and it came to fruition when he lost reelection in 2020, a psychic wound so grievous that the only way he could attend to it was to try to overturn the result.\n\nTrump failed -- and spent the next four years stewing over his defeat. He made \"Stop the steal\" his mantra and organized the entire Republican Party around the delusional claim that he was the legitimate victor in 2020. And while Trump went on to win the 2024 race, even capturing the national popular vote for the first time in his political career, it's not at all clear that his rage and resentment have subsided. It would actually be shocking, given what we know about his behavior and personality, if he could regulate his emotions well enough to turn his anger into something more constructive.\n\nIf this is his psychological state, then it stands to reason that Trump would want revenge against the public that denied him a second term as much as he wants revenge against the officials who have tried to make him answer for his illegal actions.\n\n(END OPTIONAL TRIM.)\n\nIt is hard to describe Trump's first month and a half in office as something other than a retribution campaign against the American people.\n\nUnder the cover of an audit, he has empowered Elon Musk, his de facto co-president, to take an ax to any and every program that helps ordinary Americans. The so-called Department of Government Efficiency has stripped funds or personnel or both from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the National Park Service, the National Weather Service, FEMA, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration, among others. It has degraded the federal government's ability to deliver critical services to tens of millions of Americans and is endangering direct payments to millions more. There is no apparent rhyme or reason to these cuts, only a nihilistic drive to cause as much damage and to make it as irreparable as possible.\n\nOne immediate response to all of this is to say that Trump is operating according to some higher-level political and ideological perspective. And there is a cottage industry of observers who have given themselves the unenviable task of transmuting the president's tics and utterances into something like a calculated strategy -- an intellectually defensible set of doctrines rather than the thoughtless patter of an outer-borough confidence man.\n\nBut this has always strained credulity. To ask anyone, for instance, to treat the president's display of childish pique opposite Zelenskyy in the Oval Office as some return to Teddy Rooseveltian great-power realism -- as opposed to the embarrassing tantrum of a grade-school bully -- is to demand that readers administer a self-lobotomy.\n\nLikewise, it takes willful blindness to Trump's own history of explicit racism to treat his crusade against diversity and integration as an embrace of meritocracy (please ignore the people he has chosen to lead the government) rather than a function of the same bigotries that drove him to attack Barack Obama as illegitimate and unfit to be president.\n\nThere is no evidence that Trump is a figure of deep thought or serious insight. There is no evidence that Trump is anything other than what he's been for his entire time in the public eye: an ego-driven creature of boundless envy and vicious, overlapping resentments. Those resentments have led him on a grand tour of retribution against the public.\n\nAnd his envy?\n\nWell, if Trump wants anything, it is the untrammeled authority of the world's autocrats. He wants to be a Putin or a Viktor Orban or a Kim Jong Un. He wants to rule with unchecked power. And if his psychology tells us anything, he will do everything he can to make that a reality, American democracy be damned.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"Donald Trump rambled, ranted and raved his way through the 2024 presidential campaign, but he was clear on one point.

He backs President Donald Trump and Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiative. \n\n“We're no better because we're veterans,” Watson said. \n\n“We all need to take a step back and realize that everybody’s gonna have to take a little bit on the chin to get these budget matters under control.”\n\nBut Gregg Bafundo, a 53-year-old Gulf War veteran residing in Tonasket, Washington, worries about the impact of potential cuts. \n\nBafundo, who suffers from nerve damage due to his service as a Marine mortarman, anticipates needing VA care after losing his job as a wilderness ranger and firefighter due to U.S. Forest Service layoffs. \n\n“They’re going to put guys like me and my fellow Marines that rely on the VA in the ground,” he said.\n\nOver 9 million veterans rely on the VA for physical and mental health care, a department currently under scrutiny by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nWith a budget exceeding $350 billion, the VA manages nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals, many located in Republican-led states and districts. Veterans have publicly voiced their opposition to the proposed cuts at town hall meetings, and organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars are actively mobilizing against the measures.\n\nVeterans were much likelier to support Trump, a Republican, than Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in November’s presidential election, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states. Nearly six in 10 voters who are veterans backed Trump, while about four in 10 voted for Harris.\n\nJoy Ilem, national legislative director for the nonpartisan group Disabled American Veterans, said her group was studying how the ongoing cuts might affect care.\n\n\"You could lose trust among the veteran population over some of these things that have happened and the way that they’ve happened,” Ilem warned. \n\n“And we do fear damage to the recruitment and retention of hiring the best and brightest to serve veterans.”\n\nThe White House's proposed $2 billion cut to VA contracts has sparked concern over potential disruptions to crucial healthcare services, ranging from cancer care to toxic exposure assessments. The cuts were swiftly paused by the VA following an outcry over the potential impact on veterans.\n\nThe move came as over 1,000 short-term VA employees – reportedly including researchers focused on critical health issues like cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics, and burn pit exposure – were dismissed in February.\n\nVA Secretary Doug Collins, in an interview with Fox News Channel, said that the cost-cutting efforts aimed to identify \"deficiencies\" within the system. He said that any actions taken would not compromise veterans' healthcare or earned benefits.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz reiterated the agency's commitment to prioritizing veterans' needs in all its operations. \n\nThe proposed cuts and recent dismissals, however, raise questions about how this commitment will be upheld in practice.\n\n“Every dollar we spend on wasteful contracts, non-mission-critical or duplicative activities is one less dollar we can spend on Veterans, and given that choice, we will always side with the Veteran,” Kasperowicz wrote. \n\nRepublicans have pointed out that the VA has rehired employees who were let go during an initial round of layoffs in February, such as those working for a crisis hotline. However, during a subsequent round of layoffs, the VA cut 15 other employees who were in jobs supporting the crisis line, including a trainer for the phone responders, according to congressional staff who are tracking the cuts.\n\nThe VA has been plagued for years by allegations of poor medical care and excessively long wait times. Investigators a decade ago uncovered widespread problems in how VA hospitals were scheduling appointments after allegations that as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting care at the department's Phoenix hospital. A group of employees accused the department of retaliating against potential whistleblowers. \n\nPresident Barack Obama, a Democrat, eventually put into place a program allowing veterans to go outside the VA system to seek medical care. The Choice Program was extended by Trump during his first term.\n\nRichard Lamb, who was shot down twice in Vietnam as an Army helicopter crew chief, said the department should be “cut to the bone.” \n\nLamb, 74, said he broke vertebrae each time his helicopter was shot down. Decades passed, he said, before a private doctor – not the VA – found compression fractures and performed surgery. \n\n“I’d be happy to see VA, not torn down, but cleaned up, cleaned out and recast,” said Lamb, who lives in Waco, Texas. “The VA is supposed to be a wonderful thing for veterans. It’s not. It sucks.”\n\nDaniel Ragsdale Combs, a Navy veteran with a traumatic brain injury, strongly disagrees. \n\nRagsdale Combs, 45, suffered his injury while running to respond to an order on an aircraft carrier and striking his head above a hatchway. He receives group therapy for mental illness brought on by the injury but says he had heard those sessions might be canceled or reduced due to staffing shortages. \n\n“I’m deeply concerned because the VA has been nothing but great to me,” said Ragsdale Combs, who lives in Mesa, Arizona. “I’m angry, upset and frustrated.”\n\nLucy Wong relies on a team of VA doctors in the Phoenix area to treat her scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that attacks connective tissue. She said she developed the disease as a medical technician in the Navy in the 1980s, working with toxic chemicals and enduring extreme stress. \n\nDriving is difficult. She worries that the VA will cut Uber rides to her medical appointments, among other things. \n\n“I ask if Trump is cutting anything back here, and the reply is, ‘Not yet,’\" Wong said. \n\nJosh Ghering, a former Marine from Parsons, Kansas, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he had to fly to San Antonio for an appointment with a neurologist before he was medically retired for back issues, including herniated discs. He questioned why he could not get the same appointment closer to home.\n\n“I think they’re headed in the right direction,” Ghering, 42, said of DOGE. “But they’re going to have to be more thorough with what it is they’re doing, to make sure they’re not cutting jobs that are needed.”\n\nThe nation’s service members have never been a political monolith, and the same holds true for their views on the VA. But the split between two Marines on opposite sides of the country raises a question not just about DOGE but about America's military: Who is expected to sacrifice?\n\nWatson, the former Marine in Georgia, sustained various injuries while serving, including a traumatic brain injury when a cable snapped and a crate fell on him. He said he's willing to accept fewer visits to his VA doctor and forgo other conveniences as a matter of service to the country.\n\n“Many veterans who voted for Trump understood this was going to be his policy and are now screaming bloody murder because the axe is going to fall upon the VA,” Watson said. “And to me, that’s just a little bit self-centered.”\n\nBafundo, the Marine in Washington state, pushed back against the idea that all Americans are making a sacrifice when, as he sees it, it's really falling back \"on the little guy.” \n\nAmerica’s billionaires won’t be shouldering any of the burden, he argued, while Musk, who's the world's richest person, and others pay little, if any, taxes.\n\n“If we’re going to sacrifice, the wealthy need to sacrifice, too,” he said. “And, frankly, they don’t.”","summary":"Some veterans fear losing services, but others say the VA should be ‘cleaned out’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-doge-veterans-affairs-cuts-b2709523.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/05/12/Trump_DOGE_Veterans_Affairs_12861.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 15:39:01","author":"Ben Finley","authors":["Ben Finley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.042},{"id":297005568,"title":"Movie director swears off directing Bond film after Amazon deal","text":"James Bond’s acquisition by Amazon has turned off one filmmaker, who has sworn off ever directing a 007 film if Jeff Bezos is in charge.\n\nLast month, it was revealed that Amazon MGM has taken full creative control of the Bond franchise after striking a deal with long-time producers Michael G Wilson and Barbara Broccoli.\n\nWhile the pair will remain co-owners of the franchise, the transaction leaves creative control of all future productions in the hands of Amazon.\n\nAmerican filmmaker Osgood Perkins, who directed 2024 sleeper horror hit Longlegsand new film The Monkey, was recently asked during a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” whether he’d ever consider directing a film in the long-running British spy franchise. \n\nHe made his feelings known about the Amazon development with his blunt reply: “No, because f*** Jeff Bezos.” It’s worth noting that Bond films are often directed by British filmmakers. \n\nThe highly influential Bezos is a controversial figure, having faced accusations of creating tense working conditions at Amazon.\n\nJust last week, Washington Post owner Bezos left many workers enraged after he announced changes to the paper’s opinion content that resulted in a top editor resigning.\n\nJournalists at the publication have expressed concern that Bezos is currying favor with President Donald Trump by softening the Post’s coverage of him, months after he blocked the editorial board’s endorsement of then-vice president Kamala Harris.\n\nThe new Bond deal comes amid mounting speculation over the fate of the British spy franchise after Daniel Craig made his final appearance as Bond in 2021’s No Time To Die almost four years ago.

The Trump speech reiterated a key campaign pledge he made that service employees and hourly workers deserve to keep all of their hard-earned extra income. In January speaking to a crowd in Nevada Trump declared, \"for any worker who relies on tipped income, your tips will be 100% yours,\" Thomson Reuters reported.\n\nHe likewise renewed his vow to abolish the tax on overtime pay. These twin proposals—no tax on tips and no tax on overtime—have become centerpieces of Trump's tax policy agenda as he seeks to portray himself as a champion of blue-collar and service industry workers. However, the bold promises raise significant questions about economic impact, fairness, and feasibility, which experts have quickly scrutinized.\n\nGiven Trump's continued call for no tax on tips and no tax on overtime pay, it's worth analyzing the economic implications of each proposal and who would benefit from each. In this article, let's deep-dive into Trump's no-tax-on-tips proposal (I'll do the same for no-tax-on overtime in a subsequent article).\n\nTrump Speech: No Tax On Tips Proposal And Economic Implications\n\nOverview: Trump’s no tax on tips proposal aims to exempt income earned from customer gratuities (tips) from federal income taxation. Trump argues that tipped workers – such as restaurant servers, bartenders, valets, and bellhops – deserve a break, allowing them to keep more of their take-home pay. Supporters have lauded the idea as a lifeline that will \"deliver financial relief by putting cash back into workers’ pockets, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a non-profit, non-partisan thinktank​. The appeal is understandable in an economy where tipping culture is increasingly pervasive, and many service employees rely on tips to boost low base wages.\n\nPolicy Details: While Trump has offered only broad strokes, the concept is that any tips earned by employees would be excluded from taxable income. During his 2024 campaign, Trump first floated the idea, and even his opponent then, then-Vice President Kamala Harris, expressed support for a version of tax-free tips for service workers​. A narrower approach has already been introduced in Congress: the No Tax on Tips Act, backed by Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) and others would create an above-the-line deduction for tip income, capped at $25,000 per year, limited to occupations that \"traditionally and customarily\" receive tips​, according to Thomson Reuters. That bill also restricts the benefit for highly-paid employees, reflecting concerns about cost and fairness.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nTrump Speech Interruption: Rep. Al Green Removed From Chamber—Amid Dem Protests\n\nToday’s NYT Mini Crossword Clues And Answers For Wednesday, March 5th\n\nSupreme Court Orders Trump To Pay Out $2 Billion In USAID Funds: Here’s Where Trump’s Winning—And Losing—In Court\n\nBy contrast, Trump’s vision appears broader – he has not suggested any income cap or occupational restriction, indicating all tipped income would be tax-free​, according to a Brookings Institution, a left-leaning/centrist think tank, commentary. That sweeping scope goes beyond the GOP platform’s call to exempt tips for millions of restaurant and hospitality workers, essentially extending the tax break to anyone who earns tips in any industry.\n\nWho Benefits At A High Level: On the surface, millions of waitstaff, bartenders, hairdressers, delivery drivers, and other tipped workers would benefit. Indeed, those workers could see a modest bump in take-home pay if their tip income is no longer taxed. However, economists note that the reach of this tax break is quite limited. According to an analysis by the Yale Budget Lab, only about 2.5% of the U.S. workforce is employed in traditionally tipped occupations.\n\nAccording to an analysis by the Yale Budget Lab, only about 2.5% of the U.S. workforce is employed in traditionally tipped occupations.\n\nEven among low-income workers, relatively few earn substantial tip income – just ~5% of workers in the bottom quarter of earnings work in tipped jobs​, according to an analysis by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax think tank. In other words, most low- and middle-income workers would see no benefit from a tip tax exemption.\n\nFurthermore, many tipped workers already have little or no federal income tax liability: an estimated 37% of tipped workers earn so little that they pay no federal income tax under current law (due to the standard deduction and credits), according to an analysis by the EPI. ​For those workers, eliminating taxes on tips would not increase their take-home pay because they weren’t paying income tax on those earnings. (Notably, tips would presumably still be subject to payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare unless specifically exempted).\n\nEconomic Implications: Analysts across the political spectrum have raised red flags that no tax on tips is more of a political gesture than sound policy​, notes the Brookings Institution. Similarly, the EPI warns that exempting tips from taxation could \"harm more workers than it helps.” In summary, EPI finds such a policy would help very few workers while undermining pay increases for many more, expand the use of tipped work (a system often rife with instability and abuse), and deplete federal and state budgets while creating new avenues for tax avoidance​.\n\nSimilarly, the EPI warns that exempting tips from taxation could \"harm more workers than it helps.”\n\nOne concern is that making tips tax-free might encourage employers to resist raising base wages – effectively undercutting wage growth for low-paid service workers​. If workers keep more tip income after tax, restaurant and hospitality employers might argue there's less need to increase hourly pay, or lawmakers might feel less pressure to raise the tipped minimum wage. Another concern is a potential explosion in tipping prompts (the so-called \"tipping culture\" ): if tipped income gets special tax treatment, more businesses could adopt tip models to attract workers, meaning consumers may face tip requests in virtually every transaction as firms push more compensation into tax-free tips​. This could widen the practice of tipping beyond restaurants and taxis into retail, services, and other sectors where tipping is not yet standard – a trend some see already, and worry would accelerate.\n\nFiscal Implications: From a fiscal standpoint, the proposal is costly. The Tax Foundation estimates that a complete income tax exemption for tips could reduce federal revenue by roughly $107 billion over 10 years​. That lost revenue would add to deficits or require offsetting cuts or taxes elsewhere. And because the benefit is concentrated on a small workforce segment, many experts argue it's a poorly targeted policy that delivers limited relief while punching a hole in the budget​. The Brookings Institution likewise criticizes the plan as inconsistent with sound tax policy and notes it \"would not even help the vast majority of low-income workers.\" Some low-income tipped employees could inadvertently lose out: if their taxable income drops due to the exclusion of tips, they might receive a smaller Earned Income Tax Credit or other tax benefits pegged to income, reducing their net support​.\n\nTrump Speech: Winners And Losers Of The No Tax On Tips Proposal\n\nMeanwhile, the biggest winners would be those who earn the largest tips – e.g., servers at high-end establishments – rather than the lowest-paid workers. “It makes no sense,\" EPI argues, \"to give preference in the tax code to servers in expensive, high-end restaurants who are receiving large tips over a waitress at Denny's struggling to make ends meet,\" nor to favor tipped workers over equally low-wage non-tipped workers like retail cashiers or teacher's aides​.\n\nThere is also worry that high earners could game the system. For instance, professionals might attempt to reclassify some of their income as tips or funnel compensation through tipping channels to avoid taxes​. While such schemes might be far-fetched, tax experts note that any special exemption can open loopholes. In short, despite its populist appeal, a no-tax-on-tips policy may have more downsides than upsides for workers and the economy.\n\nBeneficiaries: Tipped workers relying on customer gratuities and hourly employees frequently working overtime stand to gain the most. A server, bartender, or taxi driver would no longer owe federal tax on their tips, letting them keep 10-15 % more of those earnings (depending on their tax bracket). The policy is intended to reward frontline service staff and laborers – the \"working class\" that Trump often champions. To the extent those workers see higher net income, they could have more disposable spending money, which might provide a modest boost to local economies.\n\nThose Left Out: Conversely, workers who don't receive tips would see no direct benefit and may even be disadvantaged relatively. A retail cashier or warehouse worker who never gets tips wouldn't gain anything from the tip tax cut. These workers might feel overlooked as their tipped, overtime-earning peers get a new tax perk. There's also the possibility that some low-income workers could lose access to certain tax credits. For instance, if a portion of their income is no longer counted as taxable, they might qualify for a smaller Earned Income Tax Credit, effectively offsetting some of the benefits of the tax exclusion.\n\nAdditionally, the biggest winners under the tip proposal would be the higher earners within the tipped workforce – e.g., servers at upscale restaurants or luxury hotel staff who receive large tips. Those in more modest establishments with smaller tips (or those who pool tips) would gain less in absolute terms. This raises questions of fairness: the policy doesn’t distinguish between a bartender making $60,000 a year in tips at a high-end lounge and another making $15,000 in tips at a diner. In essence, many workers outside the specific tip-earning and overtime categories would see no new relief, and some could perceive the measures as inequitable.\n\nTrump Speech: Unintended Consequences Of The No Tax On Tips Proposal\n\nUnintended Consequences: The proposal may create perverse incentives and loopholes that policymakers must watch. In the case of tips, one unintended outcome could be the proliferation of tipping across the economy. If tips become tax-free income, employers might increasingly adopt tip models (e.g., adding tip jars or tip options in businesses that historically didn't use them) to attract workers or allow them to earn more without raising wages. Consumers are already noticing touchscreens soliciting tips from take-out orders to ride-shares; a tax exemption could supercharge this trend., according to the EPI.\n\nPotential Tax Avoidance Schemes: individuals with high incomes might try to reclassify payments as tips to avoid taxes, or employers could funnel bonuses through a tip-like mechanism. For example, a consulting firm might attempt to label a client’s payment as a tip to an employee for it to be tax-free – though IRS rules would indeed seek to prevent such abuse. With overtime, the opportunity for avoidance lies in worker classification. Without careful guardrails, what starts as a boon for workers could morph into a broad tax-avoidance channel for clever employers and employees​\n\nEmployer Responses: Employers could also react in ways that blunt the intended benefits. In tipped industries, business owners (especially restaurants) might cite the tax break as a reason to resist wage increases – arguing that servers and staff are already getting a boost via untaxed tips. Some states or cities pushing to raise the tipped minimum wage might face pushback, with opponents saying \"no-tax-on-tips” makes such raises less necessary.\n\nIn sum, while many workers would welcome extra take-home pay, the broader impacts of these tax proposals are complex. Trade-offs in equity, economic behavior, and public finance must be carefully weighed.\nForbesTrump’s No Tax On Tips And No Tax On Overtime Policies Could Hinge On ThisBy Shahar Ziv\n\nTrump Speech: No Tax On Tips Proposal Political And Legislative Landscape\n\nThe Trump speech renewed call for no taxes on tips or overtime comes as Republicans in Congress grapple with turning these campaign promises into reality. In late February, the House of Representatives (with a GOP majority) passed a sweeping budget resolution that embraced Trump's tax-cut agenda – including the tip and overtime tax exemptions – alongside deep spending cuts. However, it's important to note that a budget resolution is non-binding and essentially a political blueprint. The real test is translating these ideas into legislation that can pass the House and Senate and be signed into law.\n\nAt present, the political pathway for these proposals is uncertain. Speaker Mike Johnson has indicated that House Republicans aim to include the no tax on tips provision in a budget reconciliation package. In theory, reconciliation is a legislative process that could allow these tax changes to pass the Senate with a simple majority (avoiding a filibuster) – a crucial consideration given the Senate’s narrow divide. However, there’s a major caveat: under reconciliation rules and GOP leadership’s own stance, any tax cuts would need to be paid for such that the overall package reduces the deficit​.\n\nRecognizing the challenge, Senate Republicans have proposed a workaround: switching to a \"current policy\" baseline. Under this approach, the budget would assume that existing tax policies—including the 2017 Trump tax cuts—are permanent. Extending them wouldn’t count as new spending, effectively erasing their projected cost on paper. However, there is no determination yet as to whether the parlimentarian would approve of this change and whether fiscal conservatives would go along with it.\n\nThere are possible compromises that could be implementing caps or phase-outs (for instance, only making a certain amount of overtime or tip income tax-free or limiting it to lower-income workers) to reduce the fiscal cost and address fairness issues.\n\nTrump Speech: No Tax On Tips Conclusion\n\nIn the Trump speech, his call to nix taxes on tips and overtime pay has energized parts of his base and spotlighted the income of waitstaff, bartenders, servers, factory workers, and many others who often feel overlooked in tax policy debates. These proposals tap into broader conversations about America's tipping culture, fair wages, and how the tax code can or should boost working-class incomes. They offer a simplistic promise of more money in workers' pockets, which is certainly attractive in an era of squeezed household budgets.\n\nYet, as the analysis shows, the reality is more complicated than what the Trump speech alludes. The benefits would be uneven, the potential for unintended economic side-effects is real, and the fiscal trade-offs are significant. As lawmakers consider Trump's tax policy changes, they must weigh the tangible gains for certain workers against the broader consequences for the tax system and economy. In mirroring Trump's pitch, one thing is clear: the debate over \"no tax on tips\" and \"no tax on overtime\" is about much more than taxes – it's about what we value in the workforce and how far we're willing to go to support those who keep the country running, one tip and one extra hour at a time.\n\nFollow me on Twitter or LinkedIn.

The Oscar – a first for Palestine – has now been added to the list of 45 awards that the film has won since its release in 2024, including best documentary in the 2024 European Film Awards, the 2024 Berlin International Film Festival, and the 2024 Gotham Awards.\n\nThe feature has received widespread critical acclaim and glowing five-star reviews in international media. It has been screened around the world and has consistently sold out in independent screenings in the United States. And yet, no US distributor would pick it up to show it nationwide. The only reason for that is its subject matter: Palestine.\n\nThe documentary follows the lives of Palestinian communities in Masafer Yatta, an area near Hebron in the southern occupied West Bank, which the Israeli army has declared a “military zone”. Under this pretext, Israeli troops and illegal settlers regularly harass its residents and destroy their houses, rendering them homeless. The story is told through the lens of co-directors Basel Adra, a Palestinian activist, and Yuval Abraham, an Israeli journalist.\n\nThis raw, harrowing depiction of Israel’s ongoing crimes is something distributors are clearly afraid of showing. And this is in a country that prides itself on its constitutionally guaranteed right to free speech.\n\nThe distributors’ fear is a great illustration of just how massive the campaign is to erase Palestine in the US, affecting every aspect of public life – from education to the media, and to arts and cinema.\n\nOf course, anti-Palestinian censorship is nothing new. Since 1948, Palestinian culture and history have continually faced attempted erasure as Israel has tried to justify its land grab, claiming the Palestinian people do not exist and have no right to their own land. This narrative has also dominated public perceptions in Western countries that have supported Israel throughout its existence – foremost among them the United States.\n\nMaintaining this narrative has been key to continuing political support.\n\nIf the American public is exposed to more information about what is happening in Palestine, if Palestinians are humanised in the mainstream, if they are given a platform to tell their stories of experiencing genocide and apartheid, then public opinion would start shifting dramatically.\n\nIt already is. Various polls over the past year showed that Americans, especially Democrats, disagreed with their government’s policies on Israel-Palestine. The majority of Democrats supported a ceasefire in Gaza when President Joe Biden’s administration was refusing to endorse it. This stance ultimately cost Kamala Harris countless votes in the presidential election.\n\nA significant change in public opinion on Israel-Palestine would make it hard for the US Congress to sustain the multibillion-dollar financing of the Israeli military and political support for occupation and apartheid.\n\nThat is why the erasure campaign – spearheaded by Israel itself – against Palestinian voices, stories and history must be maintained.\n\nBut the challenges No Other Land has experienced since its release are not just another clear-cut case of anti-Palestinian censorship.\n\nThe film has shared storytelling between a Palestinian and an Israeli. It is not solely Adra’s voice that is heard in the documentary talking about what is happening in Palestine, but also Abraham’s.\n\nAs the latter acknowledged during his award acceptance speech at the Oscars: “Together, our voices are stronger.” Indeed, if the film was fully Palestinian-made, it would have been labelled as biased and struggled to garner the same level of global attention. Having an Israeli co-director has probably opened some doors, but it also made it more “dangerous”.\n\nIn his speech, Abraham said: “When I look at Basel, I see my brother, but we are unequal. We live in a regime where I am free under civilian law but Basel has to live under military laws that destroy his life and he cannot control. There is a different path. A political solution without ethnic supremacy.”\n\nThe idea of an Israeli such as Abraham expressing opposition to apartheid and occupation is clearly not tolerated. It does not fit the mainstream narrative that Israel is the moral compass and that all Palestinians only wish for the obliteration of all Jews.\n\nThere are many Jewish Americans who share Abraham’s views and have spoken out against Israel. They have not only been branded as “self-hating Jews” by Israel supporters but have also been harassed, censored, accused of anti-Semitism and even arrested during demonstrations.\n\nSuch attacks under the guise of “countering anti-Semitism” and “out of concern for Jewish safety” have actually made many Jewish people unsafe.\n\nAbraham himself was made to feel “unsafe and unwelcome” in Germany – the very country that has made its reason d’etre the protection of Israel and Jewish people – after his award acceptance speech at the Berlin Film Festival last year.\n\nGerman politicians rushed to label his speech “anti-Semitic”, while the website of the city of Berlin described No Other Land as “exhibiting anti-Semitic tendencies”.\n\nLike the US, Germany has only doubled down on support for Israel since the start of its genocidal campaign in Gaza. In this way, both countries, like the rest of Israel’s Western supporters, have become barriers to peace.\n\nAbraham alluded to this very point during his acceptance speech, saying it is US “foreign policy helping block the path” to peace.\n\nDespite all the challenges it has faced, No Other Land has achieved remarkable success. Hoping still to reach a wider audience in the US, the filmmakers have opted to self-distribute across select theatres. To find out where the film is screening, you can visit its website.\n\nNo Other Land is a powerful film that Americans must see. As Adra pointed out in a recent interview for Democracy Now, we hold responsibility. Our tax money is funding the destruction of his community, which has only accelerated in the past year.\n\nA few weeks before the Oscar win, Adra wrote on social media: “Anyone who cared about No Other Land should care about what is actually happening on the ground… Masafer Yatta is disappearing in front of my eyes.”\n\nCourtesy: aljazeera","summary":"Ahmed Twaij On Sunday, the Israeli-Palestinian co-production No Other Land was awarded an Academy Award for best documentary.

He spoke for roughly one hour and 40 minutes.\n\n\"We have accomplished more in 43 days than most administrations accomplish in four years or eight years -- and we are just getting started,\" he said.\n\nDemocrats lodged protests throughout the evening, with one representative getting kicked out and others holding signs in silent opposition. But Trump argued that it was the Democrats who left him a country besieged by crises and that his administration was working to clean them up.\n\nHere are six takeaways from Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress in his second term.\n\nTrump signaled a reset with Ukraine after his explosive meeting with that country's president.\n\nOne day after Trump temporarily suspended the delivery of U.S. military aid to Ukraine, he signaled a willingness to reset the relationship. The president said he appreciated a message from President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine, in which he said his country was \"ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible to bring lasting peace closer.\"\n\nThe new posture comes days after Trump's explosive Oval Office meeting with Zelenskyy, which resulted in the Ukrainian leader hastily departing the White House without signing a deal for the United States to have access to Ukraine's revenue for rare earth minerals. In his message, which was posted on social media Tuesday, Zelenskyy said he was ready to sign the deal, a top priority for Trump.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Trump also said he had had \"serious\" discussions with Russia and they have signaled they also are \"ready for peace.\"\n\n\"It's time to stop this madness,\" he said. \"It's time to halt the killing. It's time to end the senseless war. If you want to end wars, you have to talk to both sides.\"\n\nTrump reiterated his support for tariffs, despite early market turmoil.\n\nTrump widened his trade wars Tuesday when he instituted sweeping tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China. Despite the markets' plunging in response to his actions, Trump said he would not budge, dismissing the reaction as \"a little disturbance.\" He said more tariffs would go into effect April 2.\n\n\"Other countries have used tariffs against us for decades, and now it's our turn to start using them against those other countries,\" he said.\n\nEarlier in the day, Howard Lutnick, the commerce secretary, said Trump could announce a new trade deal with Mexico and Canada as soon as Wednesday. But the president made no mention of that in his speech Tuesday night.\n\n\"Whatever they tariff us, other countries, we will tariff them,\" he said. \"That's reciprocal, back and forth.\"\n\nTrump faced sustained opposition from Democrats throughout a contentious night.\n\nWithin the first few minutes of Trump's speech, Rep. Al Green, D-Texas, stood up and started heckling the president. After Green ignored multiple warnings from House Speaker Mike Johnson, the speaker ordered the sergeant-at-arms to remove Green from the chamber.\n\nGreen's eviction marked the most contentious moment of a combative night, as Democrats organized various protests against the president. Many Democratic lawmakers held up small black signs with phrases that included \"Save Medicaid,\" \"Musk Steals\" and \"False.\" Rep. Rashida Tlaib of Michigan held up a whiteboard that said \"Start by paying your own taxes\" as Trump talked about tax cuts. A number of Democrats, including Reps. Maxwell Frost of Florida and Jasmine Crockett of Texas, walked out during Trump's speech.\n\nBut even as they expressed their dissent, Democrats showed they were still struggling to coalesce around a unified message of opposition to Trump.\n\nTrump stressed his support for Elon Musk's efforts to overhaul government.\n\nMusk, the world's richest man, has overseen the Trump administration's aggressive effort to overhaul the federal government with sweeping cuts to the workforce and contracts. The speed and the scope of Musk's work has caught many in Washington off guard, with Democrats accusing him of violating congressional spending authority and civil service protections.\n\nBut Trump made clear Tuesday that he wholeheartedly supports Musk's radical approach.\n\n\"He's working very hard,\" Trump said of Musk, who nodded and beamed in response. \"He didn't need this. He didn't need this. Thank you very much. We appreciate it.\"\n\nPointing to Democrats, he said: \"Everybody here -- even this side appreciates it, I believe. They just don't want to admit that. Just listen to some of the appalling waste we have already identified.\"\n\nThe president spent several minutes listing off a wide range of programs Musk's team has cut, bragging that the effort had identified \"hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud.\" But even Musk's initiative has claimed to have generated only $105 billion in savings, assertions that have not been verified. The New York Times has found that DOGE has erroneously reported savings based on contracts that had already ended and miscalculated numbers.\n\nTrump also re-upped his attacks on federal workers, vowing to \"reclaim power from this unaccountable bureaucracy.\"\n\n\"Any federal bureaucrat who resists this change will be removed from office immediately,\" he said.\n\nTrump spent little time discussing new policies.\n\nPresidents often use addresses to a joint session of Congress to lay out their agenda for the year ahead. But not Trump. He did not unveil new policies and devoted little time to the wars in Ukraine and the Gaza Strip, both of which Trump has vowed to end.\n\nTrump also did not address another time-sensitive issue: how to prevent the government from shutting down next week. Even with Republicans controlling the House and the Senate, there are still disagreements about the best ways to proceed on the funding battle.\n\nThe president reiterated that he wants Congress to allocate more money for immigration enforcement while cutting taxes, but how lawmakers will achieve that remains unclear.\n\nTrump is still re-litigating the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump is always in need of an opponent, and for now, it appears former President Joe Biden is still in his cross hairs. Even after winning the election in November, defeating Kamala Harris, Trump mentioned his predecessor's administration more than a dozen times and called Biden \"the worst president in American history.\"\n\nHe blamed Biden for a litany of problems, including the high costs of eggs, crime and drugs flooding across the border, and accused him of being weak on China.\n\nAt times, Trump appeared to be giving one of his stump speeches from the campaign trail, as he railed against Biden's immigration policies, support of transgender rights and \"wokeness.\"\n\n\"Wokeness is trouble. Wokeness is bad,\" Trump said, without specifying what exactly he was referring to. \"It's gone. It's gone.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.","summary":"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump took a defiant victory lap in the House chamber on Tuesday night, using his address to a joint session of Congress to promote the flurry of drastic changes to domestic and foreign policy that his…","url":"https://www.berkshireeagle.com/nyt/6-takeaways-from-trumps-address-to-congress/article_28e527a1-10b7-52c9-94f1-12b9003996df.html","image":"https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/berkshireeagle.com/content/tncms/custom/image/2b802cce-8455-11ec-8935-3f9640429655.jpg?resize=600%2C315","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 14:38:31","author":"North Adams Pride,Tyler Pager","authors":["North Adams Pride","Tyler Pager"],"language":"en","category":"sports","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.184},{"id":296988330,"title":"It Turns Out Trump Didn’t Need Border Bill That Dems Said Was Essential To Taming Illegal Immigration Crisis","text":"President Donald Trump pushed border encounters to historical lows, and did so without signing into law a bipartisan border deal relentlessly lauded by his Democratic opponents.\n\nHomeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed that there were a mere 200 migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border on Feb. 22, marking the lowest single-day apprehension number in over 15 years. This milestone was followed up by President Donald Trump’s announcement that there were only 8,326 migrant apprehensions at the border during his first full month in office, a figure dwarfed by the regular monthly averages seen during the previous administration. (RELATED: Democrat Complains About ICE Arresting Migrant ‘Parent’ Outside School. Turns Out Perp Is Twice-Deported Gangbanger)\n\nThe southern border is becoming so quiet that Tom Homan, who is leading the Trump administration’s deportation operation, says he doesn’t recall activity this calm in his entire career in federal immigration enforcement. The border czar first began working for the Border Patrol in 1984.\n\nControl of the southern border happened despite bipartisan border legislation introduced in early 2024 never becoming law. Then-President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris — who both claimed the bill was absolutely necessary in fixing the border crisis that began under their watch — repeatedly blamed Trump for its failure to pass Congress.\n\n“Why? A simple reason: Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump thinks it’s bad for him politically,” Biden said in February 2024 about the bill’s failure. “Therefore, he doesn’t — even though it would help the country, he’s not for it.”\n\n“He’d rather weaponize this issue than actually solve it,” the former president continued.\n\nThe bipartisan border deal — introduced by Oklahoma GOP Sen. James Lankford, Democrat Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut and former independent Sen. Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona — was a multi-billion dollar package that aimed to reduce border crossings by imposing stricter immigration and asylum laws. However, the bill also included provisions that ostensibly had nothing to do with the border crisis, such as aid to Ukraine, Taiwan and Israel, and it quickly fell out of favor with many GOP lawmakers.\n\nBiden was far from the only Democrat to blame Trump and claim the legislation was paramount to fixing the border crisis. Harris, who replaced Biden as the Democratic presidential nominee following his disastrous debate performance, made it a top theme in her immigration platform.\n\n“But you know what happened to that bill?” Harris asked during her presidential debate with Trump in September. “Donald Trump got on the phone, called up some folks in Congress, and said kill the bill.”\n\n“And you know why? Because he preferred to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,” Harris said.\n\nHowever, since re-entering office, every metric appears to indicate that the Trump administration is fixing the immigration crisis. Not only have migrant encounters along the U.S-Mexico border fallen to historical lows, but popular migrant routes far south of Mexico have plummeted in activity — indicating that many would-be illegal migrants are simply not even bothering to enter the U.S. under the current administration.\n\nMore than half a million migrants crossed the Darien Gap, a vast jungle region between Panama and Colombia, at the height of the migrant crisis in 2023. Migrant crossings through the Darien dropped a staggering 94% in January compared to the same month last year, according to data released by Panama’s National Migration Service.\n\nAuthorities in Central America have since reported on a reverse migratory trend unfolding in the region, with many migrants now actually heading the opposite direction to reach destinations in South America — and even paying smugglers to help them.\n\n“Along the U.S. – Mexico frontier, Customs and Border Protection is currently reporting some of the lowest numbers of illegal alien encounters ever,” Matt O’Brien, investigation director for the Immigration Reform Law institute, said in a statement to the Daily Caller News Foundation. “This is proof-positive all that has ever been needed to secure America’s borders is a Trump-style commitment to actually using the enforcement authorities that have been in the Immigration and Nationality Act for decades.”\n\n“The Biden Administration claims that it couldn’t end illegal migration without passing an absurd new immigration bill were never anything but lies aimed at gaslighting the American public,” O’Brien said.\n\nOn his first day back in the Oval Office, Trump signed a flurry of executive orders aimed at controlling the southern border. His orders included a national emergency declaration allowing him to divert more military resources to the U.S.-Mexico border and resume wall construction, a designation of drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations, a pause on refugee admissions and an end to birthright citizenship for individuals born on U.S. soil to illegal migrant parents.\n\nTrump successfully coerced both the Mexican and Canadian governments to do more to bolster border security, including a commitment of 10,000 national guard troops by Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum to help stop the flow of illegal immigration and illicit drugs.\n\nThe White House has also overseen a number of administrative changes, such as the cancellation of the CBP One app, the removal of “sensitive location” restrictions for deportation officers, and the marshaling of nearly every federal agency to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement in its arrest and deportation mission. The result has been the arrest of more than 20,000 illegal migrants in Trump’s first month in office, a rate far outpacing the Biden administration.\n\nThe actions are a far cry from Biden’s first month in office. The former president began by immediately attempting to order a moratorium on deportations for his first 100 days, and went on to issue a slate of executive orders that specifically unrolled the immigration enforcement apparatus built under Trump’s first term.\n\nBiden also immediately halted border wall construction, shuttered the Remain in Mexico program, ended Safe Third Country agreements with key Latin American nations and undertook other actions that opened up the country to illegal immigration. Altogether, his administration made 296 executive actions on immigration issues in his first year in office.\n\nWhat followed after these executive orders was an unprecedented level of unlawful migration into the U.S. Fiscal year 2024 was the second worst year in history for illegal immigration, with nearly three million inadmissible encounters taking place, a number only surpassed by the record level experienced the previous year. An analysis by The New York Times found the level of net migration into the country under Biden was the largest in the country’s history.\n\nImmigration hawks argue that all it took was the enforcement of laws already on the books, not the passage of new laws, to get the southern border under control.\n\n“Instead of securing our borders, President Biden refused to enforce America’s immigration laws and instituted four years of open-borders policies,” Joey Chester, communications manager for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, said to the DCNF. “The only reason he and others pushed for the Senate border bill last year is because it codified many of those open-borders policies into law and gave them a talking point to cover for years of reckless policies.”\n\n“The Trump administration has shown that the president has the authority to secure America’s borders, and illegal border crossings have plummeted as a result,” Chester said. “President Trump is doing this by enforcing our immigration laws, apprehending and detaining illegal aliens who cross the border, halting mass parole programs, ending asylum abuse, and shutting down the abuse of the CBP One app for illegal aliens to make appointments to enter the U.S.”\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

(I’ve often thought that this is the wrong way around since I’d trade in two slices of bread for one serving of meat without a second thought.) Well, last night’s speech was the ultimate policy version of a compliment sandwich.\n\nFirst, the positive. Trump’s address felt like a rhetorical version of the first few weeks of his administration: a sheer onslaught of executive actions and promises for the future, providing a comprehensive (and deliberately overwhelming) play-by-play of every one of his actions, while Democrats in the audience looked on in horror, politically castrated by Trump’s trademark style, left to stand fecklessly with their adorable homemade protest signs, well-practiced scowls, and loosely coordinated pink jackets.\n\nOnly Rep. Al Green (D-TX) was actually combative, and he was quickly removed from the House chamber after disrupting the speech early on, sparking cheers and jeers among his Republican opponents, followed by multiple sharp jabs targeting former President Joe Biden, former Vice President Kamala Harris, Sen. Elizabeth “Pocahontas” Warren (D-MA), and the entire Democratic Party, thrown by the president himself.\n\nTrump also played to another of his political strengths: emotion. He spoke directly to the families of 22-year-old Laken Riley and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray, who were both brutally murdered by illegal immigrants. He celebrated the bravery of border patrol agent Roberto Ortiz. He paid tribute to New York police officer Jonathan Diller, who was murdered while on duty in Queens.\n\nAnd he even promoted D.J. Daniel, a 13-year-old boy who has been battling terminal brain cancer since 2018 and who dreams of a life in law enforcement, to be an agent of the United States Secret Service. As his father held D.J. aloft, there wasn’t a dry eye in the house, at least for those with the necessary emotional capability.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump also continued his usual routine of guaranteeing more for the country, promising that “the golden age of America has only just begun,” with more than a few Trumpisms thrown in to elevate his administration’s achievements since Jan. 20.\n\nBut then, we must note that there was a negative filling of the compliment sandwich: the economy. Because while his administration has been objectively successful in the battle against diversity, equity, and inclusion and wokeness, in the fight against illegal immigration, and, depending on your foreign policy leanings, on the world stage, the problem that matters most to the public still hangs in the balance. And it’s obvious that Trump understands this, or at the very least, he understands that the country is not yet sold on Trump’s second economy.\n\nWhile Trump lauded the “beautiful” tariffs that are sowing chaos in world markets, he not only walked back earlier policies by framing them as “reciprocal,” but he openly acknowledged that his tariffs could hurt before they (supposedly) help. Trump, famous for his bravado, his hyperbole, and his shameless ability to self-promote, admitted that there “may be a little bit of an adjustment period” in the aftermath of agricultural tariffs and that there will be “a little disturbance” before tariffs make America rich, protect our jobs, and protect our nation’s soul.\n\nThat’s the closest you’ll ever get to a preemptive apology from Trump. Soak it in.\n\nIn an objective world that cares about more than just politics, this speech would have been dedicated to the one problem that will, whether people like it or not, define Trump’s second term in office: the economy. But thanks to Trump’s successes elsewhere, his skill in this environment, and, yes, the foolishness of Democrats, many of whom didn’t even applaud for a child suffering terminal cancer, his compliment sandwich might just have worked. At least for now.\n\nIan Haworth is a syndicated columnist, speaker, and podcast host.

Greg Abbott seized from federal authorities last year in a feud with the Biden administration, which he accused of not doing enough to curb illegal crossings.\n\nTrump made a crackdown on immigration a centerpiece of his bid for a second term, as he pledged to halt the tide of migrants entering the U.S. and stop the flow of fentanyl crossing the border. As part of that effort, he imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada on Tuesday, saying neither is doing enough to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration. His commerce secretary has suggested a deal to reduce the tariffs is in the works, however, and could be announced as soon as Wednesday.\n\n“They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast,” Trump said of migrants living in the U.S. illegally as he delivered an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night.\n\nAlthough Trump has not made a trip to the border since his inauguration, the visit of three of his top officials is evidence of the scope of his administration's focus on the issue. He has tasked agencies across the federal government with working to overhaul border and immigration policy, moving well beyond the Department of Homeland Security, the traditional home of most such functions.\n\nArrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico plummeted 39% in January from a month earlier, though they’ve been falling sharply since well before Trump took office on Jan. 20 from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023. Since then, Mexican authorities increased enforcement within their own borders and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, introduced severe asylum restrictions early last summer.\n\nThe Trump administration has showcased its new initiatives, including putting shackled immigrants on U.S. military planes for deportation fights and sending some to the U.S. lockup at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. It has also expanded federal agents’ arrests of people in the U.S. illegally and abandoned programs that gave some permission to stay.\n\nTrump border czar Tom Homan said migrants with criminal records have been prioritized in early efforts to round up and deport people in the U.S. illegally, but he added of other migrants, “If you’re in the county illegally, you’re not off the table.”\n\n“When we find the bad guy, many times they’re with others, others who aren’t a criminal priority, but were in the country illegally,” Homan told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday. “They’re coming, too.”\n\nSince Trump’s second term began, about 6,500 new active duty forces have been ordered to deploy to the southern border. Before that, there were about 2,500 troops already there, largely National Guard troops on active duty orders, along with a couple of hundred active duty aviation forces.\n\nOf those being mobilized, many are still only preparing to go. Last weekend, Hegseth approved orders to send a large portion of an Army Stryker brigade and a general support aviation battalion to the border. Totaling about 3,000 troops, they are expected to deploy in the coming weeks.\n\nTroops are responsible for detection and monitoring along the border but don’t interact with migrants attempting to illegally cross. Instead, they alert border agents, who then take the migrants into custody.\n\nBiden tasked Vice President Kamala Harris with tackling the root causes of immigration during his administration, seeking to zero in on why so many migrants, particularly from Central America, were leaving their homelands and coming to the U.S. seeking asylum or trying to make it into the county illegally.\n\nHarris made her first visit to the border in June 2021, about 3 1/2 months deeper into Biden's term than Vance's trip in the opening weeks of Trump's second term. Trump has routinely joked that Harris was in charge of immigration policy but didn’t visit the border or even maintain close phone contact with federal officials.\n\nVance's trip comes as the Trump administration is considering the use of the Alien Enemy Act of 1798 to detain and deport Venezuelans based on a proclamation labeling the gang Tren de Aragua an invasion force that could be acting at the behest of that country's government. That's according to a U.S. official with knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal administration deliberations.\n\nIt is unclear how close the decisions are to being finalized. Some officials have questioned whether the gang is acting as a tool for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom the U.S. has not recognized as that country’s legitimate leader. There are some concerns that invoking the law would require the U.S. to more formally recognize Maduro.\n\nStill, the 1798 law allows the president to deport any noncitizen from a country with which the U.S. is at war, and it has been mentioned by Trump as a possible tool to speed up his mass deportations.\n\nWeissert reported from Washington.

Jon Ossoff and Gary Peters are both in swing states that went red for Trump in 2024. The former is in Georgia, which voted for Trump over Kamala Harris by 2.2 percent, and the latter is in Michigan, which at a lower margin went red by 1.4 percent.\n\nWith Peters retiring from the Senate at the expiration of his term, the election is open and therefore even more likely to swing the seat to the right.\n\nAll 20 Republicans whose terms are expiring at the start of 2027 are in solidly red states with none of the elections considered a toss-up.\n\nAt least one Republican – Kentucky Sen. Mitch McConnell – is retiring at the end of the current term and will need to be replaced in next year's elections.\n\nA party has not had 60 seats in the Senate since the 95th Congress from 1977-1979 when Democrats had 61 members of the upper chamber and Republicans had only 38 – with one independent caucusing with Democrats.\n\nMusk predicts the Senate will get a 60-senator majority for the first time since the late 1970s\n\nBut Musk thinks despite there being only two Democratic seats considered a 'toss-up' by the Cook Political Report, Republicans still have the momentum to nab a net seven seats to bring their majority to 60.\n\nThe DOGE leader and X CEO got a coveted shoutout by Trump during his joint session before Congress on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe billionaire stood and saluted Trump as the president showered praise on the billionaire 'first buddy' for his work slashing federal spending and government waste.\n\nAnd to laughs from Democrats, Trump claimed that even the opposition party 'appreciates' Musk's efforts.\n\n'I have created the brand new Department of Government Efficiency – DOGE, perhaps you've heard of it, which is headed by Elon Musk who is in the gallery tonight,' Trump said as he looked up to where Musk was seated in the gallery for the remarks.\n\n'Thank you, Elon.

He supports President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk's cost-cutting program — even if it affects the VA.\n\n“We're no better because we're veterans,” said Watson, 68, of Jesup, Georgia. “We all need to take a step back and realize that everybody’s gonna have to take a little bit on the chin to get these budget matters under control.”\n\nGregg Bafundo served during the first Gulf War and has nerve damage to his feet from carrying loads of weight as a Marine mortarman. He says he may need to turn to the VA for care after being fired as a wilderness ranger and firefighter through the layoffs at the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n“They’re going to put guys like me and my fellow Marines that rely on the VA in the ground,” said Bafundo, 53, who lives in Tonasket, Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration's move to end hundreds of VA contracts — halted after public outcry — and ongoing layoffs are affecting the nation's veterans, a critical and politically influential constituency. More than 9 million veterans get physical and mental health care from the VA, which is now being examined by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe VA manages a $350 billion-plus budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals, many in Republican-led states and districts. Veterans have shown up at town hall-style meetings to voice their anger, and groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars are mobilizing against cuts.\n\nVeterans were much likelier to support Trump, a Republican, than Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in November’s presidential election, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states. Nearly 6 in 10 voters who are veterans backed Trump, while about 4 in 10 voted for Harris.\n\nJoy Ilem, national legislative director for the nonpartisan group Disabled American Veterans, said her group was studying how the ongoing cuts might affect care.\n\n\"You could lose trust among the veteran population over some of these things that have happened and the way that they’ve happened,” Ilem warned. “And we do fear damage to the recruitment and retention of hiring the best and brightest to serve veterans.”\n\nThe White House said last week that it wants to slash $2 billion worth of VA contracts, which would affect anything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The department quickly paused the cuts following concerns about the impact on critical health services.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 1,000 VA employees who served for less than two years were dismissed last month. According to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that included researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure.\n\nVA Secretary Doug Collins told Fox News Channel this week that the effort was focused on “finding deficiencies.”\n\n“Anything that we're doing is designed and will not cut veterans' health or veterans' benefits that they've earned,” he said.\n\nIn a Tuesday statement to The Associated Press, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency “is putting Veterans at the center of everything the department does.”\n\n“Every dollar we spend on wasteful contracts, non-mission-critical or duplicative activities is one less dollar we can spend on Veterans, and given that choice, we will always side with the Veteran,” Kasperowicz wrote.\n\nRepublicans have pointed out that the VA has rehired employees who were let go during an initial round of layoffs in February, such as those working for a crisis hotline. However, during a subsequent round of layoffs, the VA cut 15 other employees who were in jobs supporting the crisis line, including a trainer for the phone responders, according to congressional staff who are tracking the cuts.\n\nThe VA has long faced calls for reform \n\nThe VA has been plagued for years by allegations of poor medical care and excessively long wait times. Investigators a decade ago uncovered widespread problems in how VA hospitals were scheduling appointments after allegations that as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting care at the department's Phoenix hospital. A group of employees accused the department of retaliating against potential whistleblowers. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, eventually put into place a program allowing veterans to go outside the VA system to seek medical care. The Choice Program was extended by Trump during his first term.\n\nRichard Lamb, who was shot down twice in Vietnam as an Army helicopter crew chief, said the department should be “cut to the bone.”\n\nLamb, 74, said he broke vertebrae each time his helicopter was shot down. Decades passed, he said, before a private doctor — not the VA — found compression fractures and performed surgery.\n\n“I’d be happy to see VA, not torn down, but cleaned up, cleaned out and recast,” said Lamb, who lives in Waco, Texas. “The VA is supposed to be a wonderful thing for veterans.

It sucks.”\n\nDaniel Ragsdale Combs, a Navy veteran with a traumatic brain injury, strongly disagrees.\n\nRagsdale Combs, 45, suffered his injury while running to respond to an order on an aircraft carrier and striking his head above a hatchway. He receives group therapy for mental illness brought on by the injury but says he had heard those sessions might be canceled or reduced due to staffing shortages.\n\n“I’m deeply concerned because the VA has been nothing but great to me,” said Ragsdale Combs, who lives in Mesa, Arizona. “I’m angry, upset and frustrated.”\n\nLucy Wong relies on a team of VA doctors in the Phoenix area to treat her scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that attacks connective tissue. She said she developed the disease as a medical technician in the Navy in the 1980s, working with toxic chemicals and enduring extreme stress.\n\nDriving is difficult. She worries that the VA will cut Uber rides to her medical appointments, among other things.\n\n“I ask if Trump is cutting anything back here, and the reply is, ‘Not yet,’\" Wong said.\n\nJosh Ghering, a former Marine from Parsons, Kansas, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he had to fly to San Antonio for an appointment with a neurologist before he was medically retired for back issues, including herniated discs. He questioned why he couldn’t get the same appointment closer to home.\n\n“I think they’re headed in the right direction,” Ghering, 42, said of DOGE. “But they’re going to have to be more thorough with what it is they’re doing, to make sure they’re not cutting jobs that are needed.”\n\nWill service members be expected to accept VA cuts? \n\nThe nation’s service members have never been a political monolith — and the same holds true for their views on the VA. But the split between two Marines on opposite sides of the country raises a question not just about DOGE but about America's military: Who is expected to sacrifice?\n\nWatson, the former Marine in Georgia, sustained various injuries while serving, including a traumatic brain injury when a cable snapped and a crate fell on him. He said he's willing to accept fewer visits to his VA doctor and forgo other conveniences as a matter of service to the country.\n\n“Many veterans who voted for Trump understood this was going to be his policy and are now screaming bloody murder because the axe is going to fall upon the VA,” Watson said. “And to me, that’s just a little bit self-centered.”\n\nBafundo, the Marine in Washington state, pushed back against the idea that all Americans are making a sacrifice when, as he sees it, it's really falling back \"on the little guy.”\n\nAmerica’s billionaires won’t be shouldering any of the burden, he argued, while Musk, who's the world's richest person, and others pay little, if any, taxes.\n\n“If we’re going to sacrifice, the wealthy need to sacrifice, too,” he said. “And, frankly, they don’t.”\n\nGroves reported from Washington.","summary":"A handful of veterans are divided over the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs.","url":"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/03/05/veterans-are-speaking-out-trump-administrations-plans-cut-vas-budget.html","image":"https://images02.military.com/sites/default/files/styles/full/public/2025-03/ApNewsroom_Trump_DOGE_Veterans_Affairs_86789.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 14:03:25","author":"Ben Finley,Stephen Groves","authors":["Ben Finley","Stephen Groves"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.038},{"id":297044090,"title":"Someone Wake Me Up: Democrats Respond to Trump’s Speech","text":"Democrats criticized Donald Trump’s inaugural prime-time address to Congress after his return to the White House, as the reactions revealed a nation still greatly divided along political lines, with the opposition party struggling to understand how to counter his extreme agenda.\n\nThe Democrats’ lack of representation in key government roles – being in the minority in both the Senate and House of Representatives – has left them with few strategies to effectively respond to Trump’s lengthy 1-hour and 40-minute speech, which was essentially a celebration of his alleged accomplishments since taking office six weeks ago.\n\nSeveral emerging leaders within the party, like Chris Murphy, a prominent senator from Connecticut, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive congresswoman from New York, opted to protest by not attending the event.\n\nThose who chose to attend displayed their discontent by turning their backs on Trump while he spoke and by holding up signs that read “No kings,” “Save Medicaid,” and “Musk steals,” in reference to the significant cost-cutting initiatives led by billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.\n\nThe protest was mockingly likened to bingo cards by one typically supportive commentator, Symne Sanders-Townsend, a host on MSNBC.\n\n“Why are Democrats just sitting there? The signs are not connecting. It feels like bingo! Sigh,” she tweeted on X.\n\nThe audience, composed of silent and grim-faced Democrats – some adorned with Ukrainian flags or wearing colors representing the country – served as the perfect backdrop for Trump to take jabs at them in real time.\n\n“I look at the Democrats in front of me, and I realize there is absolutely nothing I can say to make them happy or to make them stand or smile or applaud, nothing I can do,” Trump remarked. “These people sitting right here will not clap, will not stand, and certainly will not cheer for these astronomical achievements.”\n\nHowever, not all expressions of discontent from Democrats were passive.\n\nA few members shouted “January 6” – referencing the attack on the US Capitol in 2021, incited by Trump – as he pledged to enforce “law and order” while praising the police.\n\nThe most vocal act of defiance came from Al Green, a congressman from Texas, who was removed from the chamber by House Speaker Mike Johnson after he heckled Trump, asserting that Trump had no mandate.\n\nFollowing the incident, Green, 77, who is drafting articles of impeachment against Trump, told reporters that his removal was “worth it to inform people that some of us will stand up.”\n\nA more restrained Democratic response was articulated by Elissa Slotkin, a senator from Michigan, selected to deliver the party’s official rebuttal. She won her seat last November in a competitive election battleground state where Trump narrowly triumphed over Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nSlotkin, a former CIA officer, criticized Trump’s apparent abandonment of Ukraine, asserting that Ronald Reagan, a previous Republican president, would be “turning in his grave” at the current president’s submissiveness to Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader.\n\n“President Trump loves to tout ‘peace through strength’,” she said in a televised response from her hometown of Wyandotte, Michigan. “That’s actually a phrase he borrowed from Ronald Reagan. But let me tell you, after the spectacle that just unfolded in the Oval Office last week, Reagan must be rolling over in his grave.\n\n“We all desire an end to the war in Ukraine, but Reagan understood that true strength required America to align its military and economic capabilities with moral integrity.\n\n“As a child of the Cold War, I’m grateful it was Reagan and not Trump in the 1980s. Trump would have cost us the Cold War.”\n\nSlotkin also sought to energize her Democratic colleagues against the apathy stemming from Trump’s assertive agenda, while instilling hope in citizens concerned about the future of US democracy.\n\n“I’ve lived and worked in various countries. I’ve witnessed democracies fade away. I’ve experienced life under a rigged government,” she asserted. “Don’t ever deceive yourself into thinking that democracy isn’t valuable and worth fighting for.”\n\nEncouraging resistance against an apparently unchecked Trump, she continued: “Do not reject the fight. America needs you now more than ever. If earlier generations hadn’t defended democracy, where would we be today? We all recognize that our nation is navigating through something significant at the moment. We’re uncertain of what tomorrow may bring, not to mention the coming decade.\n\n“But this is not the first time we’ve faced major and tumultuous transformations as a nation. Every single time, we’ve emerged from those periods through two essential elements: engaged citizens and principled leaders.”\n\nJasmine Crocket, a Democratic congresswoman from Texas, used more vivid language as she vowed to confront Trump, whom she labeled “truly psychotic” for his claim during the speech regarding an intent to acquire Greenland.\n\n“Why are we in a conflict with Greenland?” she asked Adam Mockler from the progressive MeidasTouch Network. “We’re at odds with Canada, and Mexico, yet we’re enamored with Putin?

He supports President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk's cost-cutting program — even if it affects the VA.\n\n“We're no better because we're veterans,” said Watson, 68, of Jesup, Georgia. “We all need to take a step back and realize that everybody’s gonna have to take a little bit on the chin to get these budget matters under control.”\n\nGregg Bafundo served during the first Gulf War and has nerve damage to his feet from carrying loads of weight as a Marine mortarman. He says he may need to turn to the VA for care after being fired as a wilderness ranger and firefighter through the layoffs at the U.S. Forest Service.\n\n“They’re going to put guys like me and my fellow Marines that rely on the VA in the ground,” said Bafundo, 53, who lives in Tonasket, Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration's move to end hundreds of VA contracts — halted after public outcry — and ongoing layoffs are affecting the nation's veterans, a critical and politically influential constituency. More than 9 million veterans get physical and mental health care from the VA, which is now being examined by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe VA manages a $350 billion-plus budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals, many in Republican-led states and districts. Veterans have shown up at town hall-style meetings to voice their anger, and groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars are mobilizing against cuts.\n\nVeterans were much likelier to support Trump, a Republican, than Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in November’s presidential election, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states. Nearly 6 in 10 voters who are veterans backed Trump, while about 4 in 10 voted for Harris.\n\nJoy Ilem, national legislative director for the nonpartisan group Disabled American Veterans, said her group was studying how the ongoing cuts might affect care.\n\n\"You could lose trust among the veteran population over some of these things that have happened and the way that they’ve happened,” Ilem warned. “And we do fear damage to the recruitment and retention of hiring the best and brightest to serve veterans.”\n\nThe White House said last week that it wants to slash $2 billion worth of VA contracts, which would affect anything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The department quickly paused the cuts following concerns about the impact on critical health services.\n\nMeanwhile, more than 1,000 VA employees who served for less than two years were dismissed last month. According to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that included researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure.\n\nVA Secretary Doug Collins told Fox News Channel this week that the effort was focused on “finding deficiencies.”\n\n“Anything that we're doing is designed and will not cut veterans' health or veterans' benefits that they've earned,” he said.\n\nIn a Tuesday statement to The Associated Press, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency “is putting Veterans at the center of everything the department does.”\n\n“Every dollar we spend on wasteful contracts, non-mission-critical or duplicative activities is one less dollar we can spend on Veterans, and given that choice, we will always side with the Veteran,” Kasperowicz wrote.\n\nRepublicans have pointed out that the VA has rehired employees who were let go during an initial round of layoffs in February, such as those working for a crisis hotline. However, during a subsequent round of layoffs, the VA cut 15 other employees who were in jobs supporting the crisis line, including a trainer for the phone responders, according to congressional staff who are tracking the cuts.\n\nThe VA has long faced calls for reform\n\nThe VA has been plagued for years by allegations of poor medical care and excessively long wait times. Investigators a decade ago uncovered widespread problems in how VA hospitals were scheduling appointments after allegations that as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting care at the department's Phoenix hospital. A group of employees accused the department of retaliating against potential whistleblowers. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, eventually put into place a program allowing veterans to go outside the VA system to seek medical care. The Choice Program was extended by Trump during his first term.\n\nRichard Lamb, who was shot down twice in Vietnam as an Army helicopter crew chief, said the department should be “cut to the bone.”\n\nLamb, 74, said he broke vertebrae each time his helicopter was shot down. Decades passed, he said, before a private doctor — not the VA — found compression fractures and performed surgery.\n\n“I’d be happy to see VA, not torn down, but cleaned up, cleaned out and recast,” said Lamb, who lives in Waco, Texas. “The VA is supposed to be a wonderful thing for veterans. It’s not. It sucks.”\n\nDaniel Ragsdale Combs, a Navy veteran with a traumatic brain injury, strongly disagrees.\n\nRagsdale Combs, 45, suffered his injury while running to respond to an order on an aircraft carrier and striking his head above a hatchway.

America wants change,” she said.\n\n“But there is a responsible way to make change, and a reckless way. And, we can make that change without forgetting who we are as a country, and as a democracy.”\n\nThroughout the election, voters frequently said the economy was their number one concern, and Democrats’ defeat was blamed on not addressing it sufficiently.\n\nWeeks into Trump’s presidency, economic concerns remain high, as prices of a number of goods have not dropped, and prices on some items, like eggs, have risen.\n\n“Grocery and home prices are going up, not down – and he hasn’t laid out a credible plan to deal with either,” she said.\n\nSlotkin also talked about immigration, another topic where Democrats poll worse than Republicans, highlighting a lack of empathy by the Trump administration toward undocumented immigrants.\n\n“The border without actually fixing our broken immigration system is dealing with the symptom not the disease. America is a nation of immigrants,” she said.\n\nShe cited the public berating of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday during a meeting withTrump and Vice-President JD Vance, too.\n\n“That scene in the Oval Office wasn’t just a bad episode of reality TV.

He said she was “great on both economic and national security” topics.\n\nSlotkin is new to the Senate, but she served in Congress as a member of Michigan’s delegation to the House of Representatives. She was first elected in the Democrats’ 2018 wave of success, flipping a Republican seat.\n\nPrior to her political career, she held a variety of government jobs. She held national security positions in Presidents George W Bush and Barack Obama’s administrations.\n\nShe served in Bush’s National Security Council, and, under Obama, she served as acting assistant secretary of defence for international security affairs and in the State Department.\n\nThe CIA recruited Slotkin, who is fluent in Arabic and Swahili, shortly after she earned a graduate degree in international affairs at Columbia University in New York City. She served three tours in Iraq as a CIA analyst.\n\nThe moderate Democrat focused her 2024 Senate campaign on lowering costs for Americans, a move that helped propel her to a narrow victory over former Congressman Mike Rogers, even as Trump won the state.\n\nSlotkin is a member of the committees on Armed Forces; Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs; Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry; and Veterans Affairs. – BBC\n\nBy Madeline Halpert and Brandon Drenon","summary":"Elissa Slotkin, a US Senate Democrat, gave her party&#8217;s response to Trump&#8217;s congressional address, taking the new Trump administration to task for...","url":"https://dailynews.co.zw/who-is-elissa-slotkin-the-democrat-who-responded-to-trumps-speech/","image":"https://dailynews.co.zw/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Elissa-Slotkin.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 13:16:47","author":"Staff Writer","authors":["Staff Writer"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zw","sentiment":-0.028},{"id":297113548,"title":"‘Somebody slap me and wake me up’: Democrats react to Trump’s speech","text":"Democrats panned Donald Trump’s first prime-time speech to Congress since returning to the White House as reaction to the address revealed a country still deeply split on political lines and an opposition party unsure of how to deal with his radical agenda.\n\nThe Democrats’ exclusion from the corridors of powers – Democrats are in the minority in both the Senate and House of Representatives – has left them with limited options on how to effectively respond to Trump’s hardline 1hr 40min oration that amounted to a celebration of his purported achievements during his six weeks back in office.\n\nSome of the party’s rising stars, including Chris Murphy, a vocal senator from Connecticut, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive representative from New York, protested by staying away.\n\nThose who attended showed their displeasure by turning their backs on Trump as he spoke and holding up placards with messages like “No kings”, “Save Medicaid” and “Musk steals” in reference to the leading government cost-cutting role being played by the billionaire tech entrepreneur Elon Musk.\n\nThe protest was disparagingly compared to bingo signs by one normally sympathetic commentator, Symne Sanders-Townsend, a host on the MSNBC channel.\n\n“Why are democrats just sitting there?

I’ve seen democracies flicker out.

Vance will be joined in Eagle Pass, Texas, by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard as the highest-ranking members of Trump's Republican White House to visit the southern border. Federal aviation authorities have cleared airspace for Air Force Two to make the trip, and state authorities and local activists say Vance's itinerary includes a visit to Shelby Park, a municipal greenspace along the Rio Grande that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott seized from federal authorities last year in a feud with the Biden administration, which he accused of not doing enough to curb illegal crossings. Trump made a crackdown on immigration a centerpiece of his bid for a second term, as he pledged to halt the tide of migrants entering the U.S. and stop the flow of fentanyl crossing the border. As part of that effort, he imposed 25% tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada on Tuesday, saying neither is doing enough to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration. His commerce secretary has suggested a deal to reduce the tariffs is in the works, however, and could be announced as soon as Wednesday. They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast, Trump said of migrants living in the U.S. illegally as he delivered an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. Although Trump has not made a trip to the border since his inauguration, the visit of three of his top officials is evidence of the scope of his administration's focus on the issue. He has tasked agencies across the federal government with working to overhaul border and immigration policy, moving well beyond the Department of Homeland Security, the traditional home of most such functions. Arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico plummeted 39% in January from a month earlier, though they've been falling sharply since well before Trump took office on Jan. 20 from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023. Since then, Mexican authorities increased enforcement within their own borders and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, introduced severe asylum restrictions early last summer. The Trump administration has showcased its new initiatives, including putting shackled immigrants on U.S. military planes for deportation fights and sending some to the U.S. lockup at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. It has also expanded federal agents' arrests of people in the U.S. illegally and abandoned programs that gave some permission to stay. Trump border czar Tom Homan said migrants with criminal records have been prioritized in early efforts to round up and deport people in the U.S. illegally, but he added of other migrants, If you're in the county illegally, you're not off the table. When we find the bad guy, many times they're with others, others who aren't a criminal priority, but were in the country illegally, Homan told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday. They're coming, too. Since Trump's second term began, about 6,500 new active duty forces have been ordered to deploy to the southern border. Before that, there were about 2,500 troops already there, largely National Guard troops on active duty orders, along with a couple of hundred active duty aviation forces. Of those being mobilized, many are still only preparing to go. Last weekend, Hegseth approved orders to send a large portion of an Army Stryker brigade and a general support aviation battalion to the border. Totaling about 3,000 troops, they are expected to deploy in the coming weeks.

It is unclear how close the decisions are to being finalized. Some officials have questioned whether the gang is acting as a tool for Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whom the U.S. has not recognized as that country's legitimate leader. There are some concerns that invoking the law would require the U.S. to more formally recognize Maduro.

Vance will be joined in Eagle Pass, Texas, by Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard as the highest-ranking members of Trump's Republican White House to visit the southern border.

Federal aviation authorities have cleared airspace for Air Force Two to make the trip, and state authorities and local activists say Vance's itinerary includes a visit to Shelby Park, a municipal greenspace along the Rio Grande that Republican Gov. Greg Abbott seized from federal authorities last year in a feud with the Biden administration, which he accused of not doing enough to curb illegal crossings. Trump made a crackdown on immigration a centrepiece of his bid for a second term, as he pledged to halt the tide of migrants entering the US and stop the flow of fentanyl crossing the border.

As part of that effort, he imposed 25 per cent tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada on Tuesday, saying neither is doing enough to address drug trafficking and illegal immigration. His commerce secretary has suggested a deal to reduce the tariffs is in the works, however, and could be announced as soon as Wednesday. “They are now strongly embedded in our country. But we are getting them out and getting them out fast,” Trump said of migrants living in the US illegally as he delivered an address to a joint session of Congress on Tuesday night. Although Trump has not made a trip to the border since his inauguration, the visit of three of his top officials is evidence of the scope of his administration's focus on the issue. He has tasked agencies across the federal government with working to overhaul border and immigration policy, moving well beyond the Department of Homeland Security, the traditional home of most such functions. Arrests for illegal border crossings from Mexico plummeted 39 per cent in January from a month earlier, though they've been falling sharply since well before Trump took office on January 20 from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023. Since then, Mexican authorities increased enforcement within their own borders and President Joe Biden, a Democrat, introduced severe asylum restrictions early last summer. The Trump administration has showcased its new initiatives, including putting shackled immigrants on US military planes for deportation fights and sending some to the US lockup at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. It has also expanded federal agents' arrests of people in the US illegally and abandoned programmes that gave some permission to stay. Trump border czar Tom Homan said migrants with criminal records have been prioritised in early efforts to round up and deport people in the US illegally, but he added of other migrants, “If you're in the county illegally, you're not off the table.” “When we find the bad guy, many times they're with others, others who aren't a criminal priority, but were in the country illegally,” Homan told reporters outside the White House on Tuesday. “They're coming, too.” Since Trump's second term began, about 6,500 new active duty forces have been ordered to deploy to the southern border. Before that, there were about 2,500 troops already there, largely National Guard troops on active duty orders, along with a couple of hundred active duty aviation forces. Of those being mobilised, many are still only preparing to go. Last weekend, Hegseth approved orders to send a large portion of an Army Stryker brigade and a general support aviation battalion to the border. Totalling about 3,000 troops, they are expected to deploy in the coming weeks. Troops are responsible for detection and monitoring along the border but don't interact with migrants attempting to illegally cross. Instead, they alert border agents, who then take the migrants into custody.

He supports President Donald Trump and adviser Elon Musk's cost-cutting program — even if it affects the VA. \n\n“We're no better because we're veterans,” said Watson, 68, of Jesup, Georgia. “We all need to take a step back and realize that everybody’s gonna have to take a little bit on the chin to get these budget matters under control.” \n\nGregg Bafundo served during the first Gulf War and has nerve damage to his feet from carrying loads of weight as a Marine mortarman. He says he may need to turn to the VA for care after being fired as a wilderness ranger and firefighter through the layoffs at the U.S. Forest Service. \n\n“They’re going to put guys like me and my fellow Marines that rely on the VA in the ground,” said Bafundo, 53, who lives in Tonasket, Washington.\n\nThe Trump administration's move to end hundreds of VA contracts — halted after public outcry — and ongoing layoffs are affecting the nation's veterans, a critical and politically influential constituency. More than 9 million veterans get physical and mental health care from the VA, which is now being examined by Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. \n\nThe VA manages a $350 billion-plus budget and oversees nearly 200 medical centers and hospitals, many in Republican-led states and districts. Veterans have shown up at town hall-style meetings to voice their anger, and groups like the Veterans of Foreign Wars are mobilizing against cuts.\n\nVeterans were much likelier to support Trump, a Republican, than Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, in November’s presidential election, according to AP VoteCast, a survey of the American electorate conducted in all 50 states. Nearly 6 in 10 voters who are veterans backed Trump, while about 4 in 10 voted for Harris.\n\nJoy Ilem, national legislative director for the nonpartisan group Disabled American Veterans, said her group was studying how the ongoing cuts might affect care.\n\n\"You could lose trust among the veteran population over some of these things that have happened and the way that they’ve happened,” Ilem warned. “And we do fear damage to the recruitment and retention of hiring the best and brightest to serve veterans.”\n\nThe White House said last week that it wants to slash $2 billion worth of VA contracts, which would affect anything from cancer care to the ability to assess toxic exposure. The department quickly paused the cuts following concerns about the impact on critical health services. \n\nMeanwhile, more than 1,000 VA employees who served for less than two years were dismissed last month. According to Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., that included researchers working on cancer treatment, opioid addiction, prosthetics and burn pit exposure.\n\nVA Secretary Doug Collins told Fox News Channel this week that the effort was focused on “finding deficiencies.”\n\n“Anything that we're doing is designed and will not cut veterans' health or veterans' benefits that they've earned,” he said.\n\nIn a Tuesday statement to The Associated Press, VA press secretary Peter Kasperowicz said the agency “is putting Veterans at the center of everything the department does.” \n\n“Every dollar we spend on wasteful contracts, non-mission-critical or duplicative activities is one less dollar we can spend on Veterans, and given that choice, we will always side with the Veteran,” Kasperowicz wrote. \n\nRepublicans have pointed out that the VA has rehired employees who were let go during an initial round of layoffs in February, such as those working for a crisis hotline. However, during a subsequent round of layoffs, the VA cut 15 other employees who were in jobs supporting the crisis line, including a trainer for the phone responders, according to congressional staff who are tracking the cuts.\n\n The VA has long faced calls for reform \n\nThe VA has been plagued for years by allegations of poor medical care and excessively long wait times. Investigators a decade ago uncovered widespread problems in how VA hospitals were scheduling appointments after allegations that as many as 40 veterans died while awaiting care at the department's Phoenix hospital. A group of employees accused the department of retaliating against potential whistleblowers. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, eventually put into place a program allowing veterans to go outside the VA system to seek medical care. The Choice Program was extended by Trump during his first term.\n\nRichard Lamb, who was shot down twice in Vietnam as an Army helicopter crew chief, said the department should be “cut to the bone.” \n\nLamb, 74, said he broke vertebrae each time his helicopter was shot down. Decades passed, he said, before a private doctor — not the VA — found compression fractures and performed surgery. \n\n“I’d be happy to see VA, not torn down, but cleaned up, cleaned out and recast,” said Lamb, who lives in Waco, Texas. “The VA is supposed to be a wonderful thing for veterans. It’s not. It sucks.”\n\nDaniel Ragsdale Combs, a Navy veteran with a traumatic brain injury, strongly disagrees. \n\nRagsdale Combs, 45, suffered his injury while running to respond to an order on an aircraft carrier and striking his head above a hatchway. He receives group therapy for mental illness brought on by the injury but says he had heard those sessions might be canceled or reduced due to staffing shortages. \n\n“I’m deeply concerned because the VA has been nothing but great to me,” said Ragsdale Combs, who lives in Mesa, Arizona. “I’m angry, upset and frustrated.”\n\nLucy Wong relies on a team of VA doctors in the Phoenix area to treat her scleroderma, an autoimmune condition that attacks connective tissue. She said she developed the disease as a medical technician in the Navy in the 1980s, working with toxic chemicals and enduring extreme stress. \n\nDriving is difficult. She worries that the VA will cut Uber rides to her medical appointments, among other things. \n\n“I ask if Trump is cutting anything back here, and the reply is, ‘Not yet,’\" Wong said. \n\nJosh Ghering, a former Marine from Parsons, Kansas, who served in Iraq and Afghanistan, said he had to fly to San Antonio for an appointment with a neurologist before he was medically retired for back issues, including herniated discs. He questioned why he couldn’t get the same appointment closer to home.\n\n“I think they’re headed in the right direction,” Ghering, 42, said of DOGE. “But they’re going to have to be more thorough with what it is they’re doing, to make sure they’re not cutting jobs that are needed.”\n\n Will service members be expected to accept VA cuts? \n\nThe nation’s service members have never been a political monolith — and the same holds true for their views on the VA. But the split between two Marines on opposite sides of the country raises a question not just about DOGE but about America's military: Who is expected to sacrifice?\n\nWatson, the former Marine in Georgia, sustained various injuries while serving, including a traumatic brain injury when a cable snapped and a crate fell on him. He said he's willing to accept fewer visits to his VA doctor and forgo other conveniences as a matter of service to the country.\n\n“Many veterans who voted for Trump understood this was going to be his policy and are now screaming bloody murder because the axe is going to fall upon the VA,” Watson said. “And to me, that’s just a little bit self-centered.”\n\nBafundo, the Marine in Washington state, pushed back against the idea that all Americans are making a sacrifice when, as he sees it, it's really falling back \"on the little guy.” \n\nAmerica’s billionaires won’t be shouldering any of the burden, he argued, while Musk, who's the world's richest person, and others pay little, if any, taxes.\n\n“If we’re going to sacrifice, the wealthy need to sacrifice, too,” he said. “And, frankly, they don’t.”\n\nGroves reported from Washington.","summary":"A handful of veterans speaking to The Associated Press are divided over the Trump administration's proposed cuts to the Department of Veterans Affairs","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/donald-trump-elon-musk-veterans-norfolk-doug-collins-b2709390.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/03/05/12/Trump_DOGE_Veterans_Affairs_86789.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 12:02:39","author":"Ben Finley","authors":["Ben Finley"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.036},{"id":297113544,"title":"The LA Times’ AI ‘bias meter’ looks like a bid to please Donald Trump | Margaret Sullivan","text":"The past few months have been brutal ones for the readers and journalists of the largest news organization in California, the Los Angeles Times.\n\nSince he bought the paper in 2018, the billionaire and medical entrepreneur Patrick Soon-Shiong has become something of a Donald Trump acolyte.\n\nThat’s his right. Many media owners have political views; but the best keep those views to themselves, or at least allow their news organizations to exercise editorial freedom.\n\nBut Soon-Shiong, who took over promising to steady the ship and return it to financial health, has turned out to be a deeply flawed leader. You might recall that many longtime subscribers canceled their subscriptions months ago when Soon-Shiong blocked his editorial board’s decision to endorse Kamala Harris for president.\n\nThen he reportedly told his editorial board to “take a break” from writing about Trump, and, according to a staff memo signed by members of the opinion section, instituted a policy in which articles critical of the newly elected president were to be published side-by-side with the opposing, pro-Trump, view. That’s straight-up meddling.\n\nBut now, he’s taken a more public-facing step by inflicting what’s become known as a “bias meter” on some LA Times opinion pieces. Its findings are generated by artificial intelligence, without human intervention or review.\n\nIf there’s one firm rule about the use of AI in journalism, it’s this: there should always be a “human in the loop” before publication. Why? Because AI, at least at this point, is often wrong on the facts, and because many news consumers are suspicious of it.\n\nAt the LA Times, the AI-powered “Insights” feature evaluates opinion articles and puts a label on them – for example, “center left”. Then it provides “different views”.\n\nArticles about Trump-related policies have gotten the bias meter treatment – for example, an opinion piece on Ukraine that stated that “Trump is surrendering a century’s worth of US global power in a matter of weeks.” According to the Guardian’s Lois Beckett, that piece is followed by an AI-generated summary of “different views”, such as describing Trump’s policy as “a pragmatic reset of US foreign policy”.\n\nSoon-Shiong called the new feature a victory for viewpoint diversity. “No more echo chamber,” he crowed on social media.\n\nIt looks more like a way to avoid offending President Trump.\n\nLet’s get real. Many opinion pieces at legitimate publications these days are critical of Trump – for good reason, given the chaotic damage he and his helpers have unleashed.\n\nSo this effort is less a rooting out of lefty bias than a way to give a platform to pro-Trump views.\n\nAt well-run news companies, it is journalists themselves – editors, in particular – who can point out unfairness, inaccuracy or bias. And they deal with that, editor to writer, before pieces are published.\n\n“Our members – and all Times staffers – abide by a strict sense of ethics guidelines, which call for fairness, precision, transparency, vigilance against bias, and an earnest search to understand all sides of an issue,” the LA Guild, the union representing the paper’s journalists, said in a statement objecting to Soon-Shiong’s idea.\n\nThese days, many of the opinion-side journalists at the LA Times have fled. This is apparently no longer a place where they feel they can do their jobs.\n\nSoon-Shiong’s gambit is happening in a broader context of media companies yielding to Trump’s will, as Axios’s Sara Fischer aptly noted.\n\nJournalists are doing their jobs, but owners are “compromised”, she wrote, listing some of the most prominent examples: ABC News settled a defamation suit by Trump it could have won; CBS seems poised to settle Trump’s absurd claim against its flagship 60 Minutes show; Disney and Paramount have rolled back some DEI policies; the Washington Post’s opinion section will reflect owner Jeff Bezos’s beliefs about “personal liberties and free markets”.\n\nSome of the bias-meter results so far are simply weird, as in an AI response to an article critical of AI itself. The original piece, by two experts in film production, explored the dangers of AI-generated footage within documentary films and how it could shatter audience trust in the visuals they see.\n\nThe AI-generated bias meter labeled this piece “center-left” and provided “different views”.\n\nAnother piece, reflecting on the history of the KKK in Anaheim, California, included an AI-generated defense of the Klan at the bottom, as the tech journalist Ryan Mac pointed out. It’s since been removed.\n\nI can’t imagine what reader would want to trot around in this silly circle like a horse on a lead line. Most of us can read a viewpoint article and decide, all by ourselves, without a helpful robot, whether we agree.\n\nIn the name of viewpoint diversity – but really to push his paper Trump-ward – Soon-Shiong has done far more harm than good. His bias meter should – quickly – go the way of hot type, the manual typewriter and the dodo.\n\n Margaret Sullivan is a Guardian US columnist writing on media, politics and culture","summary":"The paper’s billionaire owner, who barred it from endorsing Kamala Harris, is leaving human journalists out of the equation\n\nThe past few months have been brutal ones for the readers and journalists of the largest news organization in California, the Los Angeles Times.\n\nSince he bought the paper in 2018, the billionaire and medical entrepreneur Patrick Soon-Shiong has become something of a Donald Trump acolyte.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/mar/05/los-angeles-times-ai-bias-trump","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9900029b9e831a57ab1fcdf152b03e56f7b1c9d0/0_170_5109_3065/master/5109.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3B","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-03-05 12:00:02","author":"Margaret Sullivan","authors":["Margaret Sullivan"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.234}]}
