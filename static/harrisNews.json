If you do not understand that Trump and his movement are fascist, you do not understand fascism. I am writing this in regards to a remarkable dissonance in liberal institutions that speaks to the abject failure of American liberalism to meaningfully respond to this moment.\n\nHere’s my point: if this is fascism, it’s past time to act like it.\n\nLiberalism (centrism in particular) is profoundly vulnerable to fascism, which exploits the notion that all parties should be heard and perspectives debated. Fascists do not concern themselves with truth, reality, contradiction or hypocrisy. They feed off liberalism’s conception of debate and bipartisanship by introducing a reactionary fantasy.\n\nIt gets worse. American liberalism heavily favors centrism, which, in its empty and valueless nature, may constitute a fatal flaw. This flaw is illustrated by the many thought leaders who have gone far beyond just taking seriously fascist ideas all the way to using their platform to advance their perspective and, in some cases, straightforwardly parrot their talking points in a futile attempt to locate a position that appeals to an imaginary “average American.”\n\nIf you are a liberal who cringed at my characterization of liberal institutions, I implore you to consider the following examples I’ve picked out of the bottomless pile.\n\nThe most obvious examples of this strange dissonance surround immigration. Kamala Harris, for instance, called Trump a “fascist” on the campaign trail while running on a “strong border” and calling his border wall, the core of his fascistic political project during his first campaign, a “good idea.”\n\nThe first bill passed during Trump’s second term was the Laken Riley Act, which stripped the undocumented of their right to habeas corpus, which is not only a fundamental human right, but arguably the very foundation of all liberal legal systems. Fifty-eight Democratic legislators (46 in the House, 12 in the Senate) voted for the bill.\n\nDuring the recent protests against largely illegal and entirely morally reprehensible ICE detentions, 75 Democratic lawmakers joined Republicans to “express gratitude” for ICE (a two-decade-old department that is essentially acting as Trump’s Gestapo) and call for greater local and state collaboration.\n\nEven supposedly progressive members of the party try to walk a centrist line by calling for a “bipartisan effort” to “strengthen the border.” All of this is based in pure delusion. There is no “migrant crime wave,” the country is not being “invaded,” President Biden did not “open the borders” (he was almost uniquely restrictive on immigration arguably to the point of violating the internationally recognized right to asylum. That’s another example), and the only “crisis at the border” is humanitarian.\n\nYet to say anything except “we need to strengthen the border” is treated in the majority of American liberal institutions as “naive” because it does not go far enough in capitulating to the utterly hallucinatory politics of a movement we all recognize as fascist.\n\nSo I have a question. Do you believe Trump is a fascist? If you do but you find yourself walking the “middle ground” on his core issues like immigration, LGBTQ rights and policing, it is past time to grow up and ask yourself some hard questions. How do you feel about those who wished to “compromise” with the Nazis’ ideas or condemned forms of resistance they found distasteful? Disgusted, I hope. So, I ask again, do you believe Trump is a fascist?\n\nI have no time or space to attempt to dissuade liberals of centrist positions they may hold on Trump’s core issues. All I have to say is this: your apprehensions about immigrants, trans people, resistance or whatever else do not matter right now. In this moment, capitulation may well mean fascist dictatorship.\n\nFor our vulnerable populations, it may mean annihilation. Right now, defending them is all that matters. Stop doing Trump’s work for him.","summary":"Further capitulation to the administration is not an option.","url":"https://www.centralmaine.com/2025/06/23/threat-of-trump-should-drive-liberals-from-the-middle-ground-opinion/","image":"https://w2pcms.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/06/APTOPIX_Trump_Military_Parade_76764_52308d.jpg?w=1000","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 23:00:18","author":"Roy Tucker","authors":["Roy Tucker"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.101},{"id":334481334,"title":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, joins USC law school faculty","text":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris’ husband, attorney Doug Emhoff, is joining the USC faculty to teach law students, the university plans to announce later Monday. Emhoff, who received his law degree from USC in 1990, will start the job at the USC Gould School of Law on July 1. He taught at Georgetown University’s law school while his wife served as then-President Biden’s vice president and when she was the 2024 Democratic nominee for president. “One of the best parts of my time as Second Gentleman was spending time with these students and young people all around the country — so I look forward to continuing to share my experiences with the next generation and hearing from them in the vibrant academic community at USC,” Emhoff said in a statement. The announcement comes as Harris weighs running for California governor next year, a decision she is not expected to make until the end of the summer. On Monday, she made a surprise virtual appearance at a summit of Free & Just, an organization focused on highlighting the stories of people impacted by the reduction of access to abortion and other reproductive healthcare services. Emhoff said mentoring law students is particularly critical at this time in the nation’s history. “In this difficult moment for the legal community, I believe it is more important than ever to instill in the next generation of lawyers the same principles that drove me to the legal profession: the imperative of speaking out on behalf of the vulnerable, standing up for the rule of law, defending every citizen’s fundamental rights, and always fighting for justice, without fear or favor,” Emhoff said. Emhoff, who lives in Brentwood with Harris, will remain a partner at the global law firm of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, which in April was among the firms that struck a deal with President Trump’s administration agreeing to conform with the president’s policies. The firm agreed to provide at least $100 million in pro bono legal work during Trump’s time in the White House and beyond, which the president said at the time will be dedicated to helping veterans, Gold Star families, law enforcement members and first responders. Emhoff’s continued employment at the firm in the aftermath of the agreement raised eyebrows in progressive circles. He said Monday that he continues to disagree with his firm’s decision to settle with the White House, but remains at the firm because of his faith in his colleagues’ principles, which he said were demonstrated by pro bono work the firm’s attorneys from across the country did during the federal immigration raids by ICE agents and border patrol officers in Los Angeles “I remain confident in the firm’s values, its phenomenal people, and meaningful work we’re doing for our clients and the communities we serve, which have not changed since the settlement—and that’s why I remain at the firm,” Emhoff said. Days after the firm struck the deal, Emhoff said he disagreed with the decision. “At this critical moment, this very critical moment, I urge my colleagues across the legal profession to remain vigilant, engaged, and unafraid to challenge actions that may erode our fundamental rights,” Emhoff said on April 3 at a gala dinner for Bet Tzedek, a Los Angeles-based legal aid organization where he has long volunteered. “Cause we know, the work of justice is never easy, but it is always necessary.”","summary":"As former Vice President Kamala Harris weighs running for governor, her husband, attorney Doug Emhoff, will teach law at USC.","url":"https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2025-06-23/former-vice-president-kamala-harris-husband-joins-usc-law-school-faculty","image":"https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2f188a0/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2422x1272+0+172/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9e%2F6c%2Feb2234ff454689166e54fea1b27f%2Femhoff-covid-95012.j","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 22:04:53","author":"Seema Mehta","authors":["Seema Mehta"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.522},{"id":334476948,"title":"'No Kings': A turning point for the resistance?","text":"SUBSCRIBE & SAVE\n\nLess than $3 per week\n\nView Profile\n\nThe Explainer\n\nTalking Points\n\nThe Week Recommends\n\nNewsletters\n\nFrom the Magazine\n\nThe Week Junior\n\nFood & Drink\n\nPersonal Finance\n\nAll Categories \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\n'No Kings': A turning point for the resistance?\n\nMillions of Americans nationwide took to the streets to protest against the Trump administration \n\nNewsletter sign up\n\nThe \"No Kings\" movement \"may have been the biggest day of demonstrations in American history\"\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe Week US \n\n23 June 2025\n\nThe anti-Trump resistance finally \"has reawakened,\" said Michelle Goldberg in The New York Times. Millions of disgusted Americans poured into the streets across 2,100 cities and towns under the \"No Kings\" banner to protest President Donald Trump's authoritarian administration. Even reliably conservative locales like Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, and the Villages retirement community in Florida saw thousands of demonstrators. With Trump sending in soldiers and Marines to occupy Los Angeles and staging a military parade in Washington, D.C., to honor himself, the weary resignation that followed his re-election is giving way to outrage. \"No Kings\" feels like \"a potential turning point.\" In fact, it \"may have been the biggest day of demonstrations in American history,\" said Will Neal in The Daily Beast. Data journalist G. Elliott Morris estimates 4 to 6 million people came out to show their opposition to Trump's toxic, \"far-right\" policies. Overall, the number of protests and rallies against the Trump administration—15,000 in total—has increased threefold since this same period in 2017. A \"mounting backlash\" against Trump is gathering momentum.\n\nDemocrats may be angry, said Jonathan Turley in The Hill, but their absurd \"democracy is dying\" message has grown stale. It's the same platform that they ran on last November—and lost. In reality, Congress continues to perform its constitutional duties, and \"courts have both ruled in favor of and against the Trump administration.\" Democrats, meanwhile, have no message other than Trump hatred, which is why the party continues to poll terribly. The \"No Kings\" mantra is the Democrats' desperate attempt to implant their frustrated rage in the \"public psyche.\"\n\"The backlash to Trump is real,\" said Steve Benen in MSNBC.com, and special election results prove it. Several days before \"No Kings\" day, Democrat Amanda Clinton won an Oklahoma House seat \"in a 69-point landslide.\" The seat was in a Democratic district that Kamala Harris carried by 19 points, and the 50-point swing surpassed all expectations. Overall, Democrats have over-performed in 29 special elections this year, running 16.4 points ahead of the 2024 election results. Republicans are alarmed, which is why White House communications director Steven Cheung called the massive \"No Kings\" protests \"a complete and utter failure with minuscule attendance.\" When the Trump administration tells \"Americans not to believe their own eyes,\" you know that \"the prevailing political winds\" are changing.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

Joe Biden chaired the panel. \n\nHe pointed to Iran's longstanding 'death to America' slogan, and says Iran 'has been at war with the United States for 46 years' and was 'racing toward a nuclear weapon.'\n\nIn an effort to bring Democrats over the cause, he noted in another post that 'Woodrow Wilson and FDR were both elected on platforms of avoiding war…'\n\nIt was a reference to Trump's 'America first' second inaugural speech where he said 'our power will stop all wars and bring a new spirit of unity to a world that has been angry, violent and totally unpredictable.'\n\nThe speech is getting a new look after Trump ordered attacks on the Houthis in Yemen and the bombing of the Iranian sites. \n\n'I am not a fan of many of Donald Trump‘s actions, but I will speak openly and honestly when he takes bold steps defending America’s interests, as he did tonight,' Metzl posted after Trump's Saturday night speech.\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to the Harris camp for comment.

Such a shame,” Diller wrote.\n\nSources close to Bloomberg, a news tech titan and New York City’s former mayor, said he also is wary of giving to the DNC again, while others have expressed skepticism that hedge-fund manager Marc Lasry is in a hurry to make up the funding.\n\nDuring the 2023-24 election cycle, Bloomberg gave $413,000 to the DNC; Diller donated $330,400; and Lasry contributed $133,400. \n\nLasry hinted that ultimately he will give again to the DNC — but didn’t specify when. A rep for Bloomberg declined to comment.\n\n“There is just a broad consensus that the DNC is ineffectual and not where we should be giving money,” said a longtime former donor.\n\n“But it’s not surprising,” the source said. “‘I don’t belong to an organized party, I’m a Democrat’ is a longtime joke for a reason.\n\n“We’re so decentralized,” the source added. “The DNC has always been a joke. If you are a megadonor looking to shape the direction of the party, don’t give to the DNC. At this point, the shape of the DNC is just embarrassing.”\n\nThe drop-off in fundraising has left some party bosses questioning whether the committee will have to take out loans, though DNC Chairman Ken Martin has expressed doubt that will happen.\n\nA DNC rep said that many long-time donors have already contributed to the DNC this year as part of a record-breaking donation drive in the first four months under Martin.\n\n But another donor who told The Post his wallet is now closed to the committee said Martin may have his head in the sand.\n\n“People are too embarrassed to admit this,” the source said. “I’m a lifelong Dem who raised a ton of money, and I won’t give them a nickel — and I’m not alone.\n\n“I’m not even a Democrat anymore. The Dems should kidnap Elizabeth Warren and take her to Mexico,” the source said of the lefty Massachusetts senator. “This is how Trump got [his win] — not because Trump is loved but because his ideas are popular.”\n\nOther sources pointed out that recent Democratic fundraising has been largely channeled into New York City’s mayoral race, with party leaders increasingly concerned about the prospect of self-described socialist Zohran Mamdani overtaking ex-Gov. Andrew Cuomo in the primary contest.\n\nThe DNC’s most recent financial filings, released last week, revealed that it bled nearly $3 million alone from its already dwindling reserves during the month of May, with the committee’s pot of gold now standing at a precarious $15 million.\n\nShould Mamdani win, that could further erode support for the DNC from big donors who are concerned their money will simply go to socialists, sources noted.\n\nFor its part, the DNC has denied that donor support is wavering. In a statement released Friday, it touted what it called “record fundraising” and the “highest in DNC history under any chair’s first four months” for Martin.\n\nThe DNC told Axios that the nearly $40 million it garnered between February and May of 2025 “surpasses the $37 million raised under Jaime Harrison’s leadership in those same months in 2021.”\n\n“In the early and mid 2010’s, some big-money donors already tried not funding the DNC and state parties, instead funding groups outside of the Party, which hollowed out the critical work that the Party does while putting us behind the eight-ball when it came to critical coordination during the 2016 presidential election,” warned one Democratic strategist.\n\n“We all know how that story ended — Donald Trump won the Presidency and the Democratic Party fell to an all-time low at every level of government. The Democratic Party needs a fully-funded Party to fight Donald Trump.”\n\nThe Republican National Committee, on the other hand, had a net-positive cash flow for May. It added more than $5 million to its treasure trove, bringing its total funds to more than $72 million.\n\nThese new numbers put the RNC’s cash stash at almost five times the size of the DNC’s.

He also claims that its “false advertising and tampering” withheld viewers’ attention from him and his social media platform Truth Social, resulting in a decrease in value for Trump Media and Technology Group and his other media holdings while also violating the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act.\n\nThough Trump’s team has argued that the interview and its promotion on “Face the Nation” are commercial speech, CBS fired back that they provided the court with “nothing that would support the conclusion that the ‘Face the Nation’ and ’60 Minutes’ Broadcasts — involving an interview of a presidential candidate about issues of utmost public concern — are anything but fully protected editorial speech, and they cite not a single case holding that news broadcasts (or promotions for such broadcasts) are commercial speech.”\n\n“Indeed, the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected that argument,” the network added. “The First Amendment applies fully to the news reporting at issue and bars Plaintiffs’ claims.”\n\nCBS also stated that Trump lacks standing because he cannot rely on “intangible harms” that are “common to the public at large” and that accepting it would “amount to greenlighting thousands of consumer claims brought by individuals who merely disagree with a news organizations’ editorial choices.”\n\n“President Trump has not plausibly alleged that he personally suffered ‘an injury to a commercial interest in reputation or sales,’” they added.\n\nIn a second filing, also obtained by TheWrap, CBS argued that a case about an interview that was filmed in Washington, D.C., and broadcast from New York City does not belong in Texas federal court.\n\n“Plaintiffs do not dispute that the filming, editing and production work for the challenged Interview took place nearly 2,000 miles from this courthouse. They do not dispute that the Interview never referenced this state. And they do not dispute that the people most knowledgeable about the Interview all worked in New York or Washington, D.C.,” the network’s attorneys wrote. “President Trump and Representative Jackson do not even allege that they watched the ‘FTN’ or ’60 Minutes’ Broadcasts from Texas when they aired. In short, there is no basis for jurisdiction or venue in this Court.”\n\nThey further urged that the case be dismissed or transferred to the Southern District of New York. The judge currently overseeing the case is Matthew J. Kacsmaryk, a Trump appointee who has previously sided with right-leaning groups on cases related to abortion and LGBTQ rights.\n\nThe high stakes legal battle comes as Paramount’s pending $8 billion merger with Skydance Media awaits regulatory approval from the FCC due to a required transfer of broadcast licenses of the media giant’s 28 owned-and-operated local TV stations. The deal, which executives have said would close in the first half of 2025, recently triggered its first automatic 90-day extension after failing to close by April 7.\n\nIf the merger is not closed by the time that extension expires next month, it would automatically be pushed another 90 days into October. After that, if the deal is still not closed, the FCC blocks the merger or one of the parties involved breaches the terms of the agreement, then Skydance and Paramount will have the option of terminating the deal.\n\nWhen asked by reporters last week whether he sees the agency’s review being resolved soon, Trump replied: “I hope so. Ellison’s great, he’ll do a great job with it.” But he also took the opportunity to blast CBS for the Harris interview.\n\n“What they did was they interviewed Kamala, her answer was horrendous, I would say election-threatening,” he said. “They took the entire answer out, and they took another answer from another question and put it in. And they did that, I understand, a number of times … We caught ’em, and they are very embarrassed by it, and they are working on a settlement now.”\n\nDemocratic Sens. Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and Ron Wyden issued a warning to Paramount’s controlling shareholder Shari Redstone last month that reaching a settlement in exchange for regulatory approval could violate federal anti-bribery laws. The California State Senate has also launched an investigation into the matter and invited former “60 Minutes” executive producer Bill Owens and former CBS News president Wendy McMahon to testify.\n\nFCC chairman Brendan Carr has argued that the settlement talks with Trump are unrelated to the agency’s review of the Skydance deal. But he has warned that “all options remain on the table” in the agency’s ongoing investigation into alleged “news distortion” related to the Harris interview, including potentially revoking CBS’ broadcast license if the network is found to have violated the agency’s public interest standard. \n\nParamount’s settlement talks come as Disney previously paid $15 million to settle a defamation lawsuit Donald Trump brought against ABC News and star anchor George Stephanopoulos. Meta also paid $25 million to settle Trump’s lawsuit about being kicked off Facebook and Instagram after the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.","summary":"In a new court filing, the network argues that its \"60 Minutes\" Kamala Harris interview is \"fully protected editorial speech\" \n\n\nThe post CBS Blasts Trump&#8217;s $20 Billion Lawsuit as &#8216;Meritless&#8217; Attempt to &#8216;Evade Bedrock First Amendment Principles&#8217; appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/cbs-blasts-meritless-trump-lawsuit-court-filing/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Donald-Trump-Shari-Redstone.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 19:39:08","author":"Lucas Manfredi","authors":["Lucas Manfredi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.351},{"id":334452256,"title":"Provisions of ‘Big, Beautiful Bill’ Get Scrubbing in Senate in Parliamentarian’s ‘Byrd’ Bath","text":"A number of provisions of the House’s Big Beautiful Bill Act—the main legislative vehicle for fulfilling President Donald Trump’s campaign promises—have been thrown out in recent days, complicating Republicans’ efforts to pass the 10-year fiscal framework before Independence Day on July 4.\n\nSenate Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough—essentially the Senate referee—decides on whether or not provisions in the budget reconciliation process follow Senate rules.\n\nIn such cases, she is invoking the “Byrd rule,” which is meant to restrict the process to budgetary policy only. The rule is named for then-Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was the rule’s main sponsor when it was adopted in 1985.\n\nThere are a few reasons a parliamentarian might to toss a provision under the Byrd rule: if it does not produce a change in spending or savings that is more than “merely incidental”; if it is not in compliance with budgetary instructions; if it increases deficits beyond the 10-year window; if it is outside a committee’s jurisdiction; or if it affects Social Security.\n\nIn order to overcome such overruling, Republicans would have to get 60 votes to overturn each ruling, per Senate custom. That’s very unlikely given the current partisan divide in the Senate, where Republicans hold 53 of the 100 seats.\n\nHere‘s how the bill has been changed in recent days.\n\nFood Stamps\n\nMacDonough has thrown out some of the reforms to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides food stamps to millions of Americans.\n\nSpecifically, the parliamentarian has struck provisions that would have barred noncitizens from accessing food stamps and would have forced states to share a larger amount of the cost of the program if they have a higher payment error rate. \n\nThose amount to a gutting of the House and Senate agriculture committees’ work on the bill and will do damage to the overall spending reductions of the bill. \n\nState Border Enforcement\n\nAnother provision on the chopping block was “state and local assistance”—authorizing states to assist the federal government in carrying out immigration enforcement.\n\n“This subsection authorizes states to conduct border security and immigration enforcement, which are federal functions,” write Senate Budget Committee Democrats in their outline of the Byrd rule casualties. \n\nBeyond precluding the federal government from saving money on these operations, the parliamentarian’s ruling also deals a blow to the bill’s work to help fulfill Trump’s promises on border security. \n\nSelling Off Postal Service EVs\n\nSlashed from the bill is a provision that “mandates the sale of all the United States Postal Service’s electric vehicles and infrastructure to support its electric vehicles.”\n\nWhile perhaps not a massive setback for congressional Republicans, it means that this element of former President Joe Biden’s presidency will live on.\n\nIs a Parliamentarian’s Ruling Final?\n\nThe Senate parliamentarian’s rulings are something of a setback to Republicans, but they are not necessarily final. A simple option is to amend and resubmit the provision so that the parliamentarian no longer considers it in violation.\n\nThe Senate can also motion to waive the parliamentarian’s ruling, which requires 60 votes—an unlikely outcome given Republicans’ 53-seat majority and Democrats’ unanimous opposition to the bill.\n\nThere is also the option of having the presiding officer of the Senate—Vice President JD Vance—choose to ignore the parliamentarian’s rulings. This would send an earthquake through Washington and shatter precedent.\n\nFor context, back in 2021, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., urged Vice President Kamala Harris to overrule MacDonough’s striking a $15 minimum wage provision in the American Rescue Act, a reconciliation package.\n\n“I’m sorry—an unelected parliamentarian does not get to deprive 32 million Americans the raise they deserve,” Khanna said in 2021. “This is an advisory, not a ruling. VP Harris needs to disregard and rule a $15 minimum wage in order.” Harris ultimately did not pursue this.\n\nThere is also the option of removing a parliamentarian, which then-Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., did with then-Parliamentarian Robert Dove in 2001.\n\nThese latter two options are extremely unlikely, but they are in the Republicans’ toolbox if they consider MacDonough’s rulings do considerable damage to the main legislative vehicle for enacting Trump’s agenda.","summary":"A number of provisions of the House’s Big Beautiful Bill Act—the main legislative vehicle for fulfilling President Donald Trump’s campaign promises—have been thrown out in...

The attack was absolutely the right call in the eyes of Sen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania, but an immediately impeachable offense to the ear of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez of New York. Probably the right call, in the estimation of Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, but it would have been better with Congressional sign-off. The Let’s Wait And See Caucus is being led by Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticut even as he also questions if the attack was even constitutional.\n\nIt all lays bare how, a decade on, Democrats still are at a complete loss for how to tackle the most powerful Republican in the nation.\n\nThe fact that Israel is involved complicates their calculus tenfold. Jewish voters, although a tiny sliver of the electorate, are among the most loyal base for the Democratic Party. (Last year, 78% of Jewish voters cast their ballots for Kamala Harris.) Support for Israel—though not necessarily its government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu—has long been a cornerstone of the party’s political worldview. But an outpouring of sympathy for the Palestinians, under attack from Israel after Hamas’ brazen attack in 2023, has shaken some of that footing, especially with younger Democrats and the progressive Left. And Trump’s targeting of college campuses for being havens of antisemitism has caused a backlash from liberals who might despise that strain of hatred, but find Trump equally as loathsome.","summary":"AOC, Chuck Schumer, and John Fetterman are at odds","url":"https://time.com/7296889/iran-attack-democrat-aoc-trump/","image":"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2214937319.jpg?quality=85&w=1024&h=628&crop=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 19:07:27","author":"Philip Elliott","authors":["Philip Elliott"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":334425834,"title":"Democrat Edges Republican Incumbent in New Iowa Poll","text":"Democrat Christina Bohannan held a lead over Republican Representative Mariannette Miller-Meeks in a new Democratic-sponsored poll of Iowa's First Congressional District, according to Politico.Why It MattersBohannan nearly unseated Miller-Meeks in 2024, losing by only 799 votes despite President Donald Trump carrying the district by more than 8 percentage points. It was among the closest races and went to a recount. Bohannan announced last week she is taking on Miller-Meeks for a third time in hopes of flipping the seat in the 2026 midterms.The election will likely become one of the most competitive races as Democrats aim to regain control of the House, particularly if Trump's falling approval rating fuels a 2018-style \"blue wave.\"What To KnowPolitico reported a new poll of the district showing Bohannan with an early lead over the incumbent Republican. The internal poll was conducted by Public Policy Polling and commissioned by the House Majority PAC.Bohannan received 43 percent support to 39 percent for Miller-Meeks, while 18 percent were undecided.Bohannan told Newsweek that the poll is a \"reflection of what we are seeing in the district.\"\"Hundreds of people reached out to me asking me to run again. That's why we launched our campaign last week,\" Bohannan said. \"People are very fed up with what they are seeing with Representative Miller-Meeks and what's happening in Washington, D.C. She has voted three times to protect the tariffs that are hurting Iowa's farmers and hurting everyday people with increasing the cost of everything from groceries to lumber.\"Internal polls are sometimes viewed as less reliable than independent polls, as they are typically selectively released by those who sponsor them. No independent polls have been conducted for the race, but analysts view the district as a toss-up. The poll surveyed 555 voters in the district from June 18-19, Politico reported.Newsweek also reached out to Miller-Meeks' campaign via email for comment.Bohannan's campaign wrote in a press statement last week that her campaign raised more than $500,000 in the first day after launching her run, underscoring how competitive the race may be.The district includes much of the southeast areas of Iowa, ranging from Des Moines suburbs to Davenport and Iowa City, as well as much of the rural areas across the region. It's illustrative of the sort of rural district Democrats once did well in but have struggled in recent elections.Democrats view Bohannan as a strong recruit, pointing to her strong showing in the district compared to former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024. They are hoping that performance, along with a more favorable national environment, could propel her to victory next November.What People Are SayingKatarina Flicker, House Majority PAC press secretary, on X, formerly Twitter: \"NEW POLLING commissioned by @HouseMajPAC finds Dem candidate Christina Bohannan leading GOP Rep.

Fox News Digital reached out to Harris' office regarding Metzl's post, but did not immediately receive a reply.

Thomas Massie, have slammed Trump over the strikes, arguing they bypassed Congress. FETTERMAN BACKS TRUMP AFTER IRAN STRIKES: 'THE CORRECT MOVE' Trump announced the Saturday evening strikes on Iran in a Truth Social post that was not preceded by media leaks or speculation that strikes were imminent. The unexpected social media post was followed just hours later by a brief Trump address to the nation while flanked by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Vice President JD Vance. \"A short time ago, the U.S. military carried out massive precision strikes on the three key nuclear facilities in the Iranian regime: Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan,\" Trump said from the White House late on Saturday in an address to the nation regarding the strikes. \"Everybody heard those names for years as they built this horribly destructive enterprise. Our objective was the destruction of Iran's nuclear enrichment capacity, and a stop to the nuclear threat posed by the world's No. 1 state sponsor of terror. Tonight, I can report to the world that the strikes were a spectacular military success.\" The strikes \"obliterated\" Iranian nuclear facilities and backed the nation into a corner to make a peace deal, Trump said. This mission was also celebrated by Hegseth and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Dan Caine as one that was cloaked in secrecy and intentionally deceptive to confuse the enemy. \"It involved misdirection and the highest of operational security.

But with 31 months to go before the Iowa caucuses, there is ample time for events to reshape this perception. Inherent disadvantages for vice presidents seeking their party’s nomination after a two-term presidency, shifting party fault lines, and unpredictable political storms on the horizon all complicate his path to the 2028 GOP nomination.\n\nDespite real strengths that cement his early position, crowning Vance as the heir to MAGA this far out is premature. \n\nVance’s strengths\n\nFrom 30,000 feet, the fundamentals look good for a Vance 2028 nomination bid as of today. \n\nHistory shows that a winning GOP primary campaign should hope to garner at least 45% of the primary electorate. That number, earned by President Donald Trump in 2016, marks the lowest total won during a contested primary of the past 50 years.\n\nAccording to an Economist-YouGov survey conducted between May 9 and 12, Vance is viewed favorably by 77% of Republicans, with 51% viewing Vance “very favorably.”\n\nCrucially, Vance is viewed as a Trump loyalist, and in turn, the MAGA base, which is now the GOP base, appears loyal to him. Vance has embraced Trump’s worldview and style, and thus far, their political partnership has been harmonious, with little daylight appearing between the two in public. \n\nThe only possible moment of incongruity came when the infamous Signal chat emerged, in which Vance had criticized the strikes in Yemen, saying, “I think we are making a mistake,” and, “I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now.” White House deputy chief of staff for policy Stephen Miller was seen as putting the vice president in his place, writing, “As I heard it, the president was clear.”\n\nBut for the MAGA base, including its most prominent influencers, the incident only deepened their affection for Vance, who they view as a bulwark against neoconservative influence within the administration. \n\nVance’s support among MAGA influencers is unwavering. Tucker Carlson, speaking at a Heritage Foundation event, described Vance as “the future. Period. … JD Vance is the best I’ve ever met. He’s the combination of intelligence, decency, wisdom, emotional self-control.” Influential MAGA darling Laura Loomer recently predicted a Vance-Trump Jr. ticket for 2028. And influencer Jack Posobiec of Pizzagate fame frequently refers to Vance as “48” and sells T-shirts with Vance’s face on them. (Vance appears to return the affection, having blurbed Posobiec’s latest book.)\n\nThe large, engaged audiences of these New Right media figures make their endorsements critical in GOP primaries.\n\nVance is also a media machine unto himself. Since stepping onto the national stage last year, no Republican figure, including Trump, has delivered more powerful media moments of the “own the libs” variety than Vance. His rebuke of CBS News’s Margaret Brennan, which included the now-famous quip, “I don’t really care, Margaret,” in response to her criticism of the Trump administration’s pause of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, went super viral on X and drew over 1.7 million views on YouTube within 24 hours. \n\nVance’s exceptional “memeability,” underscored by the endless images shared daily of edited versions of Vance’s face superimposed on other bodies, is a powerful attribute in the social media age. Like his boss, Vance has proven able to harness the internet’s chaotic energy, riding the wave of the zeitgeist to cement his place as a cultural and political lightning rod.\n\nMeanwhile, his often blunt and polarizing sound bites are the perfect online fodder for the highly engaged Republican voters. His bond with the famously tempestuous MAGA faithful seems only to deepen with time, an accomplishment of which only a few beyond the Trump family can boast. \n\nVance’s ability to dominate debates is another strength in a primary process heavily influenced by debate performances. Though his debate resume is limited — the only two of his short political career are his 2022 Senate debate with former Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan and his 2024 vice presidential debate against Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) — his commanding performances in both suggest a mastery of the format. His showing against Walz impressed so much that commentators speculated at the time that the field for 2028 might already be cleared. \n\nCauses for concern\n\nFor all of these formidable strengths, a Vance bid for the GOP nomination faces significant obstacles. \n\nVice presidents generally have had a difficult time securing their party’s nomination. Not counting former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was given the nomination without a vote, and former President Joe Biden, whose run came four years after leaving office, only three sitting vice presidents have become their party’s subsequent standard-bearer in the past 50 years: Walter Mondale, George H.W. Bush, and Al Gore — a group that only produced one general election winner. \n\nThe reasons vice presidents struggle here are manifold. For one, they are saddled with the record and popular approval of the outgoing president, and in the modern era, administrations tend to end with a whimper, not a bang. One exception is former President Bill Clinton, who, aided by an overzealous impeachment effort by Republicans and a resilient economy, saw his popularity rise in the waning days of his presidency. This aided Gore’s effort to fend off a strong primary challenge from Bill Bradley. The electorate, including primary voters, is often hungry for change after two full terms of a presidency. George H.W. Bush’s successful bid following his stint as Ronald Reagan’s vice president is the exception, not the rule.\n\nWhether Trump’s second term will end on a soaring note or a nadir will largely be determined by the state of the economy. The tumultuous nature of Trump’s tariff war makes it difficult to forecast. Vance’s fortunes will be tied to the trade war’s outcomes, and perhaps explicitly with whispers that Trump is considering Vance to become the administration’s “tariff czar.” Such an appointment would carry the ultimate boom or bust potential for a 2028 run at the White House.\n\nNumerous other unknowns color the coming primary battle. While Vance appears to have the support of the extremely loyal MAGA base, there is plenty of time for Trump and Vance’s relationship to go south. High-profile relationships with Trump end poorly more often than not, with Elon Musk as the latest example.\n\nVance accusing Trump of ignorance in the Signal chat is an isolated incident insofar as we know. History shows that it doesn’t take much for a Trump insider to become a Trump pariah. \n\nTo be sure, Vance’s standing within the MAGA movement remains entirely in Trump’s hands. It is inconceivable that anyone of whom Trump disapproves could win the 2028 nomination. Friction could emerge between the two on numerous issues. Trump’s sudden reversal on deporting farm and restaurant workers contrasts sharply with the immigration priorities of Vance’s New Right backers, who emphasize the notion that illegal labor drives down wages for American workers in low-skill sectors. \n\nThe president’s spat with Carlson over the definition of “America First” foreign policy in relation to Israel’s war with Iran presents another possible point of conflict between Trump and Vance. Carlson fumed at Israel’s strike and blasted the U.S. as “complicit in the act of war” that contradicts the movement’s isolationist stance. Trump countered by telling the Atlantic that the “America First” movement isn’t a fixed set of ideas but whatever Trump wants it to be. \n\n“Well, considering that I’m the one that developed ‘America First,’ and considering that the term wasn’t used until I came along, I think I’m the one that decides that,” he said. \n\nThe issue of life is another area for possible disagreement. Since being tapped as Trump’s vice president, Vance, once a stalwart anti-abortion senator, has adapted his views on access to mifepristone and a national abortion ban. But a primary that includes anti-abortion challengers would force him to break with the president or defend the administration’s spotty pro-life record. Both options come with their own set of political risks.\n\nSo far, Vance appears to enjoy broad support among the pro-life movement’s leaders despite embracing views that run counter to the cause. Vance’s public vow to maintain access to the abortion pill and his active promotion of in vitro fertilization, both positions that conflict sharply with the Catholic Church and the broader pro-life movement, could open the door for a pro-life primary challenger to siphon off votes.\n\nVance’s relative youth and political inexperience also raise questions about his inevitability. Vance, whose national political career is only a few years old, has only run two races against deeply flawed opponents: Ryan and Harris-Walz. A primary battle against a Republican heavyweight, such as Secretary of State Marco Rubio or Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, would easily be his most difficult political test. It’s unclear how Vance would hold up during the lengthy primary process against robust competition. \n\nVance’s brand of politics is another area of concern. His obvious intellectual capabilities draw rave reviews from the post-liberal intelligentsia. But his severe demeanor, seen in intense exchanges on social media and in interviews with mainstream journalists, may alienate voters beyond his online base.\n\nAn indispensable aspect of Trump’s political effectiveness is his sense of humor and ability to connect with ordinary people. For every rage-filled, all-caps Truth Social post, there’s a genuinely hilarious joke at a MAGA rally or a photo shoot hanging from a McDonald’s window. Vance has not demonstrated the ability to shift gears in this way. It’s one thing to be an impressive intellect and another altogether to be liked. People like Trump. The jury is still out on Vance. \n\nIt’s also unclear what will become of the GOP primary electorate post-Trump. Will MAGA factionalize once its founding father steps off the stage? Will Vance’s high unfavorable ratings — as of today, the RealClearPolitics polling average has Vance’s approval rating at 42% and his disapproval at 45% — enable a primary opponent to argue credibly that he isn’t the party’s best general election nominee? Would the prospect of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) as president worry enough primary voters to take this concern seriously? \n\nTrump himself believes the race is wide open.\n\nDEMOCRATS NEED ANOTHER SISTER SOULJAH MOMENT \n\n“You look at Marco, you look at JD Vance, who’s fantastic,” Trump told Kristen Welker on Meet the Press. “You look at — I could name 10, 15, 20 people right now just sitting here.”\n\nVance is likely the front-runner as of now, but with years of uncertainty ahead, Banks’s prediction is hasty.

This is what the western left could learn from him | Owen Jones","text":"The Zohran Mamdani phenomenon should not be happening, if received wisdom is a reliable predictor of events. He’s the 33-year-old Muslim leftist and Queens assemblyman running for the New York mayoralty with the support of the Democratic Socialists of America, and the vitriolic campaign against him suggests his momentum has caused panic in gilded circles. His chief opponent for the Democratic nomination, Andrew Cuomo, could not scream party establishment more loudly: he’s New York state’s former governor – just like his father was – and a former cabinet secretary. He married into that classic Democratic royalty, the Kennedys; his endorsements include the former president Bill Clinton; and billionaires such as Mike Bloomberg are pouring millions into his Super Pac.\n\nIn another age, someone like Mamdani would have been a no-hoper. What changed was the 2016 presidential campaign of the long-marginalised socialist senator Bernie Sanders, which re-energised the US left. But Donald Trump’s recent victory on a more extreme platform led to predictions of a general rightwing lurch in US politics, with progressive positions scapegoated for the Democratic loss (even though Kamala Harris ran on a squarely corporate, “centrist” ticket). I was scheduled to interview Mamdani on the night of the US presidential election, but his campaign asked to postpone as results started to come in suggesting a Trump victory was likely. Presumably, they wanted to reassess strategy in the coming US political winter.\n\nBut just a few months later, Mamdani is surging, and his campaign offers lessons for the western left in an age of chronic economic insecurity, rising far-right authoritarianism, war and genocide. The primary election vote is tomorrow, but a poll released during crucial early voting shows Mamdani overtaking Cuomo in “ranked choice” voting: it’s within the margin of error, but five months ago the insurgent candidate was polling only 1% support. In only a month, Mamdani has leapt from 22% to 32%, particularly powered by a 2:1 lead among the under-50s.\n\nYes, the millennial has been helped by Cuomo’s chronic liabilities – the former governor resigned in disgrace after an investigation by the state attorney general found that he had sexually harrassed several women – but rival candidates with bigger profiles and more political experience could have gained from that instead. The New York Times pleaded with readers not to rank Mamdani in the preferential voting system, rich New Yorkers are threatening to flee the city if he wins, he’s been attacked for inexperience, and smeared over his championing of Palestinian rights. “Zohran Mamdani is a public menace,” screeches rightwing magazine the National Review.\n\nSo what’s the universal lessons for the western left? Three Ms are key: messaging, medium and movement. Grace Mausser is the co-chair of New York City Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). When I suggested that Mamdani’s campaign would surely originally have been driven by revitalising the left, rather than the prospect of an actual election victory, she disagrees.\n\n“When we started, we knew the path to victory was narrow,” she conceded. But, she emphasised: “We don’t run races for purely moral reasons or to make a point like the Green party in the US which has failed in their project.” Indeed, the DSA played a pivotal role in Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s shock defeat of another Democratic luminary, the former chair of the House Democratic Caucus Joe Crowley back in 2018. In turn, Ocasio-Cortez has bolstered Mamdani with her endorsement, underlining how progressive victories feed off one another.\n\n“Super-clear messaging” is how Mausser sums up the Mamdani strategy. The early campaign settled on three main messages: “Fast and free buses, freeze the rents, free childcare. That’s so easy to remember. People know it, and it’s said over and over and over again.” Mamdani has other pledges, too – such as launching publicly run grocery stores – but key to his success are core, endlessly repeated commitments focused on a cost of living crisis triggered by a broken economic system.\n\nThis strategy is essential in combating a “culture war” designed to force leftists into a defensive posture. It doesn’t mean abandoning marginalised minorities – Mamdani has unequivocally committed to transgender rights, for example. It just means emphasising unifying economic messages. Anger is redirected from the disenfranchised to thriving economic elites, whom Mamdani seeks to tax to fulfil his pledges. The campaign has settled, too, on not backing down to bad faith attacks: Mamdani has not given an inch in his pro-Palestinian advocacy.\n\nThen there’s the medium. What Mausser calls “high-quality video production” has been pivotal. Across the west, the far right has proven adept at using platforms such as TikTok to radicalise supporters, with the left mostly not even playing catch-up. Mamdani’s campaign made slick videos that are witty, sassy and snappy, communicating its messages to wide audiences. “All the conversations after the election [were] about needing a ‘Joe Rogan of the left’, how people aren’t getting their news from traditional media, how they’re getting their news from TikTok, Instagram and YouTube,” says Democratic strategist Waleed Shahid. “And that is exactly the story of Zohran.”\n\nWhen Sanders endorsed Mamdani, he declared how he was “very impressed by the grassroots movement that he has put together”. Mamdani’s campaign has an army of door-knockers, often visiting districts traditionally ignored by Democratic machine politicians. For many of these canvassers, this is their first political experience. Mausser reports: “If you ask them, ‘How did you hear about Zohran?’, it’s like: ‘Oh, I saw his video on Instagram or TikTok.’” The message and the medium raised an army. There’s another factor, too: Mamdani, like Ocasio-Cortez, is charismatic and telegenic. It’s not fashionable to discuss this on a left which prioritises the collective over the individual, but we need compelling communicators who look the part.\n\nMamdani may not win the Democratic nomination. Even if he does, Cuomo will stand as an independent candidate, although the socialist challenger may do this, too. His campaign’s weaknesses reflect those of the wider US left: too little inroads among Black and older voters, as well as those with little online political engagement. But Mamdani’s against-the-odds success underlines why the far-right surge doesn’t have to weaken the left – far from it. Indeed, Mamdani positions himself as best-placed to resist Trump, rather than kowtow to his agenda. When the Republicans won, one of Mamdani’s first viral videos was visiting local districts where Trump enjoyed his biggest swings.\n\nWhatever happens, Mamdani shows that the US left lives on after what Shahid calls “a shitty year”: along with Trump’s triumph, there have been dispiriting primary defeats of progressive representatives Jamaal Bowman and Cori Bush at the hands of notorious pro-Israel lobbyists Aipac. Mamdani has built a movement in New York, but his campaign has also given a shellshocked western left a gift: a strategy to take on the establishment even in adverse circumstances.\n\n Owen Jones is a Guardian columnist","summary":"He has used clear messaging to redirect anger from the disenfranchised to the economic elites.

The pair eventually married, becoming partners in life as well as music and setting the stage for what would become the now invincible husband-and-wife duo behind The War and Treaty. They perform this weekend in Tinley Park, opening for singer-songwriter Chris Stapleton.\n\n“[Michael] really sparked something in me when I saw him perform. There was a level of passion that I, as an artist, no longer had,” Tanya Trotter confessed in a recent interview from the couple’s now-adopted home of Nashville. They live there now with four children, some of whom take part in the family business, including a daughter who works as the band’s merch manager and their youngest son whom they describe as their biggest critic. (Tanya also has roots in Chicago including a grandmother who once lived in Oak Park and several cousins that still call the city home.)\n\n“When I saw [Michael’s] passion, I was just overwhelmed by the talent but also the lyrics to the songs that I heard,” Tanya added. “I had to connect with him, not just musically, but as a human being. You really can’t write that deep and not be in touch with your own humanity, you know?”\n\nIt’s a gift Michael found in the most difficult of times, while in combat in Iraq, Remarkably, he taught himself how to play music on Saddam Hussein’s personal piano as his unit was stationed in one of the dictator’s palaces. The first song he ever played on the instrument was “Lean on Me” by Bill Withers.\n\n“I think that those worlds [music and war] meet where there’s tragedy. And I found tranquility and tragedy through music,” Michael said.. With Tanya, it’s one of the themes the pair has explored with incredible conviction on songs such as the harrowing “Five More Minutes,” released in 2020, detailing a time when, at the height of his PTSD battle, Michael thought of ending his life.\n\nTo date, the Trotters have released five albums (the most recent, “Plus One,” appropriately launched this past Valentine’s Day), all tied by a sound representative of the American diaspora, one that’s a little bit country and a whole lot of soul, gospel and folk. It’s a mix heard on the gripping early work “Down to the River” all the way through to their latest harmonizer, “Feels Like Home.”\n\nAnd from nearly the beginning, The War and Treaty has been heralded by all corners of the music industry, leading the couple to lay stake at the hallowed Grand Ole Opry on multiple occasions, while receiving co-signs from artists like Emmylou Harris, Billy Strings, the Rolling Stones and Stapleton. They have become the first Black duo ever nominated for country music’s esteemed ACM and CMA Awards at a time that the genre grapples with inclusivity.\n\nThe Trotters have not been immune to the backlash that fellow Black artists such as Beyoncé have faced, the latter when releasing “Cowboy Carter” in 2024. For the Trotters, that vitriol especially picked up last year when they teamed with Bon Jovi on the song “The People’s House,” endorsing then-presidential candidate Kamala Harris.\n\n“That’s what this is all about though. If we are the land of the free and the home of the brave, then see me. Allow me to freely create what I want to create,” said Michael. “Nobody told Morgan Wallen that he can’t mix R&B with country because he’s white.”\n\nStill, Michael added, “We get those comments … from ignorant people that claim to be country music fans. And they’re just fans of their own disdain. Anybody who is pure and wants to do some good, there’s always going to be a group of haters. But I believe that we’re doing a good job and just being authentically who we are. And that’s just the truth about it.”\n\n“But I think that’s the beautiful thing about being an artist,” added Tanya. “You find your tribe.”\n\nIf the Trotters’ journey sounds like something you might see in the movies, well, it soon will be. A biopic has been in the works for six years now, led by John Legend’s Get Lifted Films and “La La Land” producer Gary Gilbert, with Recording Academy CEO Harvey Mason Jr. acting as music supervisor.

American officials have long been concerned that Iran was working to develop nuclear weapons, that Iranian officials say its program is only focused on energy production.Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard testified in March that Iran was not working on developing a nuclear weapon.The strikes divided Americans, as polls suggest many are skeptical of the U.S. becoming involved in the conflict. Both Democrats and Republicans raised concerns about Trump not seeking congressional authority for the strikes and whether it could endanger American troops and civilians in the region. Others supported the strikes as a means to prevent Iran from having nuclear capabilities.What To KnowSome Trump critics have supported the strikes. This includes both more traditional conservatives who broke with Trump over issues like the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol or his approach to other global affairs like the Russia-Ukraine war, as well as Democrats who have cast themselves as close allies to Iran.Former Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois is among those anti-Trump Republicans who have supported the move. Kinzinger broke with Trump over the January 6 riot. Kinzinger supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election over Trump.In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Kinzinger called the strikes a \"good call by the President.\"\"The US attack on the nuclear facilities is, in my opinion, the right call. We will see what the results are, but now the key is suppressing surface to surface missile fire, and then negotiate to end the fight with Iran,\" he wrote.In another post, he wrote that the military \"should be used to compel diplomatic action,\" and that a \"nuclear armed Iran would have been unacceptable.\"John Bolton, Trump's former national security adviser turned critic, backed the strikes in remarks on CNN.\"I think President Trump made the right decision for America to attack Iran's nuclear weapons program, and I think we're on the verge of potentially seeing regime change in Iran as part of that,\" Bolton said. \"This is a huge change in the Middle East. Decisive action is the right thing to do. I thought somebody should do it for a long time, but better late than never.\"Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who challenged Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, said Trump deserves an \"enormous amount of credit\" for the strikes during an interview on ABC News.\"This is against type for him. I'm sure it was a difficult decision. I think his analysis was, he cannot live with a nuclear weapon in Iran, and Israel did all of the heavy lifting,\" he said.Ex-GOP Governor Raises 'Great Doubts' About Trump's Iran Strikes to NewsweekSome Republican critics raised concerns about the strikes.Christine Todd Whitman, the former Republican governor of New Jersey who has been sharply critical of the party's shift toward Trump, told Newsweek she has \"great doubts\" about the decision.\"I think we all agree that Iran shouldn't have a nuclear weapon and I have to bow to intelligence reports that purportedly said they were within in a week or two of making that a reality,\" she said. \"I can only hope that the intelligence is correct, but since this president doesn't seem to listen to his intelligence chief I have great doubts and wish he had pursued the disarmament talks further.\"She noted that the strikes \"should not have come as a surprise to Congress,\" and that it could \"galvanize them to finally take back some of the powers they have ceded to the president.\"Some Democrats Back Iran StrikesSome Democratic Trump critics also voiced some support for the move.Representative Jared Moskowitz of Florida wrote in a series of posts on X that the strike appeared to be targeted to \"defend the U.S., Israel, and allies throughout the region and the world.\"\"I've always held that Iran cannot be allowed to develop a nuclear weapon. That has been US policy throughout Democratic and Republican Administrations, and it is my hope that Iran no longer has the capabilities to continue its nuclear program. The world would be a safer place,\" he wrote.Representative Steny Hoyer of Maryland said the strikes were \"essential to preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.\" Still, he said the threat of Iran developing a nuclear weapon became \"dire\" due to the Trump administration's decision to end the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2018.\"Every American president since Jimmy Carter, regardless of party, as well as multiple generations of both Democratic and Republican leadership in Congress, articulated the bipartisan policy that allowing Iran to develop nuclear weapons was unacceptable,\" he wrote.What People Are SayingSenator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican and Trump critic, on X: \"President Trump's decision to carry out focused strikes on Iran's nuclear infrastructure makes clear that the international community will not tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran. I commend all those who executed this mission with precision and professionalism.\"Representative Thomas Massie, a Kentucky Republican who has been critical of the strikes, on X: \"This is not America First folks.\"Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, criticized the strikes on X: \"The President's disastrous decision to bomb Iran without authorization is a grave violation of the Constitution and Congressional War Powers. He has impulsively risked launching a war that may ensnare us for generations. It is absolutely and clearly grounds for impeachment.\"What Happens NextIran has pledged retaliation for the strikes, and cities across the United States are preparing for the potential consequences. The conflict could have significant impacts for millions of people living in the region, as well as economic impacts that could reverberate back to the U.S.","summary":"Trump critics like former GOP Representative Adam Kinzinger have offered the president praise over the Iran strikes.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-critics-defend-iran-strikes-2089403","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2669032/donald-trump-critics-defend-iran-strikes.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 16:28:12","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.208},{"id":334410714,"title":"Former Harris Lawyer Now Works for a President She Called ‘Unfit to Hold Office’","text":"A lawyer who worked for Kamala Harris’ Senate office and President Joe Biden’s National Security Council now works in President Donald Trump’s administration as an ostensibly non-political staffer in the Department of Defense, even though she wrote an op-ed calling Trump “unfit to hold office.”\n\nWhile presidents appoint more than 3,000 people for political positions, the federal government directly employs roughly 2.3 million people, most of whom serve in ostensibly nonpolitical, career positions. The Office of Personnel Management tracks when political appointees transition to career positions—a process often referred to as “burrowing in” to the bureaucracy—and Samantha Goldstein did so in 2023.\n\nGoldstein went from senior counsel at the Office of Legal Policy in the Department of Justice to attorney-advisor at the Office of Legal Counsel in the DOJ. \n\nOPM approved her move on Jan. 15, 2023. Goldstein received a pay bump from $110,460 annually to $127,942 annually. \n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Goldstein left the DOJ in July 2024 to serve as deputy legal advisor on Biden’s National Security Council until February, when she joined the Department of Defense as associate deputy general counsel. \n\nGoldstein graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 2013, and clerked for two U.S. appeals courts: the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. She interned with the left-leaning NAACP Legal Defense Fund in 2016 and served as a special counsel for Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in 2018. Between these two positions and before she joined the Justice Department, Goldstein worked at the firm O’Melveny & Myers. Legistorm confirms this history.\n\nDuring her second stint at O’Melveny, Goldstein wrote a Washington Post op-ed with Walter Dellinger, a partner at O’Melveny who had worked in the Clinton administration. (Trump fired Dellinger’s son Hampton, who had served as the special counsel in the Office of Special Counsel, earlier this year, sparking a legal battle.) In that op-ed, Goldstein and Dellinger insisted that Trump is “unfit to hold office.”\n\n“In the face of an unprecedented attack on American democracy by a hostile foreign power, Donald Trump and those who worked for him both as a candidate and a president failed to defend the United States,” they wrote regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report into accusations of collusion between Trump and Russia. “For this alone, he is unfit to hold office.”\n\nGolstein and Dellinger wrote that the Mueller report “demonstrates that the president and his closest aides violated … fundamental duties imposed by their oaths of office,” namely the duty to protect and defend the Constitution “against all enemies foreign and domestic.” \n\nDeep State Opposition\n\nA recent poll found that a whopping 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nWhile some political appointees who took “career” positions may faithfully work for the U.S. government under any president, this poll suggests that some staff inside the federal government may work against the goals of the current president, in this case Donald Trump.\n\nFurthermore, a recent Foundation for Government Accountability study found that Democrat employees outnumber Republican employees by a 2-to-1 margin across federal agencies. In the 2024 presidential election, 84% of the money that federal employees gave in political contributions went to Harris.\n\nFederal workers enjoy workplace protections that make them very difficult to fire. The new administration is seeking to reform these rules to enable the president to fulfill his duties as head of the executive branch without facing opposition from hostile bureaucrats.\n\nGoldstein did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Signal by publication time. The Daily Signal also reached out to O’Melveny & Myers, the offices of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the Defense Department, and the White House for comment.","summary":"A lawyer who worked for Kamala Harris&#8217; Senate office and President Joe Biden&#8217;s National Security Council now works in President Donald Trump&#8217;s administration as an...

This is disheartening for me,’ he said, speaking after the enhanced ICE raids took place in Los Angeles, sparking violent rioting in the city.\n\nSchulz revealed in the interview he wanted to address three issues when he interviewed Trump in October 2024 for his Flagrant Podcast that he co-hosts with Akaash Singh, in vitro fertilization, immigration, and foreign wars in the Middle East.\n\nAt the time, Schulz asked Trump whether he would have ‘empathy’ for illegal immigrants, noting that a lot of them were working and wanted a path to citizenship.\n\n‘You have to start with the criminals,’ Trump replied shortly, before pivoting away from the question.\n\nWhen asked about the Middle East, Schultz praised him for developing the Abraham Accords and asked the president if he would pursue more diplomacy in the region if he was reelected.\n\nTrump referred to a biblical prophecy in the book of Revelations about the end of the world, suggesting the escalation of war in the Middle East would lead to nuclear Armageddon.\n\n‘You know, there are great philosophers that said the world will end in the Middle East. We’re not going to let that happen. You’ve heard that expression,’ Trump said. ‘We’re not going to let that happen, okay?’\n\nSchultz' brash and anti-woke comedic style found a huge audience online in just a few years and he now boasts 3 million YouTube subscribers. \n\nTrump’s interview with Schulz and his friends on the podcast made a huge splash in the comedian community as the president spoke frankly about his interview strategy that included ‘the weave.’\n\n‘I do a thing called the weave and there are those that are fair that say this guy is so genius. And then others would say, oh, he rambled. I don’t ramble,’ he said in a clip that was widely shared on social media. \n\nThe interview, which now has 9.6 million views on YouTube, was notable for revealing Trump's sense of humor and authenticity as he spoke about politics. \n\nSchulz was praised by his audience for asking about questions that were relevant to them, rather than focusing on making the president look bad. \n\nTrump’s last-minute focus on interviews with comedian podcasters was later seen as an untraditional but successful way to reach last minute deciders, particularly young men.\n\nIn the Times, Schulz confirmed he voted for Trump in the 2024 election even though he considered himself a Democrat. He cited his dissatisfaction with Biden's presidency.\n\n‘I voted for Trump, yeah, but my vote was more like I voted against a Democratic institution that I feel was stripping the democratic process from its constituents,’ he said. ‘I didn’t like the way things were going, and Kamala was saying, Yeah, we’re going to keep doing that.’\n\nSchulz said that he reached out to the Harris campaign for an interview through many different channels and he claimed the campaign lied about his efforts to interview them. \n\n'It’s wild to blatantly lie when not only did I reach out — Charlamagne, who’s working with them, reached out. Mark Cuban, who’s a surrogate, reached out, and we reached out, and they blatantly lie,' he said. \n\nSchultz said he reached out to then-transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, vice presidential nominee Tim Walz, former President Barack Obama, and even former President Bill Clinton but they all turned him down. \n\nAfter the election, however, Buttigieg, Sen. Bernie Sanders, and other Democrats appeared on his podcast to talk politics, comedy, and culture. \n\nSchulz said he would continue to ask political figures about the questions that mattered to him, not just the questions that the media wanted him to ask. \n\n'What I’d like to see more is people asking the questions that they are curious about themselves, instead of trying to pander to what their audience is curious about,' he said.","summary":"Podcast host and comedian Andrew Schultz appears to have soured a bit on President Donald Trump, after a groundbreaking podcast interview with the president in 2024.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14839057/comedian-andrew-schulz-sours-donald-trump.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/23/15/99639845-0-image-a-11_1750690658865.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 15:47:29","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.061},{"id":334373330,"title":"As US bombs Iran, Trump’s past quotes targeting Kamala Harris during election campaign become hot memes online","text":"As US bombs Iran, Trump’s old attacks on Kamala Harris explode into viral memes: The internet never forgets—especially when the world is watching. As U.S. forces launched a massive bombing campaign on Iran's nuclear facilities over the weekend, a wave of old Donald Trump quotes targeting former Vice President Kamala Harris has suddenly gone viral again—this time, as meme fodder. Trump’s past jabs—calling Harris “low IQ,” mocking her Indian and Black heritage, and mispronouncing her name—have resurfaced across social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and TikTok. But this time, they're being repurposed in a new context: America’s sudden military action in the Middle East. Why are Trump–Kamala memes trending now? After President Trump authorized airstrikes on Iran’s key nuclear sites—including Fordow, Natanz, and Isfahan—global headlines exploded with reactions. But in the chaotic swirl of commentary, netizens began recycling Trump’s 2024 campaign insults as punchlines to comment on current U.S. leadership, decision-making, and foreign policy. Some of the viral formats include: “Low IQ Kamala” memes juxtaposed with images of military briefings. Heritage jokes poking at how identity politics intersect with global conflict. Name mispronunciation clips set against dramatic background music and breaking news overlays. What’s the deeper meaning behind the memes?While these memes are darkly humorous, they also reflect the internet's ongoing obsession with political personalities. Trump’s aggressive campaign style—filled with mocking nicknames and viral soundbites—has left behind a digital archive tailor-made for meme culture. The revival of these quotes in the shadow of international war highlights how online discourse often blends entertainment with real-world crises. Why are Trump’s old Kamala Harris quotes going viral again?While the world focused on the Iran nuclear crisis, social media users dug up old quotes from President Trump targeting former Vice President Kamala Harris. One line in particular — “IS SHE TALKING ABOUT ME?” — which Trump posted on Truth Social during Harris’s 2024 DNC speech, has resurfaced as a meme.Other older remarks, including mocking her name pronunciation, calling her “low IQ”, and bizarrely claiming she had “shape-shifted identities,” are circulating widely again. These are being shared on platforms like Reddit, TikTok, and X (formerly Twitter), with users using satire to contrast Trump’s wartime leadership with his past controversial comments.The memes, while humorous to many, highlight the way internet culture blends political criticism with entertainment, especially during major world events. Q: Many are telling you to stop with the personal attacks against Kamala Harris...Trump: I’m angry at her. I don’t have respect for her. She attacks me. She called me weird pic.twitter.com/TGHJgMYuv4— The Intellectualist (@highbrow_nobrow) September 24, 2024 Trump praised the precision operation as a “spectacular military success,” but the action has sparked widespread condemnation and warnings of further conflict. Iran vowed serious retaliation, and countries like Russia and China openly criticized the United States’ move, calling it dangerous and provocative.How has Iran responded to the US airstrikes? Iran’s foreign minister called the attacks a “clear act of war” and warned that the U.S. would face “unpredictable and wide-reaching consequences.” The Iranian government has already placed its military forces on high alert. A senior official stated, “There will be no silence. There will be a response.” Massive protests erupted in Tehran and other major cities, with chants of “Death to America” ringing across the streets. Iran has also formally filed complaints with the United Nations, labeling the strikes as a violation of international law. 122028555What is the global reaction to the US bombing of Iran? The international community reacted swiftly and with concern. Russia strongly condemned the U.S. action, and a Kremlin spokesperson even hinted that some nations might consider assisting Iran’s nuclear program in response. China joined in criticism, calling the strikes “reckless” and urging both sides to step back. Meanwhile, EU leaders and the United Nations pleaded for restraint and diplomacy. European Council President Charles Michel said, “The world cannot afford a new war in the Middle East. We urge all parties to return to the negotiation table.” The move also prompted emergency meetings at the UN Security Council in New York, though no consensus was reached on how to respond to the crisis.What weapons did the US use in Iran’s nuclear strike?The Pentagon confirmed the use of the GBU-57 Massive Ordnance Penetrator, a 30,000-pound bunker-busting bomb designed to penetrate heavily fortified underground targets. This was the first time the GBU-57 was used in actual combat. These bombs were dropped by B-2 Spirit stealth bombers, capable of evading radar and reaching deep into enemy territory.In addition to airstrikes, Tomahawk cruise missiles were launched from at least two U.S. submarines stationed in the Persian Gulf. The operation lasted under an hour but hit all three primary enrichment sites with what military officials described as “surgical precision.”What’s next for the US, Iran, and the world? With Iran vowing retaliation, and the US warning of further strikes if provoked, the situation remains fragile. Military analysts say Iran may respond via proxy attacks in Iraq, Syria, or through missile launches targeting US assets in the Gulf. The U.S. has already increased its naval and air presence in the region. President Trump said in a late-night address, “We are ready. Iran knows we are watching every move.” Meanwhile, oil prices have surged, stock markets remain volatile, and travelers are being warned to avoid parts of the Middle East. Global powers — from Europe to Asia — are now scrambling to de-escalate the situation before it spirals into a larger regional conflict. US bombed three Iranian nuclear sites on June 22, using bunker-busting GBU-57 bombs and Tomahawk missiles. Trump declared it a success, warning of more action if Iran retaliates. Iran condemned the strikes, threatened serious response, and activated its military. Russia, China, and the UN warned of dangerous global escalation. Old Trump quotes about Harris have resurfaced online, fueling meme trends amid the crisis.FAQs: Q: Why did the US strike Iran’s nuclear sites on June 22, 2025? A: The US aimed to stop Iran’s advanced uranium enrichment at underground nuclear facilities. Q: What weapons did the US use to hit Iran’s nuclear sites? A: The US used GBU-57 bunker-buster bombs and Tomahawk missiles launched from B-2 bombers and submarines.","summary":"Trump Kamala Harris memes are taking over the internet just as the U.S. bombs Iran’s nuclear sites.

This exhaustion is a strangely underexplored reason for his appeal; it may even help explain why his heavy use of executive power (verging on what some experts have no problem calling authoritarianism) is often met with shrugs and blank stares.\n\nJust to take one surprising example: Last month, Trump swept away worries about his tariff war raising the cost of an array of consumer products by suggesting that children didn’t need so many toys (“I don’t think a beautiful baby girl needs—that’s 11 years old—needs 30 dolls”)—to which a chorus on the anti-consumerist left responded, Yeah, you’re probably right. Although most observers interpreted Trump’s comments as a gaffe (because what president since Jimmy Carter has suggested that Americans should scrimp?), the journalist Alissa Quart wrote that Trump had “unwittingly” put his finger on a real problem, that “American kids are being overly defined by material goods and they and we need to buy less.” Writing in Slate, Rebecca Onion, also holding her nose, admitted that “American parenthood is an intense encounter with the excesses of the consumer economy, where the acquisition of stuff feels like it’s not in your control.”\n\nMuch of Trump’s schtick—the aspiration to wear a crown (literally), the assertion that “I alone can fix it,” the ostentatious governing through reward and punishment—can be seen as a leader offering his subjects relief from the burden of making decisions. This is not to say that Trump has developed such a supreme case for himself as daddy, but rather that his popularity reveals the readiness of Americans to turn to one. The desire to have someone else choose might have to do with just how valueless our many options have become. Think of the expansive selection of “mid” TV shows to pick from on Netflix, or the nearly infinite number of possible sexual partners that fly by on Tinder, or the agony of selecting a candidate at the polls (among either, usually, two flawed politicians or, as in New York City’s ranked-choice Democratic primary, so many candidates that consensus feels unreachable).\n\nThe notion that Trump is the wrong answer to the right question has become something of a truism for liberals. But perhaps he is, in this unintended way, pointing us to the end of “choice idolatry.” This is the phrase that the historian Sophia Rosenfeld uses in her recent book, The Age of Choice, which sets out to explain how freedom came to be synonymous with having an endless number of possible doors to open, and how wrapped up our sense of self is with the ability “to make one’s own personally satisfying choices, with a minimum of impediments, from among a range of options.” She uses idolatry for a distinct reason, suggesting that we might be reaching a golden-calf moment: As shiny and captivating as choice has been for so long, it is revealing itself as a hollow source of identity and a distraction from what really matters.\n\nRosenfeld, who teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, calls herself a “historian of the taken-for-granted.” (A previous book of hers traced the history of common sense.) The presumption that freedom equals choice is the kind of fixed notion she is primed to deconstruct. To think of humans as a species that revels in possibility—unlike, say, anteaters or mice, who are not exactly seeking out novelty—seems self-evident. But Rosenfeld’s book demonstrates just how recent and culturally constructed this definition is, a seeping consequence of social and psychological developments over the past 300 years that gradually saturated the way people came to see themselves.\n\nCeasing to think of freedom as the possession of many options would be no small rupture. What might take its place? Abandoning a consumerist worldview might not be the worst thing for humanity, and for Americans in particular—it might lead to a sturdier value system, maybe one more concerned with the common good. But the resulting vacuum could just as easily be filled by Trump’s idea of freedom, one based on power and sovereignty over others, and on screwing the other guy before he screws you. The cruelty of this vision almost demands a reinvigoration of choice, an effort to salvage what had made this human impulse so liberating to begin with.\n\nFor Rosenfeld, the first inklings of our choosiness could be glimpsed in Western Europe in the late 17th century. Picture a woman walking into a store that sells calicos, which were ornamental pieces of cotton from India printed with varied and colorful designs of flowers, birds, and the like. These were some of the first pieces of frippery available, sold at a price point that made them accessible to more than just the rich. No longer was the act of buying goods one of provisioning, asking for flour or butter from behind the counter. Now the products were on display, Rosenfeld writes, “hung from hooks inside shops or on the side of entranceways in enticing folds that stretched down to the floor in a simulation of women’s copious skirts.” This was not mere sustenance; it was seduction.\n\nDuring the century that followed, choice exploded. Soon, sales catalogs laying out the choicest wares were read for pleasure, presenting opportunities to fantasize. A new style of eating establishment, by the 1790s exemplified in the Parisian bistro, offered expanding menus of meats and sauces and drinks in hundreds of possible variations.\n\nThe habits of mind that formed around these activities altered the way people thought about their lives. This is Rosenfeld’s central contention. But shopping was soon perceived to have a moral cost; it was seen, she writes, “as emancipatory and as selfish and indulgent.” An anxiety attached itself to choice even as the rituals of consumption were becoming ingrained—the coveting, the browsing, the haggling, the price comparison.\n\nShopping guides emerged to help guard against making bad choices. The Tea Purchaser’s Guide; or, The Lady and Gentleman’s Tea Table and Useful Companion, in the Knowledge and Choice of Teas, authored anonymously by “A Friend to the Public,” could be considered a kind of 18th-century Wirecutter. Such compendia were created to avoid choosing according to “fancy” or “whim,” two vices that made their appearance in novels of the time, as did a new stock female character: the coquette. This was the woman who exercises her power to choose by browsing extensively but also withholding a decision. She teases. As Rosenfeld emphasizes throughout her history, such excesses were often projected onto women, who were accused of causing “social and moral decay” through their frivolity and unexpected economic power.\n\nThe shopping revolution was as significant as the more obvious political revolts that occurred around the same time. The philosophers of liberalism and the authors of new constitutions may have provided a language for talking about individual freedom, but it was the consumer’s habit, in Rosenfeld’s framing, that eventually trickled down and transformed political systems into expressions of personal preference.\n\nBecause of the dangers of unhindered possibility, the expansion of choice came with guardrails, rules meant to stave off anarchy and social disorder. The use of dance cards at 19th-century balls—another of Rosenfeld’s charmingly idiosyncratic examples—expanded women’s agency in choosing a mate. The little booklets allowed a woman to create a menu of options, but they also precluded a free-for-all—it was highly improper, for example, to dance with the same partner for more than a waltz or two.\n\nWith the introduction of the secret ballot, in the Yorkshire town of Pontrefract in 1872, choice idolatry conquered its last frontier: voting. No longer would elections be noisy, populous affairs in which candidates would treat voters to food and drink in a shared good time for all. No longer would political choice be the result of something like a public caucus, a ritual that mostly just codified already existing social alliances. The secret ballot began as an “experiment,” as one local paper put it, in which one was to go “alone and unbefriended to a compartment,” in the words of another, and indicate one’s favored candidate. This solitary physical act soon became, Rosenfeld writes, “what modern freedom is supposed to feel like.” The secret ballot became the most fundamental of rights in a democracy. Attention turned to the question of who should secure this right, and understandably so: Women and minority groups understood its power, even as an emblem (recall Afghan women in 2014 proudly raising their ink-stained fingers to indicate that they had taken part).\n\nYet even before that first ballot was shoved into a box, some saw the shift from the communal act of voting, messy as it had been, to the purely individual as carrying its own problems. Writing in 1861, John Stuart Mill, a champion of liberalism, worried about what would be let loose in the secrecy of the voting booth, where an elector might be encouraged to “use a public function for his own interests, pleasures or caprice.” Voters would think of their choices as a way “to please themselves,” or as an expression of their “personal interests, or class interest, or some mean feeling in his own mind.” The whole process, Mill argued, would move voting away from a referendum on a community’s values and toward an act of whimsy, like browsing from an array of calico clothes.\n\nThe 20th century only further solidified the idea of choice as the paramount freedom, which also meant shedding some of the guardrails of earlier eras. Many economists came to perceive an individual as the sum of their preferences, a choosing machine, Homo economicus, acting rationally and always maximizing the collective good through their own self-interest. The celebration of market-based individualism hit a peak when Milton Friedman’s neoliberalism triumphed in the 1980s. Friedman once wrote that “the freedom of people to control their own lives in accordance with their own values is the surest way to achieve the full potential of a great society.”\n\nAt the same time, paradoxically, the 20th century provided much reason for skepticism about how much control humans really have over their choices. Freud revealed the subterranean sources of our desires; advertisers manipulate our taste for breakfast cereals as well as presidents. In this century, at least to a behavioral psychologist such as the late Daniel Kahneman, even the question of free will seems unsettled. This insecurity is particularly glaring in a world of proliferating algorithms that serve us more of what they predict we will want and AIs that offer to do the thinking for us.\n\nIf choice is the “useless and exhausted idiom” that Rosenfeld suggests it might be by the end of her history, then maybe the concept is worth abandoning altogether. Doing so, she writes, would be akin to asking “if we are done with capitalism and democracy and their special offspring, human rights”—if we are ready, that is, to throw out the dominant principle of the contemporary world.\n\nI don’t think we are. But if choice has indeed become an end unto itself, absent a set of principles for actually making choices, then something has gone awry.\n\nAbortion rights is a telling test case. In the late 1960s, feminists began using the slogan “My Body, My Choice” to argue for the legalization of abortion in order to make it seem to be a self-evident right: Americans would never stand in the way of freedom, and to be free was to have choices. But what is clearer now, after the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which overturned Roe v. Wade, is that the pro-choice argument was fragile. It gave conservatives the chance to challenge the consumerist-sounding appeal to “choice” with the more moral-sounding appeal of “life.” But even more damning are critiques of this framing from the left. The decision to rely on “choice,” Rosenfeld writes, made access to abortion “solely a civil right, a right to fulfill individual desires without government interference, not a social or economic right framed in response to essential needs or a matter of social justice.” She explains that this made abortion seem like “something for sale exclusively to those who had the resources—financial, familial, and psychological—to select it in a reproductive marketplace.”\n\nIs it possible to make an argument for abortion without resorting to choice idolatry? I began to hear an inkling of this possibility during the recent presidential campaign. Access to abortion was presented not as a matter of personal bodily autonomy but as a public-health concern. In one memorable speech, Michelle Obama painted a dire picture of what would happen to women if, because of abortion bans, they didn’t get “the care” they needed; to the male partners of these women, she said, “You will be the one pleading for somebody, anybody, to do something.” Kamala Harris, in her one debate with Trump, also turned to images of medical distress—of “pregnant women who want to carry a pregnancy to term suffering from a miscarriage, being denied care in an emergency room.” Rather than appealing to women’s personal agency, Harris invoked other values: communal care and well-being.\n\nWhat I picked up in this tonal shift was a realization among liberals, conscious or not, that just arguing for having choices was not enough. It matters how you choose and what you choose. What matters is the moral choice in question, the stakes—in this case, what we value more: the health and happiness of the mother, or the existence of her fetus.\n\nThis is a harder debate to have, and it demands making a more profound argument than one simply in favor of choice, but it is also more rewarding. In his 1946 lecture “Existentialism Is a Humanism,” Jean-Paul Sartre compared making moral choices to “the construction of a work of art.” The decisions you make at every juncture are what make you. This is as true of a person’s life as it is of a society. “Freedom could be reconfigured as the chance to do what one ought rather than simply what one desired,” Rosenfeld writes. Releasing ourselves from choice idolatry doesn’t have to mean letting someone else—an imperial president, for instance—decide for us. It means separating good choices from bad, understanding these categories as the ones that matter, delineating them alongside our fellow citizens. This, rather than just being drunk on options, should be the sweet slog of modernity.","summary":"How did freedom become synonymous with having lots of options?","url":"https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2025/06/americans-are-tired-choice/683273/","image":"https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/yNWyNM7hsC7bFH_5zUsiVq9Tnt8=/0x26:1200x651/1200x625/media/img/mt/2025/06/choice/original.gif","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 12:00:00","author":"Gal Beckerman","authors":["Gal Beckerman"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":334288966,"title":"Wildest Rumors About Kamala Harris That Almost Destroyed Her Reputation","text":"The thing about being a public figure is that it’s nearly impossible to stay away from bizarre rumors. And when someone’s a political figure, things could get much worse as it isn’t just the common people and tabloids who speculate about their life, but also their political rivals. Be it Barack Obama, Donald Trump, Joe Biden, or JD Vance, they all have had their fair share of rumors. And so does former Vice President Kamala Harris. \n\nFrom speculation about troubles in her marriage, to curiosity around her birth place, Kamala couldn’t escape negative headlines ever since she stepped up the political ladder. She lost the presidential elections to Trump in 2024, but it didn’t mean the end of her political career. Nor did it mean that her life could finally be free from rumors. So, let’s revisit some of the most viral speculations about her over the last few years. \n\nKamala Harris is allegedly an avid drinker\n\nSeveral reports have claimed that Kamala Harris has a drinking problem. Even during her Christmas speech at DC, it was alleged that she appeared bleary-eyed, and slurred her words. The rumors first gained attention in August 2024 when Trump’s political campaign director, James Blair tweeted, “A lot of rumors out there about Kamala having a serious drinking problem…apparently coming into focus as campaign heats up.”\n\nA lot of rumors out there about Kamala having a serious drinking problem…apparently coming into focus as campaign heats up.\n⏳Stay Tuned…\n— James Blair (@JamesBlairUSA) August 18, 2024\n\nHarris’ supporters immediately came to her defense. Someone replied, “You take split second clips and make them seem like that. I watch the entire rallies, she seems fine to me.”\n\nAnother wrote, “You Republicans really have nothing against Kamala Harris do you?”\n\nHowever, the Republicans didn’t stop spreading the rumors. Trump himself said, “Does she drink? Is she on dr-gs?” while adding, “I don’t know.” \n\nEven after the Republicans won the elections, they didn’t stop attacking Harris. When JD Vance was asked how he is handling his new job as VP, he said to Daily Caller, “Well, I don’t have four shots of vodka before every meeting. That’s one way I think that Kamala really tried to bring herself into the role is these word salads and I think I would need the help of a lot of alcohol to answer a question the way that Kamala Harris answered questions.”\n\nKamala Harris’ ‘birther’ conspiracy theory\n\nIf you follow US politics, you would know that Harris was labelled “ineligible” to be the president of the United States because neither of her parents were born in the States. Donald Trump amplified the rumors by mentioning the same in his media interactions. It was certainly a déjà vu moment because Trump is known to question his opponent’s citizenship (remember Barack Obama rumor?)\n\nIt’s really something to see them bringing back the same exact birther conspiracy lie they used against Obama — prominently Donald Trump — to spur what’s now been more than a decade of unhinged, reality-denying, anti-fact, ever-degenerating, chaotic, wild-eyed political insanity. https://t.co/P3B3WqD471\n— David DeWitt (@DC_DeWitt) July 22, 2024 \n\nThe rumors turned out to be false as Associated Press did a fact check and obtained a copy of her birth certificate. It was proven that Harris was born on Oct. 20, 1964, in Oakland, California, and was clearly eligible to run for VP or President. \n\nKamala Harris’ relationship with Willie Brown\n\nKamala Harris’ past relationship was dug up as she eyed to secure an important position at the White House. Harris was just 29 when she met then 60-year-old Willie Brown. A member of the Democratic Party, Brown served as the mayor of San Francisco from 1996 to 2004. It was rumored that they had an affair while Brown was still married. However, this rumor turned out to be entirely false .\n\nFactCheck.org debunked the floating theory and revealed that Brown had been separated from his wife for more than a decade when he and Harris began dating. \n\nFOOTAGE FROM 1995 SHOWS KAMALA HARRIS OUT AT NIGHT WITH WILLIE BROWN HER LOVER AND KAMALA 31 YEARS YOUNGER THAN WILLIE WAS ASKED: “EXCUSE ME ARE YOU HIS (WILLIE BROWN’S) DAUGHTER.❓️” KAMALA ANSWERS: “NO I’M NOT!”\n🧵 pic.twitter.com/VFMNjJC0uq\n— Donald Trump Fan Account (@Pavankumar1834) January 10, 2025 \n\nIt has also been alleged that Harris developed an intimate relationship with Brown only to advance her career. And the one who spread these rumors was none other than Donald Trump. During a press conference at Mar-A-Lago in August 2024, Trump said, “Well, I know Willie Brown very well.”\n\n“He (Brown) told me terrible things about her. (Kamala Harris). Anyway, I guess he had a big part in what happened with Kamala, but he… I don’t know, maybe he’s changed his tune. But he was not a fan of hers very much at that point,” Trump said, as reported by Kron4. \n\nAs usual, Trump was openly making baseless comments about his opponent. However, Brown came forward and claimed that no such conversation happened between him and Trump. He hinted at having good relationship with Harris and that he never said a bad thing about her. Brown also said that he wouldn’t hesitate to sue Trump if he ever dragged his name into his election campaign. \n\nKamala Harris’ marriage is in trouble\n\nEven after she lost the elections, rumors haven’t stopped following her. In the last few months, several media reports have claimed that Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff might be heading for divorce. It is alleged that Harris blames Emhoff for her loss at the 2024 elections. \n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nA post shared by Doug Emhoff (@douglasemhoff) \n\nFrom having an extramarital affair during his first marriage to allegedly slapping his former girlfriend, Emhoff has been embroiled in serious controversies that no public figure would want to be associated with. Though the rumors have been floating since the election results came out, Harris hasn’t really ended her marriage. The couple is sometimes spotted together and they even appear on each other’s social media profiles every now and then.","summary":"Several bizarre rumors about Kamala Harris have been floating in the media ever since she secured the position of VP under Biden administration.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wildest-rumors-about-kamala-harris-that-almost-destroyed-her-reputation","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Untitled-design-2025-06-23T143343.136.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 11:41:09","author":"Doug Emhoff,Kanika Saini","authors":["Doug Emhoff","Kanika Saini"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":334310248,"title":"‘People Have the Right to Be Outraged’: Charlamagne on Diddy, Trump, and Cancel Culture","text":"uppose your idea of radio personality Charlamagne tha God comes from clips of the veteran host’s most absurd moments on his show, The Breakfast Club. Like, when he asked Magic Johnson his first thought after receiving his HIV diagnosis. Or when, during a segment with rapper and actor Safaree, he blurted out “Nah, that ain’t it” in response to the artist freestyling. You might expect the real-life Charlamagne, born Lenard Larry McKelvey in Charleston, South Carolina, to mirror the unfiltered provocateur listeners have tuned into for nearly 30 years. In person, he is no doubt an apostle of the Biggie Smalls lyric “Bite my tongue for no one.” Adorned in a T-shirt featuring the animated political satire The Boondocks, he’s at ease in the iHeartRadio studios in midtown Manhattan, more than happy to offer his take on just about everything. \n\n But this version of Charlamagne, who turns 47 later this month, is not the one you might’ve seen in viral videos. With decades in the public eye, and on what he describes as a “healing journey,” the Charlamagne in front of me on this rainy spring afternoon is rather zen. He is well aware that his older persona differs, in some ways wildly, from his current, more mature sensibility. “It’s something my good friend [author and wellness guru] Devi Brown always says: ‘You got to learn to love every single version of yourself. Every single version of yourself serves a purpose.’” \n\n The author of three bestsellers, and the founder of the podcast network Black Effect, as well as the Black Privilege publishing imprint with Simon & Schuster, Charlamagne has made storytelling his life’s work. These days, married with four daughters, he tells me his primary focus is finding ways to be “of service.” He’s an outspoken advocate for mental health and has been candid in his books about his challenges growing up in South Carolina, experiencing abuse and incarceration at a young age. He founded the nonprofit organization the Mental Wealth Alliance with Alfiee Breland-Noble in 2019, and he supports a scholarship at his mother’s alma mater, South Carolina State University, for Black students to study English or communications. Charlamagne says his mental health work allows him to look back on his past with a sense of clarity. \n\n “There’s been plenty of times I came on this radio and projected my hurt on the people. There’s been plenty of times I came on this radio and projected my unhealed trauma on the people,” he says. “And that’s why doing the work is so important. It will change you as a person, which ultimately changes you as a personality.”\n\n Even so, some things don’t change. Charlamagne’s routine has remained more or less the same for his decades-long career in radio: Up at the crack of dawn and live on the airwaves shortly after. “Literally, this is my life,” he says, seated in a conference room adjacent to the studios where The Breakfast Club records each morning. “To be a morning-radio personality, you’re setting people’s tone for the day.” \n\n Over the years, Charlamagne built the kind of deeply personal relationship with his audience that presaged the always-on culture of content creators of the 21st century. It’s what makes The Breakfast Club, which he’s co-hosted since 2010, a cultural force. By now, the show has become a reliably authentic dialogue within the Black community — during the past two presidential elections, Charlamagne was the go-to conduit between Democratic politicians and undecided Black voters. His career consists of multitudes: the comedic if not brash hip-hop radio host forged by the shock-jock era, and the thoughtful political commentator, able to articulate what even his critics would describe as a pretty nuanced perspective on the world. \n\n “I’m happy that people can go back to certain moments and hear certain things and be like, ‘Bruh, that dude. He really has grown; he used to be really wild. He might still be a little wild now, but he used to be really, really wild,’” he says. “And for the people who say things like, ‘Man, I miss the old Charlamagne. I want that back’ — go back and listen to the old shit then.” \n\n Right now, downtown, Sean “Diddy” Combs is on trial for sex trafficking, prostitution, and racketeering. You’ve talked to him many times over the years. What’s going through your mind as this situation is unfolding? It’s sad. And people got mad at me, I think it was last year, because I said that when it first happened. I’m like, “Yo, we got to stop acting like these situations don’t bring out a plethora of emotions.” This is complex, especially if you’re a hip-hop-head. I was in jail writing down things I wanted to do for my future, saying I wanted to be signed to Bad Boy in ’96, ’97, because I used to rap. And so for me, man, just sitting back watching the situation, yeah, it is sad to watch yet another one of us … That’s what it feels like, right? It feels like, another one of us. I’ve been watching this my whole life. Michael Jackson, Bill Cosby, R. Kelly. It’s like, damn. So, yeah, it’s not a good feeling. It’s not something that you … Don’t get me wrong. Some of the shit’s hilarious. We need The Boondocks and Dave Chappelle to come back right now. Because just this week, another man says he wants the other man’s nuts rubbed on his nipples? Come on, yo. You’re not going to sit here and tell me that’s not comedy. \n\n I can’t act like it’s one emotion. It’s easy to say, “Oh, man, fuck him. He’s a piece of shit,” blah, blah, blah, this and that. Yeah, he might be all of those things, but guess what? He also was somebody that every single time we was out in the party, he got the party started. He was a person that all of y’all was running around saying you was the Diddy of your city. Don’t act like you weren’t, now, OK? I see you changing your Instagram names and all of that, but at one point that was your guy. So that shit, it just sucks to watch.\n\n And it ain’t just him. There’s plenty of people you watch crash and burn. That’s why I see certain brothers, man, certain sisters that have been around a long time, and I literally give them a pound and I compliment them because I say to them, I say, “Man, your plane has landed and the wheels came out.” Everybody always talks about the ascension and being up in the air, but when you land, you got to make sure your wheels come out. There’s a lot of people landing whose wheels ain’t coming out, and they’re crashing and burning.\n\n What do you make of the narrative that there’s an effort to take down prominent Black men?Listen, that is a narrative that is rooted in truth. We can’t act like that has not happened throughout the history of Black people’s existence in this country. We’ve seen that, whether it’s the Nation of Islam, whether it’s the Black Panther Party, whether it is Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. But think about those people I named and what they were doing. A lot of you entertainers just got bad fucking habits. Cut it out. Ain’t nobody trying to take y’all down. When people say it’s a shakedown, sure, but don’t give them nothing to shake. Make better choices. It’s really just that simple. At some point you got to have accountability and stop pointing fingers and blaming everything on the system or the white man. We’ll name all of those people in the entertainment space, in the sports space, and then try to lump them in with people who actually were really changing the world. Yeah, have we seen this system take down Black people before? Of course, that’s what Cointelpro was, all of that. That’s what J. Edgar Hoover specialized in, absolutely. But a lot of these entertainers, they’re just making poor choices.\n\n “Cancel culture has been canceled. Say what you say. If it’s right, it’s right. If it’s wrong, it’s wrong.”\n\n I’m thinking of the time Joe Biden came on the show during the 2020 presidential race and said, “If you have a problem figuring out if you’re for me or for Trump, you ain’t Black.” Have there been moments where a white person is maybe taking liberties with the fact that they’re speaking to a Black audience on the show?Do you know why Joe Biden’s “you ain’t Black” moment never bothered me? My reaction in that moment was my real reaction. This ain’t about who’s Black, it’s about trying to get something for my people. That’s how he really felt, and that’s because he had a bunch of Black people around him who used to say that. And I’m not making no excuses for him, because I’m not nobody fan, but that was just a bad granddad joke. And shit, was he wrong? All he’s essentially saying is, “Yo, if you vote for this person, you’re voting against your own interest.” And it’s interesting, because 2020, he won. People didn’t feel like that. Now, [Trump is] back in the White House, and you see a lot of his own supporters, the Candace Owenses of the world, the Ben Shapiros of the world, you see them saying, “What the hell is going on?” Candace Owens is calling Trump out, saying, “You can’t do that in regards to freedom of speech.” Saying, “I don’t like what he’s doing with DOGE.” You got Dave Portnoy trying to figure out what’s going on with his stocks, the economy’s messed up. You got Shapiro calling him out about taking the jet from [Qatar]. You can’t do that. So it’s like, was Biden wrong when he told Black people, “You voting against your own interest”? [Trump] told you he was going to do all of those things. So if you voted for that, you voted against your own interest. \n\n People have lumped you in with the comedian Andrew Schultz, your co-host on the podcast Brilliant Idiots. Kendrick Lamar seemed to take a shot at him for a joke about Black women that he made on a different show, and the internet brought your name into it. What do you make of the critique that you were allowing this white man to speak too freely?Everybody is allowed to have their opinion. Andrew Schultz is a grown man, I don’t “allow” him to do anything. He does what he wants to do. I don’t even know what my reaction would’ve been if I heard him say that [on our show]. Probably it wouldn’t have been nothing, because the reality is, that is somebody I actually know. We’ve been doing Brilliant Idiots for 12 years, and we’ve been friends longer than that. I know his mom, I know his dad. He knows my family. He was at my wedding; I was at his wedding. How are you going to tell me who he is? You don’t even know him, you know a clip. If that was your introduction to Andrew, that probably wasn’t the best introduction. But if you know Andrew, his die-hard fans that travel with him all around the world, selling out these arenas, that sold out the Garden — twice — they know his style of comedy. And listen, sometimes you shoot, sometimes you miss. But a comedian has the right to be a comedian. People have the right to free speech. But we know speech ain’t free. There’s a price that comes out of your mouth. And the reason I rock with Andrew is because he’s willing to deal with the consequences of the things that come out of his mouth.\n\n Do you go back and watch your old interviews a lot, or do you stay away from the past?Sometimes you’ll just see clips. And like I said, I’m 46, so I’m like, “What the fuck was I talking about?” So I got to go back and watch the whole interview for context. I do that a lot. Or when somebody passes, I go back and I watch the interview just to see if they were immortalized the right way.\n\n That’s why every time you sit down and you talk to somebody, man, you got to make sure you really having that real conversation. Because regardless of whether we know when we’re leaving this Earth or not, these conversations we’re having with these individuals are going to be immortalized. I’ve been doing this long enough to know that. We’re on a lot of documentaries, Breakfast Club. People reach out to us all the time to license content, because we’ve been around that long. Look on the wall in the studio: Charlie Murphy not here no more. Prodigy not here no more. Mac Miller not here no more. Nipsey Hussle. Dick Gregory. Angie Stone. That’s actually the last time I did that — I went to watch Angie’s last conversation with us. One big theme of that interview was her talking about wanting to do a biopic, because a lot of people don’t know the history. Angie was in a rap group. I think that might’ve been hip-hop’s first female rap group, literally. \n\n Recently, I’ve talked to a lot of Twitch streamers like Kai Cenat. I’ve come to realize how similar that world is to radio. What do you think of the new generation of commentators online?I love those guys. I was just thinking about this the other day.I love streaming more than any of the new-media platforms that I’ve seen over the last 15 years, including podcasting. It’s the closest thing to what I do on the radio every day, because these guys are going live. Wendy Williams could go live by herself for four hours straight and be super entertaining, her and the callers. And that’s what these streamers are doing. Kai can go live for hours and be sitting there with his chat, keeping them engaged, doing an interview, talking about some music, whatever it is. Kai, DJ Akademiks. The dude Reggie [Twitch streamer girlhefunny1x]. That dude is hilarious to me. I just like his energy. And the other beautiful thing about guys like Kai and Reggie is, man, you watch them and you’re like, “Yo, y’all can do whatever y’all choose to do.” They’re just using streaming as the platform that gets their name out there and people start to know them. But you can take Reggie and Kai and put them on radio. You can put them on TV, in movies. If they wanted to do a podcast, they could. They can do whatever. \n\n Do you feel like there’s still something special about the terrestrial-radio audience?It’s the most unique media platform still around, because everybody’s commuting in the morning. People have this silly notion that radio is dead. It’s like, go look at the numbers. The same percentage of people in America who used to listen to the radio in the Eighties, Nineties is the same percentage of people who listen to the radio now. It’s like 90-something percent of people. Why? Because radios are still in cars, and people are waking up every morning all around the country and turning on this free entertainment. Now they got the apps, they got whatever app they’re listening to, and they’re listening to it on their commute. So, radio has gone nowhere.\n\n You have four daughters. As they grow up and start watching whatever is out there, whether it’s YouTube, podcasts, or something else, do you pay attention to the content they consume?Absolutely, a hundred percent. My oldest daughter, she’ll be 17 this year. She talks to [my wife and me], so I ain’t tripping off that. It’s the nine-year-old and the six-year-old, the three-year-old that I’m more concerned about, because what they like to watch is YouTube. You got to pay attention to that, because I don’t know what this shit is. You know what I’m saying? So I got to watch it. Sometimes I’m like, “Yo, what the hell these people talking about?” Because my daughter really likes Minecraft, so she used to be watching these videos of people playing Minecraft. But sometimes it’ll be cut with something else. So it’s like, you got to pay attention to what they’re actually on. And it’s interesting to see who is having that intergener-ational impact. My six-year-old knows who MrBeast is.\n\n “I’m not looking for an amen corner. These are my thoughts. This is the way I’m feeling in this moment.”\n\n When you started in the 1990s going into the 2000s, we hadn’t entered the nonstop news cycle. What was that like for you in those early years of social media, when you started to see that shift?I remember me and Lil Duval met on MySpace because we were both writing for Ozone magazine. That’s how you got your name out there nationally; you had to write for a national magazine. So I was writing for Ozone at the time. I had a [column] called the Chin Check, and I think Duval’s was called What I’m Hating On or something like that. And Duval just hit me, like, “Yo, you funny as hell. I like what you be doing.” When YouTube and all that stuff started to come around, we started to utilize it. I was doing skits and sketches. And guess what? In my mind, I wasn’t thinking people all over the country are seeing this, or even people all over the world. In my mind, I’m still just doing this for South Carolina.\n\n Back then it was mixtapes, too. DJ Vlad used to have these mixtapes called Beef. And he literally was taking my interviews and putting them on his Beef mixtapes. So that’s how I was getting out there nationally. It was beautiful because it was very hyperlocal. I still treat it that way. When I wake up in the morning and I get on the air, even though I know Breakfast Club is in 100-plus markets, I’m not treating it like I’m talking to tens of millions of people. I’m treating it like I’m talking to really just who’s in the room, honestly. I don’t have a target audience in my mind, and I think that’s a good thing.\n\n I feel like, back then being a hater was a little bit easier because you weren’t quite broadcasting it to the whole world like today.It’s not like people didn’t see those things, it was just probably a little bit harder for them to reach you. You could only get touched if you was around a person. Or a person couldn’t just “at” you on social media. If a person had a problem with you, you didn’t know until it was too late. Like, “Oh, we in the same place. The same vicinity. What’s happening now?” Now, you do know when somebody got an issue with you because they said something about you on social media, on some platform. Back then, it definitely wasn’t like that.\n\n Has that changed your approach at all? Do you feel like you operate the same way today?Nah, I’m not the same person. Shit, when I started radio, I was 19. So you’re talking about a teenager, a guy in his twenties. I’m 46 now. My mind state was totally different, I wasn’t thinking about nothing back then. It was just shits and giggles, it was fun. It was, “I’m going to say what I want to say because I want to say it.” I still feel like I operate in that space — I’m 46 years old, and I say what I want to say now. If what I wanted to say was the same at 46 as I was at 20, man, that’s a big problem. Muhammad Ali said, “The person who thinks the same at 50 the way they did at 20 has wasted 30 years of their life.”\n\n You don’t self-censor out of concern for so-called cancel culture?Cancel culture has been canceled. People have the right to be outraged. People have the right to disagree; all of that is fine. The reason I say that I still approach things from a hyperlocal perspective is because I can tell when somebody is approaching the microphone and they’re concerned about what the people listening are going to say. What the people who are home on social media are going to say. When the reality is, people are going to disagree with you. I’m not looking for an amen corner, these are my thoughts. This is the way I’m feeling in this moment, and I reserve the right to change my mind.\n\n I might say something one day and get more information and be like, “Yeah, I wasn’t correct yesterday. That’s how I felt yesterday, but this is how I feel today.” There’s nothing wrong with that. People nowadays like to say things and then just either stick to it because of pride, because of ego, or let it go just because they scared of the mob. You can’t trust folks like that. Say what you say. If it’s right, it’s right. If it’s wrong, it’s wrong. If that person changes their mind, they have the right to do that as well, but at least that person is being honest.\n\n Do you think that plays into the election results? Trump speaks to people’s raw emotions, versus Democrats, who tend to be a bit more polished. From your perspective, what have you seen since the election that gives you the sense that cancel culture has been canceled?Well, I’ve been saying that forever as far as Trump is concerned. In my last book, Get Honest About Lying, I got a whole chapter called “The Language of Politics Is Dead,” and it’s because Donald Trump killed it. I grew up on this fantastic movie called Bulworth, which I think everybody should watch. It stars Warren Beatty and Halle Berry and Don Cheadle. And Bulworth is a guy who was a senator in California who ends up running for president because he actually wants to kill himself. And he hired somebody to kill him. And so he’s sitting around, he falls in love with Halle Berry, so he starts hanging out in the hood. So he’s listening to Don Cheadle, who’s the head of a gang, talk about all of the sociological conditions that are causing people in the hood to act the way that they’re acting.\n\n And so Bulworth starts to repeat this stuff, because it’s the truth, right? So the thing about the truth is, you can’t run from it. The truth will impact you in some way, shape, or form. So he just goes out there, and he just starts telling the truth. And I’ve always said, “Man, that will work. That will work.” This movie came out in the Nineties. I was a kid watching that, saying that would work in our society if a politician did that, because that works anywhere. There’s never a time where honesty and authenticity don’t work. Our whole lives, we’ve sat back and watched politicians and know they’re bullshitting us. Whenever you saw a politician actually telling us the truth, whether it was on a local level or a national level, it cut through. Now, was Donald Trump telling the truth? No, not about everything. But he gave off more of an authentic energy than anybody we’ve seen in a long time.\n\n I always said Republicans are more sincere about their lies. Trump is more sincere about his lies than any Democrat in the modern area is about their truth. He’ll get up there and tell you a bald-faced lie with the utmost confidence. I don’t even think he believes he’s lying. I think he really believes the things that are coming out of his mouth in whatever moment he’s saying it. That’s why it comes off as authentic. Meanwhile, a Democrat can be up there trying to tell you the truth, and they stuttering and they stammering and they looking down and they barely want to even talk about whatever the real issue is that they actually probably have a solution for or are passing legislation for.\n\n “We know speech ain’t free. There’s a price to what comes out of your mouth.”\n\n Can you cite an example of that?Recently, Donald Trump signed an executive order to lower the price of prescription drugs. And he did a speech where he was talking about his “fat friend” who called him and said, “Hey, I’ve been taking such and such.” And he told his friend it’s not working and blah, blah. It’s like, yo, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris signed the actual piece of legislation that capped the price of the insulin at $35. I got family members who were super happy about that. But Trump was able to message a simple executive order. It was funny, and it got so much press. And now you see people like, “Yeah, Trump’s lowering the price of prescription drugs.” Biden and Harris actually passed legislation that did that, and they weren’t able to make the noise Trump did. That’s because Donald Trump hit you with storytelling. He told you a story. It was funny, it stuck. Democrats don’t do anything that sticks. \n\n What would you ask Trump if you had the opportunity?I would have to think about it. Especially during the campaign, I had a strategy of how I want to interview Trump. And I’m not even going to say it, because I don’t want nobody to steal my idea. But honestly, it don’t even matter now, because he’s the president. The only thing we should be telling our fellow Americans right now is that when you are the president of the United States of America, it is your job to uphold the Constitution. Simple and plain.\n\n And I don’t care if you’re a Democrat, I don’t care if you’re Republican. I don’t care if you’re Black, I don’t care if you’re white. I don’t care if you’re gay, I don’t care if you’re straight. I don’t care if you’re rich, I don’t care if you’re poor. If you’re an American, you should want the leader of your country to always uphold the Constitution. So when you hear the leader of the free world saying things like he doesn’t know if he has to uphold the Constitution, or taking $400 million jets from foreign countries … These are clear-cut things in the Constitution that he shouldn’t be doing. So you as an American have to point out the fact that what he’s doing is unconstitutional. That’s what we should care about in this moment.\n\n How do you reconcile the fact that, given the length of your career, there are so many versions of you floating around out there?I don’t. To me, I look at it like a rapper probably looks at it. Jay-Z probably sits back and looks at 4:44 as a moment in time. But then he looks at Hard Knock Life as a moment in time. He looks at Reasonable Doubt as a moment in time. And I’ve had conversations with people like Malcolm Gladwell — I remember Malcolm Gladwell broke my heart one time. I can’t remember what book it was, but he was like, “I don’t even believe most of what I wrote in this book anymore.” And I’m like, “What?” But when he broke it down, it made sense. “That’s where I was then. This new work that I’m writing is where I am now.” And that’s just life. I thank God that I got that type of catalog.","summary":"The Breakfast Club host reflects his years in radio, the state of American politics, and whether there’s a conspiracy to take down Black men","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/charlamagne-tha-god-diddy-trump-interview-1235356362/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RS_CHARLEMAGNE_FINAL_TIFF_001-copy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 10:28:00","author":"Chris Kobiella,Jeff Ihaza","authors":["Chris Kobiella","Jeff Ihaza"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.373},{"id":334259256,"title":"Reject The Rail Crew Mandate And Embrace Deregulation","text":"Union Pacific cargo train. (Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\nThe Trump Administration went to court this month to address a controversial Biden-era rule mandating a minimum of two crew members on most freight trains. The regulation, issued by the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) under President Biden, is a textbook example of how Big Labor and political interference have corrupted what should be a data-driven safety agency.\n\nPresident Trump is proudly leading one of the most successful deregulatory efforts in modern history. Rejecting this rail-crew rule would reaffirm that legacy by cutting red tape, advancing innovation and protecting an industry vital to America's economic strength. While the litigation continues, that opportunity still exists.\n\nLet’s be clear: The Biden crew size rule has nothing to do with safety. The Biden administration cited the 2023 East Palestine, Ohio derailment as justification, even though that train already had three crew members onboard—more than the proposed minimum. The FRA itself admitted it couldn’t quantify any safety benefit from the rule. Decades of evidence, including a decline in rail accidents since deregulation in 1980, show that technology and investment—not crew mandates—have driven safety gains. But the rule does serve one purpose: appeasing such labor unions as the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Railroad & Transportation Workers—Transportation Division (SMART-TD), which endorsed Kamala Harris and funneled 99% of its political spending to Democrats and progressive causes.\n\nThat’s not a coincidence. Between 2019 and 2022, SMART directed nearly $80 million toward political advocacy, consulting and special interest groups. Among the top recipients were the California Democratic Party, the BlueGreen Alliance and a slew of far-left environmental and social organizations. Less than 1% of SMART’s political funding went to GOP or bipartisan efforts. This is the group now dictating rail policy under the guise of \"safety.\" It’s joined by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers & Trainmen’s (BLET) union, a Teamsters outfit that backed Kamala Harris for president.\n\nBy rejecting this mandate at the agency level, the Trump Administration can deliver a win for rank-and-file rail workers and the broader American economy, while standing up to Big Labor bosses who push political agendas at the expense of jobs, innovation and real safety progress. Former FRA economist Patrick McLaughlin recently warned in a filing at the Department of Transportation (DOT) that excessive rail regulation—such as this rule—chills innovation, imposes steep costs on shippers and harms low-income communities by raising prices. His research, echoed in dozens of formal comments to the DOT, argues that the regulation creates perverse safety outcomes by undermining the financial health of railroads and discouraging the adoption of technologies that reduce risk and increase efficiency.\n\nIt’s not just McLaughlin; a broad coalition of experts and organizations urged DOT to eliminate this crew-size rule last month. Their message is consistent: Performance-based regulation works; top-down, politically motivated mandates do not. In fact, insisting on outdated staffing models only pushes more freight to trucks—an outcome that increases congestion, pollution and traffic fatalities.\n\nThis destructive, union-backed rule undermines voluntary labor-management agreements that already govern crew sizes in a more flexible and effective manner. The Center for Transportation Advancement points out that rigid staffing mandates override productive negotiations and mimic the failed \"full crew\" laws of the early 1900s—laws long since repealed because they served union interests, not public safety.\n\nPresident Trump has always stood with American workers, job creators and the industries that keep our economy moving. By rejecting this heavy-handed mandate, he can once again lead the charge for innovation and real safety, while standing up to entrenched union bosses who put politics over progress and their interests over those of the rank-and-file workers.\n\nThis rule isn’t about protecting workers; it’s about protecting a political machine that spends millions of dollars fighting against the very prosperity rail jobs help deliver. President Trump was right to stop it once. Now he has the chance to finish the job by restoring fairness to federal rail policy and keeping government focused on results, not special interests.\n\nIt’s time to modernize, cut red tape and let railroads compete, helping make America great again.\n\nGot a tip?

TRUMP DECLARES ‘VERY SUCCESSFUL ATTACK’ ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM AS US FORCES STRIKE 3 KEY SITES Former GOP lawmaker Adam Kinzinger said Trump made the right call in a post on social media, arguing it was a \"good call by the president.\" Kinzinger notably spoke at the DNC and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

And I always joke and say, well, I would have had better health care. That's my joke, and people love it.\"\n\nCastine's history of occupation is visible in the historical markers and remnants of British forts that dot its small grid of streets overlooking Penobscot Bay.\n\nKamala Harris beat Donald Trump here by 47 percentage points in the presidential election last fall, and the president's aggressive comments about Canada were deeply unpopular in Castine and nearby coastal communities.\n\n\"This isn't how you treat your allies,\" said Pete O'Brien, a resident of nearby Rockland who was showing relatives from California the earthworks of Fort George, built by British troops in 1779.\n\n\"We're about as close as it gets to you politically, culturally, geographically.\"\n\nLiam Riordan, a historian at the University of Maine at Orono and an expert on the revolutionary period, said Trump's rhetoric represents \"a failure to understand the close ties and close relationships that we share.\"\n\n\"I think in Maine, the reaction to that has really been one of being appalled and embarrassed.\"\n\nCastine's elevated geographical location at the tip of a peninsula on the eastern side of Penobscot Bay made it a strategic location for colonial powers fighting over North America.\n\nA newspaper correspondent referred to its capture in 1814 as \"perhaps one of the most admirable military positions in the world.\" \n\nIn the 1600s, present-day Castine was the western edge of the French colony of Acadia, with the British-held Massachusetts Bay Colony on the other side of the bay. \n\nFrance gave up all its North American territory in 1763, but when it backed the rebels in the American Revolution, the British seized Castine in case the French decided to take it back.\n\nA revolutionary fleet sailed to Castine to push out the British but failed miserably.\n\n\"A lot of Americans have no idea about the Penobscot expedition and the battle that took place here, because we lost,\" Lutts said. \"We remember the ones that we won.\"\n\nWhen the revolution ended and the British recognized U.S. independence, \"any reasonable person during the treaty negotiations … would have said almost certainly the Penobscot River would be the border,\" Riordan said.\n\nBut John Adams, one of the negotiators, pushed for the St. Croix River to be the border because he recognized how Castine would give the Americans better access to lucrative fish stocks and trade routes. \n\nFour hundred loyalists who had come to Castine during the Revolution to remain under the British Crown moved again, this time settling what would become Saint Andrews, N.B.\n\nSeveral even moved their houses there on boats and placed them on a street grid similar to Castine's, the reason the two towns resemble each other. \n\nThree decades later, during the War of 1812, the British returned to capture Castine again.\n\nThe story goes that American troops at Fort Madison knew they were outnumbered, fired one perfunctory cannon shot for honour's sake and quickly fled.\n\nA local pastor, William Mason, grabbed a white table cloth from his dining room and headed down to the harbour to wave it as a signal of surrender.\n\nCastine was a boomtown under British occupation thanks to trade with other British ports such as Halifax and Saint John.\n\n\"Business is brisk and speculators are daily flocking in from every quarter,\" the Hartford Courant reported in November 1814. \"The war, or rather peace, with the British is becoming very popular here.\" \n\nBut the treaty that ended the War of 1812 returned Castine to the U.S. again.\n\nThousands of pounds collected by the British customs house in Castine remained with the British and was used by Nova Scotia's governor, Lord Dalhousie, to establish a college that later became Dalhousie University. \n\n\"Another reason why we feel very close to Canada is that our money is up there at that university,\" Lutts joked.\n\n\"They're not letting us in for free though.

I was always surprised that Biden didn’t do it!’ Trump wrote. \n\nMusk then taunted Trump to act. \n\n‘This just gets better and better,’ he wrote. ‘Go ahead, make my day …’\n\nTrump’s swipes came after Musk said the Republican would have lost the 2024 election had it not been for the world’s richest man’s help. \n\n‘Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,’ Musk claimed. ‘Such ingratitude,’ the billionaire added on X.\n\nMusk had publicly endorsed Trump on the heels of the July 13th assassination attempt in Butler, Pennsylvania and poured $290 million of his fortune on the Republican’s campaign.\n\nThe billionaire also joined Trump on the campaign trail when he returned to the site of the Butler shooting in early October, a month before Election Day. \n\nTrump said he likely still would have won the key state of Pennsylvania without Musk’s assistance, partly because Kamala Harris didn’t choose the state’s governor, Josh Shapiro, to be her running mate. \n\nEven with Shapiro on the Democratic ticket, Trump claimed, ‘I would have won Pennsylvania, I would have won by a lot.’ \n\nMusk said that was laughable.\n\nDuring the transition, Trump announced that Musk would run the newly created Department of Government Efficiency or ‘DOGE,’ allowing the businessman to take a chainsaw to alleged waste, fraud and abuse. \n\nThose efforts didn’t play well with the American public, with Musk formally out last week. \n\nNow the 53-year-old South African-born billionaire is asserting that he has more staying power in U.S. politics than the 78-year-old president. \n\n‘Oh and some food for thought as they ponder this question: Trump has 3.5 years left as President, but I will be around for 40+ years,’ Musk said Thursday afternoon, responding to a post from MAGA agitator Laura Loomer. \n\nLoomer said she was reporting from Capitol Hill and that Republican lawmakers were trying to determine if it was better to side with Trump or Musk. \n\nMusk’s latest online assault of Trump came moments after the president went on a tirade about the billionaire while hosting German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office. \n\n‘Elon and I had a great relationship. I don’t know if we will any more, I was surprised,’ Trump said. \n\nThe president suggested that Musk was angry – not over the bill ballooning the deficit – but because the Trump administration has pulled back on electric vehicle mandates, which negatively impacted Tesla.\n\nHe also indicated that there was a problem when he rejected Musk’s preferred nominee to lead NASA because his choice was a Democrat.\n\n‘And you know, Elon’s upset because we took the EV mandate, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles, and they’re having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy,’ Trump said. ‘I know that disturbed him.’\n\nShares of Tesla dipped 8 percent amid the spat. \n\nOver the weekend, Trump pulled the nomination of Jared Isaacman to lead NASA. Isaacman had worked alongside Musk at SpaceX.\n\n‘He recommended somebody that I guess he knew very well, I’m sure he respected him, to run NASA and I didn’t think it was appropriate and he happened to be a Democrat, like totally Democrat,’ Trump continued. ‘We won, we get certain privileges and one of the privileges is we don’t have to appoint a Democrat.’ \n\nMusk posted to X repeatedly as Trump’s press conference was going on. \n\n‘Whatever,’ the billionaire wrote, as he continued to criticize what Trump has called his ‘big, beautiful’ spending bill.\n\n‘Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill,’ he advised. \n\n‘In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that [is] both big and beautiful. Everyone knows this!’ Musk continued. ‘Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.’ \n\nIn the Oval Office, Trump insisted that Musk knew the contents of the bill before the House passed it. Trump is now pushing Republican senators to back it so he can sign it before the July 4 holiday. \n\n‘He became a little bit different. I can understand that. But he knew every aspect of this bill. He knew it better than almost anybody, and he never had a problem until right after he left,’ Trump protested. \n\nMusk immediately pushed back on X – sharing the clip of Trump’s comments. \n\n‘False, this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!’ Musk said. \n\nAt the top of Musk’s X profile on Thursday, the billionaire had pinned a tweet that said ‘Wise words,’ highlighting a Trump tweet from 2013 that said, ‘I cannot believe the Republicans are extending the debt ceiling—I am a Republican & I am embarrassed!’\n\nTrump noted that until recently Musk had ‘said the most beautiful things about me.’\n\nIn the Oval Ofice, Trump pointed out that the battle with Musk had yet to turn personal. \n\n‘And he hasn’t said bad about me personally, but I’m sure that will be next,’ Trump said. \n\nHe went on: ‘I’m very disappointed in Elon. I’ve helped Elon a lot.’\n\nTrump suggested Musk was disappointed by life outside the White House. \n\n‘I think he got out there and all of the sudden he wasn’t in this beautiful office,’ Trump said. \n\nTrump said Musk’s about-face represented a greater trend. \n\n‘People leave my administration and they love us and then, at some point, they miss it so badly. And some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. I don’t know what it is, it’s sort of Trump Derangement Syndrome, I guess they call it,’ the president said.\n\n‘They leave, they wake up in the morning and the glamour is gone, the whole world is different and they become hostile.’ \n\nThe president’s comments come less than a week after he feted Musk in the Oval Office, giving him an official farewell as the billionaire moved out of special government employee status and back into the private sector. \n\nTrump noted that he had given Musk a ‘wonderful send-off’ on Friday before he headed to Pittsburgh to tout a steel deal between Nippon and U.S. Steel. \n\n‘Remember, he was here for a long time. You saw a man who was very happy. He stood behind the Oval desk. Even with a black eye,’ Trump said.\n\n‘I said, “do you want a little makeup?” And he said, “No I don’t think so,” which was interesting.’\n\n‘And very nice,’ Trump added. ‘He wants to be who he is,’ the president shrugged.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump asserted that he asked Elon Musk to leave his&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump delivers harsh criticism about Elon&#8217;s mental health first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/celeb/celeb-news/trump-delivers-harsh-criticism-about-elons-mental-health/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Elon-hits-Trump-way-below-the-belt.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 05:07:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.183},{"id":334169138,"title":"Ex-Trump aide Anthony Scaramucci makes lame dig at his old boss with bizarre outfit choice","text":"Former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci has made a lame dig at President Donald Trump by wearing a superhero T-shirt.\n\nThe US military attacked three nuclear facilities across Iran on Sunday, thrusting the country into the Israel-Iran conflict.\n\nTrump stunned the world with the strikes and has called for a regime change in Iran, suggesting its current leaders are 'unable to MAKE IRAN GREAT AGAIN.'\n\n Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said, 'Iran's nuclear ambitions have been obliterated,' noting the operation was an 'incredible and overwhelming success.'\n\nAs US officials caution Iran that any attack on US targets would draw an unprecedented response, Tehran has begun preparing to close the Strait of Hormuz in a move that would throw global oil and gas markets into chaos.\n\nScaramucci - who infamously spent just 10 days working for Trump in 2017 before he was fired - and his co-host, BBC presenter Katty Kay, recorded an emergency episode of their podcast 'The Rest Is Politics: US' to discuss the news.\n\nDuring the episode titled 'Trump’s Taking Us To WAR,' the former communications director claimed his selection of a Batman shift symbolizes how he feels about the decision to strike Iran.\n\n'I'm wearing my Batman shirt, Katty, intentionally.

We now have strong evidence.\n\nEven before President Donald Trump ordered B-2 bombers to attack Iran’s nuclear sites and plunge the United States into another Middle East war, it should have been apparent that he has never been committed to a foreign policy of realism and restraint. Other actions during the initial weeks of his second term already had unsettled supporters who hoped that Trump would adopt a more sober, “America first” policy. Enthusiastic backers believed his boast that he would promptly bring the war between Ukraine and Russia to an end. Their broader underlying assumption was that the United States would no longer waste American lives and financial resources on armed ideological crusades around the world.\n\nTrump’s subsequent waffling on the Ukraine-Russia conflict confirmed his lack of commitment to meaningful policy change that would take the United States out of the line of fire. His knee-jerk support for Israel’s brutal treatment of Palestinians did the same for expectations regarding a new, more balanced perspective on that issue. The president’s subsequent approval of U.S. support for Israel’s new war of aggression against Iran, along with his demand for Tehran’s “unconditional surrender,” should have eliminated any lingering doubt about his toxic hawkishness.\n\nExpectations for a sensible, restrained foreign policy by a Trump administration were always naïve. As I have pointed out in multiple articles over the years, Trump’s supposed commitment to a more realistic, cautious U.S. foreign policy was largely an illusion. He fostered that illusion whenever it served his political interests, while his opponents played their own role in the political charade by insisting that Donald Trump was an evil “isolationist” who was infecting the Republican Party and thereby undermining America’s noble leadership role in the world.\n\nHis actual conduct differed little from the policies of his openly hawkish, global interventionist predecessors. During his first term, Washington’s already bloated military budget continued to grow without interruption. Despite promising during the 2016 presidential campaign to end the futile and bloody U.S. intervention in Afghanistan, Trump did not even reach a peace accord with Taliban forces until the final year of his term. Meaningful U.S. troop withdrawal did not take place until he had already left the White House.\n\nTrump forged far closer U.S. military ties with Taiwan and embraced uncompromising policies toward the People’s Republic of China (PRC) on a wide range of economic, diplomatic, and security issues. He showed not a hint of receptivity to being more cordial toward Beijing.\n\nPerhaps the biggest gap between illusion and reality during Trump’s first term was the issue of policy toward Russia. Trump’s political opponents created and circulated the smear that he was soft on Russia at best and an outright Russian agent at worst. Once again, the president’s track record pointed to a totally different conclusion. Even on the Ukraine issue, Trump’s stance toward Moscow was disturbingly conventional. Indeed, in some ways it was more confrontational than the policy that Barack Obama pursued. Under Trump’s leadership, the United States transferred sophisticated weapons to Kyiv, trained Ukrainian troops, and conducted joint military exercises with Ukrainian forces. Obama had prudently declined to take any of those steps.\n\nBeyond the Ukraine issue, Trump’s policies were openly hostile to an assortment of Russia’s high-priority interests and objectives. Moscow regarded the continuation of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty, concluded during Ronald Reagan’s administration, as extremely important for protecting crucial Russian security needs. Trump withdrew the United States from that treaty. A similar pattern occurred with respect to the Open Skies agreement, a longstanding, confidence-building measure that had been in effect since Reagan’s administration. Trump’s dismissive treatment of arms control agreements that Russia considered essential directly contradicted the idea that he practiced appeasement toward the Kremlin.\n\nTrump’s hostility toward both arms control and overall policies toward Iran also was evident during the president’s first term. He scuttled the multilateral agreement that the major global powers had reached to limit Tehran’s nuclear program and assure that it remained peaceful. As an additional provocation, the White House ordered the assassination of a top Iranian general, Qasem Soleimani, a killing carried out while he was on a diplomatic mission to Iraq, a supposed U.S ally.\n\nGiven Trump’s flagrant animosity toward the government in Tehran, it should not be surprising that he has chosen Iran to be an early target for militarily aggression in his second term. He fully supports Israel’s new war of aggression against its Middle East neighbor and uncritically accepted Tel Aviv’s assertion that Iran was on the brink of building a nuclear arsenal. Yet most experts, initially including Tulsi Gabbard, his own appointee as Director of National Intelligence, strongly disputed that allegation.\n\nTrump’s supporters who backed him because of their assumption that he would pursue a foreign policy of realism and restraint need to acknowledge an egregious error in judgement. Even before the B-2 attacks, his foreign policy already more closely resembled the approach long embraced by ultra-hawkish neoconservatives than it did a strategy that cautious realists favor. Trump’s differences with neoconservatives are more stylistic than substantive. They prefer a more conventional, less abrasive, and less unilateral approach to international diplomacy than he does. That stylistic difference helps explain why such prominent neoconservatives as Dick and Liz Cheney ultimately supported Joe Biden and Kamala Harris instead of Trump. But Trump and his neocon critics fully share a commitment to war as the default option when dealing with any perceived adversary of the United States. His blatant act of military aggression against Iran was as predictable as it was irresponsible.\n\nProfessed realists who believed that Trump would reduce the danger of the United States becoming entangled in more ill-conceived global military interventions should have known better. Now, they are likely in for even more rude awakenings.\n\nDr. Ted Galen Carpenter is a contributing editor to 19FortyFive and a senior fellow at the Randolph Bourne Institute and the Libertarian Institute.

Now it is the Democrats who are distracted and back on their feet, with the party engaged in bitter infighting and struggling to come up with a unified strategy to oppose Trump. Meanwhile, Trump is pushing forward on all fronts, setting the agenda — just look at the recent bombing of nuclear sites in Iran — and putting together one of the most consequential presidencies in years.\n\nPart of the problem is that Democrats are still in a state of shock. Go back to last summer, when an internal coup resulted in President Joe Biden’s departure from the reelection race. Then go to November, when the party was stunned to lose to Trump. Then go to January-February-March of this year when they were overwhelmed by Trump’s audacious use of executive authority in his first months in office. Democrats are still playing catch-up.\n\nPerhaps their biggest problem is that they don’t have a big, unifying cause, like the Russia narrative, to use as a cudgel against the Trump administration. It is hard to overstate the daily damage the Russia affair did to Trump in 2017, and its absence today has left Democrats in a far weaker position than they were back then.\n\nOf course Democrats are trying. Some have adapted the lawfare they perfected during Trump’s time out of office; just this year, Democratic proxies have sued Trump or his administration around 300 times. The idea is to find a friendly judge — not too hard to do — to issue a nationwide injunction to stop Trump from doing whatever it is that Democrats oppose. The party has had a good deal of success so far, but it’s a short-term strategy, especially when they file preposterous cases that will lose in the appeals courts.\n\nRecently, we’ve seen a number of Democrats pursue a new effort to use 1960s-style civil disobedience to get themselves detained, arrested, handcuffed, or otherwise in trouble while bringing attention to what they say are the administration’s lawless ways. LaMonica McIver, Ras Baraka, Brad Lander, Alex Padilla, and others have tried it — so many that the Washington Post recently published a story headlined, “For Democrats, handcuffs are the latest symbol of resistance to Trump.”\n\nIt’s kind of funny, but not really — it’s more an indicator of the Democratic Party’s impotence in the face of the Trump presidency. And behind the embarrassing stories, Democrats have substantial problems that could render the party ineffective for quite a while.\n\nFirst, it has fallen behind in the money race — according to recent reports, the Democratic National Committee has $18 million in cash-on-hand compared to $67.4 million for the Republican National Committee. A top finance official with the Kamala Harris campaign recently told the New York Times that the party’s donors are seeing “headline after headline of incompetence and infighting, and I think that is a real problem not just for the DNC but for the larger Democratic brand.”\n\nAnother source close to the DNC told the New York Post, “We are six months in and we’re drowning. We have no clear path or plan. The midterms are going to come before we know it, and then we’re going to be really f***ed.”\n\nMany of the problems — and the bad headlines — concern the leadership of new DNC Chairman Ken Martin. A longtime head of the party in Minnesota, Martin seemed qualified enough, but his early months have been marked, according to critics, by too much squabbling and putting money in the wrong places.\n\nMartin got into a fight with David Hogg, the young progressive firebrand, and ended up complaining bitterly about Hogg’s treatment of him. “You essentially destroyed any chance I have to show the leadership that I need to,” Martin, his voice choking up, told Hogg on a party Zoom call in May. “The other night I said to myself for the first time, I don’t know if I want to do this any more.” \n\nOnce that became public, many Democrats must have wondered about Martin: This is the guy we chose to lead us in the incredibly tough battle against Donald Trump, and he’s getting weepy because David Hogg said mean things about him? No wonder one DNC member told Politico that Martin seemed “weak and whiny.” To make things worse, two big-money union heavyweights, Randi Weingarten of the teachers union and Lee Saunders of the public employees union, have both left their positions in the party.\n\nFinally, Democrats are still on the wrong side of a number of issues, like immigration, wokeism, and national security. At any moment, they seem in danger of taking another turn in the wrong direction. Take Tuesday’s Democratic primary for mayor of New York City. Politico recently reported that “Centrist Democrats are sounding the alarm that a surging democratic socialist mayoral candidate … could further set back the party’s already beleaguered national brand.” That candidate, Zohran Mamdani, who is affiliated with the Democratic Socialists of America, is a walking nightmare for Democrats who hope to win back voter support nationally.\n\nBack in 2017, in Trump’s first months in office, Democrats, even though they had just suffered a devastating defeat in the 2016 presidential election, didn’t spend as much time worrying about their brand. They had RussiaRussiaRussia to use against the new president, and a willing press to megaphone every wild accusation they could find. Of course, in the most fundamental sense, the Mueller investigation went nowhere when the special counsel could not establish that collusion ever occurred, much less that it involved any top Trump campaign officials. But that didn’t happen until 2019, giving Democrats and their media allies ample time to cripple Trump’s new presidency. Now, Democrats have lost again to Trump, but this time they are still searching for the magic issue to use against him.","summary":"MIRED IN INFIGHTING, WITH TRUMP FULL SPEED AHEAD, DEMOCRATS CAN&#8217;T FIND THEIR WAY. This newsletter is about the current dreadful state of the Democratic Party.

Recollections of that war — waged in part to find weapons of mass destruction that did not exist – flooded back for Tallwhiteman after President Donald Trump ordered weekend bombing strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities amid its escalating conflict with Israel.

The administration has indicated it wants to avoid getting pulled into all-out war. Tallwhiteman, who grew up on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation southeast of Billings, is sceptical. “Their idea is to eliminate the threat. Like Bush said in Iraq, We're going to eliminate the threat. We're going to find weapons of mass destruction and eliminate them.' Did that work the way he planned? No, obviously it didn't,” said Tallwhiteman.

The 30-year-old driver for a food distribution company said he usually votes Libertarian, but backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump last year. Across the US on Sunday, Americans expressed a mixture of support, apprehension and anxiety over the bombings, which officials said caused severe damage to Iran's nuclear sites. Administration officials said the strikes left room for Iran to return to negotiations over its nuclear programme. Yet if the conflict spirals, it could test Trump's foreign diplomacy skills and also his support at home. B-2 bombers that participated in the weekend strikes returned home to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on Sunday. Nearby, retired Air Force veteran Ken Slabaugh said he was “100% supportive” of Trump's decision and the military personnel who carried it out. Slabaugh said Iran has showed resistance to negotiations over its nuclear programme for decades, a problem that he said Trump inherited. Iran can't be trusted, Slabaugh said, nor allowed to acquire nuclear weapons. “It simply had to be done,” he said of the strikes, adding that he's now concerned for members of the military around the world. “I'm proud of the guys and the gals that are doing the work out there. Nobody in the world does this like we do, and we have the freedom and liberty we enjoy because of that,” Slabaugh said. Meanwhile, hundreds of people gathered in New York's Times Square on Sunday to protest the bombings, waving signs that said “STOP THE WAR ON IRAN” and “TRUMP IS A WAR CRIMINAL”. Among them was Dana Cote, who was in the city when the Sept 11, 2001, terrorist attacks occurred. Cote worried that bombing Iran would “open a can of worms that we're not going to be able to close” and prompt extremists to again attack the US. A much smaller group of pro-Trump supporters gathered nearby. They held up flags for Israel and Trump, and used air horns to try to drown out the demonstrators. “I think it's the best thing that Trump could have done. It should have been done 40 years ago,” said Nancy Myer of New York. In Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Andrew Williams, 18, said he was surprised by the timing of the attack, given that many Republicans had expressed opposition to US involvement in the Israel-Iran war. Still, he thought it was necessary if Iran was building nuclear weapons. “If we are able to get rid of that, that is something we should do,” Williams said. Robert Wallette of Billings said Trump had “good reason” to conduct the bombing as a demonstration of American support for Israel. “Iran's evil, evil people. They hate Americans,” he said. Wallette, 69, a retired contract specialist at the federal Indian Health Service, said he hated Trump when the Republican was first elected because of his arrogant style. His perspective started to shift after Trump moved the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In 2024, Wallette voted for Trump based on his promises to curb illegal immigration, putting him among the 60% of voters backing Trump last year in Yellowstone County, which includes Billings. Notwithstanding his support, Wallette was unsure if Trump can avoid the US getting drawn into a deeper conflict with Iran. “Other countries are getting involved and this may be out of his control,” he said. Kent Berame, 32, of Davie, Florida, said it was a little outrageous for Trump to go rogue and approve the attack without explicit support from Congress. He said he doesn't agree with the United States supporting Israel's recent attacks on Iran. “There's concern that we're putting troops in danger,” said Berame, a Democrat who owns his own marketing company. “And obviously there's a retaliatory response toward all of our bases over there.” Berame said it's frustrating that the US might be increasing hostilities with Iran just a few years after finally ending the war in Afghanistan. “I don't want to see any US soldiers in harm's way or in danger,” he said. Back in Billings, Trump voter Patty Ellman said she worries about the US getting sucked into another extended conflict. “We have enough going on in America to get into other countries' wars.

The source said the topic of the gubernatorial race is dominating many of the conversations she is having simply because of the fast-approaching 2026 match-up. \n\nEither way, the sources say Harris is sticking to a self-imposed end-of-summer deadline in deciding whether to wade into the already-crowded governor’s race, where the contest includes former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa and former California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who was also a member of the Biden administration as secretary of Health and Human Services.\n\nThe former vice president is planning to take some time off in July, when sources say she hopes to further reflect on the next step in her political career. \n\nHarris’s office did not comment for this story.\n\nIn recent weeks, Harris has been participating in a string of conversations about the political climate in the state and the issues on the minds of Californians, the sources say. She has been particularly interested in the issues facing younger voters and has been holding lengthy discussions about the future of artificial intelligence (AI). \n\nHarris has kept a relatively low profile in recent months after a devastating loss in the 2024 presidential election a race she thought she could win. While California has been in the headlines for a rash of news events, including the protests over Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids in Los Angeles earlier this month and the wildfires that ravaged major swaths of the state in January, the extent of Harris’s public involvement has been posts on social platform X. \n\n“Los Angeles is my home,” Harris wrote in a statement earlier this month on the protests. “And like so many Americans, I am appalled at what we are witnessing on the streets of our city. Deploying the National Guard is a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos.” \n\n“In addition to the recent ICE raids in Southern California and across our nation, it is part of the Trump administration’s cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division,” she added. \n\nThose close to the former vice president say she has been appalled by the Trump administration’s bold moves, like deploying the National Guard. Harris has told confidants that she feels the president is governing by loyalty and retribution and that such actions will propel her to reenter public service. \n\n“This moment almost requires her to do it,” one source close to Harris said. \n\nAt the same time, if she chooses to enter the race, her confidants know she will have to contend with looming narratives about whether she helped conceal former President Biden’s decline, something Republicans continue to press her on.\n\nEven one of her would-be opponents, Villaraigosa, has made it a talking point.\n\n“Voters deserve to know the truth, what did Kamala Harris and Xavier Becerra know, when did they know it, and most importantly, why didn’t either of them speak out? This cover up directly led to a second Donald Trump term,” Villaraigosa wrote in a post on X last month that took aim at two potential rivals.\n\nAgainst the backdrop of these questions, there’s a thought among some Democrats that a run for governor would be “a consolation prize” with Harris having been close to winning the presidency less than a year ago. Her confidants cringe at that sentiment, and they say Harris brushes off such commentary.\n\nA decision by Harris to run for governor would be significant, political observers say, because it could take a 2028 presidential run off the table. \n\n“I don’t think she could, with a straight face, run for governor in 2026 without making an absolute pledge that she would not run for president in 2028,” said Garry South, a California-based Democratic strategist.\n\nAn Emerson College poll in April revealed that 50 percent of Democratic voters in California would support Harris in a gubernatorial run. A separate survey from Politico/UC Berkeley Citrin Center also released in April revealed that 33 percent of Democratic voters in California would be “joyful” about a Harris bid and 41 percent would be “mostly excited.” \n\nThough those polls show she would be the clear front-runner in the race, some Democrats say they don’t think that’s enough for her to maintain a clear field.\n\n“She would start out, at least initially, as the front-runner. There’s no doubt about it because she has 100 percent name ID in California,” South said. “I think there are real mixed feelings about her among California Democrats, and I think those mixed feelings would grow if she actually got into the race.” \n\n“She doesn’t come into this as an 800-pound gorilla,” he added.\n\nEven as some close to her say she’s leaning toward running, some former aides and longtime observers in the state say they doubt Harris will run for governor because she has been, as one former aide put it, “absent” from the events that have dominated the state. \n\nIn the face of this month’s protests in Los Angeles, for example, Harris was in the Hamptons attending the wedding of Huma Abedin and Alex Soros two big names within Democratic circles. In April, Harris spoke at a gala before hundreds of donors in San Francisco and made no mention of state issues or political affairs. \n\n“She’s the kind of person that if she’s going to do something, she’s very serious about it, focused on it,” said Elizabeth Ashford, a California-based communications adviser who served as Harris’s chief of staff when she was the state’s attorney general. “It just seems to me that this would be a summer of reintroducing herself as a Californian to Californians if that were really front of mind.”\n\nIn the months since she left office, Harris has made most of her public appearances outside of California. \n\nLast month, the former vice president spoke at a closed-room real estate conference in Australia following a surprise Met Gala appearance in New York. She was in Las Vegas for a conference on AI in March and engaged with students at a Maryland community college in December. \n\nHer loss of the presidency in November raises questions for some California Democrats about how she will address the issue they say Democratic voters in the state care most about.\n\n“I think California Democrats right now want somebody who’s going to get in Trump’s face,” said South, the California-based Democratic strategist. “But I’m not sure that someone who just lost pretty badly to Donald Trump can posit themselves as the best counter against Donald Trump if they were to be governor of California.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nKamala Harris is leaning toward entering the California gubernatorial race, sources familiar&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris Considers Running in California Governor&#8217;s Race first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/kamala-harris-considers-running-in-california-governors-race/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/rewrite-this-title-Kamala-Harris-gives-California-governors-race-a.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-23 00:13:32","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.191},{"id":334126110,"title":"Australia Backs US Military Action on Iran Nuclear Sites, Confirms Wong","text":"Support Our Cause\n\nSupport Our Cause\n\n Search for:\n\n HomeNewsAUAustralia Backs US Military Action on Iran Nuclear Sites, Confirms Wong\n\nAustralia Backs US Military Action on Iran Nuclear Sites, Confirms Wong\n\n \n\n Up next \n\n \n\n \n\nKamala Harris Considers Running in California Governor’s Race\n\n Published on 23 June 2025\n\n Internewscast \n\nShare this @internewscast.com\nFacebookXRedditPinterest\n\nForeign Minister Penny Wong has expressed the government’s backing for the United States’ military actions against Iran’s nuclear sites.\n\nIn her statements this morning on Today, Wong indicated that the United States specifically targeted locations pertinent to Iran’s nuclear activities.\n\n“We support action to prevent Iran getting a nuclear weapon,” Wong said.\n\n“We are aware of the UN nuclear watchdog’s reports … indicating that Iran is refining uranium to near-military grade levels … sufficient for producing multiple nuclear arms.”\n\nDonald Trump confirmed the US strikes on Iran on Sunday.(Maxar Technologies)\n\nWong also noted the difficult situation of thousands of Australians who remain stranded in both Israel and Iran, affirming that Australia continues its efforts to assist in their evacuation.\n\n“Obviously, this is a highly risky and precarious situation, and my heart goes out to Australians in Iran and in Israel, and to their friends and families in Australia who are so deeply worried about them,” Wong said.\n\nThe security situation in Israel meant land crossing were not possible, but the government was working on trying to arrange contingency flights, Wong said.\n\n“There are reports … of airspace opening for Israel for a limited period.

The current Senate is the second oldest, with an average age of 63, and the House of Representatives is the third oldest, averaging 57 years of age, since the foundation of the US Congress in 1789. \n\nIt was president Ronald Reagan who, at the ripe old age of 78, in 1984 said he would not make age an issue during his presidential campaign against Walter Mondale. But while candidates may not make age an explicit issue during the campaign it certainly dominates their time in office. \n\nCurrently, about a third of the federal budget is dedicated to Social Security and Medicare payments which benefits those over 60, who make up less than 20% of the US population. These costs are mainly borne by young workers and employers even as older generations are financially better off than younger cohorts. \n\nTalk of cuts to such programmes are usually met with voter rage as candidates and office holders alike walk a tightrope in accommodating older voters and promising to balance budgets.\n\n Aside from international examples, Ireland offers a closer look at gerontocratic rule.\n\n A recent study carried out by the Electoral Commission reveals the older generation’s outsized influence on Irish elections. Titled the National Election & Democracy Study General Election 2024, the findings, carried out by Red C, indicates that 90% of those aged 65+ voted in last year’s general election.  But while the older generation enthusiastically headed to polling stations in their droves, young people, for the most part, stayed at home - their parents’ home, that is.  \n\nHousing between the generations\n\nHousing, the top electoral issue, underscores this divide. While voters express frustration with the crisis, 89% of those who turned out to vote are homeowners, with two-thirds reporting stable or improved economic conditions. Since the Troika’s exit in 2013, house prices have doubled, boosting wealth for homeowners — mostly older generations. \n\nMeanwhile, wages, especially for younger people, have lagged, rising just 27% since the crash from 2013-2022. The ESRI highlights Ireland’s stark generational homeownership gap: nearly 80% of those over 40 own homes, compared to just a third of those under 40. \n\nIn 1993, 70% of 25-34-year-olds were homeowners; by 2016, 60% of this group were renters, and the 2022 census showed over two-thirds of 18-34-year-olds still living with their parents - way above the EU average.  With 30% of Ireland’s population aged 18-39, the over-40 cohort, around 10% larger, dominates both homeownership and voter turnout.  \n\nDespite desperate attempts by the Millennial ‘TikTok Teesh’ Simon Harris to appeal to the youth, the 34th Dáil’s power rests on older homeowners’ support.  This influence is reflected in government policy. \n\nIn 2020, nearly every party opposed raising the state pension age from 66, with Sinn Féin, popular among under-65s, pledging to lower it to 65. A post-election Commission on Pensions recommended gradually raising the age to 67 by 2031. With the average life expectancy standing at 87, it only makes sense that the pension age rise concurrently.  \n\nYet the government, seemingly wary of older voters, rejected the recommendation, offering higher pensions for those retiring at 70 and proposing PRSI hikes — largely borne by younger workers. With birth rates declining and the worker-to-pensioner ratio projected to drop to 2:1 by 2050, PRSI costs will likely climb, further impacting working age people.  \n\nPensions, like housing, favour the old. Only 30% of 20-24-year-olds have some sort of pension plan, compared to over 70% of 45-54-year-olds, often tied to property wealth. Maybe the government’s refusal to raise the pension age is informed by the last time geriatric rage was elicited. \n\nFollowing the crash, and the imposition of brutal austerity, the Fianna Fáil-Green-PD government did away with the automatic entitlement for over 70s to free healthcare and a medical card.  This sparked major protests with opposition leaders, including Fine Gael’s Enda Kenny and Labour’s Eamon Gilmore, addressing some demonstrators.  \n\nFearing the electoral repercussions, the coalition government backtracked on their plans but ploughed ahead with gruelling cuts for mainly younger, working-age people. \n\nShortly after the crash, Ireland registered one of the highest unemployment rates among those aged 15-24 at over 40%. Many young people emigrated — nearly 10% during the recession — rather than protest.\n\nThe housing trap\n\n Housing remains the starkest indicator of youth disenfranchisement. Average rents now exceed €2,000 monthly, and post-crash rules requiring 10-20% deposits trap young people in a cycle of paying more in rent than a mortgage would cost. \n\nHouse prices are seven times the average income, compared to 1.5 times in the 1980s.  A new report from the Central Bank of Ireland found that the wealthiest 10% of households held just below half of the total net wealth in 2024 mainly due to high house prices. \n\nAccording to the bank, Irish households have financial assets worth €570bn. For them, rising house prices are a positive development with politicians equally richly rewarded at the ballot box.\n\n When Mary Lou McDonald proposed lowering house prices to €300,000, her party was accused of recklessness. Fine Gael Senator John Cummins warned: “We’d see our construction sector and economy crash.” \n\nSimilar sentiments were echoed by then Taoiseach Leo Varadkar when he stated that \"one person’s rent is another person’s income\" when voicing his opposition to rent caps.  Such Freudian slips reveal how politicians view housing: as an asset whose rising price must be maintained in order to satisfy the equity of a homeowners’ property and yields for a landlord.  \n\nMeanwhile, those desperate to get onto the property ladder and stuck paying gargantuan rents are left scraping by and politically unrepresented. \n\nWhile some younger candidates did manage to get elected during the last general election, including Barry Heneghan at age 27, the spectre of career politician and septuagenarian Michael Lowry giving Paul Murphy the two fingers in the Dáil chamber as the new government was formed could not have shown more clearly whose interests they will represent.\n\n Minister of state for international development and the diaspora, Neale Richmond, recently mentioned that Ireland’s greatest export was its people. With 70% of young people in Ireland contemplating emigration, you can expect bumper figures for exports in the future if this situation continues.  \n\nThe fissures between old and young are widening with housing causing the rupture and youth despair filling the crevice.  Going back to first principles and re-examining who housing policy should represent and what the purpose of a home is would go a long way in stabilising that societal chasm.","summary":"Gap between the haves and have-nots in Irish society is beginning to be defined generationally as our ageing politicians look after older voters, writes Theo McDonald","url":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/opinion/commentanalysis/arid-41654162.html","image":"https://www.irishexaminer.com/cms_media/module_img/9338/4669316_9_seoimage1x1_Godfrey_27s_20gospel_20lowry_20in_20dail.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-22 23:47:00","author":"Irishexaminer.com,Theo McDonald","authors":["Irishexaminer.com","Theo McDonald"],"language":"en","source_country":"ie","sentiment":0.067},{"id":334119740,"title":"American Reactions to US Strikes on Iran: Concerns Mixed with Support for Israel","text":"BILLINGS, Mont. – Layton Tallwhiteman vividly remembers his early childhood when, in 2003, he watched the news at his uncle’s home in Montana as the U.S. launched airstrikes on Baghdad, marking the beginning of the Iraq war.\n\nThose memories came rushing back for Tallwhiteman after President Donald Trump sanctioned bombings on Iran’s nuclear sites amid its intensifying tensions with Israel, recalling a conflict partly driven by the search for non-existent weapons of mass destruction.\n\nWhile the administration has expressed a desire to avoid being entangled in a full-scale war, Tallwhiteman, who grew up on the Northern Cheyenne Reservation near Billings, remains doubtful.\n\n“Their idea is to eliminate the threat. Like Bush said in Iraq, ‘We’re going to eliminate the threat. We’re going to find weapons of mass destruction and eliminate them.’ Did that work the way he planned? No, obviously it didn’t,” said Tallwhiteman. The 30-year-old driver for a food distribution company said he usually votes Libertarian, but backed Democrat Kamala Harris over Trump last year.\n\nAcross the U.S. on Sunday, Americans expressed a mixture of support, apprehension and confoundment at the bombings, which officials said caused severe damage to Iran’s nuclear sites. Administration officials said the strikes left room for Iran to return to negotiations over its nuclear program. Yet if the conflict spirals, it could test Trump’s foreign diplomacy skills and also his support at home.\n\n‘It had to be done’\n\nB-2 bombers that participated in the weekend strikes returned home to Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri on Sunday. Nearby, retired Air Force veteran Ken Slabaugh said he was “100% supportive” of Trump’s decision and the military personnel who carried it out.\n\nSlabaugh said Iran has showed resistance to negotiations over its nuclear program for decades, a problem that he said Trump inherited. Iran can’t be trusted, Slabaugh said, nor allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\n“It simply had to be done,” he said of the strikes, adding that he’s now concerned for members of the military around the world.\n\n“I’m proud of the guys and the gals that are doing the work out there. Nobody in the world does this like we do, and we have the freedom and liberty we enjoy because of that,” Slabaugh said.\n\nIn Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, Andrew Williams, 18, said he was surprised by the timing of the attack given that many Republicans had expressed opposition to U.S. involvement in the Israel-Iran war. Still, he thought it was necessary if Iran was building nuclear weapons.\n\n“If we are able to get rid of that, that is something we should do,” Williams said.\n\nRobert Wallette of Billings said Trump had “good reason” to conduct the bombing as a demonstration of American support for Israel.\n\n“Iran’s evil, evil people. They hate Americans,” he said.\n\nConcern about conflict spinning out of control\n\nWallette, 69, a retired contract specialist at the federal Indian Health Service, said he hated Trump when the Republican was first elected because of his arrogant style.\n\nHis perspective started to shift after Trump moved the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. In 2024, Wallette voted for Trump based on his promises to curb illegal immigration, putting him among the 60% of voters backing Trump last year in Yellowstone County, which includes Billings.\n\nNotwithstanding his support, Wallette was unsure if Trump can avoid the U.S. getting drawn into a deeper conflict with Iran.\n\n“Other countries are getting involved and this may be out of his control,” he said.\n\nKent Berame, 32, of Davie, Florida, said it was a little outrageous for Trump to go rogue and approve the attack without explicit support from Congress. He said he doesn’t agree with the United States supporting Israel’s recent attacks on Iran.\n\n“There’s concern that we’re putting troops in danger,” said Berame, a Democrat who owns his own marketing company. “And obviously there’s a retaliatory response toward all of our bases over there.”\n\nBerame said it’s frustrating that the U.S. might be increasing hostilities with Iran just a few years after finally ending the war in Afghanistan.\n\n“I don’t want to see any U.S. soldiers in harm’s way or in danger,” he said.\n\nBack in Billings, Trump voter Patty Ellman said she worries about the U.S. getting sucked into another extended conflict. \n\n“We have enough going on in America to get into other countries’ wars. Let’s just take care of us right now,” she said.\n\nEllman, a 61-year-old who stepped in as caregiver for her ex-husband after he suffered a stroke, said the U.S. should retaliate if attacked, but otherwise stay out of Iran’s conflict with other countries.\n\n“That’s their business,” she said. “We need to worry about Americans and how we’re going to survive and are we going to have Social Security.”\n\nWith contributions from David Fischer in Davie, Florida; Nicholas Ingram in Knob Noster, Missouri; and Mingson Lau in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nBILLINGS, Mont. – Layton Tallwhiteman vividly remembers his early childhood when, in&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: American Reactions to US Strikes on Iran: Concerns Mixed with Support for Israel first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/american-reactions-to-us-strikes-on-iran-concerns-mixed-with-support-for-israel/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Americans-react-to-US-strikes-on-Iran-with-worry-as.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-22 23:35:41","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.05},{"id":334131642,"title":"Democrats want new leaders. Plus, what Americans think of right-wing extremism","text":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n“Get mean”: Dem voters want new leaders\n\nDemocrats may be divided on who should lead the party in 2026 and beyond, but one thing is clear: They’re not pleased with the current bench. \n\nA new Reuters/Ipsos poll reveals significant frustration among Democratic voters who believe their party is too focused on social issues—like transgender rights—and not nearly focused enough on the economy. That disconnect between what voters want and what they think party leaders care about could spell trouble, especially with a critical midterm election map approaching. \n\n Sixty-two percent of self-identified Democrats indicated the party’s leadership should be replaced. Just 24% disagreed. Meanwhile, only 30% of Republicans were dissatisfied with their party’s leadership, even after months of chaos under President Donald Trump. \n\nThe poll found that Democrats want the party to concentrate more on everyday needs, particularly the economy and taxing the rich—issues progressives have long championed. However, voters don’t believe party leaders are delivering. For instance, while 86% of Democrats say overhauling the tax code so that wealthy Americans and large corporations pay more should be a top priority, only 72% think party leaders view it that way. \n\nThe gap is even more pronounced when it comes to reducing corporate influence in politics: 73% of Democrats desire limits on contributions to super PACs, but just 58% believe leadership is aligned. \n\n“Voters are very impatient right now,” said Mark Riddle of Future Majority, a Democratic-aligned research group. “They want elected officials at all levels to address the cost of living, kitchen-table issues, and affordability.”\n\nIn short, Democrats want their party to be more assertive on progressive economic policies—affordable child care, cheaper prescription drugs, improved transit, and universal health insurance. But they feel the party’s priorities do not align with theirs. \n\nThen there’s the culture war. Only 17% of Democrats feel that allowing transgender people to compete in girls’ and women’s sports should be a priority. However, 28% believe party leaders treat it as such. That gap, while frustrating, reflects other polling and places transgender Americans in the crossfire of an issue that they didn’t ask to be politicized.\n\nSome Democratic voters told Reuters that the party could borrow from Trump’s tactics.\n\n“A lot of Trump’s success has been with populist messages,” one voter from Baltimore said. “I think there’s [a] similar populist message Democrats can have.”\n\nAnother voter, from Phoenix, expressed it more bluntly: He just wants Democrats to “get mean” and stop playing nice with Trump and the GOP.\n\nExtremism isn’t equal—and Americans know it\n\nAmericans recognize political extremism on both sides—but they’re more afraid of one than the other.\n\nAccording to a recent YouGov poll, 55% of U.S. adults say they’re at least somewhat afraid of right-wing extremism, compared to 49% who say the same about left-wing extremism. And when you flip the numbers, the gap gets even clearer: 36% say they’re not at all afraid of left-wing extremism, compared to just 31% who say that about the right. That gives left-wing extremism a net concern score of +13, while right-wing extremism scores a +24.\n\nThat aligns with what we’ve seen in real life. One of the most direct ways to assess the danger of political extremism is by tallying the lives it has claimed. And here, the numbers are stark.\n\nSince 9/11, far-right extremists have killed at least 130 people in the U.S.—more than any other political cause, including jihadists, according to a 2023 analysis by the Brookings Institution. The list includes mass shootings, bomb plots, and high-profile attacks like the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, where members of far-right groups like the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, alongside conspiracy theorists and hardcore Trump supporters, attempted to overturn a democratic election.\n\nThe violence hasn’t stopped. Just last weekend, Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband were shot and killed in what officials are calling a “politically motivated assassination.” A state senator and his wife were also shot but survived their injuries. The alleged gunman, who echoed GOP talking points online, appears to have targeted them for their political views, though investigators have yet to determine his exact motive.\n\nAn added wrinkle with right-wing extremism is its foothold within institutions. While most military and law enforcement personnel reject these ideologies, even a small number of extremists in uniform pose a serious threat, especially given their positions on the frontlines of combatting violence.\n\nYes, left-wing violence exists, and nebulous groups like antifa are often cited by critics. But there’s no real equivalence. In recent years, white supremacists, anti-government radicals, and other far-right actors have been more violent, more lethal, and more politically destabilizing.\n\nAnd it seems the public is starting to notice.\n\nVoters see through both sides\n\nNeither party has a clear edge when it comes to honesty, according to a new NBC News Decision Desk poll powered by SurveyMonkey.\n\nThe poll shows most Americans think politicians in both parties are, more often than not, dishonest. Forty-eight percent of adults say that description fits Republicans, while 44% say the same of Democrats. Around 20%, meanwhile, say they see politicians from either party as “sometimes or always honest.”\n\nRoughly one-third of Americans say politicians from both parties are “about equally honest and dishonest.”\n\nIn other words, cynicism runs deep. \n\nAnd it cuts across party lines. Majorities of both Democrats and Republicans say politicians from their own party are dishonest at least some of the time. Twenty-two percent of Republicans say GOP politicians are sometimes or always dishonest, compared to 14% of Democrats who say the same about their side.\n\nAmong Trump and MAGA-aligned Republicans, 20% say GOP politicians are dishonest. That figure climbs to 25% among Republicans who identify more with the party than with Trump. On the left, progressives are more skeptical than party loyalists: 18% say Democratic politicians are sometimes or always dishonest, compared to just 11% of those who align more closely with the party.\n\nThe new numbers reflect a volatile political mood, one where distrust is fueling insurgent candidates and backlash against incumbents. \n\nTrump, who built his brand on attacking the establishment and often spreading falsehoods, is back in the White House. Meanwhile, former President Joe Biden, who launched his 2020 campaign on a promise of “truth over lies,” now faces growing criticism over whether he was honest about his cognitive health. He’s brushed off those concerns as simply “wrong.”\n\nNo wonder Americans don’t think either party has their back. When asked which party fights for people like them, the largest group—37%—say neither. Twenty-four percent picked the Democratic Party, 22% the GOP, and 18% say both.\n\nBoth parties are underwater with voters. Among adults, 57% view the Democratic Party unfavorably, though there are signs that could shift. The GOP fares no better, with 56% saying they view Republicans negatively.\n\nIn a climate like this, honesty isn’t just scarce—it’s up for grabs.\n\nAny updates?\n\n Americans aren’t buying what Republicans are selling. A new Pew Research Center survey finds that nearly one-half of U.S. adults (49%) oppose the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the brutal budget that has already passed the House and is now sitting in the Senate. Just 29% support it. That’s not surprising. The Trump-backed plan could slash Medicaid for millions, hurt vulnerable communities, and shower benefits on the rich—so, yes, people are skeptical. Most respondents (55%) said they believe the bill would mostly help high-income earners while leaving everyone else behind. Only 24% think the bill would benefit them personally, while 47% say it would make their lives worse. Another 26% say it wouldn’t impact them either way.\n\n California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s 2028 presidential hopes might be gaining traction. A new Morning Consult poll shows his support among Democratic voters rising to 11%—up from just 5% in March—putting him in second place behind Vice President Kamala Harris, who leads with 34%. Newsom now narrowly tops Pete Buttigieg, who dropped to 7% from 10%. The bump comes as Newsom grabs national attention over his handling of the ICE raids and resulting protests in Los Angeles. Still, the race is far from settled: 26% of Democrats say they’d prefer someone else entirely, and 16% remain undecided. \n\n Democrats have made it clear they’re not playing into the GOP’s crusade over Biden’s health. But new polling suggests voters may want lawmakers to take these concerns more seriously. According to the latest Axios-Ipsos American Health Index, 74% of Americans say there should be a legal requirement for presidents to release their health records, and 81% support age limits for all federally elected officials. These numbers likely aren’t just about Biden—Trump’s had his share of gaffes, too. And let’s face it: Plenty of Democrats are either dying in office or serving well past the point of being fit to do so. Maybe this is one rare point of bipartisan agreement—Americans want their leaders to be healthy, mentally sharp, and ideally, not pushing 90.\n\nAmericans’ views of Trump aren’t exactly improving with time. And it’s not just about policy, though his “One Big Beautiful Bill,” the immigration raids in Los Angeles, and his meddling in a potential conflict between Iran and Israel haven’t helped.\n\nTurns out, a lot of people just don’t like him.\n\nAs of Friday, only 45.8% of the public said they approve of Trump, while 51.8% did not, according to election analyst Nate Silver’s polling average.","summary":"Survey Says is a weekly series rounding up the most important polling trends or data points you need to know about, plus a vibe check on a trend that’s driving politics.\n\n\n\n\n“Get mean”: Dem voters want new leaders\n\nDemocrats may be divided on who should lead the party in 2026 and beyond, but one thing is clear: They’re not pleased with the current bench. \n\n\n\nA new Reuters/Ipsos poll reveals significant frustration among Democratic voters who believe their party is too focused on social issues—like transgender rights—and not nearly focused enough on the economy.

While there are no specific or credible counter threats we are aware of at this time, we urge everyone to stay vigilant and report suspicious activity.'\n\nCalifornia has the largest population of Iranians in the U.S. with just over 200,000 residents. \n\nWhitmer also posted about the operation without directly commenting on Trump, noting that her 'top priority is the safety and security of the people of Michigan.' She stuck to a statement of 'monitoring the situation closely' without weighing in on the merits of the decision.\n\nKamala Harris' 2024 running mate Tim Walz directed Minnesota safety teams to be on 'heightened alert' for potential threats to Minnesota and also pledged to monitor the situation.\n\nDuring last year's vice presidential debate, Walz criticized Trump for withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, arguing that this move allowed Iran to get closer to developing a nuclear weapon. He declined to return to that line of attack on Sunday.\n\nFollowing the President’s action in Iran, California’s State Threat Assessment Center is actively monitoring for any potential impacts in California.

The idea that Iran, the world's largest sponsor of terror, would have a nuclear weapon, would not only destabilize the Middle East, but it would create risk for American interests at home and abroad. And so it is good if Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon,' he added.\n\nBut he made sure to also say that the Trump administration owns full responsibility for what comes next. \n\nCongressional Democrats have complained much more loudly about Trump's strikes.

The Office of Personnel Management tracks when political appointees transition to career positions—a process often referred to as “burrowing in” to the bureaucracy—and Samantha Goldstein did so in 2023.\n\nGoldstein went from senior counsel at the Office of Legal Policy in the Department of Justice to attorney-advisor at the Office of Legal Counsel in the DOJ. \n\nOPM approved her move on Jan. 15, 2023. Goldstein received a pay bump from $110,460 annually to $127,942 annually. \n\nAccording to her LinkedIn profile, Goldstein left the DOJ in July 2024 to serve as deputy legal advisor on Biden’s National Security Council until February, when she joined the Department of Defense as associate deputy general counsel. \n\nGoldstein graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School in 2013, and clerked for two U.S. appeals courts: the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals. She interned with the left-leaning NAACP Legal Defense Fund in 2016 and served as a special counsel for Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., in 2018. Between these two positions and before she joined the Justice Department, Goldstein worked at the firm O’Melveny & Myers. Legistorm confirms this history.\n\nDuring her second stint at O’Melveny, Goldstein wrote a Washington Post op-ed with Walter Dellinger, a partner at O’Melveny who had worked in the Clinton administration. (Trump fired Dellinger’s son Hampton, who had served as the special counsel in the Office of Special Counsel, earlier this year, sparking a legal battle.) In that op-ed, Goldstein and Dellinger insisted that Trump is “unfit to hold office.”\n\n“In the face of an unprecedented attack on American democracy by a hostile foreign power, Donald Trump and those who worked for him both as a candidate and a president failed to defend the United States,” they wrote regarding Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s report into accusations of collusion between Trump and Russia. “For this alone, he is unfit to hold office.”\n\nGolstein and Dellinger wrote that the Mueller report “demonstrates that the president and his closest aides violated … fundamental duties imposed by their oaths of office,” namely the duty to protect and defend the Constitution “against all enemies foreign and domestic.” \n\nDeep State Opposition\n\nA recent poll found that a whopping 75% of Washington, D.C.-based federal employees making $75,000 or more per year who voted for Democrat presidential nominee Kamala Harris in November said they would not follow a lawful Trump order if they considered it bad policy.\n\nWhile some political appointees who took “career” positions may faithfully work for the U.S. government under any president, this poll suggests that some staff inside the federal government may work against the goals of the current president, in this case Donald Trump.\n\nFurthermore, a recent Foundation for Government Accountability study found that Democrat employees outnumber Republican employees by a 2-to-1 margin across federal agencies. In the 2024 presidential election, 84% of the money that federal employees gave in political contributions went to Harris.\n\nFederal workers enjoy workplace protections that make them very difficult to fire. The new administration is seeking to reform these rules to enable the president to fulfill his duties as head of the executive branch without facing opposition from hostile bureaucrats.\n\nGoldstein did not respond to a request for comment from The Daily Signal by publication time.

Progressives demanded unified opposition before President Trump announced U.S. strikes against Tehran's nuclear program, but party leaders were treading more cautiously. U.S. leaders of all stripes have found common ground for two decades on the position that Iran could not be allowed to obtain a nuclear weapon. The longtime U.S. foe has supported groups that have killed Americans across the Mideast and threatened to destroy Israel. But Trump’s announcement Saturday that the U.S. had struck three nuclear sites could become the Democratic Party’s latest schism, just as it was sharply dividing Trump's isolationist “Make America Great Again” base from more hawkish conservatives. Ken Martin, chair of the Democratic National Committee, noted that in January, Trump suggested the U.S. could “measure our success not only by the battles we win, but also by the wars that we end, and perhaps most importantly, the wars we never get into.” “Today, against his own words, the president sent bombers into Iran,” Martin said in a statement. “Americans overwhelmingly do not want to go to war. Americans do not want to risk the safety of our troops abroad.” Sen. Peter Welch, a Vermont Democrat, said the U.S. entering the war in Iran “does not make America more secure.” “This bombing was an act of war that risks retaliation by the Iranian regime,” Welch said in a statement. While progressives in the lead-up to the military action had staked out clear opposition to Trump's potential intervention, the party leadership played the safer ground of insisting on a role for Congress before any use of force. Martin's statement took a similar tack, saying, \"Americans do not want a president who bypasses our constitution and pulls us towards war without Congressional approval. Donald Trump needs to bring his case to Congress immediately.” Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine called Trump's actions “horrible judgment\" and said he'd “push for all senators to vote on whether they are for this third idiotic Middle East war.” Many prominent Democrats with 2028 presidential aspirations had been silent on the Israel-Iran war, even before Trump's announcement — underscoring how politically tricky the issue can be for the party. “They are sort of hedging their bets,” said Joel Rubin, a former deputy assistant secretary of State who served under President Obama and is now a strategist on foreign policy. “The beasts of the Democratic Party’s constituencies right now are so hostile to Israel’s war in Gaza that it’s really difficult to come out looking like one would corroborate an unauthorized war that supports Israel without blowback.” Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Fremont) had called Trump's consideration of an attack “a defining moment for our party.” Khanna had introduced legislation with Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) that called on the Republican president to “terminate” the use of U.S. armed forces against Iran unless “explicitly authorized” by a declaration of war from Congress. Khanna used Trump’s campaign arguments of putting American interests first when the congressman spoke to Theo Von, a comedian who has been supportive of the president and is popular among Trump supporters, particularly young men. “That’s going to cost this country a lot of money that should be being spent here at home,” said Khanna, who is said to be among the many Democrats considering seeking the presidential nomination in 2028. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who twice sought the Democratic presidential nomination, had pointed to Trump’s stated goal during his inaugural speech of being known as “a peacemaker and a unifier.” \"Supporting Netanyahu’s war against Iran would be a catastrophic mistake,” Sanders said, referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Sanders reintroduced legislation prohibiting the use of federal money for force against Iran, insisted that U.S. military intervention would be unwise and illegal and accused Israel of striking unprovoked. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York signed on to a similar bill from Sanders in 2020, but so far was holding off this time. Some believed the party should stake out a clear antiwar stance. “The leaders of the Democratic Party need to step up and loudly oppose war with Iran and demand a vote in Congress,” said Tommy Vietor, a former Obama aide, on X. The staunch support from the Democratic administration of President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris for Israel’s war against Hamas loomed over the party's White House ticket in 2024, even with the criticism of Israel’s handling of the humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Trump exploited the divisions to make inroads with Arab American voters and Orthodox Jews on his way back to the White House. Today, the Israel-Iran war is the latest test for a party struggling to repair its coalition before next year’s midterm elections and the quick-to-follow kickoff to the 2028 presidential race. The party will look to bridge the divide between an activist base that is skeptical of foreign interventions and already critical of U.S. support for Israel and more traditional Democrats and independents who make up a sizable, if not always vocal, voting bloc. In a statement after Israel’s first strikes on Iran, Schumer said Israel has a right to defend itself and “the United States’ commitment to Israel’s security and defense must be ironclad as they prepare for Iran’s response.” Sen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) said that “the U.S. must continue to stand with Israel, as it has for decades, at this dangerous moment.\" Other Democrats have condemned Israel’s strikes and accused Netanyahu of sabotaging nuclear talks with Iran. They are reminding the public that Trump withdrew in 2018 from a multinational nuclear agreement that limited Tehran’s enrichment of uranium in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions negotiated during the Obama administration. “Trump created the problem,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) posted on X. A Pearson Institute/Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll from September 2024 found that about half of Democrats said the U.S. was being “too supportive” of Israel and about 4 in 10 said its level of support was “about right.” Democrats were more likely than independents and Republicans to say the Israeli government had “a lot” of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas. About 6 in 10 Democrats and half of Republicans said they felt Iran was an adversary with whom the U.S. was in conflict. Gomez Licon and Beaumont write for the Associated Press.
