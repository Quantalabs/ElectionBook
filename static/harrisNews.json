The decision is part of a “painful” restructuring process deemed necessary for the historic newspaper.\n\nRenowned for its pivotal role in the Watergate scandal that contributed to the downfall of former U.S. President Richard Nixon, The Washington Post will undergo substantial cuts within its newsroom. Executive editor Matt Murray indicated that these changes are essential for the publication’s future.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, the job cuts will affect about a third of the Post’s staff, with over 300 out of approximately 800 journalists facing layoffs. While The Washington Post has not confirmed the exact number of positions to be eliminated, the impact on the newsroom is expected to be significant.\n\nThis downsizing comes amid mounting challenges faced by traditional media outlets in the United States. Former President Donald Trump has frequently targeted journalists, labeling them as purveyors of “fake news,” and has initiated numerous lawsuits in response to how his presidency was covered.\n\nMeanwhile, Jeff Bezos, counted among the world’s wealthiest individuals, has seen his relationship with Trump grow closer during the latter’s second term. This connection has sparked controversy, notably with Amazon’s lucrative deals with Trump’s wife, Melania, including a reported $40 million for a documentary and an additional $35 million for marketing efforts this year.\n\nMurray emphasized that the restructuring at The Washington Post is indicative of the rapidly evolving economic landscape for news media, necessitating adaptation and change.\n\nThis “will help to secure our future…and provide us stability moving forward”, Murray said in a note to employees.\n\nHe cited changes to the news ecosystem, from individuals who “generate impact at low cost” to AI-generated content, as well as financial challenges that have already produced rounds of cost-cutting and buyouts at the Post.\n\n“The company’s structure is too rooted in a different era, when we were a dominant, local print product,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often wrote from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nOn Facebook, Marty Baron, the Post’s executive editor until 2021, wrote: “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organizations.”\n\nSports reporters, international correspondents let go\n\nMost of the paper’s journalists overseas were let go, including its entire Middle East roster and its Kyiv-based Ukraine correspondent.\n\nSports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper’s daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported.\n\nMurray said the Post would now focus on politics, national security, technology, investigations, and business, among other topics.\n\nBut a reporter who covered Amazon — currently valued at $3.7 trillion — was let go.\n\n“These layoffs are not inevitable.

In an initial snafu, San Franciscans were asked to join him for a book event in New York.\n\nNewsom is not exactly venturing into hostile territory. His first stop, Nashville, is a Democratic stronghold in conservative Tennessee. Still, the city has become a magnet for Californians looking to flee the state’s high cost of living or liberal politics, feeding a narrative about a Golden State exodus, which Newsom has dismissed as “California Derangement Syndrome.”\n\nThe foray into the South could demonstrate his popularity outside the coastal blue states — if he can pull in sizable crowds. Newsom also plans to boost Democratic candidates in each of the cities, particularly House and state legislative contenders, to burnish his standing as a national party figure during the midterm elections.\n\nAnd though Newsom is not officially running for president, the subtext of his likely 2028 bid is not especially subtle as he puts in face time in South Carolina, an influential Democratic primary state, and Georgia, a presidential battleground.\n\nNewsom, who has been to South Carolina twice in the last two years, is bypassing the larger cities of Charleston and Columbia to visit a region of the state he has not yet visited. Rock Hill sits just outside of Charlotte, North Carolina — another hotly-contested state in presidential and statewide races.\n\nHe is not alone among potential 2028 hopefuls in looking to the South for book promotion. Kamala Harris, whose events for her latest book “107 Days” began in New York, has concentrated much of her extended book tour on the region, including stops in Mississippi and Louisiana.\n\nJeremy B.

And that’s a survival strategy, but it ultimately leads to irrelevance, at best,” Bezos said at his first staff town hall. “And at worst, it leads to extinction.”\n\nNow Post journalists are living out that grim reality while Bezos is missing in action.\n\nThe Amazon founder didn’t speak up last month when the FBI searched a Post reporter’s home, or respond to staff letters and pleas on X. He wasn’t on Wednesday’s Zoom call to discuss the Post’s “strategic reset” at the paper, which is expected to impact a third of staff, resulting in more than 300 journalist layoffs. However, Bezos was observed greeting Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth at Blue Origin’s Florida facilities on Monday, signaling that rockets, rather than reporters, were top of mind this week. \n\nThe Washington Post, like other legacy newspapers, had already endured painful rounds of cuts and buyouts when Bezos bought it from the Graham family, the much-admired stewards of paper. Many staffers were hopeful at the time to land a owner who is also one of the richest individuals on the planet, one even telling me, “It doesn’t seem like a terrible thing to have the security of a billionaire.”\n\nDespite making significant investments early on, and enduring Donald Trump’s first-term wrath, Bezos has appeared more determined to curry favor with the administration in the second term than bolster the Post. He clearly still has the money, with his net worth ballooning since 2013 from $25 billion to around $250 billion. \n\nHe just doesn’t seem to have the appetite. And with Wednesday’s deep cuts, Bezos went from once being lionized as the paper’s savior to vilified as its executioner.\n\n“We’re witnessing a murder,” Ashley Parker, one of the Post’s star White House reporters during Donald Trump’s first term, wrote as the paper’s management unveiled plans to gut the foreign, sports and metro desks, while eliminating the books section and “Post Reports” podcast. Parker is one of the marquee reporters who fled the Post to The Atlantic. Another former Post reporter, Liz Sly, wrote on X that what Bezos did “is a monstrosity” and “should be criminalized.” Sally Quinn, a legendary Post writer and wife of late editor Ben Bradlee, said on CNN that “everybody is in a state of grief.”\n\nIt’s been heartbreaking to watch one Post journalist after another reveal on X that they, too, have been laid off. I have reported on previous cuts at the Post, along with legacy newspapers like the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. But the magnitude of experience and talent shed from the Post’s newsroom at one time is on another, staggering scale. It’s also horrifying to see hundreds of journalist let go as the press comes under increasing threat in Trump’s second term.\n\nBezos did not respond to a request for comment through a representative. The Post said in a statement that the restructuring is “designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets the Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.”\n\nAmong the areas of “distinctiveness” the Post plans to lean into is “national security in DC and abroad,” according to a memo from executive editor Matt Murray. But it’s hard to see how national security coverage isn’t severely weakened by laying off the Ukraine bureau chief and Middle East staff, along with correspondents and editors at other foreign outposts.\n\nMurray also acknowledged that the Post has “grappled with financial challenges for some time.”\n\nWhile Post staff surely recognize the paper’s struggles, including reportedly losing $100 million 2024, they also fault management for a series of blunders, including paper’s hamfisted spiking of its Kamala Harris endorsement, resulting in hundreds of thousands of canceled subscriptions.\n\nMarty Baron, the paper’s acclaimed editor during the first Trump term, said Wednesday that Bezos’s “sickening efforts to curry favor with President Trump have left an especially ugly stain of their own,” providing “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nMany Post staffers and alums also blame CEO and publisher Will Lewis for the paper’s financial state, noting missteps such as his “third newsroom” initiative. “Everyone in journalism has had to face the same challenges,” said former reporter Shane Harris. “The Post is losing money because the people who run the Post don’t know what they’re doing.”\n\nLewis, who was in Davos last month, was also noticeably absent from Wednesday’s Zoom call to break the news to staff. That job was left to Murray and the paper’s HR chief. “This was handled with cowardice,” one longtime staffer told TheWrap. “Washington Post executives took no ownership this morning for the questionable strategic and business decisions they have made that put the Post behind.”\n\nAnother Post staffer told The Wrap that Bezos, Lewis and Murray “just spit on the grave of Katherine Graham and the legacy of the Washington Post,” a reference to the courageous late publisher who stood behind the newsroom in the face of government pressure during Watergate and the publication of the Pentagon Papers. The Post, this second staffer added, is “finished.”\n\nThe Post’s ambition to be a top global new organization does appear over, along with its ambition to deeply cover local news and Washington sports — coverage areas prized by many of its readers in the DC metro region. “I will have to learn a new way to read the paper, since I have started with the sports page since the late 1940s,” former publisher Don Graham wrote on Facebook, along with offering to help laid off journalists. \n\nThe Post still has the capacity to do standout journalism. Its reporters broke ground this past year in covering the Trump administration’s remaking of the federal workforce, his demolition of the East Wing, and Hegseth’s role in military strikes against alleged drug traffickers near Venezuela — the latter of which earned a rebuke from the Pentagon as it kicked off its first news conference for a more Trump-friendly press corp. The AP cheerily noted last April how, “after a year of turmoil, The Washington Post is taking note of its journalism again.”\n\nThe turmoil now under way didn’t have to happen. \n\nBezos, who owns a $500 million superyacht, and last year spent tens of millions on a lavish Venice wedding, could continue bankrolling the paper at its most recent headcount. His ex-wife, Mackenzie Bezos, has demonstrated the power of philanthropy, giving away $19 billion and counting. It also hasn’t been lost among staff in recent weeks, amid wide-scale panic over impending cuts, that Amazon MGM Studios was reportedly spending $35 million to market the “Melania” documentary, which it had paid $40 million to secure — itself a record amount. \n\n“Here we have one of the wealthiest people in the history of the universe, who could easily manage both his business and keep the Washington Post healthy. I just don’t know why he would fail to do that,” New Yorker editor David Remnick told TheWrap.\n\nRemnick began his reporting career at the Post in 1982, working across the metro, sports and style sections. He later became the paper’s Moscow correspondent, winning a Pulitzer Prize for his book, “Lenin’s Tomb.”\n\n“These big democratic institutions, these which we now call legacy media institutions, have all kinds of flaws. Nobody denies that,” Remnick said. “But they’re also precious and rare and if we’ve learned anything historically — and not just during the Trump administration, but historically — to undermine them and to erode them and to finally destroy them causes far greater destruction than we realize in the moment.”\n\n“We tend to fall into this habit, and particularly in the past year, with so many things happening in a given day and any given week, of not taking full account of their importance, that they become a one day news story at best,” he added. “I fear that’s what might happen here.”\n\n— Corbin Bolies contributed reporting","summary":"The Post’s centibillionaire owner is under fire as the paper dramatically scales back its newsroom and ambition\n\n\nThe post How Jeff Bezos Went from Washington Post Savior to Executioner | Analysis appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/media-platforms/journalism/jeff-bezos-washington-post-layoffs-analysis/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Jeff-Bezos-Wapo-Image.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 22:43:22","author":"Charles Del Vecchio,Michael Calderone","authors":["Charles Del Vecchio","Michael Calderone"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.237},{"id":399465646,"title":"Washington Post layoffs include entire Ukraine, Middle East bureaus","text":"The Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.\n\nThe Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and to weather changes in technology and user habits. “We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff members.\n\nHe outlined the changes in a companywide online meeting, and staff members then began getting emails with one of two subject lines — telling them their role was or was not eliminated.\n\nRumors of layoffs had circulated for weeks, ever since word leaked that sports reporters who had expected to travel to Italy for the Winter Olympics would not be going. But when official word came down, the size and scale of the cuts were shocking, affecting virtually every department in the newsroom.\n\n“It’s just devastating news for anyone who cares about journalism in America and, in fact, the world,” said Margaret Sullivan, a Columbia University journalism professor and former media columnist at the Post and The New York Times.\n\n“The Washington Post has been so important in so many ways, in news coverage, sports and cultural coverage.”\n\nMartin Baron, the Post’s first editor under its current owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, condemned his former boss and called what has happened at the newspaper “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nBezos, who has been silent in recent weeks amid pleas from Post journalists to step in and prevent the cutbacks, had no immediate comment.\n\nThe newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by Bezos, including pulling back from an endorsement of Kamala Harris, a Democrat, during the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump, a Republican, and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.\n\nA private company, the Post does not reveal how many subscribers it has, but it is believed to be roughly 2 million.\n\nThe Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.\n\nThe Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.\n\nEliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.\n\nThe Post’s Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.\n\nA half-century ago, the Post’s coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime Executive Editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country’s best feature writing.\n\nWord of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper’s Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote.\n\nLizzie Johnson, who wrote last week about covering a war zone in Ukraine without power, heat or running water, said she had been laid off, too.\n\nThe paper’s Ukraine bureau chief Siobhan O’Grady said it was “the honor of my life” to serve in the position, suggesting she too had been let go.\n\nAnger and sadness spread across the journalism world.\n\n“The Post has survived for nearly 150 years, evolving from a hometown family newspaper into an indispensable national institution, and a pillar of the democratic system,” Ashley Parker, a former Post journalist, wrote in an essay in The Atlantic. But if the paper’s leadership continues its current path, “it may not survive much longer.”\n\nFearing for the future, Parker was among the staff members who left the newspaper for other jobs in recent months.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which stopped print editions and went all-digital at the end of last year, announced that it was cutting 50 positions, or roughly 15% of its staff. Half of the eliminated jobs were in the newsroom.\n\nMurray said the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, the Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump’s changes to the federal workforce.\n\nThe company’s structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to the staff. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn’t kept up with consumer habits, he said.\n\n“Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nWhile there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos — for a “gutless” order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for “moral infirmity” and “sickening” efforts to curry favor with Trump.\n\n“Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron wrote. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.”\n\nBaron said he was grateful for Bezos’ support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president’s first term.\n\n“He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post’s mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,” Baron wrote. “He often declared that The Post’s success would be among the proudest achievements of his life. I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”","summary":"The Post’s executive editor Matt Murray called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and weather changes in technology and user habits.","url":"https://globalnews.ca/news/11652434/washington-post-layoffs-journalism-international/","image":"https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/CP175728816.jpg?quality=65&#038;strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 22:34:27","author":"Globalnews Digital,The Associated Press","authors":["Globalnews Digital","The Associated Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"ca","sentiment":-0.038},{"id":399467448,"title":"Washington Post cutting hundreds of jobs, as US media faces Trump pressure","text":"The Washington Post, owned by billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, announced major job cuts Wednesday, saying that “painful” restructuring was needed at the storied newspaper.\nThe newspaper, which gained legendary status when its reporting helped bring down President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal, will see “substantial” reductions in its newsroom, Executive Editor Matt Murray said.\nThe shrinking of The Washington Post comes as major traditional media outlets in the United States face intense pressure from President Donald Trump, who routinely denigrates journalists as “fake news” and has launched multiple lawsuits over coverage of his presidency.\nBezos, one of the world’s richest people, has become close to Trump in the Republican’s second term.

About a third of The Washington Post&apos;s staff will be laid off, including more than 300 of the roughly 800 journalists in the newsroom, The New York Times reported. The Post did not disclose how many people it would lay off. The shrinking of the Post comes as major traditional media outlets in the United States face intense pressure from President Donald Trump, who routinely denigrates journalists as \"fake news\" and has launched multiple lawsuits over coverage of his presidency. Bezos, one of the world&apos;s richest people, has become close to Trump in the Republican&apos;s second term. His Amazon behemoth controversially paid Trump&apos;s wife, Melania Trump, a reported $40 million for a documentary this year, along with another $35 million for marketing. Murray said the shifts at the Post reflect the radically changing economy for news media. This \"will help to secure our future...and provide us stability moving forward\", Murray said in a note to employees.

Sports, graphics and local news departments were sharply scaled back and the paper&apos;s daily podcast, Post Reports, was suspended, local media reported. Murray said the Post would now focus on politics, national security, technology, investigations, and business, among other topics. But a reporter who covered Amazon — currently valued at $3.7 trillion — was let go. \"These layoffs are not inevitable. A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach and its future,\" the labour union representing many Post journalists said in a statement. It called for supporters of the paper, acquired by Bezos in 2013, to rally outside its Washington D.C. headquarters at noon on Thursday. One Post reporter, speaking on condition of anonymity to Reuters, called the newly announced layoffs a \"bloodbath.\" The White House&apos;s communications director, Stephen Cheung, reacted to the news with ridicule. \"Just a reminder that printing fake news is not a profitable business model,\" he posted on X. Baron, the Post&apos;s former executive editor, said that Post owner Bezos had resisted \"brutal pressure\" from Trump in the past, but it was battered by \"ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top\". Bezos blocked an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris days before the 2024 election — breaking the so-called firewall of editorial independence, and a move seen as bending the knee to Trump. In response, loyal readers \"fled the Post. In truth, they were driven away,\" Baron said. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that 250,000 digital subscribers left the Post after it refrained from endorsing Harris and the paper lost around $100 million in 2024 as advertising and subscription revenues fell.

The Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.The Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.Eliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.The Post’s Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.A half-century ago, the Post's coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime Executive Editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country's best feature writing.Word of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper's Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote.Lizzie Johnson, who wrote last week about covering a war zone in Ukraine without power, heat or running water, said she had been laid off, too.Anger and sadness spread across the journalism world.“The Post has survived for nearly 150 years, evolving from a hometown family newspaper into an indispensable national institution, and a pillar of the democratic system,” Ashley Parker, a former Post journalist, wrote in an essay in The Atlantic. But if the paper’s leadership continues its current path, “it may not survive much longer.”IN CASE YOU MISSED IT | Veteran journalist Alisyn Camerota joins Scripps News as special events anchorFearing for the future, Parker was among the staff members who left the newspaper for other jobs in recent months.Also on Wednesday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which stopped print editions and went all-digital at the end of last year, announced that it was cutting 50 positions, or roughly 15% of its staff. Half of the eliminated jobs were in the newsroom.Murray said the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, the Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump's changes to the federal workforce.The company's structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to the staff. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn't kept up with consumer habits, he said.“Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”While there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos — for a “gutless” order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for “moral infirmity” and “sickening” efforts to curry favor with Trump.“Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron wrote. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.\"Baron said he was grateful for Bezos' support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president's first term.“He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post's mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,” Baron wrote. “He often declared that The Post's success would be among the proudest achievements of his life. I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”","summary":"The Washington Post has laid off one-third of its staff, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.","url":"https://www.scrippsnews.com/us-news/washington-post-cuts-a-third-of-its-staff-axes-sports-section-in-blow-to-a-legendary-news-brand","image":"https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/ec8ee2a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1024x538+0+40/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F13%2F73%2F34ff9ccb410d97cde5c917ac6f94%2Fap26014523261292.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 21:42:11","author":"AP via Scripps News Group","authors":["AP via Scripps News Group"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.195},{"id":399450280,"title":"Washington Post slashes staff","text":"The Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.\n\nThe Post’s executive editor, Matt Murray, called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and to weather changes in technology and user habits. “We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff members.\n\nHe outlined the changes in a companywide online meeting, and staff members then began getting emails with one of two subject lines — telling them their role was or was not eliminated.\n\nRumors of layoffs had circulated for weeks, ever since word leaked that sports reporters who had expected to travel to Italy for the Winter Olympics would not be going.

Vance about whether President Donald Trump was focusing too much on foreign policy during an interview that aired Wednesday.\n\nIranian forces attempted to seize an American oil tanker Tuesday, shortly after a United States Marine Corps F-35 shot down an Iranian drone approaching the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln. Vance told Kelly during Wednesday’s episode of “The Megyn Kelly Show” that President Donald Trump’s primary focus was “the home front.” (RELATED: Shellshocked Man With WW1 Munition In His Anus Causes Mass Evacuation)\n\n“What are we talking about Iran for? What do you mean America first? Let’s focus on our own problems, affordability, all these things,” Kelly said. “They think President Trump spent too much time focused on overseas issues anyway and they definitely don’t want to get involved in Iran. And then there’s a larger faction, another faction, that is also large that’s more neocon-y that says, ‘We missed an opportunity. We let those protesters down. You know, the window’s closing. We should be more aggressive militarily than we are right now.’ Where do you fall?”\n\nTrump has repeatedly boasted that he has ended multiple wars, and also directed a strike on Iranian nuclear facilities in Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan related to Iran’s effort to develop nuclear weapons in June.\n\n“First of all, I hear the criticisms out there that the administration is too focused on foreign policy. I just have to defend the president. I don’t think that’s true,” Vance responded. “I think that certainly when you’re the president of the United States, you do have to conduct foreign policy. We’re the most powerful country in the world.”\n\n“But what I see him every day, he’s laser-focused on how do we make the American people more prosperous and more secure in their own country. That’s what our immigration policy is about, which we’ve taken a raft of crap over,” Vance continued. “That’s what our crime policy is about. That’s, you know, even the foreign policy stuff. Much of the president’s foreign policy has been focused on reshoring industry, on using tariffs to force people to reinvest in the United States of America.”\n\nTrump announced Nov. 14 that tariffs on some imported grocery items would be suspended, citing progress in trade talks. Vance also explained why Trump took a such a hard line on Iran’s nuclear program.\n\n“Now, Iran specifically, like what should we do with Iran? Okay, a couple things. First of all, it’s the president’s decision, he will ultimately decide how we handle this particular Iranian situation just like he decided on Operation Midnight Hammer,” Vance said. “What he has been very clear on, if you go back to 2015, 2016, 2021, 2025, the president has said consistently, we can’t let these people have a nuclear weapon.” (RELATED: Pentagon Reveals Video Of How Massive Bunker Buster Bombs That Wrecked Iranian Nuclear Facility Work)\n\n“Now, why, why does that matter to America? Number one, the world’s largest state sponsor of terrorism, like you think it’s bad when we have a domestic terror attack where a couple of people die, and you’re right,” Vance continued. “What happens when the same people who are shooting up a mall or driving airplanes into buildings have a nuclear weapon? That is unacceptable.”\n\nIran threatened to pull out of talks scheduled for Friday in Istanbul, Turkey, insisting that they be moved to Oman, before the United States rejected the last-minute demands.\n\nIn addition to the attack on Iranian nuclear facilities, Trump also ordered a military operation in Venezuela that resulted in the capture of dictator Nicolas Maduro. Trump also ordered strikes on radical Islamic terrorists who were persecuting Christians in Nigeria, deploying troops to assist the Nigerian government.\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Trump promised to not get into so-called endless wars and to focus on the economy, helping propel him to a decisive victory over then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

He endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 elections. \n\n In September, announced he would not perform on the mainland of the United States after President Donald Trump won the 2024 election, because he was worried about his fans getting deported. \n\n‘The NFL is very, you know, Dodge Ram pickup trucks, and dudes… you know, colliding with one another, and it’s like, it’s very male-centric, and it’s also very American, and it’s also it’s a meritocracy, and it’s like, dudes like football,’ Carolla said. ‘And yet, the halftime show rolls around, and we make it all for women, or Puerto Rican women, or the trans community, or something.’\n\n‘A bunch of people would rather hear Ted Nugent,’ he added.\n\nNFL commissioner Roger Goodell responded to Bad Bunny’s political statements at the Grammys by stating that the singer ‘understands’ that the halftime show was ‘used to unite people’ and ‘bring people together.’\n\nBut Carolla said Goodell was likely clueless about the upcoming performance.\n\n‘Here’s my prop bet. Roger Goodell’s never heard of Bad Bunny before,’ he said. ‘His exploratory committee brought it to him four months ago, right? … there’s no way Roger Goodell knew who that was.’\n\nCarolla explained that he found it odd that organizations with conservative fans were almost required to host left-wing performers for their events, but that the left never did the same.\n\n‘They have their events … award shows, and Screen Actors Guild Awards, and whatever little indie thing they’ll do, and, you know, Sundance, or whatever, but they’ll never have Foghat and Ted Nugent play,’ he said. ‘They know who their audience is, you know, and they would never cross them.’\n\nCarolla suggested that the NFL get realistic about taking care of their core fans.\n\n‘Football is sort of Republican, and the fans love Trump … why not just get some bands that they would like, that would not p*** off your crowd?’ he asked.\n\nPresident Trump also voiced his disappointment with the NFL’s choice to have Green Day and Bad Bunny perform at the Super Bowl.\n\n’I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,' Trump told the New York Post.","summary":"Comedian Adam Carolla warned that the NFL risks turning off the league's biggest fans with the decision to host Bad Bunnyas the Super Bowlhalftime show performer.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15527965/Adam-Carolla-Bad-Bunny-NFL-super-bowl.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2026/02/04/18/106105429-0-image-m-27_1770228614382.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 20:01:34","author":"Charlie Spiering,Editor","authors":["Charlie Spiering","Editor"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":399435400,"title":"Washington Post cuts a third of its staff in a blow to a legendary news brand (Business)","text":"Washington Post cuts a third of its staff in a blow to a legendary news brand\n\nWashington Post downsizes\n\nThe Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.\n\nThe Post's executive editor, Matt Murray, called the move painful but necessary to put the outlet on stronger footing and to weather changes in technology and user habits. “We can't be everything to everyone,” Murray said in a note to staff members.\n\nHe outlined the changes in a companywide online meeting, and staff members then began getting emails with one of two subject lines — telling them their role was or was not eliminated.\n\nRumors of layoffs had circulated for weeks, ever since word leaked that sports reporters who had expected to travel to Italy for the Winter Olympics would not be going. But when official word came down, the size and scale of the cuts were shocking, affecting virtually every department in the newsroom.\n\n“It's just devastating news for anyone who cares about journalism in America and, in fact, the world,” said Margaret Sullivan, a Columbia University journalism professor and former media columnist at the Post and The New York Times. “The Washington Post has been so important in so many ways, in news coverage, sports and cultural coverage.”\n\nMartin Baron, the Post's first editor under its current owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, condemned his former boss and called what has happened at the newspaper “a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nAs of midday, the Post did not have any news of the changes on its website.\n\nJournalists pleaded with Bezos for help\n\nBezos, who has been silent in recent weeks amid pleas from Post journalists to step in and prevent the cutbacks, had no immediate comment.\n\nThe newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by Bezos, including pulling back from an endorsement of Kamala Harris, a Democrat, during the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump, a Republican, and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.\n\nA private company, the Post does not reveal how many subscribers it has, but it is believed to be roughly 2 million. The Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.\n\nThe Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.\n\nEliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.\n\nThe Post’s Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.\n\nA half-century ago, the Post's coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime Executive Editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country's best feature writing.\n\nAll Mideast correspondents and editors laid off\n\nWord of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper's Middle East correspondents and editors. “Hard to understand the logic,” she wrote.\n\nLizzie Johnson, who wrote last week about covering a war zone in Ukraine without power, heat or running water, said she had been laid off, too.\n\nAnger and sadness spread across the journalism world.\n\n“The Post has survived for nearly 150 years, evolving from a hometown family newspaper into an indispensable national institution, and a pillar of the democratic system,” Ashley Parker, a former Post journalist, wrote in an essay in The Atlantic. But if the paper’s leadership continues its current path, “it may not survive much longer.”\n\nFearing for the future, Parker was among the staff members who left the newspaper for other jobs in recent months.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, which stopped print editions and went all-digital at the end of last year, announced that it was cutting 50 positions, or roughly 15% of its staff. Half of the eliminated jobs were in the newsroom.\n\nMurray said the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, the Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump's changes to the federal workforce.\n\nThe company's structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to the staff. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn't kept up with consumer habits, he said.\n\n“Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,” he said. “And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.”\n\nWhile there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos — for a “gutless” order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for “moral infirmity” and “sickening” efforts to curry favor with Trump.\n\n“Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron wrote. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.\"\n\nBaron said he was grateful for Bezos' support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president's first term.\n\n“He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post's mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,” Baron wrote. “He often declared that The Post's success would be among the proudest achievements of his life. I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”","summary":"The Washington Post laid off one-third of its staff Wednesday, eliminating its sports section, several foreign bureaus and its books coverage in a widespread purge that represented a brutal blow to journalism and one of its most legendary brands.

These are difficult actions,” Murray said. “We are proud of, and grateful for, the many valued colleagues whose talents and passion have contributed to The Post over many years.”\n\nFormer executive editor of the newspaper, Marty Baron, said in a statement that Wednesday’s layoffs were “among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organizations.”\n\nThe Washington Post Newspaper Guild shared a statement on X saying they “vehemently oppose” additional layoffs, adding that “there is still time to save the Post.” \n\nThe guild is hosting a #SaveThePost rally on Thursday at noon at the paper’s D.C. office.\n\n“If Jeff Bezos is no longer willing to invest in the mission that has defined this paper for generations and serve the millions who depend on Post journalism, then The Post deserves a steward who will,” the guild’s statement concluded.\n\nHeather Kelly, a San Francisco-based technology reporter for the Post who was laid off, told the Daily Beast she was “absolutely devastated” by the news, “not just for myself, but for my amazing, talented colleagues.”\n\n“It’s just a really bad way to see it end,” Kelly, who has two children and was widowed in August, which the company was aware of, said. “I don’t know what’s next, but I’m not optimistic.”","summary":"Michael M.

Gavin Newsom is widely viewed as a strong contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination, particularly by Gavin Newsom. But his record is a real problem, just not in the way pundits think it is. \n\nTake, for example, his determination to thwart the 2026 California Billionaire Tax Act, which would impose a one-time 5 percent levy on residents of the state worth $1 billion or more. This is hardly Bolshevism, as keen mathematicians will note that 5 percent still leaves 95 percent, meaning those affected would wake up the next morning in the same economic bracket that calls to mind a camel and the eye of a needle. Regardless, Newsom remains firmly in the plutocrats’ corner.\n\nThere was also his appearance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, late last month — always a popular destination for those angling for high office — amid President Donald Trump’s lunge toward Greenland. Just as European leaders were discovering that, having tolerated U.S. imperialism in Venezuela, it was now threatening their own backyard, Newsom kindly offered some unsolicited advice, scolding them that “Trump is a T. rex — you mate with him or he devours you, one way or the other, and you need to stand up to it.” (The revelation that T. rexes can be defeated by standing up to them will come as a surprise to anyone who’s seen “Jurassic Park.”) Trump, for his part, merely shrugged in response: “I used to get along so great with Gavin.”\n\nLast week and with much publicity, Newsom launched a review of TikTok’s moderation practices, accusing the platform of suppressing Trump-critical content after a deal was finalized to transfer Chinese ownership of the app to a consortium of pro-Israel, Trump-loving billionaires, including Larry Ellison and Michael Dell. It is unsurprising that social media is an issue of concern for Newsom, as he is apparently the last person on Earth under the impression the Trump administration can be tweeted into submission, a strategy which will surely pay dividends any day now.\n\nFinally, students of shameless self-promotion may already be familiar with “This Is Gavin Newsom,” the podcast launched in early 2025 in which the governor has sought to bridge the political divide by sitting down for chummy dialogue with far-right celebrities like Ben Shapiro and the late Charlie Kirk. What this looks like in practice is Shapiro goading Newsom into denying Israel’s genocidal conduct in Gaza, while Kirk earned Newsom’s fulsome agreement about the nefarious menace of trans women playing sports. \n\nYet there are those in the political media unbothered by all this — if anything, it is the kind of thing they would like to see more of. Instead, their concern comes from a different direction, if not an alternate universe, altogether.\n\nWriting in The Atlantic late last month, Marc Novicoff and Jonathan Chait argued “Gavin Newsom’s Record Is a Problem.” While acknowledging he has “sensed what Democrats want … and is delivering it with a roguish charisma” (your mileage may vary), they nevertheless worry he may be perceived as too progressive. This will, one assumes, be followed by essays on why Chuck Schumer is too courageous and JD Vance is too likable.\n\nNovicoff and Chait posit that Newsom’s tenure as governor has seen California “fall hard for faddish progressive policies on immigration, education, and crime that either didn’t work, violated the intuitions of most Americans, or both.” As proof, they offer the state providing Medicaid to undocumented immigrants and gender-affirming health care for prisoners, both of which they present as catastrophic missteps that will come back to haunt him in 2028.\n\nSuch is the modern centrist credo: to overcome a perception rooted in fantasy, it may be necessary to make the reality of people’s lives worse. In fact, it would seem their preferred litmus test for a candidate is that they not only refuse to recognize the rights and basic humanity of immigrants, LGBTQ+ people, and the incarcerated, but that they also must never offer even the most superficial indication to the contrary.\n\nThis is all par for the course from Chait, who maintains Kamala Harris’s 2024 defeat had little to do with her support for Israel during a genocide, her proud past as California’s “top cop,” or her unwillingness to distance herself from Joe Biden’s legacy. Instead, Chait blames those few instances during her Hindenburg-like 2019 stab at the Democratic nomination where she briefly and unconvincingly pivoted left before returning to the comfort of political moderation.\n\nIn the real world however, the arch-centrist Chait got everything he could hope for in Harris, who promptly blew it; now, with Newsom as the alleged front-runner for 2028, the fact that Chait is already preemptively recycling the same excuses for failure does not inspire confidence.\n\n“Just about everything people don’t like about the Democratic Party has come true in Newsom’s California,” Chait and Novicoff write, inadvertently stumbling onto a point. Many Americans despise the Democrats for their craven coddling of billionaires and corporate interests, their fealty to zombified Third Way snake oil, and their twitchy, terrified suspicion of any mass movement too radical for their own beige, milquetoast taste — and sure enough, in the California governor’s mansion sits a man who personifies all these grim qualities.\n\nIf Newsom — who treats billionaires as a treasured natural resource, who mobilized thousands of National Guard troops to quash Black Lives Matter protests, who made a photo op of breaking down a homeless encampment with his own hands — is not impeccably centrist enough for the likes of Chait, who the hell is? A John Fetterman who’s on the ball and not acting like a Republican? A Kyrsten Sinema whose personal life isn’t straight out of a daytime soap opera? A reanimated WelcomeFest speaker stitched together in Matt Yglesias’s laboratory?\n\nIt does ring true that Newsom will be painted as a deranged radical out of some Californian hippie dystopia, because under Trump, what was once McCarthyism is now standard practice. So why would anyone still believe the forces he represents can be met halfway, given they will inevitably smear as commies anyone to the left of “The Turner Diaries”?\n\nWatching Newsom’s refusal to accept this reality has not been edifying. Following the murder of Renee Good by ICE last month, Newsom’s press office released a post on X which simply read “STATE. SPONSORED. TERRORISM,” a position which held for a little over a week until Ben Shapiro badgered him into walking it back. For all his tough-guy posturing, one wonders how tough a politician can really be if Ben goddamn Shapiro — whose greatest enemies are socialism, wokeness, and things on high shelves — can get you to fold like a cheap lawn chair. But this is Newsom’s style: blustering proclamations that might, to the casual observer, be mistaken for principle or policy, closely followed by the reticence and cowardice that defines mainstream Democratic politics.\n\nIt should go without saying that Newsom’s palling around with right-wing pseudo-intellectuals like Kirk and Shapiro — along with his assurances that he does not favor abolishing the death squads currently occupying Minnesota — do not appear to have won him any converts, respect, or sympathy from the American right. And why should it? In Trump, they have found a president that will indulge their darkest desires, liberate their deepest prejudices and deliver the violence they yearn to see inflicted on all those they judge as deserving — in short, everything they could ever want. Meanwhile, there are still those who believe the key to defeating American fascism is making sure the left gets none of what it wants. Go figure.\n\nUnsurprisingly, there has been little indication the American progressive left perceives Newsom as deserving anything but disdain. Recent weeks have only bolstered the sense that committing to the abolition of ICE is a prerequisite for any remotely moral candidate in 2028. If Newsom fails to become that candidate, it will not be because he appeared too left-wing, but because he lacked the guts or the inclination to be anything except what he manifestly is: a preening political operator, beholden to a status quo that no longer exists.","url":"https://theintercept.com/2026/02/04/gavin-newsom-2028-presidential-campaign/","image":"https://theintercept.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/GettyImages-2259126201-e1770229973153.jpg?fit=4873%2C2436","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 19:28:54","author":"Sean Bell","authors":["Sean Bell"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.015},{"id":399434252,"title":"Jeff Bezos-owned Washington Post slashes hundreds of jobs — including newspaper’s Amazon reporter","text":"Washington Post technology reporter Caroline O’Donovan, who has covered Amazon for almost four years, was among hundreds of staffers laid off Wednesday at the Jeff Bezos-owned newspaper.\n\nO’Donovan confirmed the news, reported by Talking Biz News and others, with a post on X.\n\n“I’m out, along with just a ton of the best in the biz. horrible,” she wrote.\n\nO’Donovan joined the Post in 2022 after seven years as a technology reporter at BuzzFeed. Among her work there covering Amazon, she co-authored a 2019 investigation into the tech giant’s delivery network. TBN reported that the story “revealed how the pressure for productivity contributed to dangerous and even deadly accidents and how Amazon uses third-party contractors to sidestep legal liability.” A follow-up co-published by BuzzFeed and ProPublica was featured on “Frontline” and won a 2019 SABEW award.\n\nBefore joining BuzzFeed, O’Donovan was a staff writer at Harvard’s Nieman Journalism Lab.\n\nIn other posts on X, O’Donovan shared how surprised readers often were that the Post would cover Amazon so closely considering the Bezos tie.\n\nThe New York Times reported Wednesday that cuts at The Washington Post are impacting roughly 30 percent of all its employees, including more than 300 of roughly 800 journalists in the newsroom.\n\nThe paper is eliminating its sports and books sections, stopping its “Post Reports” daily news podcast, and shrinking metro and international coverage. \n\nTech columnist Geoffrey Fowler, who was also laid off, said on LinkedIn that most of the Post’s San Francisco bureau was cut.\n\nExecutive Editor Matt Murray said on a call with newsroom employees that the company had lost too much money for too long, according to the Times.

At the time of the guilty verdict, Routh reportedly tried to stab himself in the neck with a pen.\n\nThe charges against Routh added up to five federal counts in connection with his attempt to shoot then-GOP candidate Trump at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Fla.

But when official word came down, the size and scale of the cuts were shocking, affecting virtually every department in the newsroom.\n\n\"It's just devastating news for anyone who cares about journalism in America and, in fact, the world,\" said Margaret Sullivan, a Columbia University journalism professor and former media columnist at the Post and The New York Times. \"The Washington Post has been so important in so many ways, in news coverage, sports and cultural coverage.\"\n\nMartin Baron, the Post's first editor under its current owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos, condemned his former boss and called what has happened at the newspaper \"a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.\"\n\nAs of midday, the Post did not have any news of the changes on its website.\n\nJournalists pleaded with Bezos for help\n\nBezos, who has been silent in recent weeks amid pleas from Post journalists to step in and prevent the cutbacks, had no immediate comment Wednesday.\n\nThe newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by Bezos, including pulling back from an endorsement of Kamala Harris, a Democrat, during the 2024 presidential election against Donald Trump, a Republican, and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.\n\nA private company, the Post does not reveal how many subscribers it has, but it is believed to be roughly 2 million. The Post would also not say how many people it has on staff, making it impossible to precisely estimate how many people were laid off Wednesday. The Post also did not outline its finances.\n\nThe Post's troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products such as games and its Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade.\n\nEliminating the sports section puts an end to a department that has hosted many well-known bylines through the years, among them John Feinstein, Michael Wilbon, Shirley Povich, Sally Jenkins and Tony Kornheiser. The Times has also largely ended its sports section, but it has replaced the coverage by buying The Athletic and incorporating its work into the Times website.\n\nThe Post's Book World, a destination for book reviews, literary news and author interviews, has been a dedicated section in its Sunday paper.\n\nA half-century ago, the Post's coverage of Watergate, led by intrepid reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, entered the history books. The Style section under longtime editor Ben Bradlee hosted some of the country's best feature writing.\n\nAll Mideast correspondents and editors laid off\n\nWord of specific cuts drifted out during the day, as when Cairo Bureau Chief Claire Parker announced on X that she had been laid off, along with all of the newspaper's Middle East correspondents and editors. \"Hard to understand the logic,\" she wrote.\n\nIn the immediate future, Murray said, the Post would concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness and impact, and resonate with readers, including politics, national affairs and security. Even during its recent troubles, The Post has been notably aggressive in coverage of Trump's changes to the federal workforce.\n\nThe company's structure is rooted in a different era, when the Post was a dominant print product, Murray said in his note to staff members. In areas such as video, the outlet hasn't kept up with consumer habits, he said.\n\n\"Significantly, our daily story output has substantially fallen in the last five years,\" he said. \"And even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience.\"\n\nWhile there are business areas that need to be addressed, Baron pointed a finger of blame at Bezos - for a \"gutless\" order to kill a presidential endorsement and for remaking an editorial page that stands out only for \"moral infirmity\" and \"sickening\" efforts to curry favor with Trump.\n\n\"Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,\" Baron wrote. \"In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.\"\n\nBaron said he was grateful for Bezos' support when he was editor, noting that the Amazon founder came under brutal pressure from Trump during the president's first term.\n\n\"He spoke forcefully and eloquently of a free press and The Post's mission, demonstrating his commitment in concrete terms,\" Baron wrote. \"He often declared that The Post's success would be among the proudest achievements of his life.

Executive editor Matt Murray told staffers that the paper’s books department will be closed, and its Washington-area news department and editing staff will be restructured.\n\nBezos purchased the Washington Post for $250 million in 2013. The Amazon founder, worth an estimated $215 billion, has faced mounting criticism in recent years over his relationship with President Donald Trump.\n\nMore than 200,000 subscribers cancelled their digital subscriptions after Bezos blocked The Post from endorsing Kamala Harris for president in 2024. A directive to alter the tone of The Post’s opinion section in the wake of Trump’s 2024 win also garnered intense scrutiny. So did the $40 million check Bezos cut to fund Melania Trump’s new documentary film.\n\nIn the wake of Wednesday’s layoffs, critics accused Bezos of prioritizing his relationship with Trump over the paper’s editorial independence.\n\nFormer Washington Post editor Marty Baron called this “among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s great news organizations” and slammed Bezos’s “sickening efforts to curry favor with President Trump.”\n\n“He often declared that The Post’s success would be among the proudest achievements of his life,” Baron said in a statement. “I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.”\n\nWashington Post sports columnist Candace Buckner, who was part of the layoffs, called the layoffs an “inconceivable decision.”\n\n“I guess democracy has died, y’all,” Buckner posted on X.\n\nSports media reporter Richard Deitsch was devastated by The Post’s mass firings. \n\n“An absolute disgrace — and it will produce an even larger disconnect between audience retention and the Washington Post brand,“ Deitsch posted on X. ”They gutted this outlet and the only people who will emerge wealthier are the ones who gutted it.\"\n\nEx-Washington Post NFL reporter Steve Wyche was left in disbelief.\n\n“I simply can’t believe what has happened,” Wyche wrote in a post on X. “Working there was such a source of pride. I was pushed by the best editors and colleagues and learned so much about the craft. The collapse of this great beacon of journalism is heart breaking.”\n\nThe Washington Post Guild, the union for staff members, called for a #SaveThePost rally on Thursday at noon. \n\n“If Jeff Bezos is no longer willing to invest in the mission that has defined this paper for generations and serve the millions who depend on Post journalism, then The Post deserves a steward who will,” the Post Guild said in a statement. \n\nBezos has not issued a statement or publicly commented on the layoffs. \n\nWhile staff members and industry figures mourned the layoffs, Bezos’s public attention appeared focused elsewhere.\n\nHis most recent social media post was a reply to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Feb. 2. Bezos thanked Hegseth for touring a rocket facility for his Blue Origin space venture, which last year was awarded $2.4 billion from U.S. Space Force for national security launch contracts. \n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"The billionaire eliminated entire departments including the legendary sports section, prompting former editor Marty Baron to slam his 'sickening' efforts to curry favor with Trump.","url":"https://www.nj.com/politics/2026/02/an-absolute-disgrace-jeff-bezos-blasted-over-trump-ties-after-gutting-the-washington-post.html","image":"https://www.nj.com/resizer/v2/H433MPZAGNCPLA67PRZ27AGTFM.jpeg?auth=1c9212cfc43a25224941af45262ec709ab19b31dbc048f10ab6e97a05953df0e&width=1280&smart=true&quality=90","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 17:54:06","author":"Nick Moyle","authors":["Nick Moyle"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.29},{"id":399413716,"title":"CNN Data Guru Predicts Brutal Home State Humiliation for Trump","text":"CNN data analyst Harry Enten revealed that Donald Trump’s second term is already backfiring in his backyard.\n\nThe data guru revealed on Wednesday’s CNN News Central that Trump 2.0 has already wiped out the gains in the president’s home state of New York—and warned that the party is heading toward an even uglier showing in the November midterms. \n\nHe then revealed that while Kamala Harris won New York by +13 points in 2024—a relatively low margin of victory for the usually deep blue state—New York Democrats in 2026 congressional races are polling at an average of +27 points.\n\n“Look at that wide, huge advantage! That is doubling the margin that Kamala Harris had back in 2024,” Enten exclaimed.\n\nNew York swung to Donald Trump more than any state in the nation in 2024, even as New York Democrats picked up three seats in the 2024 House races. The massive swing had some Republicans dreaming of a purple New York, but Enten predicted that New York will bounce back to solid blue—a warning sign for a state GOP that has already lost a rising star in Elise Stefanik. \n\n“There are a lot of Republican representatives in New York,” he continued. “You know, you talk about Mike Lawler up in the Hudson Valley, right? When you see numbers like this, you have to be really worried if you‘re Mike Lawler, because we‘re talking about a huge Democratic rebound in New York.”\n\nGOP Rep. Mike Lawler, who represents parts of Westchester and Duchess counties, won a tightly contested House race against Mondaire Jones in 2024. Though Democrats have yet to elect Lawler’s 2026 challenger, the prominent election forecaster Cook Political Report moved Lawler’s district, NY-17, from “Lean R” to “Toss Up.” \n\nEnten saw similar leftward shifts in other hugely populous states, which he believes will buoy Democrats’ chances at crushing the GOP in the midterms. \n\nHe revealed that Democrats in California House races are polling at +28, an eight-point improvement from Harris’ 2024 margin. Even more shocking, Democrats in Texas have shaved Trump’s +14 point 2024 margin in the Lone Star State down to +2. \n\nThe grim forecasts come as Republicans are reeling from a shock upset in last week’s Texas state Senate special election, where Democrat Taylor Rehmet crushed Republican Leigh Wambsganss in a district that Trump won by 17 points. \n\nTo Enten, the results of that election aren’t so shocking when considering the massive leftward shift happening in Texas. \n\n“That was a big influence, in terms of what happened in TX-9,” he said. “Yeah, they got a good candidate, but it was also that the environment has shifted so much to the left.”\n\nEnten concluded by noting that the three states’ major leftward shifts are part of why Democrats are favored to dominate in the midterms.","summary":"Screengrab / CNNCNN data analyst Harry Enten revealed that Donald Trump’s second term is already backfiring in his backyard.\n\nThe data guru revealed on Wednesday’s CNN News Central that Trump 2.0 has already wiped out the gains in the president’s home state of New York—and warned that the party is heading toward an even uglier showing in the November midterms. \n\n“Donald Trump made huge gains in 2024 versus 2020 in New York.

The paper had some profitable years under Bezos, sparked by the 2016 election and the first Trump term. But it began losing enormous sums: seventy-seven million dollars in 2023, another hundred million in 2024. The owner who once offered runway was unwilling to tolerate losses of that magnitude. And so, after years of Bezos-fuelled growth, the Post endured two punishing rounds of voluntary buyouts, in 2023 and 2025, that reduced its newsroom from more than a thousand staffers to under eight hundred, and cost the Post some of its best writers and editors. Then, early Wednesday morning, newsroom employees received an e-mail announcing “some significant actions.” They were instructed to stay home and attend a “Zoom webinar at 8:30 a.m.” Everyone knew what was coming—mass layoffs.\nThe scale of the demolition, though, was staggering—reportedly more than three hundred newsroom staffers. The announcement was left to the executive editor, Matt Murray, and human-relations chief Wayne Connell; the newspaper’s publisher, Will Lewis, was nowhere to be seen as the grim news was unveiled. In what Murray termed a “broad strategic reset,” the Post’s storied sports department was shuttered “in its current form”; several reporters will now cover sports as a “cultural and societal phenomenon.” The metro staff, already cut to about forty staffers during the past five years, has been shrunk to about twelve; the foreign desks will be reduced to approximately twelve locations from more than twenty; Peter Finn, the international editor, told me that he asked to be laid off. The books section and the flagship podcast, “Post Reports,” will end. Shortly after the meeting, staffers received individualized e-mails letting them know whether they would stay or go. Murray said the retrenched Post would “concentrate on areas that demonstrate authority, distinctiveness, and impact,” focussing on areas such as politics and national security. This strategy, a kind of Politico-lite, would be more convincing if so many of the most talented players were not already gone.\nGraham, who has previously been resolutely silent about changes at the paper, posted a message on Facebook that pulsed with anguish. “It’s a bad day,” he wrote, adding, “I am sad that so many excellent reporters and editors—and old friends—are losing their jobs. My first concern is for them; I will do anything I can to help.” As for himself, Graham, who once edited the sports section, said, “I will have to learn a new way to read the paper, since I have started with the sports page since the late 1940’s.”\nWhat happened to the Bezos of 2013, a self-proclaimed optimist who seemed to have absorbed the importance of the Post in the nation’s journalistic ecosystem? In 2016, dedicating the paper’s new headquarters, he boasted that it had become “a little more swashbuckling” and had a “little more swagger.” As recently as December, 2024, at the New York Times’ DealBook Summit, Bezos expressed his commitment to nurturing the paper: “The advantage I bring to the Post is when they need financial resources, I’m available. I’m like that. I’m the doting parent in that regard.” Not long ago, he envisioned attracting as many as a hundred million paying subscribers to the Post. With these brutal cuts, he seems content to let the paper limp along, diminished in size and ambition.\n“In the beginning, he was wonderful,” Sally Quinn, the veteran Post contributor and wife of its legendary executive editor, Ben Bradlee, told me of Bezos. “He was smart and funny and kind and interested. He was joyful. He was a person of integrity and conscience. He really meant it when he said this was a sacred trust, to buy the Post. And now I don’t know who this person is.”\nThe author David Maraniss was with the Post for forty-eight years. He resigned as an associate editor in 2024, after Bezos killed the editorial page’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris. “He bought the Post thinking that it would give him some gravitas and grace that he couldn’t get just from billions of dollars, and then the world changed,” Maraniss said of Bezos. “Now I don’t think he gives us—I don’t think he gives a flying fuck.”\nI asked Maraniss what cuts of this magnitude would mean for the institution. “I don’t even want to call it the Washington Post,” he said. “I don’t know what it’ll be without all of that.”\nThe first sign of impending layoffs came in late January, when the sports staff was informed that plans to send writers to Italy to cover the Winter Olympics had been cancelled. (Management later agreed to send a smaller crew.) In the following days, as rumors began to spread of severe cuts, the paper’s reporters began posting messages directed at Bezos on X, with the plaintive hashtag #SaveThePost. “Our reporters on the ground drove exclusive coverage during pivotal moments of recent history,” the foreign staff wrote to Bezos. “We have so much left to do.” The local staff noted that it had already been slashed in half in the past five years. “Watergate,” they wrote, “started as a local story.”\nIt did not help the staff’s morale that Lewis and his team were hobnobbing in Davos, or that Bezos and his wife, Lauren Sánchez, were in Paris for Haute Couture Week. More troubling were reminders that Bezos, who once emblazoned “Democracy Dies in Darkness” on the paper’s masthead, appears to be pursuing a policy of appeasement toward the Trump Administration. During the first Trump term, Bezos stood by the Post even when his stewardship threatened to cost him billions in government contracts. Now Bezos had not said a word about a recent F.B.I. raid on the home of the Post federal-government reporter Hannah Natanson, in which the agency seized her phones, laptops, and other devices. As the staff awaited the axe, the President and the First Lady celebrated the première of “Melania,” a documentary that Amazon had licensed for forty million dollars and was reported to be spending another thirty-five million to promote. The deal was inked after Bezos had dinner with the Trumps shortly before the Inauguration.\nMartin Baron, who oversaw coverage at the paper that garnered eleven Pulitzer Prizes during his eight years as executive editor, said in a statement, “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organizations. The Washington Post’s ambitions will be sharply diminished, its talented and brave staff will be further depleted, and the public will be denied the ground-level, fact-based reporting in our communities and around the world that is needed more than ever.” The news industry is in “a period of head-spinning change,” Baron told me. But the Post’s problems “were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.” He pointed to Bezos’s decision to kill the Harris endorsement—a “gutless order” that cost the paper more than two hundred fifty thousand subscribers. “Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post. In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands,” Baron said. “Bezos’s sickening efforts to curry favor with President Trump have left an especially ugly stain of their own. This is a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\nI had written a column critical of the non-endorsement decision several months earlier. The paper published it without any substantive changes. But, when I wrote a column disagreeing with the no-dissent-allowed dictum, I was told that Lewis had killed it—it apparently didn’t meet the “high bar” for the Post to write about itself—and declined my request to meet. I submitted my letter of resignation. A new editorial-page editor went on to shift both unsigned editorials and signed opinion columns dramatically to the right, to the point that no liberal columnists remain. One recent editorial praised the President’s plan for a new ballroom and excused his unauthorized bulldozing of the East Wing, saying that “the blueprints would have faced death by a thousand papercuts.” Another endorsed the move to rename the Defense Department the Department of War as “a worthy blow against government euphemism.” There are some editorials critical of Trump, but the inclination to fawning praise is unmistakable. Had I not defenestrated myself, I would, no doubt, have been advised to take my buyout and go.\nBut I am not—at least, I have not been—a Bezos-hater. I am grateful for the resources, financial and technological, that he devoted to the paper in his early years as owner. The surprise of Bezos’s tenure at the Post has been his bad business decisions. Fred Ryan, a former chief of staff to Ronald Reagan and founding president of Politico, was hired as the publisher and C.E.O. in 2014 and oversaw a period of spectacular growth. Buoyed by Bezos-funded expansion and the public’s fixation on the new Trump Administration, the number of digital subscribers soared from thirty-five thousand when he arrived to two and a half million when he left, in the summer of 2023. But Ryan failed to develop an adequate plan for how the newspaper would thrive in a post-Trump environment. As traffic and revenue plunged, Ryan found himself increasingly at odds with the newsroom. He held a year-end town-hall meeting in 2022 at which he announced that layoffs were coming, and then, to the consternation of the staff, left without taking questions. As Clare Malone reported for The New Yorker, Woodward beseeched Bezos to intercede. The owner made a rare visit to the paper in January, 2023, for meetings with key staffers, taking notes on a legal pad as they poured out their anxiety.\nRyan left that summer, but Lewis, his eventual replacement, accomplished the feat of making the newsroom nostalgic for Ryan. A decade earlier, Lewis, then a senior executive in Rupert Murdoch’s British-tabloid empire, had played a pivotal role in dealing with the fallout from the phone-hacking scandal at some of Murdoch’s papers. Lewis had said that he was acting to protect “journalistic integrity,” when the Post questioned him about his actions during that time, but in 2024 questions arose, fuelled by a civil lawsuit brought against the papers, about whether Lewis had sought to conceal evidence, including by carrying out a plan to delete millions of e-mails. (Lewis has said the allegations against him were “completely untrue.”) At the Post, Lewis clashed with executive editor Sally Buzbee over coverage of the story, reportedly insisting that it was not newsworthy. Shortly afterward, Lewis announced Buzbee’s departure, and his plan to replace her with Robert Winnett, a former colleague of his from London’s Daily Telegraph and Sunday Times. The Post and the Times both reported on how Lewis and Winnett had used fraudulently obtained material as the basis for articles. “His ambition outran his ethics,” one of Lewis’s former reporters told the Times. Winnett ended up withdrawing from the position, but the episode poisoned relations between Lewis and the newsroom.\nThe staff, meanwhile, became increasingly concerned that Lewis was offering corporate word salad in place of a vision to address the Post’s decline. “Fix it, build it, scale it” was his catchphrase when he arrived, in January, 2024. In June of that year came an amorphous plan for what Lewis called a “third newsroom.” (The second newsroom, we were surprised to learn, was the Opinions section.) First, it was to focus on social media and service journalism. Then it was rechristened WP Ventures and, according to a memo to staff, would “focus entirely on building personality-driven content and franchises around personalities.” By February, 2025, the situation had deteriorated to the point that two former top editors, Leonard Downie and Robert Kaiser, wrote to Bezos about Lewis. “Replacing him is a crucial first step in saving The Washington Post,” they urged in an e-mail. Bezos never responded.\nDownie, who served as executive editor from 1991 to 2008, contrasted the paths of the Times and the Post. During the past decade, the Times transformed itself into a one-stop-shopping environment that lured readers with games such as Spelling Bee, a cooking app, and a shopping guide. By the end of 2025, it was reporting close to thirteen million digital subscribers and an operating profit of more than a hundred and ninety-two million dollars. The Post does not release information about its digital subscribers, but it was reported to have two and a half million digital subscribers at the time of the non-endorsement decision, in 2024.\n“One of the big differences to me was that they hired a publisher”—Ryan—“who didn’t come up with any ideas,” Downie told me. “And then when he left . . . we knew that Bezos was losing money, and we were encouraged by the fact that they were looking for somebody who could improve the business side of the paper and the circulation side of the paper. And then they chose this guy who we hardly ever heard from, who had a checkered past in British journalism.”\nWriting last month on a private Listserv for former Post employees, Paul Farhi, who as the media reporter for the Post covered Bezos’s acquisition of the paper, shared his “utter mystification and bafflement” about Bezos’s tolerance of Lewis. “Even as a hands-off boss,” he wondered, “could Bezos not see what was obvious to even casual observers within a few months of Will’s arrival—that Will was ill-suited to the Post, that he had alienated the newsroom, that he had an ethically suspect past, and—most important—that none of his big ideas was working or even being implemented?” (Farhi, who took a buyout in 2023, gave me permission to quote his message.)\nEven before these new cuts, a parade of key staffers had left the Post. A beloved managing editor, Matea Gold, went to the Times. The national editor, Philip Rucker, decamped to CNN, and the political reporter Josh Dawsey to the Wall Street Journal. The Atlantic hired, among others, three stars of the paper’s White House team: Ashley Parker, Michael Scherer, and Toluse Olorunnipa. These are losses that would take years to rebuild—if the Post were in a rebuilding mode. The Post, Woodward said, “lives and is doing an extraordinary reporting job on the political crisis that is Donald Trump”—including its scoop on the second strike to kill survivors of an attack on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat. But the print edition is a shadow of its former self, with metro, style, and sports melded into an anemic second section; daily print circulation is now below one hundred thousand. More pressingly, it’s unclear whether a newsroom so stripped of resources can sustain the quality of its work.\nThe sports columnist Sally Jenkins, who left the Post in August, 2025, as part of the second wave of buyouts, has been more supportive of management than many other Post veterans. So it was striking that, when we spoke recently, she was both passionate about the work of her newsroom colleagues and unsparing about how the business side had failed them. “When you whack at these sections, you’re whacking at the roots of the tree,” she told me. “We train great journalists in every section of the paper, and we train them to cover every subject on the globe. And when you whack whole sections of people away, you are really, really in danger of killing the whole tree.” When I asked how she felt about the losses, Jenkins said, “My heart is cracked in about five different pieces.”\nJenkins, who was in California covering Super Bowl week for the Atlantic, has spent a career studying what accounts for the difference between winning teams and losing ones. Bezos, she said, had been generous with his money and laudable for never interfering in the work of the newsroom. But, she added, “making money at journalism, you have to break rocks with a shovel. You have to love thinking about journalism to the point that it wakes you up at night with an idea, and then you have to be willing to try it. And I don’t see a sense that he loves the business enough to think about it at night. It’s almost like he’s treated it like Pets.com—an interesting experiment that he’s willing to lose some money on until he’s not. But the difference with this business is it’s not Pets.com. It’s not a business that just disappears into the muck of venture capitalism. It’s a business that is essential to the survival of the Republic, for Christ’s sake. So you don’t fuck around with it like that.”\nAs Post staffers and alumni braced for the cuts, I called Kaiser, the former managing editor, who spent more than half a century at the paper. “Mr. Bezos’s personal system has failed him in a way I fear he doesn’t grasp,” Kaiser, now eighty-two, told me. “He has no sense of the damage that will be done to his reputation in history if he becomes seen as the man who destroyed the institution that Katharine Graham”—the famed publisher who led the paper from the sixties to the nineties—“and Ben Bradlee built.” Kaiser recalled arriving at the paper’s London bureau in 1964. “If I say, ‘I’m Kaiser from the Washington Post’—what’s that? They never heard of it.” A decade later, he was posted in Moscow, as Woodward and Carl Bernstein were breaking the Watergate story. “Explaining was not necessary,” Kaiser said. “The Russians, in fact, had a gloriously exaggerated impression of the Washington Post as the king-maker and the king-destroyer.”\nBezos, Kaiser continued, “knew what the role was, acknowledged the role—those words ‘doting parent’—and then he walked away from it. What the hell?” The damage, he predicted, will reverberate beyond the immediate cuts. “What purpose does any honorable, attractive, competent journalist have for remaining at the Post? None.”\nAt one point, as we talked about the transformation of the Post, Kaiser stopped himself. “I’m going to cry,” he said, and paused. “Oh, God, it’s killing me.”\nThere are models for this approach. In Philadelphia, the late cable-television tycoon H. F. “Gerry” Lenfest purchased the Inquirer, the Daily News, and Philly.com in 2015, and the following year donated the publications to a charitable trust. “What would the city be without the Inquirer and the Daily News?” asked Lenfest, whose contribution to the endeavor has been valued at almost a hundred and thirty million dollars. In Utah, the investor Paul Huntsman bought the Salt Lake Tribune from the hedge fund Alden Global Capital in 2016; three years later, he transformed it into a nonprofit, supported in part by tax-deductible contributions from readers.\nWriting in the Columbia Journalism Review in 2024, Steven Waldman suggested that Bezos follow a similar course. “ ‘Nonprofit’ does not mean ‘losing money,’ ” Waldman wrote. “Nonprofit news organizations can sell ads, offer subscriptions, and take donations. Done well, it is an especially strong business model, because it provides an extra revenue stream (philanthropy) and is deeply embedded in serving the community.” My quibble with Waldman’s pitch is that he asked Bezos to ante up a paltry hundred million. When Bezos purchased the Post, his net worth was about twenty-five billion; it is now an estimated two hundred fifty billion. Why not one per cent of that for the Post, enough to sustain the paper indefinitely? A pipe dream, I know, but this arrangement would make Bezos the savior of the Post, not the man who presided over its demise.\nIn the 1941 movie “Citizen Kane,” Charles Foster Kane, a newspaper publisher who, like Bezos, is one of the richest men in the world, is confronted by his legal guardian, Walter Thatcher, about the folly of funding his paper. “Honestly, my boy, don’t you think it’s rather unwise to continue this philanthropic enterprise, this Inquirer that’s costing you a million dollars a year?” Thatcher demands. “You’re right, Mr. Thatcher. I did lose a million dollars last year,” Kane replies. “I expect to lose a million dollars this year. I expect to lose a million dollars next year. You know, Mr. Thatcher, at the rate of a million dollars a year, I’ll have to close this place in sixty years.” Update Kane’s outlays to assume losses of a hundred million annually, in perpetuity. By that math, Bezos would have more than two millennia before needing to turn out the lights. ♦","summary":"The Amazon founder bought the paper to save it.

The daily “Post Reports” podcast is shutting down, as well as the Metro section, which covers Washington, D.C., Maryland, and Virginia. \n\nMultiple reports suggest as many as 300 employees might lose their jobs in the purge. During the Zoom meeting, The Post’s editors told members of its foreign staff that up to half of the media outlet’s newsroom could face deep cuts.\n\nChief Executive Officer Will Lewis said the layoffs are part of a strategy to make the newspaper profitable by focusing resources on political reporting and a few other areas while scaling back on international and sports coverage. NPR reported that he told others that the newspaper had lost $177 million over the last two years and that public interest in its reporting had declined.\n\n⚠️ The failed news outlet @washingtonpost is expected to lay off 300 of its 1,000 employees, removing the whole Sports department. pic.twitter.com/9gHpvCT6fd— Freedom 🇺🇸 (@MrCaseyLandry) February 4, 2026\n\nWhen Jeff Bezos first acquired The Washington Post in 2013, he expanded operations and invested heavily in the outlet. But recent years have seen drastic financial losses, a severe increase in subscriber cancellations, and a mass exodus of top talent.\n\nThe situation worsened when Bezos announced that The Post would not endorse former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election. This decision alone cost the outlet over 250,000 digital subscribers. This represented about ten percent of the paper’s readership at the time.\n\nBut it wasn’t just the Kamala Harris issue that has contributed to The Post’s problems. Internal data shared with Semafor revealed that the outlet’s daily digital traffic plunged during the Biden years. In January 2021, the Post had about 22.5 million daily active users. By mid-2024, that number had fallen to between 2.5 and 3 million daily users. This is an 87 percent decline over three years. \n\nBut The Washington Post is not alone.\n\nThe newspaper’s decline reflects wider trends occurring in legacy media across the country. A Northwestern University report showed that about 136 newspapers have closed their doors in the past year alone. Since 2005, the U.S. has lost more than a quarter of its newspapers — about 2,500 publications. It is on track to lose more than a third by next year.\n\nU.S. Census Bureau data revealed that newspaper revenue has dropped from $46.2 billion in 2002 to $22.1 billion in 2020 — a 50 percent decline. Much of this is due to advertisers relying more on Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook, and Amazon instead of newspapers. \n\nBut it is not only competition that is killing the Post and other legacy media outlets. It’s also a distinct decline in public trust. With its pivot, the Post alienated many readers that wanted to consume anti-Trump content every day. It also failed to pick up readers on the right to make up for the losses.\n\nThere is also the fact that a growing number of Americans are favoring digital and social media over traditional news outlets. This is especially true of younger generations. The newspaper industry relied heavily on digital subscriptions. But the high prices have turned them into luxury goods that only the wealthy and highly educated can easily afford. Nobody wants to pay exorbitant prices to read information they could easily get on X or other platforms.\n\nIf the Post and other legacy outlets don’t figure out how to adapt to the digital era, they will soon take their place in the ash heap of journalistic history.\n\nEditor's Note: The mainstream media continues to deflect, gaslight, spin, and lie about President Trump, his administration, and conservatives.\n\nHelp us continue to expose their left-wing bias by reading news you can trust.

The troubled Post began implementing large-scale cutbacks on Wednesday, including eliminating its sports department and shrinking the number of journalists it stations overseas. The changes were announced by executive editor Matt Murray in a Zoom meeting with staff. Staff members in the newsroom were told they would be getting emails with one of two subject lines, announcing that the person’s role has or hasn’t been eliminated. A total number of layoffs was not announced in the call, and the Post wouldn't say how big its current staffing is. The newspaper’s books department will be closed, and its Washington-area news department and editing staff will be restructured, Murray told staff members. Its Post Reports podcast will be suspended. Murray acknowledged that the cuts will be a shock to the system but said the goal is to create a Post that can grow and thrive again. The moves were expected for several weeks, since word leaked out that the Post had told its sports staffers who had arranged to cover the Winter Olympics in Italy that they would not be going. After it became public, the Post reversed course and said it would be sending a limited staff. The Post’s troubles stand in contrast to its longtime competitor The New York Times, which has been thriving in recent years, in large part due to investments in ancillary products like its Games site and Wirecutter product recommendations. The Times has doubled its staff over the past decade. In recent weeks, many Post staff members have been appealing directly to the newspaper’s owner, billionaire Jeff Bezos. The newspaper has been bleeding subscribers in part due to decisions made by him — pulling back from an endorsement of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris during the 2024 election against Republican Donald Trump and directing a more conservative turn on liberal opinion pages.

It would appear that the #SaveThePost campaign fell on deaf ears.\n\n“The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company. These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers,” the Washington Post said in a statement.\n\n“The actions we are taking include a broad strategic reset with a significant staff reduction,” Murray declared during a morning call, adding that this was necessary to better position the paper for the years ahead.\n\n“Today, the Washington Post is taking a number of actions across the company to secure our future,” he added.\n\nDuring the call, Murray noted that the Post was getting rid of the publication’s sports team, which had long been an integral part of the paper, though he did say some members of the desk would remain in a new section covering the culture of sports. \n\nMurray also revealed that the paper would be “shrinking” its foreign news bureaus and drastically altering its local coverage. The publication’s flagship podcast, Post Reports, will also be suspended amid this “strategic reset.”\n\n“We can’t be everything to everyone,” Murray said in his note to staff. “But we must be indispensable where we compete. That means continually asking why a story matters, who it serves and how it gives people a clearer understanding of the world and an advantage in navigating it.”\n\nPost employees were told that they would receive emails later in the morning informing them whether they were laid off, the paper’s human resources chief told the staff. He also noted that those impacted by the layoffs would receive benefits through mid-April.\n\nAfter experiencing sustained growth under Bezos after he purchased the outlet over a decade ago, the Amazon founder has seen the Post lose money in recent years, leading the publication to look to turn its fortunes around by shedding staff. Over 200 employees left via buyouts in 2023, followed by another round of buyouts last year amid a conservative shift of the opinion section to appeal to Donald Trump supporters.\n\nThe combination of the opinion page’s new right-leaning stance and Bezos spiking the editorial board’s planned 2024 presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris, however, also led the paper to lose hundreds of thousands of paid subscribers. The Blue Origin founder, who is one of the wealthiest men in the world, has been accused of cozying up to Trump, further eroding trust among left-leaning readers.\n\n“Bezos is not trying to save The Washington Post. He’s trying to survive Donald Trump,” Glenn Kessler, the one-time fact-checker for the Post who took a buyout last year amid the latest staff exodus, wrote on his Substack this week.\n\n“The Post’s challenges, however, were made infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top — from a gutless order to kill a presidential endorsement 11 days before the 2024 election to a remake of the editorial page that now stands out only for its moral infirmity. Loyal readers, livid as they saw owner Jeff Bezos betraying the values he was supposed to uphold, fled The Post,” Baron noted in his statement. “In truth, they were driven away, by the hundreds of thousands.”\n\nMeanwhile, amid rumors in recent weeks that embattled Post CEO and publisher Will Lewis would implement brutal layoffs to push the paper to profitability this year, staffers began publicly appealing to Bezos to step in and halt the cuts.\n\nIn the end, the tech billionaire remained silent and never responded to the letters sent by the foreign news desk, local news team or the paper’s White House reporters. Bezos did, however, make time to personally greet Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth — who booted Post reporters from the Pentagon last year — and show him around his Blue Origin factory this week.\n\n“These layoffs are not inevitable,” the Washington Post Guild said in a statement. “A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach and its future.”\n\nThe paper’s union added that if Bezos was “no longer willing to invest in the mission that has defined this paper for generations and serve the millions who depend on Post journalism, then The Post deserves a steward that will.”\n\nSome employees who found out that they were let go on Wednesday also sounded off publicly about the layoffs — and didn’t mince words.\n\n“I'm among the hundreds of people laid off by The Post. This comes six months after hearing in a national meeting that race coverage drives subscriptions,” race and ethnicity reporter Emmanuel Felton tweeted. “This wasn't a financial decision, it was an ideological one.”\n\nThe Post’s Amazon beat reporter Caroline O’Donovan also confirmed that she was “out, along with just a ton of the best in the biz. Horrible.”\n\n“Laid off from the Washington Post, along with the entire roster of Middle East correspondents and our editors,” Cairo bureau chief Claire Parker added. “Hard to understand the logic. But I am grateful for my incredible colleagues, whose grit and dedication to the reporting and each other I will miss dearly.”\n\nIn her article about the layoffs at the Washington Post, former Post political reporter Ashley Parker wrote forThe Atlantic that “we’re witnessing a murder” and Bezos and Lewis “are embarking on the latest step of their plan to kill everything that makes the paper special.”\n\nIn a statement, the National Press Club said that the “emptying of newsrooms erodes the public’s right to know” and “every lost reporting job is one fewer set of eyes watching institutions that affect people’s daily lives.” Additionally, the organization warned that as “fewer journalists illuminate malfeasance, hold public officials accountable, and report on developments that affect communities across the country, civil society suffers.”","summary":"About 300 journalists in the newsroom are expected to lose their jobs as part of a ‘broad strategic reset’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/washington-post-layoffs-jeff-bezos-b2913912.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/02/27/16/jeffbezonwp.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 16:06:15","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.149},{"id":399362428,"title":"The Washington Post: Democracy Dies in Layoffs [Followup]","text":"Skip to content\n\nTry Ads-Free Fark\n\nIt's Not News, It's Fark\n\nHow To FarkLog In | Sign Up »\n\nForgot password?\n\n Turn on javascript (or enable it for Fark) for a better user experience.\n\nIf you can read this, either the style sheet didn't load or you have an older browser that doesn't support\nstyle sheets.

The committee will focus on training volunteers to attract low-propensity voters with a “listening first approach,” and will host a seven-week training program which includes sessions focused on “active listening” and “having difficult conversations about politics.” (RELATED: CNN’s Harry Enten Says Democrats Will Have Tough Time Taking Back White House)\n\n“Local Listeners is a massive voter contact operation built on a simple but powerful idea: If we want to keep earning back the trust and support of voters, we have to listen to them. This program modernizes the way we are talking to and hearing from the voters that we need to win elections now and for years to come,” DNC Chair Ken Martin said in a Wednesday statement. “The Democratic Party is done with waiting until the last minute to engage voters — these conversations need to happen early and often. And the win-win with this program is that we’re also training thousands of volunteers to be voices for our Party on the frontlines of their communities.”\n\n“While Republicans ignore Americans, preferring to serve billionaires instead of everybody else, Democrats aim to reach over a million voters in the next few months,” Martin continued. “And we’re going to talk about what matters in their lives: affordability, freedom, a shot at the American Dream. That’s how we win in 2026 and beyond.”\n\nThe DNC did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.\n\nOver 2,000 volunteers have signed up for the DNC’s new program thus far, with 93% volunteering for the first time since 2024, according to the news release.\n\n“We didn’t lose to [President] Donald Trump. We lost to the couch,” DNC Deputy Executive Director Libby Schneider told Politico in an interview published Wednesday. “We saw our voters, many of our important voters, stay home.”\n\n“Obviously, that is a trend that cannot continue,” Schneider added.\n\nA key element of Trump’s successful political strategy in 2024 was connecting with voters who were not typically seen as supporting Republicans but had been identified by his campaign as being persuadable to vote for the GOP, Politico reported.\n\nSchneider also told Politico that the DNC’s new outreach program is part of the period of “self-reflection” Democratic Party organizers had following Trump’s 2024 election win.\n\n“The work started immediately after we lost, and it was sort of a self-reflection of … what can we do differently and what is within our control?” Schneider told the outlet. “This is one of those things that it’s a no-brainer that it should live with the DNC, and that we should have been doing it for a lot longer.”\n\nSeveral analysts previously told the DCNF in May 2025 that encouraging low-propensity Trump voters in the 2026 midterms may be key for Republicans to maintain control of both chambers of Congress.\n\nJenifer Fernandez Ancona, co-founder of liberal donor network Way To Win, told Politico that she thinks potential former Vice President Kamala Harris voters who stayed home in 2024 simply “didn’t like what they heard.”\n\n“They weren’t uninformed, right?” Ancona told the outlet. “They just didn’t like what they heard. So that’s why I feel like it’s so important for any engagement plan to recognize how kind of burned and cynical these voters are.”\n\nThe DNC said in a Wednesday press release that volunteers for the new initiative will also “be trained on how to capture qualitative information from their conversations with voters, which will allow the DNC to identify key themes and share those insights with the [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee] to inform their messaging on the ground in target congressional districts,” The Hill reported.\n\nIn August 2025, center-left think tank Third Way published a memo highlighting 45 words and phrases they want Democrats to refrain from using because “no ordinary person would ever dream of” saying them. Some of the phrases mentioned in Third Way’s memo included “birthing person,” “cisgender,” “deadnaming,” “heteronormative” and “patriarchy.”\n\nAdditionally, Martin told Politico in an October 2025 interview that there is “not a day that I don’t go home wanting to pull my hair out” in his gig as the DNC’s chairman.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Or has Jeff Bezos decided to right-size it to its income after several years of significant losses?\n\nAnd is there any difference between the two?\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray held a staff meeting today, in which he apparently not just lowered the boom but lowered several booms. According to leaks from the meeting, Murray – brought in less than two years ago from the Wall Street Journal – informed staff that the paper would shed several features, including sports coverage, and pull back on its foreign reporting. \n\nThis news understandably did not land well with the Post's employees:\n\nWaPo's Matt Murray told staff the paper is shuttering its sports section, moving remaining staff to features, shrinking foreign coverage, restructuring metro, closing books coverage, suspending Post Reports podcast“Whole company now waiting for a live or die email” one staffer…— Natalie Korach (@NatalieKorach) February 4, 2026\n\n\"Live or die\"? The Wrap followed up by reporting on Murray's \"strategic reset,\" and explaining what \"live or die\" means:\n\nExecutive editor Matt Murray framed the moves to staff in a Wednesday morning meeting as a \"strategic reset,\" the sources said. He did not announce how many jobs will be affected.\"These moves are painful,\" Murray said. \"This is a tough day.\"HR chief Wayne Connell told staff they'll receive an email saying whether or not they're roles have been eliminated.\n\nThe paper has already undergone more than one round of layoffs and has shed a few features along the way, but this looks much more like a complete reorganization. If the scope of the changes matches the leaks, the Post will come out the other side much more of a Beltway paper than a major national daily. In fact, it might leave that market entirely to the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe Wrap's source is unhappy with the paper's management, as one can expect, but also appears to have a short memory:\n\nMurray took no questions during the short meeting, which rankled staff.\"This was handled with cowardice,\" one longtime staff told TheWrap. \"Washington Post executives took no ownership this morning for the questionable strategic and business decisions they have made that put the Post behind.\"\n\nThat's not actually true. Even CNN felt obliged to remind its readers that the Post's publisher Will Lewis warned Post staff about its unsustainable path and the need to broaden its reach and appeal, and so did owner Jeff Bezos. Well, sorta:\n\nThe Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, has spoken privately about finding a path to profitability for the Post by focusing the paper’s investment on politics and a few other key areas, while cutting back in areas like sports and foreign affairs. ...A year ago, Bezos outlined a new vision for the Post’s once-esteemed opinion section, promoting libertarian ideals, including free markets and personal liberties. That decision led opinion editor David Shipley to exit the company.Bezos’ change came months after he canceled a planned editorial page endorsement of Kamala Harris in late 2024. That decision led to mass cancellations from subscribers, hurting the Post’s bottom line.\n\nAhem. I'll pass on the editorializing over \"once-esteemed opinion section,\" which hasn't been true in the years since it mainly turned into the Several Flavors of Orange Man Bad section. CNN has the timeline wrong as well. Both Lewis and Murray warned the staff in June 2024, not February 2025, that the Washington Post was on a collision course with collapse. Lewis and Murray informed them at that time that the paper had lost half its audience in the previous three years and had lost $77 million in 2023 alone. \n\nWhat was the response from the staff at that point? Oh, yeah:\n\nWhen Washington Post publisher Will Lewis and new interim executive editor Matt Murray met with staff Monday, the newsroom was still coming to terms with the abrupt exit of Sally Buzbee, who had led the paper since May 2021.“Everyone was pretty shocked with your email last night,” one reporter said at the meeting, according to a source present. The reporter suggested that “the most cynical interpretation sort of feels like you chose two of your buddies to come in and help run the Post, and we now have four white men running three newsrooms,” and expressed surprise at this development given Lewis’s prior commitments to diversity.\n\nLewis warned in response that he wasn't going to stick with the plan that involved losing $77 million a year to float a vanity project for progressive activists:\n\nAt one point Lewis was asked whether he was intentionally bringing in people who come from a different culture than the Post. “We are losing large amounts of money. Your audience has halved in recent years. People are not reading your stuff. I can’t sugarcoat it anymore,” Lewis said. “So I’ve had to take decisive, urgent action to set us on a different path, sourcing talent that I have worked with that are the best of the best.”\n\nEver since, the staff has not just resisted Lewis' efforts, but they have repeatedly demanded that Bezos intervene on their behalf to reverse Lewis' policies. Meanwhile, the performance of the Post has not improved, even though Lewis did make an effort to rebalance the opinion section, which has not done much to correct the newspaper's course. That turned out to be a very small plug for a very large hole in the Post's boat.\n\nBezos did not accumulate his fortune by dumping his wealth into sinkholes for an extended period of time. He and Lewis have tried to bring the Post back to profitability, or at least something close to a break-even status, while its staff balked over its DEI demands and progressive agendas. Downsizing is the inevitable result, and anyone surprised at the outcome simply refused to pay attention. The only question now is whether downsizing will be enough, and thus far, the signs are not encouraging. \n\nMy friend John Ondrasik sums up the problem:\n\nI do not delight in the dispatch of dutiful defenders of Democracy at the @washingtonpost but its downfall was destined the day they deemed this daft dictum didactic. 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/dU4lSC8gXu— John Ondrasik (@johnondrasik) February 4, 2026\n\nEditor’s Note: Every single day, here at Hot Air, we will stand up and FIGHT, FIGHT, FIGHT against the radical left and deliver the conservative reporting our readers deserve. \n\nHelp us continue to expose the idiocy of progressive elites.

Approximately one-third of employees were affected.\n\nStaffers at the Post have been on edge for weeks about the rumored cuts, which the publication would not confirm or deny. “It’s an absolute bloodbath,” said one employee, not authorized to speak publicly.\n\nDuring a morning meeting announcing the changes, the editor in chief, Matt Murray, told employees that the Post was undergoing a “strategic reset” to better position the publication for the future, according to several employees who were on the call.\n\nMurray acknowledged that the Post had struggled to reach “customers” and talked about the need to compete in a crowded media marketplace. “Today, the Washington Post is taking a number of actions across the company to secure our future,” he said, according to an audio recording of the meeting.\n\nMurray told employees that the Post was ending the current iteration of its popular sports desk, though some employees would remain on a new team. The Post is also restructuring its local coverage, reducing its international reporting operation, cutting its books desk and suspending its flagship daily news podcast Post Reports.\n\nMurray said that while the Post’s international coverage team will be scaled back, approximately 12 bureaus will remain “with a focus on national security issues”.\n\n“We all recognize the actions we are taking today will be painful – most of all, of course, for those of you who are directly affected, but for everybody,” Murray told staffers on the call. “I know that the reset is going to feel like a shock to the system and raise some questions for everybody.”\n\nMartin Baron, the Post’s executive editor until 2021, said: “This ranks among the darkest days in the history of one of the world’s greatest news organizations.”\n\nSeeking to lay out the business case for the layoffs, Murray said the move was “about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people’s lives in what is becoming a more crowded and competitive and complicated media landscape”.\n\n“I know that these last couple of weeks have been an unusually tense and distracting time for all of us, and I know it will be a difficult day,” he added. “I appreciate the excellence of your work during this time.”\n\nMurray said the Post’s largest team would be focused on covering politics and government, and the paper would also prioritize coverage of nationals news and features topics such as science, health, medicine, technology, climate and business.\n\nPost employees who have been laid off will continue to be on staff through 10 April, though they will not be required to work. They will receive six months of continued health insurance coverage.\n\nThe affected employees include Caroline O’Donovan, who primarily covers Amazon, the company founded by the Post owner, Jeff Bezos. Other staffers, including the sports journalist Neil Greenberg, have also announced that they were affected.\n\nOne editor who was laid off on Wednesday laid much of the blame at the feet of the Post’s publisher, Will Lewis, who did not speak on the company’s morning conference call.\n\n“Will Lewis’s legacy (already pretty bleak to begin with) will be having enabled Bezos to tank an American institution,” the staffer said, requesting anonymity to speak candidly. “And he wasn’t even brave enough to face his staffers more than once in his tenure at the Post. Embarrassing to say the least.”\n\nAfter years of growth under owner Bezos, the Post has been shedding staff over the last few years. About 240 staffers left via buyouts offered at the end of 2023, and another chunk of staffers took buyouts last year, which were offered to any employee with more than 10 years of experience.\n\nLayoffs, particularly of journalists in the newsroom, have been less common. In fall 2024, the Post laid off 54 employees from the division responsible for its proprietary publishing software, and in January 2025, the Post laid off about 4% of staffers who worked in advertising, marketing and print operations.\n\nOver the past week, Post employees had been urging Bezos to stop – or at least soften – the planned cuts, signing letters and sending personalized messages on social media that conveyed the importance of the journalism the Post produces.\n\nBut Bezos has remained silent, and did not respond to a series of letters sent by staffers representing the newspaper’s foreign, local and White House reporting teams.\n\nOn Monday, though, he was there in person to warmly greet Pete Hegseth, the US defense secretary, on a tour of another one of the companies he owns, his Blue Origin spaceflight startup in Florida.\n\nBaron, the former executive editor, warned: “The Washington Post’s ambitions will be sharply diminished, its talented and brave staff will be further depleted, and the public will be denied the ground-level, fact-based reporting in our communities and around the world that is needed more than ever.”\n\nBaron called out Bezos for an ill-timed decision to pre-empt the Post’s planned endorsement of Kamala Harris for president in fall 2024, as well as a decision to narrowly focus its opinion page to prioritize writing “in support and defense of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets”, decisions that led to the resignation of a top editor and quickly cost the Post hundreds of thousands of subscribers.\n\n“Bezos’s sickening efforts to curry favor with President Trump have left an especially ugly stain of their own,” Baron said. “This is a case study in near-instant, self-inflicted brand destruction.”\n\nThe union representing most Post employees said the cuts made on Wednesday were not “inevitable”.\n\n“A newsroom cannot be hollowed out without consequences for its credibility, its reach and its future,” the union said. “Continuing to eliminate workers only stands to weaken the newspaper, drive away readers and undercut The Post’s mission: to hold power to account without fear or favor and provide critical information for communities across the region, country and world.”\n\nThe union suggested that Bezos might not be the right owner for the Post. “If Jeff Bezos is no longer willing to invest in the mission that has defined this paper for generations and serve the millions who depend on Post journalism, then the Post deserves a steward who that will.”\n\nThe union has organized a protest of the cuts to be held in front of the Post’s Washington DC headquarters on Thursday.","summary":"Former Post executive editor blasts owner Jeff Bezos’s ‘sickening efforts to curry favor’ with Trump\n\nThe Washington Post laid off hundreds of employees  on Wednesday, which its former executive editor said “ranks among the darkest days” in the newspaper’s history.

Well, there is a coterie of leftists that leans into the opposite position of whatever Donald Trump says. This has led to some interesting contradictions over the years, the latest of which concerns Haiti.\n\nBack in 2018, during his first term, President Trump called Haiti a “s**thole country.” So, what did the leftist bunch of contrarian hypocrites do? They circled the virtue-signaling wagons. For example, comedian Conan O'Brien posted a picture of himself on social media, basking on the Haitian coast and sipping a coconut. Additionally, he, political pundit Bill Maher, and actress Susan Sarandon wore pithy little shirts that said, “Haiti is great already.”\n\n“Haiti is great already” is a potent moment.It encapsulates one of the most widespread and malicious confusions in the world today: that the West is bad and the rest of the world is morally superior. https://t.co/aCvUGh4wt3 pic.twitter.com/6aprwWenbk— Jonatan Pallesen (@jonatanpallesen) April 23, 2025\n\n“Haiti has never been great, though,” Hot Air’s David Strom points out. “It has been one of the world’s great s*!tholes for centuries, dating back to when it was a slave colony run by the French, producing riches beyond measure both for the Ancién Regime and then for the Republic, through the slave revolt, race wars, and rule by the warlord merry-go-round.”\n\nHaiti is run by gangs and riddled with misery. Who can forget the horrible murder of three missionaries — Davy Lloyd, Natalie Lloyd, and Jude Montis — whose lives were claimed by gangs in the summer of 2024? Who can forget the assassination of the Haitian president in 2021? His death shook the country down to its foundation.\n\nThe cultural elite were dead wrong to call Haiti “great” in 2018, especially when considering that the only part they probably saw was from the interior of a gated resort with heavy security.\n\nFast-forward to 2026, and the Trump administration is ending Haitian Temporary Protected Status (TPS) at the direction of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. This program has been bringing Haitians to the U.S. since a major hurricane destroyed the island 15 years ago.\n\nThe Democrat outcry has been vehement.\n\nFlorida Democrat Congresswoman Frederica Wilson declared that sending Haitian refugees back to Haiti is a death sentence. “In Haiti, there is open warfare and rape,” she said. “There’s ravaging violence against women and children. There are no school days, no work schedule. You do what the gangs want you to do, and they are terrorized.”\n\nRep. Wilson: “To send Haitians to Haiti is a death sentence… full of warfare, r*pe, and vioIence” pic.twitter.com/UrP8SkkNrS— End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) February 1, 2026\n\nNew York Democrat Congresswoman Laura Gillen echoed the sentiment that sending Haitians back home is “basically a death sentence.”\n\nRep. Laura Gillen (D): “Sending Haitians to Haiti is a death sentence” pic.twitter.com/7pLt822dAm— End Wokeness (@EndWokeness) January 31, 2026\n\nOn Monday, U.S. District Court Judge Ana Reyes put an indefinite pause on ending Haitian TPS. Reyes stated that Secretary Noem’s decision to end it violated the Administrative Procedure Act and that Noem showed “racial animus.”\n\nHer claim of “racial animus” is silly, ugly, and typical of Democrat slurs.\n\nJudge Reyes was appointed by Joe Biden and is a loyal Democrat donor. She donated to the Biden, Hillary Clinton, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Kamala Harris campaigns. In other words, she is a partisan hack.\n\nIt’s also no coincidence that Reyes should be the one to intervene. According to the New York Post, “Biden appointed Reyes to the federal bench in February 2023 — one month after his administration allowed up to 30,000 Haitians to enter the US every month under a humanitarian parole program.”\n\nThere was such an outrageous influx of Haitians that during the 2024 election, Haitian refugees inundated Springfield, Ohio, where their lack of assimilation caused serious problems for the locals. That’s the origin of the unproven claims that Haitians were eating pets.\n\nIn response to Reyes upholding TPS, Republican Ohio Senator Bernie Moreno noted, “When a Democrat president can create a TEMPORARY program and an unelected Democrat judge can unilaterally block a duly-elected Republican president from ever undoing it, we do not live in a democracy. This outrageous decision cannot stand.”\n\nAs far as the Democrats’ flip-flopping is concerned, these elitist cowards can say whatever they like from atop their ivory towers. They have very plush homes and security. Ergo, their tantrums about Trump and deportation are peak luxury beliefs.\n\nIt’s true that Haitians do not have a great country to return to. But then why does it follow that the U.S. has to be the one to harbor them? What good have Haitians brought to the U.S.?\n\nAs Strom goes on to write, “I genuinely have no clue how we should treat Haitian refugees. I sympathize with their plight and am justifiably angry that they do little more than present problems here in America. I am angriest of all at the people who have done nothing but gaslight us, telling us whatever story is convenient for their purposes whenever it suits them.”\n\nCouldn’t have said it better myself.\n\nLeftists demand stories like shutting down TPS for Haitians to fuel their outrage machine — and to satisfy their TDS.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/articles/124810-democrats-flip-flop-on-haiti-2026-02-04","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01KGJT1Y2ZW37AF3E442QB4KPG.jpeg?w=1200&h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-02-04 15:36:22","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":399364570,"title":"Washington Post to lay off one-third of its staff, including entire sports department","text":"By DAVID BAUDER | Associated Press\n\nThe Washington Post is laying off one-third of its staff in the newsroom and other departments, a brutal blow at one of journalism’s most legendary brands.\n\nThe troubled Post began implementing large-scale cutbacks on Wednesday, including eliminating its sports department and shrinking the number of journalists it stations overseas.
