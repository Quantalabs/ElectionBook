Email tips@dailymail.com\nBy JESSICA JANES FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:19:35 GMT, 29 January 2025 |Updated:19:41 GMT, 29 January 2025 \n\nLily James sent temperatures soaring on Wednesday as she shared a series of vacation snaps from her sun-soaked getaway. \nThe actress, 35, looked incredible as she slipped into a black triangle bikini in sizzling snaps posted on Instagram. \nEscaping the hustle and bustle of the UK, Lily went makeup-free for her beach outing, letting her tousled waves flow freely as she swung on a beachside swing. \nIn another breathtaking shot, she flaunted wet hair while unwinding in a private hut, later diving into a book as the sun set. \nLily also treated her followers to a gorgeous silhouette shot of the sunset, plus a natural selfie showcasing her effortless beauty and embracing her natural hair. \nEarlier this month, Lily gave her followers an insightful look into her recent tropical getaway and also shared a very cheeky inspirational message. \n\nLily James, 35, sent temperatures soaring on Wednesday as she shared a series of vacation snaps from her sun-soaked getaway\n\nIn one breathtaking shot, the actress showed off her natural beauty as she went makeup-free while unwinding in a private hut\nIn one of the snaps, Lily was laid back as she sat down for dinner during the winter escape, covering her mouth with her phone which had a cheeky inspirational message.\nLily's phone case sported the phrase, 'Slow the f*** down'. \nLast month, the English actress was seen leaving London celebrity hangout Chiltern Firehouse with American billionaire Brian Chesky – who is chief executive of Airbnb.\nDespite the late hour, Lily looked elegant in a black faux fur coat, leather trousers and slingback stiletto heels.\nBut US entrepreneur Chesky – said to be worth £6.2billion - seemed keen not to be spotted with the Downton Abbey star, leaving the nightspot via a back entrance and attempting to hide his face as they climbed into a waiting Range Rover together.\nIt is not clear how the pair know each other.\nChesky, 43, who co-founded the short-term-rental app in 2007, is the 355th richest person in the world, according to Forbes, and was in a long-term relationship with artist Elissa Patel until they split in 2022.\nHe has more recently been linked with Sports Illustrated model Brooks Nader.\n\nLily also treated her followers to a gorgeous silhouette shot of the sunset\n\nEscaping the hustle and bustle of the UK, Lily then dived into a book as the sun set \n\nShe also shared a natural selfie that highlighted her effortless beauty and embraced her natural hair \nLily has previously dated Queens Of The Stone Age bassist Michael Shuma, but it is unclear if they are still together.\nLily was also linked to married actor Dominic West while they filmed The Pursuit of Love together. And she had a five-year relationship with former Doctor Who Matt Smith.\nThe actress will be back on the big screen next year in a reboot of the 1993 thriller Cliffhanger.\nShe is also set to appear in Swiped, a film based on the life of Whitney Wolfe Herd, who founded the online dating platform Bumble, so maybe Chesky can offer her some insight into the life of a tech tycoon.\n\nEarlier this month, Lily gave her followers an insightful look into her recent tropical getaway and also shared a very cheeky inspirational message \n\nLast month, the English actress was seen leaving London celebrity hangout Chiltern Firehouse with American billionaire Brian Chesky (pictured last month) - who is chief executive of Airbnb\n\nThe actress will be back on the big screen next year in a reboot of 1993 thriller Cliffhanger (pictured)\n\n Make-up free Lily James poses in a tiny black bikini as she continues to enjoy a sun-soaked holiday \nIn the first shots from the Austrian production, the British actress is shown hanging from a rock face in a shot that mimics one from the original film.\nThe father-daughter duo, Naomi (Lily) and Ray (Pierce Brosnan) 'run a mountain chalet in the Dolomites. During a weekend trip with a billionaire's son, they are targeted by a gang of kidnappers,' an official synopsis reads.\n'Ray's older daughter Naomi, still haunted by a past climbing accident, witnesses the attack and escapes.'\nRay is kidnapped while climbing with the son of a billionaire and Naomi must 'save her family' while fighting 'for survival in the Italian Dolomites,' the synopsis concludes.\nThe film is shot in Austria, Italy and Germany and also stars Nell Tiger Free, Franz Rogowski, Shubham Saraf, Assaad Bouab, Suzy Bemba and Bruno Gouery.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nLily James sends temperatures soaring in a skimpy black bikini during sun-soaked holiday\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVETaylor Swift taking a 'step back' from Blake Lively as dramatic legal battle with Justin Baldoni threatens their decade-long friendship\n\nCriminal Love Island star Jack Fincham walks free from court with his Towie girlfriend after being jailed for six weeks for dog attack\n\nBREAKING NEWSRihanna makes shock court appearance to support boyfriend A$AP Rocky who faces 24 years prison\n\nVanessa Feltz's ex Ben Ofoedu breaks his silence on their calamitous split and reveals how he REALLY feels about her: EDEN CONFIDENTIAL\n\n'Nervous' Stacey Solomon reveals she's finally able to share huge news with husband Joe Swash\n\nSomething for everyone!

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy DEIRDRE DURKAN-SIMONDS and JAMES VITUSCKA FOR DAILYMAIL.COM \n Published:18:00 GMT, 29 January 2025 |Updated:19:13 GMT, 29 January 2025 \n\nBlake Lively's brother-in-law made a shock apology to Justin Baldoni amid their explosive legal feud, after she sued her It Ends with Us costar for sexual harassment.\nOn Tuesday, Bart Johnson, who is married to Lively's sister Robyn Lively, took to X (previously known as Twitter) to express remorse over his since-deleted posts on social media, in which he called Baldoni a 'fraud' and criticized his appearance. \n'Anytime I've said anything unkind about someone I've regretted it. Fortunately that's almost never and definitely not when I’m at my best,' he stated. \n'Regardless if it's true or not, if it’s my opinion, even if I'm trying to speak truth or stand up for someone, it’s never good.'\nJohnson continued: 'Even in times where it might 'feel' justified and doing the right thing, it makes no difference. There’s a better way. It’s below the standard I have for myself and I regret it.' \nThe High School Musical star was referring to his post, captured by USA Today, that accuses Baldoni of putting 'on the costume of a hero, man bun and all' and using 'trendy catchphrases & buzz words for his podcasts.'\n'None of it's genuine. It's all theater. And everyone fell for it. For years,' Johnson said of Baldoni's reputation of being a feminist and proud ally to women.\n\nBlake Lively's brother-in-law, Bart Johnson, made a shock apology to Justin Baldoni amid their explosive legal feud; (L-R) Johnson, Blake, and Robyn Lively\nIn his tweet, Johnson also told fans that he 'sincerely' apologized to anyone that he 'hurt or let down by saying something that sounds mean.'\n'I’ll do better. If you follow me you know you’ll be hard pressed to find more than 1 time I’ve criticized anyone on social. It’s not my jam. . . We all have flaws and I’m definitely a work in progress and doing my best to grow and be better,' he promised. \n\nEXCLUSIVE Texts reveal Blake Lively's VERY flirty exchanges with Justin Baldoni before they became enemies \nAfter one X user called his tweet 'strange' and asked if he was trying to avoid litigation by not apoogizing directly to Baldoni, Johnson replied: 'Now I’m gonna get sued? [laughing emoji] for what? I find those type of podcasts phony. I do. That’s not a crime. But I do feel bad rippin on them. That’s literally all I said.' \n'Just like you and all the toxic and hateful comments I get from his fans wishing me and my children harm and calling me all the vile names you can imagine, it’s not a crime. People are free to do so and I’m not mad,' he said. 'That fine. I can take the beatings. You think I deserve it? Okay that’s fine too. Movin on. Can’t let it get me down. Keep bein me. 2025 gonna be great!! Let’s goooooo…' \nJohnson has been a vocal supporter of Blake amid her legal battle and public row with Baldoni, who she claims launched a smear campaign against her. \nIn her complaint and legal filing, she stated that Baldoni hired crisis management expert Melissa Nathan, who previously worked for Johnny Depp amid his long-running legal battle with ex-wife Amber Heard, over the summer.\nLast month, Johnson wrote on social media that 'the public got played' by Baldoni and that his 'PR team was stellar.'\n'Gross and disgusting but highly effective,' he said of the alleged actions of Baldoni's team.\n\nOn Tuesday, Bart Johnson, who is married to Lively's sister Robyn Lively, took to X (previously known as Twitter ) to express remorse over his since-deleted posts on social media, in which he called Baldoni (seen last year) a 'fraud' and criticized his appearance\n\n'Anytime I’ve said anything unkind about someone I’ve regretted it. Fortunately that’s almost never and definitely not when I’m at my best,' he tweeted. 'Regardless if it’s true or not, if it’s my opinion, even if I’m trying to speak truth or stand up for someone, it’s never good'\nAt the time, he pointed out that 'Blake's 'complaints were filed during the filming ... on record ... long before the public conflict.' \n'The cast unfollowed him for a reason. Read this article before spiting ignorance. Read the article, their text message exchanges and his PR campaign strategy to bury her by any means necessary,' Johnson wrote. \nJohnson conceded that while 'no one is with out faults' and 'yes of COURSE mistakes were made,' he felt Blake was in the right in regard to the professional conflict. \nJohnson described Blake, who's wed to Ryan Reynolds, 48, as 'a stay at home mom raising 4 kids, married to the busiest man in Hollywood and at the same time being a girl boss running multiple companies while writing, producing, running non profits and working 16+ hour days from home so [she] can be with [her] kids.'\nJohnson in a subsequent comment said Blake was 'attacked by a VERY expensive PR smear campaign because [she] filed a sexual harassment claim for the very film [she] have to go out and promote with just the right tone or [she'd] get cooked' by Baldoni's team.\n\nLast month, Johnson wrote on social media that 'the public got played' by Baldoni and that his 'PR team was stellar' (Blake seen in August 2024)\n\nJohnson has been married to Blake's sister since 1999\nHe said he viewed Blake as 'a \"girl boss\"' who has proven 'every bit as capable and qualified if not more so' than men in her industry, adding, 'She’s my hero as is any woman charging it like this.' \nIn reference to a 2016 Blake interview that has circulated amid her clash with Baldoni, Johnson said, 'I mean, she’s been rude in these interviews that magically played on repeat. I saw it. None of us have ever been wrong or mean.\n'Never. We should discount decades of good for those few bad moments. Glad the microscope isn’t on me every day of my life.'\nHe said of his sister-in-law: 'Looks like she’s doing a hell of a job to me and trying to do good things for the right reasons. But yeah let’s post from our couch how much we hate her for making mistakes. That makes sense.'\nBart first spoke out after his spouse Robyn, 52, posted a message on her Instagram story as she weighed in on the explosive court battle which has stunned Hollywood. \n\nBart first spoke out after his spouse Robyn, 52, posted a message on her Instagram story as she weighed in on the explosive court battle which has stunned Hollywood; seen in 2022\nGossip Girl star Lively claims Baldoni hired a crisis PR team to engage in a 'multi-tiered' plan to 'destroy' her reputation after she and her husband Ryan Reynolds complained of 'repeated sexual harassment and other disturbing behavior' on set. \nThe film was mired in controversy even before the lawsuit after fans noticed tensions between Lively and Baldoni when they were promoting the movie before its release.\nLively has accused Baldoni, who also directed the film, of making sexual comments about the cast and crew, showing her explicit videos and images of women and discussing his previous alleged porn addiction.\nStanding in solidarity with her younger sister, Robyn shared screenshots from a New York Times article that laid bare the astonishing details of the lawsuit.\n\nLively has accused Baldoni, who also directed the film, of making sexual comments about the cast and crew, showing her explicit videos and images of women and discussing his previous alleged porn addiction \n'FINALLY justice for my sister @BlakeLively,' she wrote, highlighting specific sentences from the article such as 'Ms Lively had expressed concerns about Mr Baldoni from the beginning'.\nShe also encouraged her followers to click on and read the article and wrote 'Blake Lively' with a heart drawn around the name.\nBaldoni hit back at the New York Times by suing the publication for defamation before launching the $400million lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds earlier this month, in which he accused the Hollywood pair of conspiring to trash his reputation with the allegations.\nHe also accused Lively of hijacking the filming of It Ends With Us, which he directed, and claimed she forced him and his family to wait in a basement holding area at the premiere so she did not have to see him.\n\nBaldoni hit back at the New York Times by suing the publication for defamation before launching the $400million lawsuit against Lively and Reynolds earlier this month, in which he accused the Hollywood pair of conspiring to trash his reputation with the allegations (seen in July 2024)\nWhile many have questioned why Baldoni is going after the specific sum, a source exclusively told DailyMail.com that he deduced the figure from Lively and Reynolds' reported net worth.\nThey said Baldoni has already lost out on thousands since being dropped by his agent, and that if the couple were successful in their lawsuit, he could be left penniless.\n'Justin Baldoni chose $400 million because of the simple reason that Blake and Ryan's combined net worth is believed to be around that figure,' the source said.\n'If they were successful in their pursuits, Justin would have lost everything he has and everything he has ever worked for.\n'He has already lost jobs including the podcast and he was dropped by his agent. Prior to this he was flourishing.'\nThey continued: 'People close to Justin believe Blake and Ryan deserve to be bankrupted for trying to ruin the lives of Justin and others involved in this legal nightmare.'\n\nBaldoni also accused Lively of hijacking the filming of It Ends With Us, which he directed, and claimed she forced him and his family to wait in a basement holding area at the premiere so she did not have to see him\nLively and Reynolds reportedly have a combined net worth of $380 million, which is largely thanks to his numerous lucrative off-screen ventures. \nOver the years, he has had a stake in several businesses, including Aviation Gin, Mint Mobile, and FuboTV.\nIn 2020, the actor sold his stake in Aviation Gin to Diageo, one of the world's largest producers of spirits and beers, in a deal worth up to $610 million. \nThat same year, he famously purchased Wrexham Football Club along with actor Rob McElhenney for $2.5 million. \nOn top of this, Reynolds' darkly comic portrayal of the flawed superhero Deadpool in the eponymous 2016 and 2018 films made him one of Hollywood's highest-paid actors.\nLively has also exercised her entrepreneurial streak in recent years with multiple brands including her gourmet mixer venture Betty Buzz, which sold 2.5 Million bottles within seven months of the launch back in 2021, Betty Booze - premium cocktails - and her new Blake Brown Beauty line. \nTogether, Lively and Reynolds have also showed off their philanthropic side, having previously donated $500,000 to Feeding America and $500,000 to Food Banks Canada during the start of the COVID-19 lockdown in March 2020. \n\nWhile many have questioned why Baldoni is going after the specific sum, a source exclusively told DailyMail.com that he deduced the figure from Lively and Reynolds' reported net worth (seen \nThe couple faced a torrent of allegations against them when Baldoni fired back with a counter suit earlier this month.\nThe actor accused Reynolds of 'swearing' and 'berating him in an aggressive tirade' at a meeting held at the couple's New York penthouse - where Reynolds was present as his wife's 'representative' to discuss Baldoni's conduct.\nLively's attorneys issued a fiery statement to DailyMail.com in response to the lawsuit, branding it 'another chapter in the abuser playbook.'\n'This is an age-old story: A woman speaks up with concrete evidence of sexual harassment and retaliation and the abuser attempts to turn the tables on the victim,' they said. 'This is what experts call DARVO. Deny. Attack. Reverse Victim Offender.'\nThe statement claimed Baldoni's production company Wayfarer Studios 'opted to use the resources of its billionaire co-founder to issue media statements, launch meritless lawsuits, and threaten litigation to overwhelm the public's ability to understand that what they are doing is retaliation against sexual harassment allegations.'\nBaldoni's attorney Bryan Freedman explained his client's decision to sue.\n'This lawsuit is a legal action based on an overwhelming amount of untampered evidence detailing Blake Lively and her team's duplicitous attempt to destroy Justin Baldoni, his team and their respective companies by disseminating grossly edited, unsubstantiated, new and doctored information to the media,' he said in a statement.\n'This is a battle she will not win and will certainly regret. Blake Lively was either severely misled by her team or intentionally and knowingly misrepresented the truth.'\n\nLively and Reynolds reportedly have a combined net worth of $380 million, which is largely thanks to his numerous lucrative off-screen ventures; seen on August 06, 2024\nOn Monday, DailyMail.com published exclusive audio which sheds further light on the feud which arose when Lively made changes to the rooftop scene in the romantic drama film – not all of which were met with unqualified praise.\nBaldoni can be heard offering the actress a groveling apology and noting 'I fell short' over his response to her changes. \nIn the full audio message, which is just over six and a half minutes long, he goes on to say that he is pleased she feels comfortable enough to tell him that and describes himself as 'a very flawed man, as my wife will say.' \nIt came days after video footage appeared to pull Lively's sexual harassment claims into question.\nThe actress accused Baldoni of dragging his lips down her neck and telling her ‘it smells so good’ while filming a dance scene, with Lively claiming in her civil rights complaint that nobody overheard because the microphones were switched off.\nBut the tapes show how friendly the two stars were, with the pair laughing and joking around, joshing about the size of Baldoni’s nose and even talking about how they spend their time with their spouses. \nBlake LivelyJustin Baldoni\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nBlake Lively's brother-in-law apologizes to Justin Baldoni in shocking twist amid $400M lawsuit\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nEXCLUSIVETaylor Swift taking a 'step back' from Blake Lively as dramatic legal battle with Justin Baldoni threatens their decade-long friendship\n\nCriminal Love Island star Jack Fincham walks free from court with his Towie girlfriend after being jailed for six weeks for dog attack\n\nBREAKING NEWSRihanna makes shock court appearance to support boyfriend A$AP Rocky who faces 24 years prison\n\nVanessa Feltz's ex Ben Ofoedu breaks his silence on their calamitous split and reveals how he REALLY feels about her: EDEN CONFIDENTIAL\n\n'Nervous' Stacey Solomon reveals she's finally able to share huge news with husband Joe Swash\n\nSomething for everyone!

Due to the ongoing investigation, more info may be released later today.’\n\nThe takeover of the apartment complex shocked American after security cameras filmed six men armed with guns in the complex brazenly trying to access units in August, 2024. \n\nThe takeover became a defining election moment as public anger mounted over America’s porous borders when ABC host Martha Raddatz told JD Vance that ‘only a hand full’ of apartment blocks had been seized by the gang.\n\n‘Martha, do you hear yourself? Only ‘a handful of apartment complexes’ in America were taken over by Venezuelan gangs, and Donald Trump is the problem and not Kamala Harris’ open border?’, Vance responded. \n\nICE officials said on Tuesday that they arrested one of the alleged gangsters seen in the footage in New York City. \n\nAnderson Zambrano-Pacheco, 26, is wanted in Colorado on felony warrants and was arrested in the Bronx, according to officials. \n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem attended Tuesday’s dawn raid and confirmed an an individual with kidnapping, assault and burglary charges was taken into custody.\n\nShe shared footage of the swoop on X and vowed to clamp down on ‘dirtbags.’\n\n‘Dirtbags like this will continue to be removed from our streets,’ Noem wrote. ‘We are doing this right – doing exactly what President Trump promised the American people – making our streets safe.’\n\nThe DEA has been conducting operations in the Denver area as they target undocumented criminals with criminal records.\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration officials found 49 people inside a makeshift nightclub in Adams County on Sunday morning – 41 of which were undocumented migrants.\n\nFederal officials said some of those detained were associated with the violent Tren de Aragua which has been terrorizing the neighborhood.\n\nThe early morning raid was conducted alongside officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n\n‘Drugs, weapons, and cash were seized in Adams County,’ officials said on X.\n\n‘Nearly 50 illegal aliens were taken into custody.’ The party was ‘invite only’, officials said.\n\nKnown as TdA to law enforcement, the gang originated in a Venezuelan prison.\n\nMembers of the South American mafia have since crept into the US via the southern border, hidden among the one million Venezuelan migrants fleeing a socialist dictatorship who have entered the country under the Biden administration.\n\nIt emerged in December that Tren de Aragua, which has been dubbed the ‘epitome of evil’ and ‘MS-13 on steroids’, is already operating in 18 states.\n\nThis includes some of the most remote corners of the America in Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming. The bloodthirsty criminals also maintain strongholds in major cities across Texas as well as New York and Chicago.\n\nThey can often be identified by telltale tattoos, including a train (‘tren’ is Spanish for train), a crown, a clock and an AK-47.\n\nAfter slipping across the southern border posing as asylum-seekers, gang members infiltrated at least three apartment complexes in the area.\n\nTdA thugs took over vacant apartment units to use a drug and prostitution dens– pimping out migrant women and even children.\n\nOther migrants who lived in those properties were forced to pay the gangsters ‘rent’ or face violence.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump&#8217;s &#8216;war&#8217; against illegal migrants has scored a stunning symbolic victory&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump achieves a significant symbolic triumph as authorities eliminate the United States&#8217; most infamous illegal immigrant hotspot first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-achieves-a-significant-symbolic-triumph-as-authorities-eliminate-the-united-states-most-infamous-illegal-immigrant-hotspot/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/rewrite-this-title-Trump-scores-stunning-symbolic-victory-as-feds.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 19:08:49","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.01},{"id":285246136,"title":"She worked with Blake Lively and Cher while starring in a big Disney movie and is wed to a hunk, who is she?","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jan 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorrifying moment man is stabbed in the neck after accidentally bumping into a stranger in subway station\n\nLove Island Jack Fincham seen for the first time as he's FREED on bail after being sentenced to six weeks in jail for dog attack\n\nPictured: Female hospital worker, 51, charged with plot to kidnap, rape and murder a girl under 13\n\nExpert reveals four red flag signs your cold is actually something sinister - including cancer\n\nI was a prolific middle-class shoplifter for months until I was caught in the act.

I didn't recognise myself.'\n'The perimenopause and menopause have such an impact on your confidence and I lost myself for a little while.'\nThe star went on to explain how she was her 'heaviest' in 2018, however, HRT (hormone replacement therapy) helped ease many of her symptoms.\n\nOn Thursday, Lisa took to Instagram Stories to share snaps in a snakeskin print bikini as she danced around for the camera\n\nShe put her incredible figure on display in a selection of skimpy bikinis as she celebrated her 53rd birthday on holiday\n\nProving just how she stays in shape, Lisa also revealed that she began her birthday with a 7am workout, posing with George in her workout gear\nShe also revealed that she went on to lose two-stone after focusing on exercise and eating the right foods for her mind and body.\nShe admitted to Closer that she had 'no grip' on her cravings before and revealed she started 'listening to her body.'\nLisa revealed in 2021 that she was prescribed antidepressants after experiencing low moods and anxiety as a result of early menopause.\nThe presenter, who suffers from endometriosis started experiencing depression around 10 years ago but had no idea her symptoms were a result of the perimenopause.\nAppearing on Lorraine at the time, she explained that her 2016 appearance on I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here! was worsened by 'debilitating' periods, low energy and 'brain fog', revealing she relied on the pill to stop her irregular cycle.\nIt wasn't until being prescribed Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT) that Lisa was able to 'take ownership' of her health, hailing the treatment as a 'game-changer' and insisting she 'wouldn't be without it'.\n'When I look back it did creep up on me, it wasn't a definite pinpoint the actual day I knew I was going into perimenopause,' Lisa explained.\n'When I look back it was about seven years ago when I started experiencing low mood, depression, anxiety and I was managing it because I just thought that was what was wrong with me, maybe I was just a bit unhappy.'\n'I got prescribed antidepressants and that wasn't what I needed but I thought I did. The symptoms started evolving and it was painful periods, awful cycles, really irregular, all these other symptoms started coming up and it was a juggling act. It was really hard to work out what was going on.'\n\nYet she did allow herself to indulge later in the day as she revealed she was enjoying a beer on the beach\n\nAfter signing up as a contestant on the ITV reality show I'm A Celeb, Lisa began having periods so painful she struggled to leave the house - but still had no idea that she was exhibiting signs of menopause.\n'It was such a shame,' she said. 'I said yes to going into the jungle and I was really excited about it and in the months leading up to it I had debilitating cycles and really irregular, almost where I couldn't leave the house and I didn't know what to do.'\n'I already suffer from endometriosis, so I'm used to having very painful cycles but I thought \"What am I going to do?

His White House also issued a temporary pause on all federal grants and loans starting on Tuesday, a decision met with widespread backlash from Democrats. \n\nFormer advisor to President Barack Obama, Dan Pfeiffer, says Democrats are being too “silent” on Trump’s return to office.\n\n“During the first week of Trump 2.0, too many elected Dems have been silent. They seem to be waiting for the exact right message,” he wrote on social media platform X.\n\n“But if there is one lesson from the Trump era, it’s this: when it comes to messaging, volume and frequency are vastly more important than precision,” he said. \n\n“Saying nothing is worse than saying the wrong thing. Just get out there and start talking. No slogans, no jargon, just talk like a human; and talk about Trump,” he added.\n\nIan Sams, a former advisor to President Joe Biden and spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris, agreed with Pfeiffer in a post on X. He suggested that Democrats need to get out their message more through interviews and podcast appearances. \n\n“Could not agree more with Dan here. More Democratic leaders need to flood the airwaves, podcasts, social media, everywhere to speak up about what’s happening in America right now. We have a lot to learn about how best to regain Americans' trust but we won’t get there by silence,” he added. \n\nPlenty of other Democratic pundits have echoed these criticisms. \n\nNew York Times columnist Ezra Klein and MSNBC anchor Chris Hayes said in podcast earlier this month that Democrats need to focus more on the “volume of attention” they receive, rather than focusing on the “type of attention.”\n\n“I think there’s another distinction between Democrats and Republicans here, which is that I think Democrats still believe that the type of attention you get is the most important thing. If your choice is between a lot of negative attention and no attention, go for no attention,” Klein said earlier this month. \n\nOur journalism needs your support.

So far, these are mostly hardened criminals, the world’s riff-raff whom the blue party argued for years must be given sanctuary from Trump so they weren’t held to account for their predations on American citizens. But Democrats don’t want to be seen that way anymore, and their foot-shuffling embarrassment while Trump flies undesirables home is part of an effort to execute a U-turn away from what lost them the White House and Capitol Hill in the November election.\n\nJoe Biden and Kamala Harris knew they needed to change course in 2024 to avoid the crushing defeat that their bosses, former President Barack Obama and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), could see hurtling toward them. So, having culpably opened wide the southern border, they suddenly presented themselves as tougher on illegal immigration than the GOP. This ludicrous claim was precariously balanced on Republicans’ rejection, under orders from Trump, of a border bill that was camouflaged to look serious but would actually have facilitated a continued flood of illegal immigrants.\n\nElection results, however, have a way of clarifying matters, and, in a flash of Damascene light, Democrats saw that their policy of facilitating mass illegal immigration is unpopular. It is also utterly immoral, which is another reason why Americans hate it. Citizens of a nation-state must have the right to decide who they let into their country to live with them.\n\nDemocrats are in a quandary. Their muscle memory, which was developed over decades, is to support anything that works against America. This has been reinforced in recent years by an instinct to reverse everything advocated by Trump. But they don’t want the orange man to get all the credit for restoring national sovereignty. They want voters to see them as protecting America, too.\n\nSo they’re stuck. When Trump jabbed his finger into the chest of Colombia’s recalcitrant pipsqueak president, Gustavo Petro, last weekend and forced him to take back Colombian criminals illegally in the United States, there was hardly a peep from Democrats.\n\nIt’s true that Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), perhaps recalling her days as a barmaid, fretted that retaliatory tariffs would push up the cost of a cup of coffee. But that protest hardly matched her histrionics during Trump’s first administration, when she collapsed in a puddle of grief for photographers outside a Texas facility holding illegal immigrants.\n\nNow that Biden is safely dispatched to the ash heap of presidential failures, Democrats don’t mind that Obama was sometimes referred to as “deporter in chief.” In those long-ago days of fiscal 2009, he deported 389,834 illegal immigrants, continuing the policies of former President George W. Bush, who in the previous year deported 369,221. Indeed, Obama kept expelling large numbers for most of his presidency. It was only in his last year, fiscal 2016, that deportations collapsed to 65,332.\n\nWhat happened? Democrats, including such hard lefties as socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), who previously opposed mass low-skill immigration because it depressed domestic wages, caved to activists and ideologues who took the intersectional and postnational view that America was an illegitimate and racist country that should not exclude anyone from a poor nation who wanted to live here.\n\nSuch malign leftist thinking dominated Democrats’ agenda for the next eight years, through Trump’s first term and Biden’s only term in the White House. Its consequence was the abandonment of low-skill American workers, who disliked being sacrificed to wokeism and so became fervent MAGA supporters.\n\nPoliticians and parties want power more than anything else and, after a painful period in the wilderness, generally abandon ideas and policies that keep them from winning elections. So Democrats now want to lure blue-collar workers back. The party is still saturated with the anti-American prejudices that got it into trouble, but it wants to shed that unattractive image, and the first step in doing so is to avoid decrying deportations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nThose now making the most noise against Trump’s mass expulsions are the pressure groups and activists — “immigrants’ rights groups” — who transformed the party’s policies on the border and immigration during the Obama years.\n\nThey will try to keep Democrats from slinking away and adopting policies that might win back voters. But these postnationalists are likely to find Democrats less willing to listen than they were before. Even so, while watching the Democrats do their U-turn, don’t hold your breath waiting for them to admit, “We got it wrong.”","summary":"Politics means never having to say you’re sorry.

Due to the ongoing investigation, more info may be released later today.'\n\nThe takeover of the apartment complex shocked American after security cameras filmed six men armed with guns in the complex brazenly trying to access units in August, 2024. \n\nThe takeover became a defining election moment as public anger mounted over America's porous borders when ABC host Martha Raddatz told JD Vance that 'only a hand full' of apartment blocks had been seized by the gang.\n\n'Martha, do you hear yourself? Only 'a handful of apartment complexes' in America were taken over by Venezuelan gangs, and Donald Trump is the problem and not Kamala Harris' open border?', Vance responded. \n\nICE officials said on Tuesday that they arrested one of the alleged gangsters seen in the footage in New York City. \n\nAnderson Zambrano-Pacheco, 26, is wanted in Colorado on felony warrants and was arrested in the Bronx, according to officials. \n\nSecretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem attended Tuesday's dawn raid and confirmed an an individual with kidnapping, assault and burglary charges was taken into custody.\n\nShe shared footage of the swoop on X and vowed to clamp down on 'dirtbags.'\n\n'Dirtbags like this will continue to be removed from our streets,' Noem wrote. 'We are doing this right - doing exactly what President Trump promised the American people - making our streets safe.'\n\nThe DEA has been conducting operations in the Denver area as they target undocumented criminals with criminal records.\n\nDrug Enforcement Administration officials found 49 people inside a makeshift nightclub in Adams County on Sunday morning - 41 of which were undocumented migrants.\n\nFederal officials said some of those detained were associated with the violent Tren de Aragua which has been terrorizing the neighborhood.\n\nThe early morning raid was conducted alongside officers from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).\n\n'Drugs, weapons, and cash were seized in Adams County,' officials said on X.\n\n'Nearly 50 illegal aliens were taken into custody.' The party was 'invite only', officials said.\n\nKnown as TdA to law enforcement, the gang originated in a Venezuelan prison.\n\nMembers of the South American mafia have since crept into the US via the southern border, hidden among the one million Venezuelan migrants fleeing a socialist dictatorship who have entered the country under the Biden administration.\n\nIt emerged in December that Tren de Aragua, which has been dubbed the 'epitome of evil' and 'MS-13 on steroids', is already operating in 18 states.\n\nThis includes some of the most remote corners of the America in Colorado, North Dakota, Montana, Nevada and Wyoming. The bloodthirsty criminals also maintain strongholds in major cities across Texas as well as New York and Chicago.\n\nThey can often be identified by telltale tattoos, including a train ('tren' is Spanish for train), a crown, a clock and an AK-47.\n\nAfter slipping across the southern border posing as asylum-seekers, gang members infiltrated at least three apartment complexes in the area.\n\nTdA thugs took over vacant apartment units to use a drug and prostitution dens-- pimping out migrant women and even children.\n\nOther migrants who lived in those properties were forced to pay the gangsters 'rent' or face violence.","summary":"The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Colorado said they arrested a suspected member of the Venezuelan Tren de Aragua gang overnight.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14338465/incredible-moment-trump-migrant-raid-aurora-apartments-tren-aragua.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/29/16/94643137-0-image-a-84_1738167982144.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 18:27:50","author":"Editor,Germania Rodriguez Poleo,Maryann Martinez","authors":["Editor","Germania Rodriguez Poleo","Maryann Martinez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.021},{"id":285225308,"title":"Reese Witherspoon looks chic in blue suit as she reveals update for Legally Blonde prequel series","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jan 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorrifying moment man is stabbed in the neck after accidentally bumping into a stranger in subway station\n\nLove Island Jack Fincham seen for the first time as he's FREED on bail after being sentenced to six weeks in jail for dog attack\n\nPictured: Female hospital worker, 51, charged with plot to kidnap, rape and murder a girl under 13\n\nExpert reveals four red flag signs your cold is actually something sinister - including cancer\n\nI was a prolific middle-class shoplifter for months until I was caught in the act.

Enhance.”\n\nTrump also pointed out: “The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. That makes the other guy smell blood, and then you’re dead.”\n\nThere is no doubt he smelt Starmer’s blood as the Labour government sweated over the Mandelson situation and the complaints about slights against the new president with the 100 Labour activists helping Kamala Harris.\n\nThe desperation to get the PM’s nominee into Washington certainly handed the power to Trump, which has left some questioning why Starmer decided to go with Mandelson in the first place.\n\nWe should not have been surprised about what has happened because Trump’s people had told Starmer’s chief of staff Morgan McSweeney that they did not want Mandelson.\n\nAdd that to all the other perceived insults and Trump’s reflection in his book acts as a warning.\n\n“When people treat me badly or unfairly or try to take advantage of me, my general attitude, all my life, has been to fight back very hard.”\n\nBut what would Trump want to extract from Starmer in an agreement over allowing Mandelson?\n\nAs Trump noted in his book: “Money was never a big motivation for me, except as a way to keep score. The real excitement is playing the game.”\n\nThere seems to be no doubt that Trump wants Labour to go to some lengths to pull back on the insults they threw his way after he was elected in 2016 for his first term.\n\nIt was notable that once his appointment was confirmed Mandelson was on Fox News publicly recanting his previous criticism of Trump and praising 47th president. Similar things have already been said by Starmer and foreign secretary David Lammy.\n\nThe biggest thing though will be Trump’s visit to the UK. Sources close to the president have made it clear he was offended that, unlike Barack Obama, he was not allowed to address a joint sitting of the Houses of Parliament. A major reason for that was objections led by Starmer, Lammy, and now minister for the Americas, Stephen Doughty.\n\nA reversal of that position and a speech to the Commons and Lords now looks like it is on the cards.\n\nThere will also be agreements regarding Mandelson himself. As one source put it: “He will be kept on a short leash.”\n\nThis is particularly in regard to his closeness to China.\n\nIn the end though, there is one soft spot with President Trump which the prime minister can and is already exploiting - he loves the royals and adored the late Queen (as he told me himself).\n\nOne thing that was suggested from across the Atlantic is that people are now looking for an announcement on a visit to the White House or even Mar-a-Lago by a major royal. Maybe King Charles, more likely the Prince and Princess of Wales.\n\nHe would be a huge honour for the president to host a royal visit and one he would personally relish.\n\nAdded to that, there is no doubt he will want the royal treatment when he visits the UK - a banquet and the rest.\n\nBut diplomatic sources told The Independent Starmer had already identified the power of the royals in dealings with Trump. This was why it was Prince William who was sent to the reopening of Notre Dame in Paris with the arranged meeting with Trump.\n\n“Expect the Prince of Wales to be a regular feature in dealings with the Trump administration,” one diplomat told The Independent last week.\n\nGiven what is on the agenda between the UK and US though, the Prince of Wales may need to start buffing up on trade deals.","summary":"Trump and Starmer have resolved their differences on Lord Mandelson but at what cost to the prime minister?

(Cournoyer resigned the seat to become Iowa’s lieutenant governor, creating the vacancy.)\n\nZimmer’s win should give Republicans a case of heartburn since special election results often correlate with the outcome in the next midterm election. \n\nDemocrats saw a similar overperformance in special elections in 2017, after Trump took office the first time. Those special election victories turned out to be the precursor to Democrats taking back the U.S. House and winning big in state-legislative races in 2018.\n\n“This earthquake victory in Iowa puts Republicans across the country on notice,” Heather Williams, president of the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee, said in a statement. “In a ruby red district that Trump won by 21 points, DLCC candidate Mike Zimmer clinched a comfortable win against his extreme MAGA opponent. Tonight’s win marks the first flip of the cycle and builds on key majority-making wins in Virginia earlier this month. The DLCC is starting the new cycle strong just a month into 2025—from battlegrounds to Republican territory. We have dozens more special elections on the horizon—we’re only just getting started.”\n\nIt wasn’t just Zimmer who overperformed in a special election on Tuesday.\n\nIn Minnesota, Democrats won a state Senate district by a 91%-to-9% margin to win a majority in the chamber. In November, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris carried this same district, with 83% to Trump’s 14%—making Tuesday’s results a sizable swing toward Democrats, according to data from the Downballot.\n\nUltimately, Zimmer’s performance also gives Democrats hope in upcoming congressional special elections. \n\nRepublican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York is expected to leave her seat to be Trump’s ambassador to the United Nations, and her district’s partisanship is similar to that of the Iowa state Senate seat Democrats just won.\n\n“Democrats just flipped a Trump +21 Iowa state Senate seat in the first special election since Trump assumed office. Of note: New York’s 21st District, which Elise Stefanik is vacating soon, was also Trump +21 in 2024,” Jacob Rubashkin, deputy editor of the election-analysis outlet Inside Elections, wrote in a post on X.","summary":"Democrats on Tuesday flipped an Iowa state Senate seat in a district Donald Trump carried by 21 percentage points just a few months earlier, an incredible special election result that may serve as an early warning signal for Republicans about the 2026 midterms.\n\n\n\nDemocrat Mike Zimmer defeated Republican Kate Whittington, 52% to 48%, in a special election for Senate District 35—a rural seat located on the state’s eastern side. \n\n\n\nIn November 2022, Republican Chris Cournoyer defeated her Democratic opponent, 61% to 39%, in this same seat—making Zimmer's win a massive shift toward Democrats.

On Tuesday night, Walz, who was former Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate in the 2024 election, was reacting to how “fatigued” the Democratic Party is to the countless actions the Trump administration has taken in its first 10 days when he made the accusation against Musk.\n\n“We spent three days debating, having them trying to debate that President Musk gave a Nazi salute — of course, he did,” Walz said on MSNBC. “But that is a distraction from what I think, you said it: This is game-on stuff right here.”\n\nWalz’s comments were shared online by X user Robby Starbuck, who suggested that Musk sue the governor “for all he’s worth.” Musk responded, “I think I will,” adding that Walz is “creepy.”\n\nI think I will. Tim Walz is a creepy 🤡— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 29, 2025\n\nAmid the debate over Musk’s gesture at Capital One Arena, the Anti-Defamation League stated that Musk performed “an awkward gesture in a moment of enthusiasm, not a Nazi salute.” Star Trek icon William Shatner also said he did not believe Musk did “a gesture associated with hate,” to which Musk responded with a heart emoji.\n\nThat is a “I don’t believe he was performing a gesture associated with hate” post. https://t.co/M5UGr1b8oM— William Shatner (@WilliamShatner) January 26, 2025\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nDuring his Tuesday interview, Walz reflected on the “pure hell” that he and other Democrats experienced after the party lost the 2024 presidential election and said he has conducted some “soul-searching” on what could have been done differently ahead of Election Day.\n\nWalz is serving his second gubernatorial term and can seek reelection in 2026 because Minnesota governors are not bound by term limits. When asked about this possibility after the presidential election, Walz said he would listen to the support he has if it is still present and that any decisions about his political future will be made sometime this year.","summary":"Billionaire and X owner Elon Musk has expressed interest in suing Gov.

Monday’s plea deal and felony conviction ends a criminal case that has dragged through the court system since 2017.\n\nTheir explosive videos triggered multiple state investigations into the allegations, some of which were led by Republican attorneys general. Those inquiries cleared Planned Parenthood of any wrongdoing, but court cases related to the videos are ongoing. \n\nDaleiden and Merritt pleaded no contest in San Francisco Superior Court and waived any right to appeal. A sentencing hearing will happen roughly a year from now.\n\nAttorney General Rob Bonta, who has taken a firm stance supporting abortion access, said in a statement that the conviction helps ensure California residents can exercise their state constitutional rights to reproductive health care.\n\n“We will not hesitate to continue taking action against those who threaten access to abortion care — whether by recording confidential conversations or other means,” Bonta said.\n\nThe conviction comes less than a week after President Donald Trump limited federal enforcement of a law meant to protect abortion clinic workers and pardoned 23 anti-abortion activists convicted of harassing abortion clinic workers.\n\nThe terms of the plea agreement prohibit Daleiden and Merritt from contacting or naming any of the victims of the illegal recordings. They must also obey all laws.\n\nDaleiden downplayed the felony conviction in a statement on his website, Center for Medical Progress, saying that the conviction comes with “zero punishment.”\n\n“After enduring 9 years of weaponized political prosecution, putting an end to the lawfare launched by Kamala Harris is a huge victory for my investigative reporting and for the public’s right to know the truth about Planned Parenthood’s sale of aborted baby body parts,” Daleiden said.\n\nAt the time, then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris launched an investigation into Daleiden and Merritt’s actions after they published a series of videos showing covertly filmed conversations of Planned Parenthood executives discussing abortion procedures and how tissue is collected and exchanged with research companies. \n\nDonating fetal tissue to researchers and recouping expenses is legal under U.S. law and states may impose additional regulations.\n\nThe recordings sparked a firestorm of national outrage, particularly from conservative activists and lawmakers who oppose abortion, fueling calls to defund Planned Parenthood. The subjects of the recordings received death threats in the aftermath. \n\nPlanned Parenthood won a $2.2 million civil lawsuit in San Francisco against Daleiden and Merritt for violating fraud, trespassing and recording laws.\n\nIn an unsigned statement, Bonta’s office said it disagreed with Daleiden’s characterization of the plea deal.\n\n“Make no mistake: the defendants are now convicted felons. They are guilty of feloniously recording private communications.”\n\nUnder California law, Daleiden and Merritt are eligible to ask a judge to reduce the conviction to a misdemeanor in 12 months if they adhere to the terms of the plea deal.\n\nSupported by the California Health Care Foundation (CHCF), which works to ensure that people have access to the care they need, when they need it, at a price they can afford.

Many prominent artists from Beyoncé to Bruce Springsteen prohibit Trump from using their music. So why do Village People – a band synonymous with the 1970s gay liberation movement – allow their music to be associated with a political movement that has fixed and repressive ideas about sexual identity and morality?\n\nVillage People’s recent incarnation has had a complicated relationship with the “make America great again” movement (Maga). In 2020, their song YMCA began featuring at Maga anti-lockdown rallies and soon became a prominent song in Trump’s re-election campaign.\n\nAt the time, the band asked Trump not to use its music and later supported Kamala Harris for the presidency in 2024. Since then Village People have dramatically changed tack.\n\nTo be clear, of the group that performed at Trump’s pre-inauguration rally, only one of the original Village People remains. The band, put together by the gay producers Jacques Morali and Henri Belolo in 1978, was named after New York’s Greenwich Village gay scene.\n\nLooking for something good? Cut through the noise with a carefully curated selection of the latest releases, live events and exhibitions, straight to your inbox every fortnight, on Fridays. Sign up here.\n\nIn the 1970s, the group was mostly gay-fronted except the first recruit, lead singer and co-songwriter Victor Willis (sometimes the policeman, sometimes the admiral figure). Willis took control of the name and the hits in 2017 after an out-of-court settlement with co-owner Henri Belolo.\n\nWillis is now the only member of the original line up still performing under the official band name. Perhaps to ensure mainstream popularity, he has tried to move Village People away from its gay associations – the biography on the band’s website makes no mention of the act’s significance to queer audiences. He recently wrote on Facebook that he will sue every news organisation that suggests “YMCA is somehow a gay anthem”.\n\nBut it’s difficult to untangle Village People from queer history as it was the trendsetting gay community of underground disco culture that made them famous. Record companies selected the songs and artists to promote based on how DJs reported their popularity in the hottest clubs. Many of these clubs were gay dominated, and disco itself was tied up with the growing confidence of the gay liberation movement in America and the era of sexual liberalisation that followed the 1960s.\n\nJacques Morali put together Village People knowing the band could offer influential gay clubbers something they had always been denied: cultural representation, and with it, acknowledgement of their existence.\n\nIt worked. One self-proclaimed “disco doll” writing to LGBTQ+ newspaper The Advocate in 1978 recalled first hearing Village People: “The music was very hot … and the words were about us, about our scene. I couldn’t believe it.”\n\nVillage People’s innuendos and knowing references to gay culture often went over the heads of many straight listeners. Songs like Macho Man and the group’s hypermasculine image epitomised the “clone” movement in 1970s gay culture. \n\nQueer men, long derided for being effeminate, would bulk up at the gym and dress in leathers like bikers, effectively becoming more of an embodiment of masculinity than straight men. Go West was a reference to San Francisco’s more liberal environment for gay men. The YMCA was a place to “hang out with all the boys”. \n\nBut skyrocketing into the mainstream made Village People an awkward fit for gay disco culture. This vibrant community wanted their own scene that was not part of the mainstream. They felt betrayed by a band publicly denying their gayness as they juggled the hardcore homosexual audience that had made them famous alongside a family-friendly audience.\n\nThe backlash was fierce. A 1978 letter to gay lib magazine The Body Politic declared: “The commercial exploiters are disguising it to gain the commercially lucrative straight audience”, describing Village People as “traitors of the worst kind”.\n\nBut even if they became momentarily unpopular in the hottest gay clubs, for many LGBTQ+ people, Village People’s hits have endured as anthems played at queer nights and Pride events. In their sound, appearance and sheer 1970-ness, they are undeniably camp icons.\n\nWhich of course leads many to question why people attending Trump’s rallies – hardly famous for their inclusivity – would embrace their music. One explanation is that Maga audiences simply do not care about past gay associations as the music is simple, catchy and positive.\n\nAnother is that just like the 1970s, the queer messaging of Village People’s music still goes over the heads of straight Maga audiences. Perhaps despite its past gay associations, they are consciously trying to culturally repurpose disco for their own movement. Or they’re trying to be ironic.\n\nMost likely, though, the music might have a particular meaning to LGBTQ+ audiences, it has other meanings depending on the context in which it is played. To many, Village People are the epitome of a novelty, apolitical pop group. Their hits are associated with weddings, children’s parties and good-time disco. The prosaic truth may be that Trump fans just enjoy a really catchy tune.\n\nBut for Trump’s team, the use of these songs is politically calculated toward their core supporters who have changed the lyrics of YMCA to “MAGA”. And don’t forget Village People were joined at the pre-inauguration rally by WWE wrestling’s Hulk Hogan. Both are nostalgic late 20th-century acts that revel in blatant performances of muscled masculinity.\n\nThey seem to be the embodiment of that imagined past of American virility that Trump vaguely refers to when he promises to make the nation “great again”. It’s not difficult to work out what Trump’s message is, especially when he dances along to Macho Man at rallies.\n\nBoth these acts are carnivalesque, like Trump himself. They indicate an era of politics as spectacle, but beneath the surface messages, we must carefully pay attention to what is actually being said and done.","summary":"The idea of Trump using the music of a  band famous for its gay anthems has perplexed many, but the Maga movement does seem to enjoy a catchy tune.","url":"https://theconversation.com/why-village-peoples-ymca-is-actually-a-great-fit-for-team-trump-248457","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/645221/original/file-20250128-19-t2pajj.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=5%2C5%2C3970%2C1982&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 17:05:59","author":"PhD Candidate in Modern American History,University of Exeter,William Rees","authors":["PhD Candidate in Modern American History","University of Exeter","William Rees"],"language":"en","source_country":"AU","sentiment":0.226},{"id":285217800,"title":"Selena Gomez’s emotional anti-Trump plea failed for a surprising reason","text":"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nSelena Gomez has shared an emotional video about Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown – and it unexpectedly united the left and right sides of the political aisle, with some calling her a ‘pathetic attention seeker.’\n\nIn a move that has left a bitter taste in the mouths of millions of Americans, the Disney star-turned-singer took to Instagram to share a tearful message in which she said, ‘All my people are being attacked, and children.’ \n\nGomez, who has Mexican heritage, sobbed: ‘I wish I could do something but I can’t.’ She captioned the post with ‘I’m sorry’ alongside a Mexican flag emoji.\n\nSince beginning his second term as president, the Trump administration has increased deportation efforts at the southern border and throughout the country, with 956 arrests taking place on Sunday alone, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\nGomez’s post was immediately controversial, with many right-wing pundits using it as an opportunity to rearticulate their anti-immigration agendas. Senatorial candidate Sam Parker even publicly called for the Only Murders in the Building actress to be deported. \n\nHe wrote on X: ‘Selena Gomez picked illegals over America b/c she’s the 3rd gen descendent of Mexican illegals who received citizenship in the ’87 Amnesty. She has an entitlement attitude toward America, like her illegal g’parents. Maybe Selena should be deported, too?’\n\n Selena Gomez was audibly sobbing throughout the video, expressing her grief over President Trump’s recent deportation of Mexican immigrants (Picture: selenagomez/Instagram)\n\n She captioned the post ‘I’m sorry’ with a Mexican flag emoji (Picture: selenagomez/Instagram)\n\nGomez then responded in her IG stories, writing: ‘Oh Mr. Parker, Mr. Parker. Thanks for the laugh and the threat.’\n\nShockingly, critics of her message have not just been people among the ultra-conservative, anti-immigration faction, but also young, left-wing Americans who have taken to the internet in droves to call Gomez’s post ‘cringey’ and ’embarrassing.’ \n\nAs a result, Gomez deleted the post and then returned to Instagram to post a slide that read: ‘Apparently it’s not OK to show empathy for people.’\n\nThe reaction to the emotionally raw video highlights a broader trend among young people online, where there is a noticeable shift away from sincerity and towards a relentless cycle of cynical irony. \n\nThis phenomenon can be traced back to a general disillusionment with celebrity virtue-signaling, performative activism, and the growing distrust of institutions and bureaucracy among young people. In fact, according to a 2023 study by the Pew Research Center, younger generations increasingly favor humour and sarcasm over sincere expressions.\n\nMany social media users, especially Gen Z, have grown weary of overly idealistic or sentimental content, viewing expression of emotion for the sake of expression as disingenuous or self-serving. \n\n The Only Murders in the Building actress has Mexican heritage (Picture: Instagram/Rick Gomez)\n\nSocial media influencer and podcast host Peyton Dix (@DixPeyton) posted on X: ‘I think it’s Selena Gomez takes a break from social media o’clock.’ \n\nPeyton has been an outspoken supporter of left-wing political causes in the past and has even previously posted about the damage Trump’s immigration policies are doing to communities in New York City. \n\nAnd yet, she clearly finds Gomez’s earnest show of emotion difficult to palate, and she’s not alone. \n\nMany other social media users, most of whom actually agree with Gomez’s political stance based on other content on their pages, also criticised the singer. \n\nX user @aleenaaaa00 wrote: ‘She always try to insert herself in the narrative.’\n\n American Border Czar Tom Homan responded to Gomez’s emotional plea with harsh words (Picture: Fox News)\n\n@HoneyGoldxx posted: ‘Selena really said, “This is my main character arc, y’all just extras in the plot.”’\n\n@ended_everyone agreed: ‘She’s a pathetic attention seeker.’\n\nSome users did seem to be on Gomez’s side, with @ChrissaSJE writing under criticism of Gomez’s post: ‘Bro yall doing a lot. She posted a video, yall talked s***. She took it down, yall still talking s***. If she was silent, yall would still be talking s***. Is SHE making it about her or are YALL?’ \n\nRapper Flavor Flav, also defended the show of emotion, writing on X: ‘Team Selena Gomez. Again. That woman is always so brave to share her truth, and so many are quick to bully her.’\n\nUser @valtnt01 wrote: ‘People forget she’s human too, she tried to show she cares.’ \n\n Gomez recently starred in the Oscar-nominated Mexican film Emilia Perez alongside Adriana Paz, Zoe Saldana and Karla Sofía Gascón (Picture: Kevin Mazur/Getty Images)\n\nWhile it does seem intuitive to assume that those who care about the plight of immigrants on the basis of treating everyone compassionately might reserve some of that compassion for Gomez, comments supporting Gomez seem to be firmly in the minority.\n\nThe discourse is reminiscent of the similar online furor that arose when Khloe Kardashian recently took to Instagram to criticise Mayor Karen Bass for cutting funding for the fire department prior to the devastating LA wildfires. \n\nWhile many users online agreed with what Kardashian had to say, they still hit out at her for saying it at all from a place of privilege. \n\nIt also brings to mind how quickly the internet ripped Gal Gadot’s Imagine video apart during the COVID-19 pandemic, calling the gesture vacuous and out of touch with the suffering of ‘real’ people – even though many agreed with the message of unity. \n\nAll of it indicates changing attitudes towards celebrities. While many people used to revere famous people without question and cheer on their efforts at political engagement wholeheartedly, there’s an obvious growing sense of disillusionment noticeable to anyone paying attention. \n\n The backlash got so loud that Gomez eventually deleted the post (Picture: John Salangsang/Shutterstock)\n\nEarnest attempts from celebrities at sharing personal feelings about an issue immediately earn ridicule and accusations of privilege, but silence in the face of injustice earns criticism as well. \n\nPrior to her endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 US Presidential Election, Taylor Swift was battling growing anger from fans who felt it was her responsibility to take a stand. \n\nThe rise of young, left-leaning people criticizing famous figures who get political may stem from a growing awareness of unfair class divides, elitism, and the risks of idolising the wealthy.\n\nIn summary, class solidarity is on the rise in America, and even Selena Gomez isn’t immune. \n\nContrastingly, billionaires are becoming increasingly venerable figures in the eyes of the American right while the largely left-leaning ‘Hollywood elite’ are being vilified by Trump and his party. \n\n The Good For You hitmaker recently got engaged to partner Benny Blanco (Picture: Instagram)\n\nSo is there any way for celebrities to use their platforms to express political opinions without facing backlash? \n\nPerhaps Gomez would have been better served by keeping her tears to herself, and instead offering her fans resources for how they could help immigrants who are at risk of deportation. \n\nOne X user, who prefers to remain anonymous but posted criticism of Gomez’s video, told Metro: ‘The problem is she’s making it about herself and her feelings instead of about the people actually being effected.’\n\nWhen asked if Gomez’s video served to at least raise awareness about the deportations, they scoffed and responded: ‘Everyone is aware of whats happening in America, but no one is doing anything. If celebrities want to help, they should open their pockets and get involved in real ways. We don’t have time for tears anymore.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.","summary":"'We don’t have time for tears anymore.'","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/01/29/selena-gomezs-emotional-anti-trump-plea-failed-a-surprising-reason-22457840/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/SEI_237789258-2de6.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 17:04:16","author":"Brooke Ivey Johnson","authors":["Brooke Ivey Johnson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":285195636,"title":"The Disgraceful Mob Over At 'Vogue' Smears Melania Trump While Creepily Idolizing Dr. Jill And Kamala","text":"Another day, another insufferable publication smearing a Trump. This time, it was Melania – our great First Lady, who also happens to be a hot supermodel known for her wardrobe. Seems like something that Vogue – yep, they still exist – would be all about, right? WRONG! Come on, you sheep. You thought a disgusting Lib rag would write something nice, fair and/or balanced about a Trump? You're better than that. You know better. For those who were fooled, shame on you. These wokes will never, ever stop. They'll never go away. You give ‘em an inch, they’ll take a mile and throw our great First Lady under the bus along the way. And that's exactly what they did this week with Melania, calling her a \"freelance magician\" with an \"airbrushed face.\" That's right. You stunned? Me neither. But wait, there's more! This same nasty publication sang a different tune last year when it was pumping out puff pieces on a couple former White House residents: Jill Biden and Kamala Harris. Ever heard of them? Well, Vogue thought they were the greatest, most sophisticated people in the world just last year, and a quick compare-and-contrast of the stories will make your heads spin. Let's dive right the hell in! I've never seen such gaslighting in my life, and that's saying something That's the Melania story – most of it, at least. I ain't linking back to it here because, frankly, those wackos don't deserve my pageviews. Piss off, Vogue. Now, let's go ahead and dig out a couple quotes from the two stories on Dr. Jill and Kamala Harris last year. First up? Dr. Jill, who, according to this very unbiased author, is the second coming of Jesus Christ: - The next time I see the first lady, it’s about 20 minutes later, and she’s stepping onstage at the ballroom of a nearby hotel. She has executed a remarkably swift wardrobe change—a total one-eighty, emerging to raucous applause at the launch event for Educators for Biden-Harris in a black T-shirt, black jeans, and black knee-high boots. She looks like she’s ready to party, and in a way, she is—these are her people. - Jill Biden’s pitch, I take it, is that these Americas, abstract and quotidian, are two sides of the same coin—that this country only works if it’s true to its core values, and that the point of those core values is to meet the needs of its citizenry. Soaring FLOTUS rhetoric on the one hand; on the other, down-to-earth Dr. B. - As we leave the ballroom that night, I finally get a chance to introduce myself to the first lady. I’m not sure how best to address her, so I stumble a bit over my words. \"Please,\" she says, brushing off my hesitation with a wave of a hand. \"Call me Jill.\" - Were I to close my eyes, I’d take Jill Biden for just about any teacher unburdening in a drab break room. - What I am trying to say is that Jill Biden is very good at meeting a moment. - Wherever we went, I’d see people approach the first lady and open their hearts. Oh yeah, I'm sure! That's what the American people notoriously did last year – race to Jill Biden and open their hearts. Nailed it. Nobody resonated more with the American people than … Jill Biden. Clearly the election results backed that up. Next up? Kamala! - Then the vice president enters amid a rain-like patter of footfalls, and the energy in the room changes. \"Hi! How are you? Good to see you again!\" Harris says, grabbing my hand and folding down into the opposite seat. - The hurricanes that barreled into Florida in recent days and brought heavy destruction as far as inland North Carolina have required rescue and recovery from officials and ordinary Americans, and Harris has moved quickly on the ground to show them her support. Hi, me again. Needed to cut in here real quick. That one is the biggest load of bullshit I've ever seen in my entire life. Kudos to Vogue here. This sort of gaslighting takes years of practice. Really well done. - When Biden’s announcement caused that pulse to drop a beat, the world looked to Harris with hopes and doubts. - A woman named Julie Sandler sporting chartreuse-colored hair and a chartreuse romper told me, \"I’m a fashion girlie! And a socialist! I thought the path to victory was getting narrower and narrower, but with Kamala it’s expanding.\" - Now I’m a state senator, and sometimes when I’m making a choice about how to dress—do I go a little more formal or a little more casual?—I hear Kamala’s voice in my head saying, ‘You need to look the part,’ and it helps me decide. Literally to this day. And that was 17 years ago.\" - The look was military, judicial, stabilizing, powerful: an advance vision of the commander in chief. - Harris’s speech was different, and announced a new era … Also different: She wore no white. Unlike many women onstage and in the arena, unlike Hillary Clinton accepting the nomination eight years earlier, Harris had forgone women’s-suffrage tones in favor of her Oval Office blues. That's enough. I can't take it anymore. I'm sure you can't, either. I can't believe I just spent 30 minutes thumbing through that crap for you folks. Don't you DARE accuse me of never doing anything for you. I haven't done Big J work like that in a long, long time. But when the mob attacks our great First Lady like they did this week, I have no choice but to respond. Hey, Vogue – piss right the hell off. We stand with Melania. You guys can have Dr. Jill and Kamala with their virtue-signaling pantsuits that forego women's-suffrage. We have this. We've already won.","summary":"","url":"https://www.outkick.com/culture/disgraceful-mob-over-vogue-smears-melania-trump-while-creepily-idolizing-dr-jill-kamala","image":"https://static.outkick.com/www.outkick.com/content/uploads/2025/01/melania.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 16:49:01","author":"Zach Dean","authors":["Zach Dean"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.076},{"id":285192458,"title":"The hysterically catty verdict on Hillary Clinton's 'figure' that stylists whisper behind her back... and why so many Democrat women have terrible fashion sense","text":"For a Democratic party now struggling to understand how it can compete with the charisma – and perhaps the policies – of a second Trump administration, the left would do well to convince Michelle Obama to take a deep breath and turn up at a few more public events.\n\nHer absence from President Trump's inauguration earlier this month meant that the 24.6 million people who tuned in to witness this spectacle looked from Melania's headlining chic directly on to a drab and completely uninspiring version of Democratic femininity.\n\nAmerica, said the newly inaugurated 47th President on January 20, has entered a new 'golden age.' And, indeed, when it came to his family's inauguration wardrobe choices, that new era might be more accurately described as 'the gilded age.'\n\nImmaculately coiffed and coutured, the Trump women, led by Melania and her stepdaughter Ivanka, reminded us all just what they're good at. It was hard to look away.\n\nMelania's slim-fit silk navy wool coatdress topped with a dramatic boater was at once elegant and mysterious since her eyes were almost entirely obscured by the hat's sumptuous brim. \n\nIt was an undoubted scene stealer, infusing Trump 2.0's leading lady with a regal aura that supporting actress Ivanka - clad in a green Dior 'New Look' skirt-suit complete with matching fascinator - echoed with seamless precision.\n\nMelania, above all, has mastered the art of performative dressing, combining razor-sharp tailoring with European chic. \n\nThese women had dressed to impress a nation primed for a show. Just as a queen wears a tiara to dazzle, a First Family (at least a Trump one) dons couture to wow. \n\nIt was all the more striking because the one woman who might have given Melania a run for her sartorial money wasn't there.\n\nA powerhouse in both the Democratic Party and the style stakes, Michelle Obama's presence would have infused the opposition with a touch of badly needed glamour.\n\nInstead, Kamala Harris sat front and center – a bleak vision of a female empowerment in a black tailored zipper jacket that betrayed not an inch of skin. Literally zipped-up.\n\nJill Biden, former First Lady, might have opted for color, but her vivid purple Ralph Lauren Collection suit, which folded awkwardly around her torso and which she debuted under a wrap coat, felt as disorganized as her blonde and blow-dried (in haste?) hair.\n\nA distinctly 1990s purse on a chain completed an ensemble that looked as fashion-backward as Melania's did forward.\n\nBoth Kamala and Jill Biden seemed unconcerned with projecting a more appealing or glamourous image of Democratic power.\n\nAnd yet, as Jill Biden's custom-made creation attests, these women are by no means dressing cheaply – a wrap coat similar to the one she wore retails for $5,490.\n\nAnd while much has been made of Melania's expensive European ensembles, few have commented upon (or even noticed) what is happening on the other side of the fence.\n\nTake Kamala's penchant for French-made Chloe power suits (a blazer retails for around $4,000 and trousers for around $1,500).\n\nThe custom navy creation that she wore to accept the Democratic presidential nomination in Chicago last August was designed personally by Chloe creative director Chemena Kamali.\n\nKamala paired the grain de poudre wool suit with a crepe de chine lavaliere blouse featuring tonal stripes.\n\nYet she failed to dazzle in this just as she had failed to dazzle in the tan version – another bespoke creation by Kamali – when she wore it two nights earlier.\n\nUnlike Melania, who enjoys little patronage from fashion brands and shops mostly from the rack, Kamala had received VIP treatment.\n\nYet the results were uninspiring and unremarkable, a foreshadowing of the lackluster Democratic campaign that followed.\n\nInstead of embracing the potential of a large clothing budget which she certainly has to project herself as a woman who could be simultaneously intelligent, powerful and stylish (something Michelle was never afraid to do), Kamala hid in designer duds that were as unexciting as they were expensive.\n\nWhen the time came for her first and only presidential debate in September, Kamala opted for Melania's staple, Dior, sporting a black single-breasted Bar jacket paired with the brand's signature matching trouser.\n\nYet in pairing it with a suffocating silk pussy-bow style blouse, Kamala disrupted the suit's sharp tailoring and ensured that her decision to showcase Dior - as she discussed middle class struggles - was largely obscured.\n\nWas this canny or just incompetent? Did voters detect something in the clothing of the would-be-first-female president that didn't satisfy?\n\nWhere Michelle who understood the power of style to communicate and embraced it, Kamala's look was uncertain, ill-defined and uninspiring. But why?\n\nUnlike the hard-to-fit figure of Hillary Clinton (master fitters at Ralph Lauren have struggled with this task for almost two decades now), Kamala could surely have found her footing and used her clothes to express herself. Her choices could have given voters a glimpse of her personality and invoked the authenticity that always eluded her no matter what words came out of her mouth.\n\nIt seems that Democratic women have chosen to shun what Melania has used to her advantage: the theatre of the political ring that, in an age of TikTok and Instagram, makes looking good more necessary than ever.\n\nYet in doing so, they have abandoned a trend that began with - and thrived under - two famous Democratic First Ladies.\n\nJackie Kennedy certainly understood the potential of a well-honed wardrobe to articulate wider ideas. That is why she chose to remain in her blood-stained pink Oleg Cassini suit as she stepped off the plane at Andrews Air Force Base to bring back the body of her dead husband in 1963.\n\nForty years later, Michelle Obama, too, reminded the world of the enormous potential that fashion can have on political success when used correctly.\n\nMichelle can credit her ingenious use of mixing high and low-end dressing - think her J. Crew cardigans and H&M dresses – for generating real cultural traction and a sense of authenticity.\n\nCan it be any surprise that she is now the most popular Democratic figure of all in the view of the American electorate?\n\nYet, in her absence, the stage is left for Melania, who last week reminded the world that, despite her outsider status, our new First Lady knows better than most the possibilities of a finely tuned wardrobe. And how politics actually works.","summary":"The 24.6million who tuned into watch President Trump's inauguration looked from Melania's headlining chic onto a drab and uninspiring version of Democratic femininity.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-14335275/Hillary-Clinton-figure-inauguration-stylists.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/29/16/94643111-0-image-m-22_1738166431679.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/01/21/4753305167260369686/1024x576_MP4_4753305167260369686.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-29 16:40:54","author":"Editor,Jane Marguerite Tippett","authors":["Editor","Jane Marguerite Tippett"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":0.276},{"id":285192492,"title":"Rebekah Vardy humiliated as her 'Wagatha Christie' business fails to make any profit after she tried to cash in on libel case against Coleen Rooney","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jan 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHorrifying moment man is stabbed in the neck after accidentally bumping into a stranger in subway station\n\nTruth about Wynne Evans' 'sad, derelict house': Star claimed home he bought before divorce had boarded-up windows and his children had to sleep in tents before £500,000 makeover\n\nPictured: Female hospital worker, 51, charged with plot to kidnap, rape and murder a girl under 13\n\nLove Island winner Jack Fincham is FREED on bail as he appeals six weeks jail sentence over Cane Corso Elvis' attack on jogger\n\nJennifer Aniston's menopause-busting workout has been hailed by top experts... but can it REALLY get my 54-year-old body into the same shape as hers?

Email tips@dailymail.com \nBy MATTHEW ACTON FOR MAILONLINE \n Published:16:21 GMT, 29 January 2025 |Updated:16:38 GMT, 29 January 2025 \n\nRebekah Vardy has so far failed to make a penny from her business Wagatha Christie International Ltd.\nShe had hoped to make a mint from the courtroom drama by trademarking the name coined during her epic battle with Coleen Rooney.\nBut we can reveal that she's yet to monetise the catchphrase.\nBecky registered the catchy term for trademark in the UK in August 2022 through the company London Entertainment Inc Ltd which made two applications on her behalf.\nOne that covers a range of uses from broadcasting to beauty lotions, as well as non-alcoholic drinks, jewellery, stationery and fashion design was passed.\nBut accounts filed this week for Wagatha Christie International Ltd – of which Becky is the sole director – show the outfit is currently 'dormant' with assets of £100.\n\nRebekah Vardy has so far failed to make a penny from her business Wagatha Christie International Ltd \n\nShe had hoped to make a mint from the courtroom drama by trademarking the name coined during her epic battle with Coleen Rooney (seen on I'm A Celeb)\nIt comes after last November Rebekah was hit by another blow after her Wagatha Christie legal defeat.\nMailOnline revealed at the time that Rebekah had lost a challenge from upmarket linen firm Christy which blocked her from flogging Wagatha Christie-themed towels and sheets. \nThe company filed papers two years ago with the UK's Intellectual Property Office opposing the application from Rebekah's team.\nThey said the names were too similar and her enterprise could harm the firm's existing Christy trademark if she began selling towels and bed linen using the Wagatha Christie brand.\nAnd last November Rebekah's application took out all reference to towels and bed linen in an updated filing at the IPO.\nBoth sides produced evidence about the potential clash and trademark lawyers at the government department ruled in favour of the claims of Wellspun UK - makers of the pricey Christy brand. \nTrademark clashes can end up in the High Court in London - scene of Rebekah and Coleen Rooney's libel fight - if agreements cannot be reached. \nColeen ran up almost £2m in legal bills for the case after she sued Becky for libel after her rival claimed she was selling stories about her and her family to the media.\nDuring Coleen's stint on I'm A Celeb last year Coleen spoke about the trial despite rival Rebekah 'vowing to call in the lawyers' if she spoke about it in the jungle.\nColeen insisted the trial 'wasn't a joke to her' as she confided in her campmates GK Barry, Jane Moore and Dean McCullough.\n\nBecky registered the catchy term for trademark in the UK in August 2022 through the company London Entertainment Inc Ltd which made two applications on her behalf\n\nBut accounts filed this week for Wagatha Christie International Ltd – of which Becky is the sole director – show the outfit is currently 'dormant' with assets of £100 (Coleen seen arriving at court)\nWagatha Christie is the popular name given to Coleen and Rebekah's £1.8 million court case, which culminated in 2022.\nIt began when Coleen put a widely shared post on Instagram which accused Rebekah of leaking 'false stories' about her private life to the press.\n\nEXCLUSIVE Rebekah Vardy is dealt another blow following her Wagatha Christie legal defeat as she takes aim at Coleen Rooney during her I'm A Celeb stint \nRebekah denied the allegations and sued Coleen for libel, but the case – dubbed the Wagatha Christie trial – fell in Coleen's favour, and left Rebekah liable to pay £1.5 million towards Coleen's legal fees.\nAt the time it was reported that Rebekah was on high alert and was also keen to remind ITV bosses and the show's hosts, Ant and Dec that she owns the trademark to the phrase Wagatha Christie.\nA source told The Sun at the time: 'Becky was absolutely agog to hear Coleen was doing I'm A Celeb and fears a whole new round of allegations about their WAG war.'\n'What's more, she knows Ant and Dec will make her the brunt of their jokes and be desperate to jump on the Wagatha Christie phrase.\n'A very close eye will be kept on everything ITV air.'\nColeen spoke out about the three year ordeal on the Stick To Football podcast by SkyBet recently and admitted it caused her family life and marriage to husband Wayne to become 'strained'. \nShe said: 'It was the lowest I'd say I've ever been. I had no control over it and that was hard.\n'I knew what I was saying was right, but the fact that someone else took me to court and I had to prove it and say it was what it was was tough. \n'It was a long period of time and I couldn't get away from it. Every day, I'd wake up and think 'Coleen, just get on with your day', but it kept creeping back in all the time.' \n\nLast November MailOnline revealed that Rebekah had lost a challenge from upmarket linen firm Christy which blocked her from flogging Wagatha Christie-themed towels and sheets\nColeen went on to say she would become 'snappy' and dread Fridays because she would have to face lengthy phone calls with lawyers. \nShe added: 'I felt like I wasn't myself, I was snappy, and every Friday the lawyers rang me – the other team try and ruin your weekend by calling at the last point on Friday. \n'They'd tell me what's going on and then to try and have a nice weekend. I'd go away and start overthinking things, and start looking for things that he's asking for. \n'It got to 2am, Wayne would be waiting on the couch to watch something and eventually say 'I'm going to bed'. \n'It put a strain on family life, friends. I wasn't sociable and it stripped me.' \nRebekah VardyColeen Rooney\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nRebekah Vardy humiliated as her 'Wagatha Christie' business fails to make any profit after she tried to cash in on libel case against Coleen Rooney\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nDelighted parents!

The mission, which was intended to last eight days, has now lasted more than eight months.\n\nExtending beyond Musk’s remit as head of the non-governmental Department of Government Efficiency tasked with cutting $1 trillion from the federal budget, Trump called on his First Buddy to bring Williams and Wilmore back from the thermosphere.\n\n“I have just asked Elon Musk and @SpaceX to ‘go get’ the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration,” he wrote on Truth Social late on Tuesday, taking a swipe at his predecessor. \n\nHe continued: “They have been waiting for many months on @Space Station. Elon will soon be on his way. Hopefully, all will be safe. Good luck Elon!!!” \n\nHours before Trump broadcast his request, Musk publicly accepted the challenge. \n\n“The @POTUS has asked @SpaceX to bring home the 2 astronauts stranded on the @Space_Station as soon as possible,” the billionaire wrote on X. “We will do so. Terrible that the Biden administration left them there so long.”\n\nResponding to a comment that the Biden Administration hated Musk more than they wanted to rescue the astronauts, the MAGA loyalist replied, “True”. \n\nThough it wasn't immediately clear what the new timeline was, a SpaceX Crew-9 Dragon was originally planned to retrieve the astronauts in February, before it was moved to “no earlier than late March 2025,” NASA said last month. \n\nA previous SpaceX rescue mission faced problems, causing Musk’s company to temporarily ground its Falcon 9 rockets in September.\n\nMusk has been especially close with the president ever since endorsing the GOP candidate in July, after the first attempt on Trump’s life during a Pennsylvania rally. \n\nThe Silicon Valley stalwart spent over $250m on political donations to help Trump retake the White House last week, primarily through donations to his super-political action committee, America PAC. \n\nHe continued to cozy up to the president at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, staying in a $ 2000-per-week cottage on its grounds ever since Trump defeated former Vice President Kamala Harris at the ballot box in November.","summary":"SpaceX CEO says he will return Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore to Earth ‘as soon as possible’","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-musk-nasa-astronauts-biden-spacex-b2688578.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/12/14/23/2024-12-13T110055Z_1661596260_RC2L8BA7WO62_RTRMADP_3_USA-TRUMP-TESLA-AUTONOMOUS.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/W1Jwfqxp-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-29 16:29:19","author":"James Liddell","authors":["James Liddell"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.272},{"id":285200444,"title":"‘Remarkably poor judgment’: Wall Street Journal takes a critical eye to start of Trump’s 2nd term","text":"Amid all of the enthusiasm in conservative media for President Donald Trump’s first week back in office, the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal has notably applied some brakes.\n\nThe Journal has editorialized against Trump’s pardons of Jan. 6 rioters, called presidential appointee Robert F.

It’s no more complicated than that.”\n\nThe Journal’s editorials show they are fulfilling a role as thoughtful opinion journalists and not simply advocates, said Tom Rosenstiel, a University of Maryland professor and co-author of “The Elements of Journalism” with Bill Kovach.\n\nIn that book, “we make the point — how do you define what is the difference between pure advocacy and opinion journalism?

It’s like the jungle exploding in a fireball in ‘Apocalypse Now.’ We love the smell of napalm in the morning. It smells like victory.”\n\nOn Foxnews.com, conservative columnist Hugh Hewitt said Trump had a near-perfect first week, with the only exception being the decision on security for the former presidential aides. “Trump did the governing equivalent of batting 1.000 or hitting 10 for 10 from behind the arc in the NBA,” Hewitt wrote.\n\nIn two noted liberal editorial pages, The New York Times has not commented institutionally on Trump’s early moves but wrote before his inauguration that people should not be intimidated by him. The Washington Post has called Kennedy unqualified, suggested Trump revisit plans to fire inspector generals and said the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization was a mistake. It criticized pardons by Trump — and by predecessor Joe Biden. \n\nTuesday was also a day of celebration for many in the conservative media who felt welcome in the White House for press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s first briefing.

I was certain it would do so after getting completely hammered in the last election.\n\nBut I was wrong. The Democratic Party seems determined to continue its headlong march into the oblivion of identity politics.\n\nThe straw that made the camel leave the party came in the form of the Democratic reaction to H.R. 28, Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act of 2025. \n\nThis bill prohibits recipients of federal funds from including males in athletic programs that are designated for females. It’s intended to ensure the safety of and fairness for women and girls in sports.\n\nPresident Joe Biden was all in on the matter of transgender rights, declaring it the “civil rights issue of our time.” Indeed, Biden quite remarkably invited Dylan Mulvaney, an adult male who identifies as a woman and sometimes as a prepubescent girl, to the White House to discuss transgender rights.\n\nPolls indicated during the campaign that swing voters were turning away from Kamala Harris and toward Donald Trump as a result of the latter’s ads focused on Harris’ past support for transgender rights and her backing of taxpayer-funded gender-transition surgery for inmates. Harris decided to stay largely silent for the most part though her campaign did note the inmate gender-transition-surgery policy existed when Trump was president.\n\nAlthough I was puzzled about Harris’ silence, I was encouraged she did not take to the campaign soapbox to express the level of support Biden had. That was a marked contrast.\n\nI was cautiously optimistic that in light of the growing consensus about how “gender-affirming medicine” harms children perhaps we were starting to see the back of this rather peculiar phenomenon. I thought her failure to be explicit about any light between her and Biden on the issue was just not wanting to alienate those who took her boss’ position given it was predicted to be a close election.\n\nBut the Dems lost and the transgender issue played a role in that loss. I was then certain the Democrats would see the need to be explicit in reassuring people they were at least backing off the Biden level of support for trans rights and people would not be cast into reactionary hell for not using preferred pronouns.\n\nBoy, was I wrong.\n\nThe Protection of Women and Girls in Sports Act offered the Dems an excellent opportunity to take a baby step away from Biden’s support. Who could doubt that it’s unfair and unsafe for women and girls to have to play competitive sports with men and boys?\n\nThe answer: The Democrats could. Their reaction to the bill demonstrated they’re as stuck as ever in the thrall of gender ideology, which holds a man can self-identify as a woman based simply on a feeling that requires the rest of us to ignore his biological sex as recognized — not “assigned” — at birth.\n\nDemocrat after Democrat got up and attacked H.R. 28 as a blatant attack on trans-identified persons. And it wasn’t just members of the Squad; it was people like Hakeem Jeffries and Jerry Nadler. \n\nThe Dems’ main claim: H.R. 28 is a “predator empowerment” act. Keeping boys off girls’ sports teams would require that children and adolescents have predatory genital inspections.\n\nWe have had separate teams for boys and for girls for ages, and I do not recall anyone ever claiming that required any predatory inspections to see if those who claimed to be boys are boys and those who claimed to be girls are girls. \n\nBut now, keeping boys off girls’ teams is going to require genital inspections and “empower predators”? This is absurd. No one is going to have a problem distinguishing boys from girls, and if there is any issue, school records on sex or birth certificates can be consulted.\n\nWhen I first saw video clips of Dems’ making these accusations on the House floor, I thought they must have been generated by artificial intelligence because they appeared so real. But they appeared real because they were real. \n\nAnd these accusations reflected a point the trans community makes often: Anyone who opposes trans ideology has an unhealthy obsession with genitals. In any event, the Democratic position on H.R. 28 is obscenely unfair to women and girls in addition to being unhinged — and required a response. I gave mine.\n\nI have discussed my views on transgender rights at length in academic journals. My bottom line is that of a liberal pluralist. We should not discriminate against trans-identified individuals in matters of housing, education, employment, etc. An employee who is a good employee and deserves a promotion should not be denied that promotion because he believes he is a woman any more than an employee who is Catholic should be denied the promotion because he believes priests engage in transubstantiation and turn bread and wine into the body of Jesus.\n\nBoth the Catholic and the trans-identified person can choose to believe as they wish. Both can present themselves in a way that reflects their beliefs. But neither can compel us to accept their metaphysical beliefs. \n\nThe Catholic cannot require that we accept transubstantiation, and the trans-identified person cannot require that we accept that sex exists on a spectrum, sex is not binary or sex can be changed. The Catholic cannot cause the ceremony of transubstantiation to be celebrated in my home over my objection, and trans-identified males cannot demand to use woman’s toilets, changing rooms, shower facilities, rape crisis centers, etc. and should not be placed in women’s prisons or play on women’s/girls’ sports teams.\n\nThe argument we ought not to discriminate against trans-identified persons but cannot be compelled to act as though we accept as true their metaphysical beliefs reflects the liberal pluralism that is the foundation of Western political thought. \n\nBut as far as the Democrats are concerned, anything less than the full and unquestioning acceptance of those beliefs — which is analogous to being forced to accept religious or spiritual beliefs — makes us “transphobic” and “bigots” and opens us to the accusation we “empower predators.”\n\nAuthor J.K. Rowling said in 2019 that people should live, look and love as they chose, but a woman should not lose her job because she refused to recognize that a man who identifies as a woman is a woman. The attacks on Rowling, and accusations of “transphobia,” have been nonstop and serious. Rowling, who had been a supporter of the UK Labour Party, withdrew her backing because Labour has a position on this issue similar to Democrats’. \n\nThis is where “progressive” parties are driving their supporters.\n\nSo I am no longer a Democrat. But I am not a Republican either. I sincerely applaud President Trump’s signing of an executive order critical of gender ideology as I do Rep. Nancy Mace’s efforts leading the charge to keep males out of Capitol toilets.\n\nBut I am concerned about any response that represents a general rejection of gender nonconformity and is not focused on women’s rights exclusively. I believe men and women should look, live, and love as they choose as long as others are not required to participate. I don’t want to see gay marriage undone. \n\nBut I don’t want males — however they identify — in women’s private/intimate spaces. I don’t want people to be compelled to use “preferred pronouns” or otherwise forced to speak as though they agree with trans ideology. And I think “gender-affirming treatment” for children should be prohibited.\n\nThe Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade, and choice is, in my view, essential to women’s rights. I clerked for the late Justice Sandra Day O’Connor back in 1982-83, the term she, a Republican appointed by Ronald Reagan, formulated her approach to abortion regulation in a concurrence and dissent the court eventually adopted in 1992. O’Connor’s approach allowed states to regulate abortion as long as they did not impose an “undue burden” on choice. That test provided a workable framework for dealing with abortion. That’s all gone now. Choice is no longer a woman’s constitutional right.\n\nI am not sure where I fit. But I certainly do not think I am alone.\n\nGary L.

Wade to victory, and not without reason. Polling consistently showed that more than half of Americans disapproved of the ruling. And yet, even though Kamala Harris and Tim Walz made abortion rights a centerpiece of their campaign, they lost ground among women.\n\nMost analysts blame the economy for that, but the party’s central emphasis on abortion rights probably made it more difficult for voters to identify Harris with her economic agenda. Nearly eight in 10 voters who named the economy as their top issue voted for Donald Trump, while only 23% of voters named abortion as one of their top three issues.\n\nThe problem, however, wasn’t just one of emphasis. Tone mattered, too. Over the past decade, the party’s rhetoric on abortion has grown more divisive, often taking an accusatory form. Those who wish to ban or restrict it are trying to “control women’s bodies” because they “don’t trust women,” since they’re “weird.”\n\nAlthough the end of Roe has understandably heightened passions on the issue, Democrats would benefit politically by remembering who didn’t make those kinds of accusations: the last three Democrats to win the presidency.\n\nJoe Biden mostly avoided the issue in 2020, not even mentioning it in his convention speech. Bill Clinton memorably spoke about wanting to ensure that abortion was “safe, legal and rare” — a phrase no longer tolerated by party activists, because of the word “rare.” And Barack Obama, who likewise strongly supported abortion rights, took pains to respect opposing views.\n\nIn a 2009 speech at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, Obama told the story of getting an email from a pro-life doctor who wanted to vote for him — but wouldn’t, because Obama’s campaign website mentioned “right-wing ideologues who want to take away a woman’s right to choose.”\n\nThe doctor did not ask Obama to change his view on abortion, only to speak about it “in fair-minded words.” Obama, who directed his staff to change the language on the website and wrote a thank you note to the doctor, urged each side of the debate to make its case respectfully, “without reducing those with differing views to caricature,” and to find common ground on reducing unintended pregnancies, increasing adoptions and improving maternal care.\n\nObama’s approach to abortion — magnanimous and humble, inclusive and unifying — helped him become the first Democrat since 1964 to win Indiana. But since then, Democrats have effectively disqualified those who call themselves pro-life from winning party nominations, even though in most red districts, they offer the best chance to win over not only Republicans, but Democrats, too. About one in four moderate or conservative Democrats, or independents who lean Democrat, believe that abortion should be illegal in most or all cases.\n\n“Our party sends the wrong message when it has any kind of litmus test: abortion, guns, health care,” former Indiana Congressman Tim Roemer told me last fall, during an RV trip that brought me through his old district. (I interned in Roemer’s office as a student at Notre Dame.)\n\n“Democrats do a disservice to themselves if they say, ‘If you’re not with us on a particular issue, you’re not a Democrat,’” he said. “We’ve always been a party with a big tent and diversity.”\n\nOr at least, it was when Democrats were winning national elections.\n\nOn Thursday, Democrats for Life participated in the annual March For Life in Washington, D.C., but no Democratic members of Congress spoke at the group’s breakfast. Its executive director, Kristen Day, is running for vice-chair of the Democratic National Committee, but no delegates have endorsed her candidacy. The outgoing chair of the Democratic National Committee, Jaime Harrison, refused even to meet with the group, Day told me — the first party chair to do so.\n\n“People want to be listened to and have their views heard,” said Day. “I represent the people who don’t have a 100% DNC scorecard, but we still want to be part of the party because there’s a lot we agree with — on paid parental leave, the child tax credit” and other pro-family issues.\n\nWithout listening to these dissenting voices, the Democratic Party seems unable to recognize — or countenance — that many of them favor middle-ground positions. (Democrats for Life has supported the type of laws that prevail in much of Europe, including legal abortion through a pregnancy’s first 20 weeks.) And the party seems unable to recognize — or countenance — that a big tent approach on abortion would help it reclaim areas that have gone from blue to red. In 2024, Democrats for Life’s political action committee endorsed 39 candidates; 37 of them won.\n\nAs Democrats wander the wilderness, they pine for candidates with Obama’s political talents. To have a chance to win the districts and states he did, they should start by embracing his spirit — and giving Day’s candidacy for DNC vice-chair a fair-minded hearing.\n\nFrank Barry is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist and member of the editorial board covering national affairs.

In the front row of the Capitol rotunda, a who’s who of tech billionaires — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Musk himself — lined up to cheer in the new commander-in-chief.\n\n Also showing their support, seated a bit farther back, were Apple CEO Tim Cook, Sam Altman of OpenAI and TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew (later on Jan. 20, Trump issued an executive order delaying a federal ban on the Chinese-owned social media platform).\n\n “Big Tech billionaires have a front row seat at Trump’s inauguration. They have even better seats than Trump’s own cabinet picks. That says it all,” noted Massachusetts Sen. Elisabeth Warren on Musk’s X, suggesting we were watching what Joe Biden, in his final Oval Office speech on Jan. 15, had warned of: “An oligarchy” of the “tech industrial complex” whose “extreme wealth, power, and influence … threatens our entire democracy.”\n\n Talk of a tech oligarchy running the entire U.S. economy may be overblown, even if it may not feel that way at the moment. The combined economic might of the Bezos/Zuckerberg/Musk empires account for less than 2 percent of total American GDP, per a tally from The Economist. Add in Apple and Alphabet, and that rises to 3.1 percent — hardly a controlling share. When it comes to Big Media’s battle with tech for influence, however, it’s hard to be so sanguine. In the eight years since Trump first swore to “protect and defend the Constitution of the United States,” the strength and reach of legacy outlets has fallen while the power of platforms has surged in comparison.\n\n “In the U.S. and in Europe, too, we have allowed an acute concentration of control over the media infrastructure to evolve,” says Johnny Ryan, director of Enforce, a civil liberties group based in Ireland. “Because of that error, we have allowed the emergence of oligarchs who have an enormous influence in how we all view the world, because they decide what our feeds look like. And they are now, it appears, servants of the incoming administration.”\n\n Many of the same tech moguls crowding the rotunda, once vocal critics of Trump, are now keen to toe the MAGA line, hoping to shore up government contracts, benefit from a low-tax, low-regulation regime, and avoid being targeted by Trump for punishment. Over the course of a few days, Zuckerberg shelved Meta’s once-lauded fact-checking program; named prominent Republican Joel Kaplan chief global affairs officer, replacing liberal-leaning British ex-politico Nick Clegg; promoted UFC boss and Trump whisperer Dana White to Meta’s board; and scrapped DEI initiatives so despised by the conservative faithful. Bezos’ Washington Post robustly held Trump’s feet to the fire during his first term, cataloging all 30,573 of the false or misleading claims he made during his presidency, then shied away from a presidential endorsement of Kamala Harris at the last minute of the campaign. \n\n What’s left of the legacy media appears cowed by economic uncertainty — revenue slumps and accompanying job cuts mean fewer resources to throw at the resistance fight — and by years of intimation by Trump and his followers. In December, instead of fighting, ABC News opted to quickly settle a defamation lawsuit brought by Trump over anchor George Stephanopoulos’ on-air assertion that the president-elect had been found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. ABC agreed to pay $15 million toward Trump’s yet-to-be-built presidential library and cover Trump’s legal costs, supposedly another $1 million. Earlier this month, in a separate defamation case, CNN was ordered to pay $5 million for defaming a private security contractor in a five-minute segment that ran on the network in 2021. The CNN case did not involve Trump but is a further indication of how public opinion has turned sharply against mainstream news organizations, just as financial constraints have made it harder for outlets to fend off lawsuits.\n\n A bipartisan piece of legislation, the Protect Reporters From Exploitative State Spying Act, or PRESS Act, would have expanded press protections against government spying and the seizure of reporting materials, making it harder for a vengeful executive branch to crack down on reporting it doesn’t agree with. It passed the House unanimously but, after Trump urged Republicans in Congress to “kill” it, was DOA on the Senate floor in December.\n\n Then there’s the FCC, now headed by Trump ally Brendan Carr. In his first week as FCC chair, Carr has revived complaints against ABC, NBC and CBS, again singing from Trump’s hymn book, alleging liberal bias at the national networks. The complaints — one accusing NBC of violating federal fairness rules by featuring Harris in an SNL sketch four days before the election, one concerning ABC News’ handling of the September Trump-Harris debate, and one involving a CBS edit of a Harris interview for 60 Minutes — were all dismissed by former Democratic FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel. (NBC tried to blunt Trump’s fury over Harris’ SNL appearance by giving him free airtime during a NASCAR race to talk to voters.) Rosenworcel also dismissed a fourth complaint, filed against Fox Corp’s Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan, which argued, that after Fox News spread lies about the use of Dominion Voting Systems machines to “steal” the 2020 election for Biden, the Murdochs lacked the moral character needed to hold broadcast licenses. Carr agreed with that decision and did not revive the Fox complaint.\n\n It’s unclear if the complaints against the networks will move forward and, despite his saber-rattling during the campaign, if Trump would even be able to weaponize the FCC to revoke licenses from broadcasters that displease him. The fear of retribution alone, however, may be enough to silence Trump’s critics. In November, Trump filed a $10 billion lawsuit against CBS claiming “unlawful acts of election and voter interference” in its editing of Harris’ 60 Minutes clip. Whatever the merits of the suit — legal experts have called it “frivolous and dangerous” — for CBS parent, Paramount, which is seeking federal approval for its $8 billion takeover by David Ellison’s Skydance Media, it might be less hassle to settle than to fight and risk a Trump government blocking the merger. (On Trump’s first full day in office, David’s father, Larry Ellison, joined the president to unveil a $500 billion AI initiative, sparking speculation about how the elder Ellison could smooth things over for his son’s media deal.) \n\n More worrying still, for those concerned about a Trump-Big Tech alliance, is the lack of legal guardrails governing social media in the U.S. America is still largely working off Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, which gives owners broad legal immunity from what goes up on their platforms.\n\n Barring strong political opposition within the U.S., the best hope for resistance to the broligarchs could come from Europe. Over the past decade, the European Union has been active in setting up a legislative framework of laws designed to regulate and control online platforms that has given even Musk and Zuckerberg some pause with how they handle data. That legislative framework is an acronymic forest of laws including the Digital Services Act (DSA), the Digital Markets Act (DMA), the General Data Protection Regulation, and the Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMSD).\n\n “Europe has the most developed approach to platform regulation,” says Lucas Graves, a professor of media and communication at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. “What’s not clear is if Europe has the political will to enforce the existing rules, especially given the rise of the same sort of Trumpist sentiments across much of the E.U.”\n\n This story first appeared in the Jan. 29 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

He knew, as even the young children did, that Isis did not have jets to launch airstrikes. It was such an absurd question that he chose not to translate it because he didn’t want to upset the girls, the eldest of whom was 12.\n\n“From that point on, I’m sorry to say I was inaccurate in my translations of anything she said,” Moustafa told The Independent. “It was more like: How do I get these girls away from this devil?”\n\nEven before Gabbard left the Democratic Party, ingratiated herself with Donald Trump and secured his nomination to become director of National Intelligence, she was known as a prolific peddler of Russian propaganda.\n\nIn almost every foreign conflict in which Russia had a hand, Gabbard backed Moscow and railed against the US. Her past promotion of Kremlin propaganda has provoked significant opposition on both sides of the aisle to her nomination.\n\nHer journey from anti-war Democrat to Moscow-friendly Maga warrior began in Syria. The devastating conflict was sparked by pro-democracy uprisings in 2011, which were brutally crushed by the Assad regime. It descended into a complex web of factions that drew extremist Islamists from around the world and global powers into the fray.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group with a network of sources on the ground, documented the deaths of 503,064 people by March 2023. It said at least 162,390 civilians had died in that same time, with the Syrian government and its allies responsible for 139,609 of those deaths.\n\nBut Gabbard, a veteran of the Iraq War, viewed it all as a “regime-change war” fueled by the West and aimed at removing the dictator from power. She saw Assad – and Russia, when it entered the conflict – as legitimate defenders of the state against an extremist uprising.\n\nIn 2015, when Russia entered the Syrian war on the side of the dictator Assad, Gabbard expressed support for the move, even as the civilian toll from Moscow’s devastating airstrikes grew into the thousands.\n\n“Al-Qaeda attacked us on 9/11 and must be defeated. Obama won’t bomb them in Syria. Putin did. #neverforget911,” she wrote on Twitter.\n\nIt was precisely because of her support for Assad and Russia’s war that Moustafa was keen for her to attend the congressional delegation to southern Turkey to meet the victims of the conflict.\n\n“From experience, everyone that we bring over to the border, and they see the victims, they always come back with a realistic view of what’s happening and who is behind the mass displacement and killing and atrocities and so on, and so that was the objective,” he said. “What was shocking was her lack of empathy. She’ll sacrifice the facts, even when it came to little girls in front of her telling her they got bombed by a plane – it didn’t matter.”\n\nCharles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute who testified twice on Syria to the House Foreign Affairs Committee when Gabbard was a member, spent years debunking her various conspiracy theories about the war.\n\n“Her consistent denial of the Syrian regime’s crimes is so wildly fringe that her potential appointment as DNI is genuinely alarming,” he told The Independent.\n\nLister said her views “appear to be driven by a strange fusion of America First isolationism and a belief in the value of autocratic and secular leaders in confronting extremism.”\n\nThey included a suggestion that Syrian rebels staged a false-flag chemical weapons attack against their supporters to provoke Western intervention against Assad — something the US intelligence agencies she will soon lead had concluded was false. She declined to call Assad a war criminal when pressed, despite masses of evidence, and used a video of Syrian government bombings to criticize US involvement in the war.\n\n“Her descriptions of the crisis in Syria read like they were composed in Assad’s personal office, or in Tehran or Moscow – not Washington,” Lister added.\n\nGabbard was not swayed by meeting the victims of Assad’s airstrikes in 2015. In fact, two years later, she went to Damascus to meet the Syrian president in person and came away even more convinced of her opinions.\n\nThe congresswoman said her visit to meet Assad – the first by a sitting US lawmaker since the conflict began – was aimed at bringing an end to the war.\n\n“I felt it’s important that if we profess to truly care about the Syrian people, about their suffering, then we’ve got to be able to meet with anyone that we need to if there is a possibility that we could achieve peace,” she told CNN at the time.\n\nGabbard was forced to defend her embrace of Assad and other dictators during her 2020 run for the Democratic presidential nomination. During the Democratic primary debate, she clashed with Kamala Harris, who accused her of being “an apologist for an individual – Assad – who has murdered the people of his country like cockroaches.”\n\n“She has embraced and been an apologist for him in a way that she refuses to call him a war criminal. I can only take what she says and her opinion so seriously and so I’m prepared to move on,” added Harris, who would subsequently drop out of the race and later be selected as Joe Biden’s running mate.\n\nWhen Russia invaded Ukraine, Gabbard again defended Russian aggression.\n\n“This war and suffering could have easily been avoided if Biden Admin/Nato had simply acknowledged Russia’s legitimate security concerns,” she posted on Twitter in 2022.\n\nGabbard appeared to fall for various conspiracy theories about the conflict that were promoted by Russia, as she had done in Syria. One of those conspiracy theories was a Russian claim about the existence of dozens of US-funded biolabs in Ukraine that were supposedly producing deadly pathogens.\n\nShe later walked back on those remarks, suggesting that there might have been some “miscommunication and misunderstanding.”\n\nGabbard’s frequent echoing of Kremlin talking points has earned her praise in Russian state media. Indeed, an article published on 15 November in the Russian-state controlled outlet RIA Novosti went so far as to call Gabbard a “superwoman.”\n\nThe possibility that Trump would tap someone with Gabbard’s history to be America’s top intelligence official shouldn’t be a surprise to anyone who followed the president-elect’s first four years in the White House.\n\nDuring his 2018 summit with President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki, the then-president was asked if he believed the US intelligence community’s assessment, which stated that Russia had interfered in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf. \n\nThat assessment was based on analysis of what was determined to have been state-sponsored campaigns of fake social media posts and ersatz news sites to spread false stories about his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, as well as cyberattacks targeting the Democratic National Committee and prominent operatives associated with the Clinton campaign.\n\nBut Trump, who’d just spent several hours in a closed-door meeting with Putin, stunned the assembled press and the entire world by declaring that he trusted the Russian leader’s word over that of his own advisers.\n\n​​\"President Putin says it’s not Russia. I don’t see any reason why it would be,\" he replied.\n\nTrump would go on to repeatedly clash with his own intelligence appointees during the remainder of his term. He sacked his first DNI, former Indiana senator Dan Coats, after Coats repeatedly declined to back away from the government’s assessment of what Russia had done during the 2016 presidential race.\n\nLarry Pfeiffer, the director of George Mason University’s Hayden Center for Intelligence, Policy, and International Security, said Gabbard’s apparent susceptibility to foreign disinformation and her affinity for strongmen will give pause to American allies with whom the US routinely shares intelligence on common threats.\n\nIntelligence services, he explained, are notoriously territorial and tight-lipped on sources and methods – particularly when it comes to so-called human intelligence, or Humint, which refers to information collected by and from spies and sources within hostile governments.\n\nPfeiffer said foreign allies are likely already concerned about how a second Trump administration will handle intelligence, given the president-elect’s record. He also predicted that Gabbard’s confirmation as DNI would cause even more problems among skittish partners.\n\n“I think they wouldn’t feel like they’ve got an American confidant that they can deal with on a mature level,” he said. “I can guarantee you that the foreign intelligence services of Europe, including the Brits, are all having little side conversations right now about … what is this going to mean, and how are we going to operate, and what are we going to do now.”\n\nThe former US intelligence veteran also said Gabbard’s record of spreading foreign talking points calls into question whether she will be able to carry out the DNI’s important responsibility of briefing the president on threats to the nation.\n\nHe told The Independent: “Somebody like Tulsi Gabbard, you look at her long history of statements that seem to come out of the Kremlin’s notebook, her propensity to be influenced by their viewpoint – [it] raises questions as to whether she has the ability to present the intel community’s perspective as it is, or is she going to be one who’s going to want to discount it, influence it, color and change it, or ignore it and just present her own view?\n\n“I think it also raises questions of judgement. You know, here’s an individual who seems very prone to misinformation, prone to conspiracy theory. That should worry anybody who’s worried about America’s national security,” he added.\n\nTrump’s selection of the former Hawaii congresswoman could be a problem for the senators tasked with confirming her, on several different levels. For one, the position is unique among cabinet agencies in that there are strict requirements for who can serve in the director’s role.\n\nThe text of the 2004 law which established the Office of the Director of National Intelligence in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks on New York and Washington and the intelligence community’s failures leading up to the US invasion of Iraq, specifically states that any person who serves in the DNI job “shall have extensive national security expertise.”\n\nThe first person to serve as DNI, John Negroponte, was a widely respected foreign service veteran who had served as US ambassador to Iraq, Mexico, Honduras and the Philippines, as the country’s ambassador to the United Nations, and as a deputy national security adviser during the Reagan administration. The next three people to hold the office were flag-rank military officers with significant intelligence experience.\n\nPfeiffer, a US intelligence veteran of three decades’ standing who once ran the White House Situation Room and served as chief of staff to then-CIA director General Michael Hayden, told The Independent that Gabbard’s experience in the House and her military service, while admirable, do not match the standards envisioned by the authors of the 2004 law which established the office.\n\n“That’s national security experience … but she was a freaking military cop … operating at a largely tactical level, not that strategic, long-term national security perspective that one would expect,” he said.\n\nGabbard may have left the Syrian conflict behind, but Moustafa still works with its victims every day. And he believes the connection between her views on Syria and Ukraine is clear.\n\n“What happened in Syria is what allowed the Russians to feel that they could do the very same in Ukraine,” he said.\n\n“And what she is doing with Ukraine shows that it goes beyond her maybe misunderstanding one conflict. She is, hook, line and sinker, a Russian puppet.”","summary":"One expert says her views are ‘so wildly fringe that her potential appointment as DNI is genuinely alarming’, Richard Hall and Andrew Feinberg write","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/tulsi-gabbard-russian-connection-dni-trump-syria-b2688466.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2020/11/27/18/GettyImages-1204959501.jpg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/Zqeo31c5-OhrQWqOm.mp4","publish_date":"2025-01-29 14:42:45","author":"Richard Hall","authors":["Richard Hall"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.136},{"id":285163992,"title":"Strictly's Janette Manrara breaks her social media silence after Wynne Evans made an 'inappropriate sexual comment about her'","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jan 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrincess Beatrice gives birth to her second daughter with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi as adorable name is revealed\n\nFemale hospital worker, 51, is charged with plot to kidnap, rape and murder a girl under 13\n\nLove Island winner is jailed for six weeks after his hulking out-of-control Cane Corso dog attacked a man\n\nSadiq Khan leads Labour backlash as Rachel Reeves says Heathrow third runway MUST happen to help revive stalling economy - with top donor and MPs condemning the move\n\nJennifer Aniston's menopause-busting workout has been hailed by top experts... but can it REALLY get my 54-year-old body into the same shape as hers?

[sic]' \nJanette's post comes after The Mail On Sunday revealed last week that she had been the subject of a vile joke. \nWynne – the tenor known for the Go Compare ads and a BBC radio presenter – was recorded crudely suggesting a three-way sex session with presenter Janette, using the hugely demeaning term 'spit roast'. \nIn the MoS film, Wynne stands in the middle of a line-up of 20 celebrities and dancers as Janette, who hosts the TV spin-off Strictly Come Dancing: It Takes Two, is summoned to join them. As she approaches, Wynne warns her with a grin: 'Not too close to Jamie [Borthwick]!'\nHe then pulls a suggestive face at the actor, behind Janette's back, as she moves between them. It is at this point that Wynne makes his disgusting joke at her expense.\nSeconds later, her dancer husband Aljaz Skorjanec, who was standing nearby, asks her: 'Darling, are you OK?' She replies curtly: 'Yep.' \n\nOn Tuesday, Janette revealed she had been enjoying having her mother Maritza come visit from Miami, Florida to help out with her daughter (pictured with husband Aljaz Škorjanec) \n\nJanette (pictured with her mother and brother) said of the visit: 'My heart was full. Mom, I love you, I appreciate you, and I cannot wait to see you again soon'\n\nJanette's mother was quick to comment, telling her daughter to 'keep shining' \n\n Wynne Evans likens himself to a clown with two personalities and says he wants to be a better person \nJanette's spokesperson said the host had been 'unaware of this comment by Wynne' which was audible to our reporter filming with a mobile phone 20 yards away. \nFollowing the widespread revulsion caused by the revelations in the Mail story, Wynne was replaced on his morning radio show on Monday by comedian Robin Morgan, who also stood in for Wynne while he appeared on Strictly last year.\nA source told MailOnline the break was sparked by the furore surrounding his comment, plus the fact he is still mourning his older brother Huw, combined with the physical toll of being on the road.\n'He's had repeated warnings about his behaviour and told to rein it in. He's not been taking it in, in this day and age the BBC have to be seen taking action and safeguard everyone,' an insider has now told The Sun.\n'He's had a tough time with the death of his brother and people should give him some slack, he is going to take this time off to do some self reflection.\n'He has a lot of support from a lot of the backstage dancers. It's been a really sad ending to what has been a really fun tour.'\nThe following day, the Welsh star was rumoured to have been axed from the Strictly live tour. \nLater that day, he confirmed his departure from the tour in a grovelling statement. \n\nWynne was caught on film by The Mail on Sunday making a vile sexual comment about It Takes Two presenter Janette during a photocall to launch the tour \n\nThe Welsh star, famed for playing a portly Italian opera singer in a string of insurance ads for Go Compare, confirmed his departure from the Strictly live tour in a grovelling statement \nHe said: 'I've agreed with the BBC that I’ll take some time out from my radio show and the Strictly Live tour, as well as my other public commitments, to prioritise my wellbeing.\n'I am deeply sorry for the pain my inappropriate actions have caused, and plan to take this time for self-reflection.\n'Apologies to those I won’t get to see at the remaining performances and I’m grateful to my fellow tour gang for all the amazing support they have given me.' \nProfessional dancer Katya Jones, who was partnered with Wynne on Strictly, reposted the message and wrote: 'Let’s show humanity and consideration.' \nShe added that she would miss Wynne in the post to her Instagram Stories.\n\nShare or comment on this article: \nStrictly's Janette Manrara breaks her social media silence after Wynne Evans made an 'inappropriate sexual comment about her'\n\nAdd comment\n\nEnter search term:\n\nPrincess Beatrice gives birth to her second daughter with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi as her adorable name is revealed\n\n'Nervous' Stacey Solomon reveals she's finally able to share huge news with husband Joe Swash\n\nA Place In The Sun viewers call out house hunters for glaring blunder as they get a VERY nasty shock touring properties with a £350k budget\n\nVanessa Feltz's ex Ben Ofoedu breaks his silence on their calamitous split and reveals how he REALLY feels about her: EDEN CONFIDENTIAL\n\nEXCLUSIVETaylor Swift taking a 'step back' from Blake Lively as dramatic legal battle with Justin Baldoni threatens their decade-long friendship\n\nSomething for everyone!

You know that's what it is,” she shouted.\n\nAnti-Trumper Alyssa Farah Griffin eventually spoke up to correct the record on Leavitt’s career path. “I want to be clear, though. It's not her first job. It was her first press believing. She worked in the previous Trump administration,” she said as the rest of the cast tried to speak over her.\n\n “This is the first time she's been -- she may be, but my point is that job would not maybe have been open to her,” Goldberg tried to argue.\n\nGoldberg would go on to whine about Leavitt and the Trump White House expanding access to the White House press pool. She claimed this would lead to “state-run news.” She suggested she would \"feel a lot better\" if there were \"standards people have to meet.\" She also complained that \"there's too much BS out there\" and \" there's no way to control it.\"\n\nThat bellyaching came from the same woman who tried to scare people into voting for Vice President Kamala Harris by falsely claiming Trump was going to break up interracial families and redistribute the white spouse to someone else. She also once insisted that “the Holocaust isn’t about race.”\n\nThe transcript is below.

It's been such a big part of our lives… \n'I love sharing what we do on Instagram, but this is capturing the laughs, tears and the craziness at Pickle Cottage in such a different way. On the actual TV.' \nShe thanked her fans for their support, saying: 'It still feels surreal and I'm so nervous about it, but all your lovely comments have made such a difference. I'll share more about the show when I can [heart emoji].\n'There's honestly not a day that goes by that I'm not grateful for every single one of you... You're just the best mates I could ever ask for. Thank you xxx.'\n\nStacey Solomon told fans she's 'so nervous' as she shared huge news with husband Joe Swash in her personal newsletter \n\nThe Loose Women star, 35, announced earlier this month that the couple, who have been married since 2022, have opened their household to the cameras for the first time\n\nStacey announced earlier this month that the couple, who have been married since 2022, had opened their household to the cameras for the first time. \nAlthough the TV personality is no stranger to sharing glimpses into her personal life online, the new BBC series will invite a camera crew into their space to document just how the celebrity pair balance their busy work schedule with their family life.\nWhen announcing the exciting news, the couple shared a teaser for the upcoming show, showing Stacey and Joe along with their five children in the garden of their impressive £1.2million Essex home.\nThe adorable clip also showed snapshots of their beloved pets Teddy and Peanut, and a gaggle of ducks.\nAccompanied by a heartwarming polaroid snapshot of the family, Stacey captioned the post: 'A new year. A very new adventure. Coming Spring 2025. We've been so nervous and excited to share this. Here is us. All of us. \n'In 2024 we opened up our home and made a series about our lives, family, work and everything in between.'\n'It was a huge leap into the unknown and it's been an absolute whirlwind making it. But last year as a family we decided to say yes to more and do things we'd never done. We have spoken about making a documentary for a long time, lots of you have asked too. So here we go. \n'A journey with us every second of the way. Through the laughter the tears and the craziness... We hope it makes you smile, feel good and hopefully enjoy getting to know us all a little more.'\nFilming for the reality show hasn't been wholly smooth sailing, with Stacey reportedly left in tears after having what looked like a row with Joe in the street back in November.\n\nThe Sort Your Life Out star took to Instagram on New Year's Day to officially announce the news, following reports she and Joe were filming the fly-on-the-wall series\n\nSharing a sweet trailer to promote the series, the clip featured Stacey and Joe's five children playing in the garden of their £1.2 million Essex home\nIn a video obtained by The Sun, the mother-of-five was seen being comforted by her reality TV crew as she attempted to hide her appearance.\nRecognising the famous couple, an onlooker claimed they saw Joe, 42, storming down the road outside Westcliff on Sea train station in Essex while furiously puffing on a vape after the argument.\nThey revealed: 'Joe came out of a building on his own and stormed off down the street, he looked upset and was sitting on some steps for a while.\n'Stacey came out of the building in tears and she looked really emotional, she was hugging someone.'\nThe video showed Stacey embraced in a tight hug before another member of production went to check on Joe.\nIn May, Stacey revealed her dream was to quit TV work entirely to spend time with her five children and explained that she only wanted to take on work that she could do from home.\nBut she gave fans some hope by hinting that she could always be tempted back to TV screens to work on a passion project.\nDiscussing her work on the Glad We Had This Chat podcast, Stacey explained she wanted to spend more time with of her children and has had to reconsider her work commitments.\n\nAlong with the television couple, who married in 2022, their children Zach, 16, Leighton, 12, Rex, five, Rose, three, and Belle, 22 months, will make appearances on the show\n'Each year I have a team meeting with my agent and everyone on the team to say, \"What's your plan, what's your goals, blah, blah, blah\",' she explained.\n'And this year when they asked me my five-year goals, I was like \"I want to be a stay-at-home mum\".\nStacey and Joe will show the 'highs and lowers of family life with a large brood - after revealing they had adopted ducks while building her Pickle Cottage.\nAmid their renovation, Stacey revealed the addition of two ducklings to her family on Instagram in June, as she shared a video of two of her children Rex, five, and Rose, two, cuddling them while she asked fans for name ideas.\nShe wrote: 'Welcome To Pickle Cottage Little Ones. We are so excited to love you & we hope you love living here & being a part of our crazy family.

Pope Francis actually criticized the new U.S. administration the day before it even started, telling an Italian television program on Jan. 19, “If he wants to expel undocumented migrants, it will be a disgrace. This won’t do.” \n\nEarlier on, in September 2024, the Holy Father, referencing Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, said: “Both are against life, be it the one who kicks out migrants, or be it the one who kills babies.” He said Catholics should vote for the “lesser evil,” without saying who that was. Polls show that most Catholics who voted in the presidential election favored President Trump.\n\nIf anything, the heat of the immigration debate has only risen since the Trump administration began less than two weeks ago. Sharp criticism from the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) has been answered in return by pointed rebukes by border czar Tom Homan and Vice President JD Vance, both Catholics. Both sides have Catholic allies and critics joining in, especially in the ever-contentious online space. \n\nFor ordinary Catholics who are not deeply partisan, the contours of the debate can be bewildering. There is, on both sides, a conflation or selective reading of many contending arguments and issues: immigration in general, illegal immigration, the right to asylum, human dignity, law enforcement, national sovereignty and worker’s rights. The Catechism and decades of Catholic teaching, from Pope St. John XXIII’s 1963 encyclical Pacem in Terris to subsequent popes to the USCCB’s 2003 pastoral letter “Strangers No Longer: Together on the Journey of Hope” have been cherry-picked or quoted to buttress one argument or another.\n\nWhat most definitely seems to be missing in the debate, by both sides in the United States, is a recognition that the issue of migration in all its aspects has now become an extremely contentious global issue, for Catholics and non-Catholics. \n\nWithin the past year, we have seen leading Western political leaders — some of them Catholics — turn sharply against immigration, at least rhetorically, in Canada, the United Kingdom, France and Germany. In all of these countries, politicians had at some point been critical of the first Trump administration on this very issue. They changed because popular opinion in these democracies on immigration has shifted, becoming much more hostile. There seems to have been somewhat less fire from bishops’ conferences in those countries in response, compared to the United States. \n\nThe Catholic Church in Italy, of course, has launched some criticism against Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, an anti-immigration hardliner, on the issue since she entered office in 2022, but it all seems rather mild compared to the U.S. version.\n\nIn the Western Hemisphere, the issue of migration seems to become rather more muted or nuanced once the United States or Trump are not part of the argument. Mexico has repatriated thousands of foreigners, including Colombians and Cubans, for years, with little debate. Two states in the Americas — Nicaragua and Cuba — aggressively use forced expulsion or forced exile of their own citizens as a political weapon. Criticism from bishops’ conferences or the Vatican has been relatively muted because both regimes are dictatorships who either openly persecute the Church (Nicaragua) or seek to control it (Cuba).\n\nAnd just as accepting migrants or refugees has become a hot political topic in the West, migration has also become a weapon in hybrid, indirect warfare waged by some nations against their neighbors, not only by exporting unwanted populations but by using migration flows to pressure other countries to extract financial or political benefits. \n\nIn addition to Cuba and Nicaragua, one can point to Algeria, Morocco, Turkey and Belarus as among the most blatant practitioners of this cynical tactic. Profiting from the migrant/refugee racket is not limited to criminal gangs; it includes nation states. \n\nAn interesting example of the complexity of the migrant question is Lebanon. Former President Michel Aoun and his foreign minister at the time, Gebran Bassil, both of them Maronite Catholics, were virulently opposed to Lebanon hosting more than 1.5 million Syrian refugees, the largest number of refugees per capita in the world. While there was some criticism of this stance by liberals and secularists, it was not an issue of contention between the Church and Catholic political leaders because the Church shares some of those concerns — that tiny Lebanon could be overwhelmed by foreigners and that the mostly Muslim Syrian refugee population would never leave and would further damage Lebanon’s already delicate demographic situation. \n\nWhile the situation in Lebanon was driven by war, elsewhere, in South Africa and other relatively wealthier states in the Global South, the challenge is South-South migration. Africans are not only trying to get to Europe or the United States, they also head south or east, to try to enter the fabulously wealthy Arab Gulf states. \n\nIn 2023, Saudi Arabia is alleged to have machine-gunned hundreds if not thousands of Ethiopian refugees trying to enter the kingdom. In South Africa, migrants and refugees could enter but have been the victims of xenophobic outbreaks of vigilante violence by locals. Most asylum-seekers in South Africa (90%) are rejected but allowed to stay by paying bribes. \n\nThe United States is large and powerful and its news circles the globe, and so the seeming confrontation between the Trump administration and the USCCB or Pope Francis over migration dominates headlines and generates fierce controversy. \n\nBut laws and attitudes seem to be hardening worldwide. It is an issue everywhere, with every possible permutation, nuance and cruelty imaginable. We’re just not usually paying so much attention.","summary":"commentary","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/the-heat-on-immigration","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/2025012908010_03d5043f39568ae33ae7cf41b7f72e37ece4434932ec9128cdaf292d705a602b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 14:04:30","author":"Alberto M.

Rowley earlier this month announced that he would not be running for office in the 2025 general election, naming Young as his chosen successor.\n\nPersad-Bissessar criticised Young over his handling of the energy sector, and also called him “race-fluid”.\n\n“Having only spoken of his Chinese heritage up until this point, the country is left to wonder if Stuart was hiding his East Indian roots until it suddenly became beneficial to his political career to announce it. Stuart is the local Kamala Harris—he is race-fluid.

I have also written about how social media can amplify misinformation and hate speech. \n\nSome observers and analysts who follow Trump dismiss his hateful language against immigrants as empty bluster or performance art. \n\nThe implication is that Trump will not act on his most extreme promises and follow through on what he has called “the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.”\n\nIn the first few days of the new Trump administration, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers began raids to detain immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and increased their number of arrests and deportations of immigrants, including those without violent criminal records. \n\nTom Homan, the U.S. border czar, has said that the government’s mass immigration deportation plans – which he said could include raids on schools, churches and other places previously considered havens – is “all for the good of this nation.” \n\nMy hate speech research shows that, as the world has seen to its horror again and again, words that slander and strip people of their voices and humanity are often a first step toward discriminatory and violent policies. At its most extreme, speaking of people as dirty and polluting and saying they lack humanity makes it easier to kill them.\n\nEchoes from the fascist past\n\nThere is nothing new about the hateful political rhetoric that has become common today. \n\nIn the lead-up to and during World War II, fascist leaders in Europe targeted Jews, Roma, gay people and other groups as sources of “social pollution,” as beyond being human, while describing themselves as noble and decent, embodying a pure, uncorrupted nation.\n\nIn 1920, well before the German Nazi Party came to power in 1933, its platform declared that “Only someone of German blood, regardless of faith, can be a citizen.” \n\nViktor Klemperer, a literary scholar who was a close observer of Nazism, wrote in a diary published posthumously in 1995 that the Third Reich’s demonizing language against Jews and other marginalized groups helped create its culture and justify its mass killings. Nazis consequently assumed the mantle of liberators as they killed those whom they saw as corrupting the “pure race,” in accordance with ideas of “racial hygiene.”\n\nThe Nazis murdered more than 12 million people.\n\nThe Nazis’ hateful language was not limited to Europe. Fritz Kuhn, a German Nazi activist, served in the late 1930s and early 1940s as leader of the German American Bund, an organization of ethnic Germans and Nazi sympathizers living in the U.S. He addressed a Nazi rally at Madison Square Garden in New York City in 1939. \n\nKuhn said during his speech that American citizens with American ideals are “determined to protect ourselves, our homes, our wives and children against the slimy conspirators who would change this glorious republic into the inferno of a Bolshevik paradise.” \n\nThe U.S. government stripped Kuhn of his U.S. citizenship in 1943 and deported him to Germany in 1945 because of his pro-Nazi allegiance.\n\nItaly’s far right shifts from words to violence\n\nItaly offers another example of how hateful speech can lead to discriminatory or violent policies. Right-wing politicians and policies have grown more popular and powerful in the past few years in Italy. \n\nIn 2018, Matteo Salvini, then the deputy prime minister who now holds the same position, denounced the Roma people, an ethnic minority. He called for their removal through a “mass cleansing street by street, piazza by piazza, neighborhood by neighborhood.” \n\nThese were not empty words. \n\nSalvini’s call was accompanied by mob violence, mass evictions and demolition of Roma informal camps set up in the streets. The Roma people continue to face discrimination and racial profiling. \n\nSalvini has directed his most virulent language, however, toward the tens of thousands of migrants and asylum seekers, mostly from Africa, who attempt to reach Italy via the Mediterranean Sea. \n\nSalvini has frequently called the arrival of migrants a “flood” or “surge”. This kind of dehumanizing language makes it easier to provoke alarm about an abstract, unwanted mass of people. \n\nThe claims behind Salvini’s alarmism, however, are not borne out by facts. Since the peak of migrant sea crossings, when a few hundred thousand migrants entered Italy from 2014 through 2017, the country’s crime rate has fallen significantly. \n\nSalvini, perhaps more than any other populist leader in the world, has turned his hateful language and use of misinformation into action. Italian authorities under Salvini’s direction have detained ships working to help rescue migrants who are in danger at sea, preventing them from carrying out those rescues.\n\nThis obstruction violates European Union law, which ensures the legal right to help anyone found in distress at sea. \n\nIn September 2024, an Italian prosecutor requested a six-year jail term for Salvini, accusing him of kidnapping 147 migrants by preventing them from landing at a port in Italy for several weeks. \n\nSalvini said he was defending Italian borders by keeping the migrants aboard a Spanish migrant rescue ship. \n\nSalvini was acquitted of kidnapping and dereliction of duty charges in December 2024. \n\nWhat to expect\n\nWe can’t be certain at this point what Trump’s and his supporters’ hateful language against immigrants, minorities and political opponents will yield. \n\nJudging by Italy’s example and other instances, it’s possible that laws will be broken in implementing Trump’s immigration and asylum policies. \n\nA federal judge temporarily halted Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order that told federal agencies to not process identification documents for babies born to parents who are living in the country illegally, among other scenarios. \n\nIt’s not clear how these policies will continue to unfold. What is clear is that words of hate have been used in many times and places as a justification for illegal arrests and, in some cases, as a prelude to state-sanctioned mass violence.","summary":"Hateful language used to demonize particular groups of people had been used long before the era of Donald Trump, including by the Nazis.","url":"https://theconversation.com/aliens-and-animals-language-of-hate-used-by-trump-and-others-can-be-part-of-a-violent-design-245524","image":"https://images.theconversation.com/files/645324/original/file-20250128-15-7czm3k.jpg?ixlib=rb-4.1.0&rect=63%2C252%2C6963%2C3476&q=45&auto=format&w=1356&h=668&fit=crop","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 13:49:19","author":"Professor of Practice in Sociology,Ronald Niezen,University of San Diego","authors":["Professor of Practice in Sociology","Ronald Niezen","University of San Diego"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"AU","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":285136408,"title":"Lady Gaga’s Debut Album Reaches A Major Landmark As She Readies Her Next Chapter","text":"Share to Facebook\n\nShare to Twitter\n\nShare to Linkedin\n\nLady Gaga's The Fame hits 400 weeks on the Billboard 200 as she reveals her new album Mayhem is set ...

The singer revealed the title to be Mayhem, and the set is expected on March 7. As her Little Monsters prepare for another collection of dance-pop anthems, the full-length that started it all for the singer and actress reaches a special milestone.\n\nThe Fame is still present on several Billboard charts this week in America. Gaga’s debut project manages a special performance on the more competitive of the two, where it helps her hit a landmark she’s never seen before.\n\nAs of this week, The Fame has now lived on the Billboard 200 for 400 frames. It’s the Grammy and Oscar winner’s first title to make it to that huge number on the list of the most-consumed albums across the U.S.\n\nAs it hits 400 weeks on the chart, The Fame rises slightly. This time around, the dance-pop pioneering studio effort surges from No. 121 to No. 109.\n\nLuminate reports that in the past tracking frame, The Fame moved another 10,700 equivalent units—a huge sum for an album that was released nearly 17 years ago. Almost 500 of those were pure sales, which is also a notable figure, though it’s clear that streams are largely responsible for the project’s continued presence.\n\nDespite being one of the most successful pop or dance albums of all time, The Fame never reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200. The set stalled in the runner-up rung, though almost all of Gaga’s solo collections have topped the tally in the years since.\n\nMORE FOR YOU\n\nDeepSeek Panic Live Updates: OpenAI And Microsoft Reportedly Probe If DeepSeek Used Their Data For Training\n\nNew iPhone, Android Warning—Do Not Open Any Of These PDFs\n\nWhy Lay’s Potato Chip Recall Was Elevated To FDA’s Deadliest Category\n\nThe Fame produced several singles in the U.S., and all of them became huge hits, helping Gaga break out and prove herself as an immediate powerhouse in the competitive pop space. The set was led by “Just Dance,” which stormed the Hot 100 and reached No. 1. That tune’s follow-up, “Poker Face,” did the same. Fellow promotional cuts “LoveGame” and “Paparazzi” also spent time inside the top 10, and they all remain favorites among millions of listeners to this day.\n\nGaga has never before seen any of her albums reach 400 weeks on the Billboard 200, as The Fame is far and away her longest-running win on the ranking. Only the soundtrack to her remade A Star Is Born film, which credits her and co-star Bradley Cooper, also managed triple-digit turns on the tally, as it held on for 109 frames.\n\nThe Fame nearly returns to No. 1 on another chart as it finds reason to celebrate on the Billboard 200. The title climbs to the runner-up space on the Top Dance Albums ranking, which is specific to that style. Only Charli XCX’s Brat keeps the bestseller from returning to the throne.\n\nFollow me on Twitter. \n\nHugh McIntyre\n\nEditorial Standards\n\nForbes Accolades","summary":"Lady Gaga's The Fame hits 400 weeks on the Billboard 200 as she reveals her new album Mayhem is set to drop on March 7.","url":"https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2025/01/29/lady-gagas-debut-album-reaches-a-major-landmark-as-she-readies-her-next-chapter/","image":"https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/679a2bb2b62004518cd687ea/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 13:45:06","author":"Hugh McIntyre,Senior Contributor","authors":["Hugh McIntyre","Senior Contributor"],"language":"en","category":"entertainment","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.181},{"id":285137504,"title":"What Madonna Has Said About Donald Trump","text":"Pop star Madonna has directed criticism at President Donald Trump's administration days after he was inaugurated into office.The singer, who supported former Vice President Kamala Harris in the recent election cycle, took to X, formerly Twitter, on Tuesday to share her thoughts on the new government, which has been in place since Trump's January 20 swearing in ceremony.\"It's so sad to watch our new Government slowly dismantling all the Freedoms we have been fighting for and WON over the years,\" the \"Express Yourself\" hitmaker wrote, alongside red heart and LGBTQ pride flag emojis. \"Don't give up the Fight!\"As of press time, the post has garnered more than 4 million views. Newsweek has contacted a representative of Trump via email for comment.In the days since he has taken office, Trump has rolled out a plethora of executive orders aimed at transgender people, immigrants and climate change policies, among other things.Madonna's comments about Trump mark the latest in a number of remarks she has made about the returning president. Newsweek has taken a look at what the star has said about the onetime real estate mogul over the years.Dating ClaimsSeveral years before Trump made his first presidential run in 2016, it was claimed that Madonna was one of the \"important, beautiful women\" who had expressed romantic interest in the former host of The Apprentice.The claim was shared with People in 1991 by a \"John Miller,\" who was described as a publicist for Trump. At the time, veteran columnist Cindy Adams listened to a recording of the interview and declared: \"There is no John Miller. That's Donald.\"Madonna addressed the claims in a 2019 interview with The New York Times, telling the newspaper that she recalled speaking with Trump on the phone in Florida.\"I did a Versace campaign with [photographer] Steven Meisel at his house in Palm Beach,\" she said, adding that Trump called her on a number of occasions. \"He kept going: 'Hey, is everything OK? Finding yourself comfortable? Are the beds comfortable? Is everything good? Are you happy?'\"Per The New York Times, Madonna described Trump has having a \"weak character,\" attributing it to his public image as an alpha male.\"They're overcompensating for how insecure they feel—a man who is secure with himself, a human who is secure with themselves, doesn't have to go around bullying people all the time,\" Madonna said.At the time of the interview, Trump was more than halfway through his first term as president. Sharing her political views, Madonna said that some of themes explored on her album Madame X explored her anger over world leaders like Trump \"who seemed to be systematically removing all of our personal freedoms.\"'Heartbreak'In December 2016, weeks after Trump defeated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the presidential election, Madonna shared her feelings on the outcome.\"It felt like someone died,\" she told Billboard. \"It felt like a -combination of the heartbreak and betrayal you feel when someone you love more than anything leaves you, and also a death. I feel that way every morning; I wake up and say, 'Oh, wait, Donald Trump is still the president,' and it wasn't a bad dream that I had.\"\"It feels like women betrayed us,\" Madonna continued. \"The percentage of women who voted for Trump was insanely high.\"Madonna further said that she had \"gotten into major arguments\" with people who had backed Trump, adding: \"In a way, it makes sense that Donald Trump is the president. Because money rules. Not intelligence, not experience, not a moral compass, not the ability to make wise decisions, not the ability to think of the future of the human race.\"Sharing that she planned to take action, the star said: \"I'm trying to figure out my response to Trump. I like the idea that women are marching on Washington, D.C., the day after the inauguration. I want to rain on his parade. I was put on this earth to fight for the underdog and fight against discrimination.\"'Charismatic'On a personal note, Madonna said that while she \"wouldn't call [Trump] a friend or -anything,\" she had \"certainly met him,\" mentioning the Versace campaign she shot at Trump's Mar-a-Lago property in Florida.\"He's a very friendly guy, -charismatic in that -boastful, macho, alpha-male way. I found his political incorrectness amusing,\" she said of Trump. \"Of course, I didn't know he was going to be running for -president 20 years later. People like that exist in the world, I'm OK with it. They just can't be heads of state. I just can't put him and [former President] Barack Obama in the same -sentence, same room, same job description.\"The day after Trump first took office in 2017, Madonna sparked a backlash when she spoke at the anti-Trump Women's March in Washington, D.C.While addressing fellow protesters, the Michigan native said: \"Yes, I'm angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. But I know that this won't change anything.\"In turn, Trump called the singer \"disgusting,\" as an army of his supporters rushed to condemn the remarks.In a since-deleted Instagram post, Madonna said that her comments had been taken \"wildly out of context.\"\"I am not a violent person, I do not promote violence and it's important people hear and understand my speech in its entirety rather than one phrase,\" she wrote.She went on to explain that she had attempted to share that there are two choices when it comes to responding to Trump's election victory—with anger or hope. Madonna shared that she wanted to start a \"revolution of love.\"Leaving TownWhile Madonna didn't name Trump directly, she told Vogue Italia in a 2018 interview that she had left the U.S. for Portugal, as she and her family \"needed a change.\"\"I wanted to get out of America for a minute—as you know, this is not America's finest hour,\" she explained.In the days that followed the 2024 election, Madonna made it clear that she was unhappy with the result. Taking to Instagram, the mother of six shared a photo of a cake emblazoned with the words, \"F*** Trump.\"A follow-up post shared on her Instagram Story alluded to the legal and civil trials that Trump had gone through, while also calling him a \"bigot.\"\"Trying to get my head around why a convicted felon, rapist, bigot was chosen to lead our country because he's good for the economy?\" Madonna wrote, per The Independent.While Trump was last year found liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll, neither verdict involved a finding of rape as defined under New York law.Trump was last year ordered to pay Carroll $5 million after an initial lawsuit. In January, he was ordered to pay her $83.3 million on additional defamation claims. He is appealing both verdicts and has denied any wrongdoing.","summary":"The singer, who this week criticized the Trump administration, has made a number of comments about the president over the years.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/madonna-donald-trump-election-viral-post-2022714","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2576044/madonna-donald-trump.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 13:39:59","author":"Ryan Smith","authors":["Ryan Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.049},{"id":285139810,"title":"Pregnant Jesy Nelson is seen for the first time since announcing she is expecting twins with her boyfriend Zion Foster as she steps out in sweats while picking up snacks","text":"Black Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nBritain's Got Talent\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nWednesday, Jan 29th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPrincess Beatrice gives birth to her second daughter with Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi as adorable name is revealed\n\nLove Island winner is jailed for six weeks after his hulking out-of-control Cane Corso dog attacked a man\n\nRachel Reeves sparks war with Labour eco-zealots as she says Heathrow third runway MUST happen to help revive stalling economy - but Sadiq Khan joins MPs and top donor condemning the move\n\nPrince William says Harry is 'poorly' and 'has been feeling under the weather' - but is it his estranged brother he's talking about?\n\nJennifer Aniston's menopause-busting workout has been hailed by top experts... but can it REALLY get my 54-year-old body into the same shape as hers?

A plurality of 44 percent chose Trump. Only 41 percent chose the news media. Fifteen percent were unsure.\n\nThe internals are mind-blowing and speak to a larger phenomenon…\n\nYoung people aged 18-39 trust Trump over the media by a stunning 13 points, 45 to 32 percent. The only age demographic Trump lost was those aged 40-64, who trust the media more than Trump by five points, 46 to 41 percent. Those aged 65+ trust Trump more than the media by six points, 48 to 42 percent.\n\nSo it’s only the dummies in middle age who have more trust in a news media that have relentlessly lied to them for decades.\n\nHold on to your hats for this next one…\n\nRELATED — Lara Trump: Donald Trump “Thriving” Despite Attacks Against Him\n\nBy a jaw-dropping margin of 20 points, Hispanics trust Trump more than the media, 51 to 31 percent.\n\nOther than black voters, no group has had more media propaganda thrown at them than American Hispanics, and it failed completely. Spanish-language cable news outlets, all these lies about deporting your abuela (unless she’s here illegally, then it’s, Buh-bye, Abuela!)\n\nOnly 52 percent of black voters trust the media more than Trump, while 25 percent of black voters trust Trump more than the media. In normal times, that number would be 92 to 8 percent in favor of the media. The fact that Trump pulls 25 percent trust out of a 90/10 Democrat constituency should have the left overdosing on Ben & Jerry’s in despair.\n\nThat 13-point advantage for Trump with young people is why the regime media are dying. Young voters were once firmly in the pocket of the Democrat Party. In 2020, we are told Trump lost 18-29-year-olds by 25 points to Joe Biden, 61 to 35 percent. In 2024, former Vice President Kamala Harris won only 52 percent of voters aged 18-29, compared to 46 percent for Trump — a six-point Democrat advantage.\n\nBut young people are internet-savvy, which means they are accessing, reading, and absorbing New Media. One of the most extraordinary things that happened between 2020 and 2024 was Tech Titans like Elon Musk and New Media giants like Joe Rogan becoming more and more aware of the legacy media’s lies and basically becoming red-pilled by the reality of the failures of everything the left touches.\n\nEven Cenk Uygur and his Young Turk podcast move a long way towards Team Trump.\n\nSimply put and for all these reasons…\n\nElon Musk Nazi Salute Hoax\nThe All-White Trump Party Hoax\nSpringfield Bomb Threat Hoax\nTrump Called for Liz Cheney to Be Executed Hoax\nViolent Crime Down Under Biden/Harris Hoax\nArlington Cemetery Hoax\nKamala Was Never America’s Border Czar Hoax\nRussia Collusion Hoax\nHands Up, Don’t Shoot Hoax\nJussie Smollett Hoax\nCovington KKKids Hoax\nVery Fine People Hoax\nSeven-Hour Gap Hoax\nRussian Bounties Hoax\nTrump Trashes Troops Hoax\nPolicemen Killed at Mostly Peaceful January 6 Protest Hoax\nRittenhouse Hoax\nEating While Black Hoax\nBorder Agents Whipping Illegals Hoax\nNASCAR Noose Hoax\nGeorgia Jim Crow 2.0 Hoax\nTrump Assaulted Secret Service Agents and Grabbed Steering Wheel of Beast Hoax\nMAGA Assaulted Paul Pelosi Hoax\nCOVID Lab Leak Theory Is Racist Hoax\nHunter Biden’s Laptop Is Russian Disinformation Hoax\nJoe Biden Will Never Ban Gas Stoves Hoax\nCOVID Deaths are Overcounted Is a Conspiracy Theory Hoax\nMass Graves of Native Children in Canada Hoax\nTrump Killed Japanese Koi Fish Hoax\nTrump Told People to Drink Bleach Hoax\nHamas Hospital Hoax\nIf Reelected, Trump Will Execute People Hoax\nThe 900,000 Kids Hospitalized with Coronavirus Hoax\nDozens of Environmental Hoaxes\nThe Alfa Bank Hoax\nLibs of TikTok Murdered Non-Binary Teen Hoax\nAaron Rodgers Sandy Hook-Truther Hoax\n‘Bloodbath’ Hoax\nBiden ‘Sharp-as-a-Tack’ Hoax\nIowa Poll Hoax\n\nA lot more people trust Joe Rogan and what they see on Xwitter than trust CNN or the Washington Post or NPR, or any of the rest.\n\nThey even trust Trump a lot more, a man who has spent a decade smeared as a racist, a felon, a rapist, a Russian spy, and the consumer of two scoops of ice cream.\n\nAt great personal cost to himself and his family, Trump broke the corporate media. In their zeal to annihilate him, they annihilated themselves. They were so wrapped up in their moral certainty that they didn’t think the public would care about the countless sins they committed to destroy one man. They bared their teeth, and then they bared their rancid and corrupt souls, and through it all, they were smug, humorless, self-serving, and pompous while the man they sought to destroy kept making his case and dancing to Y.M.C.A.\n\nAnd now, thanks to We The People, he has all the power and they have none.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

TRUMP HHS SECRETARY NOMINEE RFK JR TO STRESS HE'S NOT ‘ANTI-VACCINE’ AT CONFIRMATION HEARING These members of the world's greatest deliberative body, direct descendants of those in ancient Rome, should remember that SPQR, or Senatus Populusque Romanus, means The Senate and The People. And that the latter usually win in the end. The day before RFK, Jr.'s Aug. 23, 2024 endorsement of Trump, I wrote in this very space what independent and frustrated voters I met across the country who were ready to just sit it out had to say. Columnist Selena Zito, who might be the only person who expended more tire tread than I during the past election, had this to say this week on X: \"The most interesting voter bloc I saw in Pennsylvania move towards Trump happened when Bobby Kennedy Jr endorsed Trump & just enough young, college educated suburban moms who were concerned about what their children are eating, joined him.\" Between the disaffected voters I was talking to and the moms Zito met with, none of whom were overly fond of Trump, there were enough votes for Republicans to win up and down the ballot. Don’t want to trust the anecdotes and instincts of shoe-leather columnists? That’s a mistake, but for those who prefer analytical data, well, it shows up there too. On the day RFK, Jr. endorsed Trump, polls showed Kamala Harris had a 3.7 point lead over Trump. It was the largest lead she would ever have in the race. Elections have consequences, and millions of new Republican voters demand that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. at the helm of HHS be one of them. After RFK, Jr. threw in with the Donald, Harris fell and fell in the polling until we all know what happened. The health food moms and disgruntled dads Kennedy brought into the GOP fold are not going to take kindly to the bait and switch if oh-so-principled .senators replace their reason for voting Republican with a run-of-the-mill establishment lackey. There is likely only one bite at the apple that the Republican Party has with the RFK, Jr. voters. If they spit in their faces, they ain’t getting them back, and that could cause electoral woes in 2026 and beyond. CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION In terms of the American voter who matters, who is persuadable, or who might just sit it out, RFK, Jr. is as big a mandate as border security or the economy It would be foolish for Republican senators to ignore their will. RFK, Jr. is a symbol. For some, he represents a new way to think about health and the food supply. For others, he is a check on power, or the guy with nothing controlling him. To still others, he may remain a climate activist. All of that is as may be. What we know is that the voters who put this Republican majority in power, at least those who were not already on board, want Kennedy. And there no reason to fear that he’s going to cause a smallpox outbreak, ban penicillin, or outlaw the polio vaccine. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP In ancient Rome, when senators fell too far out of line with the people, bad things could happen. If the old school Trump-skeptical GOP members of the upper body of Congress defy the will of the people, it’s not just them falling on their own electoral sword, but the whole party.

Tim Walz is a creepy [clown]'. \n\nMusk came under fire last week for the gesture he made at President Trump's rally while he addressed a crowd of MAGA fanatics.\n\nBiting his bottom lip, the tech billionaire thumped his right hand over his heart and then extended his right arm out at an upward angle. \n\nThen he turned and made the same shocking hand gesture to the crowd behind him.\n\nThe signal was quickly scrutinized online, prompting critics to allege the gesture was an overt reference to Adolf Hitler and the Nazis.\n\nClaire Aubin, a historian who specializes in Nazism within the United States, said Musk's gesture was a 'sieg heil,' or Nazi salute.\n\nMy professional opinion is that you're all right, you should believe your eyes,' Aubin posted on X, aligning with those who found the gesture was an overt reference to Nazis.\n\nMusk took to his social media platform X to defend himself, stating that his opponents needed 'better dirty tricks' and that 'the 'everyone is Hitler' attack is sooo tired'.\n\nWalz also opened up in his interview about how it had been 'pure hell' since the Democratic party had lost the presidential election in November. \n\n'To the voters, I'm with this too. Everybody's fatigued. Trust me, I get it,' Walz said.\n\n'It was pure hell, and the disappointment and the frustration, and I'm, you know, soul-searching – what could we have done to make the case? \n\n'Because we knew this was coming. We knew the implication. And they're throwing so much at us that we're fatigued', he added. \n\nWalz and Kamala Harris were brutally defeated by Trump and VP JD Vance in the 2024 presidential election. \n\nWalz gained international prominence after Harris picked him to be her running mate.\n\nHe broke his silence on the election loss a few days after his defeat, in which he thanked his supporters.","summary":"Tim Walz ranted about how Americans had spent three days debating whether Musk had made the fascist hand gesture last week.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14337749/Elon-Musk-says-sue-Tim-Walz-said-Tesla-CEO.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/01/29/12/94634793-0-image-m-51_1738154888595.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 13:21:22","author":"Editor,Sabrina Penty","authors":["Editor","Sabrina Penty"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.306},{"id":285129954,"title":"Vogue launches vile attack on Melania Trump after Anna Wintour slobbered over Jill Biden and Kamala Harris","text":"Vogue launched a vicious review of Melania Trump's newly-revealed White House portrait, comparing the first lady's look to that of a magician. \n\nThe magazine spent four years fawning over the previous White House administration, featuring both Jill Biden and Kamala Harris on the cover several times each, and its latest piece on Melania reaffirms their preference for Democrats. \n\n'Trump look more like a freelance magician than a public servant,' wrote Hannah Jackson about the white-and-black portrait by Régine Mahaux.\n\nJackson raged against the 'situationally inappropriate tuxedo' worn by Melania for the historic photograph, which shows the first lady in a power pose.\n\n'Trump’s clothing certainly didn’t help the boardroom pastiche,' Jackson continued. \n\n'Trump looked more like she was guest starring on an episode of The Apprentice than assuming the role of first lady of the United States.'\n\nJackson concluded: 'It’s perhaps unsurprising that a woman who lived in a gold-encrusted penthouse, whose fame is so intertwined with a reality television empire, would refuse to abandon theatrics—even when faced with 248 years of tradition.'\n\nMelania Trump surprised her devoted Instagram followers with her new official White House portrait, which was unveiled on Monday.\n\nThe black and white image was a big departure from former First Ladies, who have traditionally chosen much more colorful images.\n\nInstead, Melania, whose stylist Hervé Pierre has revealed in the past that it's difficult to dress her because many American designers refuse, showed off a black Dolce & Gabbana pantsuit with a white shirt.\n\nThe Washington Monument was visible in the background.\n\nThe photo was taken on January 21, the day after the inauguration, in the Yellow Oval Room of the residence by Belgian photographer Mahaux.\n\nVogue famously excluded Melania from its pages while she was first lady, breaking its tradition of putting the presidents' wives on its coveted cover.\n\nMelania was secretly recorded in 2018 expressing rage that Vogue had not asked to feature her on its cover.\n\n'Vogue said like, oh, we want to do a profile. Profile? F*** you, profile. I don't need no profile. Yeah, what I need another profile? It might be a cover. I'm like, might be a cover? I don't give a f*** about Vogue and any magazine.'\n\nWhile Democratic first ladies such as Michelle Obama and Hillary Clinton were put on the Vogue cover, Republicans such as Laura and Barbara Bush were not. \n\nMelania, 54, shared the photo on the official FLOTUS Instagram account, which has four million followers.\n\nUnfortunately, many of the followers were left over from when they followed Jill Biden's account and were shocked to realize they were suddenly following Melania.\n\nBut Melania's followers adored the intense snap - and some even thought it looked like a Vogue cover - although some social media critics thought it appeared to be heavily Photoshopped.\n\nSome thought the picture looked strange, with one person saying, 'That's not an official photo. That's a heavily Photoshopped official photo.'\n\nOn X (previously Twitter), some people accused her of heavily editing the image.\n\n'Looks like she's made of plastic. It's so over-processed, heavy softening and blurring filtering. There's nothing warm or real about this image,' a commenter wrote disparagingly.\n\nSome of Melania's fans were recently left up in arms over the fact that she wasn't given the same respect in the fashion community that previous first ladies received despite the glamorous portrait.\n\n'Jill Biden was given three Vogue covers.

Kennedy, watching on live television, King spoke about “the fierce urgency of now.”\n\n“Now is the time to open the doors of opportunity to all of God’s children,” he said.\n\nInstead, Trump began purging federal workers in diversity, equity and inclusion roles as part of his promised war on “woke” culture.\n\n“I will also end the government policy of trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life,” he said during his inauguration speech.“We will forge a society that is colorblind and merit based.”\n\nMerit based. Just like he achieved his success.\n\n“Americans need the opportunity to get their foot in the door to achieve their dreams,” his opponent, Kamala Harris said during the campaign.\n\n“Not everyone has the luxury of being handed $400 million on a silver platter like Donald Trump.”\n\nTrump is the last person who should want to be judged by the content of his character.\n\nPorn star flings and sexual assault suits aside, Trump, with a straight face, claimed over the summer that his Jan. 6, 2021 “Stop the Steal” Rally was bigger than the estimated crowd of 250,000 who attended the March on Washington.\n\nThe House Select Committee that investigated the Jan. 6 insurrection estimated that Trump’s speech drew 53,000 supporters.\n\nMonths later, after winning back the presidency in November, he returned to the scene of the crime to be sworn in under the Capitol rotunda before granting a full pardon to the treasonous rioters who tried to take over the government on his behalf.\n\nDays earlier, then-President Joe Biden posthumously pardoned Pan African freedom fighter Marcus Garvey.\n\nContent of our character.\n\nAs for Trump’s attack on DEI, King definitely would not have been on board. In the same year he delivered his March on Washington speech, King wrote about righting history’s wrongs in his book “Why We Can’t Wait.”\n\n“The nation must not only radically readjust its attitude toward the Negro in the compelling present, but must incorporate in its planning some compensatory consideration for the handicaps he has inherited from the past,” King wrote.\n\n“It is impossible to create a formula for the future which does not take into account that our society has been doing something special against the Negro for hundreds of years.”\n\nLeonard Greene writes for the New York Daily News. ©2025 New York Daily News.

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., won’t stand for it.\n\n“The American people spoke when they voted President Trump into office,” Paul told The Daily Signal in a statement on the poll. “Any bureaucrat who does not follow the law because they consider it bad policy should be fired for cause—immediately.”\n\nThe poll, which RMG Research conducted on behalf of the Napolitan Institute and released earlier this month, revealed that 42% of what the survey characterizes as “federal government managers”—federal employees who live in the National Capital Region around Washington and earn at least $75,000 annually—plan to politically oppose the new administration.\n\nNearly two-thirds of those federal government managers who voted for Harris said they would ignore a lawful order from Trump if they regarded it to be bad policy. Only 17% of the Harris voters in the federal bureaucracy surveyed said they would follow Trump’s order.\n\nPaul joined other Republican senators in condemning this deep state effort against Trump.\n\n“Bureaucracy is the real threat to democracy,” Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, previously told The Daily Signal. Ernst leads the Senate DOGE Caucus, an effort to help the Department of Government Efficiency to cut federal waste and abuse. While the original DOGE was a nongovernmental panel led by Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, Trump recently announced he would be giving it a role inside the government, replacing the U.S. Digital Service.\n\nConservatives often warn that insulating federal bureaucrats from Congress and the president weakens the voters’ ability to have a say in their government.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, noted other efforts bureaucrats are taking to tie the new president’s hands.\n\n“Entrenched bureaucrats are already subverting President Trump’s agenda and working to box in the incoming administration and Republican Congress, including and especially on foreign policy,” Cruz previously told The Daily Signal. “President Trump and administration officials are going to have to focus immediately on ensuring such bureaucrats are fired.”\n\nSen. Katie Britt, R-Ala., condemned the deep state effort as “shameful” and endorsed some policies to combat it.\n\n“This polling data is shameful—civil servants must serve our nation, not their political party,” she told The Daily Signal. “The administrative state is a huge problem that demands serious reforms.”\n\nThe poll also found that Republicans who work in Washington federal offices are more likely to support Trump. Republican federal government managers proved more likely (74%) to say a bureaucrat should be fired for refusing a presidential order, while only 23% of Democratic managers agreed.\n\nRMG Research surveyed 500 federal government managers between Dec. 9 and Dec. 23.

Many federal agencies rely on this funding for day-to-day activities, including services like Social Security, defense, education and health care.A funding freeze could create uncertainty and lead to slowdowns or disruptions in essential services for citizens.What To KnowWyoming, Louisiana, South Dakota and Alaska are the states most reliant on federal government funding, with all of them having 50 percent or more of state revenue provided by the government.The states that are least dependent on government funding include Hawaii, Utah and Kansas, all of which had less than 28 percent of their state revenue provided by the federal government.Wyoming, Louisiana, South Dakota and Alaska all voted for Trump in the November 2024 election, as did Utah and Kansas. However, Hawaii voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris.Federal aid is distributed to states for services like transportation, public education, Medicaid, community development and other programs vital to residents, according to World Population Review.Per the outlet, states that receive more federal aid tend to have poorer populations, lower tax revenues and greater enrollment for programs like Medicaid, while states with higher-income residents tend to receive less federal aid.While California receives the highest total amount of federal funding at $43.61 billion, it only receives net federal funding of $12 per resident, according to World Population Review.In comparison, Virginia has the highest net federal funding per resident at $10,301, meaning the state receives a disproportionately high level of federal aid despite being one of the country's wealthier states, which could be because of its large defense contracting sectors.Before the pause called by the federal judge, the White House was planning to freeze federal grants and loans while the Trump administration reviewed government spending to ensure it followed the new executive orders.Federal agencies were instructed to assess their financial aid programs to determine which ones might be impacted. Medicare and Social Security benefits would not be affected.Trump's executive orders target changes to policies related to transgender rights, environmental justice, and diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI).What People Are SayingDemocrat Representative for Texas Jasmine Crockett wrote in a post on X on Tuesday: \"We've got six days to show Dictator Donald we're not about to let him steal the funds for the programs WE pay for so he can give tax cuts to his billionaire friends.\"Democratic Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock wrote in a post on X on Tuesday: \"This latest move by the Trump administration may impact everything from veteran programs to Medicaid to disaster relief. This isn't just chaotic, it's hurting Georgia families.\"The Trump administration must rescind this federal grant freeze *now*.\"Democratic New Jersey Senator Andy Kim's office wrote in a post on X on Tuesday: \"The announced freeze on federal funding is a thoughtless and illegal decision made by a Trump administration that doesn't know or care about the impact it has.\"Families across New Jersey will struggle to pay their bills, and seniors will go hungry. The American people are simply collateral damage.\"President Trump said in a conference in Las Vegas on January 25: \"And this week alone, I took nearly 350 executive actions to reverse the horrible failures and betrayals that we inherited from a group of people that didn't know what the hell they were doing. What they've done to the—what they've done to this country, especially the open borders, where they have—think of it—21 million people came in. Many of them are criminals, murderers.\"Our message could not be clearer: America's decline is over. American decline is over.\"What Happens NextJudge Loren AliKhan's order to pause the president's planned federal freeze came in response to a lawsuit filed in the day by a group of organizations that claimed the plan violated the law, the BBC reported.Per the outlet, the pause remains in place until next Monday at 5 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).","summary":"A funding freeze could create uncertainty and lead to slowdowns or disruptions in essential services for citizens.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/states-hit-hardest-federal-funding-freeze-map-2022599","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2575932/states-most-dependent-government.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-01-29 12:29:03","author":"Jasmine Laws","authors":["Jasmine Laws"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.172},{"id":285182454,"title":"Lady Gaga Vows to 'Fight' Trump Administration After Praying He Would Lose the Election","text":"Lady Gaga says she “prayed” for President Donald Trump to lose his election against Vice President Kamala Harris and has vowed to “fight” the Trump White House. \n\nSpeaking with Elle UK, the “Bad Romance” singer said that she has compassion for the many people who feel afraid of a new Trump term. \n\n“The main thing is I have so much compassion and love for so many people that are afraid today,” she said in the interview, which was conducted less than a week after Trump won the election.\n\n“I want to acknowledge I’m a very blessed person and I feel really grateful for so much in my life every day.

Trump told reporters Saturday night aboard Air Force One that he was not planning to install loyalists to the now vacant inspector general positions, assuring the press that “we’ll put people in there that will be very good.” Many of the officials he dismissed have a history of financially supporting the president’s political opponents.\n\nLoren Sciurba, who served as the inspector general at the Treasury Department, for instance, gave roughly $2,300 to former Vice President Kamala Harris and other Democratic campaigns during the 2024 election cycle. The FEC has records of Sciurba donating to Democrats as far back as 2014, though the vast majority of his roughly $3,000 in lifetime contributions came during the most recent election cycle.\n\nProPublica obtained a video from the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 political appointee training module in which conservative opposition researcher Tom Jones advised that the incoming administration clear out ideologically motivated inspectors general to avoid “witch hunts” and select new officials who will “ensure that waste, fraud, and abuse is rooted out.” The president publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 on the campaign trail.\n\nOther ousted inspectors general with a history of Democratic donations included Christi Grimm of the Department of Health and Human Services, Robert Storch of the Defense Department, Michael Missal of the Department of Veterans Affairs, Krista Boyd of the Office of Personnel Management, and John Sopko, who served as the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction.\n\nSopko has donated thousands to Democratic political committees over his lifetime, Boyd made multiple contributions to Hillary Clinton’s 2016 presidential campaign, while Missal and Storch were both donors to former President Barack Obama.\n\nStorch, despite donating $1,500 to Obama and the Democratic National Committee, was sharply critical of former President Joe Biden’s withdrawal from Afghanistan. In remarks given to the House Oversight Committee, Storch said the American-supported Afghani army was not “self-sufficient and resilient” prior to the U.S. withdrawal in early 2021.\n\nOverall, the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General found that the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces “became overreliant on U.S. and coalition forces to execute essential functions, such as training, logistics, maintenance, and support,” Storch said. “Senior U.S. leaders acknowledged that the ANDSF remained overly dependent on U.S. and international support. Additionally, corruption within Afghan security institutions was a contributing factor in the collapse of the Afghan government, according to DoD officials.”\n\nSopko also displayed a willingness to release information damaging to the Biden administration during his tenure at the Office of the SIGAR, reporting in 2024 that taxpayer-funded aid had fallen into the hands of the Taliban.\n\nA few of the inspectors general dismissed by Trump had a history of donating to Republicans.\n\nMark Greenblatt, whom Trump previously appointed to serve as inspector general for the Interior Department and was part of the most recent round of firings, meanwhile, warned in an interview with the New York Times that the president risks setting off “a never-ending cycle of politicization” by incentivizing future Democratic presidents to fire his appointees.\n\nGreenblatt, who worked as a Senate Republican staffer in the 2000s, donated $850 to Republican political campaigns between 2006 and 2007, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani’s presidential bid, according to FEC records.\n\nInspectors general Eric Soskin of the Transportation Department and Sean O’Donnell of the Environmental Protection Agency, meanwhile, also previously donated to Republicans. While O’Donnell’s only contributions were to former presidential candidate Mitt Romney, whom Trump publicly dislikes, Soskin gave roughly $100 to Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign. Soskin also gave over $1,000 to Romney’s 2012 campaign.\n\nThere is some evidence that Trump may have retained inspectors general that he feels will give him favorable coverage.\n\nMichael Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general, survived Trump’s wave of Friday night firings. The president previously praised his work.\n\n“Michael Horowitz, we’re keeping,” Trump said Saturday. “I thought his report on [former FBI Director James] Comey was incredible, actually. Such an accurate, well-done report.”\n\nThe president was referencing a report produced by Horowitz that was critical of Comey’s investigation into the 2016 Trump campaign. Horowitz has also criticized the FBI for forcing an agent to go on unpaid leave for years after he questioned how the agency was handling the investigation of the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\nThe impact of Trump’s inspector general firings remains up in the air as some argue the dismissals were illegal. State Department Inspector General Cardell Richardson, who was among those fired, even told his staff to show up for work in defiance of the president.\n\nThe White House did not respond to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment.","summary":"At least six of the inspectors general recently dismissed by President Donald Trump had a history of donating to Democratic political committees, a Washington Examiner analysis has found.

However, Trump swept nearly every border county.\n\nHer sales tripled and the store began making a profit again. It hasn’t been a total sugar high.\n\nIn response to her post, Ramos received harassing messages including death threats.\n\nAs a precaution, she joined the Edinburg Police Department's \"Business Watch\" program by which police officers stop by to check up on her store on occasion.\n\nThe backlash also grabbed the attention of U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, who posted a photo of herself with Ramos on social media in December, encouraging the community to support the small business.\n\nCorporations and business leaders have long injected themselves into politics and cultural trends, hoping to capitalize on popular sentiment. Businesses often donate to political candidates and give to nonprofits. However, as national politics become more common in daily lives, the call to support or divest from companies based on politics has become more heightened. Those political battle lines extended closer to home as small businesses attached themselves to national politics.\n\nIn fact, Ramos isn’t the only Texas-based baker to have her foray into politics gain attention. The owner of a Dallas-area bakery, who has made her liberal leanings public, received harassing messages and fake orders following Trump's victory. And like Ramos, she also received a swell of support from like-minded customers.\n\nRamos anticipated some customers would not be happy, even though she didn't intend to antagonize anyone, she assured. In fact, before the election, she featured doughnuts that promoted both Trump and his Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris.

In fact, it’s heating up again. Last week, a Democratic Mississippi state senator with a wry sense of humor introduced a law meant to call attention to the absurdity of America's enduring efforts to control women’s bodies. Sen. Bradford Blackmon, 36, introduced the “Contraception Begins at Erection Act,” which would criminalize ejaculation — “the discharge of genetic material” — without the “intent to fertilize an embryo.” Yes, it’s silly. But he has a point. Why should women shoulder all the responsibility for unwanted pregnancies? Without men ejaculating irresponsibly, after all, there would be none. In a written statement, Blackmon noted that the 2022 Supreme Court case that reversed women’s right to abortion originated in Mississippi, where it is now illegal to have an abortion unless the life of the mother is at risk, or the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest that has been reported to law enforcement — as if, say, a violated adolescent is going to run straight to the police. In 2023, a 13-year-old girl in Clarkesville, Miss., who was raped by a stranger was forced to give birth because her mother could not afford to take her to the nearest abortion provider, 600 miles away in Chicago. She started seventh grade as a new mother. This protects children? “The filing of this bill is to point out the double standards in legislation,” said Blackmon. “You have male-dominated legislatures in Mississippi and all over the country that pass laws that dictate what a woman can and cannot do with her body.” His words echo a famous 2018 exchange between then-U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and then-Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing. “Can you think of any laws that give government the power to make decisions about the male body?” Harris asked. Kavanaugh stuttered, then admitted he could not. Over the last week or so, President Trump has signaled to the antiabortion wing of his base that despite his campaign promises, he will not leave abortion regulation to the states. On Friday, he revived a slew of antiabortion policies that President Biden had overturned. Trump reversed a Biden order that government agencies “protect and expand” access to abortion care, including medication abortion, birth control and emergency contraception. He has also reinstated the Reagan-era “Mexico City policy,” which Democratic presidents ritually suspend and Republicans reinstate. The policy forbids foreign groups that receive U.S. funding from providing or promoting family planning that includes abortion — even if the funds they use for that purpose do not come from the United States. (Critics call it a global gag rule.) These are not benign policy shifts; people die when denied access to abortion care, and studies show that when the Mexico City policy is in effect, contraceptive use and family planning diminish overall. In 2022, a National Academy of Sciences study found that the Mexico City policy is associated with higher maternal- and child-mortality rates, and higher HIV rates, worldwide. During Trump’s first presidency, according to the academy, the policy resulted in approximately 108,000 maternal and child deaths and 360,000 new HIV infections. In 2011, a Stanford University study found that the number of abortions in 20 African countries actually rose when the Mexico City policy was revived during the second George W. Bush administration, after having been suspended during the Clinton administration. Less access to contraception, the researchers theorized, may have led women to substitute abortion for birth control. Last week, Trump also pardoned 23 antiabortion extremists, including some who were convicted of violently invading and blockading an abortion clinic in Washington, D.C., in 2020, forcing it to temporarily shut down. Trump described the radicals — some of whom were in federal prison — as “peaceful pro-life protesters.” “They should not have been prosecuted,” he said. “Many of them are elderly people.” If they were so fragile, how did they manage to injure clinic workers as they used bicycle locks, ropes, furniture and their bodies to barricade the clinic doors? You may recall a bizarre footnote to this case: protest instigator Lauren Handy, 31, was found to have five fetuses in her refrigerator. She and her fellow extremists are now free to obstruct abortion clinics again. As Slate legal analyst Dahlia Lithwick put it last week: “Anybody who decided to take the law into their own hands is just fine as long as they were doing it for something that Donald Trump likes.” Bluesky: @rabcarian.bsky.social.

He now bakes at the shop full-time.\n\nShe opened the store in May 2022 after running a construction company with her ex-husband. As the COVID-19 pandemic prompted businesses to rely more on social media, she used platforms like Instagram to gain popularity in the community. But in August, her sales dropped, sometimes only raking in as little as $200 a day. Ramos announced to the shop's Instagram followers that Papy Donuts would be closing.\n\nThen she tried one more \"Hail Mary\" shot at bringing in more people to her store: Trump-themed doughnut.\n\nThe day after Election Day, Ramos announced on Instagram she would sell doughnuts covered in red frosting with the words \"Trump\" in white icing for one dollar.\n\nPeople flocked to her shop for the Trump doughnut.\n\n\"They were a big hit,\" she said. \"To this day, people ask for them.\"\n\nEdinburg, part of the Rio Grande Valley along the southern border, has long been considered a Democratic stronghold in Texas. However, Trump swept nearly every border county.\n\nHer sales tripled and the store began making a profit again. It hasn’t been a total sugar high.\n\nIn response to her post, Ramos received harassing messages including death threats.\n\nAs a precaution, she joined the Edinburg Police Department's \"Business Watch\" program by which police officers stop by to check up on her store on occasion.\n\nThe backlash also grabbed the attention of U.S. Rep. Monica De La Cruz, R-Edinburg, who posted a photo of herself with Ramos on social media in December, encouraging the community to support the small business.\n\nCorporations and business leaders have long injected themselves into politics and cultural trends, hoping to capitalize on popular sentiment. Businesses often donate to political candidates and give to nonprofits. However, as national politics become more common in daily lives, the call to support or divest from companies based on politics has become more heightened. Those political battle lines extended closer to home as small businesses attached themselves to national politics.\n\nIn fact, Ramos isn’t the only Texas-based baker to have her foray into politics gain attention. The owner of a Dallas-area bakery, who has made her liberal leanings public, received harassing messages and fake orders following Trump's victory. And like Ramos, she also received a swell of support from like-minded customers.\n\nRamos anticipated some customers would not be happy, even though she didn't intend to antagonize anyone, she assured. In fact, before the election, she featured doughnuts that promoted both Trump and his Democratic challenger Vice President Kamala Harris.
