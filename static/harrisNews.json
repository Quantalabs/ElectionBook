Anyone who still believes these assaults are directed toward criminals is choosing to remain ignorant. There’s overwhelming evidence that ICE routinely detains people solely due to the color of their skin, and without warrants. The trauma and destruction caused by these unconstitutional detainments include deaths, sexual abuse and neglect in ICE custody; denial of due process rights; the disappearances of hundreds after the closure of ‘Alligator Alcatraz’; and assaults on peaceful protesters.\n\nAs a Catholic, I note that Pope Leo XIV stated that being “pro-life” should include opposition to the inhumane treatment of immigrants. The pope called for reflection on the treatment of detained migrants. It’s imperative that people of goodwill do everything we can to stop ICE’s aggressive and criminal behavior.\n\nLaura Murray\n\nSJ must make sure\nprogress includes all\n\nAs an African American student at Evergreen Valley College, I see our community’s future being priced out.\n\nMany of us, especially from Black and Brown neighborhoods, are watching our families get squeezed by rising rents while new tech jobs pour in. This isn’t just about buildings; it’s about people. We need the city to ensure that new corporate growth directly funds affordable housing and protects tenants from unfair rent hikes and evictions.\n\nWe can’t create a vibrant San Jose if the people who make it diverse and strong themselves can’t even afford to stay here. Let’s make sure progress includes everyone.\n\nDemari Agbulos\n\nDOJ won’t prosecute\nMAGA lawbreakers\n\nRe: “Justice demands prosecuting fake electors” (Page A7, Nov. 21).\n\nIn his column, Mark Barabak quotes Derek Muller, a Notre Dame law professor (and a long-time member of the Federalist Society, the judicial arm of the anti-democracy MAGA movement).\n\nRegarding fake electors, Muller suggests that “the ballot box — rather than a courtroom — may be the better venue to litigate the matter.”\n\nApparently, Muller attended the “Alice In Wonderland Law School” where he undoubtedly received an A+ in circular logic.\n\nIt is against the law to overturn the outcome of a presidential election; it is idiotic to say that when a bunch of MAGA criminals break election laws, we should rely on another election (in which MAGA operatives are hard at work illegally suppressing the votes of millions of likely Democratic voters), instead of prosecuting MAGA criminals to the full extent of the law.\n\nNo wonder people distrust lawyers — especially when they promote excusing law-breaking instead of prosecuting the lawbreakers.\n\nBill Charleston\n\nVictory more important\nthan female president\n\nRe: “How long until we elect a female president” (Page A7, Nov. 20).\n\nA half-page column in the Mercury News asks, “How long until we elect a female president?” The author finds it “kind of depressing” that this January, the country will have reached “the historic moment when 28% of its governors are female.” I’m old enough to be impressed, not depressed, by this statistic.\n\nMore importantly, I implore Democrats to focus on the much more important goal of defeating the Republicans in 2028. In both 2016 and 2024, we elected Donald Trump over much more experienced women, who believed in the rule of law and our democracy. While I volunteered for the Kamala Harris campaign in 2024, our country is simply not yet ready for a woman leader, as more enlightened countries such as India, Pakistan, Germany, Israel and Great Britain have shown themselves to be.\n\nGiven the apparent misogynistic nature of the American voters, let’s not repeat the mistakes of 2016 and 2024.\n\nUkraine peace plan\nfavors the invaders\n\nRe: “Trump offers a Ukraine peace plan Kremlin can love” (Page A4, Nov. 23).\n\nThe word is that Russia is in on a full war production level and showing it by an atmospheric rain of drones on civilian and energy targets. I have never understood the timid arms policy that forbids Ukraine from having weapons with mileage into Russia. Vladimir Putin understands force only. Is Donald Trump so dazzled by the vision of a Nobel Peace Prize that the art of the deal and the cards Trump holds created this outrageous peace plan?\n\nThis is worse than the Munich Deal that led to WWII. To give up even more land on its Black Sea ports, considering Russia’s efforts to blockade grain shipments, would be disastrous. To limit its army to 600,000, forbid NATO membership, and not allow long-range weapons is another gift to dictator Putin, who feeds on such rewards, like Crimea he took in 2014.\n\nIt’s time for Congress to wake up.\n\nDavid Eisbach","summary":"Also: Include all &#124; Prosecute lawbreakers &#124; Put victory first &#124; Favoring Putin.

Trump, 79, did not mince words as he directed a slur at Walz and questioned the legal status of Representative Ilhan Omar, sparking immediate backlash from leaders and residents across the state.Trump's 'Retarded' Slur Sparks OutrageThe President's message centred on a direct and offensive attack against Tim Walz, the Democratic governor who recently ran alongside Kamala Harris in her failed presidential bid. In a statement that stunned political observers for its crudeness, Trump referred to the governor as 'seriously retarded', a slur widely condemned by disability advocates. He accused Walz of negligence, claiming the governor allowed 'Somalian gangs' to terrorise residents.'The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both,' Trump wrote in the blistering post.This language marks a significant departure from standard political discourse, using a term that has long been recognised as hate speech against people with intellectual disabilities. The attack appears to be part of a broader strategy to delegitimise Walz's leadership in Minnesota, a state Trump has frequently targeted in his political rallies.Attacks on Ilhan Omar and Somali ResidentsTrump's invective did not stop at Tim Walz; he also launched a racially charged attack on Representative Ilhan Omar and the broader Somali community in Minnesota.He described Omar, a frequent target of his ire, as the 'worst \"Congressman/woman in our country and mocked her religious attire, stating she is 'always wrapped in her swaddling hijab. Going further, Trump cast doubt on her citizenship without evidence, claiming the Somali-born lawmaker probably came into the USA illegally'.These comments were paired with baseless assertions about the safety of Minnesota's streets. Trump painted a dystopian picture of the state, alleging that 'Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for \"prey\" as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone'.This rhetoric comes just days after Trump ordered a review of all green cards from Somalia and 18 other nations. He also threatened to terminate temporary protected status for Somalis in Minnesota, a move that would affect thousands of legal residents in a state that is home to roughly 80,000 Somali people—the largest such population in the US.Walz Hits Back at Mental FitnessGovernor Tim Walz wasted little time in responding to the insults, though he chose to pivot the conversation away from the slur and towards Trump's own fitness for office. Rather than engaging in a war of words over the specific insults, Walz challenged the transparency of Trump's recent medical claims.'Release the MRI results,' Walz posted on X, a direct reference to Trump's recent assertion that a medical checkup had returned 'perfect' results.This retort highlights a growing Democratic strategy of questioning the 79-year-old president's cognitive health, turning his own attacks on competency back against him. When reached for further comment by local media, Walz's office directed reporters back to this social media post, letting the brevity of the response speak for itself.Immigration Policy Shifts and 'Reverse Migration'The context for this outburst appears to be a recent violent incident in Washington, DC, involving a 29-year-old Afghan national accused of shooting two National Guard members.The suspect, who had previously worked with the CIA during the Afghanistan War, has been charged in an attack that left one service member dead and another critically wounded.Seizing on this tragedy, Trump used his Thanksgiving message to call for drastic changes to US immigration policy. He vowed to 'permanently pause migration' from poorer nations and introduced the concept of 'reverse migration' as a necessary solution.'Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,' Trump declared.He later expanded on this threat, stating he would suspend immigration 'from all Third World Countries to allow the US system to recover fully'.However, the President provided no details on how such a sweeping policy would be implemented, nor did he specify which nations would be classified under this designation.The message concluded with a jarring shift in tone, offering a holiday greeting that excluded his political enemies. 'Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You won't be here for long!","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/trump-rages-seriously-retarded-walz-presidents-slur-sparks-outcry-1758847","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1772170/donald-trump-called-tim-walz-retarded-x-post.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=2c0c1183546ecf41b28cbf02a0ee0a2d","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 22:41:58","author":"Daniel Joshua Flores","authors":["Daniel Joshua Flores"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.15},{"id":383218934,"title":"Political turkeys of 2025: Blunders of 2025 that will never be pardoned by the public","text":"With the year winding down, 2025 has left many top Democratic figures wishing things had turned out differently — or maybe that the public had put its focus elsewhere. Here are the top political turkeys ripped by conservatives in the past year. Chuck Schumer Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., has received scorching criticisms from Republicans and Democrats alike in the wake of a 43-day government shutdown that left Democrats empty-handed. Democrats led by Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., had refused to advance spending legislation to keep the government open past Oct. 1 without first considering extensions to supplemental funding for Obamacare. But by the end of a painful and highly visible shutdown — the longest in the country’s history — Republicans had rebuffed efforts to negotiate over the subsidies. Without an off-ramp or negotiating strategy, even the chamber’s most progressive members expressed doubts about continuing the shutdown. \"I just don’t get what the point is of delaying even longer,\" Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said just moments after a key vote to reopen the government cleared the Senate. Many Democrats in and out of Congress blamed Schumer for failing to either keep Democrats united in their standoff over the subsidies or for failing to deliver on some other sort of concession. Across both chambers on Capitol Hill, Schumer faces questions about his continued role as the party's leader in the Senate. CHUCK SCHUMER BECOMES TOP TARGET FROM MEDIA PERSONALITIES AMID SHUTDOWN FALLOUT Kamala Harris The country’s worst kept secret got a fresh coat of paint in 2025 when a groundbreaking book by CNN’s Jake Tapper and Axios reporter Alex Thompson took readers behind the scenes of President Joe Biden’s physical decline — and the effort to hide it. Questions about what Vice President Kamala Harris knew about Biden’s cognitive state rebounded in the wake of the book’s publication. Harris — who maintains that Biden could have served out another term — would eventually take his place as the Democrat on the ticket in 2024. At the time, Harris’ stand-in for Biden was seen by many in the party as the obvious choice. But that view soured later when President Donald Trump stormed to victory in November and questions arose about whether Harris should have joined the calls for Biden to step down. KAMALA HARRIS DOESN'T RULE OUT ANOTHER PRESIDENTIAL RUN IN NEW INTERVIEW: ‘I AM NOT DONE’ The autopen The presidential walk of fame at the White House features portraits of every president — except one. Instead of President Joe Biden, the Trump administration put up a picture of an autopen, a device used to mimic the signature of someone else, symbolizing President Joe Biden’s reliance on his inner circle to make presidential-level decisions. The House of Representatives launched an investigation into just how much of his power Biden decided to delegate. In a report put out in October, the House Oversight Committee slammed the Biden administration for what it called \"invalid executive actions.\" \"The report exposes how President Joe Biden’s top advisors, political operatives, and personal physician concealed the President’s mental and physical decline from the American people. The findings reveal that as President Biden’s condition deteriorated, his aides exercised presidential authority and facilitated executive actions without his direct authorization,\" the report states. Questions remain about just how far Biden's use of the autopen went and whether the legal standing of sensitive decisions like pardons could receive a second look. Andrew Cuomo The former governor of New York attempted a political comeback in 2025 by running for New York City mayor. The bid, which came after disastrous management of the state’s nursing home facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic and sexual harassment allegations during his time as governor, did little to improve his political standing. Cuomo failed to capture the Democratic Party nomination, ultimately losing out to Zohran Mamdani by 7.7 percentage points. Refusing to call it quits, Cuomo launched an independent campaign. There, Cuomo again fell behind Mamdani — this time by almost nine points. In addition to a personal loss, Cuomo’s defeat dovetails with questions about whether more traditional Democrats can still compete with the vision offered by far-left figures in the party. \"This campaign was necessary to make that point – a caution flag that we are heading down a dangerous, dangerous road,\" Cuomo said in his concession speech. \"Well, we made that point, and they heard us, and we will hold them to it.\" FROM AOC TO ZOHRAN MAMDANI, THE DEMOCRATS ARE PEDDLING FAR-LEFT POLITICS Chuck Schumer — again Schumer’s woes over the shutdown weren’t the only sore spot for the Senate minority leader in the last few months. The meteoric rise of Zohran Mamdani put this year’s biggest political turkey in a pressure cooker he could not escape. He first faced questions about Mamdani in the lead up to the New York mayoral primary. Then reporters began to ask him if he would endorse Mamdani after the self-proclaimed socialist secured the Democratic nomination. And even in the closing days of the race, Schumer faced questions about whether he had made a decision to support the race’s clear front-runner. Through it all, Schumer gave the same non-answer. \"Look, the bottom line is very simple. I have a good relationship with him, and we’re continuing to talk,\" Schumer told reporters less than a week out from the election. While other Democrats, including Jeffries, also delayed in giving responses about Mamdani, Schumer’s refusal to speak on the New York City Mayoral race stands out. Schumer’s dismissal of the topic fueled questions about the direction of the Democratic Party and whether its congressional factions could play along with the momentum of its leftward flank.

He used derogatory language to refer to Walz and accused Omar of engaging in incest, all while proposing an extreme solution for handling illegal immigration.\n\nFollowing an incident earlier in the week where two National Guard soldiers were shot near the White House, Trump took to Truth Social to declare his intention to halt all immigration from what he termed ‘third world’ countries. Tragically, one of the soldiers, Sarah Beckstrom, succumbed to her injuries on Thanksgiving.\n\nTrump further alleged that Tim Walz, the governor of Minnesota and former running mate of Kamala Harris, has permitted an influx of Somali migrants who, according to Trump, terrorize the local population.\n\n“Somalian gangs are roaming the streets, searching for victims while our wonderful citizens remain confined in their homes, praying for safety,” Trump expressed in his post on Truth Social.\n\nHe continued by labeling Governor Walz as “seriously retarded,” attributing his inaction to either fear, incompetence, or both.\n\nTurning his focus to Ilhan Omar, a representative from Minnesota, Trump mocked her traditional attire and made unfounded claims about her immigration status, suggesting she entered the U.S. unlawfully by marrying her brother.\n\n‘Probably came into the USA. illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated.’\n\nThe president ended his rant by vowing to ‘cure’ the issue of migration with ‘reverse migration,’ claiming ‘disruptive populations’ were admitted into the US via Joe Biden’s ‘illegal autopen approval.’\n\n‘Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for.’\n\nWalz responded to Trump’s insults by questioning the state of the president’s health.\n\n‘Release the MRI results,’ Walz wrote on X. During a recent health check-up, Trump had an MRI scan, the results of which remain undisclosed.\n\nTrump’s rant occurred hours after he announced that Beckstrom had tragically succumbed to her injuries on Thursday.\n\nAfghan migrant Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was named as the alleged gunman in custody over the shooting.\n\nLakanwal was admitted into the country under the Biden administration in 2021 following the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan.

It took the city and City Council years to let this iconic building decline through poor maintenance management.

Gentile, Dallas\n\nPreferential access\n\nRe: “AP, administration continue fight over access,” Tuesday news story.\n\nI found this article interesting. The Associated Press is suing the administration because of limited access in small Trump press meetings. It seems reasonable to me that if President Donald Trump is holding a press conference in the Oval Office or on Air Force One and has limited space, he would give preferential access to a news outlet that perhaps will write more positive articles about him or his administration, which is extremely unlikely of the AP. After all, there is limited space. \n\nI read The Dallas Morning News daily and have yet to read anything but negative, slanted articles from The Associated Press that pertain to the president. I don’t expect all to be positive, but the president has done a lot of good that the reader never hears about from the AP. What is wrong with “fair and balanced”?\n\nLynda H. Leake, Dallas/Uptown\n\nSpecies decline\n\nIt was disheartening to learn that the Interior Department is rolling back rules for preserving endangered species and their environments. When you consider that the only life we know of to date is on this planet, all forms of life on Earth are incredibly precious and rare. \n\nBecause of human industrialization and massive population growth, we have been losing species at a rate that mirrors some of the greatest mass extinctions in geologic history. To undercut the modest efforts we make to slow this downward spiral for the sake of enabling easier human development in critical habitats is incredibly short-sighted. \n\nThe ecosystems of our world are being knocked out of balance. As species die off, the natural processes that provide for us die off with them. The serious decline of pollinating bees necessary to produce the crops we need is a clear example. \n\nWe need our Congress to assert its responsibility to counter the administration’s efforts to put profits before the long-term health of our ecosystems by preserving and expanding the Endangered Species Act. Contact your senators and your representatives and urge them to act.\n\nJim Brady, Dallas\n\nI’ll throw in depository building\n\nRe: “Put Epstein in the rearview,” by Jimmie George, Sunday Letters.\n\nThe author of this letter says that it’s time to move on from the Jeffrey Epstein matter because there’s nothing new and important to be learned. On the other hand, the letter states, “And if you believe he committed suicide, I’ll sell you the Golden Gate Bridge at a good price.”\n\nIf the author believes so adamantly that Epstein didn’t commit suicide, which was only a little over six years ago, that means whoever planned his demise (i.e., murder) is probably still alive. That, in turn, means there’s evidently a big cover-up going on, not just about his murder, but regarding those who were Epstein’s accomplices in committing the heinous crimes he and Ghislaine Maxwell committed.\n\nIf you believe there’s no reason to uncover the truth — and it’s not just the majority of Democrats, but also Republicans and independents who want it — I’ll sell you the Golden Gate Bridge and throw in the Texas School Book Depository.\n\nLarry Postel, Dallas\n\nIf AI runs rampant\n\nRe: “The AI Kids Are Not Alright,” by Javier E. David, Sunday Business.\n\nSpot on! Until we realize the full extent of letting AI run rampant in business, government and the arts, I highly recommend one read Ira Levin’s novel, This Perfect Day. If this doesn’t open your eyes to AI utopia, nothing will.\n\nJohn Eggen, Red Oak\n\nSchool choice\n\nRe: “Schools wane as population swells,” Sunday Metro story.\n\nThe last part of this excellent article, which lays out the problems facing government schools with declining enrollment, says it all: “Experts [which ones?] say public schools need to start getting creative. ... The school districts are really going to need to really promote their success, and that’s kind of a new thing for school districts.” \n\nAmen and right on.

In the wake of the murder of one, and grave injury of a second National Guard troop patrolling the streets of Downtown Washington DC on his orders, Trump is ramping up his purge of foreign born people in the United States. In a statement on Truth Social last night, he said his ban-hammer would no longer be confined to people who entered the country illegally. Nor will it only be for people who share the Afghan background of the alleged shooter, nor just people who came in under the refugee programme from that country. No, he's repeatedly taken aim at the Somali community in Minnesota, almost all of whom are legal residents - and many of whom are citizens. Why? Because they're from - and I'm using his words here - a \"third world country\". He confirmed neither a green card nor citizenship would be an exemption from his purge. And he said those who should be worried are people who \"undermine domestic tranquility\", who are \"a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilisation.\" Which sounds awfully broad and open to some pretty bad-faith interpretation. Pretty racist too, if we're counting. Meanwhile in Trumpworld Here's everything you need to know Donald Trump announced a huge ramp-up in his plan for mass deportations of even legal migrants to the US in response to the Washington DC shooting. The attack, which left one National Guard troop dead and another fighting for his life, was allegedly committed by Rahmanullah Lakanwal, an Afghan national allowed into the US following the fall of Kabul in 2021. But in a late-night flurry of posts on Truth Social, he confirmed his response would not be restricted to those he held responsible for the shooting - but to any migrant community he feels is \"undermining\" America. \"Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation,\" he wrote. \"Other than that HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that hate, steal, murder and destroy everything that America stands for - you won't be here for long!\" Using the outdated term \"third world countries\", the US President announced a \"pause\" on migration from certain parts of the world - during which the US would seek to remove anyone who is not a \"net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.\" Using the outdated term \"third world countries\", the US President announced a \"pause\" on migration from certain parts of the world - during which the US would seek to remove anyone who is not a \"net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.\" He said all federal benefits to non-citizens would be scrapped, and that even citizens could have their status revoked if they \"undermine domestic tranquility.\" He went on to say his plan for mass deportations would be expanded to include \"any Foreign National who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.\" Trump confirmed specifically that those who hold \"green card\" permanent residency status would not be exempt from the purge. Every time Trump has addressed the shootings since Wednesday afternoon, Trump has started out by blaming the Afghan community, before quickly swerving to attack Somali people in Minnesota. In his Truth Social screed last night he said Minnesota governor Tim Walz - who was Kamala Harris' running mate in 2024 - was \"seriously retarded\" for allowing a Somalian community to \"completely take over his state. This is untrue. Around 80,000 Somali people live in Minnesota, out of a population of 5.7 million people - making them less than 1.5% of the total. Even in the large 'Twin Cities' area of Minneapolis, St Paul and Bloomington, where the vast majority of Somali Minnesotans live, they make up just 1.7% of the population. He launched a horrific, racist attack on Ilhan Omar, a sitting member of Congress from Minnesota with a Somali background, saying she was \"always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and who probably came into the USA illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how \"badly\" she is treated, when her place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which is essentially not even a country.\" Ms Omar came to the US with her family, who legally claimed asylum in 1995, when she was 14. She became a US citizen in 2000, when she was 17. She was not married when she was granted citizenship. Trump gave a Q&A after speaking by video link to serving troops last night. He was asked what Somali people had to do with the shooting. He admitted: \"Nothing.\" But he went on: \"Somalians have caused a lot of trouble, they're ripping us off for a lot of money, there's a tremendous amount of money going back to Somalia. What the hell are we paying money to Somalia for? But they're ripping off our country at a level that few people have been able to see before.\" He then repeated some of his attacks on Ms Omar. Because it's basically breathing at this point. Asked if he was going to attend the funeral of murdered National Guard troop Sarah Beckstrom, Trump replied: \"I haven't thought about it yet, but it's certainly something I can conceive of. I love West Virginia. You know, I won West Virginia by one of the biggest margins of any president anywhere.\" Trump, as we know, does not like to be bothered with reality and facts. So when a reporter noted that Homeland Security officials had confirmed the alleged DC shooter had worked \"very closely with the CIA for years\", was vetted and came up clean - he did not enjoy that. He replied: \"He went cuckoo. He went nuts. And that happens too. It happens too often with these people. You see them. But, er, look. This is how they came in.\" He raised up a printed out photo of a full planeload of Afghans - many of them interpreters and fixers for US troops stationed in Afghanistan - being rescued from the Taliban. He continued: \"This is how they come in. They're standing on top of each other. That's an airplane. There was no vetting. They came in un-vetted. We have a lot of others in this country but we're going to get them out. They go cookoo.\" In fact, the refugees were not standing on top of each other. The 640 or so people on the US Air Force C17 aircraft pictured were seated on the floor of the aircraft using a procedure known as \"floor loading\", where cargo straps are run from wall to wall in the plane's hold for passengers to hang on to as makeshift seatbelts. Trump liked it even less when she pointed out that the Department of Justice's Inspector General just reported that there was \"thorough vetting of Afghans who were brought into the US.\" \"Are you stupid?\" He barked at the diligent reporter. \"Are you a stupid person? Because they came in on a plane along with thousands of other people that shouldn't be here and you're just asking questions because you're a stupid person. And there's a law passed that makes it almost impossible to get them out. You can't get them out once they come in. And they came in, and they were unvetted. They were unchecked. There were many of them, and they came in on big planes and it was disgraceful.\" Every element of that answer is untrue, with one exception: They were indeed big planes. At the same event, Trump was asked to confirm that it was his administration that granted the alleged shooter asylum. Trump replied: \"When it comes to asylum, when they're flown in, it's very hard to get them out. No matter how you want to do it it's very hard to get them out. But we're going to be getting them all out now.\" With that, he thumped the table, presumably in celebration of not actually admitting that yes, it was his administration that vetted and granted the alleged shooter asylum seven months ago, and wrapped up the session. Since the campaign, Trump has made an increasingly preposterous claim about the number of illegal migrants who were allowed into the US during Joe Biden's presidency. The number varies from time to time, but the most common version is that \"20 million\" people entered the US illegally over the four years Biden was president. Trump repeats this at least once a week, and it's always been nonsense. He said: \"The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people (Census)\" This is pretty close to true. The actual figure from the Census bureau is 51.3 millon, which is up from 45.2 million when Trump was last in office. That figure counts foreign born citizens and non-citizens - which would also include any surveyed undocumented people. So if the total foreign born population went up by 6.1 million, despite 20 million coming in illegally, then 13.9 million would have had to leave during the same time period. 13 million people is about one in 24 of the US population. That's the kind of population turnover that gets noticed.","summary":"Trump last night made an announcement that could set the tone for the rest of his presidency, as he ramps up his purge of foreign-born people in the US","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/mikey-smith-8-unhinged-donald-36324778","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36324755.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_Trump-25332039406057.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 17:26:30","author":"Mikey Smith","authors":["Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.396},{"id":383151810,"title":"Walz hits back at Trump with four-word taunt after president’s mental health slur","text":"Governor Tim Walz has hit back at Donald Trump after the president used a mental health slur against him in a Thanksgiving rant. \n\nTrump’s post began by telling Americans to have a happy Thanksgiving but then segued into a series of attacks, against the politically correct, migrants, refugees and eventually Walz. \n\nThe president using a slur that criticised the former Democratic vice-presidential candidate’s decision-making abilities. “Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both,” he added, before he turned his attention to frequent MAGA target Ilhan Omar. \n\nWalz turned the attention back to Trump’s own mental acuity with his brief clap-back. \n\nPosting a screenshot of Trump’s rant to his X account, Kamala Harris’ former running mate responding with “release the MRI results” in reference to the president’s recent test. \n\nEarlier in November, Trump said he received a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exam as part of his recent physical, saying it was “very standard”. \n\n“Getting an MRI is very standard.

Robert Garcia of Long Beach could represent conservative Orange County cities if reelected","text":"A day after California voters passed Proposition 50, Rep. Robert Garcia, a Democrat from Long Beach whose district stands to gain more Republican voters than any other House member under the new congressional maps, pledged to represent all constituents in what will be California’s new 42nd Congressional District if he’s reelected.\n\n“Regardless of political parties — I’ll represent everyone. And there’s great people and neighborhoods all across the new district,” Garcia wrote in a Nov. 5 social media post.\n\nThe hoopla surrounding the 42nd Congressional District isn’t just that Garcia will be running in an area that will look vastly different from what it does today.\n\nIt’s that the openly gay, progressive liberal who, up to this point, has represented a heavily Democratic district in deep-blue Los Angeles County, would be the lawmaker for some of Orange County’s most conservative coastal communities, including Huntington Beach and part of Newport Beach, if reelected.\n\nIn 2023, the Huntington Beach City Council voted to allow only government and various military flags to fly on city-owned property. Critics viewed the ban on non-government banners as a way to keep the Pride flag — a symbol for the LGBTQ+ community — from being displayed.\n\nAnd the city, where all seven City Council members are Republicans, is also where President Donald Trump received over 9,500 more votes than former Vice President Kamala Harris during last year’s presidential election, according to the California secretary of state’s office.\n\nTrump also won in Newport Beach, where he received over 8,300 more votes than Harris last year. (Trump ultimately lost not only California but also Orange County as a whole in 2024.)\n\nGarcia, on the other hand, has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration. As the ranking member on the House Oversight Committee, he’s relentlessly pursued the full release of the Jeffrey Epstein files. And just this week, he led a congressional hearing into alleged misconduct by federal immigration agents carrying out Trump’s mass deportation policy.\n\nAlthough voters in Huntington Beach and Newport Beach tend to be more conservative than Long Beach, Garcia said there are still plenty of people who care about issues that he also finds important.\n\n“Yes, there’s a lot more conservative folks here,” Garcia acknowledged over a lunch of salmon fish tacos and iced tea at Duke’s restaurant in Huntington Beach this week. “There’s also a ton of Democrats and progressives here.”\n\n“And,” Garcia continued, “there’s a ton of people that are independent that oppose Donald Trump’s plan to open up the Huntington Beach coast, the Newport (Beach) coast, the Seal Beach coast to new oil rigs. Those are issues that we’re going to hopefully find common ground on.”\n\nCurrently, the 42nd Congressional District, which Garcia was first elected to represent in 2022, lies entirely within L.A. County. It stretches north from Long Beach and includes some communities in southeast L.A. County, including Lakewood, Downey and Huntington Park.\n\nBut under the new map expected to take effect with next year’s midterm elections, the district would lose those communities in southeast L.A. County and instead swing south, picking up at least portions of Seal Beach, Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa in Orange County.\n\nThe current 42nd Congressional District includes 53% registered Democratic voters as well as 18% Republican voters and 23% no party preference or other. With next year’s changes, the district will include 40% registered Democratic voters, 30% Republican and 28% no party preference or other.\n\nIt’s not that the Orange County cities that will be folded into the 42nd Congressional District haven’t been represented by a Democrat before.\n\nTheir current congressmember, Rep. Dave Min of Irvine, is a Democrat. So was Katie Porter, who served before Min.\n\nBut as Huntington Beach Mayor Pat Burns puts it: Porter and Min were elected based on a congressional map drawn by an independent redistricting commission and under a nonpartisan system that California voters previously approved.\n\nYet that’s just one issue Burns has about Huntington Beach possibly being represented by Garcia under the new map. He’s also worried that Garcia’s ideas for the city won’t align with what residents truly want.\n\nOver the summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom and other Democrats proposed a mid-decade redistricting effort to position California Democrats to pick up five additional House seats in the 2026 midterm elections as a counter to similar gerrymandering efforts by GOP-led states.\n\nThat effort led to voters adopting new, gerrymandered maps for California in a special election a few weeks ago. The maps are being challenged in court as unconstitutional by California Republicans and the U.S. Department of Justice.\n\nIn the meantime, Republicans in some of Orange County’s more conservative, lower-density communities continue to balk at the idea of being lumped into the same district as Long Beach, a much more liberal, urban community in L.A. County.\n\nGarcia is well aware that his political views and the views of some of his potentially new constituents won’t always line up.\n\nHis strategy is to find areas of common interest upon which he’d advocate for, such as coastal preservation, investments in infrastructure and support for small local businesses.\n\n“We’re not always going to agree on every issue, and that’s fine,” he said.\n\nBut, Garcia said, “I want Huntington Beach, Newport, Seal, communities on the coast to look back and say, ‘Damn, Robert Garcia is bringing us more federal resources to help our budgets than anyone we’ve ever had,’” he said.\n\nHuntington Beach Mayor Pro Tem Casey McKeon, who will be sworn in as mayor next week, said many residents in the city remain skeptical about representation under the new congressional maps.\n\nHe did not want to speculate who would win the 42nd Congressional District race next year but said he’s willing to keep an open mind should Garcia be elected to represent Huntington Beach.\n\n“It doesn’t matter who the representative is,” said McKeon. “We would expect our congressional representative to work on projects that affect Huntington Beach.”\n\nFor example, he hopes whoever is elected to represent the city after the midterm elections will advocate for federal funding for sand replenishment projects.\n\n“It shouldn’t matter (the) political lines,” he said. “I hope to have a good relationship with our representative in Congress.”\n\nBurns, the outgoing mayor of Huntington Beach, is wary that being lumped into the same congressional district as Long Beach will mean that voters there will overshadow those from smaller communities and likely elect someone with a more urban mindset.\n\nLong Beach is the seventh most populous city in California, with some neighborhoods boasting mid-rise and high-rise apartments and condos. That sort of high-density living is a stark contrast to Huntington Beach, Burns said.\n\n“Long Beach is quite different,” Burns said. “Is he (Garcia) going to represent us in a Huntington Beach manner, or does he have his own ideals of what he thinks Huntington Beach should be? We’re obviously more conservative than he has shown. Hopefully, he will be respectful of those values and help us live those values.”\n\nAlthough Burns was an officer with the Long Beach Police Department when Garcia was mayor, it’s been a long time since the two have crossed paths, both men said.\n\n“We have different political perspectives, but I respect his service as a Long Beach police officer,” Garcia said.\n\nThe congressmember also said that some of his college friends now live in Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa, and he considers himself fairly familiar with what will be the new 42nd Congressional District.\n\nIn addition, he said he’s been to the homes of some Huntington Beach residents who invited him to meet with small business owners and community members to hear their perspectives.\n\nHaving served on the Long Beach City Council and as mayor there for eight years before being elected to Congress, Garcia said he understands the fiscal challenges local municipalities face and that basic quality-of-life issues like sidewalk maintenance still matter. He intends to advocate on such issues, he said.\n\nJust don’t expect the congressmember to pull a 180 on his political stances, whether it’s about LGBTQ+ rights or other core values.\n\n“If people are being attacked, if communities are being marginalized, it’s my place to speak up. I’m not going to shy from that,” he said.\n\nGarcia said if he is reelected, he’d represent “some very wealthy communities,” yet he continues to believe billionaires and large corporations shouldn’t get tax breaks while average citizens struggle to pay their rent.\n\n“I always vote what I believe is the right thing for the communities I represent, for our state and for what I believe in,” Garcia said.\n\nAt the same time, he said he respects the fact that not everyone shares his opinions. He’s spent his career working with people with differing views, he said, and expects that to continue even if he represents more conservative communities.\n\n“I’ve worked with Republicans my whole life,” he said. “I’m actually not worried about it at all.”","summary":"The new 42nd Congressional District will include OC communities of Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Costa Mesa under redistricting map.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/11/28/democratic-rep-robert-garcia-of-long-beach-could-represent-conservative-orange-county-cities-if-reelected/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LDN-L-ROBERT-GARCIA-1127-JG-02.jpg?w=150&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 16:22:26","author":"Gqlshare,Linh Tat","authors":["Gqlshare","Linh Tat"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.006},{"id":383164056,"title":"Trump targets Walz with slur, attacks Omar and Somali community","text":"In an invective posted to the Truth Social platform on Thanksgiving, President Trump used a slur for people with intellectual disabilities to describe Minnesota Gov.

Ilhan Omar.\n\nTrump began his post with a familiar mix of gratitude and outrage. “A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed at,” he wrote, before blaming “foolish countries throughout the World” and the rise of “Political Correctness” for America’s woes on immigration.\n\nTrump also noted how the United States now has “an official Foreign population” of 53 million people, according to the census, and asserted that “most… are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.” He suggested that hardworking Americans are footing the bill for “massive payments” to those “supported through massive payments from Patriotic American Citizens who, because of their beautiful hearts, do not want to openly complain or cause trouble.”\n\n\"They put up with what has happened to our Country, but it’s eating them alive to do so!\" he wrote. \"A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family.\"\n\nTrump even accused the federal government of masking the true scale of the nation’s immigration crisis, saying, “The real migrant population is much higher.” He warned that this “refugee burden is the leading cause of social dysfunction in America,” pointing to issues like “failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing shortages, and large deficits.”\n\nRecommended: What Charlie Kirk Said About Biden’s Afghan Refugee Crisis Has New Meaning Today\n\nThen came the part that has set social media ablaze. Trump zeroed in on Minnesota, saying the state has been “completely taken over” by “hundreds of thousands of refugees from Somalia.” He painted a grim picture of “Somalian gangs… roving the streets looking for ‘prey’ as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone.”\n\nThe president didn’t stop there. He blasted Kamala Harris’s former running mate.\n\nThe seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst “Congressman/woman” in our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when her place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military, Police, schools, etc…\n\nSay what you want about Trump’s messaging, but it was classic Trump. Naturally, social media is abuzz, with many of his supporters hailing the post for its blunt message, and others could hardly believe he said what he did about Walz. Something tells me that Trump doesn’t care. And after someone shot and nearly killed him last year, why would he?","url":"https://pjmedia.com/matt-margolis/2025/11/28/can-you-believe-donald-trump-said-this-about-tim-walz-n4946491","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/329/89e901be-7f7a-4f4c-87ac-95481518756e.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 14:45:00","author":"Matt Margolis","authors":["Matt Margolis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.153},{"id":383108652,"title":"Jennifer Lopez cooks Thanksgiving meal with child Emme inside $52M Bel Air mansion she used to share with Ben Affleck but is struggling to sell","text":"Home and Garden\n\nBlack Friday\n\nKim Kardashian\n\nVictoria Beckham\n\nHarry Styles\n\nAmanda Holden\n\nPrivacy Policy\n\nFriday, Nov 28th 2025\n\n5-Day Forecast\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRachel Reeves 'lied to Brits about £21bn black hole to justify Benefits Street tax raid on workers' - and knew the UK actually had a £4bn SURPLUS\n\nThe tender family moment captured just minutes before Brit father, 28, died in jetski crash in front of his loving partner and baby in Dubai\n\nTrump 'is set to recognise Russian control over Crimea and other occupied Ukrainian territories in bid to secure deal with Putin to end war'\n\nRevealed: The new diet that exactly mimics weight-loss jabs - allowing you to shed kilos super fast WITHOUT costly Mounjaro and its embarrassing side-effects.

I've invited him but he doesn't want to show up,' Trump claimed. Trump and Biden's first presidential debate last year, before the latter pulled out and Kamala Harris replaced him as the Democratic nominee, teetered off the rails when they traded jabs over their golf games. \n\nAnswering questions from CNN moderator Dana Bash about concerns voters have expressed about their age, the pair's bickering descended into Trump and Biden engaging in a standoff over their handicaps.\n\nTrump has previously made boasting claims about his golfing success, bragging that he has won multiple club championships. \n\nAnd he doubled down on his claims on Thursday as he insisted that they were all legitimate victories - despite past accusations of cheating against the president. \n\n'I know a lot about golf. I've won 38 golf championships and I don't get to practice very much,' he continued. \n\n'I won one last year. I won a club championship, beating a 27-year-old kid. I said 'You know, I'm decades older than you but the fairway doesn't know how old you are,' as you walk up the middle and he's in the rough. \n\n'I've been a good golfer over the years. Club championships are our majors. I've won 38 of them, every one of them legitimately. It has to be legitimate because you have a lot of people following you with club championships.' \n\nHe went on to claim that he has a 'very low handicap' but dodged around providing a definitive number. \n\n'I guess I'm very - I got to be right around scratch or better. I beat a plus-three. That's three better, three below par. If you look at it for those that don't know, in the finals of the club championship last year, with all I was going through and with no practice. So, I'm a good golfer.' \n\nTrump has been frequently accused of cheating and liberally interpreting the rules on the golf course. \n\nRick Reilly's book, 'Commander in Cheat', published in 2019, examines the president's apparent penchant for cheating in golf.\n\n'Trump doesn't just cheat at golf,' Reilly wrote in an excerpt published by Golf.com . 'He cheats like a three-card Monte dealer. He throws it, boots it, and moves it.\n\n'He lies about his lies. He fudges and foozles and fluffs. At Winged Foot, where Trump is a member, the caddies got so used to seeing him kick his ball back onto the fairway they came up with a nickname for him: 'Pele.'\n\nEarlier this year, film star Samuel L. Jackson also accused him of cheating when the pair played a round together.\n\nHowever, MLB legend Roger Clemens appeared to defend the president when they played a round together in the summer. \n\nClemens and Trump played at the latter's Trump National Golf Club in Virginia with the baseball star's son, Kacy, and the club's director of golf, John O'Leary, per the Daily Beast .\n\nThe former New York Yankee shared a photo of the group's scorecard and while Trump shot a respectable 77, he still finished behind the other three players in his group.\n\nKacy, 31, shot a 69, O'Leary wasn't far behind with a 71 and Clemens finished one stroke ahead of Trump with a 76.\n\n'For everyone asking about the scorecard! Mr. President didn't miss a fairway!!,' he said.","summary":"President Donald Trump was seemingly thankful for his golf game on Thursday as he spent Thanksgiving detailing his many achievements on the course, including one outlandish boast.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/golf/article-15333881/trump-golf-claim-joe-biden.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/28/14/104267937-0-image-m-18_1764339423000.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 14:18:44","author":"Editor,Isabel Baldwin","authors":["Editor","Isabel Baldwin"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.198},{"id":383096412,"title":"The Mooch is selling a $49 online course to Gen Z on how to survive failure","text":"Ousted White House official and financier Anthony Scaramucci is selling a $49 course for young professionals about how to survive failure - something he knows a bit about. \n\nScaramucci, also known as “The Mooch,” has created “The Resilience Lab,” a video course that advertises itself as helping young people turn their biggest failures into their “most valuable assets.” The project, which launched this month, is aimed at Gen-Z professionals, according to Bloomberg.\n\nScaramucci’s latest endeavor comes after he survived a series of career failures himself, including being ousted as President Donald Trump’s communications director in 2017 after holding the job for just 11 days.\n\nHe was removed from the role shortly after going on an expletive-laden rant about other White House officials in an interview with The New Yorker. Two years later, Trump called Scaramucci a “highly unstable ‘nut job’” and claimed he “barely knew him until his 11 days of gross incompetence.” \n\nScaramucci has since appeared to cut ties with the MAGA world. The 61-year-old labelled Trump a “grifter” in 2023 and endorsed former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nOther career setbacks included early Bitcoin losses and a former business partnership with Sam Bankman-Fried, a convicted crypto fraudster, Bloomberg reported. \n\nScaramucci outlined the past setbacks on the Resilience Lab website, writing that his failures have helped inform the $49 course.\n\n“I failed the bar exam twice after graduating from Harvard Law School,” the website reads. “I was fired from the White House after just 11 days and became a global punchline. I’ve been praised as a genius and caricatured as a failure in the press.”\n\n“Each time, I got back up, learned the lesson and came back stronger. This course is the sum of that scar tissue. Now I use what I've learned to give young professionals the playbook I never had.”\n\nScaramucci cites his failures throughout the course. In one video about the importance of projecting confidence, he recalled the public humiliation of being fired from the White House. \n\n“I get fired in such a spectacular way that I’m parodied on Saturday Night Live, I'm lit up by all the late-night comedians, and I'm destroyed by all the cable news pundits,” Scaramucci recalled. “So when you talk about getting fired, on the 31st of July, 2017, I was blown through the front door of the White House, skinned alive and then rolled in Margarita salt. It was an absolutely miserable feeling.”\n\nIn the course, Scaramucci teaches Gen-Z professionals how to “own your mistakes” and project “unshakeable security,” according to the Resilience Lab website. The website features photos of Scaramucci from throughout his career, including a shot from the White House briefing room. \n\n“It’s the best investment you will ever make in your own career, and it will help you avoid the mistakes that took me decades to learn,” Scaramucci said in a video advertising the course.\n\nScaramucci’s course includes five modules, which cover topics including “how to be comfortable with rejection and stay in the game” and “how to manage your ego so it doesn't kill your career,” according to the website. It’s also free for those who can’t afford the course.\n\n“There’s no course in high school, there’s no course in college that teaches this,” Scaramucci told Bloomberg.\n\nThe Independent has contacted Scaramucci for comment.","summary":"The ex-Trump official says he became a ‘global punchline,’ and now wants to coach young professionals","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/anthony-scaramucci-gen-z-failure-course-b2872345.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/25/17/01/GettyImages-820353314.jpg?crop=3000,2000,x0,y0&trim=0,0,0,0&width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/tD78ah3A-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-28 13:58:38","author":"Katie Hawkinson","authors":["Katie Hawkinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":383086630,"title":"Michael Barone: Dick Cheney: Always Unintimidated","text":"The word that best describes how former Vice President Dick Cheney, who wielded the responsibilities he undertook in public affairs over a long career, began improbably early in life and extended into years of repudiation by his fellow partisans, is “unintimidated.”\n\nHe was unintimidated by his rise to become White House chief of staff at age 34 in 1975, after flunking out of Yale University and not finishing his Ph.D. at the University of Wisconsin (while his wife, Lynne Cheney, earned hers).\n\nCheney, who died early this month and was eulogized in a ceremony to which the current president and vice president were not invited, rose after being awarded an American Political Science Association fellowship in Washington. There, he favorably impressed two bosses who were elected to Congress at ages 28 and 30 — William Steiger, who, before his death at age 40, pushed a capital gains tax cut through a 2-1 Democratic House, and Donald Rumsfeld, who became former President Richard Nixon’s antipoverty program chief and former President Gerald Ford’s chief of staff.\n\nStill in his 30s, Cheney remained unintimidated by the travails of his patrons and his country — the forced resignation of Nixon in August 1974, the evacuation of U.S. troops from the embassy in Saigon in April 1975, the unveiling of Ford’s WIN (Whip Inflation Now) buttons in October 1974. He seemed no more impressed than intimidated by his West Wing office near the president’s, nor his duties dealing with eminences such as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.\n\nAlthough Ford trailed far behind in polls, he nearly won a full term in 1976: if he had gotten 11,117 more votes in Ohio and 14,464 in Mississippi, he would have had 272 electoral votes to former President Jimmy Carter’s 265. Cheney returned to his native Wyoming and, undaunted by voters who expected to meet and grill candidates for high office in person, won election to the state’s sole House seat in 1978.\n\nHe was undaunted as well by what many regarded as inevitable American decline. I remember a conversation shortly after Reagan’s inauguration in 1981, in which he expressed worry about overcoming Soviet advances abroad and budget deficits and stagflation at home. As a Reagan backer, during the Iran-Contra affair, he defended the administration’s right to conduct foreign policy — a harbinger of future stands in future controversies — and he was elected House minority whip after former President George H. W. Bush was elected in 1988.\n\nBush’s unexpected failure to get John Tower, a fellow Texan, confirmed as defense secretary had two pivotal consequences. One was the naming of Cheney, at age 48, as defense secretary. The other was the election by an 87-85 margin of Newt Gingrich, 46, to succeed Cheney as whip, which put him in line to push aside former Minority Leader Robert Michel and lead Republicans to their first House majority in 40 years in 1994. Whether Cheney’s talents would have produced that result is uncertain; in any case, Republicans have won House majorities in three-quarters of the elections since.\n\nMore immediately consequential was Cheney’s appointment. Unintimidated, despite his lack of military service, he assembled Operation Desert Shield and coolly fired the Air Force chief of staff for an unauthorized interview on the eve of Operation Desert Storm. His White House, congressional and national security experience made him a natural choice as head of former President George W. Bush’s vice presidential selection committee and, after due consultation, for the vice presidential nomination itself.\n\nOnly four men served eight years as vice president before 1950; three made well-known comments about the insignificance of the office, and the fourth was known for his alcoholism. But since 1950, there have been five vice presidents who served eight years; three of them (Nixon, H.W. Bush and Joe Biden) were later elected president in their own right, and a fourth (Al Gore) won the popular vote for the office.\n\nCheney was the odd man out, yet he was arguably the most consequential vice president of the five. After the 9/11 attacks, he pressed hard for aggressive measures to protect America from terrorism, arguing that enhanced interrogations and military action to remove the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq were justified if there was even a 1% chance of preventing a terrorist attack that, in a nuclear age, could have been orders of magnitude greater than 9/11. He acted on this conviction, unintimidated by the prospect of widespread opposition and of a decline that, in fact, occurred in his job approval.\n\nIn most ideological quarters, Cheney’s recommendations, implemented with W. Bush’s substantial but not total approval, were, if not a crime, then a blunder. But even if, as in all wars, mistakes were made, “regime change in Baghdad also brought blessings,” wrote The Wall Street Journal’s Barton Swaim.\n\nBuilding on those blessings has been, ironically, President Donald Trump, who has routinely called the Iraq War a mistake and has been full of scorn for Cheney. Yet it is impossible to imagine the success of Trump’s Abraham Accords and bombing of Iran’s nuclear facilities if the Hussein regime were still in place; history may record it was necessary to take out the terrorist regime in Iraq before taking out the terrorist regime in Iran. Trump’s successful foreign policies may owe more to Cheney than either would feel comfortable admitting.\n\nCheney was no orator but performed ably in his two vice presidential debates, in 2000 against Joe Lieberman, whom he liked and admired, and in 2004 against John Edwards, whose smarmy phoniness he despised. In that contest, Cheney was the first major party nominee to support same-sex marriage — long before Biden, former President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton — and he gave unintimidated support to his daughter Mary Cheney and her wife and their children.\n\nHe gave unintimidated support as well to his daughter Liz Cheney, who, as a former Wyoming representative and member of the Republican leadership, opposed Trump’s course of action on Jan. 6 and supported his impeachment, conduct that I wrote at the time “any reasonable person could find impeachable.” That led to the Cheneys’ otherwise surprising endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris last year.\n\nLet me close on a personal note. When I ran into Cheney, he often recalled playing high school football for Casper against Worland quarterback Grant Ujifusa, who later created “The Almanac of American Politics” and enlisted me as a coauthor. With both now gone, I can’t help thinking that playing high school football on cold — maybe freezing — Wyoming fall Friday evenings may leave you unintimidated by anything you face later.\n\nCOPYRIGHT 2025 CREATORS.COM","url":"https://patriotpost.us/opinion/123114-dick-cheney-always-unintimidated-2025-11-28","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01GR4QNK1K7PV7B16TYRNJ89RV.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 12:48:03","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.125},{"id":383069568,"title":"Trump rages over ‘seriously retarded Governor’ Tim Walz in furious Thanksgiving message","text":"President Trump ripped Minnesota Gov.

Still, Trump’s call for Republican-run states to overhaul their House maps to keep Democrats out of power has blown past the usual norms about when and how redistricting happens. Democrats have launched their own map-drawing pushes in response, sparking political and legal battles nationwide that will influence the 2026 playing field and help decide who ends up running Congress. \n\n“The story of the race for the House has been dominated by mid-cycle redistricting to such a degree that it has been challenging to assess the overall state of play, with new developments popping up almost daily,” said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.\n\nHow states handle redistricting varies widely. In some states, lawmakers can simply rewrite the lines if they have the votes. In others, any overhaul requires a constitutional change, a slower path that typically sends the decision directly to voters. Here’s a look at which states have finished their maps, which ones are tied up in court, and where new players could still emerge.\n\nStates that approved new maps\n\nTexas ignited the mid-cycle scramble by approving a map aimed at flipping five Democratic districts, two in South Texas, one each in Dallas and Houston, and another running between Austin and San Antonio. However, a federal court put the brakes on the plan, stating that the new lines likely constitute an unconstitutional racial gerrymander and directed the state to revert to its earlier map for now. \n\nThe state is now asking the Supreme Court to intervene in a fight that has a fast-approaching deadline: Texas candidates for Congress must file for their chosen districts by Dec. 8. \n\nRep. Julie Johnson (D-TX) said the uncertainty has left candidates and voters in limbo. “It’s like a ping pong ball going back and forth,” she said in an interview on CNN, arguing the lower court’s ruling was clear and that mid-cycle map changes create “too much uncertainty in the process.” She added that voters expect fairness and stability, not constant shifts in district lines driven by political winds.\n\nRepublicans have defended the map in court by denying that the new lines were a racial gerrymander.\n\nCalifornia became the first Democratic-run state to answer Trump’s call for new maps. Voters approved a congressional overhaul on Nov. 4 that scraps the lines drawn by the state’s independent commission after the 2020 census and replaces them with a plan expected to give Democrats a shot at as many as five more seats. \n\nThe map aims to effectively wipe out potential gains from the new Republican map in Texas. The party currently controls 43 of the state’s 52 districts. The Justice Department has now sided with Republicans in a lawsuit challenging the new boundaries.\n\nMissouri followed Texas as the second Republican state to redraw its House lines at Trump’s urging. Kehoe signed the new map on Sept. 28, targeting a Democratic-held Kansas City district in hopes of flipping another seat. Republicans now hold six of eight. Opponents are pursuing lawsuits and collecting signatures for a potential referendum.\n\nNorth Carolina became the third GOP-controlled state to move ahead with the kind of map changes Trump has been urging. On Oct. 22, the Republican-led legislature signed off on a congressional redraw that reconfigures a Democratic district in the eastern part of the state, potentially giving the GOP another seat. The plan does not require the governor’s sign-off. Republicans now hold 10 of 14 seats, and the new map is already the subject of a lawsuit.\n\nOhio’s redistricting commission, nominally bipartisan but firmly controlled by Republicans, unexpectedly approved a deal that puts two Democratic incumbents, Marcy Kaptur in the northwest and Greg Landsman in Cincinnati, in tougher districts. Rep. Emilia Sykes’ district, meanwhile, becomes more favorable to Democrats. The state was required to redraw its congressional map because the previous GOP-drawn lines were enacted without any Democratic support, triggering a redo under Ohio law.\n\nIn Utah, a state judge threw out the existing congressional map, finding it ran afoul of the state’s voter-approved anti-gerrymandering rules, and instead put in place a new plan that forms a compact, Democratic-leaning district around Salt Lake City. Her decision overrode the map passed by the GOP-controlled legislature, which would have made it far harder for Democrats to compete. Gov. Spencer Cox said he intends to bring lawmakers back for a special session next month, as Republican legislators push a constitutional amendment aimed at reaffirming their authority to revise voter-approved ballot measures.\n\nThe decision also prompted the first public break in silence from Utah’s congressional delegation. Rep. Burgess Owens (R-UT), whose district would lose significant territory under the new map, sharply criticized Judge Dianna Gibson’s ruling, accusing her of overstepping. “It is painful to watch a Utah judge abandon the restraint, balance, and humility that our system depends upon,” he wrote, arguing she had “commandeered” the mapmaking authority that should rest with elected lawmakers. Owens said her decision imposed “an outcome that was never chosen by the people,” framing it as a disruption to a system that had functioned for “more than a century.”\n\nStates moving toward revised maps\n\nIn Virginia, Democrats are pushing a multi-step effort that would shift redistricting power from the state’s bipartisan commission to the legislature starting next year. The commission deadlocked after the 2020 census, leaving a court to draw the current lines, and Democrats want a new process that gives lawmakers control. Their proposal cleared the General Assembly in late October but must pass again after the 2025 elections before going to voters for final approval. If enacted, a revised map would likely put three GOP-held districts in the crosshairs.\n\nAnalysts say the stakes are enormous. As David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report put it, “There’s a ton of upside for Democrats in the Old Dominion,” noting that even modest line changes could flip multiple GOP districts.\n\nLouisiana has pushed its primary calendar back, with Gov. Jeff Landry signing a bill in October that shifts the date from April 18 to May 16. The move is intended to give lawmakers more time to revise the state’s congressional lines if the U.S. Supreme Court strikes down the current map. Republicans hold four of the six seats.\n\nMaryland remains one of the simplest places for Democrats to try adding a seat to their column. With complete control of the state government, they could redraw the lines in a way that jeopardizes Rep. Andy Harris, the lone Republican in the delegation. However, a similar effort was rejected by a state court after the last census. This time around, the state Senate’s Democratic leader has signaled reluctance to reopen the maps, but Gov. Wes Moore is moving forward with a commission tasked with producing new proposals.\n\nStates weighing mid-cycle changes\n\nThe Indiana General Assembly is now poised to reopen the redistricting fight in December, a reversal that came after both Trump and Vice President JD Vance urged GOP lawmakers to push ahead with a new congressional map. The proposal on the table would likely wipe out both Democratic-held districts and deliver Republicans a 9–0 delegation.\n\nJust days earlier, Trump’s effort appeared to be going nowhere, with the state Senate signaling it had no plans to return before the year’s end. And while senators have now agreed to reconvene, the outcome still hinges on whether enough of them ultimately support the plan. Without those votes, it won’t reach Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.\n\n“The issue of redrawing Indiana’s congressional maps mid-cycle has received a lot of attention and is causing strife here in our state,” Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray said in a statement. “To resolve this issue, the Senate intends to reconvene as part of the regular 2026 session on Dec. 8 and make a final decision that week on any redistricting proposal sent from the House.”\n\nIn Florida, Republicans opened the door to possible mid-cycle redistricting by creating a House committee to study the issue, a move that could lead to new lines in a state where the GOP currently holds 20 of 28 congressional seats.\n\nIn Illinois, House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) has been urging state lawmakers to revisit their congressional map, but there’s little indication they intend to reopen the process. The current lines already give Democrats a strong advantage, though another redraw could be used to squeeze out one additional GOP-held district.\n\nColorado could soon join the list of states eyeing mid-cycle map changes. Attorney General Phil Weiser, now running for governor, is urging Democrats to craft an “in case of emergency” ballot measure for 2026 that would temporarily hand redistricting power to the legislature for the 2028 cycle before restoring authority to the state’s independent commission. Gov. Jared Polis, who is finishing his final term, has shown little interest in bypassing the commission, but Weiser argues that Democratic voters are increasingly open to the idea as more Republican-led states press ahead with their own redraws.\n\nIn New York, Democratic lawmakers have introduced a constitutional amendment that would permit mid-decade redistricting. To advance, it must pass the Legislature in two consecutive sessions before appearing on the statewide ballot. Democrats currently hold 19 of the state’s 26 House seats.\n\nKansas Republicans quietly backed away from their attempt to trigger a special redistricting session this fall, unable to muster enough support without Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s cooperation. But the fight is only paused. Once the Legislature returns in January, GOP leaders are expected to renew their push to redraw the map, a move that would almost certainly center on making Rep. Sharice Davids’s Kansas City–area seat harder for Democrats to hold. \n\nNebraska Gov. Jim Pillen has signaled he’s “open” to revisiting the state’s congressional map, but no formal push has materialized. Any midcycle redraw wouldn’t add a new GOP seat, but it could fortify the Omaha-area 2nd District, a swing seat Kamala Harris carried in 2024 and currently held by retiring Rep. Don Bacon (R-NE).\n\nDemocrats are only three seats away from reclaiming the House. While Trump is banking on GOP-led redraws to counter the usual midterm drag, the overall battlefield still hasn’t shifted decisively in his favor. “Democrats do remain favored to win the House next year,” Kondik said, even after months of mid-cycle changes and with several major states still weighing new maps. \n\nHe noted that only an unusually early Supreme Court ruling on the Voting Rights Act could fundamentally alter the landscape, but its timing is unpredictable and likely too late to matter for the 2026 elections. With potential redraws still looming in places such as Florida, Virginia, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, and Illinois, control of the House will ultimately hinge on just a handful of seats.","summary":"A coast-to-coast redistricting arms race ignited by President Donald Trump has plunged states into a frenzied, mid-cycle scramble that will help determine whether&#160;Republicans&#160;can maintain their narrow House majority in 2026.

As I mentioned yesterday, I'll be rerunning \"Best Of\" editions of the Morning Briefing a few times during the holiday season. Hey, even I need to overindulge and spend time with loved ones. Here's the MB from the day after the election last. A time of Thanksgiving indeed.)\n\nTop O' the Briefing\n\nHappy, happy Wednesday, dear Kruiser Morning Briefing friends. \n\nWhat a night. \n\nThis election celebration edition of the Briefing will be a bit different. There aren't a lot of links because there is really only one story today. The pre-election posts are already obsolete. \n\nAlso, I was busy with yet another PJ Media epic live blog until the wee hours of the morning my time. They're always a lot of fun, but last night's was obviously special. Thousands of people, thousands of comments, a good time was had by all. It was like being at a watch party without having to shower or smell other people. \n\nThere was, of course, a lot of tension and anxiety at the beginning of the night. Because of the Democrats' relentless assault on election transparency and integrity — especially in recent years — faith in the system has been severely shaken. Any good news in the early going was difficult to get excited about because we were all waiting for news of \"irregularities\" to start coming in. \n\nRegular readers here know that I have been nothing but pessimistic throughout this election cycle. I knew that all of the signs looked good for Trump as Election Day approached, but I was convinced that the Dems would find some way to blow it all up. Pennsylvania was the biggest surprise for me. I was convinced that the Magic Mail-In Ballot Machine in Philadelphia would muck up the works. \n\nIt was not to be a night when the Dems' attempts to put their thumbs on the scales would work, however.\n\nThat's because Trump was over-performing everywhere, even in blue states. New Jersey and Virginia were closer than anyone expected. He was cutting into traditional Democratic constituencies all over the place. The Dem electorate seemed to quickly remember that it didn't like Kamala Harris very much in the 2020 primaries. \n\nIn the end, his numbers were too strong for the Democrats to pull any of their stunts. The New York Times was predicting that he would win the popular vote almost before any other news organization. It was that kind of night. At one point, before CNN had called the race for Trump, Jake Tapper asked John King what they were waiting for. King replied, \"Just to see how big the shellacking will be.\"\n\nOne thing I noticed about the CNN coverage is that most of them didn't seem terribly upset. They were definitely caught off-guard in 2016, which is why they had such emotional on-air meltdowns. They were quite prepared for what happened last night. \n\nThere will be plenty to write about in the coming days regarding the media's awfulness. There are a lot of lessons to be learned from this election, and the leftists in the MSM will fail to figure any of it out. \n\nToday, let us all revel in the fact that Donald Trump just pulled the Republic back from the brink of commie disaster. \n\nAnd he did it bigly. \n\nEverything Isn't Awful\n\nCats are on another level.. 😨 pic.twitter.com/9ZT779FuZu— Buitengebieden (@buitengebieden) November 5, 2024\n\nMAGA ALL OVER THE PLACE.

There, he favorably impressed two bosses who were elected to Congress at ages 28 and 30 -- William Steiger, who, before his death at age 40, pushed a capital gains tax cut through a 2-1 Democratic House, and Donald Rumsfeld, who became former President Richard Nixon's antipoverty program chief and former President Gerald Ford's chief of staff.\n\nStill in his 30s, Cheney remained unintimidated by the travails of his patrons and his country -- the forced resignation of Nixon in August 1974, the evacuation of U.S. troops from the embassy in Saigon in April 1975, the unveiling of Ford's WIN (Whip Inflation Now) buttons in October 1974. He seemed no more impressed than intimidated by his West Wing office near the president's, nor his duties dealing with eminences such as former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.\n\nAlthough Ford trailed far behind in polls, he nearly won a full term in 1976: if he had gotten 11,117 more votes in Ohio and 14,464 in Mississippi, he would have had 272 electoral votes to former President Jimmy Carter's 265. Cheney returned to his native Wyoming and, undaunted by voters who expected to meet and grill candidates for high office in person, won election to the state's sole House seat in 1978.\n\nHe was undaunted as well by what many regarded as inevitable American decline. I remember a conversation shortly after Reagan's inauguration in 1981, in which he expressed worry about overcoming Soviet advances abroad and budget deficits and stagflation at home. As a Reagan backer, during the Iran-Contra affair, he defended the administration's right to conduct foreign policy -- a harbinger of future stands in future controversies -- and he was elected House minority whip after former President George H. W. Bush was elected in 1988.\n\nBush's unexpected failure to get John Tower, a fellow Texan, confirmed as defense secretary had two pivotal consequences. One was the naming of Cheney, at age 48, as defense secretary. The other was the election by an 87-85 margin of Newt Gingrich, 46, to succeed Cheney as whip, which put him in line to push aside former Minority Leader Robert Michel and lead Republicans to their first House majority in 40 years in 1994. Whether Cheney's talents would have produced that result is uncertain; in any case, Republicans have won House majorities in three-quarters of the elections since.\n\nMore immediately consequential was Cheney's appointment. Unintimidated, despite his lack of military service, he assembled Operation Desert Shield and coolly fired the Air Force chief of staff for an unauthorized interview on the eve of Operation Desert Storm. His White House, congressional and national security experience made him a natural choice as head of former President George W. Bush's vice presidential selection committee and, after due consultation, for the vice presidential nomination itself.\n\nOnly four men served eight years as vice president before 1950; three made well-known comments about the insignificance of the office, and the fourth was known for his alcoholism. But since 1950, there have been five vice presidents who served eight years; three of them (Nixon, H.W. Bush and Joe Biden) were later elected president in their own right, and a fourth (Al Gore) won the popular vote for the office.\n\nCheney was the odd man out, yet he was arguably the most consequential vice president of the five. After the 9/11 attacks, he pressed hard for aggressive measures to protect America from terrorism, arguing that enhanced interrogations and military action to remove the Saddam Hussein regime in Iraq were justified if there was even a one percent chance of preventing a terrorist attack that, in a nuclear age, could have been orders of magnitude greater than 9/11. He acted on this conviction, unintimidated by the prospect of widespread opposition and of a decline that, in fact, occurred in his job approval.\n\nIn most ideological quarters, Cheney's recommendations, implemented with W. Bush's substantial but not total approval, were, if not a crime, then a blunder. But even if, as in all wars, mistakes were made, \"regime change in Baghdad also brought blessings,\" wrote The Wall Street Journal's Barton Swaim.\n\nBuilding on those blessings has been, ironically, President Donald Trump, who has routinely called the Iraq War a mistake and has been full of scorn for Cheney. Yet it is impossible to imagine the success of Trump's Abraham Accords and bombing of Iran's nuclear facilities if the Hussein regime were still in place; history may record it was necessary to take out the terrorist regime in Iraq before taking out the terrorist regime in Iran. Trump's successful foreign policies may owe more to Cheney than either would feel comfortable admitting.\n\nCheney was no orator but performed ably in his two vice presidential debates, in 2000 against Joe Lieberman, whom he liked and admired, and in 2004 against John Edwards, whose smarmy phoniness he despised. In that contest, Cheney was the first major party nominee to support same-sex marriage -- long before Biden, former President Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton -- and he gave unintimidated support to his daughter Mary Cheney and her wife and their children.\n\nHe gave unintimidated support as well to his daughter Liz Cheney, who, as a former Wyoming representative and member of the Republican leadership, opposed Trump's course of action on Jan. 6 and supported his impeachment, conduct that I wrote at the time \"any reasonable person could find impeachable.\" That led to the Cheneys' otherwise surprising endorsement of former Vice President Kamala Harris last year.\n\nLet me close on a personal note. When I ran into Cheney, he often recalled playing high school football for Casper against Worland quarterback Grant Ujifusa, who later created \"The Almanac of American Politics\" and enlisted me as a coauthor. With both now gone, I can't help thinking that playing high school football on cold -- maybe freezing -- Wyoming fall Friday evenings may leave you unintimidated by anything you face later.\n\nMichael Barone is a senior political analyst for the Washington Examiner, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and longtime co-author of The Almanac of American Politics.

Gavin Newsom’s roaring start to the 2028 presidential election may already be scaring away potential competitors.\n\nThat could be true when it comes to the candidate who possibly looks the best on paper: Gretchen Whitmer. As the center-left governor of a critical swing state who held major roles in the Joe Biden and Kamala Harris campaigns and who has managed to retain strong approval ratings, Whitmer seems to have everything going for her. (RELATED: Whitmer Says America Is Ready for a Female President)\n\nAnd yet, Michigan’s governor has numerous times in recent months suggested that she may not wage a presidential bid.\n\nSpeculation that she may pass on the race kicked off in April when she responded to the question of what she is looking forward to in 2026 by saying, “Retiring.”\n\nThis year, her appearances on national news shows have grown few and far between, leading many to conclude that she is stepping away from the limelight. Some also view her decision to prioritize working with President Donald Trump on Michigan’s needs — such as securing a new fighter jet mission at Selfridge Air National Guard Base — rather than fighting him at every turn, à la Newsom, as a retreat from a national political future. This term in office, Trump has, in appreciation of her strategy, called her “a very good person” and said she is doing an “excellent job.”\n\nWhitmer’s prioritization of collaboration with the president has disappointed some Democrats, with Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel saying, “Appeasement is not workable strategy with a fascist.” The famous picture of Whitmer holding up a folder to hide her face in the White House captures her effort to work with Trump despite the frustration within her own party.\n\nIn October, Whitmer was asked head-on about whether she would run for president by a Canadian journalist. She said, “I don’t know if I need to be the main character in the next chapter, but I want to have a hand in writing it.” Whitmer added that the speculation that she could run for president was a “big compliment.”\n\n“I think I’ve got an important vantage point as the governor of an important swing state,” she continued, “so I anticipate helping, but I don’t know if I’m going to be the person.”\n\nWhitmer also clarified that she wants to keep her attention on Michigan. “I got a big job right now to stay focused on, and I’m going to do that,” she said. “I don’t want to take my eye off the ball and go out having missed something, having lost something, having a catastrophe happen under my watch.”\n\nContrast that with Newsom’s splashy declaration on CBS News that he is considering a presidential run and will make a decision after next year’s midterms. (RELATED: Gavin Newsom’s Very Good Year*)\n\nThe different strategies come as early polling shows that Newsom has pulled well ahead of the pack. In a poll this month by Emerson College that asked voters the open-ended question of who they would support for the Democratic nomination for president, 24 percent said Newsom, while only 0.4 percent named Whitmer. Kamala Harris followed Newsom with 10 percent support, while Pete Buttigieg pulled in 9 percent. (RELATED: Pete Buttigieg: America’s Second Gay President?)\n\nBut as Newsom has burst out of the gate at full speed and continues to garner headline after headline crowing him Democrats’ frontrunner (“Admit It. Gavin Newsom Is the 2028 Front-runner”; “Gavin Newsom ‘light years ahead’ in 2028 Democratic field after Prop. 50 win”), Whitmer may have decided that it’s wiser to wait for Newsom to grow stale with voters or stumble on the trail before making her move.\n\nIf she wants to be in the race, however, she may have to act sooner rather than later. This week, Axios reported that some of her senior aides have begun looking for new jobs to take after Whitmer finishes her second term in office in January 2027 because “they haven’t got a signal to play for anything after her term ends.”\n\nWhitmer, Axios reported, is “privately expressing ambivalence about running for president in 2028.” Even still, the outlet added that the governor has also privately said that she is keeping her options open.\n\nLast month, Whitmer did tell Bloomberg News: “I can’t rule anything out at this juncture.” Also, a “senior Michigan Democrat” told Axios that the idea that Whitmer is taking herself out of the race is merely “wishful thinking on behalf of some Democrats.”\n\nIn other private discussions reported on this week by Axios, Whitmer has reportedly told people that she “feels obligated to focus on Michigan through the end of her term rather than take more steps for a presidential campaign.”\n\nGavin Newsom has chosen to go the route of unabashedly running for president even while governor of California. If resentment grows over the perception that Newsom is in it only for himself and that he isn’t solving California’s problems — as it has in the past — then that strategy could come back to bite him. If it does, then Whitmer will be able to say that she was the one who remained focused on the people of her state.\n\nAnd if Newsom’s strategy doesn’t backfire?

Of them, 62% said they were worried equally about antisemitism coming from both political sides (left and right), 20% were mainly worried about antisemitism from the left, and 17% claimed most concern about antisemitism from the right. When asked how Mamdani’s election affects their feelings, the dominant sentiment was “concern” (56%). A large majority (67%) believe the election is likely to hurt the security of New York’s Jewish community only 6% think the community’s security could strengthen. Most American Jews now view Mamdani as anti‑Israel and antisemitic Although in recent U.S. election polls about a third of Jewish voters in New York supported Mamdani, the JPPI survey now shows that nearly two‑thirds of U.S. Jews (64%) define him, after the election victory, as both anti‑Israeli and antisemitic — a sharp rise since the survey began last summer. An additional 19% consider him anti‑Israeli but not antisemitic. The survey also gauged opinions on the connection between anti‑Zionism and antisemitism: 72% of respondents believe that anti‑Zionism is indeed antisemitism, either “definitely” or “usually” 17% think anti‑Zionism is antisemitic only “sometimes.” Only 11% believe the two are completely separate. Importantly, there is a stark divide along ideological lines: among “very liberal” respondents, only 44% see anti‑Zionism as antisemitism — compared with 92% among “very conservative” Jews. Despite the tension, JPPI finds high support for Zionism among American Jews: 70% of respondents define themselves as Zionists, and another 12% say they are “non‑Zionist but support Zionism.” Only 3% define themselves as anti‑Zionist. Among Jewish Trump voters, Zionism support reaches 81%, compared with 64% among Jews who voted for Kamala Harris. Zionism is not racism This month marks 50 years since the 1975 UN decision that declared Zionism “a form of racism” (Resolution 3379). Regarding this legacy, 59% of JPPI respondents say “there is nothing racist about Zionism.” A quarter (28%) say Zionism is not racist, though some interpret it that way. Eight percent see Zionism as mostly non‑racist though containing a few racist elements, and only 4% responded that “Zionism is racism.” When asked what they believe “the average American” thinks, only 8% thought the average American sees Zionism as a non‑racist movement. Some 36% believe the average American might view Zionism as potentially interpretable as racist, but not racist per se 14% thought the average American sees Zionism as racist, and 22% think the average American sees at least some racist elements in it. With Hanukkah approaching, respondents also showed strong attachment to Jewish tradition: 82% plan to light candles all eight nights of the holiday, and another 11% said they will light at least partially. The survey polled 745 American Jews registered with JPPI’s “Voice of the Jewish People” panel — a group generally representative of relatively connected Jews with strong ties to the Jewish community, Israel or Jewish identity.","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/jewish-world/article/hjkbpv811zx","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/11/21/SkKPyL0x11e/SkKPyL0x11e_0_0_3000_1978_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-28 00:52:08","author":"Itamar Eichner","authors":["Itamar Eichner"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.159},{"id":383116634,"title":"Old Memes Explode As Kamala Harris’ Thanksgiving Kitchen Moment Hijacked By Trolls","text":"The International Emmys 2025 celebrated outstanding television from around the world, honoring winners across 16 diverse categories selected from 64 nominees representing 26 countries.

But after the victories of both Virginia governor-elect Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat, and New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, a progressive, Martin believes the party is on the right track. FORMER DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TALKS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF HIS PARTY AFTER OFF-YEAR ELECTION SUCCESS He reportedly also said that young people feel \"disillusioned\" by the lack of job opportunities, something he blamed on President Donald Trump's administration. Prior to the off-year elections, James Carville, a veteran strategist for the Democratic Party, warned that far-left messaging and policies were hurting the Democratic Party’s image with young men. \"They were told, ‘The future is female, you must always believe the woman is never wrong, #MeToo,'\" Carville said on a podcast in July. \"And men are like, ‘S---, do I count? What about my life? I mean, we're only 48% of the voting population.’\" More recently, he has argued that any future president from either party will have to move in a more economically populist direction to win back young people who cannot afford the same standard of living as their parents and grandparents. KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 2025 ELECTIONS In March, New York Times columnist Ezra Klein spoke with a Democratic pollster David Shor about how \"75-year-old White men supported Kamala Harris at a significantly higher rate than 20-year-old White men.\" \"It is a real shift,\" Shor agreed. \"This is the thing I am the most shocked by in the last four years — that young people have gone from being the most progressive generation since the Baby Boomers, and maybe even in some ways more so, to becoming potentially the most conservative generation that we’ve experienced maybe in 50 to 60 years.\" NYU professor Scott Galloway argued that the affordability crisis made people turn against Democrats in 2024. He argued in a podcast in November that one of the biggest shifts he noticed in the 2024 election was middle-aged women toward the GOP, suggesting that mothers were voting for Republicans in order to help their struggling sons.

Americans of all persuasions, races, and creeds will gather with family around the table and give thanks, most of them to the Almighty, for the bounty they have received this year.\n\nIt’s easy to take Thanksgiving for granted. And yet it is something uniquely American, and truly a wonder. It is a holiday that confirms that we as a country are committed to gratitude and to recommitting ourselves annually to this national character trait.\n\nIt acts as some sort of baptismal sacrament. Immigrants take their first timorous step toward Americanization when they start honoring this sacred holiday and learn to cook its dishes. And thereby, without being fully aware, they begin to incarnate the national spirit.\n\nIn personal terms, a disposition to be grateful renders important benefits, reducing anxiety and depression, and making us better companions and better sleepers. This is so self-evident it hardly requires research to substantiate it, but the evidence does exist.\n\nIn geopolitics, the thankful disposition draws a bright line between the United States and wretched states officially devoted to its opposite, ungratefulness. A commitment to gratitude may have been one of the things—right up there with love of liberty—that made America the historic sworn enemy of Marxism, whose guiding ideology, envy, is the wages of ingratitude.\n\nThanksgiving is unquestionably uniquely American. I have lived at least a year in seven countries, in Asia, Europe, and the Americas, many more if one counts shorter stays, and have never encountered anything like it anywhere else.\n\nYes, in East Asia, I experienced firsthand what the Koreans call the Chuseok festival, held on 15th day of the eighth month of the lunar calendar, so from late September to early October, depending on the year. But it’s not dedicated to giving thanks, but rather to the full moon.\n\nCanada, Liberia and the Caribbean island-nation of Grenada also have official Thanksgiving days, but they are derivatives of America’s.\n\nThanksgiving is not just uniquely tied to this country because it is reflective of the American national character. Its lineage is the thread of the national quilt.\n\nAnyone who has watched A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving, and its companion, The Mayflower Voyagers, will know the essentials of how the first Thanksgiving was celebrated by the Pilgrims and their Indian hosts in 1621 in the Plymouth Colony. Right there, Thanksgiving starts as a needed slap in the face to the “land acknowledgement” crowd.\n\n(And yes, it might be better to read a book and learn history right and not from Peanuts, but don’t underestimate the value of popular culture in propagandizing the national spirit. When Charlie Brown exclaims at the Thanksgiving table, “We thank the Lord for a bountiful harvest,” Hollywood was telling generations of young Americans that it wasn’t just ok to be patriotic and faithful, but that it was normal and expected.)\n\nThen, in one of its very firsts acts, the first Congress in 1789 requested that the newly elected President Washington proclaim a national day of Thanksgiving.\n\nBut it wasn’t till later, in the middle of the Civil War and in response to a persistent, decades-long letter-writing campaign by editor and writer Sarah Josepha Hale, that Abraham Lincoln in 1863 proclaimed the last Thursday in November as our official day of Thanksgiving. Then Congress in 1941, just as America was about to enter another war, officially made it the fourth Thursday.\n\nThus, Congress and our most important leaders ratified an outlook that is the gift that keeps on giving.\n\nExperiencing gratitude is “associated with greater longevity among older adults,” says a Harvard study last year. According to the British Psychological Society, “around 18.5 per cent of individual differences in people’s happiness could be predicted by the amount of gratitude they feel.”\n\nSaying thanks to your partner and meaning it also makes the institution of marriage stronger. A team at the University of Illinois found that “higher levels of perceived gratitude buffered against the stresses of both financial strain and ineffective arguing.” (One could ask, in marriage, is there any other type of arguing?)\n\nMeanwhile, at UC Berkeley, a 2009 study found that “Gratitude was uniquely related to total sleep quality, subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, and daytime dysfunction.”\n\nOf course, Presidents Washington, Lincoln and Roosevelt, and the various congresses in question—to say nothing of the Pilgrim fathers, Samoset or Squanto—did not have any of these benefits in mind, they just wanted to thank the Lord. Maybe the unintended consequences are payback.\n\nThat is not going to help you deal with your aunt who voted for Kamala Harris and will show up dressed in a Handmaid’s Tale outfit. Just tell her that if President Trump and Zohran Mamdani can bury the hatchet, she can get along with others, too.\n\nHappy Thanksgiving.\n\nOriginally published by Washington Examiner.","summary":"The nation will this week partake in a ritual unlike any other in the rest of the world.

This month, the longest government shutdown in U.S. history brought the deepest disruption to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program since Johnson made it permanent.\"\n\nClifton adds, \"In Martin County, families are preparing for Thanksgiving as roughly 23 percent of residents, or around 1300 households, rely on SNAP to put food on the table.\"\n\nThe Nation reporter notes that in 2024, Trump won 91 percent of the vote in Martin County.\n\n\"Trump's 'One Big, Beautiful Bill' will also jeopardize SNAP benefits for 114,000 people, or roughly one-fifth of recipients, in Kentucky, where work requirements will now expand to roughly 50,000 people aged 54 to 65, along with caregivers whose children are older than 14, starting in early 2026,\" Clifton explains. \"The bill also expanded work requirements for military veterans and people experiencing homelessness — effectively pushing many out of a program they rely on to not go hungry.\"\n\nAccording to Jason Bailey, director of the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, Trump's One Big, Beautiful Bill Act of 2025's work requirements are \"particularly problematic\" in Kentucky because it has \"the second-highest food insecurity in the United States for adults over 50.\"\n\nThomas Howell, a 25-year-old fast food worker in Martin County, told The Nation, \"It sucks, but right now, I don't have my own vehicle — and it's pretty much the only work opportunity I have.

More than half of people in the UK believe the differences in people’s political views are so divisive it is dangerous for society, recent polling by Ipsos found.\n\nThe changes in political polarisation resulting from exposure to X posts were measured using a novel approach. First, the academics used AI to analyse posts in X’s “for you” feed in real time. Then the system showed more divisive posts to one cohort and fewer divisive posts to another, a power normally the sole preserve of X. Divisive posts included those that showed support for undemocratic practices, partisan violence, opposition to bipartisan consensus and biased evaluations of politicised facts.\n\nAfter a week of reading these subtly altered feeds, the researchers asked users to rank how warm or cold, favourable or unfavourable they felt towards their political opponents. The changes in “affective polarisation” were ranked at more than two degrees on a 0 to 100 degree “feeling thermometer”. This was the same amount of increased polarisation that typically occurred in the US in the four decades to 2020. Feeding users fewer posts with antidemocratic attitudes and partisan animosity decreased political division by a similar amount.\n\nSocial media platforms have long been accused of encouraging divisive content to boost user engagement and therefore advertising revenues. But the research found that while there was a slight reduction in overall engagement in terms of time spent on the platform and numbers of posts viewed when divisive content was down-ranked, those users tended to “like” or repost more often.\n\n“The success of this method shows that it can be integrated into social media AI to mitigate harmful personal and societal consequences,” the authors wrote. “At the same time, our engagement analyses indicate a practical trade-off: interventions that down-rank [antidemocratic and partisan content] may reduce short-term engagement volume, posing challenges for engagement-driven business models and supporting the hypothesis that content that provokes strong reactions generates more engagement.”","summary":"Study finds that a week of political content can bring about a shift in views that previously would have taken three years\n\nSmall changes to the tone of posts fed to users of X can increase feelings of political polarisation as much in a week as would have historically taken at least three years, research has found.\n\nA groundbreaking experiment to gauge the potency of Elon Musk’s social platform to increase political division found that when posts expressing anti-democratic attitudes and partisan animosity were boosted, even barely perceptibly, in the feeds of Democrat and Republican supporters there was a large change in their unfavourable feelings towards the other side.\n\n Continue reading...","url":"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/nov/27/partisan-x-posts-increase-political-polarisation-among-users-social-media-research","image":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bce34435ba0b45acd799c01d4d7f88b251029f96/256_0_2631_2104/master/2631.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 19:00:43","author":"Robert Booth","authors":["Robert Booth"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.19},{"id":382984406,"title":"This MAGA leader's angry exit spells mortal danger for Trump","text":"Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene surprised me Friday by announcing her resignation, effective Jan. 5.\n\nI was surprised, because just a few days prior she flexed her muscle when she got the president to step off. She had been demanding the release of the Epstein files. Donald Trump called her a traitor. Though she got death threats, she didn’t budge. Then, last Monday, he caved.\n\nCNN’s Dana Bash said their feud was the breakup heard around the world. That seemed confirmed by Greene’s resignation. Trump called her a RINO (Republican in Name Only). He pledged support for a primary challenger. Indeed, it appeared she is similar to many moderate Republicans, a casualty of a GOP in thrall to Trump.\n\nBut I think there’s another way of looking at it.\n\nFirst, it’s far from certain that she would have lost. As I have said before, Greene is highly attuned to the conspiracy wing of the Republican Party. That’s the faction that demanded the release of the Epstein files. That’s the faction, on hearing last spring that the Justice Department would not make them public, that lost faith in Trump.\n\nGreene stood up to him and won. Would she lose next year? Maybe. But she also raised the question of whether Trump is a spent force.\n\nSecond, Greene is ambitious. She appears to be dissatisfied with representing a district and is aiming for something bigger, perhaps a run for the presidency or, more likely, a role in the pundit corps.\n\nBefore the official “breakup,” Greene said the president “abandoned” his MAGA base. She criticized the Republicans’ role in the longest government shutdown in history. She was vocal about dramatically rising Obamacare premiums. She trashed Speaker Mike Johnson.\n\nOn ABC’s The View, co-host Sunny Hostin said, “I feel like I’m sitting next to a completely different Majorie Taylor Greene.” \n\nCo-host Joy Behar said, “Maybe you should become a Democrat.” \n\nIn response, Greene said, “I’m not a Democrat. I think both parties have failed.”\n\nIt doesn’t take much to imagine her as a television pundit who speaks for the alienation of the MAGA faithful from all politics. (Also: she’s resigning in January. Congresspeople don’t usually do that if they believe they can’t win. Instead, they say they aren’t running again.)\n\nThat leads me to my final point. It’s being suggested that Greene wasn’t MAGA enough. Trump declared her persona non grata. As a consequence, she’s resigning. This is the president’s preferred view.\n\nBut the truth is probably the opposite.\n\nGreene is MAGA to the core. She embodies its purest id. She spread the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. She defended the J6 insurrection. She suggested support for executing Democrats. The list goes on and on. It could be that Greene is leaving because there’s no future for her. But it could be that she’s leaving because there’s no future for MAGA.\n\nGreene implied as much in her resignation announcement.\n\nIn the video, she characterized herself and Trump voters as loyal soldiers in a rebellion against the establishment. She suggested that they were betrayed by their leader, who joined forces with the enemy.\n\n“I refuse to be a battered wife, hoping it all goes away and gets better. If I am cast aside by the president … and replaced by neocons, big pharma, big tech, military industrial war complex, foreign leaders and the elite donor class that can never ever relate to real Americans, then many common Americans have been cast aside and replaced as well.”\n\nBut the strongest evidence to suggest that Greene herself does not believe there’s a future for MAGA came when she said the following:\n\n“There is no plan to save the world or a 4-D chess game being played.”\n\nIt’s just one line, easily overlooked, but it’s critically important. It refers to the story that the conspiracy wing of the Republican Party believes to be the absolute truth — that there is a secret cabal of pedophiles, represented by Jeffrey Epstein, that’s trying to destroy America.\n\nThe hero of the story, Trump, was supposed to return to power after being cheated in 2020 to reveal the names of the conspirators. (They were said to be people like billionaire George Soros and other super-Jews who “control” Democrats like Barack Obama.) The plan was supposed to culminate in a bloody day of reckoning called “The Storm.” It was to vanquish evil, restore justice and make America great again.\n\nWhen the Justice Department decided against releasing the Epstein files, on account of Trump’s name appearing in them too many times, MAGA supporters experienced a crisis of faith. He had forced them to choose between believing in him or believing in their enemies.\n\nIn her resignation announcement, Greene affirmed that the enemies are indeed real: \n\n“Standing up for American women who were raped at 14 years old, trafficked and used by rich powerful men, should not result in me being called a traitor and threatened by the president.”\n\nAnd in saying “there is no plan to save the world,” she came as close as she’ll get to telling supporters they’re right to stop believing in him.\n\nThere will be no storm, she suggests.\n\nShe isn’t a traitor to MAGA.\n\nBut, by implication, Trump is.\n\nThe president’s most zealous supporters have for years been willing to overlook his crimes, because, as believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, they believed he was chosen by God to vanquish villainy.\n\nTheir loyalty got him through the first impeachment. It got him through the pandemic and the J6 insurrection. It got him through the second impeachment. And, after GOP elites left him for dead, it was the basis for his political revival and victory nearly three years later.\n\nHowever, during the past few months, his most zealous supporters have been increasingly demoralized, unsure of what to believe about “the plan.” Now, with the alienation of a figure with impeccable MAGA credentials, they have a persuasive confirmation of their suspicions.\n\nTrump continues to believe, as president, that he can do whatever he wants, the law and the Constitution be damned. He was always mistaken in that belief, but the error is becoming increasingly acute.\n\nHe has divided MAGA, the most powerful political force protecting him from facing the full consequences of his actions. Meanwhile, the opposition is not only more united but downright burning with rage.\n\nThe story of Greene and a demoralized MAGA base is the untold aspect of next year’s congressional elections. Most of the focus is on indie voters who are getting madder about the high cost of essentials, and for good reason. Independents helped Trump beat Kamala Harris.\n\nBut what happens when MAGA thinks of Trump as no better than Harris? As Greene said, “both parties have failed.”\n\nThey don’t vote for Democrats.\n\nThey stay home.","summary":"Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene surprised me Friday by announcing her resignation, effective Jan. 5.\n\nI was surprised, because just a few days prior she flexed her muscle when she got the president to step off.

And he asked Judge Tanya Chutkan to dismiss his election interference case, which she did without prejudice.\n\nMeanwhile, the election interference/RICO case in Georgia, brought by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, was on life support. But it officially died when, on Wednesday, November 26, Judge Scott McAfee dismissed all charges. And supervising prosecutor Peter Skandalakis argued that keeping the case alive was pointless, writing, \"There is no realistic prospect that a sitting President will be compelled to appear in Georgia to stand trial on the allegations in this indictment. Donald J. Trump's current term as President of the United States of America does not expire until January 20, 2029.\"\n\nIn a biting article published by Salon the following day — Thanksgiving 2025 — political scientist Austin Sarat cites the Georgia dismissal as the latest example of President Trump continuing to dodge accountability despite \"particularly egregious\" acts.\n\n\"While good news for Trump,\" Sarat says of the decision, \"it was bad news for the rule of law and history itself. Peter Skandalakis' decision not only lets the president get away with his outrageous effort at election interference in a critical swing state, but his rendition of what Trump did and why he did it muddies the historical record. As the New York Times noted, Skandalakis, who is the executive director of the state's nonpartisan prosecutor council, 'shredded the case originally brought by Fani T. Willis, the Fulton County district attorney, taking it apart charge by charge in a 22-page filing.'\"\n\nAfter losing Georgia to Democratic nominee Joe Biden in 2020, Trump tried to pressure Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \"find\" him enough votes to overturn Biden's victory in the Peach State. But Raffensperger and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, both conservative Republicans, adamantly maintained that Biden won the state fair and square — much to Trump's chagrin.\n\n\"When Raffensperger resisted his entreaties,\" Sarat notes, \"Trump threatened him. If he didn't determine that thousands of ballots in Fulton County were cast illegally or destroyed, the secretary would be subject to criminal liability…. Surely, this was one of the most infamous exchanges in which a person serving as president of the United States had ever participated. It was also criminal.

Only six votes currently separate Mahmood, who has 2,060 votes, and his opponent, Adam Alharbi, who is currently in the lead with 2,066 votes. Alharbi opposes the counting of the 37 votes, saying that election fraud is a problem in Hamtramck.\n\nMark Brewer, an attorney representing Mahmood and a former chair of the Michigan Democratic Party, filed the lawsuit in Wayne County against the city of Hamtramck and the Wayne County Board of Canvassers. Brewer said in the lawsuit there was an \"unconstitutional disenfranchisement of 37 Hamtramck citizens and voters whose absentee ballots were not tabulated ... due to the admitted mistakes of Hamtramck election officials.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also alleges that \"the Wayne County Board of Canvassers failed to correct those mistakes. Those ballots should be counted or those voters given the opportunity to cast new ballots.\" The lawsuit details what it says were problems in how absentee ballots were tabulated on election day. City Clerk Rana Faraj has previously said that the 37 ballots were found in her office after the election.\n\n\"On Nov. 5,\" the day after the election, Faraj \"discovered that there was a 37-ballot discrepancy between the number of return envelopes delivered to the AVCBs (Absentee Voter County Boards) and the number of ballots the AVCBs reported as tabulated,\" the lawsuit said. \"She discovered that 37 return envelopes in her office still contained the untabulated absentee ballots.\"\n\nFaraj then \"immediately placed the 37 ballots—which had unintentionally been left in their return envelopes, where they remained at all relevant times—in a secure container, sealed it, and delivered it to the Wayne County Board of Canvassers,\" reads the complaint seeking relief.\n\nBut the two Republicans on the four-member Wayne County Board of Canvassers voted to block counting the 37 ballots during its meetings on Nov. 13 and 14. The vote was 2-2, with three votes need to pass a motion to count them. Alharbi, a patent engineer who works for the Commerce Department, supported Donald Trump for president and has engaged with Republicans while Mahmood, who works in a restaurant at MGM Grand, is a Democrat who supported Kamala Harris. During the board meetings on Nov. 13 and 14, Mahmood, an immigrant from Bangladesh, received support from leaders in the Bangladeshi American community to count the 37 votes, while Alharbi, an immigrant from Yemen, had supporters in the Yemeni American community who urged the board to not count the 37 ballots.\n\nLisa Capatina, a Republican who is chair of the Wayne County Board of Canvassers, did not return a message from the Free Press seeking comment. Hamtramck city attorney Odey Meroueh also did not return a message seeking comment on the lawsuit.\n\nNabih Ayad, an attorney for Alharbi and founder of the Arab American Civil Rights League, said he opposes the counting of the 37 votes.\n\n\"There is long standing precedence why votes are not counted by those that are tasked with knowledge and rules in the process of vote counting,\" Ayad told the Free Press. \"The Wayne County Board of Canvassers were clearly justified in not adding those votes due to serious issues of chain of custody and the consequences that come with the break in the chain of custody. Whether it’s in a criminal setting or our voting process, chain of custody is vital to the integrity of our democracy and that is why they where not included in the count. The mayor-elect will be filing to intervene on this suit as he is the certified winner.”\n\nThe current mayor, Amer Ghalib, elected in 2021, decided not run for reelection for another four-year term, after Trump picked him to be ambassador to Kuwait.\n\nBrewer said the lawsuit has been assigned to Wayne County Chief Judge Patricia Perez Fresard. Fresard on Nov. 14 denied a request by Alharbi, filed by Ayad, asking to disqualify Mahmood, alleging he does not live in Hamtramck. Mahmood has previously strongly denied allegations he lives in Troy instead of Hamtramck. Michigan State Police have said they are still investigating the residency allegations against Mahmood and another councilman.\n\nReporter Natalie Davies contributed to this report.\n\nContact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com, X @nwarikoo or Facebook @nwarikoo","url":"https://eu.freep.com/story/news/politics/elections/2025/11/27/hamtramck-mayoral-candidate-muhith-mahmood-sues-37-votes-counted/87478439007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/04/PDTF/87094861007-a-7-d-52-df-359-a-749-f-9-af-269-cd-37133-c-9-ee.jpeg?auto=webp&crop=4031,2268,x0,y302&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 14:50:55","author":"Detroit Free Press","authors":["Detroit Free Press"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.419},{"id":382754676,"title":"Ryan Lizza dating former Kamala staffer who’s looks just like his cheating ex, Olivia Nuzzi","text":"The scorned ex-boyfriend of former New York Magazine reporter Olivia Nuzzi has found new love with a radical former Kamala Harris staffer almost half his age — who’s the spit of his troubled ex.\n\nJournalist Ryan Lizza, 51, was photographed by the Daily Mail on a romantic Thanksgiving trip with Caroline Motley, a 28-year-old abortion-rights activist who has openly described herself as a man-hating “misandrist.”\n\nMotley also worked for Harris’s unsuccessful 2024 campaign — and was pictured crying when the VP gave her concession speech, admitting defeat to President Trump.\n\nThe blonde liberal warrior, who grew up in a $7 million DC-area mansion and was sent to boarding school, was pictured carrying a coffee with Lizza’s name on it after she stepped out of his DC apartment to fetch his order on Tuesday, the Mail Online reported.\n\nSoon afterward, Lizza emerged carrying his luggage, before the pair got into a waiting limo and sped off.\n\nLizza recently gushed in a blog about having a new love, without revealing her identity.\n\n“I also met the most extraordinary woman I’ve ever known, someone whose beauty, inside and out, takes my breath away.

For us, this was unexpected, but we never refuse contacts,\" Putin told journalists.\nThe president confirmed that a US delegation will visit Moscow for talks next week.\nJared Kushner Steps Into Ukraine Negotiations\nThe Financial Times reports that the White House is actively involving US President Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, in Ukraine negotiations. Kushner may soon replace Special Envoy Steve Witkoff in these discussions, according to sources cited by the publication.\nKushner has been married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka Trump, since 2009 and has played a key role in her father’s political and diplomatic initiatives. In 2016, he effectively organized Trump’s presidential campaign and has previously undertaken complex diplomatic missions. During Trump’s first term, Kushner led efforts to normalize relations between Arab states and Israel, and in October this year, he helped achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip.\n“His current task is to silence weapons and drones on the frontline in Donbas. Kushner’s involvement in one of the most challenging diplomatic maneuvers of Trump’s second term is part of the president’s plan to replicate the Gaza breakthrough,” the Financial Times noted.\nWitkoff’s Position Weakens\nThe position of Steve Witkoff was reportedly undermined on November 25, when Bloomberg published a transcript of an alleged leaked call between the envoy and Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov. No audio file was released, only the text.\nOn November 26, Trump announced that Kushner will soon travel to Moscow alongside Witkoff for a meeting with Putin. Earlier, on November 20, the Wall Street Journal reported that Kushner is one of the co-authors of the US 28-point peace plan for Ukraine.\nDiplomatic Expertise and Strategy Shift\nAccording to Philip Gordon, National Security Advisor to former US Vice President Kamala Harris, Kushner’s involvement could mark a breakthrough in diplomacy. \"Like Witkoff, he enjoys the president’s trust, which is essential for any successful negotiator. Unlike Witkoff, however, Kushner has extensive diplomatic experience,\" Gordon said.\nFurthermore, the overall US approach to Ukraine is changing. Senator Marco Rubio indicated that Washington seeks to abandon full support for Ukraine in favor of a neutral stance in negotiations. Reports from Politico suggest the US is pushing Ukraine to sign a conflict resolution agreement before providing clear security guarantees. According to one US official, security guarantees were mentioned only once by the Secretary of State, and later omitted entirely.\nHowever, this strategic shift may face resistance not only from Europe but also domestically, as several Republican lawmakers have criticized the president’s plans.","summary":"Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that the appearance of a US administration representative at negotiations in Abu Dhabi was unexpected, but emphasized that Moscow never refuses contact.\n\"A representative of the US administration attended this meeting.

Besides coming in a distant third to the repeats airing on Fox News and MS NOW (previously MSNBC), Michaelson’s two-hour show isn’t yet drawing the ratings that CNN’s encore presentations were.\n\nAccording to Nielsen, The Story Is – which airs at midnight ET/ 9 pm PT – is averaging 213,000 total viewers a night and 35,000 in the key advertising demographic of adults aged 25-54 since debuting on October 27 and through November 21.\n\nThe program, which also airs on CNN International and broadcasts in the morning hours in several overseas time zones and boasts a large global footprint of more than 300 million households and hotel rooms, is currently trailing the US viewership numbers that repeats of Erin Burnett Outfront and Anderson Cooper 360 had scored in the same time slot last quarter and in September.\n\nDuring the third quarter of this year, CNN’s late-night reruns averaged 242,000 viewers overall and 41,000 in the key demo. In the month of September, the encore broadcasts of Burnett and Cooper attracted a nightly total audience of 225,000 and 37,000 in the 25-54 demographic.\n\nAs for its current head-to-head competition, Michaelson’s show is attracting less than one-third of Fox News’ total viewership and barely half of MS NOW’s. \n\nSince The Story Is debuted, Fox News’ post-midnight programming – which generally consists of repeats of Jesse Watters Primetime and The Five – has averaged 676,000 total viewers and 80,000 in the 25-54 demo. \n\nOver on MS NOW, the encore telecasts of The Rachel Maddow Show, The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell and The Briefing with Jen Psaki have nabbed a nightly total viewership of 411,000 and 50,000 in the key demographic.\n\nPerhaps even more startling for Michaelson’s show, though, is how it compares to CNN’s late-night reruns from a year ago. At this same time in 2024, the network’s midnight to 2 a.m. ET repeats averaged 387,000 total viewers and 124,000 in the advertising demo – representing a 72 percent drop for The Story Is among younger viewers.\n\nOf course, much of the year-over-year comparison includes the stretch run of the 2024 presidential race and the election of Donald Trump, which saw inflated ratings across the cable and broadcast news landscape. At the same time, though, both CNN and MSNBC saw immediate drop-offs in their viewership following Trump’s second electoral victory on November 5.\n\nStill, it seems that Michaelson’s two-hour broadcast could be on the cusp of building an audience. After averaging just 197,000 total viewers in its first two weeks on the air, The Story Is pulled in a nightly viewership of 242,000 and 41,000 in the key demo last week. Both of those numbers are on par with CNN’s late-night programming last quarter.\n\nOn top of that, Michaelson broadcasting live while the other cable news networks were airing dated reruns allowed for his show to be ahead of the competition in terms of breaking news, such as Marjorie Taylor Greene quitting Congress or Trump’s high-stakes meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping in South Korea. Furthermore, other networks — including Fox News — have picked up several clips and quotes from Michaelson’s interviews with California Gov. Gavin Newsom and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, among others. \n\nMichaelson is also dealing with the headwinds affecting all of cable and broadcast television, particularly news broadcasting. The combination of continued cord-cutting, the glut of streaming services, and younger demographics increasingly turning to online sources for news has been a drain on the cable news industry – not to mention Trump’s return to the White House, which has prompted a wide swath of disillusioned viewers to turn the dial.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2025, CNN experienced a 42 percent drop in total primetime viewers and a 58 percent decline in the 25-54 demo compared to the same quarter last year. MSNBC was also down 46 percent in total primetime audience and 64 percent in the key demographic year-over-year.\n\nEven Fox News, which saw a post-MAGA ratings boost following Trump’s win, has begun to see a bit of erosion in recent months. Compared to last year, Fox News dipped nine percent in total viewers and 34 percent in the advertising demographic this past quarter. The network was also down six percent in total viewers and 20 percent in the demo during primetime compared to the second quarter.\n\nPrior to joining CNN, Michaelson had made a name for himself as a highly respected local anchor in Los Angeles, winning eight Emmys and being named TV Journalist of the Year in 2023 by the Los Angeles Press Club. At KTTV-Fox 11, where he created and hosted The Issue Is with Elex Michaelson, he scored interviews with Trump, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, among others.\n\n“I am so excited to join CNN and learn firsthand from some of the most talented journalists on the planet,” Michaelson said when CNN announced his hiring in September. “I’m especially grateful that CNN is expanding its investment in my hometown as the West Coast houses so many global leaders in politics, entertainment, technology, sports and more. This is truly a dream job.”\n\nWhile Michaelson told Deadline that he had long pitched the network on the idea of a live show for the late-night time slot, the California journalist wasn’t CNN’s first choice for the midnight spot.\n\nEarlier this year, Jim Acosta decided to leave the network after it pulled his morning time slot and offered him the “graveyard” shift that Michaelson currently occupies. The move would have also entailed Acosta relocating to Los Angeles, and his show would have been simulcast on CNN International.","summary":"According to Nielsen, The Story Is – which airs at midnight ET/ 9 pm PT – is averaging 213,000 total viewers a night and 35,000 in the key advertising demographic of adults aged 25-54 since its debut.","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/cnn-elex-michaelson-cable-news-ratings-b2872946.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2025/11/26/13/29/20250910-em_t1.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 13:54:55","author":"Justin Baragona","authors":["Justin Baragona"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.162},{"id":382921338,"title":"How Trump’s 'reverse philanthropy' is 'making rich people worse': analysis","text":"During his 2024 presidential campaign, Donald Trump aggressively campaigned on the economy — repeatedly blaming the Biden Administration for inflation — and it worked.

Of course, it’s an off-year election. It’s right after Thanksgiving. A lot of the Republicans are out of town. And I worry about them showing up on Election Day,” Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.), who represents Tennessee’s District 2, which encompasses Knoxville, told The Post.\n\n“It’s a razor-thin margin.”\n\nElevating the stakes of the Dec. 2 election is firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) recent retirement announcement. \n\nIf Democrats eke out an upset victory in Tennessee District 7, then proceed to win their two vacated seats in special elections, the GOP’s House majority could eventually fall to 218 to 216.\n\nUnder that scenario, House Republicans wouldn’t be able to afford any defections on partisan legislation. Over the past year, they’ve often had at least one, usually from Libertarian-leaning Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) Additionally, the GOP’s House majority could vanish before the midterms if any other rep retires early.\n\nFurther fueling those concerns is a shock survey by Emerson College Polling and The Hill out Wednesday that pegged the race in a dead heat. \n\nRepublican Matt Van Epps only bested Democrat Aftyn Behn — dubbed “AOC of Tennessee” — by 48% to 46%, which is within the margin of error, the poll found. \n\n“I think the polls are a little bit misleading, because it seems that older Tennesseans are voting and they generally vote more conservative than the younger folks do,” Burchett admitted.\n\nStill, Burchett, who has campaigned with Van Epps twice, cautioned Republicans to “be aware” of the risks.\n\n“If it’s close, that should be a big enough wake-up call,” he added. “If [Behn] wins, I think it could be devastating for us.”\n\nThe special election in Tennessee follows a Democratic sweep in the off-year election, where polling often overestimated Republicans, particularly in the New Jersey governor’s race.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris raised eyebrows when she stumped for Behn earlier this month, indicating how some Democrats think the special election might be in play.\n\n“Matt Van Epps will be a member of Congress,” National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) spokesperson Reilly Richardson confidently told The Post when asked about warning signs in the race.\n\nSome left-leaning operatives quietly doubt that Behn will win and allege that Republicans raising fears are simply engaging in a ploy to gin up turnout and lay the groundwork to undermine what they expect will be a significant Democratic overperformance.\n\n“The Republicans are dumping over $1.5 million into this Trump +22 district in a desperate last-minute attempt to avoid a Democratic overperformance that will tell us what we already know — Republicans are going to lose the House majority next year,” a national Democratic strategist working on House races said.\n\nThe strategist added that a hypothetical Dem overperformance in Tennessee’s 7th Congressional District would prove the GOP’s “agenda is historically unpopular even in deep Trump country.”\n\nTop of mind for that strategist is the April special election in Florida when Rep. Randy Fine (R) ultimately prevailed by about 14 percentage points despite GOP handwringing heading into the race. \n\nTrump had seemingly been rattled enough by the GOP’s viability in special elction races that he yanked his nod for Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) to serve as US ambassador to the United Nations.\n\nThe Tennessee seat had been held by Rep. Mark Green, who chaired the House Homeland Security Committee and stepped down in July after Republicans passed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Green won reelection in 2024 by just over 21 points. \n\nDuring his special election campaign, Van Epps, a former commissioner of the Tennessee Department of General Services, has worked to highlight Behn’s lefty record. \n\nFive years ago, Behn had bashed Nashville on a podcast: “I hate the city, I hate the bachelorettes, I hate the pedal taverns, I hate country music, I hate all of the things that make Nashville apparently an ‘it’ city to the rest of the country.

This includes the Ripple payment network's bridge currency, XRP (XRP +1.17%), which has rallied 34% over the trailing year (as of the early evening on Nov. 23), while Bitcoin has retraced by 14% over the same time frame.\n\nDigital currency investors are always on the lookout for the next big thing in the cryptocurrency arena, with many latching onto high-profile blockchain and payment projects. While XRP hasn't been short of catalysts in 2025, several headwinds suggest it'll drop to $1 next year.\n\nXRP has been on fire, and it's not hard to understand why\n\nXRP's marked outperformance over the trailing year, relative to Bitcoin, boils down to five factors.\n\nArguably, the most important boost for XRP came in November, when President Donald Trump was elected to his second term. Compared to Democratic Party presidential nominee Kamala Harris, Trump was viewed as the more favorable candidate toward crypto. Bitcoin and most altcoins rallied following the president's November victory.\n\nThe second catalyst, which builds on the previous point, is the long-awaited resolution to litigation between the U.S. government and Ripple. Both parties agreed to drop their appeals following a 2023 split ruling that found some sales of XRP to institutional investors violated securities laws, but sales of XRP on public exchanges did not. The removal of this legal overhang ends years of uncertainty for XRP.\n\nThe rise of XRP has also been fueled by the approval of spot XRP exchange-traded funds (ETFs). These are ETFs that hold XRP tokens, providing investors with an easy way to gain exposure to and closely mirror the performance of the bridge currency of Ripple's payment network.\n\nThe fourth factor pushing XRP higher in 2025 is the growing utility of RippleNet, Ripple's payment network. More than 300 financial institutions around the globe are estimated to be using RippleNet, with some of these institutions relying on XRP as a bridge currency for cross-border transactions. The XRP Ledger can validate and settle transactions in roughly three to five seconds, with the cost of each transaction coming in at just fractions of a penny.\n\nLastly, Wall Street analysts have begun chiming in on popular altcoins currently living in Bitcoin's shadow. Analyst Geoff Kendrick of Standard Chartered set a price target for XRP of $12.50 by 2028. If Kendrick's assessment proves accurate, XRP would offer more than 500% upside over the next three years, as of this writing.\n\nXRP can lose 50% of its value in 2026\n\nWith a better understanding of what's been fueling XRP's recent outperformance, let's dig into the various headwinds that could stunt its rally and send this hyped digital currency back to $1 in 2026.\n\nThe leading factor that suggests XRP will struggle in the new year is its lack of catalysts. The end of litigation and the approval of spot XRP ETFs were both highly anticipated events this year. But with significant cash flows into spot XRP ETFs now in the rearview mirror, and no major announcements or events on the horizon, the typically emotion-driven XRP may struggle to gain traction.\n\nAnother issue for XRP is the realization that its adoption rate isn't as impressive as advertised. While RippleNet being used by more than 300 global financial institutions is nothing to sneeze at, more than 11,000 institutions rely on the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (better known as SWIFT) for their cross-border payments. It's going to be incredibly difficult for XRP to supplant SWIFT, and it may not make much, if any, headway in 2026.\n\nFurthermore, it's imperative to note that RippleNet doesn't require the use of XRP to facilitate payments. While it's a commonly used bridge currency, it's not being used universally in all countries. Purchases of XRP by financial institutions are likely necessary for XRP to continue its uptrend.\n\nI'd argue that investors are also wrongly conflating Ripple's future success with that of XRP. Ideally, investors would have the opportunity to invest directly in Ripple, gaining exposure to its payment network. But XRP's success doesn't correlate with that of Ripple. The latter can generate profits from RippleNet, while the former (XRP) lacks stand-alone value.\n\nIt's not even a certainty that XRP is the best solution for cross-border payments. While its average settlement time of three to five seconds is alluring, when compared to wait times of up to one week when making cross-border payments using traditional methods, Solana (SOL +4.55%) can validate and settle payments in an average of 400 milliseconds. Similarly, Stellar's (XLM +2.09%) peer-to-peer payment platform can rival the XRP Ledger in terms of average settlement time.\n\nThe final issue for XRP concerns digital currencies being tied to the outlook for equity markets. Although stocks and digital currencies should be two independently trading assets, Bitcoin and altcoins have been moving in lockstep with Wall Street.\n\nIn late October, the S&P 500's Shiller Price-to-Earnings Ratio peaked at a multiple of 41.20, which is its second-highest multiple during a continuous bull market when back-tested to 1871. In plain English, the stock market is historically pricey, and that's usually bad news for investors. If the S&P 500 were to dip into a correction or bear market, there's a good likelihood that cryptocurrencies would follow, with altcoins like XRP generating subpar returns.\n\nFollowing a year where everything was set up perfectly for XRP's success, 2026 could prove far more challenging.","summary":"With key catalysts now behind us, the shortcomings of Ripple's bridge currency will be on full display in the new year.","url":"https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/11/27/prediction-xrp-will-drop-to-1-in-2026/","image":"https://g.foolcdn.com/image/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F844299%2Fstock-market-crash-plunge-circle-bottom-invest-dow-sp500-nasdaq-getty.jpg&w=1200&op=resize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 08:51:00","author":"Sean Williams","authors":["Sean Williams"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.11},{"id":382607980,"title":"'Violence has no place in America': Barack Obama on Washington shooting","text":"Former US President Barack Obama has condemned the Washington shooting, stating that \"violence has no place in America\".

If you’re reading this, you are either pre-gorging or post-tryptophan coma…or it’s Friday, because who wants to read about the news on Thanksgiving? I hope it was a good one.\n\nLike last year, I wanted to take today’s column to look back at the year that has been (so far) and write a little about what I’m thankful for. With that in mind, here are the top 5 from the news (because, obviously, I’m most thankful for my family and friends – I’m not a joyless leftist miserable pile of garbage, after all).\n\nFirst: Even though it didn’t happen this year, I remain (and will remain) grateful for the results of the election just over a year ago. That may seem like a cop-out, but there was so much joy that it couldn’t possibly be contained by one calendar year. Plus, the inauguration was this year, so it’s valid.\n\nWith that in mind, I will fold in the fact that Kamala Harris is a private citizen. Imagine what the world would be like were she running around, ready to surrender to our enemies and welcome even more of the third world into the country in the left’s idiotic game of “Red Rover.” How glorious is it to know the border is sealed? It’s right up there with Kamala’s miserable book tour where she’s burning every bridge she’s ever crossed to make a few bucks. It’s funny to watch someone destroy their political career while thinking they’re helping their brand. It couldn’t happen to a nicer, more deserving person.\n\nSecond: ICE and the Border Patrol. It’s a thankless job, and was never a flashpoint before Democrats invited every pit around the world to release their version of Hunter Biden from their prisons and send them here, but now it is not only the most important gig in government, it is a dangerous one. It’s not that Democrats in Congress and the media want these agents dead, it’s that they don’t care either way. It’s also that they know they have a portion of their base who will try to kill them, but are too afraid to say they shouldn’t because Democrats are afraid their goon squad will turn on them.\n\nStill, these brave men and women serve to protect our country from the invasion. They show up to work knowing Democrats are targeting them. They show up knowing Democrats might ram them with their cars. They show up knowing those bastards will prosecute them in a heartbeat should they even accidentally cross a line, even though they regularly drop the charges against the left-wingers actively trying to “harm” them. We are all thankful they show up.\n\nThird: The National Guard. After the events in Washington, DC, yesterday, the rhetoric of the left trying to inspire violence with a plausibly deniable distance between the wink and nod of a “suggestion,” the fate of two National Guard members remains in limbo as of this moment. But those Democrats know what they did. And we know too.\n\nI’ll stop there with this one, lest I fill this column with expletives about those Democrats… Four: The upcoming 250th birthday of America. I know, it isn’t till next year, but it has already started and needs to be a continuous celebration. Our Founding Fathers did something extraordinary and it deserves a year of praise. Hell, it deserves constant praise.\n\nFar too many people born in this country take it for granted or have no idea that the country is special, let alone why. This is our chance to reach some of them. Sure, many will not care, but some will. That we can’t save everyone doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to save anyone.\n\nFive: Donald Trump. Never before has one man’s mere existence led to so many people having breakdowns and freakouts. No one has ever been able to manipulate the opposition political party into taking wildly unpopular positions by simply coming out in favor of the obvious and wildly popular side. It’s like convincing someone to break their own nose by telling them you simply don’t believe they could punch themselves in the face hard enough…and they do it.\n\nThe power of “being Trump” is almost greater than the presidency itself and it demonstrates just how dangerous and deranged the left has become. No other Republican would have been able to face this insanity and not try to quell it; try to compromise with it to be “loved,” or at least “liked,” by the left-wing establishment. Donald Trump doesn’t care. The push to “sell out” or to “compromise” to get along breaks most politicians at some point; Trump has not. I’m very thankful for that.\n\nThere is a lot to be concerned about this Thanksgiving – special elections, the midterms, Democrats in general – but the scales are tipped in our direction right now. For that, we should all be thankful. Now go shovel some more food down your throat and go Lions!\n\nDerek Hunter is the host of the Derek Hunter Show on WMAL in Washington, DC, and has a free daily podcast (subscribe!) and author of the book, Outrage, INC., which exposes how liberals use fear and hatred to manipulate the masses, and host of the weekly “Week in F*cking Review” podcast where the news is spoken about the way it deserves to be.

Straight Arrow News asked several popular AI chatbots how to deal with those conversations.\n\nWhat the bots had to say\n\nAmericans continue to increasingly see the country as more divided. So, what should you do when your liberal, college junior, cousin who now really likes the phrase “late-stage capitalism” comes home for break and sits down with your MAGA aunt who lives 100 miles into the country because it’s “safer.”\n\nSAN asked ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude what to do in this situation. Each of them said to come prepared with which topics you’ll allow yourself to jump in on and which ones you’ll avoid by going for that “walk around the block” with your fun cousin in the tie-dyed sweatshirt.\n\nEach one also recommended coming equipped with your “I” statements. That means instead of saying ’No, Aunt Karen, you’re wrong,” come back with “I feel concerned about…”\n\nOnce you’re into it, the bots said there’s always room for humor, especially to de-escalate, including lines like “turkey’s dry enough — let’s not cook each other too.” (Good one, ChatGPT).\n\nEach one also recommended conversing with “curiosity.” Instead of calling them stupid, ask your aunt why she supports deporting all of Southern California or why your cousin believes the entire police department should be replaced with social workers.\n\nOnce it inevitably gets heated, each bot said to make sure you know where your exit ramp is. Gemini is apparently especially concerned about this, saying you’ll know it’s gotten too emotional “if you feel your chest tighten or your breathing get shallow.”\n\nThey recommended exiting gracefully, suggesting you get a refill on food as a possible excuse to get up from the table, instead of going full Chris Evans in Knives Out. Although when asked, all three bots agreed that Evans’ famous sweater from that movie is a great choice for a Thanksgiving outfit, with Claude saying it’s “legendary as a Thanksgiving fashion statement.”\n\nAll the bots also ended with one thought: treat politics at the table like the Trump administration treats climate change, and the Biden administration treated Hunter Biden’s laptop, and just don’t talk about it.\n\nPolitics at the Thanksgiving dinner table\n\nNot talking about it seems to be the way most Americans will go about politics at the table this year. In a YouGov poll, only 11% of the 1,120 respondents said they expect political arguments at the table.\n\nOver 30% acknowledged that there would likely be some discussion of politics during dinner.\n\nThe fighting appears to come from the Wild West of the country, where 16% said they expect a duel during dinnertime. The Northeast expects calm, with only 7% expecting the same.\n\nFormer Vice President Kamala Harris once again finished behind Trump in a poll. Of those asked, 28% said those attending their dinner supported Harris, while 31% supported Trump.\n\nAmerican divisiveness\n\nThe reason this topic has become such a concern could come from the view that the country is more divided than ever. Pew Research Center polling found Americans think this is the most divided our country has been since the Civil War.\n\nProtests of the Trump administration have drawn millions of people this year.\n\nCivility has also gone downhill significantly, especially in politics.\n\nIn the end, maybe it’s best to remember this line from Claude.\n\n“Gratitude and connection are the real reasons you’re gathered.”\n\nThe post AI advice for talking politics at Thanksgiving is, actually, pretty good appeared first on Straight Arrow News.","url":"https://muvitv.com/2025/11/27/ai-advice-for-talking-politics-at-thanksgiving-is-actually-pretty-good/","image":"https://muvitv.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-109893733-1_Tony_EsparzaCBS_via_Getty_Images_clean-hAiQ9H.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 02:02:26","author":"Muvi","authors":["Muvi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"zm","sentiment":0.244},{"id":382567202,"title":"Massie: FBI threatened his staff if he didn’t ‘play ball’ over pipe-bomb investigation","text":"Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said an FBI official threatened to open a criminal investigation on one of his staff over his persistent investigation and questioning on the Jan. 6 pipe bombs.\n\nAn FBI official threatened to open a criminal investigation on one of Massie’s staff “if we didn’t straighten up [and] play ball,” Massie told Blaze News investigative reporter Steve Baker in an interview broadcast on Matt Kibbe’s “Free the People” podcast and posted to X.\n\n‘Even he understood that was not a good look. Probably illegal.’\n\n“I’m going to say this here on camera because it’s important. ... He said ... ‘We’re going to investigate one of your staff for fraud,’” Massie quoted the unnamed FBI official as saying. “And he told another one of my staff this: ‘If you guys don’t straighten up, you know, if you want to play hardball, if this is how you want to play it’ or something like that, ‘this member of your staff is going to get criminally investigated for fraud’ — a very specific threat.”\n\nMassie declined to identify the official he says levied the threat, but said he did complain about it to FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino.\n\n“I told Bongino, I said, ‘One of your guys is threatening my guys with an FBI investigation if we don’t do what you want.’ And he [Bongino] said, ‘I’ll take care of that.’ ’Cause even he understood that was not a good look. Probably illegal.”\n\nMassie said he later received a “non-apology” text from the official that said, “‘I’m sorry if I hurt your feelings.’”\n\n“He didn’t apologize. He was unrepentant, let's say, really.”\n\nMassie has been the most aggressive member of Congress investigating the pipe bombs found behind the Capitol Hill Club at 12:43 p.m. on Jan. 6 and under a park bench on the southwest side of the Democratic National Committee building 22 minutes later. In the same interview with Baker, Massie also disclosed that recent Blaze News reporting has caused him to be “99% certain” that some U.S. Capitol Police officials had a role in the planting of the pipe bombs found on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n“I went from 90% certain that some Capitol Police were involved in the Jan. 6 pipe bomb to 95% certain, and now I'm at 99% certain after this new story that you put out this week,” Massie told Baker.\n\n“I’m doing this on probability. The probability may even be higher than that.”\n\nHis comments reflect Blaze News’ recent reporting on a former Capitol Police officer who was an apparent forensic match to the bomb suspect, follow-up reporting on the manner in which the second device was discovered by plainclothes Capitol Police officers, and the stonewalling the congressman charges that he faced from Capitol Police in the course of his own investigation. Assistant Police Chief Ashan Benedict, whom Massie named as having specifically blocked his investigation, retired last week.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican also expressed frustration that FBI Director Kash Patel seems to have made little more progress than his predecessor, Director Christopher Wray. In an interview with Fox News earlier this month, as well as a follow-up with independent reporter Catherine Herridge, Patel promised that major developments are incoming, but was scant on details.\n\nA CBS story published Tuesday cited three unidentified sources stating that the FBI had cleared the police officer who appeared to match a forensic gait analysis of the bomber, citing “an alibi: video of her playing with her puppies at the time the devices were placed.” Blaze News has sought to obtain independent confirmation of the FBI’s clearance based on the alibi.\n\nBlaze News reported Nov. 8 on a forensic match to a former Capitol Police officer, based on a computer analysis of the hoodie-wearing alleged pipe bomber’s manner of walking compared to that of the person. The algorithm rated the person as a 94% match, while the intelligence analyst who ran the study for Blaze News put the match closer to 98%. The person has since denied any allegations, through her attorney.\n\n FBI photos \n\nBlaze News reported Nov. 18 that two Capitol Police counter-surveillance special agents sent out to look for more explosives after the discovery of the Capitol Hill Club device were seen on video going to the DNC building and to a nearby bush on the side of the Congressional Black Caucus Institute building.\n\nIndependent video investigator Armitas discovered that the hoodie-wearing suspect identified in 2021 as the pipe bomber stopped at the bush along a sidewalk on the north side of the CBCI building at 7:47 p.m. Jan. 5. The suspect sat cross-legged at the shrub and appeared to rummage through a backpack before leaning into the bush as if attempting to place something underneath.\n\nThe bomb suspect then stood up and walked back to the DNC bench, where a pipe bomb was placed at 7:54 p.m., according to choppy video released by the FBI.\n\n‘He had a handler, who would often interrupt and answer questions for him.’\n\nWhen Capitol Police dispatch warned of the Capitol Hill Club bomb at 12:43 p.m., two plainclothes Capitol Police special agents took a nearly six-minute drive to reach the Capitol Hill South Metro Station, one block from the Capitol Hill Club bomb scene. They then walked to the DNC building, passing the park bench the pipe bomb sat next to.\n\nThe agents continued walking until they reached an alley leading to the side of the CBCI building. Their movements were not captured on video because four Capitol Police security cameras that would have shown the DNC crime scene were turned away at key moments or pointed in another direction by default.\n\nMassie’s office released video in July 2023 showing a man in dark clothing and a ball cap approaching a U.S. Secret Service SUV sitting in the driveway of the DNC building as part of Vice President-elect Kamala Harris’ security detail. Harris was inside the building when the pipe bomb was discovered.\n\nBlaze News reported in January 2024 that this man was the plainclothes Capitol Police officer who discovered the pipe bomb under a bush at the foot of a park bench at the DNC building.\n\nFollowing that story, Massie told Blaze News he was determined to interview the agents, but did not get much cooperation from Capitol Police. Massie referred to the agents as “man-bun guy” and “backpack guy” (the one who discovered the bomb).\n\n‘Weirdest meeting’\n\nThe Capitol Police never made “backpack guy” available to the Massie, but on Jan. 30, 2024, they did eventually send his partner, accompanied by his commander, Benedict, to speak with the congressman in a meeting that was not recorded or transcribed.\n\n“So they came over to my office, but not ‘backpack guy,’” Massie said. “’Man-bun guy’ came over, and he had a handler, who would often interrupt and answer questions for him.”\n\nTwo congressional investigators sat in on the meeting alongside Benedict, the police officer, and Massie. The congressman later described the interview as the “weirdest meeting in the world.”\n\n Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said an FBI official threatened a criminal investigation of his staff if he didn’t “play ball” on the Jan. 6 pipe bomb investigation.Photo courtesy of Free the People\n\n“In the conversation with the counter-surveillance officer in my office, Ashan Benedict would frequently interrupt the officer, answer before the officer could reply, or qualify the officer’s answers,” Massie told Blaze News. “There was an effort by our committee staff to get Benedict to sit for a transcribed interview, but he successfully evaded that effort.”\n\nMassie said he still wants to interview the officer who actually found the bomb, as well as his partner and Benedict. “Those need to be transcribed interviews. They need to be sworn in. I feel very strongly about that,” he said. “But the reality is the FBI should be doing these things.”\n\nMassie said that after he reposted the Blaze News article on the gait analysis, Bongino called him to complain about two early persons of interest mentioned in the piece.\n\nOne of those men, named in FBI reports as Person of Interest 3, lived directly next door to the Capitol Police officer who was the subject of the Nov. 8 Blaze News article. The FBI’s Special Operations Group conducted surveillance on Person of Interest 3 in Falls Church, Va., for two days in January 2021, but surveillance was suddenly canceled, before any law enforcement officer ever questioned the man.\n\nMassie said Bongino told him, “‘That’s a dead lead. … We investigated that lead and … there’s nothing there. There’s no there there.’ So that’s why they quit looking at it. … At that point I said, ‘But you guys weren’t — you never did suspect him. The FBI never did suspect him. … His build doesn’t match. There’s no way it could be him. Your guys were looking for somebody else.’”\n\nWhistleblower concerns\n\nA current FBI supervisory special agent on Nov. 10 filed a whistleblower protected disclosure with Massie and U.S. Rep. Barry Loudermilk (R-Ga.), alleging the termination of surveillance at the Falls Church condominium complex was improper and cut off a suggestion by a surveillance team member that Person of Interest 3 be questioned face-to-face at his doorstep.\n\nPerson of Interest 3 and Person of Interest 2, his alleged houseguest on Jan. 5 and 6, 2021, had not been questioned by the FBI when surveillance was terminated. Interviews took place six days later, according to FBI reports included in the whistleblower disclosure. An FBI agent pretending to be a Metro Transit police officer interviewed Person of Interest 3 over the phone, a congressional source told Blaze News.\n\nThe whistleblower’s “concern was that the investigation that went to Falls Church, Virginia, that got them to the doorstep of the person that [Blaze News] identified through gait analysis as possibly somebody that might have been the person in the hood,” Massie said.\n\n“There were suggestions made to the people in charge of the investigation about how to follow up on those leads,” Massie said. “And it was just dropped after two days of surveillance. And he [the whistleblower] provided supporting documents to that effect.”\n\n Capitol Police block off the intersection of 1st and C streets in response to discovery of a pipe bomb at the Capitol Hill Club in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, 2021.U.S. Capitol Police\n\nMassie said Bongino made reference to the FBI conducting a meeting to address the whistleblower disclosure. “He didn’t say, ‘We’re trying to find the whistleblower,’” Massie said. “But my Spidey sense went off, and I almost said to him in that moment, ‘You better not be trying to find the whistleblower, because law protects that individual.’ But I didn’t say it.”\n\nMassie said he thought about this when recalling the threat he said his staff received from the FBI official.\n\n“I have to tell all the listeners this because this is the context in which I'm worried for the whistleblower,” Massie said. “If they're willing to retaliate against a congressional office, which has speech or debate immunity and a lot of other protections, they may be willing to retaliate against the whistleblower.”\n\nThe whistleblower’s attorney, Kurt Siuzdak, sent a letter to Massie and Loudermilk on Nov. 13, warning that if the FBI attempted to out the whistleblower, it would violate the supervisory agent’s protections under the law. Massie shared the letter on social media.\n\n“Identifying the whistleblower serves only one purpose,” Siuzdak wrote, “which is to allow FBI management to retaliate.”\n\nIn a Nov. 13 post on X, Bongino accused Massie of throwing “BS bombs” and denied that the FBI sought to identify or retaliate against the Nov. 10 whistleblower. A Blaze News request to Bongino for further comment went unanswered.\n\nLike Blaze News? Bypass the censors, sign up for our newsletters, and get stories like this direct to your inbox.

Some people said we were now the 51st state, and television commentators delivered emotional, and at times hypocritical, monologues imagining a new star on the American flag for Israel. Like many arguments rooted in political positioning, this one was shallow and overly dramatic. I still remember the claim that Trump’s America had “abandoned” Israel because it stopped taking part in airstrikes in Yemen. The same tone resurfaced at the start of Operation Rising Lion, when some insisted the United States would stay out of the campaign. The noise only grew louder before the operation, as Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly played to a media eager for even a hint of conflict. The very commentators who talked about abandonment quickly pivoted to saying Israel was now dependent on Washington. Anyone who follows complex situations wasn’t surprised this week when Israel stepped up its actions in both Gaza and Lebanon. The idea that Hamas would remain armed or that Gaza would avoid demilitarization exists only for those who refuse to accept how much changed on Oct. 7. People who understand international relations also understand that alliances are a mix of shared values, competing interests and the egos of national leaders. The relationship between Israel and the United States has never been simple or neatly controlled. History offers plenty of reminders. After Israel captured Sinai in the 1956 Suez Crisis, David Ben-Gurion withdrew under heavy pressure from President Dwight Eisenhower, despite having brushed off the United Nations a year earlier. Years later, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir held back from striking Iraq because Washington asked him to. When Barack Obama entered the White House, Netanyahu delivered the Bar-Ilan speech under American pressure. The left celebrated, the right felt betrayed and over time many understood it for what it was — a political maneuver. Israel had its interests then, the United States had its own, and they didn’t always match. Leaders had to decide whether to blow up the relationship or take some political hits to preserve larger strategic goals. These decisions always depend on timing and circumstances. Sometimes you keep your head down. Sometimes you stand your ground. It all depends on the equation in front of you. Netanyahu moved into Rafah despite objections from former President Joe Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris. When their administration paused weapons shipments, Netanyahu spoke out publicly. There are moments when Israel chooses restraint, and moments when it makes its position clear. Yet those who push the protectorate narrative ignore what has actually happened. According to them, Israel supposedly does nothing without American approval, Turkey supposedly controls Gaza and terrorists in the tunnels supposedly walk out unharmed. But Israel eliminated Hezbollah’s chief of staff, hit militants inside the tunnel networks and Turkey’s role has largely amounted to placing its flags on heavy equipment, despite the friendly ties between Trump and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. With the pace of recent events, it wouldn’t be surprising if the next round of claims flips again — that the Americans have now “abandoned” us because we are not obedient enough. Luckily, we’ve had plenty of practice dealing with these swings.","url":"https://www.ynetnews.com/opinions-analysis/article/r109xxb11zg","image":"https://ynet-pic1.yit.co.il/picserver6/crop_images/2025/10/14/r14TlBPs6gl/r14TlBPs6gl_0_0_3000_2122_0_large.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-27 01:14:04","author":"Naveh Dromi","authors":["Naveh Dromi"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"il","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":382588446,"title":"​GOP strategist says Trump's attacks on Democratic veterans are already backfiring","text":"Ever since President Donald Trump called for the imprisonment of several Democratic members of Congress — even endorsing a call for them to be hanged — their national profiles have been significantly elevated.
