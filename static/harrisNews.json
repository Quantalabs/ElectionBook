The Mideast is on the cusp of what might become its bloodiest war since Israel’s founding in 1948. Harris’ self-serving decision to pander to Gen Z and progressive votes on Thursday after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office is turning out to have deadly results. Harshly criticizing Israel as she did in front of Bibi at the White House might bag November votes – but they are also leading to body bags in Gaza and North Israel. Now, Israeli civilians are paying a heavy price for her words. In what could be described as a second Oct. 7, Hezbollah launched a rocket attack on a soccer field Saturday afternoon in the Golan Heights, killing 12 people, including children, and injuring 40. The attack struck the village of Majdal Shams. Home to a large Druze community – an Arab and Arabic-speaking ethnoreligious group. Many Druze are Israeli citizens and proudly serve in the IDF. Israel identified 30-plus projectiles crossing from Lebanon into Israeli territory and has blamed the Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist group for the attack. Hezbollah denies the accusation, “firmly denying” they fired the rockets. According to IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, the rocket used in the attack on the soccer field was an Iranian-made Falaq-1 rocket. If not fired by Hezbollah, then it could have been fired by Iranian Revolutionary Islamic Corps (IRGC) forces in Lebanon. Same difference. The White House is reportedly urging Israel to provide a “balanced response” to the latest atrocity. That is not likely. Harris told Netanyahu she would not be silent. Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran heard her loud and clear and just told her they will not be silent either. In telling Israel she has serious concerns, Harris unwittingly, yet predictably, sent a greenlight to all three Axis of Evil partners that it is open hunting season again on Israel and its civilians throughout the country. Harris naively might have thought her ploy for votes in Michigan would lead to a humanitarian ceasefire in Gaza. But that ceasefire is not going to happen now and Harris, despite her team’s denials to the contrary, shoulders much of the burden of blame. Israel is in damage control now. Harris is requiring a clean-up on aisle 9 – and now the IDF has a new and emerging mission in Northern Israel: destroying Hezbollah. It is highly likely that in the coming days, we will start to see kinetically the beginning of the end of Hezbollah in Lebanon. But the Biden-Harris White House’s ongoing failures in the Mideast have always been bigger than just Hamas or Hezbollah. Iran is the enemy Biden and Harris refuse to face down – and that Israel is forced to confront. Alone. Our military commanders get the broad nature of multiple threats emanating from Tehran. Harris does not. Biden may have once gotten it, but he effectively is no longer in charge. Iran as a threat is much bigger than Harris can grasp. Much bigger. Last week, Gen. Erik Kurilla, commander of U.S. Central Command, reportedly “advised in a classified letter to Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin that military operations in the region were ‘failing’ to deter Houthi attacks on shipping in the Red Sea and that a broader approach would be needed.” Military operations throughout the Middle East are ‘failing’ to deter Iranian-backed attacks against Israel, U.S. military bases, and commercial shipping in the Red Sea. The head of the hydra in the form of Iran is still firmly attached – and Harris is now forcing Israel to remove the Hamas and Hezbollah extremities. Iran has no intention of going quietly. Tehran’s march toward nuclear breakout continues unabated – and they are interpreting Harris’ campaign-driven words and actions as giving the Mullahs time and space. Israel will not go quietly either. The Druze hold special status in Israel – and have long been revered as fierce and cherished IDF compatriots. Hezbollah, in effect, in striking Israel, declared war on the Druze – and Harris is about to find out that this is a Pandora’s Box not easily closed no matter how many progressive and Gen Z votes she needs come November.

During an event on Friday, July 26, hosted by the conservative Christian organization Turning Point Action, Trump, 78, addressed the crowd and implied that if he were to be voted in, \"everything\" would be \"fixed,\" according to multiple sources, including Rolling Stone and The Hill. \"Christians, get out and vote, just this time,\" Trump said as the crowd in West Palm Beach, Fla., cheered, per the outlets. \"You won’t have to do it anymore,\" he said. \"Four more years, you know what, it will be fixed, it will be fine.

The 2024 Republican presidential nominee, who had notably been skeptical of cryptocurrency, made a stop at the event before his rally with running mate J.D. Vance on Saturday night in Minnesota. The addition of the Ohio senator to the GOP ticket was a welcome development for proponents of cryptocurrency, and Trump became the first president “ever to address a Bitcoin event.” “If I am elected, it will be the policy of my administration, United States of America, to keep 100% of all the bitcoin the U.S. government currently holds or acquires into the future, we’ll keep 100%,” Trump said. “I hope you do well, please. This will serve in effect as the core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile.” Trump also used the speech as an opportunity to denounce President Joe Biden, who defeated him in 2020, and Vice President Kamala Harris, whom he will likely face in the 2024 general election, for their “anti-crypto crusade” “I pledge to the bitcoin community that the day I take the oath of office, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris’ anti-crypto crusade will be over,” Trump said. “The moment I’m sworn in, the persecution stops and the weaponization ends against your industry.” The GOP nominee said the United States will become the “undisputed bitcoin-mining powerhouse” and told attendees that “you will not have to move your family to China.” “[If] we don’t embrace bitcoin and cryptocurrency, China will,” Trump said. “I want [it] to be mined, minted, and made in the USA. It’s not going to be made anywhere else. And if bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say … I want America to be the nation that leads the way.” Trump also noted that the federal government has almost 210,000 bitcoin, or 1% of the “total supply that will ever exist.” “As we implement these reforms, bitcoin and crypto will grow our economy, cement American financial dominance, and strengthen our entire country long into the future. Many Americans do not realize that the United States government is among the largest holders of bitcoin.” The former president also reiterated his commitment, if he is elected, to commuting the sentence of Ross Ulbricht, who is serving life in prison for various charges related to his role as the owner of Silk Road, an online black market. Trump was met with applause at the Libertarian National Convention in May for pledging to commute his sentence, and the bitcoin community reciprocated that encouragement.

It is his third rally since a gunman attempted to assassinate him on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.","summary":"Former President Donald Trump addressed a bitcoin conference Saturday in Nashville, Tennessee, promising that the United States will become a &#8220;bitcoin-mining powerhouse&#8221; if he is elected to a second term in the White House.

For J.D. Vance, the Republican vice presidential hopeful, one of the most bizarre claims that has recently taken the internet by storm is that he once had a sexual encounter with a couch. Yes, you read that right. As per Rolling Stone, the origins of this head-scratcher can be traced back to a social media post made on July 15, the day Vance was confirmed as Donald Trump’s running mate for the 2024 election. A user on X (formerly Twitter), jokingly suggested, “Can’t say for sure but [Vance] might be the first VP pick to have admitted in a New York Times bestseller to f***ing an inside-out latex glove shoved between two couch cushions (Vance, Hillbilly Elegy, pp. 179-181).” The tweet ignited a frenzy of jokes and memes across the platform. Netizens were quick to believe — or at least joke — about the possibility of Vance having done the deed with a couch. However, for those familiar with Hillbilly Elegy, it was clear that no such anecdote exists in the book. Vance’s memoir, which delves into his upbringing in a working-class Appalachian family, contains its fair share of controversial statements, but a story about a couch is not one of them. As per Vox, the rumor escalated when the Associated Press briefly published an article titled No, JD Vance Did Not Have Sex With a Couch, only to retract it shortly afterward. According to an AP spokesperson, the article had not gone through its standard editing process, leading to its removal. The retraction only fueled further speculation, with some humorously suggesting that the AP couldn’t definitively prove Vance had never engaged in such an act with a couch. AP confirmed, “The story, which did not go out on the wire to our customers, didn’t go through our standard editing process. We are looking into how that happened.” The incident, while humorous, has added to a series of missteps for Vance’s early campaign. His recent attempts at humor, such as, “I had a diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today and I’m sure they’re going to call that racist, too,” fell flat and were widely mocked. Additionally, past controversial comments, including a 2021 interview where Vance criticized Democratic nominee Kamala Harris,​ drew severe backlash. He had remarked, “We’re effectively run in this country — via the Democrats, via our corporate oligarchs — by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made, and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too. You look at Kamala Harris…the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children, and how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?”","summary":"Vance’s memoir contains its fair share of controversial statements, but a story about a couch is not one of them.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/heres-why-social-media-is-buzzing-with-rumors-of-jd-vance-having-sex-with-a-couch","image":"https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/707567/uploads/873b0430-4bf4-11ef-8601-17ad940d07d6_1200_630.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 23:46:03","author":"INQUISITR,Ishita Sen Gupta","authors":["INQUISITR","Ishita Sen Gupta"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":252784698,"title":"Kamala Harris makes Pittsfield her 1st campaign fundraiser stop","text":"Vice President Kamala Harris delivers remarks at a campaign event in Pittsfield, Mass., Saturday, July 27, 2024.

Rarely are those campaigns at Comic-Con, and rarely are they related to having Simpsons brainrot. But such was the case when Simpsons and Futurama creator Matt Groening climaxed the SDCC Simpsons panel by teeing up a clip from none other than Vice President Kamala Harris herself. During the recording, Harris quoted a legendary quote from a skit in the classic 1996 special, “Treehouse of Horror VII”: “We must move forward, not backward, upward, not forward, and always twirling, twirling, twirling towards freedom.” There are conflicting reports on the nature of the message, with some reports saying the audience believed the recording was made for the panel (Harris was not in San Diego today, but campaigning in Massachusetts). Others report that the clip is actually a resurfaced video from several years ago, when a group of University of Chicago students were apparently tasked with getting an elected official to recite the infamous quote. The line comes from, of course, “Citizen Kang”, the third and final skit from “Treehouse of Horror VII”. The short saw recurring Simpsons aliens Kang and Kodos infiltrate the then-upcoming 1996 US Presidential Election, taking the place of nominees Bill Clinton and Bob Dole. The alien duo then participated in their rival election campaigns before eventually assuming control of America, even after being exposed, due to the nature of the two-party electoral system. But Harris’ nascent campaign has already been inextricably linked with Simpsons memes and shitposts even before her surprise SDCC appearance. In recent days, one resurgent meme around Harris’ potential to become the first female President of the United States this year has seen her contrasted with the 2000 episode “Bart to the Future” and its own vision of the near future–putting images of an adult Lisa Simpson’s purple pantsuit as the future President of the US, belaboring a budget crunch inherited from President Trump, with images of Harris in a similarly-colored suit at Joe Biden’s inauguration in 2020. Is America ready for a President with a mind as addled by Simpsons quotes as the average thirty-somethings? Perhaps we’re about to find out. Want more io9 news?

In this interview with EJIKEME OMENAZU, he speaks on the festering crisis between Dangote Refinery and agencies’ heads in the oil sector, the reinstatement of Philip Shuaibu as Edo State governorship election, the state of the campaigns in the state, and the withdrawal of Joe Biden from the US election, among other issues. Excerpt: How do you see the recent disagree-ment between Dangote Refinery, NNPCL and Oil marketers? The recent disagreement be-tween Dangote Refinery and the NNPCL and its subsidiaries is an expression, interpretation and impression of a relationship gone sour upon which also the bottom has dropped irretriev-ably. Dangote is a pivot and very ubiquitous player in the Nigerian economy, producing, manufactur-ing, distribution and supplies of vital products of consumption to Nigerian homes and families. To this, I believe he has done cred-itably well. Again, not without the support and assistance of the various governments in Ni-geria. I must make haste to say that Dangote and his companies are strictly profit-oriented and must not be seen as though it is free in all its manufacturing and distributions of vital products in our lives. Dangote has virtually used all successive governments to hold Nigeria to ransom anyway. This is the truth. However, I am quick to note that the present im-broglio is not really about compe-tence or licence, or positively the call for monopoly of fuel and its accessories requested by Dangote. It is as a result of ‘Government go, Government come’. Look, before we start slaughter-ing the government, let us pulse to think of the deep side of this rela-tionship that has gone sour. Suc-cessive governments have been very kind and cooperative with Dangote and if this government is not, then it points to anomalies ranging from corruption, lack of due process, excessive govern-ment favours, personal disdain from the powers-that-be and more. Dangote is a political business man. He knows that. If you hob-nob with politicians as a business-man, then you will face the conse-quences in due season. Make no mistake about this government, it is not crying wolf where there is none. There has been excessive government support for Dangote to the disadvantage of co-compet-itors than prescribed by law. Gov-ernment can review such. This is where Dangote is having issues. Tinubu’s government is review-ing all successive governments’ support for Dangote to the detri-ment of the Nigerian people. It is deeper than you think. Now, back to the refinery, the Buhari government created the impression that Dangote mono-lithically aided the government by building this gigantic refinery which the government could not do for its people. Dangote saw himself in that light and prided himself so. But, the government changes. He ought to know that that is the fate of political busi-ness men. So, much has been said. The questions that come to my mind are as follows: Is it not true that Dangote had expected and posited to the government that he would have a monopoly exclusively of the industry? This is where the problem is. That can-not happen. Our lives cannot be held to ransom. This has been on for too long. The industries where Dangote excels had been monopo-lised for too long. Competition had been stifled and the spaces closed by governments akin to Dangote. There are people in Nigeria as well that could build refineries too. So, what happened to them? Why were they not allowed to do the same? Where are the likes of Dr Mike Adenuga? For instance, that man had been in the oil and gas business before Dangote and were he and others given the op-portunity? I feel for Dangote. He should have remained in his line of business rather than to switch to the Oil and Gas terrain. This terrain is too big and sublime. ‘Governments go, Governments come’ and the king that does not know Joseph will keep Joseph perpetually in jail. Government does not care when it tries to ei-ther right a wrong, or when it wants to deliberately bring down a person. I feel for Dangote. This government will not buy that re-finery. Trust me. Not this one. The call for public sympathy over gov-ernment perceived plans may not work as the evidence of a soured relationship is rife. Dangote must refrain from harassing the gov-ernment publicly and take on the path of negotiation. Governments do not care. Dangote Refinery is a private business. Period. How do you think the cabals in the oil sector could better be checked? I told you that the oil sector in Nigeria is too deep and sublime. It is characterised by characters, governments and cartels that span from Nigeria to different nations. Of course, herein lies the wealth of individuals and nations. A cabal that spans to regions and creeks, from waters to waters is beyond what you think. The oil producing countries, what do you classify them as? Cabal. You can-not check them. Only God can. We are all tied to their apron strings. Period. Do you think President Tinubu should relinquish his position as Minister of Petroleum and appoint a substantive Minister for proper supervision and control of the nation’s oil sector? Well, if Tinubu as Minister of Petroleum and President can, he should try. God will help him and it will be good for Nigeria. You saw the fight and sabotage they gave him over subsidy on fuel. The President has to oversee this ministry. Sincerely, leaving such an enormous ministry in the hands of one minister will not be good. The reasons deductible are that the President takes final decisions. What is your take on the court rein-statement of Philip Shuaibu as Edo State deputy governor and the attack on him during his return to the state in the company of the APC governorship candidate, during which a policeman was killed? The court reinstating Shaibu Philip, the impeached Deputy Governor of Edo State mirrors the beauty of democracy and the fluidity of our judicial system. It is a beauty to behold. The Appeal Court may again see it from a dif-ferent light. However, what does it matter? The man has moved to an-other party. So, he obviously has relinquished his position to that of a mere title. As to the attack at the Benin Airport, I will look at it collectively at first. It is a show of shame. I had been through your medium, Sunday Independent, ap-pealing to Edo politicians to deal with caution and not cause unnec-essary tension. I have watched a series of videos, including an unapproved forensic analysis on Tik Tok and it is sad how politi-cians can be shameless. They live in a state of nature. It is sad that the policeman had to die for such shameless people. I hear one side of the divide calling for the head of the Commissioner of Police in the State? Why? What has he done? Nigerian politicians are crooks. They possibly have seen that this police officer cannot be bought over now, so they planned ahead to remove him. I know that this Inspector General of Police is a man of integrity. Officers must be given the right environment to flourish in their jobs. Anyway, my condolences to the Nigeria Po-lice Force and the family of the deceased. Too long our police-men have suffered in the hands of these politicians, even to death. It has to stop. This is sad. On the defection of Philip Shaibu to the APC, I don’t see anything wrong in it? It is constitutionally right. He feels he can prostitute and so be it. There is nothing wrong. Then, some people say it was morally wrong and I ask them: What was their yardstick to measure the same? Some others said it was shameful and I said it depends on the individual. He decides if he wants shame or not. If eating his words and kneeling in the public with all the cameras rolling and paying obeisance of profligacy and prodigality to his master, Os-hiomhole, then to him, it is not a shame. Then so be it. And for me, if it is a shame, what does it mat-ter? I can only appeal to them. Let all those that matter in the state, starting from our most cherished and Respected Father, the Oba of Benin, set machinery in motion to call all involved to a table where peace will be discussed. Sadly, there is not one man like Bishop Benson Idahosa to call for peace among congregants. The Catho-lic Church in Edo State will be of value. Let peace reign. The Labour Party candidate is said to be making a lot of impact in his campaigns. Don’t you think the crisis between the APC and PDP will push Akpata ahead of the candidates of the two major parties? Concerning the Labour Party, it may turn out that two dogs fight for a bone and the third one comes and takes. But, again Edo Politics is too complex for this calculation. Some youth groups are planning peaceful nationwide protests against the poor state of the nation and the suffering in the land. How best do you think the Presidency and security agencies should handle the issue? The call for protests by youths is genuine. The constitution al-lows for peaceful protests. Things are bothersome and worrisome in Nigeria. Everyone feels it. The suf-fering is too much. Sometimes I think we should all be at par in our incomes so they can feel it. The disparity is too much. Now, to the point of the government’s reaction, I will say the govern-ment should provide security and protect them. Government should prepare officers to receive them. Government should go ahead of them to make it a jamboree and create fun instead of hate. The police and military should be al-lowed to mingle with them. Then, if they have leaders, speak to them using broadcast agencies. I think the era of the government trying to match it by force will be cata-strophic. These are your people. You can assuage them. You don’t beat a child and say don’t cry. How do you see the recent develop-ments in the USA presidential elec-tion, including the attack on Trump and the withdrawal of Biden and his nomination of his Vice? The recent attack on Donald Trump, the symbol of Democracy in the Republican Party, is sad and discouraging to emerging democ-racies. It was a show of shame by our tutors of democratic values. It humiliated sensitivities and created the impression of a brain-washed ideology. How else do you hate a man? With all the court cases only to stop him…So, this happens too in the USA? I thought it was only possible in Africa? It was even clear and suspicious that it was either pre-arranged or allowed to happen. I think they should know by now where God tailors this to. They created an emotional environment for Trump to Triumph. With blood stained face and fist clenched upwards…That emotion will lead to ballot victory. Joe Biden’s withdrawal was the best. I may not know about Kamala Harris. I also do know that a nomination of a VP by the Democrats to match the quality of JD Vance as Donald Trump’s pick will be the test of the game.","summary":" Bishop Dr Joseph Ighalo Edoro is an Edo State-born cleric, security expert and public affairs commentator.

Addressing a crowd of over 10,000 attendees at the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Tennessee, Trump, the Republican nominee for president, promised to make the United States a major hub for cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin if re-elected for a second term. He emphasized his vision for the U.S. to become a leading force in the cryptocurrency world, stating that under his administration, the value of Bitcoin could even surpass that of gold in the future. Trump also pledged to end what he called President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris’ so-called “war on crypto” — and to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Genlser, who is leading a regulatory crackdown on digital currency. “For three and a half years, the current administration has waged a war on crypto and Bitcoin like nobody’s ever seen before,” he said. He announcement to boot Gensler, if re-elected president, drew huge cheers from the crowd. Trump also pledged to appoint a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council to regulate the industry — but under new rules written by people “who love the industry” and want to help it grow. While president, Trump was a big skeptic of the crypto market, saying in 2019, “We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever. It is called the United States Dollar!” But he’s embraced digital currency in recent years, and his campaign began accepting donations in crypto in May. His running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), has introduced and supported pro-crypto legislation. Vance, a former venture capitalist, is a stakeholder in Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency backers are hopeful a Trump return to the White House will lead to Bitcoin becoming more mainstream. Earlier Saturday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro hit the campaign trail in the Keystone State to stump for Harris, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, while trying to move to the top of the list of frontrunners vying to become her choice for vice president. Harris, the 59-year-old vice president, is now embarking on a four-month sprint to the 2024 election after Democrats ousted Biden from the ticket and the 81-year-old endorsed her. Shapiro is widely viewed as a leading contender to become Harris’ running mate. He is popular in the Keystone State and viewed as a moderate who would balance out Harris — whose voting record as a senator made her the chamber’s most liberal, according to GovTrack. Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, a former NASA astronaut, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are also among the top contenders. Harris is expected to make her choice by Aug. 7. Harris’ schedule Saturday included attending a fundraiser in Pittsfield. Massachusetts., where she was expected to raise $1.4 million– a huge haul compared to the $400,000 organizers originally hope to score, according to Politico. The vice president later addressed a virtual conference to Voters of Tomorrow, a progressive organization representing Gen Z and Millennial voters that are among the more than a dozen youth groups that have pledged their support to Harris.

Vance: ‘just plain weird’","text":"US Vice-President Kamala Harris labelled statements by Donald Trump and his running mate J.D. Vance “weird” at her first fundraiser since US President Joe Biden quit the White House race, pursuing a line of attack that has taken off among Democrats since her ascent. Harris tried out the line on Saturday at a theatre in the Berkshires town of Pittsfield, Massachusetts, where she was introduced by singer James Taylor and supporters clapped and cheered during her speech. The event was expected to bring in more than US$1.4 million with some 800 attendees, according to the Harris campaign. The shift to Harris as the presumptive nominee has given Democrats a bump in the polls, but she reprised a line from Barack and Michelle Obama’s endorsement of her candidacy this week to inject a note of caution. “We are the underdogs in this race,” Harris told the crowd. “We have our work cut out for us. And this is not going to be easy.” In calling out the Republican nominee, Harris did not specify which comments, past or recent, by Trump and Vance she had in mind. A 2021 comment by Vance disparaging “childless cat ladies” drew criticism this week from Democrats as well as some Republicans. “You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record, and some of what he and his running mate are saying, well, it’s just plain weird,” the vice-president said. “I mean, that’s the box you put that in, right?” As Harris arrived, people outside the venue held signs saying “Trump is weird” and “If my cat could vote, she would vote for you.” In her speech, Harris challenged Trump to join her for a previously scheduled debate on September 10, now that Biden has dropped out. Trump’s campaign said on Thursday that those plans cannot be finalised until her party formally picks its nominee. A crucial decision still awaits Harris: picking a running mate. Arizona Senator Mark Kelly, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are on a short list, people familiar with the process said this week.","summary":"The US vice-president cast herself as the underdog in the White House race and once again challenged her Republican rival to debate her.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3272168/kamala-harris-tests-new-attack-trump-and-jd-vance-just-plain-weird","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/07/28/8428e830-a0d5-4a2f-92ae-2d51e74615f6_45be9a8a.jpg","video":"https://storage.scmp.com/d8/cors_uploads/2024/07/22/web%20video.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-27 23:19:19","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.029},{"id":252783446,"title":"“Harris Hosts Inaugural Fundraiser as Presumptive Democratic Nominee Gains Support from Donors”","text":"WASHINGTON – Vice President Kamala Harris used her first fundraiser since becoming the Democrats’ likely White House nominee to excoriate the Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump as determined to roll back Americans’ freedoms. Harris traveled to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday where she was expected to raise more than $1.4 million, her campaign announced, from an audience of hundreds at the Colonial Theatre. That would be $1 million-plus more than the original goal set for the event before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. She told an excited group of supporters that she entered the race as an “underdog,” while expressing confidence that her surging campaign could defeat Trump. “I will fight to move our nation forward,” Harris said. “Donald Trump intends to take our country backwards.” Harris also poked at Trump, and his running mate Sen. JD Vance, for lobbing peculiar attacks at her and other Democrats. The vice president appeared to be alluding to a 2021 interview with Vance in which he slammed some prominent Democrats without biological children, including Harris, as “childless cat ladies” with “no direct stake” in America. “You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record and some of what he and his running mate are saying, it is just plain weird,” Harris said. “I mean that’s the box you put that in, right?” Harris’ branding the Republican ticket as “weird” appears to be part of a concerted effort by her campaign to spotlight some of Trump and Vance’s rhetoric as questionable. Earlier this week, the Harris campaign on the social media site X called Vance “weird and creepy” for some of his stances on women’s reproductive rights. Trump, meanwhile, has raised the fictional serial killer Hannibal Lecter from the film “Silence of the Lambs” in stump speeches. “These guys are just weird,” Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, a Democrat who is on Harris’ shortlist for vice president, said in an MSNBC interview earlier this week. “They’re running for He-man women-haters club or something.” Supporters for the fundraiser included musician James Taylor and many of the state’s Democratic heavyweights, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, former Gov. Deval Patrick and Rep. Richie Neal. Harris took in more than $100 million in donations in the first 48 hours after Biden quit the race, a presidential record, and aides said she has continued to raise money at a steady clip. “This is a people-powered campaign,” Harris said. “And we have momentum.” Harris, a former prosecutor in her home state of California, also derided Trump for his legal troubles. She noted his recent conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records in New York, a jury finding the former president of being liable for sexual abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, and a $25 million settlement paid to attendees of the now-defunct real estate seminar called Trump University. “I’ve been dealing with people like him my entire career,” Harris said. She added, “So in this campaign, and I say in all seriousness, I will proudly put my record against his any day.” Harris began her remarks with praise for Biden, who opted to end his reelection bid and endorse Harris last weekend after his campaign fell into a tailspin following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Trump. She called Biden’s legacy of accomplishment over the past three and a half years “unmatched in modern history.” Trump denigrated Harris as a “radical left lunatic” who wants to defund the police during a keynote address at a bitcoin conference in Nashville on Saturday. He said she was worse than Biden but was probably his second preference for a candidate to run against after Biden. Trump told the crowd of bitcoin supporters that he would embrace the cryptocurrency more than the Biden-Harris administration has and vowed to “replace the Biden-Harris economic stagnation” with an economic boom. The vice president told supporters at her Massachusetts fundraiser that her economic agenda would sharply contrast with Trump’s, who she claimed is squarely focused on lowering tax rates for wealthy Americans and improving the bottom lines of corporations. “Building up the middle class will be the defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said. She added, “Let us make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Our campaign has always been about two very different visions for our nation.” ___ Associated Press writer Ali Swenson in New York contributed to this report.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWASHINGTON – Vice President Kamala Harris used her first fundraiser since becoming&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: &#8220;Harris Hosts Inaugural Fundraiser as Presumptive Democratic Nominee Gains Support from Donors&#8221; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/harris-hosts-inaugural-fundraiser-as-presumptive-democratic-nominee-gains-support-from-donors/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Harris-holds-her-first-fundraiser-as-the.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 23:16:14","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.234},{"id":252783478,"title":"Trump pledges to make US ‘the crypto capital of the planet’ during speech at world’s largest Bitcoin conference","text":"Donald Trump headlined the world’s largest Bitcoin conference on Saturday, a strategic move aimed at positioning himself as the presidential candidate who will help the embattled industry avoid overreaching federal scrutiny.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Chikamso Chukwuenyem For Mailonline Published:00:02 BST, 28 July 2024 |Updated:00:09 BST, 28 July 2024 e-mail 17 shares 1 View comments Photos of a Hollywood star representing Team GB in diving at the 1990 Commonwealth Games resurfaced on Saturday. Then 23, the sportsman-turned-actor trialled for a spot in the 1988 and 1992 Olympics but unfortunately failed both times. He made the move from diving to modelling, and then to acting in music videos, until he eventually became gritty Hollywood hard man he is known as today. So, have you guessed who it is? Photos of a then-23-year-old Hollywood star representing Team GB in diving at the 1990 Commonwealth Games resurfaced on Saturday Before he became Hollywood's action favourite, Jason Statham, 57, was an avid diver who tried and failed to qualify for Team GB at the 1988 and 1992 Olympics It's Jason Statham! Over the course of his acting career, Jason has gone from playing cockney gangsters to one of the world's most recognisable action stars. In 1998, he made his acting debut in the Guy Ritchie project Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. But before the glitz and the glamour, Jason was nearing the pinnacle of something very different. Read More Jason Statham competed in diving at the 1990 Commonwealth Games in Auckland Eight years prior to that, Jason found himself in Auckland competing at the Commonwealth Games. Representing England, the Death Race star was actually a professional diver. It was an admirable attempt from Jason who actually performed across three separate events. He secured a top-10 finish in the one-metre springboard, and followed that up with two 11th places in the three and 10-metre platforms respectively. Jason has given credit to his career in sports as part of the reason he has been so successful on the big screen, telling the BBC in 2008: 'I think what I didn't achieve [in sports] helped me focus more and take my acting career more seriously.' While many may not have known about Jason's past as a diver, his interest in sport will come as less of a shock. Jason made the move from diving to modelling, and then to acting in music videos, until he eventually became gritty Hollywood hard man he is known as today. Jason has credited a high diver he saw during as a child while he was on a family holiday as the reason he got into diving Despite the diving career not working out, Jason has enjoyed great success through his acting and personal life (pictured with his long-time partner Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 37, in April) Showcased in so many of his films, the Derbyshire-born star has practiced martial arts including kickboxing and karate. But his love for diving began as a young teen which he accredits to seeing a high dive in Miami. Read More 2024 Paris Olympics RECAP: Impressive Adam Peaty cruises into 100m final on superb first day Jason told Olympics.com in 2023: 'I was on holiday in Florida with my mum and dad and there was this guy who used to do a high dive at noon every day from one of the hotels we stayed in. 'And I said: \"When we get home, I am going to do that.\" 'I joined the club then, I was like 11 or 12 years old. Within a year, I was part of the British team and it gained momentum and speed and I spent the next 10 years doing that.' His hard work and dedication in his early years would pay off as he was inducted into the British National Diving School in 1985 earning the right to represent Great Britain and England at international competitions. But a place at the Olympics would never materialise for the Hollywood star; after attempts at the Summer Games in Seoul and Barcelona respectively. And, despite appearing in many hits over the course of his acting career including The Expendables, Transformers and the Fast & Furious franchise, grossing billions of dollars, missing out on the Olympics remains a regret. Jason Statham was inducted into the British National Diving School in 1985 Despite two attempts at qualifying for the Olympics, he wasn't able to qualify for either the 1988 or 1992 Summer Games Read More Braless Rosie Huntington-Whiteley heads out with fiancé Jason Statham on his birthday 'It's a bit of a sore point that I never got to the Olympics,' Jason Statham said after Jack Laugher and Chris Mears became the first Brits to win an Olympic gold medal in diving at Rio 2016. 'They deserve it. The divers now are just terrific. I started too late. It probably wasn't my thing. I should have done a different sport.' The 2024 Olympic Games kicked off in Paris on Friday with Celine Dion delighting everyone with a surprise performance. Meanwhile, Jason, who turned 57 on Friday, is far away from the action, enjoying some quality time with his fiancée, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, 37, in LA.

The former president even offered them a high-profile government scalp as he gave a speech to the Bitcoin 2024 conference in Nashville on Saturday. ‘On day one I will fire Gary Gensler,’ he told the crowd, speaking of the Securities and Exchange Commission chairman. Trump received so much applause from the crowd that he repeated his pledge, adding, ‘I didn’t know he was that unpopular’. Gensler would be replaced with someone friendly to crypto investors, and he would create a crypto advisory council to design regulatory guidance. The Bitcoin price crashed to less than $67,000 as soon as Trump started speaking, but rallied to $69,000 over the next hour when investors heard his pro-crypto speech. Trump made numerous promises to make the US the world’s ‘crypto capital’, in contrast with President Joe Biden’s efforts to strongly regulate it. ‘I pledge to the Bitcoin community, the day I take the oath of office, Joe Biden’s and Kamala Harris’s anti-crypto crusade will be over. It will end. It will be done,’ he said. ‘The moment I’m sworn in, the persecution stops and the weaponization ends against your industry.’ He warned that if Vice President Harris won ‘every one of you will be gone. They will be vicious. They will be ruthless. They will do things that you wouldn’t believe’. ‘Kamala is worse than Joe, she is a radical, lunatic, she is against crypto. Now a little honeymoon period is going on,’ he added. Trump’s embracing of cryptocurrency is a sharp turn from just three years ago when he railed against it, and even top crypto boosters admit the former president is ‘pandering’ to them to win votes. ‘Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam,’ Trump said in 2021, calling it ‘another currency competing against the dollar’. ‘I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air,’ he said in 2019, linking it to drug sales and criminals. ‘We have only one real currency in the USA, and it is stronger than ever. It is called the United States Dollar!’ But wealthy donors, and Trump’s desire to be president again no matter, what fueled a road to Damascus conversion he hopes will give him an edge. In Nashville, he tried to sell himself as ‘the crypto president’ in contrast to Harris, who allegedly privately told a donor ‘Bitcoin is money for criminals’. ‘This is the steel industry of 100 years ago,’ Trump claimed. ‘If we don’t do it, China and others are going to be doing it. Let’s do it right. If crypto is going to define the future, I want to be mined, minted, and made in the USA. ‘It’s not going to be made anywhere else. And if bitcoin is going to the moon, as we say… I want America to be the nation that leads the way, and that’s what’s going to happen. So you’re going to be very happy with me.’ Trump outlined his plan to create a framework for the expansion of stable coins, and promised to keep all the crypto the US Government owned. He would then expand those holdings to create a ‘strategic national Bitcoin stockpile’. “America’s laws are too unclear, and too tough, and too angry and too stiff,’ he said. Trump would also end Treasury Department efforts to create a central bank digital currency, which would compete with Bitcoin and others. ‘There will never be a CBDC while I’m president of the United States,’ he said. Trump’s about-face on cryptocurrency followed investors poring tens of millions into his campaign coffers, and Americans sending $4 million in crypto donations. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, who famously sued Mark Zuckerberg for stealing their idea for Facebook, each pledged $1 million to his campaign. They each also sent $250,000 the Elon Musk’s America PAC, which funnels money to the Trump campaign. Tyler Winklevoss, in a 1,417-word rant on Twitter, claimed the Biden Administration ‘openly declared war against crypto’ and endorsed Trump for president. ‘It’s time for the crypto army to send a message to Washington. That attacking us is political suicide,’ he wrote. He claimed Biden ‘weaponized multiple government agencies to bully, harass, and sue the good actors in our industry in an effort to destroy it’. ‘This administration’s actions have been nothing short of an unprecedented abuse of power wielded entirely for twisted political gain at the complete expense of innovation, the American taxpayer, and the American economy.’ Winklevoss and other crypto boosters also got into a fight with Harris after she declined an invitation to speak at Saturday’s event in Nashville. ‘The Biden-Harris Administration wages all-out war on the crypto industry for four years,’ he wrote on Twitter. ‘Despite all of this, Kamala is still invited to the The Bitcoin Conf[erence] in Nashville and given a chance to speak to our industry and reset the relationship. ‘What does she do? She declines. She can’t even take the first step and show up to start mending fences. ‘Our industry won’t forget this.

JD Vance. The Republican senator from Ohio is Trump’s running mate as the 45th president hopes to regain the White House. Vance’s Secret Service code name is “Bobcat,” according to the Daily Mail, citing a friend of Vance’s. Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump-Vance campaign for comment as well as to the Secret Service. Secret Service code names are given to presidents, vice presidents, first ladies and other high-profile persons under the agency’s protection. They once had a real cloak-and-dagger purpose to help protect the nation’s top leaders. But these days, in the era of encrypted technology, the names are largely ceremonial and used for ease of communication in fast, high-pressure situations. Code names are selected by “sheer whim,” a Secret Service spokesperson once told The Washington Post. But they do appear to have some connection to the individual’s personal history or heritage. And note the alliteration of code names within families, said to be tradition. Here’s a look at some known Secret Service code names, as reported by Britannica and other sources. Bobcat Vice presidential candidate Vance. “Bobcats” is the nickname for both Ohio University and Breathitt County High School, in Jackson, Kentucky, the family hometown Vance profiled in “Hilbilly Elegy,” his bestselling 2016 memoir. Capri First lady Jill Biden, married to Celtic. Celtic President Joe Biden. He was Renegade’s vice president when he first earned a code name that pays tribute to his Irish roots. Dancer First lady Rosalynn Carter, married to Deacon. Her other code name was Lotus Petal. Deacon President Jimmy Carter. It “reflected his deeply religious faith,” noted Britannica. Eagle President Bill Clinton. “Some speculated that the code name concerned his association with the Boy Scouts,” said Britannica, given that “Eagle Scout” is the organization’s top rank. Evergreen First lady Hillary Clinton, married to Eagle. Hoosier Vice President Mike Pence. He hails from Indiana — the Hoosier State. Hummingbird Second lady Karen Pence, married to Hoosier. Lace First lady Jackie Kennedy. A tribute, apparently, to her elegant style and an alliteration with her husband’s code name. Lancer President John F. Kennedy. The “code name was apt, given that his administration was often compared to Camelot … of which Lancelot was a legendary knight,” according to Britannica. Lyric Caroline Kennedy. A prophetic nickname: President Kennedy’s daughter was the inspiration for Neil Diamond’s sing-a-long hit, “Sweet Caroline,” written in 1969, six years after her father was assassinated. Muse First lady Melania Trump, married to Mogul. Perhaps a tribute to the former model’s inspirational beauty. Mogul President Donald Trump. He wanted the code name “Humble,” Britannica said, adding that “the Secret Service opted for something … a little less humble.” Passkey President Gerald Ford, who succeeded Nixon. Pioneer Vice president Kamala Harris, who reportedly picked the name in August 2020 shortly after, like Vance, she was tapped as a VP candidate. Rainbow First lady Nancy Reagan, married to Rawhide. Rawhide President Ronald Reagan. Reagan appeared in several westerns and often wore a cowboy hat while campaigning to be governor of California. Renaissance First lady Michelle Obama, married to Renegade. Renegade President Barack Obama. He “opted for this moniker after being presented with a list of names beginning with the letter ‘R,’” Time magazine reported in 2021. Searchlight President Richard Nixon. His Secret Service nickname “is deeply ironic,” Time magazine and others reported, given the Watergate scandal that brought down Nixon’s presidency. Sunburn Sen. Ted Kennedy. “The pale, Irish-Catholic New Englander had to suffer this code name” while running for president in 1980, according to Time Magazine. Tempo First lady Laura Bush, married to Trailblazer (see two names down). Timberwolf President George H.W. Bush. Perhaps the top-dog nickname is an homage to his role as patriarch of a political dynasty. Trailblazer President George W. Bush. A “complimentary” code name, Britannica noted. Tranquility First lady Barbara Bush and mother of another president. “Snowbank” was apparently an alternate code name for her. Tumbler Also used for George W. Bush, when his father Timberwolf was president.","summary":"As the Secret Service continues to face scrutiny and outrage after former President Donald Trump was nearly killed, the agency reportedly has issued a new code name for vice presidential candidate Sen.

When asked how the Trump campaign will handle leftist claims that voting against Harris is racist or sexist in nature, Leavitt dismissed those narratives as nonsense. “That’s a whole bunch of nonsense that’s been peddled in the last couple of weeks by the mainstream media, and I don’t think the American people are going to buy that,” she predicted, explaining that opposing Harris has “nothing to do with race or gender.” “It has everything to do with competence, and Kamala Harris has proven to be just as incompetent as Joe Biden,” Leavitt said, explaining that Harris has supported every single one of Biden’s “disastrous” policies. “The wide open southern border, a weak foreign policy that led to war in Ukraine and strengthened Iranian-backed terrorists in the Middle East to attack Israel,” she began, noting that Harris also “supported every single one of Joe Biden’s terrible economic policies that created the worst inflation crisis in a generation.” LISTEN: She also said Harris has to answer for her “terribly dangerously liberal record as a United States senator from the very liberal state of California,” referencing the GovTrack ranking showing Harris as the most liberal senator in 2019, which the website has since pulled after asserting the data is now conveniently “not sufficient to create a reliable portrait of the activity of legislators.” “We will make sure every voter knows where Kamala Harris stands on the issue. She is to the left of Bernie Sanders. She’s dangerously liberal. We cannot afford her leadership in the Oval Office, and that will be our goal between now and Election Day for the next 101 days, to ensure every voter knows how radically liberal Kamala Harris is,” she said, adding that the Trump campaign is “more confident than ever” that “President Trump will be victorious once we get that message across to every American voter.” The efforts of the establishment media to portray Harris as a “moderate Democrat” are simply not true, she continued, emphasizing that Harris has “enabled” and supported all of Biden’s policies at the border, overseeing “the worst immigration crisis in our nation’s history.” “She and Biden have allowed more than 11 million illegal immigrants from all over this country, known terrorist criminals who have gone on to commit heinous crimes in our communities, killing and raping women and many other heinous crimes in every state across the country,” Leavitt said, reminding listeners that Harris “also proudly stated that she was the last person in the room when Joe Biden oversaw the disastrous, unforgivable withdrawal from Afghanistan that left 13 service members dead.” “She has stood by his decision and has said she is proud of him for that withdrawal. There is nothing to be proud of. We lost brave men and women, and, now, of course, Afghanistan has, once again, become a haven for terrorism. The Taliban is parading around with our military equipment and our soldiers’ uniforms. It is a disgrace, and Kamala Harris is proud of that,” she said. “For that alone, she does not deserve one vote from the American public. She has zero foreign policy experience. Again, she is dangerously liberal, and…there is zero doubt that America will be a more dangerous place if she is allowed to be president for four years.” – News Saturday airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. Eastern.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIssues with Vice President Kamala Harris, whom President Joe Biden has tapped&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Insider Interview with Karoline Leavitt: Concerns about Kamala Harris Being &#8216;Extremely Liberal&#8217; Not Connected to Race or Gender first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/insider-interview-with-karoline-leavitt-concerns-about-kamala-harris-being-extremely-liberal-not-connected-to-race-or-gender/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-Exclusive-—-Karoline-Leavitt-Issues-with-Dangerously.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 22:53:40","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.204},{"id":252782718,"title":"Donald Trump Makes Five Major Pledges to Cryptocurrency Industry","text":"Former President Donald Trump took center stage at the Bitcoin Conference in Nashville, Tennessee, on Saturday making major promises to the cryptocurrency industry and solidifying his position as the crypto candidate for the 2024 presidential election.Speaking before a packed hall of over 3,000 attendees, the former president's remarks signaled a dramatic shift in his stance on digital assets and highlighted the growing influence of the powerful crypto voting bloc within his own party.Here are five pledges Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, made to the cryptocurrency industry.Vowed to Fight Inflation With Crypto-Friendly PoliciesTrump positioned bitcoin as a potential hedge against rising inflation, aligning with growing voter concerns about the economy.He emphasized on Saturday the importance of embracing cryptocurrency as a tool to combat inflationary pressures and said, \"Bitcoin stands for freedom, sovereignty and independence from government coercion and control.\"\"Our nation has never thrived by trying to censor new ideas and shut down the dreams of our people,\" he said.Promised to Encourage Innovation in Power Plants and Electrical Vehicle SectorWhile specific details were limited, Trump hinted at policies that would encourage the use of excess energy from power plants for bitcoin mining and explore synergies between the cryptocurrency industry and the electric vehicle (EV) sector. This pledge aligns with the growing interest in sustainable crypto mining practices and the potential for blockchain technology to revolutionize the energy sector.Pledged to Fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary GenslerIn a move that drew thunderous applause, Trump promised, \"On day one, I will fire Gary Gensler,\" referring to the current Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). He vowed to roll back limitations imposed under the Biden administration, characterizing them as an \"anti-crypto crusade.\" This pledge resonates with many in the crypto community who view current SEC policies as overly restrictive.However, presidents cannot directly fire SEC commissioners, which could complicate the implementation of this promise if Trump is reelected in November.Newsweek contacted Gensler's office via email for comment on Saturday.Committed to Ending \"Operation Choke Point 2.0\"Trump announced plans to create \"a bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council\" if he takes office.\"The rules will be written by people who love your industry, not hate your industry,\" the former president said. This commitment suggests a more collaborative approach to crypto regulation, with industry insiders having a seat at the table.The proposed council could potentially shape policies that are more favorable to cryptocurrency innovation and adoption. Additionally, Trump pledged to end what he called \"Operation Choke Point 2.0,\" referring to perceived efforts by federal regulators to discourage banks from working with crypto companies.This promise addresses a key concern in the crypto community about access to traditional banking services and suggests a more crypto-friendly regulatory environment under a potential Trump administration.Guaranteed to Keep Bitcoin Leadership in AmericaThe former president vowed to ensure U.S. leadership in cryptocurrency, warning that if America doesn't take the lead, \"China will do it.\" This pledge aligns with Trump's long-standing \"America First\" economic policies and taps into concerns about maintaining U.S. technological supremacy. Trump emphasized the need for America to stay at the forefront of cryptocurrency development, framing it as a matter of national economic security.These promises mark a stark reversal from Trump's previous positions on cryptocurrencies. During his presidency, he tweeted in 2019 that he was \"not a fan\" of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, describing their value as \"based on thin air.\"Newsweek contacted Trump's campaign via email on Saturday for comment.Trump's recent change of heart and embrace of crypto has energized the industry, with many viewing the upcoming election as a critical opportunity to reshape what they perceive as hostile U.S. regulations. The former president didn't shy away from partisan rhetoric, warning that a Democratic victory would be disastrous for the crypto industry.\"If they win this election, every one of you will be gone. They will be vicious. They will be ruthless,\" Trump cautioned on Saturday.On Saturday morning, more than 20 Democratic lawmakers, including Vice President Kamala Harris, reportedly signed a statement calling for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to pivot away from the anti-bitcoin policies associated with Senator Elizabeth Warren.Warren said during an interview in May that she was \"concerned about anyone in Congress who is not worried about the threat posed by Iran and North Korea and their use of crypto,\" and has gone on record with an anti-cryptocurrency crusade.This shift in Democratic stance is reportedly influenced by recent polling data, the Republican Party's pro-bitcoin policies, and Trump's high-profile appearance at the Bitcoin Conference. The move suggests a growing recognition within the Democratic Party of the potential electoral significance of crypto-friendly policies.As the first U.S. president to appear at a bitcoin event, Trump's presence underscores the increasing importance of cryptocurrency in the political landscape. His newfound support for the industry, coupled with the Biden administration's perceived hostility, has led many traditionally Democratic voters in the tech and finance sectors to consider supporting Trump this year.However, with the Democrats' apparent change of heart, the political landscape surrounding cryptocurrency regulation appears increasingly fluid. As Harris emerges as the likely Democratic nominee after President Joe Biden dropped out of the race on Sunday and endorsed her, Harris' signature on the pro-crypto statement signals a potential major shift in the party's approach.","summary":"\"Crypto is the steel industry of 100 years ago, you're just in your infancy.

Trump said — to rapturous applause from the Nashville crowd — that if elected, he would fire current Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler, whom the crypto world has come to view as its chief opponent in government due to his agency’s rulings on digital tokens and lawsuits against bitcoin exchanges. “I will appoint an SEC chair who will build the future, not block the future,” Trump said. His embrace of crypto comes amid high-profile endorsements from bitcoin advocates including Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the twin brothers best known for suing Mark Zuckerberg over the creation of Facebook and who founded the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange. Trump’s remarks stand to further cement his growing alliance with other right-leaning figures in the tech world, though the novelty of his appearance at the conference was not lost on him. As he praised the audience as “geniuses,” he acknowledged he was still learning about crypto. “Most people have no idea what the hell it is,” he quipped. “So what happens when everyone figures it out? That’ll be something.” Trump offered up a proposal to create a national bitcoin “stockpile” that he said would serve as a “permanent national asset,” though stopped short of offering many details. The idea of creating a strategic crypto reserve has caught on quickly among bitcoin supporters. On Friday, independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. also proposed creating a bitcoin reserve, saying he would direct the Treasury to purchase 4 million bitcoins, which in today’s prices would equate to approximately $272 billion. Immediately following Trump’s remarks, Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said she would introduce a bill to create the reserve. However, the price of bitcoin fell slightly in the wake of Trump’s remarks Saturday, perhaps reflecting crypto traders’ unmet expectations for a more definitive commitment on the reserve idea from the presidential candidate. While the Bitcoin Conference is officially apolitical, Trump’s speech punctuated an event whose politico panelists leaned Republican, including four sitting GOP senators and three GOP Senate candidates. The sole elected Democrat, California Rep. Ro Khanna, spoke early Saturday and criticized the tendency within his own party to further entrench traditional centers of finance. “I thought the Democrats were opposed to monopoly power. … We don’t want the banks and the Fed to have a monopoly on fast payments,” Khanna said at a panel Saturday. Shortly after his morning remarks, Bitcoin Magazine reported that a group of Democratic representatives and candidates had sent a letter to the Democratic National Committee urging party leaders to be more supportive of crypto. In addition to Khanna, the letter’s signatories included representatives in purple districts in critical swing states like North Carolina and Arizona. The current administration’s “hostility,” the signees said, does not reflect “our Party’s progressive, forward-looking, and inclusive values.” “A refreshed leader of the ticket represents an opportunity to change that perception,” they wrote. In a follow-up interview with NBC News at the conference, Khanna said that positively engaging with the crypto community would be in keeping with Democrats’ desire to be “the party of the future.” “They’re passionate, they’re active on social media, and they’re mobilized,” Khanna said. “And it’s a community that’s going to vote.” Conference organizers say Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris declined an invitation to appear at the conference. The organizers declined to comment further on the matter, though conference head David Bailey criticized Harris’ absence on X. Harris’ campaign has not commented. In an interview with NBC News on Friday, Bailey said that despite Harris not appearing at the conference, the window had not closed on Democrats’ ability to win support from the crypto community. “There’s a whole progressive case for bitcoin,” he said. While that rationale may not have received as much notice, Bailey said, “my intuition is, over the next four years, it will.” On Saturday, the Financial Times reported Harris had approached top crypto companies seeking a “reset” of relations, citing unnamed sources. Bailey said it would ultimately become a political necessity for all political parties to engage with bitcoin supporters as a political bloc. “It’s not too late — in fact, everyone will have to come to terms with it,” he said. “They won’t be viable otherwise.” Outside the conference early Saturday, pro-Trump bitcoin supporters made their presence known. Chad Kozman, an Ohio resident, sported a “Free Ross/Vote Trump” shirt, referring to the community’s desire to see Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht’s life sentence on drug and money-laundering charges commuted, something Trump has promised he would do. Kozman told NBC News that while Trump’s overtures to the crypto community were opportunistic, it was also a sign that the community had matured beyond its individualistic roots into a voting group that had to be reckoned with. “For the bitcoin community, it’s been a really hard road to get people to see the benefits of collectivization and pulling together,” he said.","summary":"NASHVILLE, Tenn. — Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump promised to make America the world leader in bitcoin and other digital currencies if elected, likening the crypto-verse to “the steel industry of 100 years ago.”","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-hails-crypto-largest-bitcoin-conference-rcna163925","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-07/240727-Trump-Bitcoin-Nashville-aa-447p-3d23dd.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 22:35:26","author":"Rob Wile","authors":["Rob Wile"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.19},{"id":252783580,"title":"Donald Trump Backs ‘Strategic Bitcoin Stockpile’ in Speech to Crypto Faithful","text":"Former president Donald Trump has outlined a plan to turbocharge crypto growth and make the US a crypto mining powerhouse in his keynote address to the 2024 Nashville Bitcoin Conference on Saturday. Trump announced that if he is elected, he will create a strategic bitcoin reserve in the US. “It will be the policy of my administration to keep 100 percent of all bitcoin the US government currently holds or acquires in the future…as a core of the strategic national bitcoin stockpile,” he said. Right now, the US government owns more than 210,000 bitcoins that were seized via illegal operations like the online dark market Silk Road to the ponzi scheme BitConnect. It’s worth approximately $14 billion at time of writing. This move confirmed rumors spread by bitcoin enthusiasts who were hopeful that endorsement of a reserve from Trump could bolster the price of the cryptocurrency. Trump also announced plans to appoint a bitcoin and crypto advisory council, whose task will be to “design transparent regulatory guidance to the benefit of your industry,” in the first 100 days of his next presidency. He said that he wanted the US to become the “crypto capital of the world.” Trump also pledged to create a framework for ensuring the safe expansion of stablecoins, \"allowing us to extend the dominance of the USD to other places around the world,” and doubled down on his vow to scrap any effort to create a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or digital dollar, saying “there will never be a CBDC while I’m president of the United States.” “I will always defend the right to self-custody,” he told the exultant crowd. What got perhaps the biggest cheer was a day one promise to fire SEC Chairman Gary Gensler. “The moment I am sworn in, the persecution stops and the weaponization against your industry ends,” he said, name-checking Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts as the industry’s sworn enemy. He promised to make regulations friendly to crypto mining operations in the US, so workers wouldn’t have to “move to China.” Trump promised, again, to free Ross Ulbricht, imprisoned for life for his involvement with online underground market Silk Road, where people could buy items like illegal drugs before it was shut down in 2013. The crowd expected the bitcoin strategic reserve announcement. On July 22, senator Cynthia Lummis of Wyoming posted “Big things…in store this week” on X, two days before Fox Business reported that she would “announce legislation for a strategic bitcoin reserve” at the conference. Lummis appeared before the crowd just after Trump walked off to announce a “present to President Donald Trump”—the bitcoin reserve bill that she’d been drafting. “This is our Louisiana Purchase moment,” she said, elaborating that the bill would take “the bitcoin President Trump just mentioned and pull it into the reserve, [and] that’s only the beginning. Over five years, the United States will assemble 1 million bitcoin, five percent of the world’s bitcoin, and it will be held for a minimum of 20 years and can be used for one purpose—reduce our debt.” The bill further provides that the US will “convert excess reserves at our twelve federal reserve banks into bitcoin over five years,” so that instead of holding a depreciating asset (the US dollar, which she says has been “designed to debase at least 2 percent per year”), we’ll be holding an asset with potential for growth. There’s no arguing that the value of bitcoin has increased over time, though it’s no higher now than it was before Trump’s keynote. It peaked around $69,000 this morning and, as of just after Trump’s talk, sits around $68,400. Trump announcing his desire to add bitcoin to the country’s strategic reserve doesn’t mean it necessarily will, even if he is elected. Ari Paul, founder of BlockTower Capital, an institutional investment firm specializing in crypto, took to X about a week before the conference to put the odds of a bitcoin strategic reserve happening in the next four years at “ten to one.” The US Federal Reserve currently includes assets like gold and foreign (fiat) currencies. They’re used as credit lines to keep the US economy stable, particularly in times of crisis. Many in the crypto community have criticized it for encouraging the US Treasury to “print money” during Covid-19, which has led to lasting inflation. Adding bitcoin to the reserve could, per Lummis, “can cut our debt in half.” Trump has drastically changed his tone about bitcoin from his time as president, when he said it “seems like scam. He’s since described himself as “good” with crypto. On Saturday he praised the crowd as “high-IQ individuals” as opposed to the “low-IQ individual” he’s running against (referring to presidential candidate Kamala Harris.) He credited the room with predicting inflation: “You understand inflation more than anyone else,” he said. “They didn’t listen to you.” Trump’s running mate, Republican senator J.D. Vance of Ohio, is also a fan of crypto. He reported owning between $100,000 and $250,000 in cryptocurrencies in 2022. As of the start of the Bitcoin Conference on July 25, Trump had reportedly received around $4 million worth of cryptocurrencies in campaign donations, in Bitcoin, Ether, Ripple, and the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin USDC. And because of that, we might be at the mercy of Trump. “Bitcoin is not threatening the dollar. The behavior of the current US Government is threatening the dollar,” he said. “The danger to our financial future does not come from crypto, it comes from Washington, DC.”","summary":"Appearing onstage at the Bitcoin 2024 conference, Trump also promised to “fire” SEC chair Gary Gensler, set up a crypto advisory council, and make the United States the “crypto capital of the world.”","url":"https://www.wired.com/story/donald-trump-strategic-bitcoin-stockpile-bitcoin-2024/","image":"https://media.wired.com/photos/66a55d590971fc8e49c7ac09/16:9/w_2400,h_1350,c_limit/Trump-Crypto-Conference-Business-2163287644.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 22:32:53","author":"Jessica Klein","authors":["Jessica Klein"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.002},{"id":252783394,"title":"Robinson-Regis: Kamala Harris candidacy a historic milestone","text":"AMERICANS head to the polls in 100 days. Kamala Devi Harris, who is the first black woman since 1972 to run for president, is gearing up as the leading contender for the Democratic Party to challenge former president Donald Trump. Late US politician Shirley Chisholm made history in 1972 after becoming the first black woman to compete for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination. Harris was born in Oakland, California. She is a graduate of Howard University and University of California, Hastings. In 2020 she was elected the 49th vice president of the United States as Joe Biden's running mate. She is the first female vice president and the highest-ranking female official in the country's history. Harris is also the first African American and first South Asian American vice president of the US. She will turn 60 on October 20, 17 days before Americans go to the polls on November 5. On July 21, President Biden, who was under pressure from his party owing to failing health, dropped out of the 2024 race for the White House, quickly endorsing Harris to take on former president Donald Trump. Biden encouraged his party to unite behind her. After announcing that he will not seek the presidential re-election, Biden said he will fully support Harris for the Democratic nomination. “My very first decision as the party nominee in 2020 was to pick Kamala Harris as my vice president. And it’s been the best decision I’ve made. Today, I want to offer my full support and endorsement for Kamala to be the nominee of our party this year.” Meanwhile, Harris said she was “honoured” to receive Biden’s endorsement, describing the president’s decision not to seek re-election as “selfless and patriotic act.” Stressing Biden’s patriotism, Harris noted that Biden was “putting the American people and our country above everything else.” “I will do everything in my power to unite the Democratic Party – and unite our nation – to defeat Donald Trump and his extreme Project 2025 agenda,” she pledged in a statement. Arouca/Maloney MP and leader of the PNM Women's League, Camille Robinson-Regis, told Newsday via WhatsApp on July 26, while only Americans can decide what is best for their country, the significance of Harris's candidacy as a black woman is \"undeniable, marking a historic milestone in American politics.\" She wishes Harris well in her pursuit. \"As a woman in politics, I applaud any woman who makes politics her career. As a Trinbagonian politician, I would not venture to answer questions on US thinking or Kamala’s priorities. I know what she has said are her priorities, and I wish her every success.\" She said TT must mind our own business when the time comes for our general elections, which are slated for 2025. Robinson-Regis stressed citizens must \"choose wisely, just as the American voters will mind their own and choose wisely.\" She concluded her message, wishing Harris success in her campaign. \"She made history in 2020 and I hope she makes history again in 2024.” “Before I was elected vice president, before I was elected United States senator, I was the elected attorney general of California. And before that, I was a courtroom prosecutor.” Harris said this at her first campaign event in Wilmington, Delaware. “In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds: predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers and cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So, hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.” Caribbean diaspora stands behind Harris Meanwhile, support has poured in for Harris from the Caribbean diaspora and their political representatives. In a Caribbean Media Corporation (CMC) report last week several politicians in New York endorsed Harris whose father is the retired Jamaican-born economist Dr Donald Harris The Haitian-American chair of the Brooklyn Democratic Party, Rodneyse Bichotte Hermelyn, has welcomed Biden's decision to withdraw from the presidential elections in November and endorse Harris as the Democratic presidential candidate. “President Joe Biden has steadfastly served as an exemplary public servant for the betterment of our country for over five decades,” said Bichotte Hermelyn, the daughter of Haitian immigrants. The New York State Assembly member, who represents the 42nd Assembly District in Brooklyn, told CMC “as our president, Biden has greatly advanced our nation forward; achieving immense progress uplifting all Americans through his historic accomplishments and astute leadership”. She said the Brooklyn Democratic Party respects Biden’s “selfless decision” to drop out of the presidential election as the party focuses on defeating ex-President Donald J. Trump, and securing a Democratic-controlled US Congress and Senate. “The Brooklyn Democratic Party wholeheartedly echoes Biden’s endorsement of Harris as our next president, and we’re confident she’ll be an extraordinary partner to keep building on our strongest economy in decades, defending democracy, and improving our quality-of-life—from combating gun violence, to advancing women’s rights, to myriad more pressing issues facing Americans,” Bichotte Hermelyn said. “Vice President Kamala Harris is a fierce fighter with a proven progressive track record, deep experience in the Oval Office, and the determined drive to defeat Trump at the ballot box. As not only the first female, but also the first Black and first South Asian American VP, Harris will continue to break boundaries and build a better nation leading the White House. “As our first Party Chair who is a woman of colour, an elected official, and a Democratic Presidential Delegate, Kamala has my vote for a fairer and stronger future, as she continues to ensure the promises of our country for all people,” Bichotte Hermelyn said about Harris. Without indicating whether he will endorse Harris as the Democratic Party presidential nominee, Democratic party leader Hakeem Jeffries, whose eighth Congressional District in Brooklyn and Queens comprises a large concentration of Caribbean immigrants, lauded Biden as “one of the most accomplished and consequential leaders in American history. “In less than one term, he rescued the nation from a once-in-a-century pandemic, brought the economy roaring back from the brink of recession, enacted consequential legislation for everyday Americans and saved our democracy by defeating the Insurrectionist-in-Chief,” said Jeffries, the House of Representatives Minority Leader. “America is a better place today because President Joe Biden has led us with intellect, grace and dignity. We are forever grateful.” New York City Mayor Eric Adams, the second Black mayor after the late David N Dinkins to be mayor of the city, also said that America “owes a debt of gratitude to President Joe Biden for his decades of service. “He and his team took us out of covid, stabilised the country, and restored the soul of the nation. President Biden is now again delivering for the American people by passing the torch at a critical moment, when the country needs strong leadership from a new generation. “From here, the Democratic Party must continue to put working-people first and address their concerns about the cost of living, public safety, and our shared democratic values. I look forward to working with senior members of the party, as we make our push towards November, and ensure we address the concerns of New Yorkers and all Americans,” Adams said. Support for Harris has also poured in from the world of pop music. Support poured in from Janelle Monáe, John Legend, Katy Perry and Charli XCX, whose album “brat” inspired the Internet trend of “brat summer” and many Harris memes. (As a result, Harris’ campaign quickly set its X banner photo to the striking Shrek-green colour of Charli’s “brat” album cover.) On TikTok, users have remixed Harris’ speeches into songs by Taylor Swift, Chappell Roan, Carly Rae Jepsen and more. On July 26, former president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama announced in a video that they have endorsed Harris.

Trump was the keynote speaker at Bitcoin 2024 on Saturday, a gathering of industry heavyweights in Nashville, Tennessee. The Republican presidential candidate used the event to court voters and encourage campaign donations from the tech community. Cryptocurrency has emerged as a political battleground for Republicans, with Trump claiming the Democratic Party and Vice-President Kamala Harris were “against crypto”. The audience was at its most animated when Trump declared “on day one I will fire Gary Gensler”, the SEC chair nominated by current President Joe Biden. The crowd cheered loudly and started to chant “Trump” at this declaration. Mr Gensler led a crackdown on the crypto industry, and has previously said the sector is rife with “hucksters”. The SEC brought charges against the \"King of Crypto\" Sam Bankman-Fried, who was sentenced to 25 years for stealing billions of dollars from customers of his FTX cryptocurrency exchange. Speaking for about 45 minutes, Trump outlined some of his ideas for the sector if he were to win November's election. He said he would make the US the cryptocurrency capital of the world. His support for the industry is a 180 turn from his comments in 2021, when he told Fox Business he saw Bitcoin as a “scam” affecting the value of the US dollar. Trump told the crowd at the event he would keep 100% of Bitcoin that the US government currently holds or acquires, adding that it would be a “national Bitcoin stockpile”. The former president also said he would “immediately appoint a Bitcoin and crypto presidential advisory council”.

President Joe Biden’s quick endorsement of Harris after he withdrew from the race last week galvanized support behind Harris, even from potential challengers. Within 24 hours of the endorsement, Harris had raked in tens of millions in donations from hundreds of thousands of grassroots donors.

She’s now all but certain to be the nominee when the DNC holds its virtual roll call vote on Aug. 7. Harris has also set a deadline of Aug. 7 to name her running mate. Only a handful of people even flirted with putting their name in contention before Biden stepped down. There was West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, who spent a lot of time in front of cameras saying Biden should quit the race and calling for an open primary. When the rubber hit the road, however, he declined to make the run. He’s a former Democrat, but that didn’t stop him from preening for the cameras. Then there’s Minnesota Rep. Dean Phillips, who for some reason thinks people should know who he is and want him to be their leader. He ran for president this year, ending his campaign in March. Even after the organic, massive groundswell of support behind Harris, Phillips was still demanding a mini-primary for the nomination. Then there’s Marianne Williamson, the gadfly also-ran from 2020 who has jumped in and out of the 2024 race. After Biden’s announcement that she was stepping down, she posted a message on her campaign that the process for replacing him “must be opened to a genuinely democratic process at an open convention” and that she would seek the nomination, despite her most recent withdrawal from the race in June. However, in order to qualify, she needs to collect a minimum of 300 delegate signatures, with no more than 50 from one state. Given her performance, and lack of delegates, during the primaries earlier this year, that is extremely unlikely to happen.

He was talking about “the most important election ever,” which he said Republicans “must win,” before calling on attendees to cast ballots. “Christians, get out and vote, just this time,” Trump said. “You won’t have to do it anymore. Four more years, you know what? It’ll be fixed, it’ll be fine. You won’t have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians. I love you, Christians. I’m a Christian. I love you. Get out — you’ve got to get out and vote. In four years, you don’t have to vote anymore. We’ll have it fixed so good, you’re not going to have to vote” The clip has gone viral and sparked controversy in the hours since his speech. Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris’s campaign released a statement Saturday condemning what it called a promise “to end American democracy.” “When Vice President Harris says this election is about freedom she means it,” the statement reads. “Our democracy is under assault by criminal Donald Trump. After the last election Trump lost, he sent a mob to overturn the results. This campaign, he has promised violence if he loses, the end of our elections if he wins, and the termination of the Constitution to empower him to be a dictator to enact his dangerous Project 2025 agenda on America.” Since she became the favorite for the Democratic nomination, Harris has continued President Joe Biden’s line of attacks on Trump, including his alleged role in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, for which he has been indicted; his March comment that “it’s going to be a bloodbath for the country” if he does not get elected; and Project 2025, a blueprint for a conservative administration spearheaded by the Heritage Foundation. Trump spent plenty of time in his Friday speech attacking his new likely opponent, too. The former president called Harris “a bum,” slamming her for her “border czar” role as vice president at a time when immigration has become a top concern for voters, according to a Statista poll published July 5. Harris is poised to officially become the Democratic nominee at the Democratic National Convention, which is set to begin Aug. 19, about 2 1/2 months before the Nov. 5 general election. A Fox News poll released Friday shows the vice president and Trump within 1 percentage point of each other in the “blue wall” states of Wisconsin, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, all of which have voted for the winner of the last four presidential elections.","summary":"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump implored Christian conservatives gathered Friday night to vote in the November election, telling them that “in four years, you don’t have to vote anymore.” Trump made the remark toward the end of his hourlong speech at The Believers Summit, a three-day event hosted by Turning Point USA in West Palm [&#8230;]","url":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/campaigns/presidential/3101962/trump-you-wont-have-to-vote-anymore/","image":"https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Trump-West-Palm-Beach.webp","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 22:09:04","author":"Robert Stewart","authors":["Robert Stewart"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":252782716,"title":"Kamala Harris Says \"Underdog\" Campaign Will Overcome Trump's \"Wild Lies\"","text":"US Vice President Kamala Harris on Saturday acknowledged the uphill climb to defeating Donald Trump in November, but said her freshly-minted presidential campaign would prevail over the \"wild lies\" of her Republican rival.

She doesn't like Israel. That's the way it is,\" he said of the vice president, whose husband is Jewish. In perhaps his most outrageous statement of the night, he claimed Harris wanted to enshrine in federal law the right to \"rip the baby out of the womb in the eighth, ninth month and even after birth -- execute the baby after birth.\" Trump, who at age 78 is now the oldest major-party nominee in history, is scrambling to reorient an election against someone two decades his junior, having expected to face an 81-year-old incumbent Joe Biden beset by concerns over infirmity. Seeking to become the first female president in US history, Harris is tasked with rapidly assembling a campaign against an opponent who has been in near permanent reelection mode since he became president in 2016. Her late-starting White House bid has enjoyed early momentum. Polls that had shown Biden steadily slipping against Trump now show Harris in a race too close to call. She's garnered support from Democratic heavyweights, including Biden himself and most recently Barack and Michelle Obama.

Vance appeared on The Megyn Kelly Show on Friday to defend the anti-feline statement he made in 2021 – which has spawned massive backlash from cat lovers across the country. The Ohio senator claimed that women without kids don’t have a ‘direct stake’ in the future of America, saying they are ‘miserable at their own lives and their choices’. His comments provoked the ire of Aniston, 55, who said: ‘Mr. Vance, I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day. I hope she will not need to turn to IVF as a second option. Because you are trying to take that away from her, too.’ In response, Vance said: ‘That’s disgusting because my daughter is 2 years old.’ ‘And second of all, if she had fertility problems, as I said in that speech, I would try everything I could to try to help her because I believe families and babies are a good thing,’ he added. The resurrected footage saw Vance criticizing childless women such as Kamala Harris while speaking to Tucker Carlson on Fox News. In the clip, Vance slammed the prospect of turning the country over to childless women. He said: ‘I’m saying that we are effectively run in this country via the Democrats by a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and they choices they made so they want to make the rest of the country miserable too. ‘It’s just a basic fact. You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC, the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. ‘How does it make any sense that we have turned our country over to people that don’t have any stake in it?’ The Friends star wasn’t the only person upset by Vance’s remarks. Democratic women across the country immediately ran to Harris’ defense, even starting a ‘Cat Ladies for Kamala’ group. During his appearance on The Megyn Kelly show, he responded: ‘Obviously, it was a sarcastic comment. I’ve got nothing against cats, I’ve got nothing against dogs, I’ve got one dog at home, and I love him. ‘But look, people are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance of what I actually said.’ Vance claimed that both liberal and conservative women responded to the cat comments by saying they were ‘glad’ he pointed out there’s ‘something profoundly anti-family in our public policy.’ He tried to pin that on Democrats’ policies. ‘We have to ask ourselves, Why do we have masking of toddlers years after the pandemic ended?’ he mused. Vance also claimed that the Harris campaign came out against the extension of the child tax credit. ‘Why do we have the Harris campaign coming out this very morning and saying that we should not have the child tax credit which lowers tax rates for parents of young children?’ the VP hopeful said. That claim appears to be false. The Biden administration’s current position is that the White House is ‘committed to restoring the American Rescue Plan’s critical expansion of the Child Tax Credit to lift up all American families and children.’ Vance voted against the Democrat-led Right to IVF Act last month, though was supportive of a GOP-sponsored bill, the IVF Protection Act, which would strip states of Medicaid funding if they barred IVF treatments, though would allow for some restrictions. During his Q&A with Kelly, Vance explained that he was for IVF within reason. ‘I think we have to protect the rights of Christian hospitals to operate the way that they want to operate,’ he said. ‘But of course, that’s totally consistent with promoting fertility treatments for parents who need it.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nRepublican VP candidate JD Vance hit back at Jennifer Aniston after she slammed him over&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: JD Vance criticizes Jennifer Aniston for involving his two-year-old daughter in a dispute about &#8216;childless women.&#8217; first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/jd-vance-criticizes-jennifer-aniston-for-involving-his-two-year-old-daughter-in-a-dispute-about-childless-women/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/rewrite-this-title-JD-Vance-blasts-Jennifer-Aniston-for-dragging.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:55:36","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.309},{"id":252781244,"title":"Campaigners say Harris received $20,000 per minute during fundraising effort","text":"At one point on Thursday, the Kamala Harris campaign was raising $20,000 per minute, campaigners have said. The campaign for the vice president was hosting a Zoom call for white women to “answer the call” and “show up for Kamala Harris.” “We’re raising $20,000 per minute — the system wasn’t built for this. If you can’t make your donation, keep trying,” Shannon Watts, founder of the anti-gun violence group Mom Demands Action, wrote on X on Thursday morning. Watts added that there were more than 100,000 participants and that at least $2m was raised during the fundraising effort. The Harris campaign expected to bring in another $1.4m during a fundraiser in Pittsfield, Massachusetts on Saturday. The event, with about 800 attendees at the Colonial Theatre, was the largest event held in the Berkshires since then-First Lady Michelle Obama visited in 2012. Her remarks at the fundraiser lasted roughly 18 minutes. Describing her past as a prosecutor, she said: “In those roles, I took on perpetrators of all kinds. Predators who abused women, fraudsters who ripped off consumers, cheaters who broke the rules for their own gain. So hear me when I say, I know Donald Trump’s type.” The Harris campaign is targeting women voters, a group former President Donald Trump has struggled with in past elections. In 2016, Trump won 39 per cent of women, losing the group by 15 points to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In 2020, he garnered 44 per cent of the women’s vote, losing by 11 points to President Joe Biden, Newsweek noted. According to a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted between July 22 and 24, Harris leads Trump among women by 14 points – 55 to 41 per cent. This comes as Trump’s running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance is facing increasing scrutiny for his past comments about women. While Vance has been commended as an adept speaker and media performer for the Maga movement, Democrats think his conservative views on abortion and cutting rhetoric about women will push away swing voters, particularly with someone like Harris leading the charge against the Republicans. During an appearance on Fox News in July 2021, Vance criticized those he called “childless cat ladies” on the left with no “stake” in the future of the country. He pointed to Harris as being one of them despite her having two stepchildren. In a statement to Newsweek, spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk said: “Once again, the left-wing media have twisted Senator Vance’s words and spun up a false narrative about his position on the issues. The Democrats are in complete disarray with the most unpopular vice president in history as their party’s nominee.” She added: “The only childlessness we should be talking about is the childless parents who lost their kids to the murderous thugs and deadly fentanyl coming across Kamala’s southern border.”","summary":"Harris campaign targets women voters as Trump’s running mate is on the backfoot over past comments","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/kamala-harris-donations-2024-election-b2587021.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/07/27/17/AP24209567673554.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/0yrBdTDo-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:54:40","author":"Gustaf Kilander","authors":["Gustaf Kilander"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.112},{"id":252781404,"title":"Instead of endorsing Harris, some Democrats called for an open convention. When did we stop having them?","text":"After the 1972 McGovern-Fraser Commission paved the pathway for the country’s modern primary system, presidential nominees have been, more or less, decided before parties’ national conventions. This election cycle, the Democratic Party’s drama over its nominee has once again opened debate over whether conventions should go back to their roots and pick nominees, or if they should remain the decorative coronation events they’ve become over the past half-century. The journey to how modern voters pick presidential nominees has been long and raucous. In the earliest days of the republic, there was little need for a calculated nomination process. The Founding Fathers were already esteemed by the public and organically stepped into the presidency, so Hillsdale College politics professor Joseph Postell explained, “You really didn’t need to nominate those people. They were already distinguished on their own.” For over 50 years after America’s founding, the country generally used a caucus system. The early 1830s marked the first significant change in parties’ nomination processes. In 1831, the Anti-Mason Party held the first national party convention. Although a minor third party, the Anti-Masons’ new tactic caught the eye of the country’s major political players. Without familiar faces such as George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, the young country was ready for a nomination process that could recruit and introduce new and unfamiliar candidates to voters. In 1831, the National Republican Party held its own national convention, and the Democratic Party followed suit the next year. The convention strategy used delegates to pick a winning nominee from a pool of competing candidates. It was an uncertain, dynamic process that often led to multiple rounds of voting as competitors jostled to gain favor with delegates and party bosses. In 1844, James Polk won the Democratic nomination only after the ninth ballot. At the 1860 Republican convention, Abraham Lincoln was not the favored candidate heading into the event — it was only after the third round that he won his party’s favor. Twenty years later, James Garfield clinched the GOP nomination after 36 rounds of voting. Now called “open” or “brokered” conventions, delegates were not bound to any particular candidate headed into the event. Rather, they were free to vote for whichever candidate they favored. This political protocol for picking presidential nominees lasted well into the 20th century. The open convention strategy was not without criticism. As Theodore Roosevelt challenged William Taft for the Republican nomination in the early 20th century, he protested the delegate model as anti-democratic. The smoke-filled rooms with big party bosses swaying delegates behind the scenes were not to his liking. As a leader of the Progressive Era, Roosevelt believed direct primaries best captured “the voice of the people” as Postell said. “Roosevelt’s argument was, that [the convention model] is a betrayal of the people because the delegates often don’t speak for what the people actually want,” Postell said. A staunch populist, Roosevelt believed that “if you really want to have democracy, you need to have the primaries choose who the delegates are going to support at the convention,” according to the political science professor. “That way, you really collect the voice of the people.” Taft disagreed that direct primaries captured the heart of the republic. In 1913, he wrote a book called Popular Government, outlining why. Taft argued in his book that “delegates had a sense of responsibility to pick more moderate candidates who could win and who would appeal to a broader number of voters, and so he thought that was the point of the party, was to build a big tent and have lots of different voters who can support the party,” Postell said. While populists such as Roosevelt believed direct primaries allowed everybody to participate, Taft warned that in reality, the outcome would be far from democratic. As Postell put it, “Somebody like you or me, we could never actually run for office. … We’d have to get the backing of all these donors. We’d have to go out and make a lot of speeches.” Critics of the primary system warned it would be wealthy and connected people who bought and influenced their way into the nomination. Postell called it a “weird paradox.” “The more democratic you make your elections, the less democratic they actually become,” he said. The bitter rivalry between Roosevelt and Taft proved to be a watershed moment in politics. Roosevelt may have lost the nomination, but he won the primary “war,” as the significance of the system was ingrained in the country’s political consciousness. Unbound delegates and the open convention continued to exist until the 1970s, but after 1912, direct primaries began to play the dominant role in picking party nominees. 1968 proved to be the next pivotal point in the battle between open conventions and direct primaries. After then-Sen. Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated, multiple Democratic candidates hustled to clinch delegates at the convention. At the same time, violent protests put a pall over the event as Vietnam fervor hit a fever pitch. Although Vice President Hubert Humphrey, the establishment’s favored candidate, won after the first round, the atmosphere crackled with tension. By the end of the saga that capped off a decade of political violence, party leaders decided it was time to wrestle peace and order into conventions. Out of 1968 came the McGovern-Fraser Commission, which launched the primary system as America knows it today. In the years since the McGovern-Fraser Commission, both major political parties in the United States have adopted what are known as direct primaries. While historically, a victory in a primary was not a guarantee of the state’s delegates, in modern politics, that is no longer the case. The current nominating process in the U.S. mandates delegates be awarded based on results in primaries and caucuses. In an article published by Teaching American History, political science professor Jeremy D. Bailey praised the move, saying it “democratized the nomination process, taking it away from the control of party leaders.” However, after President Joe Biden dropped his reelection bid, some voiced support for taking the nomination process back to the open convention. From two dozen former House Democrats to Sen. Peter Welch (D-VT) and Washington Post columnist George Will, some voters hearkened to the old days, when delegates voters chose would select the best candidate. As Welch said in a statement to the Associated Press, “Having it be open would strengthen whoever is the ultimate nominee.” With Vice President Kamala Harris’s rapid ascension as Biden’s heir apparent, calls for an open convention have fallen on deaf ears. While the modern primary system may have eliminated the old party-boss system and the deals that happened behind closed doors, Hillsdale history professor Paul Moreno said the breakdown of contested conventions only introduced a “different group of sort of power brokers in both parties.” Other experts such as Jed Ober, the senior director of programs at Democracy International, disagree. CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER “It strips elites of a key patronage tool and a great deal of influence in determining the intellectual trajectory of their party and — if they are successful — their country,” Ober wrote in 2015. “In the long run, though, it strengthens the foundations and competitiveness of the party by expanding its constituent base to a more representative group of citizens,” Ober added.","summary":"After the 1972 McGovern-Fraser Commission paved the pathway for the country’s modern primary system, presidential nominees have been, more or less, decided before parties’ national conventions.

Try it yourselves, folks. See you in a bit,\" he wrote on June 27. The president's post accompanied two photos of him holding a can of water featuring his face with red eyes on it, with the can's text reading, \"Get Real, Jack. It's just water.\"Newsweek has reached out to Biden's former campaign press team for comment via email on Sunday.A month since his joke, the entire political landscape has changed.The Debate On June 27, Biden and Trump faced off for the first presidential debate of the 2024 election cycle, although the politicians have previously debated during the 2020 election. The debate, hosted by CNN without a live audience, took place in Atlanta.Biden's performance was widely regarded as low-energy and unconvincing. He faced criticism from his own party, with many Democratic voters, politicians, and commentators immediately pointing to his stumbling and sometimes incoherent and hard-to-hear responses as worrisome.Questions about Biden's mental sharpness and age flared up during and immediately after the debate, following the 81-year-old's weak performance. Trump, 78, has also faced criticism for his age and mental acuity.A Biden aide, meanwhile, told Newsweek late that night that the president was battling a cold during the debate.The Aftermath Since the debate, over 30 Democratic Congress members called for Biden to step aside, urging the Democrats to put forward a new candidate at the top of the ticket.Pressure from top party leaders like former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi began to mount, with Pelosi responding to calls about whether she wanted Biden in the race on MSNBC's Morning Joe two weeks after the debate: \"I want him to do whatever he decides to do. And that's the way it is. Whatever he decides, we go with.\"In mid-July, according to a Washington Post report, former President Barack Obama, who selected Biden as his running mate, confided in his allies that he is concerned about the viability of Biden's reelection campaign.Donors and public backers of Biden's campaign, like actor George Clooney who calls himself a \"lifelong Democrat\" and a Biden admirer, also faltered on their support for Biden over concerns of his ability to win the election and serve four more years.Clooney wrote a New York Times op-ed titled, \"I Love Joe Biden. But We Need a New Nominee,\" where he wrote, \"We are not going to win in November with this president. On top of that, we won't win the House, and we're going to lose the Senate. This isn't only my opinion; this is the opinion of every senator and congress member and governor that I've spoken with in private. Every single one, irrespective of what he or she is saying publicly.\"On the other hand, there have been growing calls among Republicans to invoke the 25th Amendment and remove the president from office. The amendment would deem Biden \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office,\" and thus, Vice President Kamala Harris would oversee the nation from its highest office.In the days following the debate, as concerns about his age and mental acuity were at a peak, Biden accidentally called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky \"Putin\" during a speech about the United States supporting Ukraine in its ongoing war against Russia. In a speech later that day, he mistakenly called Harris, \"Vice President Trump.\" The double gaffe further fueled calls questioning his capability to run the country for another term.Biden also began to slip in the presidential polls against Trump. His approval rating also fell, with the national poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight showing 55.6 percent of Americans disapproved of Biden, while 38.8 percent approved, as of July 26.Dropping OutDespite repeatedly reaffirming his commitment to staying in the presidential race, on Sunday, July 21, Biden announced his exit from the race, seemingly heeding calls from within the Democratic Party. Moments later, he publicly endorsed Harris for president.His announcement came just over 100 days before Election Day, which is on November 5, and less than 30 days before the Democratic National Convention (DNC) begins in Chicago on August 19.In a national address Wednesday night, Biden said that he dropped out of the race to \"pass the torch to a new generation,\" regardless of his own \"personal ambition\" to win and serve out a second term. The president said that the likely election between Harris and Trump would be a choice \"between moving forward or backward.\"Biden said he will continue to serve out his term, which ends on January 20, 2025.\"Over the next six months I'll be focused on doing my job as president,\" he said, echoing his platform policies like \"lowering costs for hardworking families,\" \"defending personal freedoms,\" and \"calling out hate and extremism.\"In the past week, Harris has rallied former Biden supporters to donate and back her campaign for the Oval Office.","summary":"One month to the day after preparing to face off with Donald Trump in the first presidential debate of 2024, President Joe Biden has exited the race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/biden-began-history-making-month-debate-joke-he-probably-regrets-1931125","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2437830/presidential-debate-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:47:39","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.079},{"id":252781316,"title":"Trump calls Kamala Harris' meeting with Netanyahu 'terrible and insulting'","text":"Former President Trump called Vice President Kamala Harris' meeting with the Israeli prime minister \"terrible and insulting\" Saturday, claiming the White House disrespected the Middle East ally.

Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, who died this month after a battle with cancer, according to an official who shared the details first with NBC News. The official from Harris’ office said Harris and Jackson Lee were dear friends who bonded over their work as elected officials and as members of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the nation’s first historically Black sorority. As a result, Harris wanted to attend the services despite having a packed schedule now that she is the front-runner to become the Democratic nominee. “She wanted to make sure that she was there to pay her respects,” the official said of Harris. The official also said Harris connected with Jackson Lee on shared legislative goals both while Harris served in the Senate and when she became vice president, including reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, ensuring clean water and removing lead pipes from communities, allocating funding for historically Black colleges and universities, and focusing on disparities related to maternal health, especially as it relates to Black women. The official also said the two worked together on making Juneteenth a federal holiday and on efforts to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, a police reform bill that has been stalled. In statement released at the time of Jackson Lee’s death, Harris described Jackson Lee as a “tenacious advocate for justice and a tireless fighter for the people of Houston and the people of America” who “distinguished herself as a dedicated advocate for her community, an effective legislator, and a fiercely loyal colleague and friend.” She also said Jackson Lee was “first and foremost, a leader dedicated to serving the people of her beloved city” of Houston and “a champion for women’s rights.” “As a judge in Houston, a member of the Houston City Council, and a member of the United States Congress, Sheila Jackson Lee’s work improved the lives of millions of Americans,” Harris said in the statement. “She saw what could be — a nation that is more equal, more fair, and more free — and she dedicated her life to realizing that vision.” Harris also recalled working alongside Jackson Lee on legislation when they were serving in Congress together and members of the Congressional Black Caucus. “To work alongside the Congresswoman was to marvel at her mastery of the legislative process,” Harris said in the statement. “She was relentless — one of our nation’s fiercest, smartest, and most strategic leaders in the way she thought about how to make progress happen. There was never a trite or trivial conversation with the Congresswoman. She was always fighting for the people of Houston and the people of America.” Thursday’s trip will be Harris’ third visit to Texas in the last month and her second as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Harris was also in Dallas earlier this month to speak at a convention for Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc. And last week, she spoke at a convention in Houston for the American Federation of Teachers, a large teachers union.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nVice President Kamala Harris will fly to Houston on Thursday to attend&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Harris Honors Late Friend and Sorority Sister Rep.

The presumed Democratic nominee since President Joe Biden's recent withdrawal has undergone a \"thorough\" vetting process for her own vice president, her campaign told CBS News. \"The vice president has begun a process that is probably one of the most important processes and decisions that she will make during her time as a candidate for president,\" said campaign manager Julie Chávez Rodríguez. \"As a campaign, we'll get ready to gear up to have an extremely strong ticket in the coming weeks.\" The top names being floated include Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Arizona Sen. Mark Kelly, Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear and North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. \"The conventional wisdom is that you get someone that might help you regionally,\" Democratic strategist Basil Smikle told the Hill, noting Pennsylvania's proximity to battleground states Michigan and Wisconsin. Harris also on Saturday traveled to Pittsfield, Mass., for her first presidential campaign fundraiser, raising $1.8 million, according to her campaign. The vice president at the event acknowledged the momentum her campaign has picked up since Biden passed the torch. \"The day after I announced my campaign, we saw the best 24 hours of grassroots fundraising in presidential campaign history,\" she said. Shapiro and Kelly have been on Harris' VP shortlist because of the weight their states carry on the electoral map, with Arizona holding 11 electoral votes and Pennsylvania having 19. Kelly, a former NASA astronaut and Navy pilot, boasts an impressive resume, but he also represents a key swing state for Democrats. Biden won Arizona in 2020 but was projected to lose to Trump before he dropped out. Some Democrats think Cooper would be Harris' top pick for running mate, citing his winning political track record and North Carolina's 16 electoral votes. \"I just think that Cooper is a complete package,\" said state Senate Democratic Leader Dan Blue. \"I don't see any vulnerabilities -- unless being a Southerner and talking a little slower might be a vulnerability in certain parts of the country.\" Cooper is nearing the end of his second term as governor, and term limits prevent him from running again, freeing him up for a White House run. Harris has precious little time to announce her pick, as the Democratic National Committee said they would like a decision by Aug. 7. The virtual nomination could be as soon as Aug. 1 and no later than Aug. 7.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris is racing to choose a running mate before the Democratic National Convention in August.","url":"https://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2024/07/27/kamala-harris-running-mate-pick/8551722114045/","image":"https://cdnph.upi.com/ph/st/th/8551722114045/2024/upi/0a691fb14819135155445b4fc209dd07/v1.2/Kamala-Harris-narrows-VP-picks-with-weeks-left-to-choose.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:37:24","author":"Ehren Wynder","authors":["Ehren Wynder"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":252780470,"title":"Kamala Harris Makes Surprise Comic-Con Appearance ","text":"Taegan Goddard is the founder of Political Wire, one of the earliest and most influential political web sites.

The British singer-songwriter has inspired a messy, volatile party-girl aesthetic following the release of her album Brat — which this week even ended up influencing US politics. Barbie and pink are so last year. Instead, brats party into the early hours, have a faint smell of cigarettes, wear what they want and speak their own mind. She said: “It’s like this girl who goes to a rave and she is wearing a tank top. “You can kind of see her nipples through it and she is sweaty but she is hot and she is dancing with her friends. “I was just piecing this all together and that allowed me to go and write more songs under this guise of, I know what this girl wants and that girl is me.” But while Charli — real name Charlotte Emma Aitchison — has become the It Girl of the summer, the Cambridge-born pop star revealed that she has not always been quite so cool. She said: “I was making music when I was 14. I was so lame. The culture of cool, aesthetic references and being well read, actually, is happening younger and younger and younger. “Most 12-year-olds are cool right now or have an awareness of, ‘my life on the internet.’ Like, ‘I need to present in a certain way and I need to have certain interests and understand certain things and know what is socially, politically, culturally correct, incorrect and what is aesthetically pleasing.” Charli, who turns 32 next month, added: “It is not like when I was 12. Maybe I was just super-unaware and not very smart or cool, but those things weren’t crossing my mind — I was just in my space.” But brats are not just here to party — they now could win the US election for Vice President Kamala Harris. Following the news that Joe Biden dropped out of the US presidential election last week to be replaced by his VP, Charli wrote on X: “Kamala IS brat.” Harris’s campaign on X and TikTok has since been rebranded as Kamala HQ, in the same font and lime green colour as Charli’s album cover, in a bid to target Gen-Z voters. Alongside Charli, pop stars including Chappell Roan, Sabrina Carpenter and Cmat are embracing their inner brat. They aren’t at all afraid to wear their hearts on their sleeves, like Sabrina on her single Please Please Please — the current UK No1 — in which she begs boyfriend Barry Keoghan not to mess up their relationship. And US singer Chappell has endorsed Charli by posing with the Brat album on Instagram. Thanking her team for the success of Brat, Charli wrote: “Even when I’m being an absolute nightmare, you still stand by me and make me feel comfortable to be myself. “And at the end of the day, that’s exactly what Brat is all about: Me, my flaws, my f**k-ups, my ego all rolled into one.” If being unapologetically yourself is what makes- a brat, I am fully behind it.

Then I went in with this idea and spoke for two hours about everything I want to write about and they were like, ‘OK, let’s go.’” “It will be a vulnerable side to Caity Baser, and chill vibes.” I can’t wait to hear it.

Zac's keen to score Vardy role HE’S the eternal Hollywood hunk but I can reveal Zac Efron now has his sights set on playing an English lad instead – footballer Jamie Vardy. The actor is a huge fan of the beautiful game, even flying to Berlin to watch the Euros and now wants to star in the upcoming movie about Leicester City striker Jamie. An insider tells me: “Zack loves footie, or soccer as they say in the States, and is obsessed with the idea of Jamie’s rag-to-riches tale. “He’s told pals he is really keen to play the football ace in the biopic about Jamie.” The news comes after Tinseltown stepped up plans for the flick.

Kevin Munoz, a spokesperson for the Harris campaign, said she “directed her team to begin the process of vetting potential running mates” but declined to elaborate on the search. Harris is expected to make a selection by Aug. 7, in order to align with the party’s plan to virtually nominate a ticket by that date. Picking a vice presidential candidate will cement the Democratic standard-bearers to take on Republican nominee Donald Trump and running mate JD Vance in the November election. Harris’ sidekick can serve as a force multiplier who can campaign and raise money on her behalf, while ideally complimenting her strengths and covering any vulnerabilities. Most on Harris’ list are White, male politicians with centrist leanings who could help Harris appeal to swing-state voters, as well as business leaders and donors. They have a track record of attacking Trump and his firebrand style of politics. Walz has gained momentum with progressives, enough to vault himself into consideration, according to people familiar with the matter. Allies of Harris say chemistry between the vice president and whoever she picks is just as important as their political attributes. Harris knows firsthand the pressures of being No. 2 on the Democratic ticket and is weighing her experience as she makes a selection, according to her supporters. Harris’ ascension to become the likely Democratic nominee, after President Joe Biden’s stunning exit from the race, has accelerated what is typically a months-long vetting process of potential running mates. The pick will take place amid a furious effort by Harris to shape the Biden campaign operation in her image, define herself to voters and expand her war chest — all with roughly 100 days until Election Day. Democrats cautioned that the search must still be thorough in order to catch any red-flags. Those warnings took on new urgency as old clips emerged of Vance making disparaging comments about childless women, which have come under widespread criticism. “As the Trump team is finding out, it’s not just the legal vetting that the team has to do, but it also has to go through tweets, speeches and clips,” said Democratic strategist Karen Finney. “You want a thorough vet, and you want to go through a substantial volume of background info to give you a picture of the person.” Former Attorney General Eric Holder is leading the vetting process. Holder’s law firm, Covington & Burling LLP, has 12 to 15 files on candidates, according to one person familiar with the process, showing Harris initially cast a wide net. Shapiro is a popular governor of arguably the most important swing state, and a skilled orator who has performed strongly in rural areas, a weakness for Democrats. Walz, a former teacher and Army National Guard member, could dash Trump’s hopes of making Minnesota competitive and mirror Vance’s Midwestern appeal. Kelly’s state doubles as a battleground and border area and he has broken with Biden on immigration issues. His wife, Gabrielle Giffords, is a former congresswoman who became a gun-control activist after surviving an assassination attempt in 2011. Harris is also looking at the Biden Cabinet for options. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg are being vetted, the people said. A Harris campaign official said she is evaluating potential picks based on shared political values, including on the economy and democracy, and their ability to act as a governing partner and lead the country, if necessary. The switch from Biden to Harris has energized Democrats, who have gathered tens of thousands on organizing calls and given millions of dollars in donations since the president dropped out. The challenge for Harris is to sustain that momentum for their pick. Harris’ surrogates are fanning out to battlegrounds, including some possible running mates. This weekend, Shapiro and Walz are campaigning in their home states. Buttigieg is embarking on a tour of three ports that will take him to battlegrounds Michigan and Wisconsin. Those said to be under consideration by Harris have publicly said little about the selection process — though few have denied having interest in the job. Reporters at a Monday event on environmental grants peppered Shapiro with questions on about whether he would be picked, prompting him to respond, “are we not talking about concrete anymore?” Kelly told reporters Thursday outside the US Capitol that the selection process is not about him, “but I’ve always, always when I’ve had the chance to serve, I think that’s very important to do.” Democrats in Washington are playing a parlor game about whom they think would be best at Harris’ side. “I know the conventional wisdom is that she needs to pick a White man. I don’t disagree that having that kind of gender balance is good, but if you wanted to swing for the fences, you could do a Harris-Whitmer ticket that would excite a lot of people,” said former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle said, referring to Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who has said she wouldn’t accept if asked. Daschle added that Kelly and Shapiro would also “provide a fantastic contrast” with Vance. By late in the week, the halls of Congress were buzzing with excitement over who Harris would select. Senator Laphonza Butler, a close Harris ally, called Kelly smart and said he got into public service “for all the right reasons.” Harris’ choice, she said, “is going to come down to what is her relationship, what kind of familiarity and loyalty she feels with whoever she picks.”","summary":"Harris is expected to make a selection by Aug. 7, in order to align with the party’s plan to virtually nominate a ticket by that date. ","url":"https://fortune.com/2024/07/27/kamala-harris-short-list-running-mates-mark-kelly-josh-shapiro-tim-walz/","image":"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/GettyImages-2163690934-e1722114886584.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:24:56","author":"Bloomberg,Jenny Leonard,Josh Wingrove,Nancy Cook","authors":["Bloomberg","Jenny Leonard","Josh Wingrove","Nancy Cook"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.027},{"id":252780342,"title":"Insider insight: Pete Buttigieg shares what Kamala Harris is truly like in private, and the campaign strategy she needs to adjust compared to Biden","text":"Transportation Secretary and VP hopeful, Pete Buttigieg, said the public is yet to learn the full extent of Kamala Harris’ humor and tenacity – traits he said she has shown much more of in private. Buttigieg, 42, told The New York Times in a wide-ranging sit-down interview, ‘I think people do know this, but she is not just impressive, she’s smart and funny.’ ‘I actually think what’s interesting, not just TV, but the internet has picked up on the fact that she has this great sense of humor. And it’s also revealing that the GOP has tried to attack her for it, and that’s fallen flat.’ And while he at first avoided a question about how the current vice president should differentiate herself from Biden, Buttigieg stressed that Harris should ‘explain how she’s contributed to the work that brought inflation back down to three percent in this country.’ He added the Democratic nominee must highlight the ‘difference between her economic proposals and the clearly inflationary proposals of Donald Trump.’ ‘I’d like to see her reach those concerns that Americans have,’ he said. Bernie Sanders issued a similar statement earlier this week, telling the Boston Globe: ‘[Harris] needs to have an agenda that speaks to the crisis facing working families all over this country. ‘I think the Democrats are going to have to be very, very clear as to what ideas they have in the midst of massive income and wealth inequality.’ In his latest interview, Buttigieg recalled a time he really got to see Harris ‘in action’ instead of her usually funny self when he had to mock debate her while playing the role of a Mike Pence – an experience he called ‘a very strange psychological thing.’ ‘So often you hear: “Oh, this person’s really funny and loose,” but it doesn’t come through on TV,’ he said. ‘I think she’s a very convincing leader.’ However, Buttigieg still defended President Joe Biden, despite his disastrous and concerning debate performance earlier in June, saying he’s ‘really good at being president and in my view still is.’ As for why he thinks the Democratic party hasn’t put more effort into finding new nominee options – such as Gavin Newsom and Gretchen Whitmer, who were early names thrown into the ring after Biden quit his campaign – Buttigieg said it was easiest to look toward Harris. ‘I think a lot of people looked at her, looked at what she brought, looked at the importance of quickly bringing the party together and reached that conclusion that backing her was the best way to do that,’ he told The Times. He also thinks the Trump fever will die down – and called Vance’s ‘childless cat lady’ comments and the former president labeling Harris a ‘thug’ a ‘bad look for Republicans.’ ‘The fact that they can’t think of what else to do besides go right to race and gender isn’t just revealing about some of the ugliest undercurrents in today’s Republican Party, it’s also just profoundly unimaginative, because it means that they can’t speak to how any of this is going to make people’s lives better. ‘In other words, they can’t conceive of a politics that isn’t just about the personalities.’ Meanwhile, Harris has pulled ahead of Trump in a new national poll taken two days after Biden endorsed her. The Reuters/Ipsos poll shows Harris leading Trump by 2 percent in a head-to-head general election matchup as she hits the campaign in place of the ailing 81-year-old Biden. Buttigieg also spoke with HBO’s Bill Maher last week about the attempted assassination of Trump and the role Secret Service director Kimberly Cheatle, who has since stepped down, played. ‘I believe that President Biden and the administration will do the right thing,’ he said, prior to Cheatle stepping down as the nation called for her resignation. In his interview with The Times, Buttigieg also commented on Harris’ campaign strategy of diverting from the previous Democratic straight-laced attacks on Trump that he’s bad for democracy and leaning into calling him ‘weird.’ ‘I think we’re doing both,’ he said. ‘We’re talking about the implications for democracy and noting that he is obviously a strange person who’s getting stranger, and you’ve got to ask yourself, is that the kind of person you want in charge of the country?’ As for whether or not Buttigieg will be on Harris’ VP ticket – or even if he wants it – he remained mum. ‘I don’t think it’s appropriate for me to talk like that knowing that the person who needs to make that decision is the person who’s going to make it, and that’s her. Not me,’ he said.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nTransportation Secretary and VP hopeful, Pete Buttigieg, said the public is yet&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Insider insight: Pete Buttigieg shares what Kamala Harris is truly like in private, and the campaign strategy she needs to adjust compared to Biden first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/insider-insight-pete-buttigieg-shares-what-kamala-harris-is-truly-like-in-private-and-the-campaign-strategy-she-needs-to-adjust-compared-to-biden/","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/07/27/20/87846511-13679485-Buttigieg_42_sat_down_with_The_New_York_Times_to_discuss_his_fel-a-5_1722109604078.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-07-27 21:21:58","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.182},{"id":252782412,"title":"Sen.

Harris traveled to Pittsfield, Massachusetts, on Saturday where she was expected to raise more than $1.4 million, her campaign announced, from an expected audience of about 800 people at the Colonial Theatre. That would be $1 million-plus more than the original goal set for the event before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race. She told an excited group of supporters that she entered the race as an “underdog,” while expressing confidence that her surging campaign could defeat Trump. “I will fight to move our nation forward,” Harris said. “Donald Trump intends to take our country backwards.” Harris also poked at Trump, and his running mate Sen. JD Vance, for lobbing peculiar attacks at her and other Democrats. The vice president appeared to be alluding to a 2021 interview with Vance in which he slammed some Democratic lawmakers without biological children, including Harris, as “childless cat ladies” with “no direct stake” in America. “You may have noticed Donald Trump has been resorting to some wild lies about my record and some of what he and his running mate are saying, it is just plain weird,” Harris said. “I mean that's the box you put that in, right?” Supporters for the fundraiser at the Colonia Theater included musician James Taylor and many of the state's Democratic heavyweights, including Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, former Gov. Deval Patrick and Rep. Richie Neal. Harris took in more than $100 million in donations in the first 48 hours after Biden quit the race, a presidential record, and aides said she has continued to raise money at a steady clip. “This is a people-powered campaign,” Harris said. “And we have momentum.” Harris, a former prosecutor in her home state of California, also derided Trump for his legal troubles. She noted his recent conviction on 34 counts of fraud in New York, a jury finding the former president of being liable for sexual abusing advice columnist E. Jean Carroll in 1996, and a $25 million settlement paid to attendees of the now-defunct real estate seminar called Trump University. “I've been dealing with people like him my entire career,” Harris said. She added, “So in this campaign, and I say in all seriousness, I will proudly put my record against his any day.” Harris began her remarks with praise for Biden, who opted to end his reelection bid and endorse Harris last weekend after his campaign fell into a tailspin following his disastrous June 27 debate performance against Trump. She called Biden’s legacy of accomplishment over the past three and a half years “unmatched in modern history.” Trump at a campaign event in Florida on Friday called Harris the worst vice president in U.S. history. He said that if elected she would be a poor steward of the economy and would govern as a “radical liberal” who would fill the federal court systems with “far-left judges” and “impose crazy San Francisco liberal values on Americans nationwide.” The vice president told supporters that her economic agenda would sharply contrast with Trump's, who she claimed is squarely focused on lowering tax rates for wealthy Americans and improving the bottom lines of corporations. “Building up the middle class will be the defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said. She added, “Let us make no mistake, this campaign is not just about us versus Donald Trump. Our campaign has always been about two very different visions for our nation.” © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Blinken and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi met for roughly an hour and 20 minutes on the sidelines of an annual Southeast Asian regional security forum in Vientiane, Laos, at which tensions between China and U.S. ally Philippines over disputes in the South China Sea were a prime focus of discussion. U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Blinken and Wang had had “an open and productive” discussion but had not reached any significant agreements on the issues that divide them most in the Indo-Pacific, Europe and the Americas. “The United States will continue to take necessary actions to safeguard our interests and values, and those of our allies and partners, including on human rights,” Blinken told Wang, according to Miller. Blinken “made clear that the United States, together with our allies and partners, will advance our vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific,” he said, highlighting recently aggressive Chinese actions toward Taiwan, the self-governing island that Beijing claims as part of the mainland and has vowed to reunify by force if necessary. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement that despite regular contacts, “the U.S. has not stopped its containment and suppression of China and has even further intensified it.” The statement said the risks to China-U.S. ties “are still accumulating and the challenges are also rising” and that \"it is necessary to constantly calibrate the direction, manage risks, properly handle differences, eliminate disturbance and promote cooperation.” Blinken scolded China for “destabilizing actions in the South China Sea” and “affirmed the United States’ support for freedom of navigation and overflight and the peaceful resolution of disputes, consistent with international law,” Miller said. America's top diplomat did praise China and the Philippines for concluding an agreement earlier this week that allowed the Philippines on Saturday to make a supply trip to the disputed area without having to confront Beijing’s forces, the first such trip since the deal was concluded. “We are pleased to take note of the successful resupply today at the Second Thomas Shoal,\" Blinken told Association of Southeast Asian Nations foreign ministers before his meeting with Wang. \"We applaud that and hope and expect to see that it continues going forward.” Prior to the deal, tensions between the Philippines and China escalated for months, with China’s coast guard and other forces using powerful water cannons and dangerous blocking maneuvers to prevent food and other supplies from reaching Filipino navy personnel. Still, Blinken, who will be in Manila next week as part of his current six-country tour of Asia, also deplored China’s “escalatory and unlawful actions taken against the Philippines in the South China Sea over the last few months.” In his meeting with Wang, Blinken also re-raised deep U.S. and European concerns about China's support of Russia's defense industrial sector that Washington and capitals in Europe believe Russia is using to ramp up the production of weapons for use in its war against Ukraine. Blinken “made clear that if (China) does not act to address this threat to European security, the United States will continue to take appropriate measures to do so,” Miller said. Since that warning was first issued more than a year ago, the U.S. and others have imposed sanctions on more than 300 Russian and Chinese firms engaged in the trade. Asked whether the Chinese had responded to those sanctions in the way the U.S. and its allies would like, a senior State Department official said \"not enough that our concerns have been put to rest.” The official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity to discuss the private diplomatic meeting. Blinken's Asia trip was announced just hours after President Joe Biden said he would step down as a candidate in November's election in favor of Vice President Kamala Harris. Although the senior official said that decision had not come up in Saturday's meetings, he said Blinken had pointed out to Wang that Harris had experience with China and had met Chinese President Xi Jinping in Bangkok in 2022. Also present at the ASEAN meeting in Laos was Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, but the senior official said Blinken had no interactions with him. From Laos, Blinken flew to Hanoi for a brief stop to offer condolences for the passing last week of Vietnam's powerful Communist Party chief and was to travel on to Japan, the Philippines, Singapore and Mongolia. In Tokyo and Manila on Sunday and Monday, Blinken will be joined by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin where they will meet with their Japanese and Filipino counterparts to shore up defense cooperation. Blinken will also meet in Tokyo with the Indian and South Korean foreign ministers. For the past six decades, there have been large U.S. troop deployments in Japan and South Korea and a mutual defense treaty with the Philippines has been a constant of American policy in Asia. Former President Donald Trump, now the Republican candidate for president, cast doubt on the usefulness of U.S. alliances around the world during his first term in office and suggested that the American military presence in Japan and South Korea could be reduced or eliminated.

Ehrhart Over the course of the previous two weeks, I have been working on an essay I had titled “There Is Still Time—But Not Much,” in which I argued that President Joe Biden should step aside and withdraw from this November’s election if the Democrats want even the slightest chance of defeating former President Donald Trump. Given that Biden officially withdrew his candidacy this past Sunday, and has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris for the top spot on the ticket, there seems little point in reiterating my arguments in any detail. Suffice it to say that Biden is a decent enough person with a moral compass—in glaring contrast to his predecessor—and has actually done a far better job as president than his predecessor ever did. But he is suffering the ravages and infirmities of old age, and his decision to withdraw is the right decision. There is also little point in arguing what Biden should have done four years ago or six months ago or three months ago, let alone what the—forgive me, folks—stupid Democratic Party should have done in 1994 or 2000 or 2016. All that matters is what the Democratic Party does now with the opportunity Biden’s withdrawal offers them. Biden has endorsed Harris for the nomination. Until very recently, I did not consider her a viable replacement for Biden, even if Biden did withdraw. I kept remembering that she polled so badly as a presidential candidate in 2020 that she withdrew her candidacy before 2020 actually arrived. But in the past month, three different people—none of whom know each other, and all of whom I respect—have offered opinions of Harris that do not match my own, arguing with some knowledge that Harris’s 2019 campaign was badly managed, that the Biden camp has largely kept Harris out of the spotlight during his presidency, and that she is in fact very smart and very capable. Moreover, though I am skeptical of polls and pollsters, several of the people who have caused me to re-think Harris argue that Harris is polling better than Biden with African Americans and younger voters. Both groups helped Biden win in 2020, but are clearly far less keen on him this time around. The real question is: will the Democratic Party screw up this opportunity the way the party did by cheating Bernie Sanders out of the 2016 presidential nomination, by allowing the Republicans to claim the White House in 2000 by the vote of a single Supreme Court Justice, or by allowing Bill Clinton to turn the Democratic Party in to Republican Lite in the wake of the 1994 bi-elections? Will the stupid Democratic Party just for once stop being stupid? The party’s convention is still almost a month away. Preferably before the convention, pick a running mate for Harris, or at least float a few solid possibilities: Gavin Newsom of California, Josh Shapiro of Pennsylvania, Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan, Roy Cooper of North Carolina. Plan and run a vigorous convention that emphasizes the youthfulness and vitality of the ticket. And then take off the gloves and campaign like you’ve never campaigned before. Relentlessly. I might even say ruthlessly. Like a hungry lion that hasn’t eaten in days and has just spotted an old wildebeest. An old wildebeest is not a bad analogy, in fact, because with Biden no longer in the race, the Trumpsters have just lost their strongest argument. The Democrats have the opportunity to turn the question of age back on the Retrumplicans. Prior to Joe Biden, the oldest president in U.S. history was Ronald Reagan, who was 78 by the time he left office. Trump is already 78. The Democrats must also hammer away at Trump’s constant lying. The man is incapable of telling the truth. Campaign ads need to focus on the most egregious—and readily provable—lies, and get those in front of the American electorate over and over again. Trump has always relied on “the Big Lie.” Democrats must rely on “the Big Truth.” It may already be too late to prevent the re-election of a convicted felon who brags about grabbing women by their pussies, screws porn stars while his third wife is nursing their new baby, cheats repeatedly and massively on his taxes, refuses to pay workers he has hired, urges his followers to “fight like hell” to prevent the peaceful transfer of presidential power, promises to be a dictator if he’s re-elected, promises a “bloodbath” if he is not re-elected, and is utterly incapable of opening his mouth without lying. But with Biden’s withdrawal, there is now at least a chance of avoiding the return of the worst president in U.S. history. It will require, however, that the Democratic Party get its head out of its collective backside and get to work. –=≈=– W. D.
