Email tips@dailymail.com By Brian Marks For Dailymail.com Published:00:56 BST, 8 August 2024 |Updated:01:36 BST, 8 August 2024 e-mail 6 shares 1 View comments Angelina Jolie was reportedly 'shocked and worried' after learning that her son Pax had crashed his e-bike in Los Angeles. The 20-year-old — whom Angelina shares with her ex-husband Brad Pitt — is 'still recovering' in the wake of the devastating crash, a source told People on Wednesday. They added that he was currently 'uncomfortable' and would 'need further treatments' down the line. The update comes just days after Pax was released from the ICU, when a source previously said he would face a 'long road of recovery.' Angelina's son crashed his e-bike into the back of a stopped car at an intersection on the crowded Los Feliz Boulevard on July 30. Angelina Jolie was reportedly 'shocked and worried' after learning that her son Pax had crashed his e-bike in Los Angeles, a source told People on Wednesday; pictured June 16 in NYC The 20-year-old — whom Angelina shares with her ex-husband Brad Pitt — is 'still recovering' in the wake of the devastating crash. They added that he was currently 'uncomfortable' and would 'need further treatments'; seen in LA on July 11 Complicated the matter was the fact that Pax appears to have hit his head when he collided with the car, and he was not wearing a helmet at the time. The source added that he was 'very lucky' to not have more significant injuries. 'It could have been much worse since he didn't wear a helmet,' they said. Although the crash was devastating for his mother Angelina to hear about, she and his sibling had come together to support him in the aftermath. 'Angie was shocked and worried when she got the call about the accident,' the source said, adding that her five other children — Maddox, 22; Zahara, 19; Shiloh, 18; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 16 — 'are supporting Pax as best as they can.' A source previously told People that Angelina's son had 'suffered complex trauma' from the crash, and he will reportedly require physical therapy to aid his recovery. Pax's medical emergency happened amid his ongoing estrangement from his father Brad Pitt. An insider exclusively told DailyMail.com on Tuesday that Brad has been distressed over getting 'radio silence' from his family regarding Pax's condition. 'Don't expect Pax's accident to bring the family dynamic back in any way as Pax is 100 percent on Angie's side and doesn't want any well wishes or remorse from Brad,' the source continued. Although Brad was 'upset' that his son was injured and hoped to 'help out in any way possible,' the insider said that prospect 'doesn't seem to be something that will ever happen since there is a forever disconnect and divide between them all.' 'It is gutting Brad that it has got to this point that he can't even be a worried dad, as all he is getting is radio silence from finding out exactly what is going down with his son,' they added. 'It is just another distressed circumstance that is part of Brad's normal life.' 'He wishes that everyone could be above it all since this situation involves people's lives, but emotions as they are between Pax, Angie and Brad are so bad that there will never be a time where it gets to a place where things are OK,' the insider said. However, another source close to Angelina claimed that Brad had made 'no effort' to try to see Pax since his crash. 'All Angelina wants is peace, but he is determined to continue fighting her and blaming everyone but himself for the situation he's now in,' they said. The source added that he was 'very lucky' to not have more significant injuries. 'It could have been much worse since he didn't wear a helmet,' they said; pictured in Los Angeles in November 2021 Pax was adopted by Angelina in Vietnam in 2007 at age three. Brad later joined her in adopting him in 2006; pictured in 2014 in Hollywood Angelina and Brad are legally divorced but are still fighting over the sale of Miraval, the vineyard in France; seen in 2006 Pax was adopted by Angelina in Vietnam in 2007 at age three. Brad later joined her in adopting him in 2006. Angelina and Brad are legally divorced but are still fighting over the sale of Miraval, the vineyard in France. Last week, the Eternals star accused Brad of trying to have her sign a $8.5 million non-disclosure agreement related to her allegations of abuse, according to People. She had previously accused him of assaulting her on a private jet while they were traveling with their children.

With Maya Rudolph’s wildly popular impression of Kamala Harris on “Saturday Night Live,” fans clamored to see who the late-night comedy show would pick to play Harris’ new running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. With similar hairstyles and their signature glasses, many fans quickly drew comparisons between Walz and Martin, who’s been a frequent “SNL” guest but never a formal cast member. The Los Angeles Times reported Wednesday that “SNL” producer Lorne Michaels called Martin to offer him the role on the upcoming 50th season, premiering Sept. 28, which he declined. “I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,” Martin said. “I said, ‘Lorne, I’m not an impressionist. You need someone who can really nail the guy.’ I was picked because I have gray hair and glasses.” Although Martin initially leaned into the fun, writing on social platform Threads that he “just learned that Tim Walz wants to go on the road with Marty Short,” he also noted the impression comes with a long-term commitment of performing on the show. “It’s ongoing,” Martin told the Times. “It’s not like you do it once and get applause and never do it again. Again, they need a real impressionist to do that. They’re gonna find somebody really, really good. I’d be struggling.” Rudolph, for her part, will reportedly reprise her Emmy-winning role on the show as Kamala Harris, and she seems to understand the undertaking. Deadline reported that Rudolph pushed the shooting schedule for the comedy series “Loot” from August to January to accommodate playing the role through the election season. Rudolph executive produces and stars in the series. The “Bridesmaids” actor first played “America’s funt” – or “fun aunt” – on “SNL” in 2019 when Harris was running for president and continued with the role after she was announced as Joe Biden’s running mate.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nLOS ANGELES – Steve Martin’s next role will not be the Midwestern&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Steve Martin Declines to Portray Tim Walz on &#8216;Saturday Night Live,&#8217; Disappointing Fans&#8217; Casting Dreams first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/steve-martin-declines-to-portray-tim-walz-on-saturday-night-live-disappointing-fans-casting-dreams/","image":"https://www.clickorlando.com/resizer/hK7M1NKQMr-nX8bB6Hl9t6DolvY=/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/gmg/AMTGY6RZMJCSDBYWPET4SYEQYA.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 00:35:24","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.009},{"id":253625338,"title":"Steve Martin refuses Tim Walz role on 'SNL' despite pleas from fans","text":"Steve Martin is not interested in impersonating Kamala Harris' running mate, Governor Tim Walz, on \"Saturday Night Live\" – despite pleas from fans. Shortly after Harris announced the Minnesota Gov. would be her running mate, Martin spoke to the Los Angeles Times about receiving a phone call from \"SNL\" producer Lorne Michaels asking him to appear on the famed comedy show. \"I wanted to say no and, by the way, he wanted me to say no,\" Martin told the outlet about his phone call with Michaels. \"I said, 'Lorne, I’m not an impressionist.

Martin referenced his \"Only Murders in the Building\" co-star Martin Short in his post, which prompted fans to point out the physical similarities between Martin and Walz. LIKE WHAT YOU’RE READING?

The US election's just got even more weird","text":"They say Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate after being impressed by his description of her rival, Donald Trump, as ‘weird’. For some reason, the insult had taken off, and had clearly rankled the one person it was meant to rankle: Trump himself. Interviewed by the radio host Clay Travis, Trump was still smouldering. ‘Nobody’s ever called me weird.’ Weirdly, he then repeated the same sentence: ‘Nobody’s ever called me weird.’ He then added: ‘I’m a lot of things, but weird I’m not.’ Walz, the governor of Midwest state Minnesota, also described the Republican vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance, as ‘weird’, and this also upset Trump. ‘I will tell you. J.D. is not at all. They are. We’re not weird people. We’re actually just the opposite.’ It’s strange – weird, even – that everyone seems to have forgotten the first time the word ‘weird’ was publicly apTplied to Trump. It was seven years ago, on January 20, 2017, and it happened outside the Capitol Building in Washington DC. President Trump had taken his oath of office, and many imagined he would go on to deliver an inaugural address that was dignified and statesmanlike. Instead, he launched into a tirade, portraying America as broken, with ‘rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation’. He blamed it on previous presidents, before announcing: ‘The American carnage stops right here, right now . . . From this moment on, it’s going to be America First.’ When Trump’s rant came to an end, former President George W. Bush turned to the defeated candidate, Hillary Clinton, and said the immortal words: ‘Well, that was some weird s**t.’ Appropriately enough, the word ‘weird’ is itself weird. Just look at the way it is spelt: if it were a conventional word, we would spell it ‘wierd’. But no: it is one of those odd-bod words, like ‘beige’ or ‘heist’ that refuses to obey the rule every schoolchild knows – ‘i before e except after c’. The word ‘weird’ has gone in and out of fashion. Around 1400, it was spelt ‘wierd’, developed from the Old English ‘wyrd’, and meant ‘having the power to control the fate of men’, which certainly qualifies Donald Trump as wierd or wyrd, if not weird. It then fell from favour until 1606, when various characters in Macbeth referred to the three witches as the ‘Weird Sisters’. Alas, Shakespeare neglected to pen a speech in which a witch hits back, saying: ‘Nobody’s ever called me weird. I’m a lot of things, but weird I’m not.’ Ever since its revival in Macbeth, people have used the adjective ‘weird’ to mean strange. Is it purely coincidental that Trump was born in 1946, which, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, was just three years before the adjective became the noun ‘weirdie’? By 1955, ‘weirdie’ had become ‘weirdo’, which is still popular today. Until recently, weirdos were easily identifiable as people who talked to themselves in public. If you spotted someone coming towards you talking gibberish at the top of their voice, you would swerve away and avert your eyes. But since the advent of the mobile phone, the weirdos have taken over. These days, every other person in the street is chatting at full volume, even though no one is walking alongside them. Donald Trump’s speeches have increasingly become unstructured rambles around the interior of his skull, addressed to everyone and no one. ‘I’ve got to be the cleanest – I think I’m the most honest human being, perhaps, that God has ever created,’ he told a rally in North Carolina in 2022. Last year, for no discernible reason, he rambled on about sharks to a rally in Iowa: ‘If I’m sitting down and that boat is going down and I’m on top of a battery and the water starts flooding in, I’m getting concerned. ‘But then I look ten yards to my left and there’s a shark over there, so I have a choice of electrocution or a shark. You know what I’m going to take? Electrocution. I will take electrocution every single time. Do we agree? Yeah, I will take electrocution.’ Perhaps this is why Tim Walz’s observation hit its target: because if anyone in your neighbourhood started speaking like that, you would definitely think ‘weirdo’, before walking swiftly on.","summary":"CRAIG BROWN: They say Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate after being impressed by his description of her rival, Donald Trump , as 'weird'.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-13721307/CRAIG-BROWN-Look-elections-just-got-weird.html?ns_mchannel=rss&ns_campaign=1490&ito=1490","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2024/08/08/01/88288597-0-image-m-108_1723075318747.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 00:32:52","author":"Craig Brown,Editor","authors":["Craig Brown","Editor"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"GB","sentiment":-0.225},{"id":253625210,"title":"Biden says he’s ‘not confident’ in peaceful transfer of power if Trump loses White House race","text":"Joe Biden says he is “not confident at all” that there will be a peaceful transfer of power if Donald Trump loses the 2024 presidential election. The president said that Trump needed to be taken seriously over his March comments that there would be a “bloodbath” for the US car industry and country should he be defeated in November. The White House claimed at the time that the former president was inciting violence, which he rejected. Biden made the comments to CBS News during his first sit-down interview since officially halting his reelection campaign and handing over the reins of the Democratic party to Kamala Harris. Asked about his confidence in a peaceful transference of power, he replied: “If Trump wins. No, I’m not confident at all.” The president quickly corrected himself, saying: “I mean, if Trump loses, I’m not confident at all. “He means what he says. We don’t take him seriously. He means it. All the stuff about ‘if we lose, there’ll be a bloodbath’. [The elections] have to be stolen, look what they’re trying to do now in the local election districts. “You can’t love your country, only when you win.” On January 6 2021, just three weeks before Biden was due to be sworn in as president, Trump gave a speech to thousands of supporters in Washington DC. Speaking from behind bulletproof glass he declared that he would \"never concede\" the election, which he claimed had been stolen from him, criticized the media and called for his own vice president, Mike Pence, to overturn the election results. Supporters of the former president then marched to the United States Capitol Building and stormed the building, aiming to prevent a joint session of Congress from counting the Electoral College votes to formalize Biden’s victory. Within 36 hours of the insurrection, five people died: one was shot by Capitol Police, another died of a drug overdose, and three died of natural causes, including a police officer. Many people were injured, including 174 police officers. The FBI says that in the 42 months since the attack on the Capitol, more than 1,470 individuals have been charged in nearly all 50 states for crimes related to the breach, including more than 530 individuals charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.","summary":"The president said that his former political rival needed to be taken seriously over his previous incendiary rhetoric","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/biden-trump-transfer-power-election-b2593017.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/08/00/newFile-1.jpg?width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 00:29:59","author":"Mike Bedigan","authors":["Mike Bedigan"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.493},{"id":253625336,"title":"LAURA INGRAHAM: The Democratic Party decided to avoid discussing Kamala's record","text":"Fox News host Laura Ingraham calls out Democrats for avoiding balanced discussion of Vice President Kamala Harris’ record on \"The Ingraham Angle.\" LAURA INGRAHAM: After Biden and Harris pushed America to the edge of an economic abyss, the party has decided to avoid discussing Kamala's record.

Tim Walz, stumped in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. The pair made a stop at Detroit-Wayne County airport that evening. Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio), Republican presidential nominee former President Donald Trump’s running mate, spoke outside the Shelby Township Police Department in Michigan on Wednesday morning before hosting his own event in Eau Claire that afternoon. At the Harris–Walz rally in Eau Claire, Walz leaned into his Midwestern roots, touting his upbringing in small-town Nebraska, his 24-year military service, and his experience as a high school teacher and coach. “I have to say, this idea of caring for our neighboring kindness and [a] hand up when somebody needs it, or just the sense of that people go through things and to be able to be there when they need it, that’s who we are,” Walz told the packed crowd in Eau Claire. Vance’s Shelby Township speech highlighted crime and illegal immigration, keying on an alleged rape committed by an illegal immigrant in that community. The suspect had previously been deported from the United States. In Eau Claire, Vance visited a Wollard International manufacturing plant to underscore the importance of American manufacturing. “I’m one of these guys who believes that it’s important that we make more things right here in the USA,” Vance said, appealing to voters in the country’s manufacturing hub. “Come on, that’s not who Wisconsin is, that’s not who Minnesota is,” Walz said. Harris, speaking after Walz, pledged to ensure a future where “every worker has the freedom to join a union,” drawing cheers from the crowd. The vice president called herself and her running mate “joyful warriors.” The Midwest, particularly Michigan and Wisconsin, is seen as crucial to securing the White House. The states have 15 and 10 electoral college votes, respectively. Democrats won both in 2020 with narrow margins after Republicans carried them in 2016. They are often referred to as the “Blue Wall,” along with Minnesota and Illinois, but have become swing states in recent elections. As Harris and Trump remain neck and neck in the Midwest, Walz’s potential appeal to this region and swing state voters is seen as one reason he may have been given the vice presidential nod over Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro.","summary":"Both campaigns made stops in Wisconsin and Michigan, Vance stumped on immigration and manufacturing, Harris and Walz on labor.","url":"https://www.theepochtimes.com/us/harris-walz-duel-with-vance-in-midwest-rallies-5701730","image":"https://img.theepochtimes.com/assets/uploads/2024/08/07/id5701766-GettyImages-2165252210-300x180.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 00:24:05","author":"Jacob Burg","authors":["Jacob Burg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.233},{"id":253624994,"title":"Biden’s team lays out plan for the next six months","text":"By Betsy Klein | CNN (CNN) — President Joe Biden has tasked his team with coming up with an agenda for his final six months in office, defining key priorities for the administration as he looks to secure a one-term legacy – including a robust schedule on the world stage. On a call with political appointees across agencies Wednesday afternoon, White House chief of staff Jeff Zients laid out four main pillars for Biden’s team to execute in a lame duck period: the continued implementation of key legislation; lowering costs and growing the economy through additional moves on student debt relief and efforts to bring down prescription drug prices; defending personal freedoms and civil rights by calling out hate and extremism; and ensuring US strength, security and leadership in the world, according to audio of the call obtained by CNN. On the fourth point, national security adviser Jake Sullivan suggested Biden would keep a busy schedule in international matters: “You can expect to see very busy months of activity, of summits and trips to ensure that we do everything we can to leave it on the field,” Sullivan said, adding that there would be “high-level summits both here and abroad.” But before that, Sullivan said Biden’s most urgent priority “is to avoid escalation into a larger war in the Middle East and to deliver the ceasefire and hostage deal that he’s worked so hard to deliver.” Those comments come as the US is working through diplomatic channels – including Biden calls with the Egyptian president and the emir of Qatar this week – amid heightened tensions in the Middle East. Hezbollah has vowed retaliation for Israel’s assassination of a top commander. Sullivan also defined Biden’s hopes and expectations for the war in Ukraine as the clock ticks on his time in office with no immediate resolution in view: “President Biden is determined to put Ukraine in a position to prevail and ensure that Russia fails in its effort to conquer Ukraine. And he wants them in the best possible position on the battlefield so they’re in the best possible position at the negotiating table. And you can expect a flurry of work, along with our partners, with President Zelensky to achieve that result before he passes the baton.” He also noted that the Biden administration will be rolling out a “major national security memorandum on artificial intelligence” in the coming weeks. Zients told the team that Biden encouraged his top lieutenants to form a plan “to finish as strong as we started” when he announced last month that he would not seek a second term and endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris. Biden, Zients said, “asked us to continue to push the envelope and look for opportunities for new policy in addition to the implementation of legislation and current policy,” but he conceded that some efforts that require new legislation could be “challenging” given time constraints and a divided Congress. “Even if we can’t get the legislation passed, it’s really important to put a stake in the ground,” Zients said, pointing to last week’s rollout of Biden’s proposed Supreme Court reforms. He encouraged the team to spend the next month recharging before the final stretch. “August, this month is a good period to get a little rest and recharge. … I encourage you to do that, and I encourage your teams to do it too because we all want to run through that tape together through January 21,” Zients said. Political appointees typically turn over from administration to administration. With Biden no longer running for reelection, it is unclear whether a potential Harris administration would keep Biden’s political appointees in place, though there would likely be some turnover. And while there is sometimes overlap for continuity, along with career officials, most of Biden’s political appointees would be unlikely to stay in a potential second Trump term.","summary":"President Biden’s most urgent priority “is to avoid escalation into a larger war in the Middle East and to deliver the ceasefire and hostage deal that he’s worked so hard to deliver.”","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/08/07/bidens-team-lays-out-plan-for-the-next-six-months/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sjm-019686.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 00:19:39","author":"Cnn.com Wire Service","authors":["Cnn.com Wire Service"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":253624764,"title":"Kamala Harris takes the stage after Tim Walz speaks at Detroit rally – live","text":"“We’ll beat him in November.

Yet as the memoir unfolds, the danger of resentment is something that he gradually forgets.\"\"In one of his first jobs, he comes to see fellow co-workers as 'immune to hard work,'\" he continues. \"And as he slowly moves from rags to riches himself, his resentment only multiplies ... As he grows richer, he seems to find more flaws in his fellow citizens.\"Dowland goes on to tie Hillbilly Elegy to Vance's transformation after the memoir was published, when the future senator went from pondering whether Trump was \"America's Hitler\" to frequently praising the former president as his running mate.After writing that the book presents \"a vision of America as a nation of 'us' versus 'them' makes it impossible for him to extend a hand, to help another up the ladder,\" Dowland argues that \"Vance is so fascinated by identifying foes that he is uninterested in finding friends.\"Dowland then mentions Vance's \"childless cat ladies\" comment as an example of the senator offering \"gambits of gratuitous generalization\" to advance his political pursuits, before warning that \"the end of the American story\" could come if the Republican ticket wins in November.\"'Hillbilly Elegy' was the prelude to this,\" Dowland writes. \"It shows the limits of an American story. And, worryingly, that story, as it is shaped and resentfully reshaped by the hands of the now-candidate for vice president, may very well be the prelude to the end of the American story.\"Newsweek reached out for comment to Vance's office and the Trump/Vance campaign via email on Wednesday evening.While Hillbilly Elegy was a bestseller when it was published and has gone on to enjoy further success following Vance's Republican Party ascendancy, Dowland is far from the only critic to take issue with both the book and the senator's political messaging.In an opinion article published by Newsweek late last month, Arick Wierson, television producer and ex-adviser to former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, argued that Vance was paying \"hollow lip service\" to \"rural voters and small town America,\" while asserting that Minnesota Governor Tim Walz—whom Vice President Kamala Harris announced as her running mate on Tuesday—would be the perfect antidote.\"Walz is the real deal,\" Wierson wrote. \"In fact, it's not hard to see Tim Walz as the very guy who, if selected as Harris' VP pick, could effectively turn Vance's Hillbilly Elegy into Vance's very own hillbilly political eulogy.\"","summary":"The 2024 Republican vice presidential nominee was denounced for pushing a narrative of \"endless resentment\" in his 2016 memoir.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jd-vances-rags-riches-story-ripped-home-state-newspaper-1936212","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2445544/jd-vance-hillbilly-elegy-ripped-ohio-newspaper.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 00:16:16","author":"Aila Slisco","authors":["Aila Slisco"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.262},{"id":253625252,"title":"Who Should Play Tim Walz on ‘Saturday Night Live’?","text":"“Saturday Night Live” has already booked Maya Rudolph to return as Vice President Kamala Harris, but who should play her newly named running mate, Midwestern nice guy and governor of Minnesota Tim Walz? The most apparently obvious candidate — similarly white-haired comedian Steve Martin — has, sadly, already turned down the gig as of Wednesday. But fear not, we’ve got plenty of other suggestions for Lorne Michaels to consider, including A-listers like Tom Hanks, Brad Pitt and John Goodman. Read on for our full list below! Tom Hanks The very wholesome two-time Oscar winner Hanks, who is 68, has hosted “Saturday Night Live” a whopping 10 times, including as Halloween icon David S. Pumpkins. And we’ve already seen him with white hair when he played heroic pilot Chesley “Sully” Sullenberger in the 2016 biopic from Clint Eastwood. And he kind of looked like Walz when he hosted a COVID-era “SNL” from his house when the actor was bald and wearing glasses. Jim Gaffigan Gaffigan, native Midwesterner (who was born in Elgin, Illinois and attended high school in LaPorte, Indiana), famously does not swear in his stand-up — which makes two solid arguments why he’d be a great fit for the job. And he’s only two years younger than Walz. You probably know him best from film roles in “13 Going on 30,” “17 Again” or “Unfrosted.” He’s also starred in his own series: 2000’s “Welcome to New York” and “The Jim Gaffigan Show,” which ran from 2015 to 2016 on TV Land. Al Franken Former “SNL” star Franken, who’s 73, has all the necessary requirements to step into Walz’s shoes: He’s from Minnesota, he’s been both a politician and a comedian … and he knows how to correctly pronounce the VP candidate’s last name. He shared a photo of himself with the Minnesota governor to X on Tuesday with a caption that read, “Veteran, teacher, football coach, congressman, governor. And he’s not weird!” Julia Sweeney Sweeney, the now white-haired 64-year-old comedian actress and author, who was on “SNL” from 1990 to 1994, suggested on Wednesday that she should be the one to play Walz. Her best-known character was Pat, an ambiguously androgynous person whose gender remained a mystery. The subsequent movie wasn’t great, but we also love Sweeney for the documentary “God Said Ha!” and her consulting work on “Sex and the City” and “Desperate Housewives.” Danny DeVito “Taxi” and “It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” star DeVito is better known for playing short-tempered curmudgeons, but in a pinch, we could see the New Jersey native gently slam GOP rival JD Vance with the actual Waltz quote: “I can’t wait to debate the guy. That is, if he’s willing to get off the couch and show up.” Jack McBrayer A former “30 Rock” regular, McBrayer has a reputation for being politeness personified, particularly as NBC page Kenneth Parcell. He kept the niceness going with his Apple TV+ series “Hello, Jack! The Kindness Show.” The actor, who also voiced the Fix-It Felix character in the “Wreck-It Ralph” films, hails from the South, not the Midwest, but he did attend the University of Evansville in Indiana. John Goodman As the patriarch of “Roseanne” and spin-off “The Conners,” Goodman has spent a lot of time in the Midwest (fictional Lanford, Illinois, to be precise), and we think he’d be a great pick. Of course, when we hear that voice, we also think of Sully from “Monsters, Inc.” Molly Kearney Kearney just announced their exit from “SNL” a few days ago, but maybe NBC honchos could woo them back? The 32-year-old, who uses they/them pronouns, convincingly played a senior citizen twice their age in a recent “Elder PSA” skit. After playing more than one memorable nun on the sketch comedy series, Kearney joked to Cleveland Magazine earlier this year, “I’m either men or nuns, and I love my typecast. I’ll do it for the rest of my life.” Brad Pitt OK, we’re not seriously suggesting that Pitt play Walz, but it’s as good an occasion as any to remember the time he donned a white wig to play Dr. Anthony Fauci in an April 2020 skit. Fauci had jokingly requested the “Fight Club” star should play him and Pitt was happy to comply for the one-shot appearance.","summary":"Steve Martin has already passed on the opportunity, but here's some funny people who might be up for the gig\n\n\nThe post Who Should Play Tim Walz on &#8216;Saturday Night Live&#8217;? appeared first on TheWrap.","url":"https://www.thewrap.com/who-should-play-tim-walz-on-snl/","image":"https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tim-walz-aug-7-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 00:09:16","author":"Sharon Knolle","authors":["Sharon Knolle"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.543},{"id":253625660,"title":"Feds arrest rioter for threatening Justice Barrett on Jan. 6","text":"A Nevada man awaiting trial for criminal charges tied to the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has been arrested once more following violent threats he made targeting U.S. Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland. A bond revocation hearing for Bradley Nelson will be held on Aug. 14 in Washington, D.C., before U.S. District Judge John Bates, according to a minute entry on the docket reviewed Wednesday by Law&Crime. Court records show following Nelson’s March 2023 arrest, he was released with conditions including no drugs, guns, or any travel to Washington, D.C., but did not specify restrictions for his social media use. Now prosecutors say they have found a litany of disturbing and threatening social media posts from Nelson concerning a variety of public officials and that he should be put back in jail since he poses a danger to the public. In August 2023, prosecutors allege Nelson posted an image online of a Georgia state judge handling the Donald Trump election interference case with “apparent crosshairs drawn on his head.” The judge handling the currently waylaid racketeering case in Georgia alleging Trump and several others engaged in a “fake electors” scheme is Fulton County Superior Court Judge Scott McAfee, who is not named in the detention order for Nelson. In February 2024, prosecutors allege Nelson posted an image of New York Attorney General Letitia James — who handled Trump’s civil fraud prosecution — with crosshairs on her head too. This time, the photo was accompanied by threatening commentary from Nelson allegedly including: “give every [expletive] thing I have to watch that [expletive]’s head explode, or at least the back of her head blowout.” And then, in June, mere hours after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Fischer v. United States agreeing to narrow the application of an obstruction statute used to prosecute Jan. 6 rioters, Nelson allegedly set eyes on Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett. Barrett, appointed by former President Donald Trump, broke with her conservative colleagues in a sharply written dissenting opinion in Fischer v. United States. She wrote, as Law&Crime reported, that it was clear the certification of the election on Jan. 6, 2021, by Congress was an “official proceeding” under the meaning of the obstruction statute at challenge. Attempts by the high court’s majority to narrow the statute by suggesting that it only applied to the obstruction of official documents or records struck Barrett as nonsensical. She called out the majority for engaging in “textual backflips” to reach its conclusion. “I pray to God with all my [expletive] heart that somebody cuts your [expletive] throat from ear to ear you worthless piece of [expletive],” Nelson allegedly wrote hours after that dissent was published. That post also included an image of the justice. The alleged threat against Attorney General Garland came in July. Nelson posted a photo of Garland with crosshairs on his head too, according to prosecutors. There were videos from June 28 that he posted online less than 10 minutes apart as well, according to prosecutors, and in each, he lashed out at the FBI, even offering in one clip to “get into ‘the MMA ring with you two pieces of [expletive].” MMA is an abbreviation for mixed martial arts. In one of those alleged threats, he also referred to the “FBI [expletive] math teacher.” “The government proffers that the lead case agent in this investigation was a math teacher before joining the FBI,” an Aug. 6 opinion and order to detain Nelson notes. Nelson referred to a second FBI agent who interviewed him following his initial March 2023 arrest as well. Notably, Nelson referred to that agent as a “Stabler-looking person,” referring to a character on the television show “Law&Order: SVU” known as Elliot Stabler. Nelson was described by agents as being so aggressive with them following his first March 2023 interview that a U.S. Marshal had to escort one of the FBI agents to their car due to safety concerns. Nelson was ordered into detention on Tuesday and will be held until his bond revocation hearing next week. It seems unlikely he would be granted release in the wake of increasing threats against public officials like Vice President Kamala Harris and a recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Law&Crime reported on Monday that a man who threatened to “personally pluck out” the vice president’s eyes was arrested in Virginia. Nelson was set to go to trial on Sept. 18 until prosecutors had requested proceedings be continued for at least 45 days so the case and pretrial discovery could be tweaked in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in Fischer. Now a pretrial conference is set for Nov. 21 with a trial date of Dec. 10. He has pleaded not guilty to the Jan. 6 charges which include: 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a)(1)- Entering and Remaining in a Restricted Building or Grounds; 18 U.S.C. § 1752(a)(2)- Disorderly and Disruptive Conduct in a Restricted Building or Grounds; 40 U.S.C. § 5104(e)(2)(D)- Disorderly Conduct in a Capitol Building; and 40 U.S.C. § 5104(e)(2)(G)- Parading, Demonstrating, or Picketing in a Capitol Building.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nOn the left side of the image, Bradley Nelson is seen at&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Feds arrest rioter for threatening Justice Barrett on Jan. 6 first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/crime/feds-arrest-rioter-for-threatening-justice-barrett-on-jan-6/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Jan-6-rioter-arrested-after-threat-to-Justice-Barrett-Feds.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-08 00:09:02","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.361},{"id":253625208,"title":"Vance shadows Harris and Walz in battleground states","text":"Vance shadows Harris and Walz in battleground states Both major parties held rallies in key battleground states Wednesday.

The Harris campaign is defending Walz, an Army veteran who spent nearly a quarter-century in the Minnesota National Guard, from Republicans who are claiming he deserted to avoid deployment to Iraq and falsely accusing him of claiming to be a combat veteran. His GOP opponent, Trump running-mate and Ohio senator JD Vance, made the disturbing allegations during a media availability in Wisconsin ahead of a massive Harris-Walz rally in the Badger State. He told reporters that Walz, who retired from the Minnesota guard after 24 years of service to run for Congress in the 2006 election, had “dropped out of the army and allowed his unit to go [to Iraq] without him.” Vance also accused Walz of falsely claiming to have seen combat, citing comments the Minnesotan had made about not wanting “weapons of war” to be available on American streets. The Ohio senator’s accusation that his opponent ditched his guard unit rather than deploy to combat is patently false. According to military records, Walz officially retired from the Minnesota National Guard in May 2005, two months before his unit received word that it would be deployed, four months before deployment preparations began and ten months before the unit deployed. In a statement, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson strongly pushed back against Vance’s claim that Walz had “dropped out” rather than deploy with the men he led, instead accurately describing the governor’s separation from service as a normal retirement after nearly a quarter-century in uniform. “After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,” they said. According to Army records, Walz’s nearly two and a half decades in the Minnesota Guard began at age 17 and ended with him holding the rank of Command Sergeant Major, the highest possible rank for an enlisted soldier. Like most National Guard soldiers, he was frequently deployed in response to national disasters, but he also was sent overseas to Italy in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the US mission to Afghanistan that toppled the Taliban in the wake of the September 11 attacks. The campaign spokesperson also pushed back on Vance’s claim that Walz had falsely claimed to have carried arms against the enemy by noting that he never claimed to have seen combat. “The Governor carried, fired and trained others to use weapons of war innumerable times,” they said, including by specializing in heavy artillery to the point of suffering hearing damage as a result of exposure to decades of heavy gun blasts. They added that Walz “would never insult or undermine any American’s service to this country” and said he thanks Vance for having “put his life on the line” by deploying to Iraq as a public affairs specialist with the US Marine Corps. The attacks against the governor appear to be the brainchild of Chris LaCivita, one of the two GOP operatives who run former president Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign. Twenty years ago, he was one of the consultants who orchestrated a smear campaign against John Kerry, then a Massachusetts senator and the Democratic challenger who sought to deny Bush a second term in the White House. The campaign was the work of a GOP group called “Swift Boat Veterans for Truth,” ostensibly made up of Vietnam veterans who served with Kerry, a US Navy veteran who earned a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star while commanding small riverine craft in the Vietnamese jungles. It was 2004, just three years removed from the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, and Kerry was running against Bush — and in opposition to the US-led war in Iraq — by invoking his military service. Opinion polls at the time showed that Americans saw Kerry’s record as a positive and put him ahead of Bush after the party nominating conventions that year. The “Swift Boat Veterans” group responded by airing television ads in which purported veterans who claimed to have served with Kerry criticized him and accused him of being dishonest about his service record. It wasn’t true. Only one of the people in the ad had actually served alongside Kerry, and the claims they made about Kerry’s alleged dishonesty didn’t hold up to independent fact-checking. But the damage was done, and Kerry would go on to lose the 2004 election to Bush. Two decades later, with Trump foundering in the polls against Harris and Walz, LaCivita began telegraphing his intention to dust off his “Swift Boat” playbook just minutes after Walz was announced as Harris’s running-mate. In response to a post on X (formerly Twitter) noting that Walz — a former Command Sergeant Major in the Minnesota guard — was the highest-ranking enlisted soldier to ever serve in the US Congress during his decade in the House of Representatives, LaCivita wrote that the would-be vice president “deserted his men and quit before they went to combat.” A person close to the Harris-Walz campaign told The Independent that the vice president and a host of surrogates plan to push back hard against any attempt to “swift boat” the Minnesota governor and said LaCivita’s playbook “will not work this time.” “It’s a tired, old strategy and the American people are too smart to fall for that, especially from anyone allied with a draft dodger like Donald Trump,” they said. Rick Wilson, a former GOP operative who founded and runs the anti-Trump Lincoln Project super PAC, told The Independent that LaCivita’s decision to go after Walz’s military record is a sign that he’s increasingly desperate and trying to keep from being fired by Trump as the ex-president loses ground to Harris and Walz. “Chris is worried about getting fired right now, so obviously he’s going to do everything and can to play the LaCivita greatest hits album. If Donald Trump wasn’t bunkered down in Mar-a-Lago hiding like a f*****g psychopath, it might be more effective,” Wilson said. He added that the attacks against Walz have “a fat Elvis imitator vibe” from “some guy playing in a casino/gas station 27 miles out of Elko, Nevada.” “Chris and Susie are in real trouble in Trump world, and it’s not getting any better,” he said. LaCivita did not respond to a request for comment from The Independent.","summary":"Attacks on Tim Walz’s military service echo false smears leveled against John Kerry in 2004","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/democrats-push-back-as-trumpworld-dusts-off-swift-boat-attack-on-walz-b2593010.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/07/01/newFile.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mZjP8sH4-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-08 00:06:23","author":"Andrew Feinberg","authors":["Andrew Feinberg"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.228},{"id":253624106,"title":"Harris, Walz hit campaign trail in battleground states","text":"Harris, Walz hit campaign trail in battleground states One day after Vice President Kamala Harris announced Minnesota Gov.

Cuban endorsed Trump's previous opponents, Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden, and Trump's 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris, while berating Trump with insults dating back to 2016. But Cuban was not always a Trump basher. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM Cuban has said he supported the former president when Trump initially launched his first presidential campaign in 2015. Cuban elaborated on his initial support of Trump during an interview with Vivek Ramaswamy on X Wednesday. \"In 2015, I was like, ‘He's great. He's not a typical Stepford candidate. I thought that was a positive,\" Cuban said. Cuban added that one of the biggest reasons he initially supported Trump was because he didn't believe in Trump's chances to actually win the presidency and was looking to simply make a statement about the state of American politics. \"A big part of that is I didn't think he had a chance. I just wanted to kind of screw things up in traditional politics, which I'm not a fan of,\" Cuban said. Cuban was so enamored by Trump in 2015, the \"Shark Tank\" host even said he would consider being Trump's running mate in the 2016 election in an interview with Business Insider in July 2015. Cuban previously praised Trump and what he stood for in a post on Cuban's own \"Cyberdust\" social media app earlier that month, highlighting the fact that Trump didn't come from a traditional political background. MARK CUBAN SLAMS ELON MUSK OVER TRUMP SUPPORT \"I don't care what his actual positions are,\" Cuban wrote on the app. \"I don't care if he says the wrong thing. He says what's on his mind. He gives honest answers rather than prepared answers. This is more important than anything any candidate has done in years.\" But times have changed. Cuban quickly backpedaled on his support for Trump deeper into the 2016 election cycle and has hurled insults at the former president ever since. Cuban pointed to Trump's ethics for why he has opposed him as president since 2016 in the interview with Ramaswamy. \"He was unethical then, and he's unethical now,\" Cuban said. Cuban then pointed to Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election as an example of his ethics. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"The man told Mike Pence not to certify the election,\" Cuban said of Trump. \"The man has stolen from more hard-working Americans than any [president].\" Earlier this year when Biden was still the presumptive Democratic nominee, Cuban went so far as to say he would vote for Biden over Trump even if Biden was \"being given his last rites.\" \"If they were having his last wake, and it was him versus Trump, and he was being given last rites, I would still vote for Joe Biden,\" Cuban told Bloomberg News in March.

OK, we already know the answer to that; there is very little about Harris that is genuine other than her word salads and her grating laugh; her running mate Tim Walz is no better. And while campaign events are frequently, as Ed Sullivan would have put it, a “really big show,” with opening acts and so on, it sure seems like Kamala Harris can’t fill up a broom closet, much less a major venue, without some kind of draw – because the people sure don’t seem to be coming out to see her. In the latest such instance, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, she held a rally and her campaign ballyhooed the line of people waiting to get in. Here’s the catch: They were waiting to get in to see a local celebrity musician, one Bon Iver, who gave a free concert as an in-kind campaign contribution (which I am sure will be properly reported as such – right? Right?): OMG! The Kamala Harris Rally Line in Eau Claire, Wisconsin is soooo long!What’s not being reported is that they got Bon Iver, who is a local from Eau Claire, Wisconsin, a Grammy-Award winning music artist to perform at the rally.So basically, it’s another free concert..… pic.twitter.com/wRui7ELdkw— MJTruthUltra (@MJTruthUltra) August 7, 2024 Yeah, another free show – and another instance in which the folks walk out when the band is done? My friend and colleague Brandon Morse described another such event on Wednesday, July 31st: Brandon wrote: Moreover, when she was done and Harris took the stage, people began leaving. — John Basham (@JohnBasham) July 31, 2024 Now on that last bit – as far as leaving when Harris took the stage; I can’t blame the folks for that. Indeed, it shows uncommon good sense, especially for Democrats, to bail the heck out on an appearance by the Queen of Word Salads. But the non-genuine image-mongering just gets more and more – and I hate using this word, but it’s just so apt – cringe. There’s just nothing genuine about any of this. Whatever one thinks of Donald Trump, there can be no doubt that the man can fill a venue, or that he knows how to fire up a crowd; I saw him speak at CPAC last February, and the excitement in the room was palpable; I admit that I got caught up in it myself. While he has performers at his rallies from time to time, there is no doubt that Donald Trump is the main attraction, and people are lining up to see Trump – not “Megan Thee Stallion.” (Shouldn’t that really be “Megan Thee Mare?) And I think that’s a big part of the man’s appeal. There’s no shilly-shallying, no pretense; what you see is what you get. Is it really surprising, though, that so many lefties are taken in by this outpouring of astroturf? We could always ask Bob Hope.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIs there anything about Kamala Harris and her presidential campaign that is&#8230;&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Kamala Harris&#8217; Campaign Offers Second Rally with Free Concert in Wisconsin to Attract Attendees first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/kamala-harris-campaign-offers-second-rally-with-free-concert-in-wisconsin-to-attract-attendees/","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/214/0b80bf61-8f52-4f6a-b78a-24153303b961.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 23:49:34","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.158},{"id":253623576,"title":"Democrats unite behind Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket","text":"Democrats unite behind Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket Republicans are looking to brand Minnesota Gov.

We don’t take him seriously. He means it. All this stuff about if we lose there’d be a bloodbath,” Biden added. During a March campaign appearance in Ohio, Trump warned of a “bloodbath” if he fails to win the election. At the time Trump was discussing the need to protect the U.S. auto industry from overseas competition, and Trump later said he was referring to the auto industry when he used the term. Trump has falsely claimed he won the 2020 election against Biden and was criminally charged in Washington, D.C., and Georgia with illegally trying to overturn the results. Biden dropped out of the campaign last month after fellow Democrats called for him to step aside following a poor debate performance against Trump that raised questions about the Democratic president’s age and health. Biden’s vice president, Kamala Harris, has since captured the Democratic nomination and is running against Trump.","summary":"WASHINGTON >> President Joe Biden said on Wednesday he was not confident about a peaceful transfer of power in the United States if Republican Donald Trump loses the Nov. 5 presidential election.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2024/08/07/breaking-news/biden-not-confident-of-peaceful-power-transition-if-trump-loses/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/web1_2024-08-07T220048Z_97975267_RC2H59AUMOSE_RTRMADP_3_USA-ELECTION-BIDEN.JPG","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 23:33:00","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.591},{"id":253623210,"title":"How Harris-Walz ticket could impact down-ballot races","text":"How Harris-Walz ticket could impact down-ballot races CBS News polling reveals that Kamala Harris has completely changed the 2024 race for the White House.

Major. In fact, he was demoted after bugging out when his unit was called up to serve in Iraq in 2005. That’s the opposite of real leadership, and all too fitting for the Harris-Walz ticket. He “slithered out the door,” charge two of his former Guard colleagues, Command Sgts. Major Thomas Behrends and Paul Herr (both now retired), leaving the unit “hanging without its senior Non-Commissioned Officer, as the battalion prepared for war.” Yes, Walz had every legal right to leave when he did, after two decades of peacetime service, but countless other Guardsmen (and reservists) didn’t bow out when the call came. More: Despite multiple claims to the contrary over the years, Walz never served in combat. Yet he keeps mocking his GOP counterpart, J.D. Vance — who did come under fire as a Marine in Iraq. Kudos to Vance for trying to confront Walz and Kamala Harris on a Wisconsin tarmac Wednesday — and for needling his opponents and the press over Harris’ teleprompter-only record since moving to the top of the Democratic ticket. “I also thought you guys might get lonely because the vice president doesn’t answer questions from reporters and hasn’t for 17 days,” he told the traveling campaign reporters. And: “Have they given you guys an explanation for why she won’t take questions from reporters?” That gets directly to Harris’ leadership failures: No one can point to anything she’s achieved as vice president, especially in her role as “border czar.” Nor has she outlined any ways in which she’ll break with Joe Biden’s disastrous policies on the economy or the border — the voters’ top two issues. Heck, she still has to fill in any policies on her campaign website. And four-minute off-the-record “gaggles” on Air Force Two don’t count. Meanwhile, Vance and Donald Trump take questions regularly. They’re not afraid to face the press and Trump has never failed to confront a challenge facing the nation. The Harris strategy seems to be to coast to Election Day on not being Biden, hoping the voters keep treating her as a fresh face — the only two factors that explain how she’s narrowed the Trump-Vance lead in the polls. With the national media largely in the tank, this may buy her another week or two, but the voters aren’t that stupid. Walz isn’t getting away with lying about his service, and Harris won’t get away with hiding forever from live interviews and tough questions. Americans recognize leadership — and its opposite.","summary":"It took less than a day for Tim Walz to start unraveling: It turns out Kamala Harris’ running mate lied for years about leaving the National Guard with the high rank of Command Sgt.

But this wasn’t just any sorority, it was Alpha Kappa Alpha, the historic Black sorority Harris joined in college, and one of the Divine Nine – also known as the Pan-Hellenic Council – the most powerful Black sororities in America. “To my line sisters, the 38 Jewels of Iridescent Splendor: Oh, you are such an incredible part of my journey,” she said. AKA was founded in 1908 at Harris’s alma mater, Howard University, as a support network for Black women, who at the time faced increasing racial discrimination. Harris’s aunt was a soror in 1950. Among the sorority’s alumna were Coretta Scott King, Toni Morrison and Maya Angelou. For her Vogue cover in 2021, Harris was photographed in front of a background of draped fabric in AKA’s colours, salmon pink and apple green, and wearing its signature accessory – a pearl necklace. In the two weeks since Biden stood down, and then became the presumptive nominee, Harris has spoken at two more Black sorority events. Last week, at the Sigma Gamma Rho’s 60th International Biennial Boulé, that she addressed Trump’s comments earlier that day questioning her race. “When I look out at everyone here, I see family,” she said. The political power of Black Greek letter organisations is not lost on Harris. She is in many ways proof of their influence: when Biden endorsed Harris as his choice for vice-president in 2020, AKA members raised hundreds of thousands of dollars through individual donations of $19.08, an amount that refers to AKA’s founding year. They helped get out the vote among Black voters – famously organising the “Stroll to the Polls” campaign, in which sorority members filmed themselves dancing and walking to polling stations – a demographic that was crucial to getting Biden elected. Earlier this month, when Biden named Harris as his pick for nominee, the pan-Hellenic council released a statement saying it had “agreed to meet this critical moment in history with an unprecedented voter registration, education and mobilization coordinated campaign”. Together, the nine have four million members and a combined revenue of $150m, according to the New York Times. What sets historically Black Greek Letter organisations apart from others, says Lawrence Ross, the author of a book on the Divine Nine, and a member of Berkley University’s Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, is that it isn’t an experience limited to college. “We join alumni chapters. We continue to do the work of the fraternity or sorority. And it’s one of those things that becomes part of your identity”. “Black women have a networking ability that is pretty unmatched … What do we do most is voter education, voter registration”. A not-so-secret weapon AKA members have been vocal about their pride and excitement that one of their members could become the most powerful person on earth. (Officially, the way that AKA members express this emotion is through the trademarked call “skee-wee”). Because they are registered charity organisations, fraternities and sororities aren’t allowed to officially endorse specific political candidates, but they can – and do – mobilise among their members to get out the vote. Trump and the GOP “flatten Black people into two dimensions,” Ross said. “They don’t know really much about Black culture … It’s too late for them to understand what’s about to happen to them.” Black Greek letter organizations’ voter engagement programs “reach millions”, according to the New York Times. 93% of Black women who voted in 2020 voted Democrat, according an Associated Press poll. Black sororities have often been referred to as Harris’s “secret weapon”. But, Ross says, “It’s not a secret weapon to Black folks, right?” They are a key part of understanding who Harris is. Comparing Harris to Obama is often a mistake, the critic Vinson Cunningham, who worked on Obama’s campaign, said recently on a New Yorker podcast. But one thing they do have in common “is a Black father who is not from America”. For Obama, forming a Black identity that was distinctly American involved moving to Chicago, joining Trinity Church and sitting under the tutelage of Jeremiah Wright, Cunningham said. “You can think of the parallel motion in Kamala Harris’s life as: going to a [Historically Black College or University], joining perhaps the most famous historically Black sorority, the AKAs.” By making these choices, Obama and Harris were both, “tying themselves to a more distinctly American form of Blackness than the one that is signified by their fathers,” he said. Ross agrees. He compares it to the American chocolate boxes made by See’s Candy. “The best thing is the nuts and chews,” says Lawrence – and those are the ones Harris chose: as she deepened her Black identity, she chose the best candies in the box of American blackness to do so. “She went to Howard, which is the historically Black university. And she became an AKA where AKAs were founded.” “Howard is like a four-year immersion in everything. It’s like, you decide to go to the Disneyland of blackness. You know, so you got Soul Food Land, and so on,” he jokes. It also means that Harris understands the importance of historically Black Greek letter organisations within the Black community, he says. Asked what the role they have played in US history, Ross is unequivocal: “You would not have the civil rights movement without the Divine Nine members,” he says, and rattles off some of the movement’s most important figures: “Dorothy Height, a member of Delta Sigma Theta, Martin Luther King, Alpha Phi Alpha, Jesse Jackson, Omega Psi Phi.” Rosa Parks was an AKA member. Ralph Abernathy and Huey Newton were Black fraternity members, too. So how do Harris’s sorors remember her? Last week, Jill Louis, one of Harris’s AKA line sisters – women who were initiated in the same ceremony – told NPR’s I knew Her Then that Harris carried a briefcase. “She would not be alone, and it would not be deemed to be odd because we were about our business, the business of achieving that education and being able to move forward.” But she also ate lunch at a spot on campus called the Punchout: a sign that someone was cool. Back then, Harris was “much like what you see today,” Lorri L Sadler, another of her line sisters, told NBC Washington in 2021. “She was very cool, she was very calm, she was very collected, she was very mature.” “We’re non-partisan, but we are excited about the fact that she is the head of the ticket. It’s historic, and we’re gonna make sure that it remains historic. And it’s a very important election. It’s only democracy on the line,” says Ross.","summary":"Harris is a member of Alpha Kappa Alpha, the country’s oldest Black sorority and one of the Divine Nine, which boasts four million members\n\nOn 10 July, less than two weeks before Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race, Kamala Harris attended a boulé: the annual or biannual gathering of all of the members of a sorority.

After weeks of speculation, the vice president chose Minnesota Governor Tim Walz instead to join her on the Democratic presidential ticket. The move was met with praise from Democrats across the political spectrum but also brought allegations, largely from Republicans, that she bowed to pressure from the left not to pick Shapiro. ‘I thought it was going to be Shapiro, but we need him to stay here in Pennsylvania. We need him here,’ said Harris supporter Betty Blue from Philadelphia. It was a common response from Democrats DailyMail.com spoke to after the big reveal. ‘I kind of wanted him to, but I also didn’t want to lose him for Pennsylvania because he’s so good for Pennsylvania and Bucks County where I’m from, so almost a sigh of relief,’ said Carole Barocca from Yardley, PA. ‘It was a little bit of a safer choice, but it was probably a wise choice,’ said Lisa Schifflman of Wynnewood, PA of Harris picking Walz. ‘We need Governor Shapiro right here in Pennsylvania because there’s stuff happening here that he needs to keep his finger on,’ she added. ‘We get to keep Shapiro here,’ cheered Brenda Ross from Downingtown, PA. Marci Wilf from Wynnewood, PA said she was mixed about Shapiro not getting to join the ticket, but she thinks he could help Democrats in Pennsylvania either way. She also noted he has ‘a long road ahead of him to accomplish a lot of things.’ Amy Izzo from Exton, PA also liked the Walz pick. While she supports her home state governor, she pointed out Walz did not face the same challenges as Shapiro over Israel. When Shapiro’s name was floated as a potential running mate, it was met with excitement from some. Republicans saw him as a formidable threat in a key state. But he also started to receive criticism among progressives for his strong support of Israel. While his position on Israel is not out of line with other Democrats including those in leadership, other potential running mates did not face the same scrutiny as the Jewish governor leading to some accusations of anti-Semitism. When Harris went with Walz, Republicans seized on the decision and accused the vice president of caving to anti-Semites, but Democrats in the state that elected Shapiro dismissed that, and those with knowledge of the process said it came down to chemistry. Shapiro showed up for Harris and Walz in Philadelphia to thunderous applause Tuesday night and delivered a fiery speech where he vowed to work his tail off to get them elected in November. But under the national spotlight at the rally of more than 14,000 people, Shapiro also took a moment to address his faith. ‘Let me just say this. I lean on my family, and I lean on my faith, which calls me to serve, and I am proud of my faith,’ he declared. ‘I want to tell you what my faith teaches me. My faith teaches me that no one, no one is required to complete the task, but neither are we free to refrain from it.’ Shapiro also praised Harris as ‘battle tested and ready to go’ and called Walz a patriot and dear friend. ‘Are you ready to look the next President of the United States in the eye and say “hello Madam President.” I am too, so lets get to work,’ he finished to thunderous applause. ‘He’s going to make sure Pennsylvania does what they’re going to do,’ said Bertha Bellamy who was in the electric crowd for Shapiro’s speech. She said she would have liked to see a Jewish man on the ticket. ‘It’s okay. We’re going to ride with Walz.’ Forty minutes outside Philadelphia in Shapiro’s hometown, people are not surprised to see his rapid climb up the political ladder as speculation over the governor being picked amped up, but even in the Montgomery County suburbs where he launched his political career, voters were not sold on him being chosen for vice president. ‘I think he’s doing good things, and I think he will be good for Pennsylvania,’ said Margaret in Willow Grove just down the street from where Shapiro was raised. She thought it was ‘too soon’ for the less than one term governor to be seeking higher office. Others suggested it was too soon for him to leave the state for the national stage, but they very much still see it in his future. One woman said even if he had been asked, he should wait run for the ‘number one spot down the line.’ Arther Verbit lived directly across the street from Shapiro’s parents in Dresher, PA for years. While Verbit did not move in until Shapiro was an adult, he met the governor multiple times over the many years his parents still lived there. ‘He was doing a speech for a women’s group, and I said right then and there I was impressed and followed him ever since,’ he said, recounting an event roughly 20 years ago. ‘I said at that time, “this guy could be the first Jewish president.”‘ But even Verbit was not sure Shapiro was the right fit politically as Harris’ running mate this time around.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro is not heading to the White House any&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Reasons why Pennsylvania Democrats are happy that Kamala Harris chose Tim Walz over Josh Shapiro as her vice presidential candidate first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/politics/reasons-why-pennsylvania-democrats-are-happy-that-kamala-harris-chose-tim-walz-over-josh-shapiro-as-her-vice-presidential-candidate/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Why-Democrats-in-Pennsylvania-are-actually-relieved.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 23:22:23","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.008},{"id":253622954,"title":"NY Jewish leaders blast ‘ugly, antisemitic campaign’ against Josh Shapiro in veepstakes","text":"Jewish leaders in New York fumed that Josh Shapiro was “vilified” in an “ugly, antisemitic campaign” as Vice President Kamala Harris whittled down her veep contenders — ultimately passing over the Pennsylvania governor in favor of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz. Shapiro, who is Jewish, faced more scrutiny and criticism than other contenders because he’s pro-Israel, they claimed. “No one should dismiss that Gov. Shapiro was subjected to an ugly, antisemitic campaign to delegitimize him,” said Mark Treyger, CEO of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York and a former Brooklyn councilman. “No one should take the Jewish community’s vote for granted.” Treyger, the son of Ukrainian Jewish refugees and grandson of Holocaust survivors, said Shapiro was unfairly targeted because of his stance. “There was not much daylight between Josh Shapiro and the other contenders on policy. But he was singled out, he was vilified,” Treyger said. Maury Litwack, the founder and CEO of the Teach Coalition, a group that works with Jewish voters, noted, “You can be excited about the Walz pick but also be sad that an outright antisemitic campaign was waged against Shapiro.” Leftist Democrats and Israel critics labeled Shapiro “genocide Josh” for his support of Israel amid the war with Hamas in Gaza. The left-leaning magazine Jacobin even railed in a headline, “Josh Shapiro’s Palestine Record Should Disqualify Him as VP.” Rabbi Joseph Potasnik, executive vice president of the New York Board of Rabbis, said the chatter about Shapiro’s viability as a vice presidential candidate was “poor commentary.” “The fact that some people are talking about whether a proud Jewish, pro-Israel candidate can be on the ticket is very disheartening,” he said. The Harris campaign said her selection of Walz was not a knock on Shapiro and denied that his Jewish identity was a factor in the decision. Harris’ husband, Doug Emhoff, is Jewish. Rep. Dan Goldman (D-Manhattan/Brooklyn) slammed “the public antisemitic campaign from some within the Democratic Party” against Shapiro as “unacceptable and regrettable” — but was persuaded by Harris’ campaign that it did not influence her VP pick. Pro-Israel Republicans, including Jewish politicians, sought to turn Shapiro’s rejection into a campaign issue. “Antisemitism is un-American. Not picking Gov Shapiro because he is observant Jewish is wrong,” said Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, who is also Jewish. “If Harris’ boycott of Prime Minister Netanyahu’s address before Congress left doubts about Harris’ contempt for Jews and Israel, the dismissal of Governor Shapiro from Vice Presidential consideration should eviscerate those doubts. Shame on Kamala Harris for bending to the extreme anti-Semitic forces in her Party,” he said. But New York State Democratic Party chairman Jay Jacobs accused Republicans of engaging in “gutter politics.” “That the Vice President did not select a qualified, excellent Governor from the state of Pennsylvania, who is an observant Jew, but chose someone else who is not, does not justify the conclusion that it was BECAUSE of his religion,” said Jacobs, who is Jewish. “Does Donald Trump’s decision to skip over Tim Scott, a black Republican when selecting J.D. Vance as his VP nominee mean that Trump is a bigot or that he was ‘caving in’ to the growing bigotry in the Republican Party? Nonsense!”","summary":"Shapiro, who is Jewish, faced more scrutiny and criticism than other contenders because he's pro-Israel, they claimed.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/07/us-news/ny-jewish-leaders-say-josh-shapiro-was-vilified-in-veepstakes/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/87280800.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/F01ZpC15-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-07 23:22:13","author":"Carl Campanile","authors":["Carl Campanile"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.476},{"id":253622920,"title":"Sen.

But in 2020, President Biden won back all three states with razor-thin margins as he defeated Trump, and the states remain extremely competitive as Harris and Trump face off in the 2024 presidential election. So it was no surprise that Harris held her first rally with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz - her newly named running mate - in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, with stops Wednesday in Wisconsin and Michigan. And staying in close proximity was Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. KAMALA HARRIS AND HER NEWLY NAMED RUNNING MATE KICK OFF A BATTLEGROUND STATE SWING Walz took aim at Trump at Wednesday afternoon's rally, charging that the former President \"sees the world differently than we see it. He has no understanding of service. Because he's too busy serving himself again and again and again.\" \"This guy weakens our country to strengthen his own hands. He mocks our laws. He sows chaos and division amongst the people. And that's to say nothing of the job he did as president,\" Walz argued. Hours earlier, Trump – in an interview on \"Fox and Friends\" – belittled the naming to the Democrats' ticket of Walz, a former high school teacher and football coach turned Democratic congressman in a red district before winning election and re-election as governor. VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS NAMES MINNESOTA GOV TIM WALZ AS HER RUNNING MATE \"I could not be more thrilled,\" Trump said when asked about the announcement from Harris on Tuesday that she chose Walz as her running mate, after also seriously considering Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona. \"I was shocked when, when it came down to the final two, that she didn't pick Shapiro. I was very surprised,\" Trump said. But the naming of a running mate has been lucrative for the Harris campaign, which highlighted that it had hauled in $36 million in fundraising in the 24 hours since the Walz announcement. At the rally, which the Harris campaign said attracted a crowd of over 12,000 people to a festival field amid farmland outside this small northwest Wisconsin city, Walz once again argued that Trump and Vance \"are creepy and weird as hell.\" Vance, at a campaign event miles away, pushed back on the \"weird\" label, saying that he and Trump are \"normal guys who want to make this country great.\" In a viral moment, Vance appeared to try and troll the vice president, as he approached Air Force Two at Chippewa Valley Regional Airport, where the senator's campaign plane was also parked. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"I figured that I would come by and get a good look at the plane because hopefully it’s going to be my plane in a few months,\" Vance said in front of Air Force Two. And once again pointing out that Harris has yet to sit for a major interview or hold a press conference in the two and a half weeks since she replaced President Biden at the top of the Democrats' national ticket, Vance told reporters \"I also thought you guys may get lonely, because the VP doesn’t answer questions from reporters.\" Biden dropped his re-election bid on July 21, after a disastrous debate performance against Trump in late June prompted increased questions over whether the 81-year-old president had the physical and mental abilities to serve another four years in the White House. It also sparked a rising chorus of calls from fellow Democrats for Biden to end his re-election bid. Harris didn't mention her boss at a large rally in Atlanta last week, nor did she or Walz reference the president at their rally Tuesday night in Philadelphia. But Harris, in her sixth visit to Wisconsin so far this year, praised the president at the top of her comments. \"I want to bring greetings from our incredible president, Joe Biden,\" Harris said. \"He loves Wisconsin, and I know we are all deeply grateful for his lifetime of service to our nation and for all he continues to do.\" After the crowd broke out in a chant of \"Thank you, Joe! Thank you, Joe!,\" the vice president responded \"that's right. I’m gonna tell him what you said.\" Get the latest updates from the 2024 campaign trail, exclusive interviews and more at our Fox News Digital election hub.","summary":"Kamala Harris and Tim Walz hold a large rally in battleground Wisconsin at the same time that Trump running mate JD held a dueling event just miles away","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-walz-trade-fire-trump-running-mate-vance-dueling-events-blue-wall-states-battle","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/08/931/523/Kamala-Harris-Tim-Walz-Eau-Claire-WI-August-7-2024-scaled.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 23:16:36","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.271},{"id":253622688,"title":"in 2020, Trump ‘fully’ agreed with Walz’s handling of Floyd protests","text":"By Alayna Treene, Michael Williams and Kristen Holmes | CNN (CNN) — Republicans are attacking Tim Walz’s response to unrest in Minneapolis in 2020, but at the time, then-President Donald Trump said he “fully” agreed with how the Minnesota governor handled rioting in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, undercutting a key line of GOP attack this week after Walz was named Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 running mate. “I fully agree with the way he handled it the last couple of days,” Trump said of Walz on a June 1, 2020, call during which he also described the Democratic governor as “an excellent guy.” The call was led by Trump, who was joined by then-Attorney General Bill Barr, then-Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley and then-Defense Secretary Mark Esper, and included a series of governors as protests across the country, some of which devolved into violent rioting, were breaking out following the police killing of Floyd on May 25. Details from the call, during which Trump implored governors across the country to “dominate” protesters, have previously been reported, and CNN published the call’s full transcript the day it happened in 2020. It’s not uncommon for even the most bitter of political rivals to offer tempered praise toward one another in the aftermath of a natural disaster or serious nationwide crisis – especially ones that require cooperation in responses between state and federal governments. But more than four years later, Trump’s praise for Walz takes on new meaning as the GOP nominee and his allies have sought to jolt Americans’ memories of the nationwide unrest that summer, linking Walz to pictures of Minneapolis engulfed in flames and the aftermath of the destruction. “You’ve got a big National Guard out there that’s ready to come in and fight like hell. I tell you, what they did in Minneapolis was incredible. They went in and dominated. And it happened immediately,” Trump told the governors. “Tim Walz. Again, I was very happy with the last couple of days. Tim, you called up big numbers and the big numbers knocked them out so fast it was like bowling pins.” The call took place a week after Floyd was killed. At the time, and in the years since, Republicans publicly criticized Walz over whether he waited too long to call in Minnesota’s National Guard. Trump’s 2024 campaign, responding to CNN’s request about his 2020 praise for Walz and the details of the call, said that he was only complimentary of the Minnesota governor given that by June 1, Walz “had acted.” They argued, however, that Trump had always been frustrated that Walz hadn’t taken more action sooner. Walz first activated the Guard on May 28, three days after Floyd was killed, and the same day protesters lit the outside of the Minneapolis Police Department’s Third Precinct on fire. “The important thing here is the timing and context for these remarks. He was complimenting a governor that finally, after days of madness, had finally done something. So it wasn’t in real time. It was after Walz finally did something about it,” a senior Trump campaign adviser told CNN. A second Trump adviser reiterated the point, telling CNN the call came “in the context of what President Trump encouraged a lot of these governors and local leaders to do, in finally stopping or doing something about these riots. It had been seven days, or however long, days that Minneapolis had been burning, where President Trump, is essentially saying, finally, you guys, finally, the burning and looting and rioting have stopped.” Allies close to Trump echoed the adviser’s sentiment, noting the panic among government officials at the time on how to curb the riots, and the urgency to reach across the aisle to stop the violence. During the 2020 call, Walz also offered some words of thanks for the Trump administration’s response, thanking Esper for his “strategic guidance.” He also asked the Trump administration to help with messaging surrounding the role of National Guard troops. But in the hours after Walz was announced as Democrats’ vice presidential candidate on Monday, Republicans attacked his tenure as governor — with much of the criticism focused on the timing of his decision to call in his state’s National Guard. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, told reporters earlier this week that Walz “allowed rioters to burn down Minneapolis in the summer of 2020.” Walz “sat by and let Minneapolis burn,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis wrote on X. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott echoed that accusation. Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton said Walz “could have stopped” the rioting, “if he wanted to,” while the Republican Party’s research arm accused Walz of fleeing “like a coward” while Minneapolis burned. A spokesperson for Cotton’s Senate campaign said Walz “should have immediately sent in the Guard, the state police, and restored order instead of letting violent criminals destroy a huge portion of the city, before they were bailed out of jail by Kamala Harris,” alluding to a tweet Harris posted in support of a Minnesota bail fund. “As Tim Walz has admitted, his handling of the riots was an ‘abject failure,’” Cotton’s spokesperson said, referencing remarks the governor made about the city’s response to the riots. Spokespeople for Abbott and DeSantis did not immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday afternoon. Even before Harris selected Walz, Trump criticized the governor on the subject. “Every voter in Minnesota needs to know that when the violent mobs of anarchists and looters and Marxists came to burn down Minneapolis four years ago … Remember me? I couldn’t get your governor to act,” Trump told the crowd at his rally in St. Cloud, Minnesota, last month, before falsely claiming that he, not Walz, activated the National Guard in response to the unrest. “I sent in the National Guard to save Minneapolis, while Kamala Harris sided with the arsonist and rioters and raised money to bail out the criminals,” Trump said. Walz, who first activated the Guard after peaceful protests had devolved into instances of rioting, looting and violence, said in 2020 he did so in response to requests from the mayors of Minneapolis and St. Paul. During the June 2020 call, Trump said he had directed Walz to call in the National Guard, before lauding the way the officers performed. “I said you gotta use the National Guard,” Trump said, referring to Minneapolis. “They didn’t at first, then they did, and I’ll tell you that’s true, I don’t know what it was … those guys, third night, fourth night, they walked through that stuff like it was butter. They walked right through and you haven’t had any problems since.” The governor faced some bipartisan criticism for the timing of his order to activate the Guard. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, a Democrat who was facing scrutiny over chaos in his city, said in August 2020 that he had verbally asked Walz on the evening of May 27 to send in the Guard but that the governor hesitated. Walz refuted Frey’s account at the time, saying the ask did not constitute an official request, which he said came the next day. (Any tension between the two seems to have cooled.) Some of the most notable instances of violence in Minneapolis, including the ransacking and burning of a city police precinct, took place the night of May 28 – after Walz had already activated a portion of the Guard. Walz and Trump spoke the same day. The governor activated the entire guard on May 30. In the June 1 call with Walz and the other governors, Trump seemed to acknowledge that he was satisfied with how the state Guard responded to the protests: “Yesterday and the day before, compared to the first few days, was just – never seen anything like it,” Trump said. Walz responded: “Absolutely.” Trump said he believed that was a good idea, though he added he thought “that the people wouldn’t have minded an occupying force.” “I wish they had an occupying force in there,” Trump added. Later that day, federal law enforcement would forcibly clear peaceful protesters from a park outside the White House, making way for Trump to cross the park and pose for a photo op with a Bible outside St. John’s Church.","summary":"“I fully agree with the way he handled it the last couple of days,” Trump said of Walz on a June 1, 2020, call during which he also described the Democratic governor as “an excellent guy.”","url":"https://www.mercurynews.com/2024/08/07/in-2020-trump-fully-agreed-with-walzs-handling-of-floyd-protests/","image":"https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/sjm-6231891.jpg?w=1024","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 23:13:28","author":"Cnn.com Wire Service","authors":["Cnn.com Wire Service"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.136},{"id":253625814,"title":"Rapper Nelly is arrested for suspected drug possession at St. Louis-area casino","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Two Flair passengers in B.C. were told a bird strike cancelled their flight.

Out of the 1,618 adults surveyed, 38 percent said they believed Trump would be victorious.While a small margin, it is the first time since October 2023 that Americans have indicated in an Economist/YouGov poll that they think Trump will lose his reelection bid to either Harris or President Joe Biden, who dropped out of the race as the Democratic nominee on July 21. In the survey released last week, Trump was predicted to win over Harris 42 percent to 35 percent.Harris' boosted chances of winning the election may be due to the increased enthusiasm among Democrats since she entered the race. This week, 60 percent of Democratic voters said they were \"very or extremely enthusiastic about voting\" in November, while 58 Republicans said the same.That number is a 2-point boost for Democrats compared to last week's Economist/YouGov polling, where 58 percent said they were feeling enthusiastic. Meanwhile, Republican's excitement dropped by 9 points--the poll conducted between July 27 and 30 found that 67 percent of GOP voters were feeling \"very or extremely enthusiastic\" for this fall.According to a report on Wednesday's polling, this is the first time that Democrats have been more excited about the election than Republicans since the Economist/YouGov began asking the question in March 2024.Newsweek reached out to Harris and Trump's campaigns via email for comment.Polling has shown that Harris and her recently-appointed running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, have closed the gap to Trump in just a little over two weeks since entering the 2024 race. As of Monday, Harris was leading in all major polling averages, including those compiled by RealClearPolitics, The Economist, and FiveThirtyEight.The race, however, is still incredibly close. In RealClearPolitics' report, Harris was leading Trump by just 0.2 percent. The vice president's biggest lead on average was calculated by FiveThirtyEight, which said that Harris is now 2 percentage points above Trump on average across national polling.Harris told her supporters at a rally in Philadelphia on Tuesday that her campaign is \"the underdog\" in the race but that she was ready to fight until the election.\"We have a fight ahead of us, and we are the underdogs in the race,\" she said at an event at Temple University, where she introduced Walz for the first time as her running mate. \"But this is a people-powered campaign, and we have momentum.\"","summary":"In a recent Economist/YouGov poll, more Americans predicted Harris to win in November over former President Donald Trump.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/kamala-harris-new-lead-2024-winner-poll-1936215","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2445537/kamalaharris-takes-new-lead-likely-2024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 23:06:53","author":"Kaitlin Lewis","authors":["Kaitlin Lewis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":253621996,"title":"Mugshot of Kamala Harris’ VP running mate surfaces from drink driving arrest","text":"Minnesota Governor Tim Walz’s mugshot (right) emerged after Vice President Kamala Harris (left) picked him as her running mate (Pictures: Rex) As Democratic nominee Kamala Harris’ newly picked running mate makes national headlines, a dishonorable photo from his past has emerged. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz’s mugshot from a 1995 arrest on suspicion of drink driving surfaced shortly after Harris selected him to be her vice presidential partner on the Democratic ticket. Walz’s booking photo obtained by Fox News shows him staring seemingly dazed at the camera while holding a Dawes County Sheriff’s Department placard in Nebraska. He was arrested on September 23, 1995, after driving over 80mph in a 55mph zone. The at the time 28-year-old failed a breath test with a .128 blood alcohol concentration. Walz also failed a sobriety test. Walz was booked into a county jail then released on bond. Walz reached a plea deal in which he admitted to a reduced charge of reckless driving and paid a $200 fine. The now 60-year-old reportedly does not drink alcohol anymore. Harris’ announcement on Tuesday of Walz as her running mate spurred much digging into his past. Who is Tim Walz? Walz is a Nebraska native who served as a National Guardsman. He was worked as a high school teacher and football coach at the time of his arrest on suspicion of DUI. Walz was elected to the House of Representative and from there won the Minnesota governorship in 2018. He was elected as governor in 2022. What have Donald Trump and his running mate JD Vance said about Tim Walz? Ex-President Donald Trump’s running mate JD Vance, who himself has faced scrutiny of his past since being picked, on Wednesday tried to confront Walz and Harris on a Wisconsin tarmac as their aircrafts arrived at similar times.

Tim Walz to be her running mate. Following the announcement, a viral Facebook post claimed that now that Walz is running for vice president, he’s no longer governor of Minnesota and the position has been filled by his lieutenant governor, Peggy Flanagan. Other people online questioned if Walz has to step down as governor now that he’s on Harris’ presidential ticket. Did Tim Walz step down as Minnesota’s governor so he could run for vice president? No, Tim Walz didn’t step down as Minnesota’s governor so he could run for vice president. Tim Walz is still the governor of Minnesota and Peggy Flanagan is still the lieutenant governor. The Facebook post saying Walz had to step down because he is running for vice president is false. Minnesota doesn’t have any laws, known as resign-to-run laws, which require elected officials to leave their current elected position before running for a different elected position. That means Walz is still governor while running for vice president. But Walz will have to resign if he and Harris win the election in November. He would have to resign from the position before inauguration day, Jan. 20, 2025. If Harris and Walz are elected, Section 4.06(a) of Minnesota Statute says “when a vacancy occurs, from any cause whatever, in the office of governor, the lieutenant governor shall become governor and the last duly elected president of the senate shall become lieutenant governor for the remainder of the term.” That means if he gets elected vice president, Minnesota Lt. Gov. Peggy Flanagan would take his seat until Jan. 4, 2027, when Walz’s term expires. Flanagan would become the first woman to hold the office in Minnesota history and the first Native American to serve as governor for any state. If Harris and Walz lose, Walz will remain Minnesota’s governor until his term expires. There are only five states – Florida, Georgia, Arizona, Texas and Hawaii – that have rules known as resign-to-run laws although they vary by state. Supporters of resign-to-run laws say campaigning while holding an elected office could lead to various problems, including neglect of official duties. In Florida, an elected official doesn’t have to resign office if they are running for president or vice president, but would have to resign if they ran for any other seat, like the Senate. Georgia’s state constitution says anyone in office must resign from office in order to be qualified to be a candidate for any other elected state, county, or municipal office or in the House and Senate. Hawaii’s constitution and State Legislature say an elected official could not run for any other public office if they would take office before their current term ends. The Texas State Constitution says in any general, special or primary election, an elected official would have to resign before running for another office, but it only applies to certain local offices. The governor is not on this list, so a sitting governor in Texas could run for vice president or president without resigning. Arizona’s law says elected officials have to resign from office if they have filed formal paperwork announcing their intention to run for another local, state or federal office and are also not in the final year of their term.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nSome states require elected officials to resign before running for another office.&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Debunking the Claim that Tim Walz is No Longer Minnesota&#8217;s Governor first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/debunking-the-claim-that-tim-walz-is-no-longer-minnesotas-governor/","image":"https://www.wkyc.com/assets/shared-images/icons/verify/badge-false.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 22:55:08","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.424},{"id":253623746,"title":"Kamala Harris's Latest Free Concert: Bon Iver Performs at Wisconsin Rally","text":"In a bid to lure swing-state voters to her rallies, Kamala Harris is relying on pop stars to do her heavy lifting for her, enlisting them to perform free concerts that will act as crowd magnets to create the illusion of a grassroots political movement. Last week in Georgia, it was “Wet Ass Pussy” rapper Megan Thee Stallion, who delivered a reliably raunchy performance. This week it’s the Grammy-winning indie band Bon Iver, which appeared Wednesday at a Kamala rally in the group’s hometown of Eau Claire, Wisconsin.

With Kamala now abruptly installed as the party elite’s chosen favorite without having garnered a single primary vote, a new poll shows Trump virtually tied — thanks in large part to the establishment news media’s boosterism of everything Kamala. The battle over Wisconsin led to an embarrassing moment for Kamala earlier this week. On Tuesday, GOP Vice Presidential candidate JD Vance approached Air Force Two, which Harris was onboard, in a tense standoff during which the current and perhaps future vice president occupied the same Wisconsin runway. “I thought the reporters traveling with Kamala might be a little lonely given that she never answers questions from them, so I figured I’d come say hello and check out my new plane while I was at it,” Vance later wrote on social media.","summary":"In a bid to lure swing-state voters to her rallies, Kamala Harris is relying on pop stars to do her heavy lifting for her, enlisting them to perform free concerts that will act as crowd magnets to create the illusion of a grassroots political movement.\n\n\nThe post Kamala Harris&#8217;s Latest Free Concert: Bon Iver Performs at Wisconsin Rally appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2024/08/07/kamala-harriss-latest-free-concert-bon-iver-performs-at-wisconsin-rally/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/bonnier-640x335.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 22:52:01","author":"David Ng","authors":["David Ng"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.002},{"id":253622496,"title":"‘Folksy’ Tim Walz has a radical record — but fakery is what the ticket is all about","text":"With the selection of Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as Kamala Harris’ running mate, the United States now has the most radical, most extreme, most socialist ticket in this country’s history.The selection shocked almost everybody, including those on the left. The slam-dunk veep choice was obviously Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, a relative moderate who holds an approval rating north of 60% in his most crucial of swing states.But instead of moving her party more to the center, Harris went with her soulmate in Walz. Walz doesn’t deliver a swing state (Minnesota hasn’t gone red since 1972), and his record shows he’s basically Bernie Sanders or AOC with a “Fargo” accent. But right on cue, our activist media — after debasing itself beyond recognition by pushing outright lies about Joe Biden’s health and about Harris’ policies and record — have cheered the selection of Walz while comically attempting to portray him as a moderate.“I grew up in a small town,” Walz said last month as he ramped up his bid to be named to the Democrats’ ticket. “JD Vance is dead wrong about what makes small-town America tick,” the governor said of former President Donald Trump’s running mate. “Small towns don’t work because everyone is closed-minded and prejudiced. They work because people mind their own damn business. JD Vance seems to have a real problem minding his.” Follow The Post’s coverage on Kamala Harris’ running mate Tim Walz: Kamala Harris chooses Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate Who is Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ VP pick? Tim Walz signed laws catering to illegal migrants, giving them free healthcare, tuition Trump team says it’s relieved Kamala Harris chose ‘extremist’ Tim Walz: ‘An easy opponent’ Editorial: Kamala Harris bows to the radicals by picking lefty Tim Walz as her running mate “Mind their own damn business”? Walz actually created a COVID snitch hotline at the height of the pandemic, encouraging neighbors to rat each other out for breaking his extreme protocols. The hotline endured through 2022. That’s small-town values for you! “When somebody tells who they are, they — believe them,” Walz said Tuesday as he introduced himself to America in a folksy yet substance-free announcement speech. “[Trump] said he would ban abortion across this country, and he’ll do it whether or not Congress is there or not.” That’s just 100% false. Trump supports states’ rights on the issue, after the Dobbs ruling correctly left decisions about abortion up to the voters, not to the federal government. “I worked across the aisle on veterans issues, on agriculture and on ways to grow rural economies,” Walz claimed Tuesday about his legislative record. “I learned the art of compromise without compromising my values.” But as governor, he used a one-vote state Senate majority to force through a host of far-left policies. And media spin aside, do these sound like moderate positions? Walz supports sex changes for minors without parental permission.He’s for open borders and illegal crossings — and even told CNN in 2019 that he wanted to invest in a “ladder company” to help illegal migrants get over Trump’s border wall.He supports sanctuary cities. And a carbon-free electrical grid by 2040 for Minnesota, which has some of the coldest weather in the country. He installed tampon machines in boys’ school bathrooms. Supports free health care and free college for illegal immigrants and drivers’ licenses to boot. Supported a mandatory mask mandate in Minnesota. And of course he presided over the state during its 2020 riots, which resulted in $500 million in damage in Minneapolis, including the torching of a police precinct. Walz refused for days to quell the violence by bringing in the National Guard, then apologized when he finally pulled the trigger. But now the Harris-Walz campaign wants the country to believe that this team is riding squarely down the center lane. It’s the ultimate cheap fake marinated in spin and vibes and lies — all scripted and loaded into a Teleprompter.This pair, which has not received a single primary vote in a national contest, can get away with this, at least for now — because many in the media simply want Trump defeated, no matter what their advocacy journalism does to their irreparably broken profession.In the nearly three weeks since Harris became the Democratic nominee, she has yet to take one question on any matter of policy or substance. The same will undoubtedly be true for Walz.In the end, only a series of presidential debates will truly provide the American people with the contrast and choice that they are facing, and what is by far the most consequential election of our lifetimes. Whether those debates happen is another story, because Harris and Walz would love nothing more than to plead the Fifth all the way to November 5th.Kamala Harris and Tim Walz may be the slight favorites right now. But if this ticket somehow wins, know this: You won’t even recognize this country anymore.

I know the US election maybe isn’t at the top of your list of stuff to worry about right now. But it’s deadly important. Not just for the Yanks, but for us too. And the polls right now are shifting fairly firmly in favour of the former Vice President Kamala Harris, who is denser than a sack of spanners. And her running mate — the even worse Tim “Wokey Wokey” Walz. Just a month or so ago Donald Trump looked as if he were going to cruise to victory against a senile sitting President, Joe Biden. Now, I know that in normal times that might not be something to celebrate. But boorish as Trump may be, his tenure as President was a damn sight better than anything we’ve seen from the almost dead Biden. During that time, Trump was leading in the polls, especially in the important swing states that often determine the outcome of American elections. There was a rather aggressive move by the Democrats to remove Joe Biden from his position. Some senior members of the Democratic party threatened Joe with the need to resign. They even went as far as to joke about taking away his catheter and beloved Werther’s Originals. As a result of this pressure, Biden stepped down and Kamala Harris, who many consider as an ineffective vice president chosen to please the more progressive members of the party, was sworn in as his replacement. And the bad news keeps on coming. Because now Kamala has chosen a running mate who seems to me even dimmer than she is. And even further to the left. Walz is the governor of Minnesota, which has always been a fairly left-wing state. But even the lefties are sick of him there. He was a disaster as governor. Crime has soared under his watch — not least because he takes the left-wing line that we should probably abolish the police completely and let everybody police themselves. That’s the policy which has turned all of America’s liberal cities into crime-ridden hellholes. Turns out that if you defund the police, the local crims don’t turn into saints and stop nicking stuff. They do it all the more. Anyway, folks are getting the hell out of Minnesota at a remarkable rate. Largely because of the appalling crime rate. All this in what was once one of the USA’s safer states to live in. Hostile to our interests Student achievement has also dropped alarmingly. Some say this is the consequence of “progressive” policies to increase ethnic diversity and so on. You can expect all that dangerous rubbish to be on the agenda for the Harris-Walz presidency. Every bit of right-on rubbish that has plagued the country for two decades. If that was the sum total of the problems, we could just leave the Yanks to get on with it. Sadly, though, it isn’t. The problem for us is that a Harris-Walz presidency would be hostile to our interests. Democrat presidents usually are — even the half decent ones like JF Kennedy. And the further left they are, the more hostile to the UK they become. The last thing we want in the White House is an administration which will give us trouble over trade, defence and international relations generally. So, if you have a minute to spare, offer a small prayer that the Americans wake up soon. And send Walz back to Minnesota to cause more damage there. Board of Paris olympics THE only time I’ve really been interested in the Olympics was very briefly in 1972. It was the men’s basketball final. Between the red-hot favourites, the USA. And a country who were not at that time their closest friends, the USSR. I think it must be the only time a basketball match made nuclear war more likely. The Russkies won by one point with the last throw of the game. And there was uproar – it was almost certainly a fix by the commies. Anyway, I wish we could have something like that in these games. The only other time I get excited is looking at the medal table. I like to see Britain in third place at worst, behind the USA and China. This time it will be enough for me if we beat the French, though. I don’t even care about the Aussies, for a change. Just beat the French, on their own ground. With their worm-infested food and poo-infested river. Horror holiday THE Government is drawing up plans to evacuate 16,000 Brits from Lebanon. The country looks like it might soon be at war with Israel. But even when it’s not at war with Israel, it’s hardly the safest place in the world, is it? What are the Brits doing there? Are they on some sort of special package deal holiday? “We’re sick of being hated by the Spanish, so our travel agent found a lovely little hotel. “It’s called The Hezbollah Jihadi Palms and it’s in a place called Beirut. “We can’t wait!” Lots at steak HERE’S a heart-warming story. A vet called Polly Dugmore rescued a whole herd of calves which were in danger of drowning. The animals had wandered on to a beach in Cornwall. And were trapped by the incoming tide. Bit of a mixed blessing for the calves, mind. Because these were Wagyu beef calves, prized for their succulent flavour. So probably a case of: “OK you calves. You’re all safe. Now, if you wouldn’t mind climbing up that ramp into the lorry, please. One at a time, chop chop. So to speak.” lI JUST read that some 5,700 kids are waiting for transgender care treatment in the UK.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Brian Marks For Dailymail.com Published:23:28 BST, 7 August 2024 |Updated:23:43 BST, 7 August 2024 e-mail 10 shares 2 View comments Pamela Anderson is revealing how her now-adult sons were exposed to uncomfortable aspects of her wild life in a new interview. The 57-year-old Baywatch star shared in her new Better Homes & Gardens' Stylemaker Issue cover story that her sons Brandon Thomas Lee and Dylan Jagger Lee — whom she shares with her ex-husband Tommy Lee — learned a mix of family friendly and 'not age-appropriate' details about her exploits as they were growing up. However, she admitted she wasn't as concerned about the public oversharing now, as Brandon, 27, and Dylan, 26, are both mature enough to 'understand the big picture.' The Stylemaker Issue featuring Pamela Anderson hits newsstands on Friday, August 23 and the cover story is available online here. As children, the boys learned of their mother's infamous sex tape with their rocker father, which was stolen and then distributed without her consent. Although she and Tommy eventually won multiple lawsuits related to the distribution of the tape, she has claimed that she never saw a dime from its massive sales. Pamela Anderson is revealing how her now-adult sons Brandon Thomas Lee (L) and Dylan Jagger Lee (R) were exposed to uncomfortable aspects of her wild life in a new Better Homes & Gardens cover story; pictured in September in NYC The 57-year-old Baywatch star said Brandon, 27, and Dylan, 26, learned a mix of family friendly and 'not age-appropriate' details about her exploits as they were growing up; seen in a publicity still for Baywatch Pamela spoke about how her sons reacted to the more risqué details of her life after the interviewer noted the family's closeness. Brandon would have also learned particularly intimate details about his mother after serving as a producer on her Netflix documentary Pamela, A Love Story, which was released in 2023. 'My kids are old enough now to understand the big picture,' the actress stated. 'They look at me and say, \"Mom, this is your time.\" 'Of course, over the years, as they learned about things in my past, both age-appropriate and not age-appropriate, unfortunately, they thought I was taken advantage of in some ways,' she admitted. But that conclusion only prompted Brandon and Dylan to support her more. 'They told me, “Whatever you’ve created by being you, just keep being you. We’re going to try and find ways for you to keep doing what you love but also sharing it with people in a way where it benefits you too. You can create a life. You can keep writing. You can keep doing all the things you love,\"' she recalled them saying. The iconic blonde also praised her sons as 'young, bold, hardworking men.' 'They’re ambitious, they’re talented, they’re creative, they’re gentlemen, and they’re good cooks,' she gushed lovingly. Anderson's interview was timed to promote her upcoming cookbook, I Love You, which will hit shelves in October. She admitted that the project was initially much more intimate, as she began working on the recipes as a 'housewarming gift' for Brandon and Dylan, who had gone in together on buying a house that they would live in with their girlfriends. Pamela shared glimpses of her home in Canada and her newfound love for garden in Better Homes & Gardens' Stylemaker Issues, on newstands Friday, August 23 Although Pam worried about her kids learning about her X-rated exploits, she said they were 'old enough now to understand the big picture,' the actress stated 'I remember my mom used to have these recipe cards in a box. I decided I had to find the ultimate recipe card box,' she recalled. Although she focused on recipes that had been passed down with her family, she gave them some modern, healthy updates by making the 'North and Eastern European' foods 'plant-based.' 'These are things I love; these are my comfort foods,' she added enthusiastically. However, her business-minded son Brandon realized that she had enough material to make a publishable book, and the renewed public interest in her life coinciding with the release of her documentary, memoir and the miniseries Pam & Tommy — which Anderson was not involved with and has publicly derided — made it seem like a logical next step. She explained that the unusual title, I Love You, was arrived at because she had 'engraved' the words on the box of recipes that she presented to her sons. While speaking about her sons, she shared that she encourages them to think of the 'challenges' they encounter as 'the poetry of your life.' 'You wouldn’t know hot if you didn’t know cold. You wouldn’t have appreciation for the good times without going through the hard times. It’s all a roller coaster,' she said. Elsewhere in her interview, Pamela spoke about her cooking exploits, including her unusually named sourdough starter, which she dubbed 'Vixen.' She revealed that she developed an interest in baking as a form of 'meditation.' The interest in baking seemed to be one of Pamela's changes instituted after she moved back from the US to her native Canada (though she gained naturalized US citizenship in 2004). The Barb Wire actress admitted she was 'not in a good place' when she moved back north. Brandon (pictured in March in West Hollywood) and Dylan both supported their mother and tried to find ways for her to monetize her life to make up for ways they thought she had been 'exploited' The actress shared in her cover story that her new cookbook, titled I Love You, originated as a box of recipes for her sons after they bought a house together to live in with their girlfriends; pictured May 6 at the Met Gala in Manhattan She admitted to feeling 'very sad and lonely,' and she felt like a completely different person than the image of herself that was known to the public. She was also dealing with overwhelming regrets after feeling as if she had 'really screwed up' and lived a life that was little more than a 'bundle of mistakes.' But things started to look up after she moved to Canada and discovered a hidden passion for gardening. Pamela said she came to think of her time in the garden as a 'metaphor of putting my life back together,' and she found the process of coaxing new life out of the soil to be 'really profound.'

Tim Walz’s fingerprints are all over the deadly riots that consumed Minneapolis and St. Paul in the summer of 2020 — their cheerleading and inaction giving cover to criminals as neighborhoods burned and hundreds of businesses were ransacked and destroyed. In the wake of the murder of George Floyd, lawlessness reigned as city streets erupted in a nightmarish hellscape of violence and flames. “The civil unrest that happened in Minnesota was unprecedented, it was a once-in-100-years thing. Nobody expected it, nobody planned for it,” Dr. Ali Barbarawi, a Minneapolis dentist who grew up in the West Bank, told The Post. Crime skyrocketed – with murders jumping 75% in 2020 compared to the prior year, and then rising even more 2021. Killings have dropped, but are still 50% above 2019 levels. Many of the businesses that were damaged were small, family-run operations, and Barbarawi — whose office was destroyed in the riots — said owners hoped they would one day be made whole after order was restored. “People were expecting a lot more help from the government on a larger scale. It was a disaster and when disaster happens, people expect help from either the city, state or federal government,” he said. “That didn’t happen much. There were some state-level grants but not for everybody, and not at a level business owners were expecting.” During the riots, some business owners took desperate measures to keep their livelihoods safe from the raging masses, many described waiting for help that would never arrive. Follow The Post’s coverage on Kamala Harris’ running mate Tim Walz: Kamala Harris chooses Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as running mate Who is Tim Walz, Kamala Harris’ VP pick? Tim Walz signed laws catering to illegal migrants, giving them free healthcare, tuition Trump team says it’s relieved Kamala Harris chose ‘extremist’ Tim Walz: ‘An easy opponent’ Editorial: Kamala Harris bows to the radicals by picking lefty Tim Walz as her running mate As his state’s largest city was engulfed in flames, Walz held off on mobilizing the Minnesota National Guard for a full 18 hours after Minnesota Mayor Jacob Frey said he desperately needed at least 600 National Guardsmen to bring things under control. When Walz finally decided to act the night of May 28, 2020, he sent only 100 guardsmen, a scathing post-mortem from the state’s Senate revealed later that year. Those that did arrive did little to stop the carnage, according to Minneapolis residents. Ricardo Hernandez, 44, owner of La Michoacana Purepecha ice cream shop at 701 East Lake Street, pleaded with the National Guardsmen to intervene as rioters doused the businesses next door with gasoline. When they refused, he said he had to negotiate with the demonstrators himself. “Walz should have had the National Guard out there sooner before the damage was done,” Hernandez said. “He told the National Guard to stand still.” To avoid the same fate for his own shop, he stayed there so he could stand guard. “If I wasn’t there, my business would have been burned down.” David Hann, the chairman of the Minnesota Republican Party, told The Post he believes Walz was reluctant to act during the Black Lives Matter protests because he didn’t want to betray left-wing progressives. “I think as governor of the state and relying on that progressive base, he knows that that’s where the political power is, in the Democratic Party. So he can’t… abandon that without risk of hurting his status as a political leader,” he said. “The city has still not recovered.” Equally troubling, the governor — who took office in 2019 — was also accused of sharing confidential information with his teenage daughter, including law enforcement plans and National Guard response times. “The guard can not be sent in within minutes,” Hope Walz, who was 19 at the time, tweeted earlier in the evening on May 28, 2020, noting that, “it takes time for them to deploy because they come from all over the state.” She later unambiguously added, “To be clear, the national guard will not be present tonight.” Back at the stately governor’s residence in St. Paul, Walz’s wife Gwen recounted throwing open the windows to catch deep whiffs of the destruction in the city. “I could smell the burning tires, and that was a very real thing,” she recalled in a sit-down interview with KTSP in June 2020. “I kept the windows open as long as I could because I felt like that was such a touchstone of what was happening,” she added. Meanwhile, Vice President Harris was fanning the flames through social media, encouraging followers to donate to the Minnesota Freedom Fund (MFF) “to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota” in a June 1, 2020 post. And donate they did, to the tune of some $35 million by June 15. But the MFF, which claims on its website to be a champion of the downtrodden and indigent, has also spent hundreds of thousands bailing out violent criminals, according to local reports. “I worry about the victims, the MFF and people pushing that ideology are worried about the offender,” said Minnesota state Rep. Paul Novotny, a retired cop and GOP leader of the Public Safety Finance and Policy Committee. “I’m not against bail, bail is guaranteed in the state constitution, but our founders put it there … to ensure people show up for their next court hearing and to encourage them not to reoffend,” he said. “If you commit a violent crime and there’s no consequences for you, if you have no skin in the game, there’s no incentive for you not to reoffend.” The fund reportedly posted $100,000 bail for Darnika Floyd, who was charged with second-degree murder and accused of stabbing a man to death after he said he wanted a threesome with her and a friend. She was sentenced to prison in 2021 on a charge of aiding and abetting murder. It also stepped up for Christopher Boswell, a twice-convicted rapist who was charged with kidnapping and sexual assault who was released on $350,000 bail after the fund put up the cash for him. He was sentenced to prison in 2023 for criminal sexual conduct. Lionel Melaki Timms, 36, was bailed out by MFF for $10,000 after committing a felony third-degree assault aboard a bus in Bloomington. Less than a month later, he was re-arrested after he nearly beat a local bar manager to death, leaving the victim with a traumatic brain injury, authorities alleged. “By bailing out dangerous criminals, [MFF] has brought pain and distress to victims and all Minnesotans who no longer feel safe in their communities due to the rise of crime,” Republican Minnesota state Rep. Mary Franson told The Post. Franson authored the Bail Abatement Nonprofit Exclusion, or BANE act, which forbids nonprofits like MFF from paying criminal suspects’ bail. She presented it as an amendment in 2021 and again in 2022 but it never got off the ground, due in part to a “stellar” lobbying campaign MFF waged in opposition. The seven-term congresswoman said crime in the Twin Cities “skyrocketed” in the wake of the George Floyd riots, police ranks have sharply dipped amid a hostile climate towards law enforcement. She added that that even the grounds of the state capitol in St. Paul are no longer safe for lawmakers to walk alone at night. “MFF has made Minnesota less safe. Tim Walz and Kamala Harris have ruined public safety in Minnesota, and you can see that through our crime stats,” she said, adding she has “no doubt” the same blueprint would be rolled out nationwide under a Harris-Walz administration.","summary":"As his state's largest city was engulfed in flames, Gov.

The YouGov surveys conducted for The Economist began asking Americans in the middle of July how they saw their household’s financial prospects would fare one year from now. Given the depressed state of most surveys of consumer sentiment, you will not be surprised that just 22 percent said that they expect to be financially better off in a year. Another 35 percent said they expect their household financial situation to be mostly the same. Twenty-two percent said they thought things would get worse. And twenty-two percent said they were not sure. The most recent survey, conducted between August 4 and 6, found only small changes to those figures. Twenty-four percent said they think they’ll be better off, 20 percent said they expect to be worse off, 38 percent think things will be about the same, and 18 percent said they weren’t sure. A Big, Hidden Partisan Shift in Economic Optimism The relative stability in the shares of the pessimists and the optimists, however, masks some big changes in who is optimistic and who is pessimistic. The mid-July survey found that one-third of people who said they intend to vote for Biden expected to be better off in a year. Forty-four percent of Biden supporters expected household finances to be about the same. Just 10 percent expected to be worse off. Among Trump supporters, 19 percent said they thought they would be better off, 28 percent expected things to be about the same, and 33 percent expected to be worse off. In the survey taken a week later, there was some movement. Trump supporters became more positive about their prospects. The share of Trump supporters expecting things to get better for their household rose to 24 percent. The share expecting their household finances to worsen fell 10 points to 22 percent. The driver here was likely the collapsing chances of Biden being elected to a second term, culminating with his announcement that he was stepping down from the race and endorsing Kamala Harris. In the mid-July survey, 91 percent of Trump supporters said they expected Trump would win in November. By the third week of July, this was up to 95 percent. Among the broader public, the share saying they expected Trump would win rose from 49 percent to 52 percent. There was already a building enthusiasm for Kamala Harris among Democrats, but it was not yet seeping into the views of Trump supporters. In mid-July, only 26 percent of voters said they expected Biden would win, including 63 percent of Biden supporters. By the third week of July, 31 percent of voters said they expected Harris would win, including 75 percent of self-declared Harris supporters. Two weeks ago, the share of the broader public who expected Harris to win rose to 40 percent, and the share of Harris supporters who expected their candidate to win jumped to 80 percent. Donald Trump’s share of voters who expect him to win fell 10 points to 42 percent. Most notably, the share of Trump supporters who thought he would win fell to 87 percent—an eight point decline in a single week. There was some movement in that survey from the final week of July in the household financial prospects question—but not much. The share of Harris supporters expecting to be better off was unchanged, and the share of Trump supporters expecting to be better off ticked down two points to 22 percent. Harris Takes the Lead The big shift happened in the most recent survey. Harris now leads among voters when it comes to who they think will win, at forty percent versus Trump’s 38 percent. Among Harris supporters, 81 percent say they think she will win. Among Trump supporters, 81 percent say they think he’ll win—down another six points from the survey one week prior and down 14 points over the past week. The once wide political optimism gap between supporters of Trump and his Democrat rival has closed. In the new survey, just 15 percent of Trump supporters say they expect to be better off, a seven point decline. Forty percent of Harris supporters say they think they’ll be better off in a year, a six point increase. In other words, Harris has inspired not just confidence in her supporters that she can get elected but also that her election will improve their household finances. Meanwhile, Trump supporters have lost confidence in their candidate’s prospects and their own financial prospects. These big shifts show that the race for the president has dramatically shifted in recent weeks. It’s no wonder that has resulted in a surge in volatility both up and down in the stock market.","summary":"The Kamalanomenon is having a big impact on how people view their economic prospects, but you have to look at the data closely to see it.\n\n\nThe post Breitbart Business Digest: Democrat Economic Optimism Surges, Republican Optimism Fades appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2024/08/07/breitbart-business-digest-democrat-economic-optimism-surges-republican-optimism-fades/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2024/08/kamala-harris-6-20-24-flickr-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 22:40:44","author":"John Carney","authors":["John Carney"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.861},{"id":253623128,"title":"Will Tim Walz’s selection as Harris’s running mate shift the US election?","text":"Washington, DC – In the United States political circles, conventional wisdom dictates that voters only care about the candidate atop the presidential ticket, not the running mate. While vice presidential picks can play a role in public opinion, voters cast ballots mostly for the headliners — or so the argument goes. In the 2024 presidential race, that means much of the attention will fall to Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump, the Democratic and Republican nominees, respectively. But as Harris zips across the country on a campaign blitz, she is poised to put that logic to the test. She is campaigning side by side with her newly minted running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, stopping in the battleground states of Wisconsin and Michigan on Wednesday. Democratic strategists say Harris’s selection of Walz is part of an effort to pull ahead in a neck-and-neck presidential race. His avuncular personality, progressive messaging and middle-class Midwestern roots seem well-suited to answer specific Democratic needs: The party needs to shore up its progressive base and shed the shroud of coastal elitism if it hopes to reclaim the White House in November. But take that optimism about Walz with a grain — or a shaker full — of salt, said Allan Lichtman, a history professor at American University. “You can take all the punditry on the effect of the Walz pick on the election’s outcome and do with it what the great philosopher David Hume said you should do with works of superstition: Consign it to the flames,” Lichtman said. “There is no evidence that a VP pick influences the outcomes of a presidential election.” Still, with an unconventional presidential race unfolding, some analysts question how Walz’s selection might be perceived among voters over the long term — and whether he may indeed buoy Harris’s prospects. An unusual race Walz’s appointment to the Democratic ticket on Tuesday came as the latest chapter in an unusual campaign season. Less than three weeks ago, the race seemed destined to pit two of the oldest nominees in presidential history against one another on election day: Trump and the incumbent president, Democrat Joe Biden. Trump had already notched his share of firsts during the presidential race. In May, the Republican leader became the first US presidential candidate ever to be convicted on criminal charges. He is also the only former president in recent history to mount a serious effort to overturn a previous election loss. But a new twist in the election saga came on July 21, when President Biden dropped out of the race after mounting concerns about his age. Biden had been the Democratic frontrunner. Never in modern history had the presumptive nominee dropped out so late in the race. His decision upended the Democratic ticket with just months until the vote. But Biden’s departure paved the way for Vice President Harris to lead the Democratic ticket. Her choice to pick Walz as a running mate came on the same day as she was officially certified to be the party nominee. Lichtman, the American University professor, explained that Walz ticked a number of boxes for the Harris campaign. A vice presidential candidate must have at least a rudimentary compatibility with their running mate and a level of experience to show they would be able to fill the president’s seat, Lichtman said. Otherwise, the running mate could reflect poorly on the presidential candidate’s decision-making skills. Other than that, vice presidential picks are often sidelined or dismissed as less relevant to political campaigns. Trump himself espoused that view. In July, he selected JD Vance, a 40-year-old senator from Ohio, to be his running mate. But when asked about his decision last week, Trump offered a startling moment of candour. “Historically, the vice president, in terms of the election, does not have any impact,” Trump said. “You have two or three days where there’s a lot of commotion as to — like you’re having it on the Democrat side — who it’s going to be. And then that dies down. And it’s all about the presidential pick.” ‘Just enough votes’ Barbara Perry, a professor in presidential studies at the University of Virginia’s Miller Center, acknowledged Trump’s position is “not totally incorrect” historically. But she questioned whether that history will apply in a race that continues to veer into uncharted territory. Perry added that history has been an unreliable predictor in modern US presidential races, which are increasingly decided by razor-thin margins. In the last six presidential elections, just one race — 2008’s match-up between Barack Obama and John McCain — was decided by more than five percentage points nationally. In two of those last six elections, the victorious candidates lost the national popular vote, a phenomenon that had not happened since 1888, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. That includes George W Bush’s win over Al Gore and Trump’s victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. In both cases, the Republican candidate prevailed over the Democratic one. Their wins came as a product of the Electoral College system, in which each state represents a certain number of electors. The vast majority of states award all their electors to whichever candidate wins the most votes in the state, no matter how narrowly. The candidate who earns the most electors overall becomes president. The Electoral College system has been a “concern for Democrats” in recent years, Perry said. “They can run up the score in the popular vote in places like California and New York and come out millions of votes ahead of the GOP nationally, but the Electoral College is now tipped towards the GOP,” Perry explained. Harris herself is from California, a solidly blue state. To win the presidency, she needs support in key swing states in the South and Midwest, where a lot of Electoral College votes are up for grabs. “So getting a vice president who could appeal in Michigan could appeal in Wisconsin — maybe in Pennsylvania and maybe in Arizona as well — [has become a top priority],” Perry said. “Those are key, key battleground states.” Walz could shore up “just enough votes to help Kamala Harris win”. Can Walz be a difference-maker? As with most election predictions, only time will tell if Walz can make an impact on the outcome of the race. The Minnesota governor had little in the way of a national profile until he emerged on Harris’s short list of possible vice presidential picks. That list, composed primarily of white men from battleground states, reflected the long-held political trope that a successful presidential ticket must contain a white man as a “balancing” or reassuring force. Harris herself is Black and Asian American. Kimberly Peeler-Allen, the co-founder of Higher Heights, a group that aims to support Black women in politics, described the strategy as using a white male politician as a “validator” for some voters. “It’s going to be a long time before we are, as a country, comfortable with having two people of colour on the ticket or even two women, as unfortunate as that is,” Peeler-Allen told Al Jazeera. “But this is a racist, sexist, patriarchal society that we live in, and we can’t escape that.” American University’s Perry also said the campaign tactic reflects a “paternal view of presidents going back to George Washington” and a legacy of pairing a history-making candidate with a running mate considered more palatable to those wary of change. She pointed to the 1960 presidential race, which featured John F Kennedy. He was the youngest US presidential candidate ever, and he would go on to be the first Catholic president in the country’s history. But to “balance” his ticket, Kennedy tapped Texas politician Lyndon B Johnson, a Protestant 11 years his senior, as his running mate. Walz has also drawn comparisons to Biden, when the latter was tapped as a running mate for Obama’s historic run in 2008. That election saw Obama become the country’s first Black president. Analysts say both Biden and Walz are seen as charismatic, outspoken older white politicians with ties to battleground states: Pennsylvania in Biden’s case and, in Walz’s, Minnesota. Born in Nebraska and educated at a state college, Walz’s bona fides as a former high-school teacher, American football coach and military veteran may make him a particularly appealing political asset. Some analysts see him as an antidote to the Trump campaign’s criticisms that Harris is a “radical liberal” out of step with middle America. The Harris team has already sought to portray Walz as a champion of the middle class. In their first joint appearance on Tuesday, Harris played up his image as a unifying force. “Since the day that I announced my candidacy, I set out to find a partner who can help build this brighter future — a leader who will help unite our nation and move us forward, a fighter for the middle class, a patriot who believes, as I do, in the extraordinary promise of America,” Harris said. “I am here today because I found such a leader.” Walz, in turn, has won attention for his plainspoken manner. He sparked an internet-ready meme when he described the current Republican ticket as, simply, “weird”. Arshad Hasan, a Democratic political strategist, is among those who see parallels between Walz and Biden. “The caricature of Uncle Joe is generally a beloved caricature,” Hasan said. “So now we get an Uncle Tim. We’re still seeing something like that on the ticket. This folksy Midwestern charm.” He believes Walz’s charisma could prove particularly relevant to battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Winning the trio of states is considered the surest path to the White House, as has proved the case for Trump in 2016 and Biden in 2020. Hasan pointed to Walz’s embrace of Midwestern cuisine as something that is resonating with local voters in the region. “I’m already seeing memes about people bringing hotdish to the Democratic Convention,” he said, referring to a beloved Midwestern casserole. Party energiser? Hasan explained that Walz’s entrance into the race may also shore up the diverse segments of the Democratic party. After all, when Walz was named to the Democratic ticket, both progressives and centrists hailed the decision. On social media, progressive lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez quipped that the Democratic Party was showing “disconcerting levels of array” after months of in-fighting. That is significant since some political analysts argue that the race may come down to who can turn out their base in the largest number, rather than winning over independent voters or disaffected members of the opposing party. Hasan described Walz as a skilled communicator of progressive policies and the “preferred choice” of that flank of the party. He also noted that other contenders for the running-mate slot would have roiled certain Democratic interest groups. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, for example, was considered a top candidate to be Harris’s running mate, but he had clashed with labour unions in the past. Another contender, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, had received criticism for his staunch support of Israel’s war in Gaza, which has killed at least 39,677 Palestinians. In recent months, Shapiro compared pro-Palestine campus protesters to the Ku Klux Klan, making him a non-starter for some Democratic voters. Previously, as a member of Congress, Walz had also pushed for unconditional aid to Israel, but advocates say they are heartened by his appeals for a Gaza ceasefire. He has also shown support for the hundreds of thousands of voters who cast “uncommitted” ballots during the Democratic primary season to protest Biden’s stance on Israel. In a statement on Tuesday, Elianne Farhat, a senior adviser to the “uncommitted” movement, said Walz “has demonstrated a remarkable ability to evolve as a public leader”. She called on Walz to support an arms embargo. “While his past positions as a Congressman may have conflicted with anti-war voters, we hope he can evolve on this issue as he has on others,” Farhat wrote.","summary":"Harris&#039;s choice for vice president has energised Democrats.

We don't take him seriously. He means it.\"Biden's remarks, which air fully on Sunday following a brief preview by CBS, came soon after Harris had sounded the alarm over Trump's conduct in the opposite scenario -- victory for the 78-year-old billionaire.Speaking to a crowd in Eau Claire, Wisconsin as part of a multi-day tour of swing states, she used the former president's own words -- as well as his felony convictions -- to argue that a second Trump term would be a disaster for the country. She pointed to his vow to be a dictator \"on day one,\" his threats to weaponize the Justice Department against his political enemies and his 2022 comment demanding the \"termination\" of constitutional provisions over his defeat in the last election.\"Someone who suggests that we should terminate the constitution of the United States should never again have a chance to stand behind the seal of the President of the United States,\" Harris said, exhorting Americans to reject the \"chaos, fear and hate\" of Trumpism.The 59-year-old vice president was on day two of a blitz of the most closely-fought election battlegrounds as she seeks to capitalize on a surging excitement since she replaced President Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket in July.Harris and her new running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, will take their double act later to a rally in Detroit, Michigan and there will be further stops through Saturday in the racially diverse \"Sun Belt\" states of Arizona and Nevada. In Wisconsin, she and Walz sketched out a vision of future prosperity for the middle class, repeatedly speaking of their pride in the country and making a virtue of the patriotism more associated with Republican rhetoric in the pre-Trump era. But Harris cautioned that allowing Trump back into office would take the country backwards.Recalling that while she took on frauds and sexual abusers as California's attorney general, Trump had been found liable for the sexual assault of a New York writer and had been both convicted and sued for millions of dollars for fraud. \"In this campaign, I'll tell you, I will proudly put my record against his any day of the week,\" she said.The rally came a day Harris and Walz held the biggest Democratic event of the election so far in front of a raucous crowd of around 14,000 in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania.Seen initially as an outsider for the VP pick, Walz enjoyed viral success in distilling Democrats' attack lines against Republicans into a relatable one-word characterization -- \"weird\" -- that propelled him up Harris's shortlist.The 60-year-old former Army National Guard officer railed against the \"dangerous and backward beliefs\" of Trump and his running mate, US senator J.D. Vance, leading a chant of the Harris campaign slogan \"We're not going back.\"Harris selected Walz over Josh Shapiro, the moderate governor of the highly-prized swing state of Pennsylvania, and Republicans have sought to brand her vice presidential pick as much further left than the candidate who lost out.Trump has declined to focus on his opponents' vulnerabilities on policy, instead favoring personal attacks against Harris that have had little impact on her rise in the polls. The vice president has a 51-48 percent lead over Trump in the latest NPR/PBS News/Marist survey and has edged ahead by 0.5 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics nationwide average of polls.The organization had Trump three points ahead of Biden at the point when the president made way for Harris, 17 days ago.","summary":"President Joe Biden said Wednesday he is \"not confident\" Donald Trump would concede peacefully if he loses the US election, as the Republican's rival Kamala Harris warned a Trump victory would usher in a lawless administration set on curtailing Americans' freedoms.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/biden-harris-warn-trump-threat-democracy-election-looms-1850381","image":"https://d.ibtimes.com.au/en/full/1856132/democratic-presidential-candidate-kamala-harris-her-running-mate-tim-walz-held-biggest-democratic.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-07 22:36:11","author":"Kamil Krzaczynski With Frankie Taggart In Washington","authors":["Kamil Krzaczynski With Frankie Taggart In Washington"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.421},{"id":253623124,"title":"Steve Martin reportedly declines offer to play Gov.

(Patrick Harbron) “Only Murders in the Building” star Steve Martin has reportedly declined Saturday Night Live producer Lorne Michaels’ offer to play Gov.

JD Vance of Ohio, “weird people” during an appearance on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.” This week, the online obsession with Minnesota’s governor reached a fever pitch when Vice President Kamala Harris chose him as her running mate. Walz’s public portrait has been fueled in large part by what some call his “big dad energy,” which can be best summed up as a uniquely midwestern blend of self-sufficiency served alongside a series of jokes that would prompt any teenager to perform an eye roll. Online commentators have pitched several other comedians who might tap into that sensibility to imitate Walz on the long-running sketch comedy show, which premieres its 50th season on Sept. 28. (Jim Gaffigan, anyone?) Maya Rudolph is set to return as Harris, the Times reports. But she cleared her calendar and even moved production of her Apple TV+ series in order to accommodate the gig.

Kamala Harris’s selection of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz on Tuesday was a sign that her campaign has no plans to cede any ground in Wisconsin, Michigan or Pennsylvania — three states that have been critical in the past three election cycles. The selection of Walz, an affable football coach, former Army National Guardsman, and high school teacher, was a starting gun in the battle for the white working class that backed Trump in 2016. JD Vance, meanwhile, has built a national brand around being a son of Appalachia whose background inspired both a strong social conservatism as well as a populist economic bent that mirrors Trump’s own. Vance, like his running mate, rails against multinational trade deals he blames for sending manufacturing centers overseas and was the lone Republican member of Congress to show up on a picket line in 2023. So what similarities can be drawn between the two midwestern politicians’ platforms, and where does the divide fall? Despite all the grief Vance is likely to give the Harris campaign over the current state of the US economy, issues of trade and labor policy are among the greatest areas of agreement between Walz and his new archrival. First, let’s take the minimum wage. Walz, as a Democrat, carved out a careful moderate stance when the issue of pay rates for Uber and Lyft drivers came up under his tenure. Blocking a minimum pay rate bill that was causing the two companies to threaten to leave the state, Walz worked with rideshare companies to write a different bill which he signed into law this year — drivers are still expected to see their rates rise under the new law. Vance is one of just a few Republicans on Capitol Hill who also supports efforts to raise wages through legislation. The Ohio senator signed on to a piece of legislation in 2023 that would have raised the federal minimum wage to $11 and indexed it to inflation. Moving on to trade: Walz and Vance have both made reputations for themselves as free trade skeptics. When he was in Congress, Walz voted repeatedly against trade bills he argued would lead to more jobs being outsourced overseas, including legislation that would have streamlined Barack Obama’s ability to secure an agreement on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). Vance has railed repeatedly against both NAFTA, as well as the US support for China joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2000. The two both claim to be pro-union as well. Walz has supported an ambitious progressive labor agenda as governor of Minnesota, including outlawing non-compete agreements and barring businesses from penalizing employees for refusing to participate in what are called “captive audience meetings” where anti-union materials are distributed and discussed. Walz is a former United Auto Workers (UAW) member and like Vance appeared on a picket line for the Auto Workers in 2023. The senator does not, however, support the PRO Act — a piece of federal legislation meant to protect collective bargaining which is strongly supported by national unions. The two men vying to be America’s next vice president both claim to be pro-family. They have widely disparate ideas about what that means. Vance’s views on the American family have been in the center of the spotlight in the weeks since he was nominated at the GOP convention in July. Unearthed comments from 2021 reveal him attacking unmarried women, childless Americans of both genders and arguing that Americans with children should be granted extra votes at the ballot box. He has stated that he does not believe Americans without children — for whatever reason — have the same “stake” in the country’s future as those who do. Along with those statements, which have caused headaches for the Trump-Vance campaign, Vance believes in a laundry list of socially conservative positions. Like many conservatives a decade after gay marriage protections were established country-wide, Vance doesn’t make his views on whether he thinks it should be legal clear; he dodged such questions in 2022 when a bill to codify those protections into law was moving through Congress while stating that he’d oppose the bill on religious liberty grounds. He’s also spoken out repeatedly against divorce and raised concerns about America’s birthrate. Walz is, of course, the polar opposite — a progressive on social policy who declared his state a “refuge” for transgender Americans and whose selection as VP nominee is a clear sign that Harris will continue her embrace of the LGBTQ community as she campaigns for president. And he’s a proud supporter of IVF, having used fertility treatments in the conception of his daughter Hope. On the issue of abortion, Vance’s views are notable too. He supports a national abortion ban, something his running mate claims he would not sign into law. That discrepancy has been a target of Democratic attacks, as Harris’s party seeks to block Trump’s efforts to escape the most extreme anti-abortion legislation members of his party have championed around the country. America’s footprint abroad is another major area of division between Walz and Vance as voters face a major crossroads on the issue of Ukraine this November. President Joe Biden and Harris alongside him have made financial, political and strategic support for Ukraine and its military a keystone of their foreign policy over the last three and a half years. Under Biden’s leadership, Congress has sent billions of dollars in munitions, vehicles, arms and other resources to Ukraine to support its defense against Russia’s invasion, a position that can be largely described as the consensus among America’s foreign policy establishment in Washington. Liberal and conservative voices in the national security sphere have both professed the importance of countering Russian aggression in Ukraine and halting further such moves by Moscow in Eastern Europe. Walz was a vocal supporter of this view before joining the Harris 2024 ticket, and that’s not about to change. Vance, meanwhile, is one of the most vocal Ukraine skeptics in Congress. In unearthed text messages published by The Washington Post on Wednesday, he declared to fringe conspiracy theorist (and Holocaust revisionist) Charles (“Chuck”) Johnson that he “won’t even take calls from Ukraine” and described futile efforts by top Ukrainian officials to discuss the issue of funding bills with his office: “Two very senior guys reached out to me. The head of their intel. The head of the Air Force. Bitching about F16s.” In 2022, he also declared on Steve Bannon’s War Room podcast: \"I gotta be honest with you, I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.\" China is another issue where the two men differ substantially. Vance is supportive of Trump’s efforts to spark what many experts have called a “trade war” with China, a series of tit-for-tat tariffs aimed at helping US industries. Walz, meanwhile, has pointed to the need to maintain stable trade relations with China, arguing its importance for US farmers who export crops abroad.","summary":"America’s two vice presidential nominees have widely differing ideas about how to win the Rust Belt","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/walz-vance-policies-vice-president-b2592961.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/08/06/18/vps.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/mZjP8sH4-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-07 22:30:37","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.077},{"id":253623396,"title":"What does Trump’s new nickname for Kamala Harris mean?

Tim Walz as a running mate only supercharged the Democratic Party’s momentum. In response, Trump’s cap-heavy rants on his Truth Social site have begun to include references to the Democratic presidential nominee as “Kamabla.” “Kamabla Harris is afraid to Debate me on FoxNews. She will be easier to defeat on the Debate Stage than Crooked Joe Biden, just watch!” Trump wrote on Monday. That same day, he also wrote that “Kamabla is the WORST V.P.” Trump has since used this inscrutable misspelling of Harris’ first name enough times that HuffPost’s S.V. Dáte reached out to the Trump campaign, and received this equally inscrutable response. CNN’s Kaitlan Collins was puzzled enough that she asked North Dakota governor and Trump campaign surrogate Doug Burgum what the hell “Kamabla” is supposed to mean. “I cannot comment on that,” Burgum responded, before pivoting to tired GOP talking points. Reporters and online sleuths have been trying to figure out the purpose of using “Kamabla.” Theories about the nickname’s origins range from Trump trying to be racist in some clunky way, to rapid cognitive decline, to a simple typo the narcissistic Trump is unwilling to correct.
