The shift, Enten argued, is not some small wobble. It is a collapse.\n\nBolduan started with the obvious question. “Have polls always been down for Trump when it comes to inflation?” she asked.\n\n“No, no, not at all,” Enten replied. He pointed back to October 2024 when Trump was still seen as the stronger hand on the cost of living. “Go back to October of 2024. Who did Americans trust more on inflation, Kamala Harris or Donald Trump? They trusted Donald Trump by nine points on average.”\n\nThat cushion is gone because, according to Enten, those same surveys now show Trump’s net approval on inflation “way, way, way underwater, 26 points underwater on his net approval on inflation.”\n\nThe message to Trump was sharp with the data analyst stating, “So it’s not that the polls are fake, it’s that the American people have turned against you, Mr. President, you’ve gone from leading by nine points on inflation to being 26 points underwater. You’re doing something very wrong in the minds of the American public.”\n\nBolduan did not sugarcoat it. “Negative 26. That’s a problem,” she said.\n\nFor Trump, who has spent months claiming that survey firms underestimate his support, there was more bad news. Enten gamed out the former president’s favorite hypothetical, that the polling is simply off the way it was in 2024.\n\n“You see this switcheroo, right, going from plus 9 to minus 26. That’s a move of over 30 points in the wrong direction,” Enten said. “But let’s say the polls are off. Let’s take up Donald Trump on his hypothetical, right? Oh, the polls always underestimate me. Well, here’s Trump’s net approval rating on inflation. Currently, he’s 26 points below water. If the polls are off like they were in 2024, he still got a Titanic sized problem. He’s then 24 points underwater on inflation.”\n\nIn other words, even if the survey error breaks exactly the way Trump says it will, he is still in dreadful shape with voters on the issue they say matters most.\n\n“So yes, the polls underestimated him, but just by about a point and a half in 2024,” Enten continued. “He would still have a massive, massive, massive problem on inflation even if the polls were off like they were a year ago.”\n\nAnd there is another risk for Trump and his party as Enten noted that in recent races “the polls are absolutely awful” at catching late Democratic strength, pointing to contests in Virginia and New Jersey where Democrats Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger beat their polling by sizable margins. That raises the possibility that Republicans are being overestimated this time, not shortchanged.\n\n“The bottom line is this, the polls on inflation are absolutely awful for Donald Trump,” Enten concluded. “Even if they were slightly better, he’d still be way, way below water. But the problem … might be even worse than the polls suggest.” Voters do not need a chart to know why, he added, because “people feel it in their pocketbooks every day and they see it as the prices climb ever higher when they try and purchase their groceries.”\n\nFor a president who built his brand on economic swagger, that kind of slide is not just a bad news cycle. It is a warning flare.","summary":"Trump insists the polls are fake, but new data shows his inflation numbers sinking fast.","url":"https://www.inquisitr.com/trumps-economic-numbers-are-falling-apart-and-the-real-picture-could-be-worse","image":"https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/donald-trump-8.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 23:30:26","author":"Frank Yemi","authors":["Frank Yemi"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.724},{"id":379393344,"title":"UK PM Urged to Defend National Interests as Trump Threatens Legal Action Against BBC","text":"Sir Keir Starmer is being urged to take a firm stance for the UK and dissuade Donald Trump from pursuing a massive lawsuit against the BBC.\n\nOn Friday evening, the former US President declared his intention to demand up to $5 billion (£3.8 billion) in compensation, alleging that the broadcaster had misrepresented one of his speeches through selective editing.\n\nWhile the BBC has issued an apology, they have refused to compensate Trump financially, paving the way for a potentially high-profile legal battle.\n\nTrump’s statements have caused significant concern within the BBC, which now confronts the daunting possibility of expending large sums of licence-fee payers’ money to either contest or settle the case.\n\nThe President mentioned plans to contact Sir Keir over the weekend to discuss the situation, noting that the Prime Minister felt ‘very embarrassed’ by the developments.\n\nWith the BBC’s future seemingly at risk, Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey has called on the Prime Minister to leverage his rapport with Trump to persuade him to drop the lawsuit.\n\n‘This is Keir Starmer’s moment to stand up for Britain and call on Trump to drop his ludicrous lawsuit,’ he said. ‘The Prime Minister has spent months cosying up to Trump. If he can’t stop him from attacking one of our most precious institutions, what was it all for?’\n\nMeanwhile, former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has said it is now time for the scandal-hit BBC to appoint an internal watchdog.\n\nMr Trump is expected to launch his lawsuit in Florida. The Panorama film which contained the edit appearing to show him inciting Capitol Hill protesters to violence on January 6, 2021, was not available in the US, but experts believe the case could still come before a jury, which is likely to be sympathetic to the President.\n\nBBC chairman Samir Shah last week sent a personal letter to the White House to apologise for the editing, which has not been enough to satisfy the President.\n\nSpeaking on Air Force One on Friday, Mr Trump said of his legal action: ‘I think I have to do it. They’ve even admitted that they cheated… They changed the words coming out of my mouth.’\n\n‘The people of the UK are very angry about what happened as you can imagine because it shows the BBC is fake news.’\n\nIn a separate interview on GB News on Friday night, Mr Trump claimed he had an ‘obligation’ to sue the BBC, which he branded ‘corrupt’ and ‘beyond fake’. ‘This was so egregious. If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people. I’d like to find out why they did it.’\n\nSam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign official, today said he believed the President had ‘a pretty solid case’ and that the BBC’s lawyers would probably be unable to persuade a judge to throw the claim out of court and could face a settlement of millions. \n\n‘I think the BBC should be taking this extremely seriously. I think [a settlement] would be high seven figures. It’s a large amount of money.’\n\nIn July, US media giant Paramount agreed to pay Mr Trump $16 million (£13.5 million) to settle a lawsuit over an interview on CBS with former Vice-President Kamala Harris, which he said was edited too sympathetically.\n\nBut speaking to The Mail on Sunday, Lord Patten, a former chairman of the BBC, said: ‘The BBC board should tell Donald Trump they will see him in court. The BBC is part of our democracy, and an important part. \n\n‘I am not in favour of kowtowing to Trump about this absurd charge.’ \n\nSir Craig Oliver, a former BBC executive and director of communications for Prime Minister David Cameron, said the corporation faced a ‘nightmare situation… It does clearly believe that it’s got a strong case but really the problem is that public money could be spent – or is going to be spent – fighting this or settling this.’\n\nFormer Tory Culture Secretary Sir John Whittingdale added: ‘It would be highly undesirable to have the BBC having to defend what was clearly a very serious failing of editorial judgment in an American court.

Obama’s comment came during a Nov. 5 conversation at the Brooklyn Academy of Music for her podcast. The discussion was between the former first lady and actor Tracee Ellis Ross, during which they discussed Obama’s new book, “The Look.” Ross had asked Obama if she felt that the first lady role, serving as an archetype for “wifedom and femininity,” had affected “the room that we’ve made for a woman to be president.” “You know, we got a lot of growing up to do, and there’s still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it,” Obama continued. Obama stumped for Harris on the 2024 campaign trail, drawing large crowds to campaign events, advocating for women’s health care and pleading with men to vote for Harris.

The former first lady doesn't think the United States is 'ready' to have a female president.Michelle Obama On Possible Presidential Career: 'Don't Waste My Time'Former First Lady Michelle Obama had an honest conversation with Tracee Ellis Ross at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. During the chat, the latter asked the former whether preconceived notions of 'femininity' and 'wifedom' might affect the US's ability to elect a female president, based on past observations.Michelle responded that the country is not ready to have a woman in the Oval Office. She recounted former Vice President Kamala Harris's defeat to President Donald Trump in the 2024 election and clarified that she has no plans to join the presidential race.'Sadly, we ain't ready,' Michelle said. 'That's why I'm like, \"Don't even look at me about running because you are all lying.\" You are not ready for a woman. You are not.'Barack Obama's wife is determined to distance herself from the same position her husband once held. 'So don't waste my time,' Michelle added, noting that 'We got a lot of growing up to do.'The Becoming author also shared that many men are not open to having a female leader, and that's evident.Michelle Previously Said, 'I Will Not Run For President'It's not the first time Michelle Obama has shut down speculation about her joining the presidential race, despite being among the most popular choices for Democrats. She's been consistent in showing her disinterest in the position even when she was still serving as the first lady.'I will not run for president. No, nope, not going to do it,' Michelle said when she spoke at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Texas, in 2016, CNN reported.Although Michelle wanted to serve the people, the ex-FLOTUS said at the time that she preferred to do it in 'an unbiased way.' Hence, her desire to keep herself away from political disputes.In a Netflix special, Michelle acknowledged that 'Politics is hard,' so anyone who enters it should 'want it.' Apparently, she's not feeling that way.'It's got to be in your soul, because it is so important. It is not in my soul,' she added (via NBC News).Michelle Obama Could Have Beaten Trump in the 2024 ElectionMichelle Obama may not be interested in returning to the Oval Office, much more in coming back to it as the head of state. However, the people have faith in her and her capacity to lead the country.Ipsos, a global market research and public opinion company, published a report in March 2024 that indicated Michelle's chances of beating Trump in the election. 'Only Michelle Obama bests Trump as an alternative to Biden in 2024, the title read.The data showed that 50% favoured Obama to be the Democratic candidate for the highest office. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris trailed behind her at 40% and 42%, respectively.Michelle received more votes than Donald Trump, who, like Biden, had only a 40% favourable score among registered voters.Many might prefer Michelle to be the next US president, but she doesn't feel that they are the majority. Also, she is stern in keeping herself away from politics.","url":"https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/youre-not-ready-woman-michelle-obama-says-america-having-female-president-1755252","image":"https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1764330/michelle-obama.png?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=d04788ff94a4be29e25663b11b0b53ee","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 20:58:48","author":"Catherine Armecin Martin","authors":["Catherine Armecin Martin"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.133},{"id":379386644,"title":"BBC has had ‘no further contact’ from Donald Trump’s lawyers ‘at this point’","text":"The BBC has had “no further contact from President Trump’s lawyers at this point”, a spokesperson for the corporation said.\n\nThey added that the BBC’s “position remains the same” after Donald Trump said he will still sue the corporation following its apology over the editing of a 2021 speech broadcast by Panorama.\n\nMr Trump told reporters on board Air Force One he would sue the corporation for “anywhere between one billion dollars (£759.8 million) and five billion dollars (£3.79 billion), probably sometime next week”.\n\nHis comments followed an apology from the BBC on Thursday in which it said the edit of Mr Trump’s speech on January 6 2021 had given the “mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action”.\n\nThe broadcaster apologised and said the splicing of the speech was an “error of judgment” but refused to pay financial compensation after the US president’s lawyers threatened to sue for one billion dollars in damages unless a retraction and apology were published.\n\nOn Saturday, a BBC spokesperson said: “We have had no further contact from President Trump’s lawyers at this point.

You are not. So don't waste my time.”\n\n Elaborating further as the BAM audience broke out into applause, the author said: “We got a lot of growing up to do, and there are still, sadly, a lot of men who do not feel like they can be led by a woman, and we saw it.”\n\n Though supporters continue to cling to the hope she may change her mind, Michelle has consistently shut down calls for her to launch a presidential bid — or any other career in politics — since at least 2012.\n\n While appearing on Today in celebration of the International Day of the Girl in 2018, anchor Savannah Guthrie asked if the former first lady was interested in pursuing a career in politics, to which she replied: “Absolutely not.”\n\n \"I’ve never wanted to be a politician,” Michelle continued at the time. “Nothing has changed in me. I want to serve. … There are so many ways to make an impact. Politics is not my thing.

My husband is doing just fine. We are the former president and first lady, and so I feel like this is the first time in my life that when I say and do something, here in this interview, writing this book, these are my choices,” she said. “That is freeing.”","summary":"\"You're not ready for a woman.

The conversation was posted online on Friday. The former first lady is among Democrats’ most effective — and popular — surrogates, which for years, has fueled a desire among her supporters that she run for president. Michelle Obama has repeatedly shut down that speculation. “I will not run for president. No, nope, not going to do it,” she said in 2016 while still serving as first lady. Obama campaigned for Harris last year, raising alarm about what she described as the threat Trump poses to the country, particularly to women’s health. “Please, please do not hand our fates over to the likes of Trump, who knows nothing about us, who has shown deep contempt for us,” Obama said at a Michigan rally days before the election. “Because a vote for him is a vote against us, against our health, against our worth.” At the same rally, Obama asked the crowd: “By every measure, (Harris) has demonstrated that she’s ready. … The real question is, as a country, are we ready for this moment?” CNN’s David Wright contributed to this report.","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/michelle-obama-woman-president-not-ready","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-2181275446.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 19:55:04","author":"Kaanita Iyer","authors":["Kaanita Iyer"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.173},{"id":379360140,"title":"Stephen A Smith defends political commentary approach, says it 'encourages' dialogue from both sides","text":"In recent years, Stephen A.

What the First Lady wears is one of the main ways which you've already said that a First Lady has talked about it comes with so much historical expectation. How do you feel about the fact that the First Lady is an archetype for wifedom and femininity?\"In response, Obama said that she does not believe in this idea, explaining:\"Yeah, I don't agree with that.

The \"Real Time\" host took specific aim at two prominent democratic socialists during his \"New Rule\" segment, New York City mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. \"Democrats must recognize that Zohran Mamdani is the future of the party. Unfortunately, it's the Republican Party. Get it?\" Maher joked. \"And if you missed his victory speech in last week's mayoral election in New York, don't worry. You'll see it in every attack ad for the next two years.\" BILL MAHER SAYS DEMOCRATS HAVE ‘PRETTY BIG SPLIT’ IN PARTY AFTER ELECTION WINS While Maher admitted that Mamdani \"seems like a nice guy,\" he offered a warning about the Democratic Party's increasing appetite for democratic socialist candidates. Maher urged that before the \"whole left side of the country catches socialism fever,\" to take some advice from another \"big winner\" from last week's special elections. \"… Virginia Governor Elect Abigail Spanberger, who before the ‘24 election said things like, ’If the party didn't shift to the center, we will get torn apart.' And, ‘We need to never use the word socialist or socialism ever again,’\" Maher recalled. \"Well, she was right, but they didn't listen. Typical, am I right, ladies?\" As the Democratic Party appears to be divided between its moderate and progressive wings, Maher asked, \"How do we decide who’s right?\" \"It turns out we don't really have to flip a coin. We have the evidence. In 2024, 13 Democrats won in districts Trump also won, all moderates. This isn't rocket science. All the left-leaning think tanks have done autopsies on 2024, and they all came up with the same message. Move to the center,\" he asserted. BILL MAHER FEARS DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS BECOMING A 'GHOST BRAND,' DRAWS COMPARISON TO SEARS Maher pointed to Vermont’s \"collapsed\" single-payer healthcare system as further evidence against the effectiveness of democratic socialism. \"Democratic socialism is like a dating profile. Things look great until you meet up in the real world. For example, Bernie Sanders. His big thing was always bringing single-payer health care to our country of 340 million. But when liberal, tie-dyed Vermont tried to do it for a population of 626,000, it collapsed,\" he railed. \"Bernie, AOC, Mamdani are not Democrats. They'll be the first to tell you that they're democratic socialists,\" Maher continued. \"And that's a very different thing. And I don't think people know that yet.\" The \"Real Time\" host acknowledged that programs such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps are all technically socialist programs, but argued that members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) — like Mamdani — are far more radical. BILL MAHER SLAMS DEMOCRATS LIKE KAMALA HARRIS AND THE CLINTONS FOR BEING 'AFRAID' TO COME ON HIS SHOW \"All that is socialism. Much of it appropriate to soften the edges of capitalism. But the DSA are radicals about this concept. And radical economic policy is always ineluctably married to radical social policy,\" Maher warned. While Maher was critical of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, he didn’t spare Republicans either. He noted that Americans are \"begging both parties\" to \"act normal\" and find common ground on rational policy. \"It's either defund the police or military in the streets. Either MAGA's crypto-crony capitalism or city-run grocery stores,\" he opined. \"No, I don't want that. I want a Democrat who reassures me, if you like your Whole Foods, you can keep your Whole Foods.\" Maher once again went after both sides of the aisle shortly thereafter, slamming President Donald Trump's \"macho bulls---\" while mocking the left's \"p---y politics.\" CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"You know, at this year's DSA convention, or as it's commonly known, ‘Commie-Con,’ get this.

In a conversation with Kylie Kelce on the \"Not Gonna Lie\" podcast, the former first lady reiterated that she would never consider running for president, citing the impact such a decision would have on daughters Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23.\n\n\"I was so glad when we got out of the White House,\" she told Kelce, emphasizing her concern about raising children under constant public scrutiny. The girls were nine and seven when her husband, Barack Obama, became president in 2009. \"I wanted them to have the freedom of not having the eyes of the world on them,\" she said, adding that even now, \"They still are dealing with paparazzi and being who they are and trying to carve out their own identity.\"\n\nFor that reason, Michelle said, a political campaign is out of the question: \"When people ask me, would I ever run, the answer is no.

After two days in bunker mode following the bombshell release of tens of thousands of Epstein emails, hundreds of which mention him, he finally took questions from reporters on Air Force One - and it got spicy. And earlier he'd granted a particularly slithery interview to British opinion broadcaster GB News, who asked not a single question about the notorious dead paedophile. Meanwhile in Trumpworld Here's everything you need to know If you wanted an illustration of what Trump's bunker mode looks like, you could hardly ask for a better one than this. The President of the United States rattling around his newly paved-over Rose Garden, apparently blasting out all his favourite songs. It's all very sulky teenager, but this is what was really happening at the White House on Friday afternoon. Later, speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump refused to rule out handing convicted sex trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell a presidential pardon. He said: \"I haven't even thought about it. I haven't thought about for months. Maybe I haven't thought about it at all.\" Asked why he would not rule it out, he said: \"I don't rule it in or out.\" Trump has publicly ditched one of his most prominent MAGA-world supporters, calling Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene \"'Wacky' Marjorie\" and saying he would endorse a challenger against her in next year's midterms \"if the right person runs.\" The breakup was a while in the post, as Greene has seemingly moderated her political profile. The three-term US House member has increasingly dissented from Republican leaders, attacking them during the just-ended federal government shutdown and saying they need a plan to help people who are losing subsidies to afford health insurance policies. Accusing her of going “Far Left,” Trump wrote on Truth Social that all he had witnessed from Greene in recent months is “COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!” adding, of Greene's purported irritation that he doesn't return her phone calls, “I can't take a ranting Lunatic's call every day.” Many Brits may know her from her wild exchange with Emily Maitlis, whom she told to \"f*** off\" after being questioned about her promotion of an antisemitic \"Jewish space lasers\" conspiracy theory. In recent months she has been a prominent Republican voice calling for the full release of the Epstein files. Greene Tweeted claiming Trump had “attacked me and lied about me.\" She added a screenshot of a text she said she had sent the president earlier in the day about releasing the Jeffrey Epstein files, which she said “is what sent him over the edge.” She said it was “astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level,” referencing next week’s House vote over releasing the Epstein files. Writing that she had supported Trump \"with too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him,\" Greene added, \"I don't worship or serve Donald Trump.\" The Washington Post has done a sterling job of lining up some of Epstein's texts with reality. In particular, they've identified text exchanges apparently between the notorious paedophile and a Democrat member of Hongress - Stacey Plaskett, delegate to the House from the US Virgin Islands - during a Congressional committee grilling of former Trump fixer Michael Cohen. In one exchange, Epstein's texts appeared to influence her questions. He mentioned \"RONA- keeper of secrets\" to her in one text, misspelling the first name of Trump assistant Rhona Graff.\" \"RONA??\" Plaskett responded. \"Quick I'm up next is that an acronym?\" \"That's his assistant,\" Epstein replied. \"He's opened the door to questions re who are the other henchmen at trump org,\" Epstein later said, to which she responded: \"Yup. Very aware and waiting my turn.\" Later she asked Cohen about Trump associates, saying : \"Are there other people that we should be meeting with?\" \"So Allen Weisselberg is the chief financial officer in The Trump Organization,\" Cohen replied. But Plaskett interrupted, saying: \"You've got to quickly give us as many names as you can so we can get to them. Is Ms. Rhona, what is Ms. Rhona's-- …?\" Cohen replied: \"Rhona Graff is the -- Mr. Trump's executive assistant … She was -- her office is directly next to his, and she's involved in a lot that went on.\" Donald Trump allegedly told friends he was \"banging\" his 28-year-old White House assistant, a prominent author claimed to Jeffrey Epstein. Michael Wolff, who has written several books and articles about Trump, made the claim in a draft of a portion of a book shared with the paedophile financier in a 2019 email. In it, he names Madeleine Westerhout as the assistant. Ms Westerhout last night told the Mirror the claims in Wolff's email were \"absurd\" and \"unhinged from reality\". The email was released as part of a 23,000 document trove of communications and papers handed to Congress by Epstein's estate. The draft recalls Trump's decision to spend the 2018 Christmas holiday at the White House, rather than decamp with his family to Mar A Lago, his Palm Beach, Florida resort. You can read the full story here In a hilariously uncritical Oval Office interview with GB News, Trump reignited his feud with Sadiq Khan. Asked about Sir Sadiq, Trump said: \"He's a terrible, terrible mayor. As an example, I was a high ranking officer, sort of always, or President. Even as a civilian, I was a respected person. He treated me very badly. I said who is that guy? He's a terrible mayor, and look at the crime in London.\" Violent crime is falling in London. There was a 6% reduction in violence against the person recorded by the metropolitan police in the 12 months to March 2025. Londoners are statistically less likely to be a victim of violent crime than across the rest of England & Wales . Trump went on: \"My mother loved London, she loved that city...but it's a different London than you have today. Today you have people being stabbed in the ass. Or worse. But no it's crazy. Your mayor is a disaster. I don't even know him. If you put him there I wouldn't even know who he was. I can tell you he's a disaster. He's a nasty person. And he's letting crime go.\" He went on to repeat claims widely spread by far-right and white supremacist groups in the UK that there are \"no-go\" areas for the police in London, and areas where so-called Sharia Law has supplanted British law. Neither of these claims is true. You can read the full story here Donald Trump says he will sue the BBC for between one and five billion dollars over the increasingly preposterous Panorama editing row. And he falsely claimed not to have spoken the words used in the programme at all. But the broadcaster indicated it would not pay him damages over the programme, which did not air in the US. \"We'll sue them for anywhere between a billion and five billion dollars, probably sometime next week,\" Trump told a reporter on Air Force One on his way to Florida. \"I think I have to do it, they even admit that they cheated. Not that they wouldn't not have done that. They changed the words coming out of my mouth. That's worse than what CBS did with Kamala.\" This is untrue. None of the speech elements the BBC broadcast were fabricated. All of them were complete sentences spoken by the President during his January 6th 2021 speech. Countless courts, plus the US House of Representative agreed that Trump's speech played a role in inciting violence on what became a bloody insurrection at the US capitol shortly after the speech. Full story here Trump also appeared to suggest in the GB News interview, broadcast later, that the BBC had manipulated the footage to make his voice say things that he did not say. This is also untrue. The phrases used in the broadcast were from different parts of the speech, but they were not invented. \"The word fake is one thing but this is beyond fake, what they did. The lawyers walked in and said: \"sir, you're not going to believe this...\" They showed me the one, and then they showed me the other. And it's not even ...it's different words. It looks like even the same mouth movement. Who even would be able to even find ...somebody did an amazing job to be able to...but it's a totally different meaning and totally different words.\" He added: \"[CBS] changed [Kamala Harris'] answer but at least they didn't show it coming out of her mouth.\" Trump went on: \"The people of the UK are very angry about what happened, as you can imagine, because it shows the BBC is fake news.\" Asked if he'd raised the issue with Keir Starmer, he said: \"I haven't but I'll call him. He actually put a call in to me, because he's very embarrassed.\" Trump says the MRI he had during his recent visit to Walter Reed medical centre is a totally normal and completely routine element of a physical, saying: \"What you think I shouldn't get it? Other people get it.\" Reader, it is not. He went on to say he had no idea which part of his body was being examined in the scan, only that \"the doctor said it was the best result he has ever seen. The result was outstanding.\" Which led to this brutal question from a reporter: \"Was it your brain?\"","summary":"In one of the newsiest Friday nights of Donald Trump's second Presidency, he broke up with a huge MAGA icon, blasted Phantom of the Opera on the White House terrace and confirmed the real reason for his MRI scan","url":"https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/mikey-smith-11-unhinged-donald-36252514","image":"https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/article36252526.ece/ALTERNATES/s1200b/0_President-Trump-Spends-Weekend-At-Mar-A-Lago-Estate-In-Florida.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 15:42:14","author":"Mikey Smith","authors":["Mikey Smith"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.267},{"id":379315196,"title":"BBC Edits Trump; Trump Still The Villain","text":"Authored by Jenna McCarthy via Jenna's Side Substack,\n\nRemember that fateful January day when the sitting President of the United States ordered all his angry, disappointed supporters to rush down to the Capitol—where they were busy certifying his opponent’s stolen Electoral College victory—and fight like hell? I mean, that was bold. Crazy, even. It almost sounded as if he was inciting violence.\n\nExcept—tiny plot twist—he didn’t say that. I know, you saw it all over the news and everything, but what he actually said was, “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women.”\n\nSlightly different ring, no?\n\nBut let’s be honest; “Go, Congress!” makes a lousy lead-in to a Trump Spurs an Insurrection story. So when the BBC was putting together a little pre-election documentary about the famed day, they decided to rewrite the script. They grabbed that “walk down to the Capitol” line, snatched a completely different quote from nearly an hour later in his speech (notably, “We fight, we fight like hell”), and then chopped out everything in between—including peacefully and patriotically, in case anyone’s keeping track.\n\nThe result? Oh, just a bunch of mostly benign words being rearranged into a call to arms. No big deal.\n\n@flufrstf #BBC #Jan6 #Trump ♬ original sound - FlufferstuffTheBlameless\n\nIt’s bad enough that a once respected media outlet was so blatant in their bias. It’s humiliating that they were busted, hilarious that they think anyone will believe it was accidental, and egregious that their journalistic PR-wrangling cronies are actually trying to defend them. But the fact that, even after the BBC issued an apology and an admission of guilt, the rest of the media mafia is trying to spin this into Orange Man Attacks Journalists is almost too much to take.\n\nTHE BBC, BASICALLY: “Look, editing is hard. Who among us hasn’t unknowingly rearranged someone’s words to mean the exact opposite of what they actually said? It’s called craft. You wouldn’t understand.”\n\nBut, you see, Trump is the bad guy here, because he didn’t just notice; he said something. Actually, he didn’t just say something, he filed a lawsuit. A big-with-a-B (as in billion-dollar) lawsuit.\n\n“They actually changed my January 6 speech, which was a beautiful speech, which was a very calming speech, and they made it sound radical,” Trump said. “I think I have an obligation to [proceed with legal action], because you can’t allow people to do that.”\n\nAnd even though the BBC admitted they were in the wrong, even though two of their top executives promptly escorted themselves out of the building in the wake of the editing scandal, and even though the “documentary” has now been confirmed to be about as honest as a reality TV reunion… the true crime, according to the press, is, well, Trump.\n\nWhatever you say, Guardian.\n\n“There’s a political context to this attack—and it is an attack—it’s a concerted full-frontal assault on the BBC for what was absolutely an editorial mistake,” said broadcaster Steven Barnett. “It’s the kind of mistake that is easily accounted for, easily apologized for… and once you see that program, you will realize that that edit made absolutely no difference to the overall impartiality of that biography of Donald Trump leading up to the 2024 presidential election.”\n\nSo, just so we’re clear: “news” outlets are now accusing politicians of “weaponizing editing errors”—as if asking journalists and editors not to remix speeches like a bad rap track is some unreasonable, dictator-level request and not basic kindergarten fairness. It would be like your teenager admitting they were texting when they wrecked the car—then accusing you of “holding it against them” when you won’t pay for the repairs.\n\nThe subtext of the coverage is basically: How dare the peasants expect accuracy?\n\nFrom StopTrump.org.uk, because of course.\n\nAnd the BBC saga is only one chapter in the Media Bias scrapbook. CBS had to quietly settle a $16 million lawsuit because 60 Minutes edited Kamala Harris’ answers so creatively that she actually appeared intelligent. Kristi Noem accused Face the Nation of “whitewashing the truth” by selectively chopping out entire chunks of her replies, to which the network sheepishly responded by announcing they’d now only air full, unedited interviews. Apparently they realize their editing bay is a lawless frontier where any sentence might wake up missing an organ.\n\nRegardless, every headline still finds a way to imply Trump is the problem. The BBC admitted it Frankensteined his speech. Editors resigned. The entire world noticed. But the narrative is,\n\nNo, kids. The weapon was forged when newsrooms decided that “shortening clips for time” included playing God with context. Trump is merely the first person with the resources (and the pettiness… and the cojones) to fire back.\n\nPoor, tortured journalists lament that they’re being scrutinized “more than ever.” Yes. Yes, you are. Because it turns out when people discover you’ve been editing interviews like they’re Hollywood trailers instead of news broadcasts, they realize you’re not journalists—you’re screenwriters.\n\n“I would call this a big screw-up, a big journalistic screw-up, but in a very small, narrow way, because it was one small part of a long documentary, and most importantly, because nobody seemed to notice it at the time,” said CNN’s Brian Stelter.\n\nOh, well, nobody noticed it at the time? I guess we’re good.\n\nOne editor quoted by the AP complains that every cut is now “under a microscope.” Good. If you can stitch together two unrelated fragments of a presidential speech like a Build-A-Bear, you deserve a microscope, a spotlight, and possibly a babysitter.\n\nMy favorite part is the quiet panic underlying all these articles: the realization that normal people, armed with transcripts and internet access, can now compare what aired to what was actually said. In 1992, that would’ve required a team of interns and a sacrifice to the gods of VHS. Today, it’s a Tuesday morning for any bored guy on Reddit.\n\nThe media in a meme.\n\nNo wonder the press is stressed. The era of “trust us, it’s fine, this is totally what they said—er, meant” is over. When you make a living off deception, that’s bad news. But sure, mainstream media. Tell us more about how you’re the real victims here.","url":"https://www.zerohedge.com/markets/bbc-edits-trump-trump-still-villain","image":"https://assets.zerohedge.com/s3fs-public/styles/16_9_max_700/public/2025-11/2025-11-14_12-21-11.jpg?h=80aeffff&amp;itok=aLCjPfLr","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 15:30:00","author":"Tyler Durden","authors":["Tyler Durden"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.504},{"id":379314266,"title":"How Trump has tried to sue the media for more than $30,000,000,000 – with drastically different results","text":"To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web\n browser that\n supports HTML5\n video\n\n Up Next\n\n Previous Page\n\n Next Page\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nDonald Trump has threatened again to sue the BBC for up to $5billion over the editing of his speeches on Panorama.\n\nThe BBC has now complied with two out of three demands laid out by the White House, including a personal apology to Trump for the ‘error of judgement’ from chairman Samir Shah.\n\nThe scandal also brought down the Corporation’s director-general, Tim Davie and CEO of news, Deborah Turness.\n\nHowever Trump has said he will pursue charges against the broadcaster for making ‘false, defamatory, disparaging, and inflammatory statements’.\n\nIt is just the latest in a long series of disputes between the president and media firms, journalists and writers, from CNN to his own niece.\n\nWhile many have bowed to his demands and reached settlements, many of Trump’s challenges have been thrown out by judges.\n\nSince his first term in office, the president has sued the press for more than $30billion altogether, with his demands for financial compensation significantly increasing since returning to office in January.\n\n Trump has threatened to sue the BBC for up to $5billion (Picture: AP)\n\nTrump vs ABC\n\nIn 2017, Trump launched proceedings against ABC News over claims made by political commentator George Stephanopoulos that he had ‘raped’ author E. Jean Carroll.\n\nA jury returned a technical verdict of ‘sexual abuse’ rather than rape.\n\nFollowing a seven-year battle in December 2024, ABC’s parent, the Walt Disney Company, announced it had reached an agreement to donate $15million to the Trump Presidential Library on top another $1million in legal costs.\n\nClash with CBS\n\nTrump demanded $20billion (doubled from an initial $10billion) after accusing CBS News of deceitfully manipulating an interview with Kamala Harris to hinder his electoral prospects prior to the 2024 contest.\n\nThe channel had released two versions of Harris’s broadcast on the 60 minutes programme.\n\nCBS denied it had deceptively edited Harris’s interview, which it insisted had been clipped down due to time constraints.\n\nIn July, the channel’s parent firm Paramount, said it had agreed to a $16billion settlement paid to Trump’s presidential library including legal fees.\n\nHowever the company said the settlement did not include any statement of regret or apology.\n\n The president has claimed more than $30billion in damages from news organisations in a range of defamation lawsuits (Picture: AP)\n\nStandoffs against the New York Times\n\nIn 2020, Trump’s reelection campaign sued both the New York Times and the Washington Post over claims made in opinion pieces about the president’s alleged connections with Russia.\n\nBoth lawsuits were thrown out by judges in 2021 and 2023 respectively.\n\nThe same year Trump filed a separate lawsuit against the NYT, three of its reporters and his own niece, Mary L Trump.\n\nHe accused the newspaper and his reporters of an ‘insidious plot’ to convince Mary Trump to ‘smuggle out’ his tax records.\n\nDespite pledging to publish his tax details during his 2016 campaign, Trump never disclosed the records, citing an ongoing audit into his finances.\n\nHowever the $100million lawsuit was thrown out by a judge who ruled that the president’s case had failed ‘as a matter of constitutional law’.\n\n Can Trump really sue the BBC? \n\n Robert Spritzer, an American political scientist and author, told Metro that the statute of limitations in terms of when such a suit could be filed in Britain has passed.\nThis means that if this suit goes forward, it would likely be filed in an American court, where the statute of limitations doesn’t apply.Spritzer argues that the key to understanding Trump is realising litigation is one of his chief weapons that he’s used for decades.\n‘He utilised it in thousands of cases while he was a businessman and before he entered politics. And the point is not necessarily to win lawsuits. In Trump’s case, it is less about winning than it is generating publicity that he views as favourable to himself, to harass whoever it is that he is suing, to ratchet up the anxiety for the individuals or organisations that he is suing.’\nSpritzer says lawsuits of this calibre could be considered a SLAPP lawsuit – a lawsuit to essentially harass, to provide bad publicity. And Trump has had some success with lawsuits against American media organisations.\nRead Metro’s full analysis piece here\n\nThe Wall Street Journal Epstein letter\n\nTrump launched a lawsuit against the Rupert Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal following its publication of a letter sent by him to convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThe ‘bawdy’ message, sent as part of a book collated for Epstein’s 50th birthday in 2003, before he was charged with sex abuse, including a drawing of a naked woman.\n\nIt contained the words: ‘A pal is a wonderful thing. Happy Birthday – and may every day be a wonderful secret.’\n\nBut Trump branded the message ‘a fake thing’, insisting that it couldn’t have been his because he couldn’t draw and sought $10billion in damages from reporters, executives and even Murdoch himself.\n\nDow Jones, the company behind WSJ, said it had ‘full confidence’ in the accuracy of its reporting.\n\n Trump’s demands for damage compensation have significantly increased since his re-election (Picture: Getty Images North America)\n\n2024 election lawsuits\n\nIn another clash with a major news firm, Trump sought $15billion in damages from the New York Times and Penguin Random House over three stories published within a month of the 2024 presidential election.\n\nHis complaint also cited a book written by the paper’s journalists Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig, which he said attempted to tarnish his reputation as a businessman and harm his election campaign.\n\nAfter his original case was thrown out on procedural grounds, Trump refiled his lawsuit last month.\n\nThe NYT said in a statement that the president’s claims had ‘no merit’ and were an attempt to ‘stifle independent reporting and generate PR attention’.\n\nCNN ‘big lie’ lawsuit\n\nTrump has had many clashes with CNN, including repeatedly branding its coverage ‘fake news’ and refusing to answer questions from its reporters.\n\nThe icy relationship with the broadcaster came to a head after the president sued the network for defamation after it used the term ‘big lie’ to describe his denial of his 2021 election defeat.\n\nSeeking $475million in damages, Trump said he had been likened to Adolf Hitler, however the channel insisted that its use of the phrase did not infer he had invoked a genocide on Jews.\n\nThe lawsuit was thrown out by Trump appointee Judge Raag Singhal in July 2023, who concluded that use of the phrase did not meet the criteria for defamation.\n\nGet in touch with our news team by emailing us at webnews@metro.co.uk.\n\nFor more stories like this, check our news page.","summary":"","url":"https://metro.co.uk/2025/11/15/trump-v-press-president-sued-media-30billion-24714990/","image":"https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEC_274418826-8611.jpg?quality=90&strip=all","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 15:23:06","author":"Ryan Prosser","authors":["Ryan Prosser"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.249},{"id":379346200,"title":"Trump&apos;s BBC Defamation Lawsuit Threat Faces Legal Hurdles","text":"President Donald Trump, unswayed by the BBC’s apology and resignations of its top officials, is persisting with his threat to sue the network for as much as $5 billion despite significant legal barriers to prove he was deliberately defamed. \n\n“I think I have to do it,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on Friday, continuing his quest to punish the British television network over an edit of his Jan. 6, 2021, speech that made it seem he was directly calling for violence at the US Capitol.\n\nThe effort faces a host of legal questions. \n\nFirst, it’s not clear that US courts even have jurisdiction, given that the documentary never aired in the US and was geo-blocked in the US on the BBC’s streaming service.\n\nThe president would also need to prove that the BBC had acted with “actual malice” toward him when it edited the documentary — a high bar required for public figures that was established by the US Supreme Court in 1964 in order to protect free speech.\n\n“They’ve got to meet the actual malice standard with New York Times versus Sullivan, which is a very tough standard,” said Gregory Germain, a professor at Syracuse University College of Law. Trump is “the ultimate public figure.”\n\nTrump’s lawyer said in a Nov. 9 letter to the British Broadcasting Corp. that it had until Friday evening to issue an apology, retract the Panorama documentary at the center of the dispute and offer financial compensation for “harm caused” — or face a $1 billion defamation lawsuit.\n\n“The damages he asked for were completely unrealistic and he would be very unlikely to recover anywhere near that,” said Lyrissa Lidsky, a professor at University of Florida Levin College of Law. “He’s claiming reputational harm but he won the presidency afterwards.”\n\nThe BBC met some of Trump’s demands on Thursday when it issued a formal apology and retracted the broadcast, titled “Trump: A Second Chance,” which aired a week before the 2024 presidential election. That followed the surprise resignations of BBC Director-General Tim Davie and head of news Deborah Turness days earlier. But no compensation was offered.\n\n‘Sincerely Regrets’\n\n“While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim,” the broadcaster said in a statement.\n\nThe White House referred a request to comment to Trump’s lawyer, Alejandro Brito, who didn’t immediately respond to an email.\n\nOn Thursday, after the BBC apology, a spokesman for Trump’s legal team said “It is now clear that BBC engaged in a pattern of defamation against President Trump by intentionally and deceitfully editing his historic speech in order to try and interfere in the Presidential Election.”\n\nThe BBC’s editing spliced together two parts of Trump’s speech before the riot in a way that gave the impression of a direct call for violence. While more than a thousand Trump supporters invaded the Capitol building, injuring 140 police officers and causing millions of dollars in damage, his speech never directly called for the attack.\n\nThe time limit for filing defamation lawsuits in the UK is one year, meaning it’s too late for Trump to sue there. His lawyer has said the suit will be filed in Florida.\n\nFighting the Media\n\nThe case, if filed, would also have to surmount another legal standard that protects publications that are “substantially true,” Germain said. The remarks that were spliced together were both things Trump said, even if the edit was poorly done, he said.\n\n“I don’t think they should win a Pulitzer Prize for the editing, but it’s not defamatory,” Germain said. “What he’s alleging is that he doesn’t like the way they edited the video, he’s not alleging that they posted a deep fake or something.”\n\nA lawsuit against the BBC would add to a growing list of complaints Trump has filed against news outlets he claims have treated him unfairly, including recent multi-billion cases he has pending against the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, both of which deny wrongdoing.\n\nCBS agreed to pay $16 million to settle Trump’s suit accusing it of election interference over how the network’s 60 Minutes edited a quote from an interview with presidential candidate Kamala Harris, which he claimed smoothed out a meandering answer. ABC paid a similar amount to settle a suit over news host George Stephanopoulos’s incorrect reference to Trump being “found liable for rape” in a suit by E. Jean Carroll, while the jury had only found him liable for sexual abuse. The jury had rejected Carroll’s rape claim.\n\nBenjamin Zipursky, a professor at Fordham Law School in New York, said a lawsuit by Trump against the BBC would likely fail because the Supreme Court has long recognized “the importance of not chilling political speech with the threat of lawsuits.”\n\n“It’s the entire foundation of the Supreme Court’s protection of free speech that threats of costly lawsuits could cause the media to censor itself, and this case is a dramatic example of that,” Zipursky said.","url":"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-15/trump-s-threat-to-sue-bbc-over-speech-edit-faces-high-hurdles","image":"https://assets.bwbx.io/images/users/iqjWHBFdfxIU/izIAQTIo8fs4/v1/1200x800.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 15:20:16","author":"Erik Larson","authors":["Erik Larson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.282},{"id":379339440,"title":"'We ain't ready.'

More than 7.3 million Californians, or 64.3% of voters, supported the ballot measure that redraws the state’s congressional lines for the next three elections, starting in 2026.\n\nZooming into Orange County — where, according to the latest tally from the registrar of voters on Friday evening, Nov. 14, 553,856, or 55.47%, ballots were cast in favor of redistricting — the heaviest support for Proposition 50 came from voters in and around Anaheim, Irvine and Santa Ana.\n\nThe greatest opposition came from coastal communities, including Dana Point, Huntington Beach and San Clemente, as well as precincts in Orange, San Juan Capistrano, Yorba Linda and unincorporated places in South County. Voters in Newport Beach, which is split into two different congressional districts under the measure, most strongly opposed the measure.\n\nAnd if you consider Proposition 50 to be a referendum on President Donald Trump, it makes sense how Orange County voters decided on the measure.\n\nIn the 2024 presidential election, 49.7% of Orange County voters chose former Vice President Kamala Harris, whereas 47.1% chose Trump. Four years earlier, 53.5% of voters picked Biden compared to the 44.4% who cast ballots for Trump. And in 2016, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton nabbed 50.9% of the vote in Orange County; Trump then got 42.3%.\n\n“If you correlate the vote share for Donald Trump and the vote share for Proposition 50, you’ll get a strong correlation,” said Fred Smoller, a political scientist who teaches at Chapman University.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom and the campaigns in favor of Proposition 50 told voters that a “yes” vote was a way they could counter Trump and his policies — as well as Republican-backed efforts to gerrymander in other states, at the behest of the president, that could benefit the GOP in the upcoming midterms.\n\n“Orange County has changed,” Smoller added, noting it’s no longer a place that unequivocally backs Republicans on the ballot. “The post-war generation of White, older men in the military are exiting the electorate, and they’re being replaced by younger people and people of color, particularly Hispanics.”\n\nThe election results thus far “confirms the evidence that Orange County is very much a purple county,” said Louis DeSipio, who teaches political science at UC Irvine.\n\nStill, DeSipio threw a bit of an asterisk on any analysis of results: “Off-year elections are weird, and off, off-year elections are even weirder. This may not reflect what’s going to happen in 2026 or 2028.”\n\n“These (voters) are the truly committed who turned out for the election. We’ll see future competition for the presidency and gubernatorial races here in Orange County,” said DeSipio.\n\nThe Trump administration and California Republicans have filed a lawsuit to invalidate the new maps and force California to use those previously drawn by the state’s independent commission for the 2026 midterms and subsequent elections. They argue, in the lawsuit, that the maps were drawn to favor Hispanic voters and that racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional.\n\nCounty elections officials have until Dec. 4 to complete their official tally of results. The California secretary of state will certify the election results on Dec. 12.","summary":"If you consider Proposition 50 to be a referendum on President Donald Trump, it makes sense how Orange County voters decided on the measure.","url":"https://www.ocregister.com/2025/11/15/see-how-your-orange-county-neighborhood-voted-on-proposition-50/","image":"https://www.ocregister.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/LDN-PROP50-1105-01-LO.jpg?w=1600&resize=1600,900","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 15:00:30","author":"Daniel Aitken,Kaitlyn Schallhorn","authors":["Daniel Aitken","Kaitlyn Schallhorn"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.108},{"id":379310344,"title":"Trump Targets MTG with a New Nickname","text":"The ongoing verbal tussle between Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated as Trump unleashed one of his infamous derogatory nicknames on the Congresswoman. Their heated exchange extended into a second day, keeping political observers on the edge of their seats.\n\nOn Saturday morning, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, shortly after Greene issued a composed statement. In his post, Trump derisively referred to the Georgia Representative as “Marjorie Taylor Brown,” suggesting, “Green grass turns Brown when it begins to ROT!”\n\nHe didn’t stop there. In a subsequent post, Trump dubbed her “Marjorie Traitor Greene,” accusing her of betraying the Republican Party by shifting towards the left. Trump’s rhetoric was as fiery as ever, painting Greene as just another “Fake politician.”\n\nHe went on to draw comparisons between Greene and other Republican figures, mentioning Rand Paul Jr. and Thomas Massie, whom he labeled as a “Republican In Name Only (RINO).” Trump punctuated his critique with a rallying cry for his supporters, “MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!”\n\nThe discord reached a significant point on Friday when Trump announced he was retracting his support for Greene, dismissing her as “a ranting lunatic.” This move signaled a stark shift in Trump’s stance towards the once-favored MAGA advocate.\n\nThe president announced on Friday that he was withdrawing his support of the former MAGA darling, saying she was ‘a ranting lunatic’.\n\nGreene fired back by sharing screenshots of texts she sent to Trump about the importance of the Epstein files, causing an all-out MAGA civil war.\n\nShe joins the likes of ‘Sleepy Joe Biden’, ‘Crazy Hillary’, ‘Ron DeSanctimonious’, and ‘Lyin’ Kamala Harris’, who have all been given their own nickname by Trump. \n\nPrior to his put down of Greene on Saturday, she took to social media to offer her thanks to those who had reached out in support of her after the explosive events of the night before.\n\nShe said: ‘I want to thank everyone who texted and posted and commented support for me, you all are so kind and I appreciate, love, and support you too. \n\n‘I never thought that fighting to release the Epstein files, defending women who were victims of rape, and fighting to expose the web of rich powerful elites would have caused this, but here we are. And it truly speaks for itself. \n\n‘There needs to be a new way forward. The toxic political industrial complex thrives on ripping us all apart but never delivers anything good for the American people, whom I love. \n\n‘The PIC tells us to hate each other, fundraises off why we have to hate each other, and pits Americans against each other to the point of violence and nearing civil war. This is all so wrong. \n\n‘We can have our own differences and differing opinions but we can still love and respect one another. \n\nWe have far more in common than we have apart. I believe in the American people more than I believe in any leader or political party and the American people deserve so much better than how they have been treated by both sides of the aisle. \n\n‘The way forward is America First America Only. And that may be the most dangerous pursuit of all.’\n\nGreene and Trump traded social media barbs on Friday, with Greene sharing screenshots of texts she sent to Trump about the Epstein files. \n\nTrump kickstarted the spat – including an admission that he advised her not to run for Senate in 2026 – on Truth Social earlier that evening. \n\nShe advised him to ‘lean in’ to former President Bill Clinton’s connections to the pedophile, Trump ordered an investigation into Clinton on Friday. \n\n‘Epstein was the spider that wove the web of the deep state. Lean into it,’ she said. \n\nIn a second screenshot, Greene responded to a text from ‘NH’ that appeared to be fuming about her Trump criticisms, stating: ‘THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN HOAX.’\n\nGreene replied: ‘In every single interview I have done I have defended President Trump. \n\n‘I’ve said over and over the women say he did nothing wrong and their attorney says he’s the only one who helped. \n\n‘And the Democrats had 4 years to release the files but did nothing’, NH is an apparent reference to the president’s assistant Natalie Harp.\n\nGreene adds: ‘Stop ignoring the women. Many of them literally voted for President Trump and say so publicly. Them being raped as teenagers is not a hoax.’\n\nIn a lengthy statement on Friday, she said Trump was specifically gunning for her to scare other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files. \n\nShe added: ‘It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level.’ \n\nGreene said she had given Trump ‘too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him’ when others abandoned him.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nThe ongoing verbal tussle between Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene escalated&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Targets MTG with a New Nickname first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/trump-targets-mtg-with-a-new-nickname/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Trump-gives-MTG-one-of-his-trademark-insulting-nicknames.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 14:28:31","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.11},{"id":379368644,"title":"Taylor Swift’s silence on the Trump administration using her music speaks volumes","text":"The person I voted for had always won.

The BBC has apologized to Trump for the edit but said it had not defamed him and would not pay financial compensation. The broadcaster's director-general and head of news both resigned in the wake of the incident. “We’ll sue them for anywhere between $1bn and $5bn, probably sometime next week,” Trump said, speaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday evening. “I think I have to do it,” he added. “They cheated. They changed the words coming out of my mouth.” The controversy centers on BBC show \"Panorama\" editing together two distant moments from Trump’s 6 January 2021 speech — his call to supporters to walk to the Capitol and, over 50 minutes later, his line “We fight. We fight like hell”— creating the impression they were spoken consecutively. Trump’s lawyers had given the corporation a deadline of Friday to issue a retraction, an apology and agree to pay compensation. The BBC did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment following Trump's latest remarks. The BBC published a correction Thursday evening, saying it accepted the edit “gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,” and said it would not be broadcast again. BBC Chair Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House saying that he and the corporation were sorry for the edit, a spokesperson said, adding that while it “sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.” Tony Hall, director-general of the BBC from 2013 to 2020, said Saturday that the corporation should never agree to pay any money to Donald Trump. \"You’re talking about public money,\" he said in an interview with the BBC. \"It would not be appropriate.” Trump said in an interview earlier on Friday that he had an “obligation” to sue the corporation. “This is beyond fake. This is corrupt,” he told rival British broadcaster GB News. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Wednesday that the BBC must “get their house in order” when mistakes are made, but expressed his support for the broadcaster. “The BBC must uphold the highest standards, be accountable and correct errors quickly,” he told the House of Commons. “But I will always stand up for a strong, independent BBC.” Trump said Friday that he had not raised the issue with Starmer but that the prime minister had asked to speak to him, and that he would call the British leader over the weekend. Director-General Tim Davie, along with news chief Deborah Turness, quit the BBC last week, saying the scandal was damaging the BBC and “as the CEO of BBC News and Current Affairs, the buck stops with me.” U.K. Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said Friday there was a “real concern” that political appointments to the BBC’s board had damaged trust in the corporation after a series of scandals, adding she would be examining the issue as part of the corporation’s next charter review. Trump has won lucrative settlements against U.S. media companies. In July, Paramount announced it had settled a lawsuit brought by Trump that had accused CBS News’ “60 Minutes” of airing an edited clip of an interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris that Trump said unduly affected the 2024 election.","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/united-kingdom/trump-bbc-lawsuit-apology-speech-edits-rcna244082","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2025-11/251115-trump-nd-689061.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 13:51:55","author":"Freddie Clayton","authors":["Freddie Clayton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.478},{"id":379289218,"title":"Republicans have lost ground with Latino voters after Trump’s 2024 gains","text":"A year after President Donald Trump’s re-election, Republicans are already seeing their gains among Latino voters erode, recent election results and polling suggest. Here’s what’s changed and what it could mean for next year’s midterm elections. Economic angst drove Latino voters toward the GOP in 2024 Trump made considerable inroads with Latino voters in 2024, losing this group by just 5 points nationally after losing by 38 and 33 points in 2016 and 2020, respectively, according to CNN’s 2024 exit poll. Analyses by Catalist and the Pew Research Center also found a close race among Latinos last year. Trump’s relatively strong performance came amid a wave of economic discontent. CNN’s exit poll found that Latino voters were more likely than any other racial or ethnic group to select the economy as their top issue and to describe inflation as a severe or moderate hardship. They were the least likely to say their financial situation had improved since 2020. Latinos overwhelmingly disapprove of Trump’s second term so far Many Latinos entered Trump’s second term feeling optimistic. Over half approved of his handling of the presidential transition in a December 2024 CNN poll, a similar proportion described themselves as enthusiastic or optimistic about his second term, and 72% expressed at least some confidence in his ability to handle the economy. But in CNN’s latest poll, just 20% of Latinos approved of his job performance, down from 41% in February. This 21-point drop far outpaces the 4- and 9-point drops among Black and White Americans and the 10-point drop in his approval rating overall. Several other polls have also found Trump’s approval rating among Latinos declining from the start of his second term. This drop in approval comes as Latinos continue to be focused on the economy: In the late October poll, 54% say the economy and cost of living is the nation’s top issue (compared to 47% for Americans overall). Latinos are more likely than Americans overall to rate economic conditions as somewhat or very poor (81%, compared to 72% of all Americans) and to say Trump’s policies have worsened economic conditions (75%, compared to 61% of all Americans). Latinos are also likelier than the general population to say that immigration is extremely or very important to them (77% said so in CNN’s late summer poll, compared to 65% of Americans overall). From July to October, the proportion of Latinos who say that Trump has gone too far on deportations has gone up from 66% to 79%. Since March, the Republican Party’s favorability rating among Latinos has dropped from 26% to 16%, while the Democratic Party’s rating has mostly held steady, going from 37% to 34%. And by late summer, Latinos gave Democrats a 10-point advantage on economic issues, up from a near-even split in May. In a statement, White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said that Trump “received historic support from Latino voters in the 2024 election” and was beginning to fulfill his promises on the economy and immigration. “President Trump has consistently outperformed the mainstream media’s so-called polling, and he will continue doing so by delivering for everyday Americans,” Jackson said. Democrats won Latinos in this month’s elections by wide margins In the first opportunity for millions of Americans to weigh in on Trump’s second term, Latinos supported Abigail Spanberger and Mikie Sherrill, the Democratic candidates for governor in Virginia and New Jersey respectively, by at least a 2-to-1 margin, according to CNN’s exit poll. Latinos also voted for a Democratic-supported redistricting ballot measure in California 71% to 29%. There have been questions about Democrats’ ability to win back Latino voters given their own popularity issues. (CNN’s most recent polling found that more Latinos view the party unfavorably than favorably.) The Latinos who voted in the November 2025 contests generally held favorable views of the Democratic Party – 56% in California and Virginia and 67% in New Jersey said they viewed the party favorably. Democrats were also better able than Republicans to win over Latino voters who viewed their respective parties negatively. Voters in California who viewed both parties negatively supported the Democratic-backed ballot measure 78% to 21%. In Virginia and New Jersey, just 2% of Latino voters who held a negative view of the Republican Party supported Winsome Earle-Sears or Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican gubernatorial candidates, while over a third who held a negative view of the Democratic Party across the two contests cast votes for the Democratic candidates. Democrats’ strong performance among Latinos on November 4 was not solely the result of more Democratic-leaning Latino voters turning out. Mirroring the Latino disillusionment with Trump’s presidency, Latino Trump voters also appear to have defected from Trump at higher rates than the overall electorate. Among Latino voters who turned out in the November 2025 elections and said they had supported Trump last year, 24% in California voted for the Democratic-supported ballot measure and 18% in New Jersey supported Sherrill. The defection rates were considerably lower among all Trump voters who turned out in 2025: 12% in California supported the ballot measure and 7% in New Jersey voted for Sherrill. What this year’s results could mean for 2026 While the 2025 contests represent a relatively narrow and Democratic-leaning playing field, early polling on the 2026 midterms also shows Democrats gaining ground. CNN’s October poll found that Latino registered voters say, 64% to 19%, that they’d prefer a Democratic congressional candidate over a Republican one. And 60% say there’s no chance they’d consider supporting a Republican candidate, while just 19% say they’ve ruled out backing a Democrat. An October Washington Post-ABC News-Ipsos poll found a narrower but still substantial lead for Democrats among Latino voters – in that poll, 52% said they’d prefer a Democratic congressional candidate and 35% a Republican one. CNN’s latest polling suggests that Democrats are currently holding onto more Latino voters who chose Democrat Kamala Harris last year than Republicans are holding onto Latino Trump voters. Among non-Latino voters, Democrats and Republicans are holding onto similar shares of their party’s voters.","url":"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/11/15/politics/trump-latino-voters","image":"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/c-gettyimages-2178756980.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 13:00:03","author":"Edward Wu","authors":["Edward Wu"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.553},{"id":379291084,"title":"Democrats’ ‘Principled Stand’ on the Shutdown Is an Attempt to Pay Back Their Health Insurance Donors","text":"The following content is sponsored by American Resolve.\n\nEver since the disaster of Obamacare was unleashed on the American public, our healthcare system has only gotten worse – except for the insurance companies, who bathed in massive profits thanks to their pal Obama. Some health insurance stocks are up 1,000 percent in the last 15 years, and even Obama’s cheerleaders at the New York Times called Obamacare a “blessing”!\n\nThis puts in the last piece of the puzzle as to why the Democrats dug in their heels so much on the longest shutdown in American history. The Democrats’ insistence on extending Obamacare subsidies is not some principled stand on behalf of any huddled masses yearning to breathe free: this is obstructionism to feed their donors’ profits.\n\nThe “follow the money” on this one is pretty straightforward. In the 2024 campaign, insurers gave five times more money to Kamala Harris than to Donald Trump. In the 2018 cycle, the industry gave 30 times as much to federal Democrat candidates as Republicans: $63 million to just $2.2 million.\n\nThis is the Democrats’ new playbook: pretend to champion the oppressed while cashing checks from the oppressors. Congressional Democrats were repaying their corporate donors by shutting down the government to keep $400 billion of taxpayer money flowing to insurance companies in Obamacare subsidies. Then of course that money comes back into Democrats’ coffers and the awful cycle keeps going.\n\nInsurance companies are betting that Democrats take the House next year, meaning it will be even easier to perpetuate this broken system.\n\nWhat may surprise you is that these enhanced subsidies were not part of the original legislation. Rather, these billions were sold as temporary COVID enhanced subsidies, and now Democrats and their insurance company overlords are trying to make them permanent. According to the nonpartisan Paragon Health Institute, the COVID enhanced subsidies make all the underlying problems with the original subsidies even worse. Insurers reportedly have been enrolling people without their knowledge in order to squeeze more cash out of the federal government, figuring that the system is so big they can get away with anything – and if anyone notices, they’ll shriek, “Won’t somebody please think of the children!”\n\nLooking at the Medicare Advantage Plans, you can see insurance companies overbilling by as much as $2 trillion in the next eight years, according to Federal auditors. Profit hungry companies like UnitedHealthcare are facing a federal investigation about their Medicare overbilling, which would threaten those eye-watering Obamacare profits. No wonder United, the biggest Obamacare insurer, donated $9 billion to AARP to help them keep the wheels as greased as possible. Imagine how many lives could have been saved or improved if that $9 billion had been spent helping patients in their retirement years?\n\nWhile this “principled stand” may help Democrats squeeze more money from insurance companies, it has not helped their popularity. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer broke the record for most unpopular national figure in the last 40 years of polling.\n\nIf Republicans do indeed agree to extend the COVID Obamacare subsidies, this olive leaf should come with the condition that insurers must pay for the privilege. They can certainly afford it.","summary":"Democrats were repaying their corporate donors by shutting down the government to keep billions of taxpayer money flowing to health insurance companies.\n\n\nThe post Democrats’ ‘Principled Stand’ on the Shutdown Is an Attempt to Pay Back Their Health Insurance Donors appeared first on Breitbart.","url":"https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/11/15/democrats-principled-stand-on-the-shutdown-is-an-attempt-to-pay-back-their-health-insurance-donors/","image":"https://media.breitbart.com/media/2025/11/ar-spc-11-17-25-640x335.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 12:50:49","author":"American Resolve","authors":["American Resolve"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.31},{"id":379268824,"title":"Setting the stage: What the 2025 elections signal for next year's midterm showdowns","text":"With the 2025 elections fading into the rearview mirror, the campaign spotlight moves 100% towards next year's midterm elections, when Republicans will be defending their fragile House majority and their control of the Senate. And as this month's elections showcased, the economy will once again be uppermost on the minds of voters. How both parties handle the 'affordability' issue will likely impact whether Republicans can regain their standing with female voters, and with Black and Latino voters, who swung towards the GOP in 2024 but who shifted back to the Democrats at the ballot box in this autumn's off-year elections. One year after deep concerns over inflation helped Republicans win back the White House and Senate and successfully protect their House majority, Democrats say their convincing double-digit victories in 2025's only two elections for governor came down to affordability, the issue they repeatedly spotlighted on this year's campaign trail. DEMOCRATS SEE MANDATE AFTER 2025 WINS — REPUBLICANS SAY IT'S A MIRAGE Democratic Governors Association Executive Director Meghan Meehan-Draper said that Rep. Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and former Rep. Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, the two Democratic gubernatorial nominees that overperformed the public opinion polls as they cruised to Election Night victories in the blue-leaning states, \"stayed laser focused on the economy,\" and \"talked about it all day, every day.\" It was also the issue that boosted a one-time longshot, socialist Zohran Mandani, to an initial victory in New York City's Democratic Party mayoral primary, and another win in the mayoral election in the nation's most populous city. The numbers appear to back the Democrats up. According to the Fox News Voter Poll conducted Oct. 22 through Election Day, the economy was by far the top issue for Virginia voters — with close to half ranking it as the most important. Those voters broke significantly for Spanberger. And in New Jersey, the economy was the second most pressing issue, following taxes, according to the poll. And Sherrill won those voters by a 30-point margin. KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM THE 2025 ELECTIONS Pointing to the big wins for Democrats in New Jersey and Virginia, as well as in battleground Pennsylvania and left-tilting New York City and California, and battleground Georgia, Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin said his party's candidates \"are meeting voters at the kitchen table... From New Jersey and Virginia and New York, to Georgia and beyond, Democrats ran campaigns relentlessly focused on costs and affordability.\" And pointing to those victories, as well as down-ballot wins in a slew of other states, Martin touted \"it was an unequivocal Blue Sweep.\" Republicans argue that Democrats are overplaying their victories in the 2025 elections. \"What happened last night was blue states and blue cities voted blue. We all saw that coming. And no one should read too much into last night’s election results,\" House Speaker Mike Johnson said the day after the elections.Vice President JD Vance, in a social media post last week, said, \"I think it's idiotic to overreact to a couple of elections in blue states.\" VANCE DELIVERS POST-ELECTION REALITY CHECK, CONTENDS GOP MUST MAKE LIFE AFFORDABLE OR GET WALLOPED IN 2026 But Vance acknowledged that when it comes to the economy and specifically inflation, \"We're going to keep on working to make a decent life affordable in this country, and that's the metric by which we'll ultimately be judged in 2026 and beyond.\" In an appearance Thursday on Fox News' \"Hannity,\" the vice president, pointing to former President Joe Biden's tenure in the White House, charged that \"we inherited a disaster. We're very mindful of the fact that there's a lot of work to do, but I think that we've made great progress.\" President Donald Trump, in his first post-2025 election interview, told Fox News' Bret Baier on Wednesday that, on inflation, \"We've done so much… Energy is way down … We're going to have $2 gasoline. I did that. That brings everything else down. Groceries are way down, other than beef. Now, beef is going to come down … The fact is, we have prices way down.\" And the president argued in his \"Special Report\" interview that it's more of a messaging problem for the GOP. \"As Republicans, you have to talk about it,\" Trump said. The president has kept to his affordability script in repeated appearances since last week's elections, including during an interview on Fox News \"The Ingraham Angle.\" And on Friday, the president took to social media to claim, \"Affordability is a lie when used by the Dems. It is a complete CON JOB.\" But the focus on affordability appeared to pump the brakes on the GOP's major gains last year with key parts of the Democratic Party base. According to the Fox News Voter Poll, Sherrill captured the female vote in New Jersey by a 62%-37% margin, up from former Vice President Kamala Harris' 56%-42% margin last year. It was a similar story in Virginia, where Spanberger won women voters 65%-35%, up from the then-vice president's 57%-42% margin in 2024. One of the biggest stories in the 2024 elections was the gains Trump and Republicans made with Black and Latino voters. In New Jersey, Sherrill outperformed Harris' 2024 showing by 12 percentage points among Latino voters and by 15 points among Black voters. Spanberger also made gains compared to Harris, with an 8-point increase in support among Latino voters and 7 points among Black voters. \"Up and down the ballot, Black and Latino voters overwhelmingly broke for Democrats. Our candidates stayed laser-focused on the issue that matters most to voters, affordability,\" DNC Senior Spokesperson Marcus W. Robinson told Fox News Digital. Martin says the 2025 elections were a preview of things to come in next year's midterms. \"In ‘26, we’ll do it again. We’ll run a National Coordinated Campaign to win races up and down the ballot to provide a check on the out-of-control Trump administration and its Republican rubber stamps,\" he argued.

The party is fully aligned behind his America First agenda and the results he’s delivering for the American people. President Trump’s policies are popular, he drives turnout, and standing with him is the strongest path to victory,\" RNC National Press Secretary Kiersten Pels told Fox News Digital.","summary":"Democrats claim economy focus drove 2025 gubernatorial wins in New Jersey and Virginia, setting stage for 2026 midterm elections as affordability remains key voter issue.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/setting-stage-what-2025-elections-signal-next-years-midterm-showdowns","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/11/mikie-sherrill-votes.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 12:00:34","author":"Paul Steinhauser","authors":["Paul Steinhauser"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.127},{"id":379275600,"title":"Donald Trump says he will take legal action against the BBC over edited speech","text":"Speaking to reporters on board Air Force One, the US president said he would sue the corporation for “anywhere between 1 billion dollars (£759.8 million) and 5 billion dollars (£3.79 billion), probably sometime next week”. He had previously said he had an “obligation” to launch a billion-dollar lawsuit against the broadcaster, saying in an interview with Fox News that the BBC had “defrauded the public”. Speaking on Friday evening, he said: “I think I have to do it. They’ve even admitted that they cheated… They changed the words coming out of my mouth. “The people of the UK are very angry about what happened.” In a separate interview with GB News broadcast on Saturday, Mr Trump said: “I’m not looking to get into lawsuits, but I think I have an obligation to do it. “This was so egregious. If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people.” On Thursday, the BBC said the edit of Mr Trump’s speech on January 6 2021 had given the “mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action”. The broadcaster apologised and said the splicing of the speech was an “error of judgment” but refused to pay financial compensation after the president’s lawyers threatened to sue for one billion dollars in damages unless a retraction and apology were published. Chairman Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House to apologise for the editing, and lawyers for the corporation wrote to the president’s legal team, a BBC spokesperson said. The spokesperson added: “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.” Mr Trump told GB News he has had “a lot of success” litigating against news organisations. “Because it’s fake news,” he said. “But I’ve never had anything so fake as the BBC. “I’ve been doing this for a long time, I’ve never seen anything like (the BBC edit). That’s, that’s the most egregious. “I think that was worse than the Kamala (Harris) thing with CBS and 60 Minutes.” In July, US media giant Paramount agreed to pay Mr Trump 16 million dollars (£13.5 million) to settle a lawsuit over a 2024 CBS interview with Ms Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee. Mr Trump said his administration would be “finding out a lot of things over the next few months” through litigation. He said the lawsuit would “probably” be filed “someplace in the US”, but said that litigation in the UK “moves a little bit quickly”. He added that he would be speaking to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer over the weekend. The Panorama scandal prompted the resignations of two of the BBC’s most senior executives: director-general Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness. The programme, broadcast a week before the 2024 US election results, spliced two clips together so that Mr Trump appeared to tell the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol… and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.” The broadcaster said it will not air the Panorama episode Trump: A Second Chance? again, and published a retraction on the show’s webpage on Thursday. It said: “This programme was reviewed after criticism of how President Donald Trump’s 6th January 2021 speech was edited. “During that sequence, we showed excerpts taken from different parts of the speech. “However, we accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action. “The BBC would like to apologise to President Trump for that error of judgment.” A spokesperson added: “The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary Trump: A Second Chance? on any BBC platforms.” According to BBC News, the broadcaster set out five main arguments in its letter to Mr Trump’s legal team as to why it did not believe there was a basis for a defamation claim. It said the BBC did not distribute the Panorama episode on its US channels and was restricted on iPlayer to viewers in the UK; that the documentary did not cause Mr Trump harm as he was later re-elected; that the edit was not done with malice and was designed to shorten a long speech; that it was not meant to be considered in isolation but as part of an hour-long programme; and that an opinion on a matter of public concern and political speech is heavily protected under defamation laws in the US. On Thursday, reports said that the BBC faced separate accusations of misleading viewers about Mr Trump’s 2021 Capitol speech more than two years before the Panorama edit aired. In an episode broadcast in June 2022, Newsnight reportedly played an edited version of his speech, similar to the one used in the Panorama programme. A BBC spokesperson said about the fresh claims, reported by The Telegraph’s Daily T podcast: “The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards. This matter has been brought to our attention and we are now looking into it.”","summary":"Donald Trump has said he will sue the BBC next week after the corporation apologised but declined to compensate him for its edited version of a 2021 speech broadcast by Panorama.","url":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/news/national/donald-trump-says-he-will-take-legal-action-against-the-bbc-over-edited-speech-5403654","image":"https://www.newsletter.co.uk/webimg/b25lY21zOjkzYmYxYjFlLTFjYmUtNGY4MC1hNDgyLTk3M2M0NDIwNTRhMDpiZjA1NmE0ZC0xODA5LTRkNmMtYTRjZC00NmQzNzVjNDVkYzc=.jpg?width=1200&enable=upscale","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 12:00:00","author":"Jessica Coates","authors":["Jessica Coates"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.637},{"id":379279846,"title":"Taylor Swift’s silence on the Trump administration using her music speaks volumes | Alim Kheraj","text":"In the last two weeks, the Trump administration has used music from Taylor Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl, in three posts on social media. The first, shared by the official White House account on TikTok, was a patriotic slide show of images set to lead single The Fate of Ophelia. As Swift sings “pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes”, the video cuts to pictures of the US flag, President Trump, the vice-president, JD Vance, and the first and second ladies. The second and third were posted by Team Trump, the official account for the Trump Campaign. One, set to Father Figure, riffs on the lyric “this empire belongs to me” with the caption “this empire belongs to @President Donald J Trump”, while the other, celebrating Melania Trump winning something called the Patriot of the year award, is soundtracked by Opalite.\n\nThe Trump administration has found itself in dicey waters for using popular music in the past. The White Stripes and the estate of Isaac Hayes have both attempted to sue the administration for using their music without permission, while artists including Celine Dion, Beyoncé, Rihanna, Abba and Foo Fighters have released statements demanding Trump stop using their songs at campaign rallies and public appearances. Most recently, Olivia Rodrigo condemned the administration after the official Department of Homeland Security and White House Instagram account used her song All-American Bitch on a video promoting its controversial deportation efforts (the song was later removed by Instagram).\n\nSwift, however, has said nothing in public. The silence is surprising from an artist known to be litigious over unsanctioned use of her music or likeness: she has previously sued a theme park for playing her music without a licence, come for Etsy sellers for using lyrics from her songs in unofficial merch, taken on YouTube creators over copyright infringement and demanded retroactive songwriting credits from newer artists (including Rodrigo). (Her representatives did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nThat Swift and her team haven’t issued a statement distancing her from a president mired in scandal and an administration criticised for censorship, violent immigration raids and far-right policies, is curious. Once politically shy, she appeared to fully embrace and advocate for progressive values in 2018, so much so that her decision to speak out about politics became the narrative tent pole of her documentary Miss Americana. She has subsequently endorsed Democratic political candidates, supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 American presidential election, and criticised the supreme court’s decision to overturn Roe v Wade. “I need to be on the right side of history,” she said in Miss Americana, apparently defying the advice of team members including her own father.\n\nIt is now unclear whether that statement still stands. If it does, Swift seems less interested in telling us so: she hasn’t denounced ICE raids or commented on the Israel-Gaza conflict.\n\nIt’s a non-position that chimes with those of other once vocally liberal celebrities who have now clammed up about politics. Jennifer Lawrence recently said she would no longer publicly discuss the president as it would just “add fuel to a fire that’s ripping the country apart”. Instead, “a lot of the movies coming out from my production company are expressions of the political landscape”, she said, “and that’s how I feel like I can be helpful”. Other stars who endorsed Harris alongside Swift in 2024, including Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez and Katy Perry, have similarly remained schtum. Euphoria star Sydney Sweeney has refused to engage with the fraught political discourse, even after being revealed as a registered Republican.\n\nLike Lawrence, Swift may believe that publicly opposing the Trump administration would further fracture an already crumbling nation. She may be quietly supporting those whose lives have been affected by the government’s attacks on immigrants and minorities. And there is risk in speaking out: after Swift endorsed Harris, Trump said he “hates” Swift, and as the Jimmy Kimmel fracas demonstrated, the government isn’t afraid to use its heft to silence critics.\n\nFear of retribution hasn’t muffled other stars, though: both Rodrigo and Billie Eilish have made their feelings about the Trump administration clear, as have artists including Selena Gomez, Lady Gaga, Madonna and Bruce Springsteen.\n\nOf course, Swift has more to lose than most. Despite critical brickbats for The Life of a Showgirl, she has never been more popular, at least commercially. A forthcoming Disney-produced docuseries going behind the scenes of the Eras tour is hotly anticipated. And there are her upcoming nuptials to Travis Kelce. Their relationship has turned them into jingoistic emblems for red-blooded (and red-hatted) Americans: the late conservator commentator Charlie Kirk vociferously approved, while other Maga voices suggested their union would encourage Americans to procreate. It has helped reshape Swift’s image so much that even Trump softened on her: “I think that she’s a terrific person,” he said while congratulating the couple on their engagement.\n\nThe president may also see some of himself in Swift, a staunch businesswoman who releases multiple editions of her albums to generate extra revenue and secure high chart positions – seemingly timed to prevent other artists from reaching No 1. It’s telling that Swift’s attention right now appears to be on blocking Spanish star Rosalía from scoring a No 1 album with Lux, by releasing a new streaming-exclusive variant of The Life of a Showgirl. If that is the case, this money-grubbing, competition-destroying approach to pop stardom is paralleled in Trump’s profit-driven mindset, and her self-interest even perhaps has a parallel with his protectionist economic policy.\n\nSwift, as with corporations such as Disney, Meta, Paramount and Walmart, might see kissing the ring as economically advantageous. There is even a whiff of conservatism to the material on Showgirl that feels in step with Trump 2.0: Cancelled! defends those who have faced public backlash, while on Wi$h Li$t she fantasises about a white picket fence lifestyle, a basketball hoop and to “have a couple kids / Got the whole block looking like you.”\n\nIt is difficult to forget the young woman of Miss Americana who so passionately rejected the advice of those around her in order to speak up for what she believed was right. Whatever you think about celebrities’ impact on politics, Swift’s platform is so monumental that any public opposition to the Trump administration would be valuable, be it through her art or her actions. It may further fuel what is already a fiery and divisive political climate, but her influence gives her the potential to galvanise thousands in rejecting increasingly regressive and terrifying social and political norms.\n\nBut if Showgirl is indicative of Swift’s current preoccupations, she has never been more insular. Vengeful, self-absorbed and lacking imagination, it is the product of an artist who seems disconnected from the anxious state of the world. “I protect the family,” she sings on Father Figure. Once, you knew exactly what that meant. Now, it’s not so clear.","summary":"Official Trump social media accounts have been using The Life of a Showgirl snippets to promote his agenda.

They’ve even admitted that they cheated… They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\n\n“The people of the UK are very angry about what happened.”\n\nIn a separate interview with GB News broadcast on Saturday, Mr Trump said: “I’m not looking to get into lawsuits, but I think I have an obligation to do it.\n\n“This was so egregious. If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people.”\n\nOn Thursday, the BBC said the edit of Mr Trump’s speech on January 6, 2021, had given the “mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action”.\n\nThe broadcaster apologised and said the splicing of the speech was an “error of judgment” but refused to pay financial compensation after the president’s lawyers threatened to sue for one billion dollars in damages unless a retraction and apology were published.\n\nChairman Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House to apologise for the editing, and lawyers for the corporation wrote to the president’s legal team, a BBC spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n\nMr Trump told GB News he has had “a lot of success” litigating against news organisations.\n\n“Because it’s fake news,” he said. “But I’ve never had anything so fake as the BBC.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for a long time, I’ve never seen anything like (the BBC edit). That’s, that’s the most egregious.\n\n“I think that was worse than the Kamala (Harris) thing with CBS and 60 Minutes.”\n\nIn July, US media giant Paramount agreed to pay Mr Trump 16 million dollars to settle a lawsuit over a 2024 CBS interview with Ms Harris, the former vice-president and 2024 Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nMr Trump said his administration would be “finding out a lot of things over the next few months” through litigation.\n\nHe said the lawsuit would “probably” be filed “someplace in the US”, but said that litigation in the UK “moves a little bit quickly”.\n\nHe added that he would be speaking to Prime Minister Keir Starmer over the weekend.\n\nThe Panorama scandal prompted the resignations of two of the BBC’s most senior executives: director-general Tim Davie and news chief Deborah Turness.\n\nThe programme, broadcast a week before the 2024 US election results, spliced two clips together so that Mr Trump appeared to tell the crowd: “We’re going to walk down to the Capitol… and I’ll be there with you. And we fight. We fight like hell.”\n\nThe broadcaster said it will not air the Panorama episode Trump: A Second Chance? again, and published a retraction on the show’s webpage on Thursday.\n\nIt said: “This programme was reviewed after criticism of how President Donald Trump’s 6th January 2021 speech was edited.\n\n“During that sequence, we showed excerpts taken from different parts of the speech.\n\n“However, we accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\n\n“The BBC would like to apologise to President Trump for that error of judgment.”\n\nA spokesperson added: “The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary Trump: A Second Chance? on any BBC platforms.”\n\nOn Thursday, reports said that the BBC faced separate accusations of misleading viewers about Mr Trump’s 2021 Capitol speech more than two years before the Panorama edit aired.\n\nIn an episode broadcast in June 2022, Newsnight reportedly played an edited version of his speech, similar to the one used in the Panorama programme.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said about the fresh claims, reported by The Telegraph’s Daily T podcast: “The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards.

Two of the BBC’s top executives, Director General Tim Davie and its news chief, Deborah Turness, resigned over the incident and accusations of biased coverage. BBC chair Samir Shah sent a personal apology Thursday to the White House. \n\nTrump told reporters he had not raised the issue with Keir Starmer but that the British prime minister had asked to speak with him, according to media reports. “I’m going to call him over the weekend,” Trump said. “He’s very embarrassed,” he added. \n\n“I can say this, the U.K. is very, very embarrassed by the BBC,” Trump said.\n\nIn an interview late Friday with GB News, Trump said he had an “obligation” to sue the broadcaster. “This is beyond fake.

Can she win a run for Congress?","text":"Cosmetic dentist Dr. Heavenly Kimes has been throwing shade with a smile for over a decade on Bravo's \"Married to Medicine,\" the healthcare industry's answer to \"The Real Housewives of Atlanta.\"\n\nTV host and \"Housewives\" titan Andy Cohen once asked Kimes about castmate Toya Bush-Harris, \"So why did you say she's not the brightest in the group?\" Kimes had a blunt reply: \"Because she’s not.\"\n\nNow, Kimes, 54, is running in a crowded Democratic primary as she seeks to unseat Rep. David Scott, the 80-year-old incumbent in Georgia’s 13th congressional district, hoping that her reality TV bona fides will transfer to real results at the ballot box on May 19 next year.\n\nThe Essentials: Bravo's Captain Sandy shares the travel moment that changed her life\n\n\"People are sick of politics as usual,\" Kimes told USA TODAY. \"They need somebody real, somebody relatable that they can trust in office – somebody that's not going to leave them once they get in a seat.\" USA TODAY reached out to Scott's office for comment.\n\n\"I grew up in a room with no windows. Y'all saw that on TV, right?\" Kimes said, listing healthcare and the economy as reasons for running. \"I've been on both sides of the coin, I've actually had free lunches.\"\n\nThe race to replace Scott, who has long faced concerns about his health and age, has become its own made-for-TV moment, as some in both parties seek generational change. The incumbent has filed for reelection in the majority Black district, and ten other Democratic candidates have declared their candidacy for the safely blue seat, according to Federal Election Commission data.\n\nThe dental diva – best known as \"Dr. Heavenly\" – enters the race with likely more name recognition than any other candidate, boasting 1.5 million social media followers following over a decade on \"Medicine.\"\n\n'Married' to the reality TV game\n\nIn April 2014, Kimes joined the Season 2 cast of \"Medicine\" which pairs fellow doctors, like her close friend Dr. Jackie Walters, a board certified OBGYN, with doctors' wives — like frenemy Bush-Harris.\n\nKimes quickly proved she was no angel as a newbie, grinning through self-created battles with her fellow cast members. A sharp tongue and sweet tooth for chaos made Kimes a controversial \"Medicine\" fan favorite. \"I think Heavenly has this innate ability to start drama, to lean into drama, but then find her way out of a mess, to talk her way out of it,\" pop culture commentator and \"Gabbing with Gib\" podcast host Gibson Johns told USA TODAY.\n\n'We redefine Blackness': Mariah HuQ on 'Married to Medicine,' importance of telling Black stories\n\n\"Medicine\" is slightly more focused on family than the group dynamics of \"Housewives of Atlanta,\" once a standout in a franchise known for its heated table flips and unruly fights, although both center around the lives of affluent Black women in the metro.\n\nKimes opened an upscale dental practice on the series called Smiles by Dr. Heavenly in Duluth, Georgia, as she raised three kids Damon Jr., Zachary and Alaura with husband Dr. Damon Kimes. Regarded as an underrated part of Bravo's programming slate by hardcore fans, \"Medicine\" remains one of the network's longest running shows.\n\nSeason 12 of the series premieres Nov. 30, a rare feat for any show on cable television. In the next season of her life, Kimes wants to reach a rare feat for reality TV stars. On a podcast Sept. 4, Kimes told pastor Jamal Bryant – the ex-husband of \"Housewives of Potomac\" star Gizelle Bryant – that she didn't know there were \"Medicine\" contract restrictions preventing runs for public office.\n\nKimes originally announced her intent to seek a Georgia state rep seat in a People magazine feature July 7. She later ditched the state-level race in September to launch a bid for U.S. House after the passage of President Donald Trump's controversial mega tax and spending bill. \"I noticed that our congressman wasn't saying anything and a lot of people needed help,\" Kimes said.\n\n\"I'm not politics as usual, but I understand what's going on,\" Kimes said in an interview. \"This is the greatest country we got. I mean, if other countries can have free medical, if they can have free colleges, if they can have free childcare, why can't we?\"\n\nRep. David Scott has faced concerns over attendance, voting\n\nLast year, congressional colleagues booted Scott from the top Democratic post on the House Agriculture Committee. He lost his powerful perch on the panel despite breaking barriers as its first Black chairman.\n\nScott has served in Congress since 2003. Kimes' fellow primary opponent Georgia State Rep. Jasmine Clark chided Scott in recent weeks after a CBS News Atlanta report revealed that her campaign unearthed that the congressman has failed to vote since casting an absentee ballot in May last year.\n\n\"He lost that ranking membership because he wasn't able to show up,\" Clark, 42, told CBS Atlanta. \"Him not voting unfortunately feels like a part of that trend.\" According to CBS and Fox 5 Atlanta, the missed votes include last year's presidential contest between Trump and then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMeet the young Black MAGA fans trying to grow Trump's movement\n\nAnother primary challenger Everton Blair – the ex-chair of Gwinnett County Schools – told USA TODAY that the breadth of the field shows how unhappy people are with Scott. “It’s telling that so many candidates are following suit and entering this race after we launched,\" Blair, 33, said in a statement. \"People are clearly fed up with Rep. David Scott’s lack of leadership and are ready for change.\"\n\nHe also took aim at Kimes. \"People are fed up with the mockery that’s been made of our government,\" Blair added. \"While I respect anyone’s interest in public service, voters deserve leaders with policy experience and proven credibility.\"\n\nKimes pushed back on criticism of her lack of political experience. \"I built businesses from the ground up, I know what it's like to get the red tape in small businesses,\" she said.\n\n\"I think that what the people need most, whether it be reality TV or such, is somebody with a reach and a voice and I just happen to have both, right?\" Kimes continued.\n\nReality TV stars have struggled in political campaigns in recent years\n\nTypically, stars like Kimes face an uphill climb during political campaigns.\n\n\"American Idol\" runner-up Clay Aiken and Olympic decathlete turned \"Kardashians\" star Caitlyn Jenner both tried to seize electorally on their fame but failed. Of course, the most glaring exception to that is pre-White House Trump's star turn on NBC's \"The Apprentice\" and a companion celebrity edition.\n\nIn recent years, C-SPAN cameras that capture the humming and hearings of Congress could deliver footage worthy of Bravo. After Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R – Georgia) criticized Rep. Jasmine Crockett (D – Texas) last May for her false eyelashes, Crockett went viral for calling the MAGA acolyte a \"beach blonde bad built butch body.\" Kimes says she \"can go toe-to-toe\" with Greene, but will try to work alongside Republicans on policy matters.\n\nRep. Jasmine Crockett's viral 'Bleach blonde bad built butch body': coming to t-shirts soon?\n\nSociologist Danielle Lindemann, author of \"True Story: What Reality TV Says About Us,\" believes politics and reality TV are more alike than most people think: Both involve people performing for an audience while presenting themselves as \"real.\"\n\n\"In politics, we may be more likely to vote for candidates we 'like,' based on their performances,\" Lindemann said. \"For instance, there's that trope of wanting a politician that we feel like we could get a beer with.\"\n\nCould this be Dr. Heavenly's last BravoCon?\n\nBack home in Georgia, Kimes is staying in the race like she's stayed on \"Medicine\" all these years. \"This was a very difficult season for me,\" she says. Kimes revealed that her eldest son Damon Jr.'s arrest will play out on the show.\n\nKimes was demoted from main cast member and has less airtime this season – a move some believe Bravo made due to her congressional hopes – but she was allowed to film while running for office. Johns called it \"unprecedented\" for a Bravo star to run for office while on a show. \"Her forgoing a full-time role on the show to be able to run for Congress should tell you everything you need to know about how serious she is about this,\" Johns said.\n\n'Real Housewives of Potomac' star Wendy Osefo and husband Eddie arrested on fraud charges\n\nKimes counts co-star \"Dr. Jackie\" Walters as a major supporter. \"She brings energy, fresh thinking, and a real commitment to the families and communities she serves,\" Walters said in a Nov. 13 statement to USA TODAY, adding that she wants \"to acknowledge Congressman David Scott for his many years of service.\"\n\nBravolebrities like Kimes, Walters and the \"Medicine\" ensemble will head to BravoCon from Nov. 14 to 16 in Las Vegas to greet guests, pose in pictures and throw shade on panels. The three-day extravaganza is the Super Bowl for people who enjoy watching \"Vanderpump Rules.\"\n\nThis could be Kimes' last Bravo bonanza. \"I don't know what the future holds,\" she said. \"All I know right now is that our country needs me.\"\n\nWho knows if Kimes will make the plane ride to Vegas next November. Georgia's 13th District might make Kimes their next congresswoman.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/11/15/bravocon-dr-heavenly-kimes-married-to-medicine-congress/87229001007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/13/USAT/87254436007-heavenly-1.jpeg?auto=webp&crop=1919,1079,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 08:00:58","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.116},{"id":379202418,"title":"MAGA's darkest hour: MTG's Epstein revolt rips open Trump's rawest wound as Israel, economy and migrant crises close in","text":"Donald Trump and Marjorie Taylor Greene's cataclysmic break-up has ignited a powder keg inside MAGA. \n\nAt its heart, the president's major campaign promise to release the Epstein files.\n\nTrump's failure to deliver on that pledge has become a rallying cry for Greene and other Republican rebels on Capitol Hill, a fallout that came to a head on Friday as the pair traded vicious barbs on social media.\n\nThe president - who has long said he cut Epstein off decades ago and did nothing wrong - explosively announced he was 'unendorsing' the Georgia Republican, accusing her of becoming 'left wing'.\n\nBut for Greene, the issue is bigger than Trump - it's about 'America First', a central MAGA tenet.\n\nThe mantra carried the president back to the White House in November, the first Republican to win the popular vote in 20 years as he swept every swing state over Kamala Harris. \n\nHowever, as Trump has pushed through the MAGA agenda, several key allies have publicly clashed with the administration on several key issues and, in some cases, been cast out.\n\nThose disagreements have taken place on policies ranging from Trump's handling of migrant visas to Israel, but perhaps none have ripped MAGA apart more than the Epstein files. \n\nJust months into the second Trump presidency, Department of Government Efficiency Chairman and former 'First Buddy' Elon Musk had a turbocharged version of the argument Greene and Trump had Friday night. \n\nIt was Musk who initially suggested Trump was in the Epstein files just after he'd left the White House, writing on June 5: '@RealDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,' Musk wrote. 'Have a nice day, DJT!' \n\nDespite deleting his infamous tweet, Musk continued to bash Trump for the lack of transparency on the files as the year went on. \n\nAnti-trans activist Riley Gaines also slammed the president for saying people who wanted more answers on Epstein were either 'stupid' or 'foolish.'\n\nAs the year has gone on, Trump gathered further enemies among Republican members of Congress. \n\nKentucky Rep. Thomas Massie led the charge on releasing the files and secured votes from close Trump allies Greene, Lauren Boebert and Nancy Mace along with all Congressional Democrats. \n\nTrump has made Massie into a punching bag, including a post to Truth Social just prior to his rant about Greene mocking Massie's marriage earlier this month, which came a year after the passing of his wife. \n\nOther issues have divided the right as well, including a split with many online figures about the president's support of Israel. \n\nCandace Owens, one of the far right's biggest media personalities, has continuously hit Trump on his handling of the Middle East. \n\nEarlier this week, she made the wild claim that the state of Israel was blackmailing Trump over the files, repeating the conspiracy theory that Epstein was a Mossad agent. \n\nTucker Carlson also slammed the government's support of Israel, calling them 'not allies in any way.' \n\nThe former Fox News host even claimed that he and the late Charlie Kirk had lobbied President Trump not to get involved in the conflict. \n\nCarlson has split much of the right over his interview with controversial far-right figure Nick Fuentes, a battle Trump has stayed out of. \n\nGreene has also joined this particular issue, linking up with far left figures like Bernie Sanders in calling the war against Hamas in Gaza a 'genocide' and feuding with several prominent Republicans on the issue. \n\nTrump has also lost segments of the right over his support of visas for foreign students and workers.\n\nIn an interview Tuesday, Trump angered some of his MAGA base after claiming the United States needs foreign workers because it doesn’t have enough talented people in its own workforce. \n\nThe president made the controversial remark during a sit-down with Fox News' Laura Ingraham on Tuesday night where the pair sparred over his administration’s policy on H-1B visas, which allows the US to hire highly-skilled foreign workers. \n\nTrump signed an executive order in September that slapped a $100,000 one-time fee on the work visa but he appeared unwilling to consider any further limits during a tense interview with Ingraham. \n\nThe conservative host and known Trump ally pressed him on the issue, asking: 'Does this mean the H-1B visa thing will not be a big priority for your administration? Because if you want to raise wages for American workers, you can't flood the country with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of foreign workers.' \n\nTrump snapped back: 'I agree but you also do have to bring in talent.' \n\n'Well, we have plenty of talented people here,' insisted Ingraham. \n\n'No you don't, no you don't,' Trump said.\n\nIngraham again asked: 'We don't have plenty of talented people here?'\n\nNo, you don't have certain talents and people have to learn,' Trump explained. \n\n'You can’t take people off the unemployment line and say, ''I'm gonna' put you in a factory, go make missiles.'' \n\nTrump admitted that he and Ingraham disagree on the issue but said he couldn't expect foreign countries to invest billions in America to take people 'off the unemployment line' to do jobs they weren't trained for.\n\nMany conservatives were irate with Trump and took Ingraham's side in the discussion. \n\n'This is insane - we are going to lose the mid-terms so badly,' wrote Anthony Sabatini.\n\n'We've never seen an administration crash and burn in its first year so badly - for no reason other than to appease donors and special interests. Trump has surrounded himself with the worst people.'\n\nAnother wrote: 'Well, so much for America first. I'm never voting Republican again, screw them. I'm done. There are plenty of talented Americans.'\n\n'Absolute disgrace of a president, at this point there is literally no difference between Trump and Biden,' said another. \n\nSome pointed out that Trump ally Vivek Ramaswamy had gone to war with MAGA over this very issue earlier this year, with Ramaswamy largely exiled from the White House's Department of Government Efficiency following the debate. \n\nRamaswamy, who was initially named co-chief of DOGE, ignited the controversy - perhaps an early sign of Trumpism losing its base - with a provocative post on X. \n\nIn his message, he voiced strong support for bringing 'highly skilled' foreign workers to the U.S., even as MAGA voters and Trump himself have championed stricter immigration policies.\n\n'The reason top tech companies often hire foreign-born & first-generation engineers over 'native' Americans isn't because of an innate American IQ deficit (a lazy & wrong explanation),' Ramaswamy wrote. \n\n'A key part of it comes down to the c-word: culture. Tough questions demand tough answers & if we're really serious about fixing the problem, we have to confront the TRUTH: Our American culture has venerated mediocrity over excellence for way too long.'\n\nThe post sparked a massive backlash on the right objecting to Ramaswamy's views of American culture. \n\nAlthough Musk supported Ramaswamy on the visas, the former presidential candidate soon found himself on the outside of Trump's inner circle, vacating a job co-running DOGE with Musk to run for governor of Ohio. \n\nRamaswamy has remained loyal to Trump, however, and the president has returned that loyalty by endorsing his campaign. \n\nThe latest inner party struggle began earlier this week, as Trump tried to stop Greene, Colorado's Lauren Boebert and South Carolina's Nancy Mace from supporting Massie's petition to hold a vote on releasing the Epstein files. \n\nTrump met with Boebert in person and played phone tag with Mace on the issue, with the president later claiming it was getting in the way of promoting his agenda.\n\nOfficials in the president's administration reportedly have fumed at the Republican lawmaker defections.\n\n'Helping Democrats deflect from Republican success is not a good GOP primary election strategy,' one White House official told NOTUS earlier this week.\n\nOn Air Force One Friday, Trump lashed out at 'dumb Republicans' who went along with the Democrats.\n\n'Because we think it's bad to talk about it because it gets away from the subject of how well the Republicans are doing,' he said. \n\n'We have the greatest economy, we have the largest investment ever made in our country's history, we have all of these great things happening, we have very little inflation,' Trump added, comparing his successes to the failures of predecessor Joe Biden. \n\n'And when you talk about the Epstein hoax, what happens is you're not talking about how well we've done. That's the whole purpose behind that, they want to waste people's time and some of the dumber Republicans like that. But it's mostly Democrats.' \n\nGreene, who has recently been outspoken in her positions that contrast with the Trump administration's, has voiced her support for the release was inspired by Epstein's survivors. \n\nOther GOP members have already noted they will vote for the measure when it comes to the floor for a full vote next week. \n\nSince the petition received signatures from half of the entire House, Speaker Mike Johnson is limited in his ability to quash the vote.\n\nHours after his comments on Air Force One, Trump laid out the pair's dirty laundry - including an admission that he advised her not to run for Senate in 2026 - on Truth Social earlier Friday evening.\n\n'I am withdrawing my support and Endorsement of “Congresswoman” Marjorie Taylor Greene, of the Great State of Georgia,' he wrote. \n\nTrump then listed the accomplishments of his nine months in office before alleging that 'all I see “Wacky” Marjorie do is COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN, COMPLAIN!' \n\nHe wrote: 'It seemed to all begin when I sent her a Poll stating that she should not run for Senator, or Governor, she was at 12%, and didn’t have a chance (unless, of course, she had my Endorsement — which she wasn’t about to get!).'\n\nThe president claims that since he refused to endorse her ambitions, he doesn't return her phone calls. \n\n'With 219 Congressmen/women, 53 U.S. Senators, 24 Cabinet Members, almost 200 Countries, and an otherwise normal life to lead, I can’t take a ranting Lunatic’s call every day,' Trump claimed.\n\nHe then suggested that Greene should face a primary to retain her deep red seat in Georgia in 2026. \n\n'I understand that wonderful, Conservative people are thinking about primarying Marjorie in her District of Georgia, that they too are fed up with her and her antics and, if the right person runs, they will have my Complete and Unyielding Support,' he said.\n\nTrump then claimed the Greene 'has gone Far Left, even doing The View, with their Low IQ Republican hating Anchors. Thank you for your attention to this matter.' \n\nThe president also hit out at Massie in a Truth Social post right before his slap at Greene.\n\nGreene fired back by sharing screenshots of texts she sent to Trump about the importance of the Epstein files, as well as with another person named 'NH' - an apparent reference to the president's assistant Natalie Harp. \n\nThe text message she sent Trump advises him to 'lean in' to former President Bill Clinton's own connections to the billionaire pedophile. Earlier Friday, Trump ordered an investigation into Clinton's ties to Epstein. \n\n'Check the flight logs of Epstein's plane. Bill Clinton is on there like 26 times! Hillary too!! For many of us, releasing the Epstein files has always been for the women who were victims of Jeffrey Epstein, but also because we believed Democrat bad guys like the Clintons were entangled and involved with him,' Greene said in the text.\n\n'Epstein was the spider that wove the web of the deep state. Lean into it,' she advised.\n\nIn the second screenshot, Greene responds to a text from 'NH' that appears to be fuming about her Trump criticisms, stating: 'THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN HOAX.'\n\nGreene replies: 'In every single interview I have done I have defended President Trump. I've said over and over the women say he did nothing wrong and their attorney says he's the only one who helped. And the Democrats had 4 years to release the files but did nothing.' \n\nGreene adds: 'Stop ignoring the women. Many of them literally voted for President Trump and say so publicly. Them being raped as teenagers is not a hoax. \n\nIn a lengthy statement on X, Greene explained: '[Trump is] coming after me hard to make an example to scare all the other Republicans before next weeks vote to release the Epstein files. It’s astonishing really how hard he’s fighting to stop the Epstein files from coming out that he actually goes to this level.'\n\n'But really most Americans wish he would fight this hard to help the forgotten men and women of America who are fed up with foreign wars and foreign causes, are going broke trying to feed their families, and are losing hope of ever achieving the American dream. That’s what I voted for,' she continued. \n\nGreene noted that she has given Trump 'too much of my precious time, too much of my own money, and fought harder for him even when almost all other Republicans turned their back and denounced him.' \n\n'But I don’t worship or serve Donald Trump. I worship God, Jesus is my savior, and I serve my district GA14 and the American people. I remain the same today as I’ve always been and I will continue to pray this administration will be successful because the American people desperately deserve what they voted for. For me, I remain America First and America Only!!!' \n\nIn a post shortly after, Greene even touched on the immigration scrap Trump had earlier this week, quote-tweeting her supporting for limiting H1B visas. \n\nThe Daily Mail has reached out to the White House for further comment.\n\nNow, the Republican Party appears tangled in inner party scraps just weeks after Democrats won governorships in Virginia and New Jersey, admittedly blue states, by double digit margins and saw an admitted socialist elected mayor of New York City.\n\nJason Calacanis, a co-host of the popular All In podcast, summed it up in a response to Greene's tweet about the president. \n\n'What a self-inflicted wound by the GOP… Just release the files, deal with a bit of embarrassment and get back to the Trump 2.0 agenda - which the 47th administration has completely ignored for months,' he wrote. \n\n'This is the challenge with 47 - focusing on what matters to the people who voted him in.","summary":"From Elon Musk to Tucker Carlson, from Marjorie Taylor Greene to Thomas Massie, Trump has spent much of his second term turning former allies into enemies.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15293425/MAGA-battle-Marjorie-Taylor-Greene-Donald-Trump-Epstein.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/11/15/06/103904117-0-image-m-21_1763187955700.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/11/12/7703693622809836607/1024x576_MP4_7703693622809836607.mp4","publish_date":"2025-11-15 07:09:55","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

If you’d like to get this direct to your inbox, every single week, you can sign up here.\n\nThe UK-US special relationship has turned abusive since Donald Trump returned to the White House. What had once been an amicable partnership has become toxic, with the bullying and humiliation of the weaker partner – the UK – the new norm.\n\nA striking feature of Trump’s attack on the BBC is the timid response from the UK Government, which has failed to defend robustly the single remaining British institution commanding huge global influence. A further sign of pusillanimity is the Government’s failure to pillory Reform UK and Conservative Party leaders, who are usually so quick to leap on to their patriotic high horse, for aiding and abetting Trump’s interference in British politics.\n\nNot that this kowtowing to Trump is likely to do Sir Keir Starmer and his Government much good. Leaders like Trump are notorious for despising weakness and react to it by stepping up their brutal attacks. Appeasement is not to be despised when dealing with an unstable and mercurial despot wielding great power, but Trump’s record shows that he only takes seriously as political players those who resist him.\n\nReceiving Trump at Windsor Castle like a mediaeval monarch, with marching bands and troops in colourful 19th century uniforms, might appear harmless enough. But repeated displays of servility do more damage to the UK than it might appear – and for reasons that have little to do with the realpolitik of international relations.\n\nThe zeitgeist or national mood in the UK has changed for the worse since the Brexit referendum in 2016. A consequence of the years of political turmoil in Britain since then is a spectacular loss of national self-confidence. In the summer of 2019 Sir John Sawers, the former head of MI6, said that the UK was “going through a political nervous breakdown”. This breakdown got even worse in the following years with a series of comic governments straight out of Gilbert and Sullivan.\n\nBelief in a broken Britain – a cliché favoured by those who have never seen a really broken country – is exaggerated. But there is nothing like a sense of national failure to create real failure by opening the door wide to political snake-oil salesmen selling fake solutions to non-existent crises.\n\nA debacle such as the BBC apologising for making a trivial error to Trump, a man with a galactic reputation for mendacity, is one more pinprick puncturing a deflated national morale. Predictably, the Government has kept out of the dispute for fear of offending Trump. This will make it increasingly difficult for Starmer to present himself and his Government, as he did in his speech at the Labour Party conference, as the greatest obstacle to Nigel Farage and Reform UK. He cannot credibly do this and at the same time stay mute about Trump and the Maga Republicans egging on their far-right allies in the UK with fake facts and smears.\n\nA more agile and less conservative politician than Starmer might have used the row over the BBC to put a little distance between himself and Trump. Instead, he and his Cabinet were publicly stabbing each other in the back just as the BBC leadership was being decapitated in one of those melodramatic Downing Street intrigues that political correspondents report with such relish.\n\nThe first Trump presidency could be dismissed as a blip in American history. He kept appointing and sacking Washington establishment figures who sought to sabotage from within his assault on the status quo. It is his second term that is proving revolutionary. Close alliance with America remains the crown jewel of British foreign policy, as it has since the Second World War. There have always been grumbles about Britain becoming the 51st US state, but supporters of the alliance asked, unanswerably: what better alternative was there to being the premier ally of the most powerful state in the world? \n\nTo keep this alliance in repair, and prove British relevance as international players, the UK fought ill-advised wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Whatever went right or wrong on the battlefield, so they argued, British support for the US in Iraq paid off in terms of British influence in Washington. This sounded convincing, except that the Chilcot report in 2016 on the Iraq War concluded that British advice was routinely ignored by the Americans.\n\nThe special relationship may never have delivered as much as the British hoped, but today its costs have soared exponentially while its benefits have plummeted. Trump’s weird autocracy-in-the-making in Washington does not feel that it needs allies. There has always been a messianic unilateralist strain in the American attitude to the outside world, seeing the US as the shining city on a hill superior to all others. It is this view that is now high in the ascendant. As the uber-Trumpian house member Marjorie Taylor Greene said this week that she was not just America First, but “America First and only”.\n\nAppeasement as a way of coping with dictators, or proto-dictators like Trump, has got itself a bad name because of the failure of appeasing Hitler with the Munich Agreement in 1938. Trump is not Hitler, but efforts to conciliate him by concessions are likely to prove equally ineffective. Starmer’s efforts to slither into his good graces have so far proved embarrassingly inept, such as sending Peter Mandelson as UK ambassador to Washington – though it beggars belief that anybody in Downing Street should have imagined that a close associate of Jeffrey Epstein, from whom Trump is desperately trying to distance himself, should be welcome in the White House.\n\nWill the Government continue to tolerate an ideological offensive by Trump in order to maintain cordial relations with the US? It is not clear that punching back would capsize what is left of the special relationship, since Trump regards his headline grabbing tweets and off-the-cuff remarks as primarily being directed at dominating the daily news agenda.\n\nIt may become less easy in future for Starmer to stay on the fence. Silence on Trump’s misdeeds will be interpreted as complicity. The reputational damage of fawning to such a corrupt and arbitrary regime are high. Two big political success stories of the last couple of months have been Zohran Mamdani winning the race to be mayor of New York City on an uncompromising anti-Trump ticket, while the equally anti-Trump Green Party of England and Wales, under its new leader Zack Polanski, equalling or surpassing Labour in the polls.\n\nThe BBC has apologised, but it is refusing to pay Trump compensation. It can take comfort in the fact that US media companies and universities resisting Trump have fared better than those which ran up the white flag.\n\nAs Rudyard Kipling says in his poem about the Anglo-Saxons being blackmailed into paying Danegeld in return for a quiet life: “We’ve proved it again and again / That if once you have paid him the Dane-geld / You never get rid of the Dane.” Much the same applies to the Trump.\n\nFurther Thoughts\n\nWhen democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani won the election to become mayor of New York City, various commentators naively assumed that this might be good news for Trump and the Republicans, because they could demonise Mamdani and the Democratic Party as communists and antisemites.\n\nBut their rejoicing is likely to be ill-judged. They should remember that in 2016 it was the Democrats who believed that Trump would be easy to demonise as a crackpot and extremist. But they found that targeting him only promoted him to the top of the news agenda day after day. Attacking him relentlessly made him news, and they did not manage to launch many punishing blows because he knew how to counter-punch, never apologised, and skilfully used the platform provided for free by his enemies to reach a vast audience.\n\nHis task was made easier because of the inadequacy of the Democratic presidential candidates – Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris – as communicators. This created a vacuum of news that Trump was happy to fill.\n\nMamdani knows how to play this game, agilely fending off criticism and using the opportunity provided by the most hostile news outlets to promote his social and economic policies on housing, transport, childcare and the cost of living. This skill is easy to explain, but not easy to do. Accusations from aggressive, over-confident interviewers bounce off him. In the UK, the Greens’ Zack Polanski has much the same abilities and in a few months has propelled the party above Labour in the polls.\n\nBeneath the Radar\n\nYears ago, I read the Russian fiction writer Isaac Babel’s Odessa Stories, about gangsters in the Ukrainian port city of Odesa on the Black Sea before and after the October Revolution in 1917. I was astonished this week to read a report by the Geneva-based Global Initiative Against Transnational Organised Crime (GIATOC), which collates information from police forces all over the world, saying that gangsters are once again flourishing in Odesa. It describes the city as “an oasis for organised crime”.\n\nDespite being under constant air attack, Odesa has the right balance of stability, instability and money from the Ukraine grain trade for organised crime to take root in a “free city”, which means it is not dominated by any single criminal gang. Criminal enterprises include scam call centres, synthetic drug manufacturers and tax evasion and other frauds in the grain export business. The Ukrainian state has lost about $3bn (£2.2bn) in tax receipts alone, according to the report. \n\nWartime conditions allow the city’s volunteer units – in theory acting as civil defence forces – to facilitate the night-time vice economy, moving drugs and sex workers to clients during curfew. Sex trafficking and prostitution are rife, but bigger profits are expected from criminal capture of foreign aid designed for reconstruction.\n\nAll these enterprises are highly profitable. The report says that one man who ran 10 scam call centres was “given, as a birthday present, the day’s takings from all the call centres under his control – half a million dollars”.\n\nCurfew between midnight and 5am provides challenges and opportunities for enterprising criminals. Georgian gangs that previously specialised in burglary, car theft and street crime are largely out of business. Azeri gangs steal cars and then ransom them back to their owners. Another money-making business is smuggling out of the country men of military age who are paying large sums to avoid conscription into the Ukrainian army. One conscript smuggler used an ambulance to transport prospective conscripts to the border during curfew “under the guise of transporting patients to hospital”. According to one investigative journalist, “high-level drug dealers use volunteer patrols to transport drugs and sex workers around the city at night”. Babel, who was executed in the purges in 1940, would have found all this highly familiar.\n\nCockburn’s Picks\n\nFawning obituaries of political leaders with appalling records are always hard to stomach, none more so than those that greeted the death of the former US vice president Dick Cheney. Andrew Cockburn (full disclosure: my brother) has written a trenchant, highly informed account of his career in his Substack.\n\nFor a quick sampling of the evil Richard B Cheney injected into the American political system, it is only necessary to review the fawning obsequies posted within hours of his death by Bill Clinton and Kamala Harris. \n\nNeither of them had the slightest problem with eulogising a man who dragged the country into a disastrous and illegal war that killed thousands of young Americans and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, shredded civil liberties, fostered torture, and did as much as anyone to pave the way for Donald Trump’s assumption of authoritarian executive powers.","url":"https://inews.co.uk/opinion/starmer-pay-price-spinelessness-toward-trump-4036767","image":"https://inews.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SEI_274350830.jpg?crop=0px%2C73px%2C1200px%2C677px&resize=1200%2C675","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 07:00:00","author":"Patrick Cockburn","authors":["Patrick Cockburn"],"language":"en","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.068},{"id":379192526,"title":"Trump vows to sue BBC for up to $5bn over edited Panorama clip","text":"Donald Trump says he will sue the BBC next week after the corporation apologised but declined to compensate him for its edited version of a 2021 speech broadcast by Panorama.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on board Air Force One on Friday, Mr Trump said: “We’ll sue them for anywhere between 1 billion dollars (£759.8 million) and 5 billion dollars (£3.79 billion), probably sometime next week.”\n\nThe BBC apologised but said it refused to pay financial compensation.\n\nThe corporation said the splicing of the speech was an “error of judgment”.\n\nStill, it rejected his compensation demands, after Mr Trump’s lawyers threatened to sue the BBC for one billion dollars in damages unless a retraction and apology were published.\n\nMr Trump’s lawyers had given the BBC a 10pm Friday deadline to respond.\n\nEarlier in the week, Mr Trump said in an interview with Fox News that the BBC had “defrauded the public” over the edit, which made it appear as if he was explicitly urging people to attack the US Capitol on January 6 2021.\n\nSeparately, Mr Trump told GB News in an interview broadcast on Saturday he felt an “obligation” to take legal action against the public broadcaster.\n\n“I’m not looking to get into lawsuits, but I think I have an obligation to do it,” he said.\n\n“This was so egregious. If you don’t do it, you don’t stop it from happening again with other people.”\n\nChairman Samir Shah has sent a personal letter to the White House to apologise for the editing, and lawyers for the corporation have written to the president’s legal team, a BBC spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson added: “While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree there is a basis for a defamation claim.”\n\nMr Trump told GB News he has had “a lot of success” litigating against news organisations.\n\n“Because it’s fake news,” he said. “But I’ve never had anything so fake as the BBC.\n\n“I’ve been doing this for a long time, I’ve never seen anything like (the BBC edit).

We fight like hell.”\n\nOn board Air Force One, Mr Trump told the Daily Telegraph Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was “very embarrassed” by the incident and said he would speak with him over the weekend.\n\nHe said: “I think I have to do it. They’ve even admitted that they cheated… They changed the words coming out of my mouth.\n\n“The people of the UK are very angry about what happened.”\n\nThe broadcaster said it will not air the Panorama episode Trump: A Second Chance? again, and published a retraction on the show’s webpage on Thursday.\n\nIt said: “This programme was reviewed after criticism of how President Donald Trump’s 6th January 2021 speech was edited.\n\n“During that sequence, we showed excerpts taken from different parts of the speech.\n\n“However, we accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action.\n\n“The BBC would like to apologise to President Trump for that error of judgment.”\n\nA spokesperson added: “The BBC has no plans to rebroadcast the documentary Trump: A Second Chance? on any BBC platforms.”\n\nOn Thursday, reports said that the BBC faced separate accusations of misleading viewers about Mr Trump’s 2021 Capitol speech more than two years before the Panorama edit aired.\n\nIn an episode broadcast in June 2022, Newsnight reportedly played an edited version of his speech, similar to the one used in the Panorama programme.\n\nA BBC spokesperson said about the fresh claims, reported by The Telegraph’s Daily T podcast: “The BBC holds itself to the highest editorial standards.

I don’t like his politics, his religion, his flagrantly daft promises. And I absolutely hate the fact that – while not my type – he is, objectively, extremely good-looking.\n\nIs it just me, or is it always irritating when people whose politics you hate are easy on the eye? Justin ruddy Trudeau – again, not my type, but so cardigan-catalogue male-modelly that he could even get away being caught in blackface again by going on TV and simply looking sad. That Canada’s ex-PM has ended up with Katy Perry – a similarly hollow sex-object who has somehow managed to mistake themselves for some sort of deep thinker – is perfection.\n\nThen there’s Kamala bloody Harris. I can’t stand the babbling fool, but she looks like one of those single-minded, dual-heritage glamorous business babes from a daytime American soap opera. The sodding ‘Squad’ – Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley – of young sparky Democrats could be a girl band, albeit one that has hung around a bit too long and are on the verge of splitting up, probably due to a pre-performance squabble over who gets to wear the best keffiyah.\n\nThe British equivalent would be the Three Disgraces on the Labour benches; Lisa Nandy, Stella Creasy and Angela Rayner (a brunette, blonde and redhead to satisfy every preference) who showed an attractive girl group energy until they drank the Trans-maid Kool-Aid. But though these may be reasonably foxy foes, it’s unfortunate that the real looker of British politics is Michelle O’Neill, First Minister of Northern Ireland and vice president of Sinn Fein – a raving beauty in more ways than one. Then there’s the far less offensive Penny Mordaunt; ineffably daft views on ‘gender’ but my goodness, that image of her carrying that sword could have been used on the cover of a best-selling romantasy fiction novel.\n\nThough we’d all probably agree that Mordaunt is more-ish, beauty can be in the eye of the beholder, as is oft remarked. Mrs Thatcher was a handsome and well-groomed woman, but when François Mitterrand opined that she had ‘the mouth of Marilyn Monroe’ he was obviously nursing a massive, vision-bending crush on his apparent enemy. John F Kennedy was meant to be a total hottie, but the pop eyes and the Bugs Bunny voice make this an absolute mystery to me; perhaps it was simply that he had the bloom of youth whereas others American presidents had looked either frail or stodgy, and was beautiful by proxy due to the loveliness of his wife Jacqueline.\n\nAren’t there any politicians I like who look good? Peter Kyle (who also smells gorgeous), Kemi Badenoch (especially when photographed off duty without make-up) and the now-retired Kate Forbes (face of a schoolgirl, heart of a lion.) But none in the league of Barack Obama, who Fleabag once memorably abused herself to online while he made one of his highly serious speeches, as her boyfriend slept beside her.\n\nOn a less lurid note, I recall the years when Tony Blair and Gordon Brown were both a team and deadly rivals. Blair was the conventionally attractive man (such a pretty boy in his youth that, according to the Times, his nickname at school was ‘Miranda, because of his fresh face and long hair’) but Brown had a Heathcliff element going on which made his boss look somewhat bland. The brilliant teenage writer Emma Forrest, I recall, wrote a long eulogy to him in a newspaper, in which various immature women – including myself and my late sister-in-law Charlotte Raven – openly drooled over the chancellor. I wish I could quote myself from it directly and give you all a cheap laugh but it appears to have been wiped from t’internet.\n\nSo yes, most attractive politicians are ones I dislike. But there’s one thing that we on the ‘Right’ (aka freedom-lovers) do have in the political arena that the Left don’t; gorgeous political commentators and broadcasters. We’ve got Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Inaya Folarin Iman, Coleman Hughes, Rita Pahani, Megyn Kelly, Winston Marshall, Louise Perry, Poppy Coburn, Samara Gill, Suzie Kennedy – not to mention several Spectator staffers whose blushes I’ll spare. (Hi, Madeline!) And of course the king of the heap, Douglas Murray, in whom extreme physical beauty and a diamond-tipped pick-axe of a mind create a matchless combo.\n\nBut for the most part, politics is showbiz for ugly people; the beautiful have no part in it. They already have more than enough power and admiration. \n\nI do hope that Zohran Mamdani is already making plans to get an agent and move out to the West Coast, leaving the serious stuff of life to others. Because looking at the track record of those who come to power believing that they have espied the legendary Magic Money Tree, he’ll be needing a new career quite soon, I’d wager.","url":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/why-are-the-worst-politicians-always-so-beautiful/","image":"https://www.spectator.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2221991703-1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 05:30:00","author":"Julie Burchill","authors":["Julie Burchill"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.047},{"id":379164118,"title":"'They cheated': Trump plans $1bn–$5bn lawsuit against BBC; what the speech edit row is about?","text":"After the BBC came under scrutiny for editing Donald Trump’s 6 January 2021 speech, the US President announced that he plans to take legal action against the broadcaster.The BBC apologised for the edit, saying it had \"unintentionally given the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" but the corporation said it would not offer financial compensation.

I don’t claim to be.\n\nI’ve worked races. When Bob Livingston ran for governor of Louisiana in 1987, I was 17 years old and volunteered for him. Before it was over, the campaign had me supervising a crew putting up yard signs all over the New Orleans area. That’s how far back I go.\n\nI’ve written speeches, I’ve advised candidates in lots of levels of races. I run a PAC. I have political experience going back a while.\n\nBut I’m a writer and a pundit by trade, not a political pro. So I don’t claim to know everything. All I can offer is impressions formed from years — if I say decades, that’d make me an old man, and I refuse to make such an admission — of watching the process play out, mostly from the outside but sometimes from the inside.\n\nAnd what I can say with as much certainty as anything I’ll ever put in these pages is that you can’t win elections with only the people who agree with you on everything.\n\nIt doesn’t work. It never works. When America was a virtually homogenous country in which white-guy property owners were the only ones voting, getting even those people to create a consensus on the major issues of the day was more or less impossible. And it’s certainly not going to work in the America we inhabit now.\n\nWinning elections requires building coalitions.\n\nAnd the Republican establishment, which seems to be hell-bent on recapturing the party now that JD Vance seems to be setting himself up as the leader in waiting in advance of the 2028 presidential cycle, utterly stinks at both.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, John Daniel Davidson knocked out a spot-on column at The Federalist identifying the attacks on The Heritage Foundation’s Kevin Roberts over the latter’s defense of Tucker Carlson — this was in the aftermath of Carlson’s more-or-less cordial interview of Nick Fuentes — as an effort to strip away allies of Vance and take him down. (RELATED: The Cold Civil War Is Now on Defrost, and the Right Still Isn’t Ready)\n\nDavidson had that perfectly correct, and everything we’ve seen in the Carlson-Fuentes-Ben Shapiro-Roberts free-for-all on the Right ever since has lined up with his theory.\n\nParticularly when you discount this kerfuffle according to the obvious context, which is that most of the people involved are podcasters and influencers who are trying to stay ahead of an algorithm that rewards controversy and nastiness, whether that algorithm resides on YouTube, Rumble, X, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, or whichever other social media platform through which these guys harvest their clicks.\n\nThis has been blown up into a battle over whether “antisemitism has taken over the Right,” or whether Nick Fuentes is going to be the new Rush Limbaugh, as the conscience of the conservative movement.\n\n. @KevinRobertsTX aligns @Heritage with a demagogue who flatters dictators and scorns allies, and he muzzles Heritage fellows from speaking out. He is dismantling not just a think tank’s reputation but a generation’s work of conservative institution building. @TheSpectator pic.twitter.com/kXWSCxP9Hk— Joel Griffith (@joelgriffith) November 14, 2025\n\nQuin Hillyer: In Tucker Carlson controversy, both sides must expel haters https://t.co/8IHW3HI7f4 via @nolanews Kevin Roberts failed.— Quin Hillyer (@QuinHillyer) November 14, 2025\n\nAll of this is fake. What isn’t fake, though, is that the Republican establishment residing in Washington is desperate to recover its relevance from the MAGA crowd, which makes up the lion’s share of the GOP’s voters.\n\nMost of the MAGA crowd are actually disaffected Bush Republicans. They joined Donald Trump’s coalition for various reasons, but the most prevalent of those is that Bush Republicanism was a fabulous failure.\n\nThere was an interesting debate at X not long ago over whether Reagan conservatism failed…\n\nDid the Conservative movement flop, as many right-oriented populists claim? Just a few policy examples:In 1980, 1 state had a “shall issue” concealed carry law. Today “shall issue” (or no permit) is the rule in all 50 states.In 1980, the top marginal income tax bracket was…— Brad Smith (@CommishSmith) November 11, 2025\n\nLimited government was not preserved, the rule of law wasn’t preserved, individual liberties weren’t preserved, and libertarian market absolutism was used as a shield to defend China methodically destroying our economy. Had “conservatives” made any major inroads in conserving… https://t.co/nZJKc6ZUgV— Wade Miller (@WadeMiller_USMC) November 13, 2025\n\nBut there’s a circle to be squared here, and it’s that Reaganism ended in late January of 1989 as the animating philosophy of the Republican Party, and the Bush “New Coke” version of what became known as conservatism took its place.\n\nAnd it took some time, but the Bush crowd gave away basically everything Reagan won.\n\nWhich is why MAGA ate Bush Republicanism.\n\nAnd MAGA is a coalition of all kinds of people.\n\nAmong them are young Americans and, particularly, young white male Americans. Lots and lots of them.\n\nIf you’re Generation X or older and you’re white and male, what you remember about your teens and 20s is that you’d calibrate your politics in order to get dates. It wasn’t so hard to do, of course; you’d mouth a platitude or two about things like equal pay for equal work, and that would get you in the door most of the time.\n\nBut over two or three or four decades of political, cultural, and even economic decline, everything has changed for the worse where this younger generation is concerned. And the millions of young white males who came together to elect Donald Trump in 2024, despite a profound, deep, and well-placed cynicism about politics and practically everything else, come from a very, very different set of experiences than we older folks have.\n\nWorse experiences. And at the hands, I’m sorry to say, not just of the Left but of the Bush Republicans.\n\nSo it shouldn’t be a shock that the kids will vote for Trump, and probably for Vance, but not for Winsome Earle-Sears or Jack Ciaterrelli.\n\nAnd maybe not for your Republican nominee for Congress next year.\n\nBecause, they ask, what’s the point?\n\nThe sale hasn’t been closed with those kids, you know. They’d vote for Trump because the alternative, Kamala Harris, is the personification of every negative experience most of them have had in America.\n\nShe’s the preachy, incompetent female who insists she’s as good as all the men, when she’s relied on men to elevate her at every stage of her career, not on merit but on something else.\n\nThey didn’t call her Heels Up Harris for nothing, you know.\n\nShe speaks in the kinds of jargony gibberish they’ve had to endure all through an educational experience that turns out to be wholly inadequate to the professional challenges they face in an environment where Corporate America is actively trying to price them out of the job market with foreign workers of every stripe and status imaginable. Not to exclude openly discriminating against them with woke DEI hiring and HR policies. You’ve got to be considerably more hard-working, smarter, and more technically competent as a white man just to get in the door of corporate America today, and once you’re there, you then have to immediately submit to endless arrays of diversity and sensitivity training, struggle sessions, and countless other digs at your character and identity.\n\nInterestingly enough, this has forced many, if not most of them, into the small business world where they then get to experience all the joys of being regulated and jobbed by an economy rigged by the same woke and failing corporations that rejected them in the first place.\n\nOn Thursday, I had the Clay & Buck Show on the radio in my truck, and a caller — an unemployed engineer recently turned out of a corporate job — told the story of a former co-worker who had come to the Chicago firm where he’d worked fresh off the plane from Mumbai. This co-worker, said the caller, had worked it out based on what an apartment cost back home, and the exchange rates that a one-bedroom apartment in Chicago would cost him about $450 a month, and used that mistaken impression in his salary negotiations.\n\nSo he was hired at a pittance, and an American lost his job. And the co-worker then found out he couldn’t make ends meet at the minimum wage salary he’d negotiated and unsurprisingly asked for a raise. The answer? Work at the rate you agreed to, or we’ll have you deported.\n\nThis is what Generation Z is living with. There are 750,000 or so H-1B visa holders here, and in what should be lucrative white-collar jobs, they dominate because they work for almost Third World wages.\n\nH1B’s taking 55% to 86% of entry-level tech jobs.That’s not bringing the best and brightest.

Its experience with academia — run by an educational establishment which is monolithically female and feminist and which has buried masculinity with medication and “zero tolerance” discipline at the lower levels and a plethora of openly cultural Marxist, intersectional curricula at the higher levels, such that young men are increasingly checking out of college altogether — is more negative than any of the preceding generations.\n\nAnd culturally, it’s more disadvantaged than any of its predecessors.\n\nGen Z males were denied a John Wayne, a Chuck Norris, a Sly Stallone, and an Arnold Schwarzenegger. They didn’t even get a Bruce Willis. More of them than any of their predecessors had to grow up without a father figure at all, and had to figure out their masculinity in a mine field.\n\nBut they’ve got access to all the recorded media since Edison. They aren’t ignorant of history. In fact, they know all about John Wayne and Chuck Norris, and it’s not lost on them that those role models, and the American experience of the 1950s through the 1990s, which produced those icons, have been denied them.\n\nOf course they’re angry. And of course they’re resentful. And of course they’re questioning all of these “timeless truths” that the political establishment has insisted they bow to.\n\nSo when an Andrew Tate or Nick Fuentes comes along and offers a transgressive challenge to that orthodoxy and is promptly shouted down and — I use this term advisedly, as I’m simply adopting the argument for conversational purposes — persecuted for the transgression, to many of these kids that’s a signal that the establishment which they blame for destroying the America their grandparents once had fears the transgressors.\n\nAnd they find that sexy.\n\nBecause of course they do. Our generation used to thrive on rebels, not fear them.\n\nSome 40 percent of American women under 45 surveyed by Gallup say they’d leave America if they could. That’s the dating pool these guys live in. They’ve dealt with that kind of rejection all their lives, and it’s why they don’t approach women anymore. Tell them they should try, because the worst that can happen is she’ll say no, and they will give you a reasoned argument why you’re wrong. They can show you the countless TikTok videos of women screeching about the unattractive young man who hit on them and gave them the ick factor, and the social media destruction unlucky young guys lacking in game have endured.\n\nShe can make it a lot worse than just saying no. And if you’ve been given few cultural tools and even worse signals, the chances of it being a lot worse are not zero.\n\nThrow in the dating apps and the horrific swipe left/swipe right binary dating culture is reduced to, plus the outrageous materialism of modern feminism which reduces men to payers of bills (and how the Zoomer guys priced from the workforce by foreign labor when not hunted out of existence in corporate America going to build the kind of equity which gets them on the right side of that equation?) and our Gen Z males are starting to run across the same experience their counterparts in China face, but for different reasons.\n\nChina’s one-child policy resulted in the mass abortions of a huge portion of the female children in the past two generations, so the math doesn’t work out for its younger men. In America, it’s the culture and economics that increasingly don’t work out.\n\nIs it a lost generation? Miraculously, no. But it’s a generation of seekers. They want a way forward, and they’re committed to nothing. Why should they be?\n\nAnd to save America, we’re going to have to lock them into our coalition.\n\nBy whatever means necessary.\n\nThis column isn’t intended to defend Carlson against Shapiro. If that’s what you’re taking from the above, shame on you. Read it again.\n\nNor is it intended to excuse poor attitudes or underperformance.\n\nBut right now, we cannot afford to dismiss anyone as a loser. We need a very big tent. Our opponents in the civil war, which is defrosting in our national microwave, have made it very clear how this all ends if they win. (RELATED: The Four Rings of Terror — How Violence Targets Conservative America)\n\nIt ends in a ditch. With a bullet.\n\nWe’re the ones fighting to keep that all-too-common reality from happening. We sent Charlie Kirk — it’s much fairer to say he sent himself, but our side staked and supported him — to college campuses just to talk to people and win converts.\n\nThey shot him dead for it, and now they offer wisecracks about “kirkholes” on social media as not-so-idle threats in an effort to shut us up. (RELATED: Demons and Demonization)\n\nThis is a fight to save, and maybe restore, some semblance of the America these kids have been denied. And we’ve got to enlist them in this fight when our only real currency with which to do so is that their grievances against the Left are greater than those they harbor for the Bush Republicans.\n\nBy a little bit.\n\nTalk to Kevin Roberts, and he understands this. But they’re trying to get rid of him, just like they’re trying to cancel these other people.\n\nRather than engaging and converting — and then turning out in all the election cycles — the people our coalition can’t win without. And if we can moderate some of the excesses of our new friends, it’ll make us morally superior to the modern Left to boot.\n\nWe don’t have to listen to the Bush Republicans anymore, and we shouldn’t. There is far too much at stake.\n\nREAD MORE from Scott McKay:\n\nThe Dog That Didn’t Bark and the Bombshell That Didn’t Explode\n\nTrump and the GOP Won the Shutdown.

The episode specifically included a clip of Trump telling supporters to march with him and “fight like hell.” However, clips of the president urging supporters to demonstrate peacefully were absent from the program.\n\n Trump’s attorney then issued a letter to the BBC, demanding an apology and threatening to file a $1 billion defamation lawsuit. Additionally, they demanded a “full and fair” retraction of \"Trump: A Second Chance?” and alleged “false, defamatory, disparaging, misleading or inflammatory statements” about Trump.\n\n On Thursday, Nov. 13, the BBC said Chair Samir Shah sent a personal letter to the White House. “We accept that our edit unintentionally created the impression that we were showing a single continuous section of the speech, rather than excerpts from different points in the speech, and that this gave the mistaken impression that President Trump had made a direct call for violent action,\" Shah wrote.\n\n BBC News Director-General Tim Davie and CEO Deborah Turness resigned. Davie acknowledged the mistake and also expressed support for the BBC defending itself in a statement to staff, according to NPR.\n\n However, the BBC is not conceding to Trump's defamation claim. \"While the BBC sincerely regrets the manner in which the video clip was edited, we strongly disagree that there is a basis for a defamation claim,\" the letter reads.\n\n Although Trump has reached settlements with U.S. media companies in recent years, it remains unclear whether this suit can be pursued in the U.K. Defamation damages in the U.K. rarely exceed $132,000. The deadline for the defamation case expired over a year ago.\n\n The recent controversy with the BBC comes after Trump and Paramount reached a $16 million settlement in July. The president sued the media company in October 2024 over CBS News' 60 Minutes interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris, who was running against him for president.\n\n That settlement occurred while the Trump-appointed head of the Federal Communications Commission investigated and threatened to disapprove Paramount’s merger with Skydance Media. The merger was approved weeks after the settlement was announced.\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n In December 2024, ABC News agreed to pay $15 million in charitable contributions to Trump's presidential library after the news outlet and anchor George Stephanopoulos settled a libel lawsuit. Trump accused the journalist and ABC News of defaming him when Stephanopoulos incorrectly stated that Trump was found civilly liable for raping writer E. Jean Carroll. Trump was actually found liable for sexual abuse, a different offense.\n\n In January 2025, Meta agreed to pay $25 million to settle Trump's 2021 lawsuit regarding a previous suspension on its platforms following the Jan. 6 Capitol riots.","summary":"Trump's attorney also demanded a “full and fair” retraction of the \"defamatory\" BBC program","url":"https://people.com/bbc-refuses-to-pay-trump-1-billion-for-editing-jan-6-speech-11850196","image":"https://people.com/thmb/eopfqlA2q-7uRiR4VFNnCZnccmE=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(753x233:755x235)/donald-trump-save-america-rally-2-2021-111425-bab4b859b92d47e49342a16b5e24e1a6.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-11-15 01:02:36","author":"Charna Flam","authors":["Charna Flam"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.273}]}
