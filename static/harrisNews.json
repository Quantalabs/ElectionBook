Oh. Now I love her ad! Is that right? Sydney Sweeney... You'd be surprised how many people are Republicans. If Sydney Sweeney is a registered Republican, I think her ad is fantastic.\"\n\nThe former reality star drooled some more over the Hollywood star, gushing on Truth Social: \"Sydney Sweeney, a registered Republican, has the 'HOTTEST' ad out there. It's for American Eagle, and the jeans are 'flying off the shelves.' Go get 'em, Sydney!\"\n\nSweeney has been feeling the heat after taking part American Eagle jeans ad, which some have labeled \"Nazi-propaganda.\"What's With The Jeans Drama?The ad features Sweeney in the brand's jeans and a denim jacket, as she tells viewers: \"Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color.\"\n\n\"My jeans are blue,\" she adds.\n\nThe commercial left people raging for being a \"Nazi dog whistle,\" as one person at the time said, \"Sydney Sweeney doing everything in her power to cater to the fetishes of white Neo nazi men.\"\n\nWhile Sweeney has yet to comment, the clothing company did so after heavy backlash, saying on their official Instagram: \"Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans' is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story.\n\n\"We’ll continue to celebrate how everyone wears their AE jeans with confidence, their way. Great jeans look good on everyone.\"The Madame Web star has a ton of support, however, especially of the conservative variety. Texas senator Ted Cruz rushed to X during the backlash to praise Sweeney, as he said, \"Wow. Now the crazy Left has come out against beautiful women. I’m sure that will poll well...\"\n\nDemocratic Rep. Eric Swalwell, however, responded and joked: \"Thirsty Ted will defend Sydney Sweeney but won’t defend his own wife against Trump’s smears.\"\n\nIn 2016, then-presidential candidates Cruz and Trump battled it out, with Trump suggesting his rival's wife, Heidi, is unattractive. Cruz was mocked after barely defending Heidi.","summary":"Sydney Sweeney isn't feeling the love from her fellow gender, as she called out women for not supporting her bathwater product.","url":"https://radaronline.com/p/sydney-sweeney-feminists-bathwater-soap-trump-maga/","image":"https://media.radaronline.com/brand-img/gOm8pCicK/0x0/sydney-sweeney-feminists-bathwater-soap-trump-maga2-1755813328112.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 22:30:00","author":"Bryan Brunati","authors":["Bryan Brunati"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.094},{"id":353076696,"title":"Are OpenAI, Google, Meta plotting to take down state AI regulations?","text":"AgenciesAI regulation in the US\n\nUS AI regulation 2025: Tech giants including OpenAI, Meta, and Google are stepping up efforts to block US states from regulating their rapidly growing artificial intelligence businesses, as per a report.Tech Giants Push Back Against State-Level AI RegulationsThese companies are lobbying both the White House and Republican-led Congress, after five states, including Texas, Colorado, California, Tennessee and New York passed significant AI-related laws, as reported by Bloomberg.Kouri Marshall, director of state government relations with tech trade group Chamber of Progress, pointed out that, “Lawmakers should be inviting innovation, not driving it away from the state,” as quoted in the Bloomberg report.

Gretchen Whitmer’s “clean slate” program and has mingled with high-profile Democrats, the Daily Caller News Foundation found. Michigan’s Department of State is now investigating El-Alamin over allegations that he has resided in the neighboring area of Mount Morris Township, where he was arrested in July on domestic violence and assault charges, MLive reported. (RELATED: How Blue City Ex-Felon Given ‘Clean Slate’ Rose To Political Power — Before Getting Arrested Again)\n\nEl-Alamin is accused of beating and choking a woman during a July 10 incident, according to court records and Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton. Police found El-Alamin’s alleged victim with lacerations and bruises on her face and marks on her neck after she said El-Alamin flew into a fit of rage because she was looking at her emails, Leyton said. The alleged victim said in an affidavit that she and El-Alamin were in a romantic relationship and lived together in Mt. Morris Township since June 2023 despite him serving on Flint’s city council, MLive reported.\n\nAn attorney for El-Alamin did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the DCNF.\n\n“These recent allegations are both false and deeply disheartening, but I remain confident in the truth and in the legal process,” El-Alamin said about the criminal case in a July 19 statement on Facebook. His attorney called the residency investigation “another example of malicious city politics,” MLive reported.\n\nThe ex-felon was appointed to the city council in March 2024 to replace a member who died. He later ran for a four-year term and was elected in November with 52% of the vote, and listed in campaign and city records as a resident of a property in Flint’s first ward since at least 2023.\n\nHowever, Flint’s database of property tax records does not list El-Alamin’s name on any property in the city, and Michigan’s sex offender registry shows a female convict living at the specific property instead. The Michigan State Police Sex Offender Registry Unit confirmed to the DCNF that the offender’s address is up-to-date as of July 1. The DCNF could not reach the resident directly.\n\nFlint’s official property portal and property tax database show the sex offender’s house is owned by the Money, Attitude, Direction and Education (MADE) Institute, a nonprofit El-Alamin founded in part to help ex-inmates like himself find housing. The property tax records list the utility billing customer as Abdullah Building Performance Bloc, El-Alamin’s own property management company.\n\nMeanwhile, El-Alamin’s name appears in Mt. Morris Township’s property tax database for a property on the street where El-Alamin’s alleged victim reportedly claims to have lived with him.\n\nThe MADE Institute did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the DCNF. Michigan’s Department of State, Leyton and Flint City Clerk Davina Donahue — who reportedly forwarded the alleged victim’s residency claims to the state — also did not respond to multiple inquiries.\n\nEl-Alamin’s past drug and weapon crimes were expunged after Gov. Whitmer passed a law expanding eligibility in 2020, allowing convicts with up to three felonies and most misdemeanors to qualify. El-Alamin went on to advocate against punitive criminal justice approaches such as incarceration and helped pass a law that prohibits landlords in Flint from factoring someone’s criminal history into rental screenings.\n\n “The ability to expunge these convictions, means an individual’s past mistakes no longer have to impact future plans. We are eager to help residents gain access to the newly expanded expungement process.” @MIAttyGen @dananessel ⬇️https://t.co/WALmIToL7r pic.twitter.com/TLW9UcCiv5 — Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel (@MIAttyGen) May 7, 2021 \n\nBefore his city council term, the ex-felon served on Flint’s federally funded housing commission and a committee advising the city on how to distribute federal COVID-19 relief funds. He also met Whitmer and Democratic members of Congress and attended an event supporting former Vice President Kamala Harris’s 2024 presidential bid, according to photos he has posted on Instagram.\n\nA court freed El-Alamin on July 16, ordered him to wear a GPS monitor and required no contact with his alleged assault victim after he paid a $7,500 bond, court records show. El-Alamin is staying at a new Flint address different from the one at the center of the state’s reported probe, according to a July court order.\n\nThe same woman in the criminal case also filed a child support case against El-Alamin in 2014 that was settled that year, court records show.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Lloyd Doggett, the dean of Texas’ congressional delegation, announced Thursday he would not run for reelection to his Austin-based seat if a new Republican-drawn map is in effect for the 2026 midterms.\n\nDoggett, 78, has represented his hometown of Austin for over 50 years, in both the Legislature and Congress. First elected to Congress in 1994 — the last year Democrats won a statewide race in Texas — he survived numerous Republican redistricting efforts throughout his tenure as the number of Texas Democrats in Congress dwindled.\n\nIn announcing his decision, Doggett is ceding his newly drawn 37th Congressional District, a deep-blue district that encompasses much of Austin, to Rep. Greg Casar. Casar, 36, currently represents the 35th Congressional District, which runs from Austin to San Antonio but is on the verge of being redrawn by Republicans to contain less than 10% of Casar’s current constituency.\n\nTexas Republicans pursued the mid-decade redistricting at the behest of President Donald Trump, crafting new district lines aimed at yielding five more GOP seats in Texas in the 2026 midterms. To do so, Republicans packed as many Democrats into one Austin seat as possible, rather than leaving the city split into two blue districts.\n\nThe new 35th District, shifted to San Antonio and its eastern suburbs, would have voted for President Donald Trump by 10 percentage points in 2024. Doggett did not rule out a run in the 35th District; he used to represent San Antonio, and a group of local Democratic leaders encouraged Doggett in an Austin Chronicle op-ed earlier Thursday to use his $6.2 million war chest to run an uphill race for the new seat.\n\nDoggett and Casar had been inching toward a head-to-head primary in recent weeks, with Doggett making the case — privately to supporters, and publicly — that Casar, who is Latino, should run in the majority-Hispanic 35th Congressional District. Casar never addressed the issue publicly, but an email from his chief of staff to supporters made clear that Casar planned to file for reelection in the Austin-based district, where he lives and which includes his former City Council district.\n\nIn a Thursday statement, Doggett repeated his argument that Casar should run in the San Antonio seat, but acquiesced nonetheless.\n\n“I had hoped that my commitment to reelection under any circumstances would encourage Congressman Casar to not surrender his winnable district to Trump,” Doggett said. “While his apparent decision is most unfortunate, I prefer to devote the coming months to fighting Trump tyranny and serving Austin rather than waging a struggle with fellow Democrats. If [Trump’s] extreme gerrymandering prevails, I wish Congressman Casar the best.”\n\nWith passage in the Texas Senate imminent, the redrawn map is likely to be signed into law soon and challenged by Democratic-aligned groups in court just as quickly. Doggett said that if the “racially gerrymandered Trump map is rejected, as it should be,” then he would continue running in the 37th Congressional District.\n\nThe prospect of a primary between two progressive Democrats had stirred up mixed feelings among Austin’s political class. Several Democrats had pointed out that Doggett was the first Democrat to call on then-President Joe Biden to drop out after his disastrous June debate performance. But Doggett, known for his successful style of retail politics and sitting on a large fundraising advantage, had been committed to running until Thursday.\n\nHis decision eliminates a political headache for House Democratic leadership and fans of both lawmakers in Austin. And it sets Casar, already the chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus in his second term and a rising star on the national political scene, up for a lengthy career representing a district that would have voted for Kamala Harris by 56 percentage points — her biggest margin in all 38 House districts in Texas.\n\n\"Lloyd Doggett is an Austin institution,\" Casar wrote on X, after Doggett announced his decision. \"I've learned so much from him. I'm grateful to him. The fight for democracy continues.\"\n\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15!

We are once again calling on Josh Kraft to stand up for Boston and return these contributions immediately.”\n\nThe law firm has connections to both the Trump administration and the Kraft family. In mid-March, Trump signed an executive order directly targeting the law firm – which, up until that point, was largely Democratic in its leaning. \n\nTo ameliorate the situation, Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots – who has ties to Trump – helped broker a meeting between Trump and the law firm. Paul Weiss serves as the National Football League’s “go-to counsel,” according to their website. \n\nAfter the meeting, Trump rescinded his executive order in March against the law firm and they struck a deal: Paul Weiss would provide $40 million in pro bono work to the administration “to support causes including assisting our Nation’s veterans, fairness in the justice system, and combating anti-Semitism; and other similar initiatives.”\n\nLess than a month after the deal, several Paul Weiss attorneys contributed thousands of dollars to Josh Kraft’s mayoral campaign, according to data from the Office of Campaign and Political Finance.\n\nSeven attorneys at Paul Weiss contributed $7,000 total to Kraft’s mayoral campaign since April 18, campaign finance records show. Each attorney – including from the firm’s chairman, Brad Karp – gave $1,000, the maximum legal limit individuals are allowed to give to candidates per calendar year.\n\nIn a written statement to Boston.com, Kraft said he would resist Wu’s calls to return contributions from Paul Weiss.\n\n“I will not be returning contributions from the individuals at Paul Weiss. Brad Karp in particular is a known Democratic donor and bundler, and raised $100,000 for Vice President Kamala Harris,” he wrote. \n\nHe also volleyed Wu’s demand back to her, urging the mayor to return donations from real estate mogul and former Republican Senator Terry Considine, who Kraft said has contributed thousands of dollars to her. Massachusetts Office of Campaign & Political Finance records show that Considine has contributed $3,000 since 2013.\n\nMayoral candidates Wu, Kraft, Domingos DaRosa, and Robert Cappucci will soon face off in the preliminary election on Sept. 9, which will narrow the race down to two candidates, followed by the general election on Nov. 4.","summary":"The mayor said Kraft’s campaign is “propped up by billionaires and Trump donors,” while Kraft fired back at Wu’s own contributors. \n\n\nThe post Wu calls on Kraft to return contributions from Trump-affiliated law firm appeared first on Boston.com.","url":"https://www.boston.com/news/local-news/2025/08/21/wu-kraft-return-trump-contributions/","image":"https://bdc2020.o0bc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/s3___bgmp-arc_arc-feeds_generic-photos_to-arc_Boston-Mayoral-Forum-491A-68a776b1f34ed-768x432.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 20:37:30","author":"Annie Jonas","authors":["Annie Jonas"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.386},{"id":353049510,"title":"Biden spokesman Ian Sams only met former president twice, Comer says","text":"“This person, Ian Sams, is the one that would counter everything, Robert Hur, or anytime anyone would suggest that Joe Biden wasn’t mentally fit, he would say, ‘No, he’s at the top of his game,'” Comer said.\n\nHur, the former special counsel who investigated Biden’s handling of classified documents, described Biden’s memory lapses in a February 2024 report but declined to pursue criminal charges because of them.\n\nSams testified from 9 a.m. Thursday until just after 12 p.m., at which point he quickly exited without answering any questions from reporters or clarifying Comer’s claims that he only met Biden twice. However, Comer said, “I’ll give Mr. Sams credit; he answered our questions.”\n\n“Robert Hur spent more time with Biden than Sams,” Comer said. “When we would ask, ‘Did Joe Biden tell you this, did Joe Biden send you an email himself?’ Well, no, well, no,” Comer recalled from Sams’s testimony on Thursday.\n\nSams worked in the White House from May 2022 until August 2024, when he joined then-Vice President Kamala Harris‘s presidential campaign. A veteran Democratic operative, Sams previously served in Biden’s Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nComer argued Sams’s testimony undercut his public role. Sams often issued statements and posted online in response to the Oversight Committee’s previous investigations into Biden despite not being remotely close to the former president.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee’s investigation is also examining whether Biden aides improperly used the presidential autopen to authorize certain executive orders and clemency actions.\n\nBIDEN AUTOPEN USE IN DC WAS MORE WIDESPREAD THAN PREVIOUSLY KNOWN\n\nAccording to the Oversight Project, a conservative watchdog group that has obtained National Archives records of Biden’s executive orders, the former president used the autopen on at least eight occasions while he was already in Washington, D.C., to sign various executive orders.\n\nAt least three additional former officials, including former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, are scheduled to testify in the coming weeks.

Gavin Newsom (D).\n\n“Gavin Newscum is way down in the polls. He is viewed as the man who is destroying the once Great State of California. I will save California!!! President DJT,” Trump posted on his TruthSocial platform.\n\nIt is not clear what polls Trump was referring to. Newsom has, in fact, sunk in the highly respected Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC) poll, which showed him enjoying 55% approval among likely voters in February — even after the Los Angeles wildfires — but only 46% in June, after his administration began clashing with Trump. Newsom had a net positive rating of 10% in February, but a net negative of -7% in June.\n\nThe Hill estimated Newsom in even bigger trouble, at -22.2%, with a mere 27% favorable rating nationwide.\nAnother poll found that Newsom was enjoying a “bump” over potential rivals such as former Vice President Kamala Harris, thanks to his recent trolling of President Trump, and his push to gerrymander California’s congressional districts in response to Republican redistricting in Texas.\n\nBut Californians, reeling from the wildfires, budget deficits, and the nation’s highest unemployment rate, may be less impressed — especially since Democrats would lost more seats if every Republican state were to retaliate against Newsom’s gambit.\n\nTrump owns property in California, including the highly esteemed Trump National Golf Club in Rancho Palos Verdes, and visited the state in his first week in office in a show of solidarity with local wildfire victims.\n\nJoel B.

When pressed about the existence of a side deal, he said: “I do not want to politicize our company in any way shape or form. We want to obviously speak to the biggest audience possible.”\n\nWhen asked about whether Ellison is concerned the FCC would take action if the ombudsman finds bias, Ellison said, “I don’t think it’ll get to that.”\n\n“We want to be path-based and truth-based [as] a news organization. That’s what we’re about. That’s the legacy of CBS,” he added.\n\nNew president Jeff Shell added the ombudsman is a “transparency vehicle, not an oversight vehicle,” clarifying that the process at Paramount is not being “overseen by the FCC or anybody else.”\n\n“We do believe in transparency, both in the news division and, frankly, in every other business that we’re in — that’s why we’re here today, our first day of the first couple hours,” Shell said. “The second thing that’s very important is it’s an internal process. Of course, people from the outside can utilize it, but it’s internal. It’s meant to be something where George [Cheeks] and I can work with the leadership if … people think there’s bias, or they think there’s things that are done wrong in reporting to see if something was done or not done, and see if any correct action needs to be taken.”\n\nIn addition to Pallone, Jr. and Raskin, other lawmakers who have called out the Trump settlement and have sent New Paramount letters demanding answers include Sen. Adam Schiff, and Sens.

It's a perhaps inevitable technological advance cemented in place by President Donald Trump's bombastic use of the medium. But if Trump set the template for modern social media politicking, it's California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) who has emerged most recently as the Democrats' leading online gladiator, in large part by conspicuously mocking the president's digital cadence and mannerisms.\n\nHAS ANYONE NOTICED THAT SINCE I SAID “I HATE KID ROCK” HE'S NO LONGER 'HOT?' — GCNAugust 20, 2025\n\nNOT EVEN JD “JUST DANCE” VANCE CAN SAVE TRUMP FROM THE DISASTROUS MAPS “WAR” HE HAS STARTED.

At the same time, Newsom's embrace of the president's coarse messaging has agitated conservatives and some liberals alike — even as the governor takes their opprobrium as proof positive that his social media tactics are working.\n'Entering the fray is both messy and worth it'\nNewsom's Trumpified social media feed has earned attention \"from all ends of the media,\" and succeeded at \"energizing Democrats eager to see members of their party fight back at the president,\" The Hill said. Within the party, Newsom \"in particular\" is demonstrating that he will \"go as low as he needs to to take on Trump,\" said Democratic strategist and former Kamala Harris Communications Director Jamal Simmons to the outlet. He \"isn't just trolling MAGA,\" said digital strategist and former Pete Buttigieg Online Engagement Director Stefan Smith to Politico.

The governor's office claims there has been an \"influx\" of \"more than 325,000 followers\" to his @GovPressOffice account since Newsom began his new social media strategy, said SFGate. The response to Newsom's first Trump-inflected post this month (initially intended as a \"one-time joke\") was \"overwhelming compared with previous posts,\" said The New York Times.\nBy creating an \"edgy resistance\" through his online appropriation of Trump's social media style, Newsom is \"essentially acknowledging that many of Trump's tactics are effective,\" Axios said. Despite \"valid reasons to despise what Newsom is doing,\" said Nick Catoggio at The Dispatch, \"for now, against my better judgment, I'm enjoying it\" thanks in large part to the fact that Newsom's posts \"are legitimately funny.\" In an America that's \"rapidly declining,\" Catoggio said, a \"troll who's good at trolling\" can absolutely \"get elected president. And has.\"\n'He has to be a little bit more serious'\n\"I don't know\" what Newsom is \"trying to do,\" said Fox News host Trace Gallagher, \"but it comes across as childish.\" Newsom is a \"vile piece of shit,\" said White House Communications Director Steven Cheung after one of Newsom's posts warned the president of \"THE WORST DAY OF YOUR LIFE AS YOUR PRESIDENCY ENDS (DEMS RETAKE CONGRESS!)\" Given the longstanding rumors of Newsom's 2028 presidential ambitions, if he \"wants an even bigger job, he has to be a little bit more serious,\" said Fox News host and former George W.

Vance or Secretary of State Mark Rubio, and then going off to the Anchorage summit with Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin.\n\nBoth his prediction and his trip were about legacy, for while the trip was help build his reputation, carefully promoted in his present term while his prediction recognizes the fact that while he will personally come to the end of his political career at the end of his current term, his political machine will remain in existence, and is a valuable legacy for whoever gets a piece of it.\n\nThe prediction is in a way more typical of Trump’s style of politics, both domestic and foreign. The recent summit showed him trying to make peace between Russia and Ukraine, but when the action shifted to Washington, it seemed Ukraine was not ready to come on board.\n\nAs for his prediction, it is useful to remember that Trump may well be bigger than the Republican party, and certainly likes to think so. Crucial to his ability to transfer his machine will be the midterm elections next year, when he will once again be tested. The renomination he received in 2024, after his defeat in 2020, was the result of the power he showed in the 2022 midterms, when he showed that his endorsement counted, not in the general election against the Democrat nominee, but in the Republican primary.\n\nThe result has been the imposition of more uniformity on the party than before. This is not really an imposition, so much as a reflection of what the Republican party now stands for. Unlike modest other populist figures, Trump does not really offer anything, but does indicate to the voter who can be trusted and who cannot. This might help explain his apparent untouchability by scandal: while that would be fatal for someone of whom something is expected, it is forgiven by voters and supporters for whom he is fulfilling a wish.\n\nThat means that every act of racism, every act of misogyny, every display of ignorance, is forgiven by voters who secretly wish to be able to voice any of these things, but dare not. It is worth seeing whether Trump’s connection with the late Jeffrey Epstein will outdo this, because Epstein, who was convicted of paedophilia, and who died in prison in 2019, was seen by Trump supporters as one figure in an alleged paedophilia ring. The Biden Administration is alleged to have covered up the facts revealed by the investigation after he died, because of the large number of Democrat leaders who would be revealed as Epstein companions.\n\nInstead of releasing the information collected, it seems the Trump Administration is now sitting on the evidence collected. A recent newspaper report has indicated that Trump’s relationship with Epstein was closer than he has admitted so far. That would mean that Trump is part of the elite that he has led the fight against. In the midst of all this, he has created rivals for the succession, Vice President J.D. Vance and Secretary of State Mark Rubio, who hold positions that lead to the Presidency. It is easier for Vice Presidents, who have only to preside over the Senate, to plug in to the fund-raising machine that is needed in recent times, Vice-Presidents have had a better chance. Discounting Teddy Roosevelt, Calvin Coolige, Harry Truman, Lyndon Johson and Gerald Ford, who were sitting Vice-Presidents who became President after their principal died on them, Vice-Presidents have done well in the last century or so.\n\nDwight Eisenhower’s Vice-President Richard Nixon lost immediately after, in 1960, to Kennedy, but won the nomination and Presidency in 1968. Nixon’s Vice President, Gerald Ford, lost in 1976, but won the nomination, though after a strong challenge from Ronald Reagan. Reagan himself won in 1980. Reagan’s Vice-President, George Bush, won in 1988. Jimmy Carter’s Vice-President lost to Reagan in 1976. Al Gore, Clinton’s Vice-President, lost in 2000. George Bush’s Vice-President, Dan Quayle, ran in 2000, but failed to win the nomination, withdrawing early in favour of the younger Bush. Bush’s Vice-President, Peter Cheyney, never ran for President, having two huge disadvantages. His daughter had come out as gay, and he had had a multiple coronary bypass.\n\nTrump controls the Republican Party like no one as ever before. Peace in Ukraine is almost a sideshow as the world now focuses on who will inherit his mantle, or rather be given it.\n\nObama’s Vice-President, Joe Biden, contested in 2016, but did not win the nomination. He tried again in 2020, and won not just the nomination, but the Presidency. He did not contest in 2024, even though he had won nomination, and left his Vie-President, Kamala Harris, to do so instead. She joined the list of Vice-Presidents who lost.\n\nTrump is unusual in that he won, then lost, then won again. The only other example is Grover Cleveland, who won in 1888, lost in 1892, then won in 1896. His first vie-president, Thomas Hendricks, died in office. At that time, a vacancy in the vice-presidency was left vacant, and it was only in the 20th century that the President was allowed to fill the office by nomination. Trump probably wished that his first Vice-President, Mark Pence, had suffered Hendricks’ fate. Cleveland’s second Vice-President, Adlai Stevenson, was the Democratic nominee in 1900, but went down to defeat. Interestingly, Stevenson’s grandson, Adlai Stevenson II, was the Democratic nominee in 1952 and 1956, losing both times to Eisenhower. That precedent indicates that Vance should get the nomination, but be beaten.\n\nThough James Madison, and then James Munroe and John Quincy Adams were respectively the fourth, fifth and sixth Presidents after having been Secretary of State to their predecessors, this emphasis on foreign affairs was set aside when the populist Andrew Jackson was elected President in place of Secretary of State Henry Clay. After that, no Secretary of State, serving or former, even ran for President., until Hillary Clinton, who wanted to qualify herself, apparently feeling that having been First Lady was not enough. First she was elected Senator from New York, then she was Secretary of State during Barack Obama’s first term, leaving in his second to prepare to campaign in 2016. She won the party nomination, but lost the election. Interestingly, the man who beat her, Donald Trump, had never held any public office before, either elected or appointed.\n\nBy naming Vance and Rubio, Trump has set up the classic successor’s syndrome, whereby monarchs detests their crown princes. Historically, this problem has afflicted all monarchies, with heirs apprent having a propensity to rebel. Rebellions have been mounted against fathers, often successfully, but in Trump’s case this might not happen, for the heir apparent would need Trump’s approval.\n\nThere are two problems. First, there is the would-be successor who does not win Trump’s final approval. Should he rebel? Maybe Trump will leave the decision to the voter. After all, the legacy consists of the voters, and if the voters refuse to vote for the anointed successor, then the legacy disappears. Vance has an Indian wife, while Rubio is Hispanic, which will not resonate with the base, which is racist if it could be frank about it.\n\nThen there is the family. Trump’s eldest daughter was active in his first-term, but has faded. Donald Trump, Jr, his eldest son, but without a high-profile role, has not ruled out the possibility of running, but not in 2028. It is almost as if he is going by George W. Bush playbook, leaving Vance a shot, and then staking his claim in 2032.\n\nTrump controls the Republican Party like no one as ever before. Peace in Ukraine is almost a sideshow as the world now focuses on who will inherit his mantle, or rather be given it.","summary":"AT PENPOINT US President Donald Trump had first set off something of a bombshell in Washington, saying that he expected to be succeeded by either Vice-President J.D.

After all, no American thinks it is appropriate that she serve during this time with a cloud hanging over her.”\nUS President Donald Trump has discussed firing Cook, according to a White House official familiar, but that is not under active consideration. Trump would prefer to see Cook resign or be fired by Powell, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorised to speak publicly on the issue.\nPowell does not have the legal authority to fire Cook, a Senate-confirmed presidential appointee. Only the president can remove a Fed governor and only for cause.\nCook on Wednesday said she intended to remain at the central bank, after Trump called for her resignation.\n\n“I have no intention of being bullied to step down from my position because of some questions raised in a tweet,” Cook said in an emailed statement via a Fed spokesperson.\n“I do intend to take any questions about my financial history seriously as a member of the Federal Reserve and so I am gathering the accurate information to answer any legitimate questions and provide the facts.”\nA resignation would create another opening for Trump to fill on the Fed board as the president piles pressure on the central bank to lower rates.\nTrump has tarnished Fed Chair Jerome Powell as “Too Late” for not slashing rates months ago, and suggested he too should step aside. Trump has also heavily criticised Powell and the Fed over the cost of its ongoing headquarters renovation project.\nFederal Housing Finance Agency Director Bill Pulte wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi and Martin on August 15 suggesting that Cook may have committed a criminal offence.\nThe letter alleged that Cook “falsified bank documents and property records to acquire more favourable loan terms, potentially committing mortgage fraud under the criminal statute”.\nCook became the first black woman to serve on the Fed’s Board of Governors in Washington when she was appointed by US President Joe Biden in 2022. Her term expires in 2038.\nMartin did not immediately respond to a message left for comment. The Federal Reserve declined to comment.\n“As we begin any investigation of the conduct like that by Ms Cook in the referral, I will likely be required for confidentiality purposes to remain silent about our investigations,” Martin wrote in the letter to the Fed chair.\n\nHer departure would give Trump an opportunity to secure a four-person majority on the seven-member board after another Biden appointee, Adriana Kugler, announced on August 1 that she would vacate her position early. Kugler’s term was set to expire in January.\nTwo other governors, Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman, were appointed during Trump’s first term.\nDuring her initial confirmation process, Cook faced intense scrutiny from Republican lawmakers and conservative media outlets who accused her of misrepresenting parts of her resume and tried to use that to sink her nomination.\nShe strongly denied the allegations and was confirmed on a party-line vote in the Senate, with then-US Vice-President Kamala Harris stepping in to break a 50-50 tie.\nAs a governor, Cook has held a permanent seat on the Federal Open Market Committee, the group of 12 policymakers that votes on monetary policy decisions. The panel also includes five presidents from the Fed’s 12 regional banks.\nCook has expressed worry over inflation and tariffs this year, but also said in early August that the July jobs report was “concerning” and could indicate a potential turning point for the US economy. The central bank is expected to cut its benchmark rate when it next gathers in September.","summary":"The US Justice Department signalled possible plans to investigate Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, with a top official informing Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell of the probe and encouraging him to remove her from the board in a letter sent on Thursday.\nEd Martin, a Justice Department official who has led similar investigations into Senator Adam Schiff of California and New York Attorney General Letitia James, told Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell that Cook’s case “requires further...","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3322713/us-justice-department-investigate-federal-reserves-lisa-cook-urges-her-removal","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2025/08/22/93d602b2-ad42-4d21-88ac-fcf1faba4704_f68e2930.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 18:03:43","author":"Bloomberg","authors":["Bloomberg"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":-0.366},{"id":353012556,"title":"Kamala Harris announces international book tour for new memoir 107 Days","text":"Washington DC [US], August 21 (ANI): Former US Vice President Kamala Harris will go on a 15-city book tour across the U.S., Canada and England for her new memoir, 107 Days, according to a press release, reported by People. 107 Days recounts the “intense, high-stakes and deeply personal” period of Harris’ 2024 Democratic presidential campaign, following President Joe Biden withdrawing from his reelection campaign.“Since leaving office, I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on those days and with candor and reflection, I’ve written a behind-the-scenes account of that journey,” Harris said in her initial July 31 video announcement. “I believe there’s value in sharing what I saw, what I learned and what it will take to move forward.”Harris is going to multiple cities across the United States, as well as stops in Ontario and London.

But Gabbard has also framed the changes as part of her campaign to crush “the deep state,” a term she has used to describe civil servants and appointees from previous administrations that she sees as opposed to President Donald Trump’s policies.\n\nThe Foreign Malign Influence Center, created by Congress in 2022, coordinates efforts across intelligence agencies to monitor threats to elections and public debate. During the last election, intelligence officials held regular briefings to warn of attempts by Russia and other countries to manipulate the vote in the United States.\n\nThe center also issued warnings about deepfake videos that spread false information about Vice President Kamala Harris, and about videos from Russia that sought to spread false claims about damaged ballots and illegal voting.\n\nBut Republicans have criticized the Biden administration’s election-defense efforts, saying that its attempts to counter foreign disinformation curtailed the free speech rights of conservatives. Early in the second Trump administration, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency shut down its election-defense efforts, while Attorney General Pam Bondi ordered the FBI to dismantle its malign influence task force.\n\nEven though the Foreign Malign Influence Center was created long after the 2016 presidential election, Gabbard has been deeply critical in recent weeks of its examination that year of Russian election interference. She has said the 2016 assessment was flawed, and has accused Obama administration officials of a “treasonous conspiracy,” comments that have earned Trump’s praise.\n\nBecause the center was created by Congress, it is difficult for Gabbard to eliminate it outright. Instead, the memo said she would fold its operations into another part of her office, called Mission Integration, that oversees national intelligence officers.\n\nThe reorganization plan also shrinks two other centers and folds them into the Mission Integration office. One of the centers is dedicated to cybersecurity, and the other focuses on chemical, biological and nuclear threats.\n\nIn a social media post Wednesday afternoon, Gabbard said her reorganization plan was a first step toward making her office more efficient and agile, saving taxpayers $700 million a year and “rooting out deep state actors.”\n\nThe memo said that the National Intelligence University, which is akin to a military war college that trains midcareer intelligence professionals, would enroll its final students in the fall. Over the course of the school year, it would move its academic programs to the National Defense University and other government schools. The National Intelligence University, based in Bethesda, Maryland, will close no later than June 1, the memo said.\n\nThe proposal immediately generated criticism on Capitol Hill among Democrats, many of whom were concerned about Gabbard’s decision Tuesday to revoke the security clearances of 37 current and former national security officials, including two Senate staff members. Many of those affected had worked on Russia analysis or foreign threats to U.S. elections.\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence was in need of “thoughtful reform,” and that he and his colleagues would review her plan.\n\n“But given Director Gabbard’s track record of politicizing intelligence — including her decision just yesterday to revoke security clearances from career national security officials — I have no confidence that she is the right person to carry out this weighty responsibility,” Warner said.\n\nGabbard’s office said that so far, she had decreased the number of employees at the office from 1,800 to 1,300, a figure reported earlier by Newsmax. According to the memo to Congress, Gabbard’s office was extending voluntary early retirement until March 31 to further shrink the workforce.\n\n“It is my commitment to you, and my charge to the ODNI leadership team, that we will continue to drive efficiencies across the organization,” Gabbard wrote in the memo.\n\nThis article originally appeared in The New York Times.\n\n© 2025 The New York Times Company","summary":"WASHINGTON >> Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, announced Wednesday that she would reorganize her office, eliminating the National Defense University and shrinking the Foreign Malign Influence Center, which tracked efforts by adversarial countries to manipulate U.S. elections.","url":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/2025/08/21/breaking-news/gabbard-to-scale-back-election-threat-monitoring-efforts/","image":"https://www.staradvertiser.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/web1_20250821_brk_tul01.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 18:00:00","author":"New York Times","authors":["New York Times"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.066},{"id":353041534,"title":"Trump Blasts Letitia James, Arthur Engoron After Civil Fraud Penalty Thrown Out: 'Political Witch Hunt'","text":"TOTAL VICTORY in the FAKE New York State Attorney General Letitia James Case! I greatly respect the fact that the Court had the Courage to throw out this unlawful and disgraceful Decision that was hurting Business all throughout New York State. Others were afraid to do business there. The amount, including Interest and Penalties, was over $550 Million Dollars. It was a Political Witch Hunt, in a business sense, the likes of which no one has ever seen before. This was a Case of Election Interference by the City and State trying to show, illegally, that I did things that were wrong when, in fact, everything I did was absolutely CORRECT and, even, PERFECT. Every single Dollar was thrown out, even the penalties imposed on us by the Corrupt Judge, one of the most overturned in History, Arthur Engoron. I wasn’t given a Jury and, during the course of the Trial, which lasted a long time, was not given one Ruling in my favor by this Political Hack, but worse than him, if that’s possible, was Letitia James, a Corrupt and Incompetent Attorney General who only brought this Case in order to hurt me politically. She is a Trump Deranged Lunatic! They made me bond the outrageous sum, which never happened before, and which cost me Millions of Dollars a month. It should have never been allowed to happen, and everyone knew it! Importantly, the Vote was 5 to 0. I am so honored by Justice David Friedman’s great words of wisdom, which should be read by everyone. I would also like to thank the Court for having the Courage to make this Decision, which is already going down as one of the worst business persecutions in the History of our Country.\n\nSadly, there are other Cases against me that are equally disgraceful, including those headed up by Corrupt Judges, like Juan Merchan, whose daughter collected Millions of Dollars in Fees from Crooked Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, while her father shockingly REFUSED TO RECUSE himself from a vicious and corrupt trial, which is also under Appeal, one in which every Legal Pundit in New York said, “THERE WAS NO CASE!” — Even Editorial Boards said, “DO NOT DO THIS!” Judge Merchan gave me an unprecedented Gag Order, not letting me talk about him or his daughter, or the fact that the Appellate Judges thought he should not be doing the Case, but he did it anyway. Many Lawyers said that his daughter and him created the Greatest Conflict of Interest they had ever seen. Judge Lewis Kaplan, the other remaining Case, whose wife, family, and friends attended his two trials, is as mean and nasty as anyone I have ever met. That Case, also on Appeal, should also never have been brought, and he should be admonished for Abuse, and every other thing that can be thrown at a Corrupt Judge. He loved the publicity, and would not let us present the irrefutable evidence that we wanted to present. This Clinton appointed Judge should not be allowed to get away with this SCAM…\n\nThese were all Political Trials in an effort to destroy my viability as a Presidential Candidate before, during, and after the Election. They were strongly coordinated with the Biden/Harris Campaign, and will go down in History as among the most Corrupt Cases ever brought. These two Cases are even more ridiculous than the Corrupt Letitia James Case, and will be found out to be so in the very near future. All of these Judges should be ashamed of themselves for allowing them to happen. They are Political Hacks who did everything possible to hurt me as a Candidate. This was an attack by the Biden/Harris Administration on their Political Opponent, ME.

The Tesla boss did his best to have the suit dismissed, listing \"red flags\" as proof he had not run the alleged illegal lottery.\n\nHowever, U.S. District Judge Robert Pitman, who was appointed by President Obama in 2014, pointed to other statements suggesting the defendants were \"awarding\" the money, and that the $1million could be \"won.\"\n\n\"It is plausible that plaintiff justifiably relied on those statements to believe that defendants were objectively offering her the chance to enter a random lottery, even if that is not what they subjectively intended to do,\" the judge expressed.The Lottery's Impact On The ElectionWhile Musk claimed voters who signed were not negatively impacted by providing their contact information, the judge said a political data brokerage will respond under oath to what the information for worth for voters.\n\nThe World's Richest Man did all he could to help Trump beat Kamala Harris in November, introducing his \"lottery,\" but not everyone was on board with the idea, especially Philadelphia district attorney Lawrence Krasner, who aimed to block Musk's contest.\n\n\"l'll be seeking a lot more money than that for what Elon Musk and America PAC have done,\" Krasner said.\n\nHowever, Pennsylvania judge Angelo Foglietta ruled Musk's sweepstakes was not illegal at the time.What's The America Party?Despite Musk spending all his time hyping up the politician, just months into Trump's second presidential term, he did a major 180, claiming he would be forming another party, titled the America Party, giving people their \"freedom\" back.\n\n\"When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,\" Musk said. The idea came as Musk was bashing Trump's \"big, beautiful bill,\" claiming it would add trillions to the U.S. national debt.\n\nEven though Musk has since backed off from the America Party, Vice President JD Vance responded in a recent interview on The Ingraham Angle, reminding the businessman to stay in Trump's corner.\"My advice to Elon would be to try to fix the Republican Party,\" Vance told the Fox News personality. \"Try to push it in your own way. Disagree with me all you want, disagree with the president of the United States, but don't pretend that you can make a big difference with a third party.\"\n\nHe continued: \"I think Elon would make a much bigger difference if he stayed loyal to President Trump's Republican Party, and if he had disagreements, express those disagreements from the inside as opposed from the outside.\"","summary":"Elon Musk will now have to defend himself against a lawsuit claiming he ran an illegal election lottery to try and get Trump elected

the CEO of its owner Comcast as “dopey.”\n\n“MSNBC is doing so poorly in the ratings that they are looking to change their name in order to get away from the stench of their fake news product,” Trump wrote in a late-night tirade on Truth Social, his social media platform, in all capital letters.\n\n“So much fun to watch their weak and ineffective owner, ‘Concast,’ headed by dopey Brian Roberts, hopelessly and aimlessly flailing in the wind in an attempt to disassociate itself from the garbage that they created!”\n\nNBCUniversal did not immediately respond to The Post’s request for comment.\n\nOwner Comcast is forcing MSNBC to take a new name and stripping the left-leaning network of NBC’s iconic peacock symbol as it carries out a $7 billion spinoff of its cable assets.\n\nMark Lazarus, who will lead Versant, the new publicly-traded company consisting of MSNBC, CNBC and other cable assets, announced the rebrand to MS NOW – short for My Source News Opinion World.\n\n“As we all know, the peacock is synonymous with NBCUniversal, and it is a symbol they have decided to keep within the NBCU family,” he said in a memo Monday morning.\n\nThe new acronym was mercilessly mocked online, with social media users quipping that it stands for “Majorly Skewed News Overly Woke” or “Most Surely No One Watching.”\n\nSome started calling the network – home to anti-Trump anchors like Rachel Maddow – “BS NOW” while others joked that the standalone “MS” looked like a reference to multiple sclerosis. \n\nThe president has long railed against MSNBC and its liberal news anchors, often using the nickname “MSDNC” – a dig that the network is a megaphone for Democratic Party leaders.\n\nEarlier this year, he went so far as to slam MSNBC as a “threat to our democracy” and questioned whether the news outlet should “even have a right to broadcast.”\n\nTrump has also taken aim at mainstream news outlets like ABC and CBS. \n\nHe secured a $15 million payment from ABC News toward his presidential library to settle a defamation suit, and reached a $16 million settlement with CBS owner Paramount over a “60 Minutes” interview with Kamala Harris — though he expects a larger sum.\n\nMeanwhile, MSNBC staffers are likely surprised by the rebrand after Lazarus earlier this year assured that the cable news channel would be able to hold onto its name.\n\n“I know there was some discussion with the MSNBC name, so you can take that off of your worry list on things,” Lazarus told staffers during a meeting in January.\n\nA company insider told The Post that it “doesn’t set a great precedent for management to change the name after promising staffers it wouldn’t.”\n\n“It’s not a way to boost trust in the new company and its leadership.”","summary":"Owner Comcast is forcing

Harris last month described the book as “a journal” that will recount that abbreviated run that was launched after then-President Joe Biden abruptly dropped out of the race.\n“During these special events, Harris will share what she saw, what she learned, and what it will take to move forward,” book publisher Simon & Schuster wrote in a press release. Most of the sessions are scheduled to be held in theatres and music halls, with moderators for the events yet to be announced by the organisers.\nSeveral small and independently owned bookstores will be partnering with Harris in cities along the tour, which was an intentional move by the former vice president, according to a source familiar with her plans.\nAccording to NBC News’ source, Haris expanded the tour to include more “untraditional” markets like Portland, Oregon, and Durham, North Carolina, and that it’s possible she makes additional surprise visits around formal book events.\nAlthough several events are planned in traditionally conservative states such as Texas, Tennessee, and Alabama, the tour is expected to intensify speculation about Harris’ political future.\nThe former vice president, in July, announced she would not enter the 2026 race for California governor. “I don’t want to go back in the system,” she explained in an interview on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.”\n“I want to travel the country,” Harris told the late-night host, adding: “I want to listen to people, I want to talk with people, and I don’t want it to be transactional, where I’m asking for their vote.”\nTwo sources close to Harris told NBC News last month that she was looking to keep an option open to run for president again in 2028.\nThe book’s publisher announced that tickets will go on sale Friday, including “VIP Meet & Greet” options that offer a photo with Harris and a signed copy of her book.","summary":"Kamala Harris launches a 15-city book tour for her memoir 107 Days, spanning New York, San Francisco, Toronto, London, and Miami, sparking speculation about her political future.","url":"https://www.news18.com/world/kamala-harris-announces-to-hit-15-cities-including-toronto-london-for-107-days-book-tour-ws-l-9520444.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/08/Untitled-design-2025-08-356271cf7e4d8671a2ff0a82d7fdbadc.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 17:09:39","author":"Aanchal Sinha,News18","authors":["Aanchal Sinha","News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.17},{"id":352995592,"title":"Gavin Newsom’s ‘brat summer’ redux","text":"In just his first three years as the Golden State’s governor, Gavin Newsom (D-CA) granted nearly 200,000 new standard driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants and renewed another 600,000 under a process even more lax than the one that gave the functionally illiterate Singh a license to drive an 18-ton commercial vehicle across state lines. And yet, in a Very Online Campaign on the Left, Newsom is being touted as the Democratic Party’s path out of the wilderness.\n\nCalifornia has the highest unemployment rate and the highest local inflation rates of any other state in the Union. But Newsom evidently memes really hard. With a team of millennials managing his press office account on X, Newsom has spent the last week trying to evoke Trump, deeming himself “AMERICA’S FAVORITE GOVERNOR” and mocking Bed Bath & Beyond for moving all operations out of California.\n\n“It was intended as a one-time joke, according to his office, but the response was overwhelming compared with previous posts,” reported the New York Times in a laudatory profile of Newsom’s latest attempt to garner attention. “The governor’s communications team — four core members and a couple of others who chime in — decided to keep going.”\n\nNewsom’s personal X brigade, embracing the banner of “dark woke,” hasn’t exactly hidden his decadeslong presidential ambitions, juxtaposing the Democrat with Vice President JD Vance.\n\nAnd the strategy has not only come from anonymous accounts but also directly from Newsom’s account.\n\nThe August air may be giving way to a crisp whisper of fall, but make no mistake: The latest attempt to astroturf Newsom into some sort of populist champion and popular jock to take on Vance is no different than a redux of 2024’s gambit to delude the nation into believing that Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) was cool and Vance was weird. In other words, this is just a redux of “brat summer.”\n\nDemocrats are not wrong to panic. More than a year after the party coup ousted former President Joe Biden from the top of the ticket, Democrats are more unpopular than they have ever been in this century. Last month, the Wall Street Journal cited a CNBC poll that revealed the highest share, 63%, in 35 years of voters who view the Democratic Party unfavorably. Earlier this month, the same poll found that Trump maintains a 46% approval rating, while the Democratic Party’s approval rating is exactly half that.\n\nFrom 2020 to 2024, Democrats lost registered voters to Republicans in every one of the 30 states that allow partisan registration, with a net 4.5 million voter swing to the GOP. Trump’s landmark gains with black and Hispanic voters haven’t seen any level of catastrophic erosion in his approval polls just yet, and Republicans are continuing to gain with men even as the Democratic consolidation of female support has stagnated.\n\nTo listen to the most livid of liberals, the problem is not that the party isn’t fighting hard enough but that it doesn’t look like it’s fighting hard enough. The “dark woke” strategy of spitting out more swear words and men copying Vance’s beard doesn’t have much to say about policy, but it does about pathos. When “they go low,” Democrats are no longer following the graceful guidance of former first lady Michelle Obama to “go high.”\n\nInstead, in the words of Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-CA), Democrats are “going to bury” the GOP.\n\nThere are a couple of facets to this strategy that don’t stand strong under scrutiny. The first, in particular to Newsom and his one-sided war with Vance, is that Democrats have already tried this before.\n\nFrom April through August, Vance has maintained a net -6.7% favorability rating. That’s on par with what former Vice President Kamala Harris enjoyed at this point in her term and astronomically better than the near net -20% favorability rating that haunted her for most of the rest of her time in the vice presidency. This is, in turn, slightly better than the more than net -20% favorability Newsom scored in the run-up to Election Day in 2024.\n\nAnd recall that the last time Democrats went all in on the “Vance Is Weird” gimmick, it resulted in Vance being the only candidate of the four names at the top of the ticket to head into election night with a positive favorability. Next to Walz and Harris, voters simply did not buy “Vance Is Weird.” Now, put the Ohio father, arguably the first running mate to pass the beer test in at least my lifetime, next to Newsom, the pampered scion of the Getty family, and Vance is not just weird; he is arguably the only normal main character in the dystopian drama that is the shadow 2028 election.\n\nThe other issue is the Left’s obsession with relitigating political strategy as an intentional distraction from the reality that voters don’t just hate the brand; they hate Democratic policies.\n\nAs we’ve discussed before, Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson have tried to give the Left a policy lifeline with the Abundance Agenda. But no major party leader has taken on the project in a substantive pivot away from the Biden legacy. And the knee-jerk response to Trump indicates that most Democrats are as beholden to Biden’s policies as ever, even if they threw their old man under the bus.\n\nTrump has maintained uncharacteristic discipline in mostly focusing on deporting the worst-of-the-worst illegal immigrants. Some 70% of those illegal immigrants arrested by the Trump administration were already convicted of or had pending charges for another crime. Yet Democrats couldn’t wait to rally around suspected MS-13 member and accused wife-beater Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Hamas supporter Mahmoud Khalil. If you don’t want to deport these two, do you actually want to deport anyone?\n\nAnother weird thing about the “#Resistance” this time is that it hasn’t taken the actual chance to reclaim Congress’s power from not just Trump, but from the president, permanently. The Constitution explicitly reserves the power “to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises” for Congress, not the president. Yet Democrats haven’t extended any real olive branches to the anti-tariff libertarians such as Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) or Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) to end Trump’s unilateral imposition of the largest tariff hike on U.S. citizens in a century. Similarly, Congress passed and Biden signed a law requiring that TikTok be banned earlier this year at the absolute latest unless the social media giant’s domestic operations were offloaded from the control of the Chinese Communist Party. But Trump has illegally refused to enforce this law.\n\nEven the “Make America Healthy Again” madness has gone mostly ignored by Democrats. They could be rallying everyone from cancer survivors to autism awareness advocates off the partisan sidelines in response to Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s fact-free fearmongering about the disproven link between MMR vaccines and autism and his singlehanded crackdown on mRNA research for fatal and chronic conditions.\n\nAlas, it is easier to meme than to govern. This round of “Newsom Is A Straight Rich White Man Who Is Cool Actually” is no different than Harris’s coconut trees, “Kamala Is Brat,” or “Vance Is Weird.” The goal is not to fight against Trump or even the imperial presidency as an institution. Democrats only want to look like they’re fighting, and Newsom looks enough like a cartoon villain to pull it off for this news cycle.","summary":"Earlier this month, a minivan was driving north out of St. Lucie County on the Florida Turnpike when a commercial semitruck hauling a box trailer crossed directly in front of it.

His testimony contributed to the committee’s investigation into the cover-up of Biden’s physical and cognitive decline throughout his presidency and reelection campaign.\n\n“Listen, I want to say this one more time so everyone understands. Ian Sams, who was the White House spokesperson for a significant time of Joe Biden’s time as president, only interacted with him two times. Two times,” Comer told reporters. (RELATED: Ex-White House Advisor Stonewalls Reporter On Biden Cover-Up)\n\nSams repeatedly defended Biden’s capabilities to serve and disputed that he had declined. Comer said that Sams was never in any position to adamantly assure that Biden was in perfect health given his limited interactions with his boss.\n\n“Ian Sams frequently spoke publicly and with apparent authority about President Biden’s mental fitness and state of mind. However, Mr. Sams admitted he had very limited interaction with the President—identifying only two in-person meetings, one virtual meeting, and one phone call. In fact, Special Counsel Robert Hur probably spent more time with President Biden than Mr. Sams did,” Comer said in a statement.\n\n“Rather than drawing conclusions from firsthand experience, Mr. Sams received much of his direction from the White House Counsel and Biden’s inner circle,” the statement continued. “Mr. Sams repeatedly made broad public claims about the President’s cognitive condition, but he was not in a position to make these claims based on such limited contact.”\n\nSams asserted during a Feb. 9, 2024, press briefing that special counsel Robert Hur’s claims about Biden having a “poor memory” were inaccurate. After interviewing Biden, Hur had concluded that the then-president was a “well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory” and therefore would not prosecute him over the classified documents found in his personal possession.\n\nIn a June 27 letter, Comer wrote to Sams that he should answer to Congress since he had been on “the first line of defense to spin negative stories” about Biden.\n\n“You were on the first line of defense to spin negative stories about the President and his mishaps,” Comer wrote. “The scope of your responsibilities—both official and otherwise—and personal interactions within the Oval Office cannot go without investigation, given the mounting evidence that President Biden was incapacitated for much, if not all, of his single term.”\n\nWhen former Vice President Kamala Harris launched her campaign, Sams publicly challenged President Donald Trump to release his own medical records to prove that he is in good health.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

Briscoe Cain, R-Deer Park, filed paperwork to run for the newly drawn 9th Congressional District on Thursday, kicking off an expected scramble among Republicans for several new seats that the Texas Legislature is on the verge of revamping to favor the GOP.\n\nThe 9th Congressional District, soon to be anchored east of Houston, is one of five Democratic districts that are being significantly redrawn with the goal of electing Republicans. Cain, who filed a statement of candidacy with the Federal Election Commission less than 24 hours after voting to approve the new map in the Texas House Wednesday, is the first major Republican to throw his hat in the ring for the district.\n\nCurrently occupied by longtime Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, the 9th District was moved from southern Houston and its suburbs to east Harris County and heavily Republican Liberty County. What was once a district that voted for Democrat Kamala Harris by a 44-point margin is now, under the new boundary, a district that went for Republican Donald Trump by 20 percentage points.\n\nGreen has said he plans to be on a ballot next year, but has not indicated where he will run. The newly drawn 18th Congressional District, a majority-Black seat anchored in downtown Houston and southern Harris County — and which currently lacks an incumbent — overlaps with his current district lines.\n\nThe 9th District boundaries were shifted further in a revised map that Texas House Republicans submitted and passed this week. The district picked up deep-red Liberty County and was shored up slightly, increasing Trump’s 2024 margin from 15 to 20 points.\n\nCain’s state House district, which includes Deer Park, La Porte and Crosby in eastern Harris County, overlaps with the new congressional district. An attorney and one of the most conservative members of the Texas House, Cain has represented House District 128 since 2017.\n\nHe first claimed office by primarying seven-term state Rep. Wayne Smith in 2016, forcing a runoff and ultimately beating Smith by 23 votes. Since then, Cain has not faced a close election, defeating primary opponents handily in 2020 and 2024.\n\nThrough his five terms in the House, Cain has helped shape legislation to ban abortion and implement voting restrictions. He gained notoriety in 2019 for a viral, controversial tweet at then-presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke saying, “My AR is ready for you” in response to O’Rourke advocating for a mandatory buyback program for assault-style weapons.\n\nNumerous Texans have successfully made the jump from the state house to Congress in recent years, including Fort Worth Republican Rep. Craig Goldman and Farmers Branch Democratic Rep. Julie Johnson in 2024.\n\nMore all-star speakers confirmed for The Texas Tribune Festival, Nov. 13–15! This year’s lineup just got even more exciting with the addition of State Rep. Caroline Fairly, R-Amarillo; former United States Attorney General Eric Holder; Abby Phillip, anchor of “CNN NewsNight”; Aaron Reitz, 2026 Republican candidate for Texas Attorney General; and State Rep.

Katie Porter in California’s 2026 gubernatorial race after Harris declined to run, according to a Politico-Citrin Center-Possibility Lab poll released Thursday.\n\nThe poll found that 30% of registered voters who said they would vote for Harris if she made a bid for California’s governorship now intend to back Porter instead. Meanwhile, 16% of Harris supporters said they will support former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, while 11% said they favored former Biden-era Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra.\n\nThe survey comes after Harris, who was rumored to be a potential contender in the race to succeed term-limited incumbent Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom, announced in July that she was passing on a run.\n\nPorter’s “gains from Harris are probably a combination of just being better known and having a clear ideological stamp,” Jack Citrin, a political science professor at UC Berkeley and partner on the poll, told Politico. “She has a particular progressive stamp — more than the other two guys — and I think that’s part of her appeal.” (RELATED: California Dems Prefer Gavin Newsom Over Kamala Harris For 2028: POLL)\n\nPorter is leading in a head-to-head matchup against the other candidates in the Golden State’s upcoming gubernatorial race, gaining 21% support, according to the poll. The survey found that Becerra and Villaraigosa tied as the next leading Democrats, notching 9% support each. \n\nPorter, who served in Congress from 2019 to 2025, ran in California’s 2024 Senate race, but came in a distant third in the all-party primary, receiving only 15% of the vote despite raising $28 million.

For the first time in more than 10 years, songs based on faith have been dominating the charts. This aligns with society's shift towards more \"traditional values.\"\n\nPop culture and music have long been a bellwether of the political climate. Summer 2024 was \"defined by the ascendance of boundary-pushing female pop stars like Sabrina Carpenter, Chappell Roan and Charli XCX, whose 'brat summer' trend was embraced by Kamala Harris' presidential campaign,\" said Semafor. However, \"rising in a parallel fashion to pop women,\" country music resonated with \"young white people, some who might not even describe themselves as conservative but may have been searching for a watered-down, digestible form of populism,\" said Rolling Stone.\nFor some listeners, country music has served as an \"art form to latch on to when progressive artists (and their politics) alienated them a little too much,\" said Rolling Stone. Much of this was attributed to President Donald Trump's campaign, which was \"based in part on nostalgia for a formerly 'great' time period in U.S. history when white identity was unthreatened and women held traditional roles.\" Since Trump's victory, Christian and Christian-adjacent music, especially by men, has broken its way into mainstream culture, capturing the zeitgeist of this political era. \"In a time of increased polarization around religion, Christian-coded music has finally broken containment and conquered the airwaves,\" said Vox.\n\nSubscribe to The Week\n\nEscape your echo chamber.

This summer has been dominated by \"tradpop,\" a term \"used to describe a hybrid of traditional pop infused with spiritual and country music elements,\" said Artistrack. Songs under this umbrella \"often include lyrics centered around family, faith, personal values and resilience.\" Some examples include Benson Boone's \"Beautiful Things\" and Alex Warren's \"Ordinary,\" which is \"a love song that easily doubles as a Christian worship song\" and has become one of the biggest hits of 2025, said Vox. Christian artists like Jelly Roll and Brandon Lake have also been featured on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\n\"It used to be that Christian music felt like a lesser version of whatever was popular,\" said Holly Zabka, the president of Provident, a Sony subsidiary dedicated to Christian music, to NPR. In the music scene today, Christian artists \"can now simply exist on the same level as all the other artists in the world.\"\nThe meaning\nTradpop has found an audience in young men. \"What unites all of these songs across a broad sonic range is their confessional stance, as well as the performance of raw vulnerability from each male artist,\" said Vox. This is a \"trait that modern men, especially ones steeped in a culture of conservatism, often have difficulty accessing.\" This aligns with phenomena such as the male loneliness epidemic, as well as the growing ideological divide between men and women in the U.S. and globally. \"So many of them struggle with depression, and what they are finding in Christian music is another way to deal with things,\" said Zabka. However, it is \"perhaps ironic that the regressive male codes of stoic masculinity that leave these male artists seeking outlets of expression are frequently heavily reinforced by the same Christian culture they're trying to find themselves within,\" said Vox.\nThe shift to tradpop \"reflects the broader cultural and political narrative shift toward traditional and conservative ideals\" ever since Trump \"returned to power,\" said Semafor. The genre also \"lends itself to the participatory nature of today's social media-led marketing,\" said NPR. \"The musicians currently achieving the greatest success position themselves as co-creators with their audience, much like a pastor communing with their congregation.\"\n\nSign up for Today's Best Articles in your inbox\nA free daily email with the biggest news stories of the day – and the best features from TheWeek.com\nContact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\n\nDevika Rao, The Week US\n\nSocial Links Navigation\n\n Devika Rao has worked as a staff writer at The Week since 2022, covering science, the environment, climate and business.

Frank Pallone Jr. and Rep. Jamie Raskin, Judiciary’s top Democrat, called on Paramount leadership to provide documents and correspondence related to the deal and its approval process with the Trump administration.\n\nThe merger, which was approved late last month by the FCC and officially closed on August 7, came after a politically strained and fraught process that included the previous Paramount leadership paying Trump to settle a lawsuit over a 60 Minutes interview that CBS News’ own lawyers said was “without merit.”\n\nAdditionally, after the settlement was announced, the president claimed that he had reached a “side deal” with Ellison to air up to $20 million worth of pro-Trump advertisements and programming on CBS once Skydance took over the company. While the previous Paramount leadership denied any knowledge of any secret agreement, Ellison has remained mum about the matter.\n\nDays before the merger was approved by Trump’s handpicked Federal Communications Commission chief Brendan Carr, Skydance agreed to install an ombudsman for two years to conduct a “comprehensive review” of CBS News and review “complaints of bias.” The company also agreed to eliminate all diversity hiring practices.\n\nOn top of that, Paramount announced just before the administration approved the merger that it was canceling the long-running late show hosted by outspoken Trump critic Stephen Colbert, even though it was the top-rated program in late-night. Trump and Carr immediately celebrated the news of Colbert’s cancellation. Paramount, meanwhile, has insisted the move was purely for financial reasons, while company sources claimed the show lost $40 million a year.\n\n“In the days and weeks leading up to government approval of the deal, Paramount also agreed to pay $16 million to settle President Trump’s meritless lawsuit related to benign edits of an episode of ‘60 Minutes’—a standard editorial practice—which the FCC also investigated without any legitimate regulatory basis,” the letter to Ellison read. “The settlement raises significant concerns that Donald Trump demanded and Paramount paid an illegal bribe—a $16 million payment to the President in exchange for merger approval from the FCC.”\n\nCarr spent months during the approval process slamming CBS News’ coverage of Trump, accusing it of anti-conservative bias while also reviewing complaints over alleged “news distortion” at the network, specifically over the 60 Minutes interview with Kamala Harris.\n\nRaskin and Pallone aren’t the only ones who have accused Paramount of bribing the president to push through the merger process. While the company – then led by chief shareholder Shari Redstone – was in mediation over the lawsuit, several Democratic senators warned the company that any settlement with Trump could be seen as a violation of anti-bribery statutes. \n\n“Paramount also canceled the highly popular ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,’ which President Trump openly dislikes, shortly after Mr. Colbert’s on-air criticism of Paramount’s settlement as a ‘big fat bribe,’” Raskin and Pallone stated. “As a condition of the merger, Skydance also agreed to make changes to CBS and its editorial practices that align with the Trump Administration’s political agenda, including a commitment to eliminate ‘perceived bias’ in its reporting, the hiring of an ombudsman to police the news organization’s editorial choices, and the dismantling of any initiatives aimed at promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion.”\n\nThe congressmen also raised questions about the influence the new Paramount chief’s father had on the process. Larry Ellison, the founder of Oracle, is a close ally of the president’s and has invested heavily in his son’s venture.\n\n“And within days of your June 7 meeting, President Trump endorsed your bid to purchase Paramount,” the lawmakers wrote Ellison. “Moreover, your father, Larry Ellison, who contributed up to $6 billion toward your purchase of Paramount, reportedly met privately with President Trump multiple times in recent months. Notably, none of these meetings were memorialized with filings in the FCC’s docket on this transaction, prompting objections from other parties in the record.”\n\nReferencing the supposed “side deal” with the president, the congressmen brought up Trump’s public boast that he anticipated that the “new Owners” would give him $20 million of PSAs and similar programming.\n\n“This offer was necessarily contingent on the FCC approving the deal and does not appear to present any legitimate value to the public, only to President Trump,” Pallone and Raskin stated. “Therefore, this appears to be an offer of payment and benefits to a government official designed to achieve a specific outcome from the government — in other words, a bribe.”\n\nAlso noting that several CBS newsroom leaders parted ways with the network over Paramount’s settlement negotiations with Trump, the two Democrats said that the combination of all of these actions could “run afoul of federal and state anti-bribery statutes” while demanding detailed answers surrounding the merger approval process.\n\n“Two wrongs do not make a right—illegitimate demands from the FCC or the Administration do not absolve your company from wrongdoing,” the lawmakers wrote to David Ellison. “If Skydance offered a side deal of up to $20 million worth of advertisement or programming to President Trump in order to receive regulatory approval for the merger with Paramount, these actions would run afoul of federal and state anti-bribery statutes.”\n\nThey continued: “Similarly, if Paramount forced out CBS’s longtime leaders, spent $16 million to settle a sham lawsuit with President Trump, or cancelled a highly popular comedy show that President Trump dislikes in order to curry favor with the Administration and to receive regulatory approval for the merger with Skydance, these actions would likely further embolden President Trump to use lawsuits and regulatory authority to attack media organizations that he finds objectionable in order to silence them.” \n\nRepresentatives for Paramount and Ellison declined to comment.","summary":"‘Two wrongs do not make a right—illegitimate demands from the FCC or the

one post on X read.\n\nAnother said, 'Taylor doing it right and the boys just doing random stuff...' \n\n'She said \"lemme show yall a real vocal warm up\",' another Swiftie posted.\n\nOne comment read, 'I love how Taylor is actually warming up, Jason is repeating brown cow, and Travis is just yelling things [laughing emoji].'\n\nTeasers leading up to the episode revealed that Swift would be unveiling the cover and release date for her highly-anticipated 12th album, 'The Life of a Showgirl'.\n\nSwifties flocked in droves to listen to the episode live - breaking the record for the most-watched live-streamed podcast in YouTube's history at 1.3million viewers.\n\nIt shattered the previous mark - held by 'The Joe Rogan Experience' when the eponymous host brought on then-Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.\n\nThe stream was so popular that Swifties ended up crashing the YouTube stream at the 1 hour, 44 minute mark.\n\nSwift's appearance on the episode set the record for most-watched podcast livestream \n\nThe episode surpassed a mark previously set when Donald Trump went on Joe Rogan's show\n\n'Shoutout all the 92%ers and Swifties for actually helping us break the internet,' the New Heights X account said after the stream had concluded.\n\nJason Kelce, the former Philadelphia Eagles center and co-host, referenced Swift's love of the number 13 by tweeting, '1.3million views is the epitome of numerology.' \n\nNot only that, but the New Heights YouTube channel saw a spike in subscriber numbers.\n\nThe channel began at 2.85million subs before the episode began. By the next morning, the subscriber count sat at 2.97million. Currently, the channel has 3.06million subs.\n\nWhile it did break the live-viewership record, it did not catch up to the 24-hour viewer count that the Trump episode of Rogan had.\n\nIn the first 24-hours of that episode, Rogan's channel had 26million views. A little over seven days after the 'New Heights' episode aired, it sits at 20.2million views.\n\nBut breaking one record held by Trump is sure to be a feather in Swift's cap after she endorsed Democrat nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump has gone on the offensive against Swift in the past, calling her 'no longer hot' after the endorsement of Harris and mocking her for being booed at Super Bowl LIX.\n\nWhile Taylor and Travis have that record, it's still a ways off the 26million views that then-candidate Trump got when going on 'The Joe Rogan Experience' last year\n\nTaylor Swift reveals how Travis Kelce's shock Eras Tour appearance really came to be\n\nNot only does this two-hour conversation mark a major moment for the show, it also is a perfect full-circle moment for Travis and Taylor.\n\nTravis previously mentioned in July 2023 how he'd like to have Swift on the show and how he tried giving her a friendship bracelet at a concert in Kansas City, but that he wasn't able to meet her.\n\nCut to now.

While she didn’t want to comment on that specific case, she told the audience at the Edinburgh TV Festival, where she received the group’s first Edinburgh Fellowship award, that she thinks there is something turning in Hollywood, The Wrap reported.\n\n“It definitely feels that way to a lot of people, that there is self-censoring going on,” Rhimes claimed.\n\nIndeed, there have been decades of forcing Hollywood conservatives to hide their political leanings and years of witch hunts against those in the industry who have broken the tenets of wokism. Rhimes’ concerns of supposed “censorship” in Hollywood now may be viewed by some as ironic.\n\nRhimes also spoke about her resignation from the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. The Scandal producer left the organization in February after the president had taken over the operation of the theater and replaced several other members of the board.\n\nRhimes had been serving as the organization’s treasurer, but stayed on for a little longer than some of the other members she had served with.\n\n“But once that transition was made, I literally was the only person left who was an artist, who was of the old regime of the Kennedy Center,” she said at the festival. “Therefore, in my mind, it wasn’t a board anymore. It’s certainly not the board with the same mission as when I came in.”\n\nRhimes was a big supporter of Joe Biden and then Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nShe has also used her television shows to make heavy pushes in support of abortion.

Meanwhile, the race is also a test for Republicans to see if Ciattarelli can build off of Trump's coalition in New Jersey.The poll provides an independent look at the race as November inches nearer.What to KnowThe Rutgers Eagleton Institute of Politics poll found that Sherrill continues to hold a lead, but that Ciattarelli has grown his support since its last survey in early July.Forty-four percent of respondents intend to cast their ballots for Sherrill, while 35 percent are planning to support Ciattarelli. An additional 17 percent are still unsure of who they'll be voting for in November, according to the poll.Ashley Koning, director of the poll, wrote in a memo that Sherrill \"still has the edge\" but noted that the race \"is competitive and will continue to be in flux\" due to the high number of undecided voters.The poll surveyed 1,650 likely voters from July 31 to August 11, 2025, and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.An earlier Eagleton poll, released July 2, showed Sherrill with a double-digit lead—with 51 percent of respondents saying they would vote for her, compared to 31 percent who said they would vote for Ciattarelli. Koning noted at the time that \"a lot can happen between now and November.\"In 2021, Ciattarelli narrowly lost to Democratic Governor Phil Murphy, who is not running again due to term limits.Ciattarelli has been endorsed by President Donald Trump, who looms over the race. Sherrill, who represents a suburban North Jersey district in Congress, has cast herself as a more moderate candidate.New Jersey only voted for former Vice President Kamala Harris by about six points last year—Democrats' smallest margin in years. About 46 percent of Garden State voters cast their ballots for Trump, compared to 52 percent who supported Harris.For contest, former President Joe Biden carried New Jersey by 16 points in 2020, while former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton carried it by 14 points in 2016.Other polls have similarly found Sherrill with a single-digit lead. A Farleigh Dickinson poll of 806 registered voters from July 17 to July 23 showed Sherrill leading by eight points (45 percent to 37 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.A Cygnal poll, which surveyed 500 likely voters from June 19 to June 20, showed Sherrill up seven points (50 percent to 43 percent). It had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.36 percentage points, reported The New York Post.What People Are SayingKoning wrote in the polling memo: \"We are also at a turning point in New Jersey politics. Likely voters are always an unknown population, but especially given today's political climate, shifting turnout dynamics in the state, and the race's history-making potential, we simply do not know who will definitively turn out come Election Day. The only thing for certain is that all eyes are on New Jersey this cycle.\"Kyle Kondik of Sabato's Crystal Ball, in a June 11 report: \"The main reasons to favor Sherrill are that she has been a good electoral performer in the House—although she was not strongly pushed in her four general election races—and that she is a Democrat running in what is still a Democratic-leaning state in what should be at least a modestly Democratic-leaning environment with Donald Trump in the White House. That said, she is also running for a third straight Democratic gubernatorial term, so Ciattarelli can make an argument for change at the state level.\"What Happens NextThe New Jersey gubernatorial election is scheduled for November 4, 2025. The Cook Political Report classifies the race as Lean Democrat, meaning it is \"considered competitive,\" but Sherrill has \"an advantage.\"","summary":"A new poll found that Sherrill's lead in the New Jersey governor race has narrowed since July.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jack-ciattarelli-single-digits-mikie-sherrill-poll-2117072","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2706969/jack-ciattarelli-new-jersey-governor-poll.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88&f=d1a2eee9984d936195708569e2c12e55","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 15:12:28","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.286},{"id":352963586,"title":"Kamala Harris Announces International Book Tour for New Memoir “107 Days”","text":"Kamala Harris is heading out on tour.\nThe former Vice President will go on a 15-city book tour across the U.S., Canada and England for her new memoir, 107 Days, according to a press release shared with PEOPLE.107 Days recounts the \"intense, high-stakes and deeply personal” period of Harris’ 2024 Democratic presidential campaign, following President Joe Biden withdrawing from his reelection campaign.\n\n \"Since leaving office, I’ve spent a lot of time reflecting on those days and with candor and reflection, I’ve written a behind-the-scenes account of that journey,\" Harris said in her initial July 31 video announcement. \"I believe there’s value in sharing what I saw, what I learned and what it will take to move forward.”\n\n The book tour will see Harris going to multiple cities across the United States, as well as stops in Ontario and London.

He ignored every single question when pressed by a Fox News reporter on the alleged “effort to shield President Biden” or on the report released by Special Counsel Robert Hur in February 2024, which concluded that Biden was a “well-meaning elderly man with a poor memory.”\n\n“Chairman [James] Comer said there was an effort to shield President Biden, do you think that’s accurate?” the reporter asked, but Sams remained silent. “He also is going to ask you about the Hur report, do you think the Hur report was accurate?” (RELATED: ‘Are You Disloyal?’: Former White House Adviser Refuses To Answer Reporter’s Simple Questions On Biden’s Cover-Up)\n\nSams played a pivotal role in the previous administration as a senior adviser for the White House Counsel’s Office and as a special assistant to Biden. He did not speak to reporters about his upcoming testimony despite spending years as a public spokesperson for both Biden and former Vice President Kamala Harris when she launched her 2024 campaign.\n\nOversight Committee Chairman James Comer sought out the testimonies of Sams, former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and several other former officials on June 27 to provide “answers” on the cover-up.

The tour will kick off September 24, one day after the release of her memoir “107 Days,” and will end at Miami’s Ziff Opera House in late November. Harris announced the tour in a short social media video that listed the stops over clips from her unsuccessful 2024 presidential campaign. Harris last month described the book as “a journal” that will recount that abbreviated run that was launched after then-President Joe Biden abruptly dropped out of the race. “During these special events, Harris will share what she saw, what she learned, and what it will take to move forward,” book publisher Simon & Schuster wrote in a press release. Most of the conversations are slated to take place in theaters and music halls. Organizers have not announced moderators for the events. Several small and independently owned bookstores will be partnering with Harris in cities along the tour, which was an intentional move by the vice president, according to a source familiar with her plans. That source told NBC News that Harris expanded the tour to include more “untraditional” markets like Portland, Oregon, and Durham, North Carolina, and that it’s possible she makes additional surprise visits around formal book events. While some events are scheduled in reliably conservative states, including Texas, Tennessee and Alabama, the tour will likely fuel even more speculation around Harris’ political future. In July, the former vice president announced she would not enter the 2026 race for California governor. “I don’t want to go back in the system,” she explained in an interview on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.” “I want to travel the country,” Harris told the late-night host, adding “I want to listen to people, I want to talk with people, and I don’t want it to be transactional, where I’m asking for their vote.” Two sources close to Harris told NBC News last month that she was looking to keep an option open to run for president again in 2028. The book publisher says tickets are scheduled to go on sale Friday, with “VIP Meet & Greet” tickets available that include a photo with Harris and a signed copy of the book.","summary":"Former Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday announced a 15-city book tour that will take her from New York and San Francisco to Toronto and London","url":"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/kamala-harris/kamala-harris-announces-international-book-tour-107-days-rcna226190","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-1500w,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2024-09/240906-kamala-harris-ac-534p-6669d1.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 14:00:55","author":"Shaquille Brewster","authors":["Shaquille Brewster"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.086},{"id":352943948,"title":"Former Biden aide Ian Sams arrives for House Oversight autopen interview","text":"In a June letter requesting his testimony, Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-KY) wrote that Sams had been “a first line of defense to spin negative stories about the President and his mishaps” and possessed critical knowledge of “who made key decisions and exercised the powers of the executive branch … possibly without former President Biden’s consent.”\n\n“We’re going to ask him a lot of questions about what he would say publicly behind the podium at the White House, what he would tweet about, and see if he still stands by a lot of those claims made,” Comer said before Sams arrived Thursday.\n\nAt the center of the inquiry are questions about the autopen, a mechanical device that replicates a president’s signature. While past presidents have used it for routine correspondence, Republicans allege Biden’s aides may have deployed it on weighty executive actions and mass pardons without his personal consent — a move they warn could amount to a constitutional breach.\n\nThe testimony comes on the heels of revelations reported earlier this week that Biden ignored warnings by a senior Justice Department official about the public characterization of his mass clemency grants during his final days in office. Internal DOJ emails, obtained by the conservative Oversight Project and reviewed by the Washington Examiner, showed former Associate Deputy Attorney Bradley Weinsheimer warned the White House that the vague language in Biden’s mass commutations risked freeing violent felons — contradicting public claims that only “nonviolent drug offenders” were implicated as part of the over 2,500 candidates covered in the clemency sweep.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill have seized on the post-presidency revelations of Biden’s reliance on the autopen. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) in June demanded records showing Biden personally authorized each use of the autopen, warning that “we should subpoena those documents, and we should find out the truth of who was really running the White House.”\n\nDuring the 2024 campaign, Sams drew attention in his role as a spokesman for then-Vice President Kamala Harris when then-candidate Donald Trump singled him out by name.\n\n“Sams is just a below-average guy, with memorized FAKE NEWS soundbites, almost all of which are WRONG,” Trump wrote on Truth Social after one of Sams’s appearances on Fox News last year.\n\nTrump has described Biden’s utilization of the autopen as possibly “one of the biggest scandals that we’ve had in 50-100 years,” comparing it to Watergate and beyond. Still, experts say the act of using the autopen is legally sound, while Republicans have deepened their desires to uncover whether Biden always assented to his aides utilizing it, pointing to reports like a July New York Times article that revealed the former president signed off on a method of “criteria” for mass clemency rather than directly reviewing the convicted people.\n\nBiden, in a phone interview with the New York Times, pushed back on those allegations, calling Trump and his allies “liars” and insisting, “I made every decision.” Though he defended the use of the autopen due to the volume of warrants, he confirmed he hand-signed only one: a December 2024 pardon for his son Hunter Biden.\n\nSams is well known in Washington for his role defending Biden after special counsel Robert Hur’s report, which described the president as an “elderly man with a poor memory.” He also ran the January 2023 press call regarding the discovery of classified documents at Biden’s Delaware home, which prompted Hur’s investigation.\n\nSams’s interview is expected to last several hours. He is the eighth out of 11 scheduled interviews with high-level aides, including Anita Dunn and Ron Klain, who have appeared before committee investigators in recent weeks.\n\nComer hinted that more of Biden’s inner circle could be called to testify in the near future, saying, “I think there are a few more people that should want to set the record straight. We’ll talk about that at a later date.”","summary":"Ian Sams, who was a&#160;White House spokesman and senior communications aide&#160;to&#160;former President Joe Biden, arrived Thursday morning on Capitol Hill for a closed-door, voluntary interview with the&#160;House Oversight Committee&#160;as part of its investigation into the Biden administration’s use of the autopen.

Hillary Clinton versus former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Clinton was being groomed for this the moment she won reelection in New York, while Giuliani was named the Time Person of the Year in 2001 and called “a tower of strength” on the same cover. \n\nAmong registered GOP voters in September 2007, Giuliani led easily with 32% support in a Pew Research poll conducted at the time, followed by the senator and former actor Fred Thompson at 16%. Thompson’s name was also bandied about as a strong contender, with some seeing him as the next coming of another Hollywood star-turned-president in the mold of Reagan. \n\nAs it turns out, Giuliani flamed out quickly. Thompson also failed to gain traction and never could catch that Reagan magic, leaving John McCain battling Mitt Romney for the nomination, with McCain coming out on top. \n\nOn the Democratic side, Clinton was leading a relatively unknown Barack Obama by 17 points in the same Pew poll in September 2007, 42%-25%. “Hillary the Inevitable!” was the headline from Politico at the time, with poll after poll showing her ahead. \n\nBut the more Obama spoke, the more the 40-something newcomer was seen, the more voters liked him. He had the energy, he connected especially with younger voters, and the guy really knew how to nail a speech. Clinton, in contrast, appeared annoyed that her coronation had become a competition. \n\nTo quote Apollo Creed’s trainer in the original Rocky, after Creed was getting much more than he could handle in the early rounds, “He doesn’t know it’s a damn show. He thinks it’s a damn fight!” \n\nObama, of course, would go on to capture the nomination and the presidency by easily defeating McCain. \n\nSo that’s just one lesson in not trying to predict nominees and horse races too soon. The other most obvious example is the 2016 race, with then-candidate Donald Trump’s campaign.\n\n“This is not a real political candidate, not a real political figure, this is a sideshow,” declared the Atlantic’s McKay Coppins on CNN’s Reliable Sources in 2014.\n\nTrump would go on to win the presidency after bulldozing 16 GOP candidates in the primary before shocking Clinton in the general, while Reliable Sources would go on to be canceled. \n\n“I came to Manchester [NH] for the purpose of pressing him on why he is so intent on continuing this charade,” Coppins wrote before his CNN appearance, which likely led to him being booked for the sole purpose of dunking on Trump. “But what I found was a man startled by his suddenly fading relevance — and consumed by a desperate need to get it back.” \n\nThat aged well, didn’t it? \n\nBottom line: It’s usually a fool’s errand to make these kinds of political predictions early. But in the case of 2028, it’s hard to envision any scenario that doesn’t have Vice President JD Vance at the top of the ticket and Secretary of State Marco Rubio as his No. 2. \n\nFor Rubio, it’s been a case study in growing confidence since he first ran for president 10 years ago. Rubio, after finishing a strong third in 2016 in Iowa, where he nearly topped second-place Trump (Ted Cruz won), was seen as a possible nominee at just age 44. But his nervous, rehearsed debate performance in the primaries showed he wasn’t ready for the big stage yet. \n\nPolitico, February 2016: “Rubio awkwardly pivoted four times to a well-rehearsed line that President Barack Obama ‘knows exactly what he’s doing’ as he tried to drill home the idea that he’s the inevitable general election candidate — an unforced error that his rivals pounced on and that quickly went viral.”\n\nThen-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who was seemingly in the race solely to take out Rubio, mocked him for being too scripted. \n\n“There it is. There it is. The memorized 25-second speech. There it is, everybody!” Christie charged.\n\n“I think the case for Marco being ready to be commander in chief took a hit tonight,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) said at the time. \n\nRubio would drop out not long after. \n\nSince then, however, Rubio is no longer dependent on canned lines and talking points. As secretary of state in the Trump administration, he is often sent to hostile media territory to carry the administration’s message on foreign policy. \n\nExhibit A was last Sunday when Rubio appeared on the hopelessly biased Face the Nation, anchored by Margaret Brennan on CBS. \n\n“You know there is concern from the Europeans that President Zelensky is going to be bullied into signing something away. That’s why you have these European leaders coming as backup tomorrow,” Brennan asserted to Rubio without offering evidence to support such a claim. \n\n“That is not true,” Rubio protested. “But that’s not true, they’re not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelensky from being bullied.”\n\n“We had one meeting with Putin and like a dozen meetings with Zelensky. … They’re not coming here tomorrow to keep Zelensky from being bullied. They are coming here because we’ve been working with the Europeans. We talked to them last week. … The president talked to these leaders as early as Thursday. … This is such a stupid media narrative,” a flabbergasted Rubio added. \n\nAnd that’s how you do it: Don’t accept an anchor like Brennan’s opinion but challenge said anchor with facts. \n\nVance famously did the same to Brennan and CBS’s Norah O’Donnell during the 2024 election in the first and only vice presidential debate against goofy Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN). At one point in the 90-minute showdown, Vance broached Springfield, Ohio, and the influx of Haitian immigrants there who were not legal citizens of the United States.\n\n“Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you’ve got schools that are overwhelmed, you’ve got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you have got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes. The people that I’m most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris’s open border,” Vance explained. \n\n“To clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status. Temporary protected status,” Brennan shot back as if she were debating Vance. \n\n“Well, Margaret, I think it’s important because,” Vance tried to respond before being cut off. \n\nBrennan (piously): “Thank you, Senator. We have so much to get to.”\n\nVance: “Margaret. The rules were that you guys weren’t going to fact-check, and since you’re fact-checking me, I think it’s important to say what’s actually going on. So there’s an application called the CBP One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum, or apply for parole, and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in, applying for a green card, and waiting for 10 years.\n\nBrennan: “Thank you, Senator.”\n\nVance: “That is the facilitation of illegal immigration, Margaret, by our own leadership. And Kamala Harris opened up that pathway.”\n\nBrennan (even more piously): “Thank you, Senator, for describing the legal process. We have so much to get to.”\n\nVance’s fact check of the fact check was absolutely correct. But as he tried to finish, Brennan jumped in again. \n\nBrennan (with oozing disdain and sarcasm): “Gentlemen, the audience can’t hear you because your mics are cut. We have so much we want to get to. Thank you for explaining the legal process. Norah?”\n\nYep. Vance was winning the argument, and Brennan had been thoroughly embarrassed, so they cut his audio. \n\nThe Republican would go on to win the debate easily, according to every postdebate poll. By doing so and by taking on the moderators, Vance was fully embraced by MAGA, which isn’t exactly an easy task (just ask Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL)). \n\nAnd that’s the thing: It’s hard to see how anyone outside of Trump’s current inner circle is getting the nod from the MAGA base, which is the most dominant base of any political party by a country mile. \n\nNikki Haley? DeSantis? Ted Cruz? Rand Paul? Tim Scott? Glenn Youngkin? Solid candidates with solid resumes, for sure, but without Trump’s endorsement, and that surely will eventually go to his vice president, the nomination will be impossible to capture. \n\nVance-Rubio 2028. \n\nThat’s one tough ticket consisting of two men who know how to handle the media and rarely make unforced errors. \n\nIt may be early, but what better option can anyone think of right now?","summary":"This week, I traveled to Simi Valley, California, for a speaking event at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, and we got to the interactive Q&#38;A portion of the evening.

Evans and other Harriet’s Wildest Dreams volunteers were at the station on “cop watch” to ensure the federal takeover would not lead to harassment of Black youth. Yet, it happened to three Black youths anyway, prompting Evans to intervene, which led to her arrest.\n\nAfter public protests in DC and on social media, she was released to cheering crowds outside the court, and the charges against her were dropped the next day.\n\nLike with so many other issues related to Trump and his attempts at autocracy, his use of the National Guard and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to stifle community ecosystems especially impacts Washington’s Black, Brown and Queer residents. This effort to squash potential dissent is more than a distraction from the Epstein files controversy or America’s economic troubles.\n\nLocally, it is a partial end to the District of Columbia’s half-century of home rule, which otherwise makes the city independent of direct federal oversight. Nationally, it is an open question about whether DC can remain a site of protest, a place where marches and other gatherings can effect change or even occur at all in the current autocratic climate.\n\nTrump’s executive order announcing his takeover of DC’s police force on August 11 should not have come as a surprise, especially given his attempts to bring the federal government’s power to bear in California back in June. “Crime is out of control in the District of Columbia”, the order reads, stating that the “increase in violent crime in the heart of our Republic… poses intolerable risks to the vital federal functions that take place in the District of Columbia”.\n\nBut the truth is, Trump’s executive order manufactured a crisis out of far-right fantasies. Six days before Trump’s announcement, two teenagers carjacked Edward Coristine, a 19-year-old former staffer at the Department of Government Efficiency, in DC’s Logan Circle. “We’re going to do something about it. That includes bringing in the National Guard,” Trump said in the aftermath of the incident.\n\nHowever, the two alleged carjackers in police custody were from Hyattsville, Maryland, in Prince George’s County, and not DC.\n\nTrump’s moves also fly in the face of another truth: Crime is no bigger an issue in DC than it is anywhere else in the United States. At the beginning of the year, a joint report from the US Attorney’s Office in DC and the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) showed that the city’s violent crime rate had dropped by 35 percent in 2024, reaching its lowest rate since the mid-1990s. “Armed carjackings are down 53%,” according to the report.\n\nWashington, DC, is a great stage for beta-testing how willing the rest of the US is to go to achieve Trump’s dream of autocratic rule. DC remains a majority-minority city, with Black Washingtonians making up a plurality (43 percent) of the population, despite 30 years of middle-class (mostly white) gentrification – white Washingtonians make up 39 percent of DC’s population.\n\nSo, it is not that surprising Trump would attempt such heavy-handed tactics in a soft occupation of DC, particularly in a city that was once famously nicknamed “Chocolate City”. In a capital where more than 90 percent of voters chose former Vice President Kamala Harris over Trump in the 2024 presidential election, Trump is also sending the unvarnished and racist message that Black folk, and especially Black youth, are criminals.\n\nImposing a heightened police presence and hundreds of National Guard soldiers on a multiracial city is nothing but a wannabe strongman’s attempt to appear strong to his anti-Black supporters.\n\nDC is also known as a place that holds significance for Queer Americans. One out of every seven adults in the nation’s capital identifies as LGBTQIA+, roughly 80,000 Washingtonians in all. Northwest DC, particularly communities like Dupont Circle, Logan Circle, Adams Morgan, and parts of Shaw and Columbia Heights, became a relatively safe space in the 1960s and 1970s for Queer culture and businesses to thrive. The inaugural National March for Lesbian and Gay Rights began in DC in 1979.\n\nIt should not shock anyone that an anti-Queer Trump administration would also target DC’s Queer and migrant spaces. The federalised police presence in DC has been especially noticeable along the 14th Street and U Street corridors, including the installation of not-so-random checkpoints over the past couple of weeks. Inevitably – between the National Guard, federal law enforcement and anti-immigrant agencies like Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in conjunction with the MPD – they have made dozens of arrests, and smothered nightlife and business traffic in these communities.\n\nTrump, in his own ham-fisted way, is also attempting to erase DC’s history as one of protest and resistance. As the US evolved into a superpower, and DC transformed into the international community’s superpower city during and after World War II, the city also became a place for protest, particularly for racial justice and civil rights. Examples include the March on Washington on August 28, 1963, as well as a series of antiwar protests against Vietnam between 1965 and 1971. Marches and protests for the Equal Rights Amendment, for a Gay Rights Bill, for Chicano rights, Indigenous rights, and migrant and refugee rights came alongside civil rights marches and protests throughout the 1960s and 1970s. Massive protests like the 2017 Women’s March, the George Floyd protests in 2020 and the Free Palestine protests last year have made DC a target ripe for government overreach.\n\nBut what Trump is doing to DC in 2025 is not quite unprecedented – not for him, and not for the federal government. In 2018, during Trump’s first term as president, the US National Park Service (NPS) sought to shrink the available sidewalk space around the White House for protests “by 80 percent”, and to charge demonstrators permit fees “to allow the NPS to recover some of the costs” of public safety provisions. On June 1, 2020, the National Guard and the US Park Police tear-gassed, lobbed concussion grenades and violently arrested George Floyd protesters at Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House – all so that Trump could do a photo-op nearby on the steps of St John’s Church, calling himself “your president of law and order” along the way.\n\nTrump has followed in the footsteps of another “law and order” president, Richard Nixon. In May 1971, Nixon unleashed the National Guard and local police against thousands of antiwar demonstrators in DC, in what became known as the Mayday protests, leading to more than 12,000 arrests over a three-day period.\n\nIn 1932, President Herbert Hoover authorised the use of military force against a ragtag group of 20,000 unemployed and unhoused World War I veterans known as the Bonus Army. At the height of the Great Depression and looking for the bonus money Congress owed them, the military responded with gas grenades, bayonets, flamethrowers and tanks, destroying their shantytowns along the National Mall and Anacostia River. Two veterans died, while the Army injured thousands of others. The resulting tear gas cloud over the city also led to the death of an infant.\n\nTrump and his small army of occupiers are trying to make an example out of the nation’s capital, to destroy the DC of the past century, its vibrancy and resistance. The irony, of course, is that one of Trump’s first acts in his second term was to pardon more than 1,500 insurrectionists who had been part of the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, a deadly and treasonous event.\n\nNow, Trump wants to cower Washingtonians into accepting autocracy.\n\nDC’s legacy as the national seat of power, as an international city, and as the centre of the so-called Free World, is in peril. But its most vulnerable and marginalised residents continue to resist, despite the dangers of Trump as a despot.","summary":"By federalising the capital’s police and stifling protests, Trump is testing how far he can go to remake the US.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/8/21/trumps-occupation-of-dc-is-a-rehearsal-for-autocracy?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AFP__20250815__69NJ8DL__v1__HighRes__UsPoliticsTrumpWashingtonCrime-1755326041.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-08-21 12:17:17","author":"Apps Support,Donald Earl Collins","authors":["Apps Support","Donald Earl Collins"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"QA","sentiment":-0.187},{"id":352927818,"title":"‘She did it, big time’: Ilona Maher’s road to becoming rugby’s biggest breakout star since Lomu","text":"“And then that same fall, I had a voicemail. I saved it. And she sounds like a little kid. ‘Hello, Coach Carlson, this is Ilona Maher. I just wanted to call and tell you I want to transfer from Norwich to Quinnipiac. I’m a nursing student. I would like for you to call me back.’ \n\n“And I was like: ‘I didn’t have to give my right arm.’” \n\nA decade later, many would give their right arm for time with Ilona Maher. Ahead of a World Cup in England set to take the women’s game to new audiences, the 5ft 10in US center is a global star. Followed by millions on social media, a reality TV contestant and swimsuit model broadcasting a message of body positivity, the kid in the pink scrum cap has become a phenomenon – easily rugby’s biggest breakout star in the 30 years since the All Blacks wing Jonah Lomu stormed the men’s stage.\n\nMaher was born in Burlington, Vermont, in August 1996, a year after Lomu lit up his World Cup in South Africa. Michael and Mieneke Maher had three daughters, all athletic. In high school, in her dad’s words, Ilona became “a multi-sport star: starting pitcher for the softball team, state all-star, state all-star for field hockey, state all-star for basketball.\n\n“But when she got to senior spring, she didn’t like the way the softball program was … in terms of the lack of exercise. She would say: ‘Dad, they kept us for two-and-a-quarter hours, they didn’t ever sweat it once. I’m not going to do it.’” \n\nThe Mahers had a rule: you’ve got to play something. Ilona considered lacrosse or track but there was rugby too. Michael Maher found the game at college and stayed with it, propping for Mad River RFC, a club outside Stowe. While Michael played and refereed, Ilona spent a lot of time on the sidelines.\n\n“There was a rugby programme at the other high school in Burlington that allowed people from different high schools to come to it and was coached by friends of mine,” Michael Maher said. “Ilona decided to try that. Phone calls started right away.” \n\nUS college sports are serious business, coaches competing to recruit the best of the best. Ilona chose Norwich, an hour south of home, once a military school. Her first year brought success on the field but the culture wasn’t a fit. And so she placed that fateful call to Quinnipiac, a small college in Hamden, CT.\n\nQuinnipiac women’s rugby had varsity status, bringing funding and focus. Most importantly to Maher, the program was led by Carlson, a coach widely known for her dedication to success on the field and equality with the men’s game off it. As Maher described it to the Guardian in July, before a US national team game against Fiji in Washington: “Having a force like that behind you, who believes in you, believes that as a program we deserve more funding, as women we deserve more, that has kind of carried over.” \n\nCarlson switched Maher from prop to center, her size and speed propelling the Bobcats to three national titles and herself to the MA Sorensen award for best women’s collegiate player. Maher got her nursing degree, top of the class, alongside an intense rugby schooling. As Carlson described it, for three years, Maher and her teammates “got up at five in the morning to lift. You have breakfast, you have training … two sessions a day. You’re still talking about going through rigorous courses with nursing and all the pre-science they take. You’re doing strength and conditioning, you’re doing agility, you’re going to practice. You’re watching game film. All of it.”\n\nMaher graduated in 2018. There was no professional 15-a-side option for women but sevens had Olympic status. As her father tells it: “She said: ‘You know, Dad, I’m not done. I want to keep going, I think I can make the Eagles Sevens.’ Which to me seemed a little funny, because I think of that as a skinny person’s game. But boy, she just worked at it. She stayed so fit and she did it, big time.” \n\nIn 2018, Maher made her US debut in Paris. Covid intervened in 2020 but at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, Maher made an impact, her play and her social media posts attracting a growing following. In 2024, at the Paris Games, the Eagles took bronze with a thrilling win over Australia, Maher’s muscular contribution celebrated alongside widely shared TikTok videos from the athletes’ village complete with her personal hashtag: #BeastBeautyBrains.\n\nBack home came lift-off: competing on Dancing with the Stars, posing for Sports Illustrated, endorsing Kamala Harris, launching her own line of cosmetics. Wanting to play 15s at the 2025 World Cup, she signed a short‑term contract with Bristol in England where she attracted record Premiership crowds before flying home.\n\nIn July, at an awards ceremony in Los Angeles, ESPN named Maher Best Breakthrough Athlete. From the podium, she told fans: “Strong is beautiful. Strong is powerful. And I hope more girls can feel how I feel … Take up space. Pitch it faster. Run harder. Put another plate on the bar and never tone it down.” \n\nA few days later, in DC, more than 15,000 paid to see Maher and the Eagles face Fiji — the Ilona effect clearly moving from the digital realm to the real world.\n\n“I don’t know if anybody could quantify it,” Bill Goren, USA Rugby CEO, says of her influence. “She has made a massive impact on our community, especially our young women who are engaging in a game they probably never would have otherwise.” \n\nSimilarly, Sally Horrox, director of women’s rugby for World Rugby, saluted how Maher had “come out of the rugby bubble” and entered the American sporting consciousnessto become “the eighth-most marketable sports property globally”.\n\nAmid pomp and circumstance in DC, pressing flesh as cameras flashed, Maher sometimes seemed slightly uneasy, at least with her press. Frustrated by the Eagles’ stuttering play, or her own performance, or just the questions thrown her way, her fierce edge was on display.\n\nFrom afar, Carlson looked on. She has experienced frustrations of her own amid 15 years at the sharp end. When Maher was there with her, she felt similar pressures.\n\n“We would go from these really big peaks to these really deep chasms,” Carlson said. “It was like: ‘Yes, this is something I can do, this is what I want to do, no, I can’t do this.’ I’m sure this is the story of a lot of high-profile athletes that we never see, because social media is what it is – it’s beautiful, everybody was birthed perfect, there were never any hard decisions, never any hard conversations.”\n\nIn reality, she says, Maher’s path to stardom has been “really hard”. Seeking to help her athlete, Carlson “had a long conversation with one of my really good friends, Becky Burleigh, who coached [record-setting USA striker] Abby Wambach at Florida. I would be, like: ‘How did you coach Abby through this?’ Because Abby was very similar to Lo in stature, in the way she played, but also in this other sinking feeling of self doubt that never projected anywhere else. That’s not something that’s usually part of Ilona’s story.” \n\nNor, sometimes, is Maher’s status as just another player. Before the Fiji game, at a gala dinner near the White House, Maher was in demand but stayed close to her fellow Eagles, dressed in uniform track jacket, jeans and sneakers, blending in when all were called onstage. She and sisters Olivia and Adrianna – co-hosts of a podcast, House of Maher – regularly speak of the need to stay grounded. Michael and Meineke Maher are certainly so, radiating positivity.\n\nAt the World Cup, the American women face a stern test. Samoa should be beaten but Pool A also includes Australia and England, overwhelming favorites to lift the trophy.

Ian Sams is a longtime Democrat communications operative who most recently served as a senior spokesman for former Vice President Kamala Harris' 2024 campaign. Before that, he served as a senior advisor and spokesman for the White House Counsel's Office under former President Joe Biden, where his primary role entailed responding to congressional probes mainly launched by Republicans. RON KLAIN DODGES REPORTERS AFTER MARATHON GRILLING IN BIDEN COVER-UP PROBE \"You were a first line of defense to spin negative stories about the president and his mishaps,\" House Oversight Committee Chair James Comer, R-Ky., wrote to Sams in late June. He pointed out that Sams' tenure in that role, which lasted from May 2022 to late August 2024, stretched across much of the latter half of Biden's term. \"The scope of your responsibilities – both official and otherwise – and personal interactions within the Oval Office cannot go without investigation, given the mounting evidence that President Biden was incapacitated for much, if not all, of his single term,\" Comer wrote. \"If White House staff carried out a strategy lasting months or even years to hide the chief executive’s condition – or to perform his duties – Congress may need to consider a legislative response.\" LONGTIME BIDEN AIDE SAYS HE STOOD TO EARN UP TO $8M HAD PRESIDENT WON RE-ELECTION Comer's committee is investigating whether Biden's top White House aides covered up signs of mental decline in the former president from both the media and fellow Democrats. Of particular interest to House investigators is the myriad clemency orders that Trump signed in the latter half of his four-year term, and whether those decisions and others signed via autopen were made with Biden's full awareness. Biden maintained he \"made every decision\" in a recent interview with The New York Times. Sams was also notably thrust into the spotlight during his time as a Harris 2024 spokesman after being called out by name by President Donald Trump. \"Sams is just a below-average guy, with memorized FAKE NEWS soundbites, almost all of which are WRONG,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social after one of Sams' appearances on Fox News Channel last year. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP While Sams is the 11th former Biden White House aide appearing, he is just the eighth to come in for a voluntary interview. Three other former Biden officials – ex-White House physician Kevin O'Connor and former senior advisors Anthony Bernal and Annie Tomasini – were compelled to appeal via subpoena. Like the sit-downs before his, Sams' interview will be taking place behind closed doors and is expected to be led by lawyers for both Republicans and Democrats on the committee.","summary":"Former Biden spokesman Ian Sams is appearing before the House Oversight Committee for a transcribed interview on Thursday.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ex-biden-spin-doctor-ian-sams-slammed-trump-below-average-grilled-house-autopen-probe","image":"https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/08/ian-sams-oversight.jpg","video":"https://www.foxnews.com/video/6376777027112","publish_date":"2025-08-21 10:00:47","author":"Elizabeth Elkind","authors":["Elizabeth Elkind"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.094},{"id":352892044,"title":"Ex-Paramount chief feared CBS interview of 'drowsy' Biden would be exposed in Trump lawsuit: report","text":"Former Paramount executive Shari Redstone was concerned President Donald Trump's team would seize on unaired footage of a 2023 \"60 Minutes\" interview with then-President Joe Biden, as she explained why the company settled Trump's lawsuit against CBS News. Redstone claimed in an interview with the New York Times that some CBS personnel told her in October 2023 that Biden appeared drowsy and had to be prompted to answer questions during an interview with Scott Pelley. Redstone said she and her son Tyler Korff were worried that CBS would be accused of editing the \"60 Minutes\" interview to conceal Biden's \"failings,\" as the Times put it, while it battled Trump's accusations of election interference stemming from the show's 2024 interview with then-Vice President Kamala Harris. According to the Times report, the Redstone family worried that cherry-picked raw CBS footage and internal communications exposed in discovery would do more damage than the settlement. HOW TRUMP SUED CBS AND WON: THE '60 MINUTES' SETTLEMENT THAT ROCKED THE MEDIA WORLD, EXPLAINED The lawsuit was settled last month, with Trump receiving $16 million upfront to cover legal fees, costs of the case and contributions to his future presidential library or charitable causes. The settlement sparked an uproar, as many critics thought Paramount was surrendering to expedite its pending merger with Skydance Media, even though the lawsuit was seen as frivolous. \"This case was never as black-and-white as people assumed,\" Redstone told the Times. Pelley did say on air at the time that the president seemed tired. \"As we spoke to the president, his secretary of state was in Israel; his defense secretary was at a NATO meeting on Ukraine,\" Pelley said during the broadcast. \"America's oldest president seemed tired from directing all of this.\" '60 MINUTES' REPORTER LESLEY STAHL SAYS SHE'S ANGRY WITH CBS' SHARI REDSTONE OVER TRUMP LAWSUIT \"It had been a rough week, and we could see it on him,\" he added. The Times also reported that other people who witnessed Pelley's interview and reviewed footage believed Redstone's worries about the Biden interview were exaggerated. At the time and for much of Biden's only term, his defenders insisted he was mentally and physically fit for the job despite his advanced age and visible moments of confusion. Biden was ultimately forced to abandon the 2024 Democratic nomination, after his mental fitness concerns were laid bare in his only debate with Trump. He was replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, who went on to lose the race. CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE The settlement paved the way for the Federal Communications Commission to approve the long-planned merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media. That allowed Redstone, who controlled more than three-quarters of Paramount’s Class A voting shares, to exit the newly formed company. Redstone told the New York Times the settlement was a \"no-brainer.\" She recused herself from settlement talks but made it clear that she preferred to reach a deal.

They don’t question liberal claims that biological men can choose to participate in women’s sports, man-made climate change poses such an existential challenge that opportunity costs or contrary evidence must not be considered, and former President Joe Biden maintained his intellectual acuity and vigor to the end. It has reached the point where my conservative colleagues view being attacked by these partisan charlatans who masquerade as objective reporters as a badge of honor.\n\nI recently recorded a video for the Center for a Healthy America expanding on President Donald Trump’s criticisms of Obamacare by noting that former President Barack Obama had promised to reduce insurance premiums, but in fact premiums increased by 80%.\n\nRecently retired Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler awarded me “three Pinocchios” on May 13, 2024. He said Obama stopped promising to reduce premiums after his election and cited a former Obama official who claimed that premiums had previously risen faster. This is the partisan defense one might have expected from a Biden campaign official, but not the remit of a self-proclaimed objective fact-checker.\n\nKessler’s own paper quoted Lucas Graves, a University of Wisconsin–Madison professor: “Within the political establishment on the right, it is now considered quite legitimate — and quite legitimate to say publicly and openly — that you disapprove of fact-checking.” The politicians are simply catching up with their voters.\n\nA 2019 Pew Research Center survey showed 70% of Republicans believed fact-checkers favored one side. Trump complained that the fact-checking during his ABC debate with 2024 Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris amounted to a two-on-one scrum. He again cited fact-checking when he declined to do a 60 Minutes interview and delayed his appearance before the National Association of Black Journalists over their desire to fact-check him.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, who responded to Trump’s first election by launching Meta’s fact-checking program, responded to his second term by joining X in moving from a centralized fact-checking model to crowd-sourced commentary. Zuckerberg acknowledged that fact-checkers had become “politically biased” and cited his desire to prioritize “free expression.” The Department of Homeland Security, under Secretary Kristi Noem, has turned to publishing its own fact-checking corrections of the press on government websites.\n\nGenuine debate between competing ideological viewpoints is healthy for our political discourse. As the saying goes, “iron sharpens iron.” But the irony is that partisan fact-checking has increased polarization. The media appointed themselves the sole arbiters of truth, abused this power in the service of liberal ideology, and abdicated their proper role of reporting unbiased facts and competing political claims on an evenhanded basis.\n\nConservatives have been trained to reject the legacy media, but the temptation is to throw the baby out with the bathwater. Expert opinions should be thoughtfully considered, though not given automatic deference, and many conspiracy theories deserve to be debunked. Voters are better served by hearing both sides. The media should report the news and respect their audiences enough to discern the facts for themselves.\n\nBobby Jindal is the former governor of Louisiana.","summary":"Media fact-checkers self-immolated their credibility when they conspired with Biden government bureaucrats to suppress questions about the possible lab leak origins of COVID-19, the efficacy of masks and social distancing, and vaccine side effects.
