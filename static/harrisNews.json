If we don’t fight, fascism wins”.\n\nThe local man held a sign reading “five-years-old, dude,” a reference to Liam.\n\n“This shouldn’t be happening to anybody, but it absolutely should not be have been happening to children,” he said.\n\nThousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city, as President Donald Trump presses his campaign to deport undocumented immigrants across the country.\n\nOn a visit to Minneapolis on Jan 22, Vice-President JD Vance confirmed Liam was among those detained. But he argued that agents were protecting him after his father “ran” from officers.\n\n“What are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?“ he said.\n\nUN human rights chief Volker Turk called on US authorities to end the “harmful treatment of migrants and refugees”.\n\nMr Arias, the father of the boy, was at a Texas detention facility, according to an ICE database that does not list the whereabouts of under 18s.\n\n‘Dealing with children’ \n\nBorder Patrol senior official Gregory Bovino defended his officers’ treatment of Liam, telling reporters on Jan 23: “I will say unequivocally that we are experts in dealing with children.”\n\nICE commander Marcos Charles said that “my officers did everything they could to reunite him with his family” and alleged that Liam’s family refused to open the door to him after his father left him and ran from officers.\n\nThey would be detained “pending their immigration proceedings,” he added after alleging they entered the United States illegally and were “deportable”.\n\nKiam’s teacher, whose name was given as Ella, called him “a bright, young student”. \n\nIn Minneapolis, where temperatures touched -23 deg C on Jan 23, protesters wrapped in hats, gloves and scarves chanted “ICE out” as part of a broader anti-ICE day of action.\n\nSeparately, protesters picketed outside Minneapolis St Paul airport over the facility’s use for deporting those swept up in immigration raids, with local media citing organisers as saying some 100 clergy were arrested.\n\n‘Being brutal’ \n\nFormer US vice-president Kamala Harris said she was “outraged” by Liam’s detention and called him “just a baby”.\n\nLiam is one of at least four children detained in the same Minneapolis school district this month, administrators said.\n\nMinneapolis has been rocked by increasingly tense protests since federal agents shot and killed Renee Good, an American citizen, on Jan 7.\n\nAn autopsy concluded that killing was a homicide, a classification that does not automatically mean a crime was committed. \n\nThe officer who fired the shots that killed Ms Good, Jonathan Ross, has neither been suspended nor charged. \n\nMr Marc Prokosch, the lawyer for Liam and his father, said they followed the law in applying for asylum in Minneapolis, a sanctuary city where police do not cooperate with federal immigration authorities.\n\nChildren have been caught up in immigration enforcement under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nMinnesota has sought a temporary restraining order for the ICE operation in the state which, if granted by a federal judge, would pause the sweeps. There will be a hearing on the application on Jan 26.\n\nICE were “not following the law, and really they’re being mean to all our neighbors here in Minnesota,” a protester who gave their name only as Aron told AFP.\n\n“They’re actually being brutal.” AFP","url":"https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/thousands-defy-ice-frigid-weather-to-protest-us-immigration-crackdown-and-childs-detention","image":"https://cassette.sphdigital.com.sg/image/straitstimes/767799346cde38a1347ac690ca7e82734b45709e5fcdad8d51d2c1974dbbfeb5","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-24 00:10:00","author":null,"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"sg","sentiment":-0.223},{"id":395517652,"title":"New: Bessent Lights Newsom Up Again With Brutally Funny, Spot-On Take About His Failures","text":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent is a real wit. He's another one of those Cabinet picks who just seems to be perfect for the job. \n\nHe was in Davos this week at the World Economic Forum, along with President Donald Trump. \n\nNow, California Gov. Gavin Newsom was there as well, trying to act like a national leader, but only managing to look desperate for attention.\n\nAs we reported, Bessent had a little fun with Newsom, referring to him as a cross between Patrick Bateman and Sparkle Beach Ken, and the only person in his state who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris. Talk about right on the money. \n\nBessent went on to list some of the things, from homelessness to the Palisades fire, that Newsom had failed on, as he spends his time trying to raise his national profile. \n\nREAD MORE: Watch: Bessent Eviscerates Newsom in Savage Davos Take-Down – 'Patrick Bateman Meets Sparkle Beach Ken'\n\nMeanwhile, Newsom made some weird remarks about Trump being a T.rex. He also waved around some kneepads, claiming they were for foreign dignitaries interacting with Trump. \n\n\"This is diplomacy with Donald Trump. He's a T.rex. You mate with him, or he devours you, one or the other,\" Newsom said Tuesday. \"The Europeans could be (devoured) if they continue down this path and process. They need to stand tall, stand firm, stand united.\"\n\nI don't think that he gets people want someone standing up for America, like a T.rex. Newsom naturally was taking the position of standing up against our present government overseas. Because of course he is. Not a good look. \n\nBessent then had more to say about him. \n\n\"I think Gavin Newsom may be cracking up with some of these things he's saying. I think he may be in over his hairdo.And being on the national stage is very different than being governor of California with no signature achievements, but to say strange things, like President Trump is a Tyrannosaurus rex, what the hell does that mean? I could say, Gavin Newsom is a brontosaurus with a brain the size of a walnut. And if you brought the kneepads, maybe that was for his meeting with Alex Soros.\"\n\nOof, don't hold back there, Bessent. Dude is just savage; that \"in over his hairdo\" crack is great. But it goes to the greater point when it comes to Newsom - there's nothing there but hair gel. What policy can he point to that has made things better for the people of California? You can already tell that he's more focused on his campaign than the state he's supposed to be in charge of. \n\nThat's all Newsom has - rich donor buddies. And those are the Democrats' top choices at the moment - this guy and Kamala Harris? No wonder the Democrats are already flipping out and pre-attacking Vice President JD Vance.

Here's how the Washington Post reported it yesterday.\n\nFive-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos and his father, whom the Department of Homeland Security identified as Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias in an emailed statement, were detained in their driveway Tuesday afternoon, just as they were returning from the child’s school, according to a news release from Columbia Heights Public Schools.The father fled on foot when ICE officers approached him, DHS said. “For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias,” it added.After detaining the father, ICE officers then asked Liam to knock on the door to see if any other people were inside the home, “using a 5-year-old as bait,” according to the school district.Another adult living in the home, who was outside at the time, “begged the agents” to leave the child with them, the school district said. ICE agents refused.\n\nNo one disputes that Adrian Arias fled the scene, leaving his child in the driveway. And no one disputes that ICE agents took the child to the door of the house. But the characterization of ICE using him as \"bait\" is disputed. This comes from someone at the school district who assumed Liam Ramos was brought to the door so that his mother would open the door at which point she would also be arrested by ICE. But ICE disputes that. Here's DHS's response to the post by Ken Martin denying the child was used as \"bait.\"\n\nYou’re lying for clicks yet again.ICE did not, and has never, \"used a child as bait.\" The child was ABANDONED.On January 20, ICE conducted a targeted operation to arrest Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias an illegal alien from Ecuador who was RELEASED into the U.S. by the Biden… https://t.co/bIdW7Wmx3j— U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (@ICEgov) January 22, 2026\n\nEarlier this morning, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin called this story a \"horrific smear.\" She said ICE tried to get his mother to take custody of the child but she refused.\n\nThis is a horrific smear pushed by the media and anti-ICE activists.The child was ABANDONDED by his father, and the alleged mother REFUSED to take custody of her own child. Our law enforcement took care of the child, got him McDonald’s and played him his favorite music to… pic.twitter.com/A6u9Wi9rfZ— Homeland Security (@DHSgov) January 23, 2026\n\nDid the mother really refuse to take custody of her son? CNN has a story up today suggesting that's true.\n\nDHS also said officers “made multiple attempts to get the mother inside the house to take custody of her child. Officers even assured her that they would NOT take her into custody. She refused to accept custody of the child.”But Liam’s mother, who is pregnant and also has a teenage son, was “terrified” of the agents outside her door, said Pastor Sergio Amezcua, who has been helping the mother since her husband and son were taken away.“ICE agents were trying to use the baby to get her to come out of her house, but the neighbors … advised her not to do it,” fearing she would be detained, Amezcua said.\n\nPator Amezcua was not present at the house. And the \"neighbors\" who were telling the mother not to open the door apparently included the boy's father: That's according to a school board member named Mary Granlund who was driving by at the time this all happneed.\n\nShe described a commotion at the scene, with onlookers telling agents: “What are you doing? Don’t take the child!”...When someone recognized the school board chair, Granlund said, they yelled: “The school is here! They can take the child. You don’t have to take them.”Liam’s mother looked out the window, Granlund said, but Liam’s father was yelling, “Please do not open the door! Don’t open the door!”\n\nTo sum all this up, ICE went looking for this individual from Ecuador who they say is here illegally. He and his son were outside in the driveway and when iCE approached the father ran for it. ICE then brought the boy to the door and asked the mother to open the door and take the child. At some point the father was captured and he and other people were telling the mother not to open the door for the boy. At this point, ICE took the father and son into custody and left (this is what is being described as kidnapping) and both were flown to a detention center for families in Texas.\n\nDad ran for it. Mom refused to open the door for him but ICE is to blame. That's how the left sees this.\n\nThere is also some debate about why ICE was targeting Adrian Arias in the first place. It doesn't appear that he has any criminal history or pending charges so it wasn't that. His attorney has claimed he followed the legal process to enter the country under the Biden administration but that is also being disputed by DHS, which claims they have no record of his entry.\n\nNEW: @FoxNews has obtained a DHS photo of ADRIAN ALEXANDER CONEJO ARIAS, the father of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos.

FOX is… pic.twitter.com/RmtcRhizFF— Bill Melugin (@BillMelugin_) January 23, 2026\n\nDespite the fact that this story seems a lot more complicated than some activists initially claimed, the media has mostly gone all in on their framing of the story.\n\n“There is no justifying this,” read the title of USA Today columnist Rex Huppke’s column. “A family separated, a child traumatized: The cruelty of ICE knows no bounds.” ICE’s tactics “can only be described as pure evil,” Minnesota Senator Tina Smith averred. Donald Trump and company “don’t see these families as people, and that’s exactly how they’re treating them,” California Congressman Jimmy Gomez concluded. “How many children is ICE doing this to?” Virginia Representative James Walkinshaw asked. “We need an investigation, now.” The Democratic Party’s official social media organ agreed. “These monsters are sick,” read its denunciation of the law enforcement officers who used a child as “human bait.”\n\nAn equally accurate headline for this story would be \"Illegal immigrants flees ICE, leaving 5-year-old, then begs mother not to take him inside.\" Would that be fair to the father? Maybe not but it's as fair as the actual headlines the media is running are to ICE agents.\n\nEditor’s Note: Do you enjoy Hot Air's conservative reporting that takes on the radical left and woke media?

Even if he still had a five o'clock shadow and a penis, his feelings are what mattered. That's why a guy who was caught pleasuring himself in a Planet Fitness women's restroom said criticism of his lewd act was \"transphobic\" — he identified as a woman, even though video shows he's clearly not. It's also why sex offender Richard Cox was able to enter female locker rooms in and around northern Virginia. Cox said he was a woman. \n\nIn several prisons in America, violent men are put in the same units as female inmates (including on mother-baby units) thanks to their \"gender identity,\" leading to the abuse of those female inmates and punishment from authorities when they speak out (or are victimized). At Framingham in Massachusetts, one inmate wrote, \"\"Many of us here are afraid to speak out due to the repercussions from the transgender population,\" the letter said. \"Most of the male inmates housed at MCI-Framingham still have intact male genitalia; two out of the ten have had surgery.\"\n\nThings are no better in the U.K., where NHS nurse Jennifer Melle was handed a victory in court after being racially abused by a \"trans-identifying man\" who said Melle \"misgendered\" him.\n\nThe point is this: for far too long, transgender activism has run roughshod over women and our rights. They've also pushed to do serious harm to children, which I don't want to minimize, but that's a topic for another column where it can get the attention it deserves. \n\nMany of us simply want a restoration of sanity, a world where women could be left alone in their safe spaces without intact men changing in front of us, and where our shelters and our prisons are single-sexed. We didn't get that, because the Left never takes an inch when they want a mile. They demanded \"inclusivity\" and \"tolerance\" while they erased women or broke us down to our most base biological functions.\n\nIt's part of why Donald Trump won reelection, and the cultural backlash is real. But what's not happening to trans people in America is this: they are not being genocided, and they do not qualify for asylum, in the Netherlands or elsewhere.\n\nBut one has to laugh at the fact they fled the U.S. only to end up in a camp somewhere in Europe.\n\nWhen your TDS convinces you to flee the United States to the Netherlands and you end up thrown in camps. pic.twitter.com/XQ926QBKD1— Sarah 🥨 (@cosmopterix) January 21, 2026\n\nHere's more from that Guardian article (emphasis added):\n\nTer Apel is not a prison, but it looks a little bit like one, surrounded by fences, with guards on every gate. Residents are free to come and go but must be in their rooms each morning for a bed check. After their first few days in the central reception area, asylum seekers are dispersed to different low-rise blocks, where they are given a small food allowance so they can cook their own meals.For Arc, that meant being transferred to what she calls “the queer block”, rather like a student halls of residence where all the LGBT asylum seekers are placed. There, she insists, sharing meals in the communal kitchens and over cigarettes outside, she found common ground.They all feared the police as well as their governments and fellow citizens, she said. “We were in danger from the people around us. And in fact, all of us thought of America as a place we wanted to live in – a beautiful country of opportunities. And that’s all still true, but it was surprising and sad and validating that the people there – a trans dude from Tehran and a trans woman from Libya – our stories were so similar.”Arc knows how that might sound. “I hear a lot of people saying: ‘You are an idiot. You came here from America.’ People will tell me: ‘Did you think about moving to California?’ And then I say: ‘Well, I lived in San Francisco’ and then they go: ‘Oh, that’s a heaven for gay people.’ But it’s different for trans people, particularly for trans women, to the extent that my experience in San Francisco, robot taxis aside, was indistinguishable from [that of] the people that I knew from Libya and Iran and Morocco and Algeria.”Trans men are also unsafe in the US, according to Ashe Wilde, another American who has been living in Ter Apel since the end of October. He transitioned in 2019 and anti-trans hate has only grown since then, he said, particularly with the return of Trump, who was re-elected using the attack ad: “Kamala Harris is for they/them. Trump is for you.”\n\nI'll start by pointing out that the Netherlands doesn't stick asylum seekers in fancy hotels on the taxpayers' dime. Asylum seekers get sent to a camp, often in tents, where they're given an allowance for food they have to cook for themselves. Yet I don't hear a single Leftist complaining about how inhumane those conditions are, like they do whenever we open a camp for migrants here.\n\nBut did you catch what Jane-Michelle Arc, a 47-year-old software engineer from San Francisco, said? He compared San Francisco to Libya, Iran, Morocco, and Algeria, places where homosexuality is not only outlawed but punishable by death. No gay or transperson has died on the streets of San Francisco because of their orientation and gender identity, and it's an insult to the memory of the gays who have died under those regimes to compare them to one of the most \"queer-friendly\" cities in the world.\n\nThere is no such thing as \"transphobia,\" and there is no anti-trans hatred. The Trump administration has made it clear that there are two genders, a biological reality (and here I thought the Left was all about \"following the science\"). Protecting children from mutilation and a lifetime of sexual dysfunction is also not \"anti-trans\" hate. Nor is barring men from women's sports and safe spaces \"anti-trans hate.\" The Left wanted to make all of us ignore biological reality and cater to the whims of a mentally ill minority that seems to have a propensity for violence.\n\nDemocrats insisted that Donald Trump and Mike Pence were going to round up the gays during his first term and put them in camps. That didn't happen, and yet they revisited those same talking points and upped the ante by releasing a study that says there's a \"genocidal process\" against trans people in America.\n\nThere isn't.\n\nBut as the original poster said, the Trump Derangement Syndrome (TDS) is so strong that Leftists will put themselves in the camps they were trying to avoid here, and pretend they're the victims for it.\n\nOh, and this whole thing isn't going to go well for the trans asylum seekers. While they complain about how unfair and tough our immigration system is (it's actually very broken and easily exploited), the Dutch don't mess around and they don't fall for false asylum claims. In November of last year, they denied an asylum claim of a transgender American named Veronica Clifford-Carlos. The court said he \"did not show they are systematically denied protection or access to essential services.\"\n\nOne of the things Trump is very, very good at is getting his opponents to reveal just how unhinged and hypocritical they are, and how quickly they reflexively reject things they believed in and policy positions they once held simply because Trump now supports it. A decade ago, Pence was putting the gays in camps. Now the trans community is putting themselves in camps, hoping to escape the boogeyman they've created in their heads.\n\nThe irony is not lost on me.","url":"https://townhall.com/tipsheet/amy-curtis/2026/01/23/trans-people-netherlands-flee-trump-end-up-in-camps-n2669952","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2025/144/bc4b9b84-ae55-4694-8e77-8a0bbaa45d82.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 23:45:21","author":"Amy Curtis","authors":["Amy Curtis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.062},{"id":395520404,"title":"How Jasmine Crockett Shamelessly Turned A Viral ICE ‘Bait’ Story Into A ‘Kidnapping’ Claim","text":"My daughter is almost 17. She’s smart, empathetic and deeply tuned in to the world around her. Like a lot of teenagers, she gets much of her news from social media. And like a lot of parents, I found myself staring at the ceiling after something she brought up the other night at the dinner table, wondering how something so wrong could sound so convincing. She was trying to process something she had seen and read online. I listened to every word and stayed quiet, partly because I didn’t yet know the facts, and partly because I wanted to understand how the story had landed with her. The spark was a viral claim that ICE used a 5-year-old boy as \"bait\" to capture his father, who was in the country illegally. The images were emotional, the language inflammatory. And the framing was unmistakable: this wasn’t immigration enforcement, it was cruelty. Hillary Clinton said ICE was using children as \"pawns,\" and Kamala Harris echoed the \"bait\" term. Some went further. Rep. Jasmine Crockett, a U.S. Senate hopeful, publicly described the incident as a \"kidnapping.\" That wasn’t a careless word choice. It was a loaded accusation, delivered without hesitation, and released into an ecosystem that rewards outrage far more than accuracy. From there, the escalation was predictable. Online, the comparisons piled up quickly: fascism, Nazis, Hitler. My daughter, trying to make sense of what she was being shown by people she’s been taught to trust, said it reminded her of the kinds of things Nazis had done in the 1930s and '40s. That didn’t strike me as irrational. It struck me as learned behavior. For years now, kids have watched adults, especially authority figures, respond to political events with certainty, panic and the most extreme historical language available. I’ve seen it up close. Last year, the day after Donald Trump was elected, one of my daughter’s track coaches confronted me at the school, where I was an assistant coach on the team. She was waiting for me, visibly angry. In front of more than a dozen members of the team, and without provocation, she loudly lectured me about how the country was now in grave danger, how the LGBTQ community was immediately unsafe, how abortion rights would be stripped, how everything had changed overnight. She was unhinged and unprofessional, and I was embarrassed for her. She made assumptions about my politics without ever having asked, and she delivered those assumptions publicly, as fact, to a group of kids who were watching how adults handle disagreement and uncertainty. That moment stayed with me, because it revealed something important: kids don’t just absorb information; they absorb tone. They learn which emotions are rewarded, which words carry moral authority, and which comparisons are treated as acceptable shorthand. So, when my daughter echoed the language she’d been hearing — when she reached for the most extreme historical analogy she knew — I didn’t hear recklessness. I heard the downstream effect of years of modeled hysteria. Here’s the problem: the ICE \"bait\" story wasn’t true. Had it been, I would have been enraged, too. None of this requires pretending immigration enforcement is easy, clean or painless. It isn’t. Families get separated. Children get scared. Even when the law is being enforced properly, the human cost is real, and it deserves to be acknowledged honestly. That’s exactly why the facts matter so much. When false stories spread, they don’t just mislead the public; they deepen fear among immigrant communities and make an already difficult reality even harder to navigate. According to DHS officials, what actually happened was far less sinister than what was being spun online. During an enforcement action, the father, in this country illegally, fled, leaving his young son behind. One officer stayed with the child to ensure his safety while another pursued the father. This was not a kidnapping. That detail didn’t go viral. The accusation did. This is how misinformation works now. You don’t need to fabricate an entire story. You just remove enough context, add a charged word or two, and let the algorithm do the rest. And suddenly, a teenager is wondering aloud whether she’s watching the early stages of Nazism play out on her phone. That should alarm us, not because of the teenager, but because of the adults. Words matter. History matters. When elected officials casually accuse law enforcement of kidnapping without evidence, they aren’t just scoring political points. They’re teaching a generation that facts are optional if the narrative feels righteous enough. When educators and authority figures normalize Nazi comparisons as everyday rhetoric, they flatten history into a political prop. Nazism wasn’t harsh rhetoric or unpopular policy. It was a totalitarian system that stripped people of rights, humanity and, eventually, life itself. Millions were murdered. There were no free elections. No free press. No lawful way to object without disappearing. Treating that history as a reusable insult doesn’t make us more vigilant; it makes us careless. My daughter deserves better than that. So do your children. Her instinct to care is a strength. The people who exploit that instinct for clicks, clout or political advantage are the ones who should be answering hard questions. If we’re serious about protecting kids, maybe we should start by telling them the truth.","summary":"When politicians call law enforcement “kidnappers,&quot; kids listen.

Are they supposed to let a five-year-old child freeze to death?” he said.\n\nThe UN human rights chief Volker Turk called on US authorities to end the “dehumanizing portrayal and harmful treatment of migrants and refugees.”\n\nDemocratic congressman Joaquin Castro, whose Texas constituency includes a San Antonio ICE detention center to which it was thought Ramos was taken, said he was seeking updates on his welfare and whereabouts.\n\n– ‘Dealing with children’ –\n\nBorder Patrol senior official Gregory Bovino defended his officers’ treatment of Ramos, telling reporters Friday: “I will say unequivocally that we are experts in dealing with children.”\n\nICE commander Marcos Charles said Friday “my officers did everything they could to reunite him with his family” and alleged that Ramos’s family refused to open the door to him after his father left him and ran from officers.\n\nRamos and his father were at a “family residential center pending their immigration proceedings,” he added after alleging they entered the United States illegally and were “deportable.”\n\nCharles claimed that “agitators” with shields had gathered outside the federal facility where he was speaking, a flashpoint for anti-ICE protests. \n\nThe Hennepin County Sheriff’s Office said dispersal orders were issued for an “unlawful protest.”\n\nRamos’s teacher, whose name was given as Ella, called him “a bright young student.”\n\n“All I want is for him to be back here and safe,” she said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nIn Minneapolis, where temperatures touched -23C (-9F) on Friday, protesters wrapped in hats, gloves and scarves chanted “ICE out” after anti-Trump group Indivisible Twin Cities called for a day of “No work. No school. No shopping” as part of a broader anti-ICE protest action.\n\nSeparately, protesters picketed outside Minneapolis St. Paul airport over the facility’s use for deporting those swept up in immigration raids, with local media citing organizers as saying some 100 clergy were arrested.\n\n– ‘Just a baby’ –\n\nFormer US vice president Kamala Harris said she was “outraged” by Ramos’s detention and called him “just a baby.”\n\nRamos is one of at least four children detained in the same Minneapolis school district this month, local administrators said.\n\nMinneapolis has been rocked by increasingly tense protests since federal agents shot and killed US citizen Renee Good on January 7.\n\nAn autopsy concluded that killing was a homicide, a classification that does not automatically mean a crime was committed.\n\nThe officer who fired the shots that killed Good, Jonathan Ross, has neither been suspended nor charged.\n\nMarc Prokosch, the lawyer for Ramos and his father, said they followed the law in applying for asylum in Minneapolis, which is a sanctuary city where police do not cooperate with federal immigration.\n\nChildren have long been caught up in federal immigration enforcement, under both Republican and Democratic administrations.\n\nMinnesota has sought a temporary restraining order for the ICE operation in the state which, if granted by a federal judge, would pause the sweeps. There will be a hearing on the application Monday.","summary":"Thousands join a Minneapolis protest after the ICE detention of a 5-year-old boy sparks outrage.

The 41-year-old's first big splash, new CBS Evening News anchor Tony Dokoupil, has been met with ridicule and, even worse, low ratings.\n\nThe new anchor got off to a rough start on Monday, January 5, after suffering an on-air meltdown during a confusing night-one broadcast. Tuesday saw a strong negative reaction to what many deemed a \"fluff piece\" on Secretary of State Marco Rubio.\n\nThe unplanned mistakes, along with the \"Bari backlash,\" led to the new guy doing worse than his predecessors. \n\nRatings for Dokoupil's Monday debut were significantly down across major advertising demographics. According to Nielsen data obtained by Radar, viewership was down 22 percent compared with the same day last year.\n\nOne insider blasted the newscasts and the mistakes.\n\n\"Talk about amateur hour – CBS couldn’t even get through a 30-minute show without massive errors,\" the source shared. \"And this guy is delusional enough to throw shade at Walter Cronkite?\"Trump Goes on a TearIt likely didn't help when Dokoupil found himself getting a media tongue-lashing from Donald Trump, who said the anchor owed him his job.\n\nDokoupil reported from Detroit last week and joined the president for a tour of a Ford plant. While speaking with Trump, the new anchor asked about the economy and mentioned the continuously rising gas prices.\n\nThat set the president off, who replied with his familiar talking points, only this time, tailored to Dokoupil and his own job security.\n\n\"We have now the hottest country in the world. And a year and a half ago our country was dead. We had a dead country,\" he told Dokoupil, before bringing up his prediction if Kamala Harris had won the 2024 election. \"You wouldn't have a job right now. If she got in, you probably wouldn't have a job right now. Your boss, who's an amazing guy, might be bust, okay?\"\n\nHis boss, Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison, is a friend of Trump's, who had promised to bring more conservative reporting to the network.Dokoupil's Big PaydayTrump continued: \"Let me just tell you, you wouldn't have this job. You wouldn't have this job, certainly, whatever the h-- they're paying you. Our country is rocketing right now. We have the hottest country in the world. If they got in, we would be Venezuela on steroids.\"\n\nDokoupil, evidently rattled by the president's charge, came back to his comments at the very end of their discussion, telling Trump: \"For the record, I do think I'd have this job even if the other guys won.\"\n\nWithout hesitation, Trump fired back: \"Yeah, but at a lesser salary.

After all, CBS got to do it for just 16 million,\" Colbert said on his show. \"Check my math. Check my math on that one.\"\n\nThe joke likely refers to Paramount's $16 million settlement in July in a lawsuit filed by Trump, who alleged the network deceptively edited an interview that aired on its \"60 Minutes\" news program featuring then-Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nColbert's dig toward CBS comes as \"The Late Show\" is set to air its final episode in May. Paramount canceled the late-night talk show last May, calling it \"purely a financial decision against a challenging backdrop in late night.\"\n\nColbert says new FCC guidance is trying to 'silence' late-night TV\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission issued a Jan. 21 public notice with new guidance stating that daytime and late-night television talk shows do not have a blanket exemption under the Communications Act of 1934.\n\nThe law required FCC licensees, both in radio and later in television, to offer equal broadcast opportunities to political candidates and was amended in 1959 to exempt newscasts, news interviews, news documentaries and on-the-spot coverage of news events.\n\nColbert said the new guidance was an attempt to silence him, Seth Meyers and Jimmy Kimmel, whose show ABC temporarily pulled off the air after FCC Chair Brendan Carr made comments interpreted by some as a threat to pull the ABC station licenses if Kimmel wasn't fired over remarks about Charlie Kirk's assassination.\n\n\"Hey, I'm flattered you think that appearing on my show has the power to affect politics in any way, OK? I've been doing this job for 21 years, and let me tell you something, buddy. If our government had turned out the way I had chosen, you would not have the power to make this announcement,\" Colbert quipped.\n\nFollowing the FCC's public notice, Carr said on X Jan. 21 that the new guidance reminds talk shows to remember their obligation to \"provide all candidates with equal opportunities.\"\n\n\"For years, legacy TV networks assumed that their late night & daytime talk shows qualify as 'bona fide news' programs - even when motivated by purely partisan political purposes,\" he wrote.","url":"https://eu.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2026/01/23/stephen-colbert-cbs-trump-fcc/88323105007/","image":"https://www.gannett-cdn.com/authoring/authoring-images/2026/01/23/USAT/88323333007-20251114-t-105517-z-1254556023-rc-22-whalqibb-rtrmadp-3-awardsgqmotyla.JPG?auto=webp&crop=4528,2547,x0,y252&format=pjpg&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 22:22:58","author":"Usa Today","authors":["Usa Today"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.173},{"id":395505698,"title":"Vance crushes false narrative about ICE 'arresting' 5-year-old boy","text":"An image was circulated widely this week showing a visibly upset preschooler wearing an oversized hat and Spider-man backpack standing in the company of federal immigration agents. Evidently loath to investigate the circumstances surrounding the photo and what it actually depicts, Democrats and other radicals rushed to condemn U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\n\nMinneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey (D), for instance, suggested ICE had treated the boy like a criminal, while twice-failed presidential candidate Kamala Harris wrote that he \"is just a baby. He should be at home with his family, not used as bait by ICE and held in a Texas detention center. I am outraged, and you should be too.\"\n\n'No one thinks that makes any sense.'\n\nNew York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D) went a step further, accusing ICE of \"kidnapping 5-year-olds and using them as bait\" and suggesting the agency should be defunded.\n\nThe liberal media didn't appear particularly eager to correct Democrats' false narrative, which was incubated by woke officials with Columbia Heights Public Schools, where the child was reportedly enrolled.\n\nDuring his visit to Minneapolis on Thursday, Vice President JD Vance gave the press a reality check, noting that anti-ICE propagandists glossed over some critical information about the incident.\n\n\"I actually saw this terrible story while I was coming to Minneapolis,\" said the vice president. \n\n\"And I see this story, and I'm a father of a 5-year-old — actually, a 5-year-old little boy. And I think to myself, 'Oh my God, this is terrible. How do we arrest a 5-year-old?'\"\n\n\"Well I do a little bit more follow-up research, and what I find is that the 5-year-old was not arrested; that his dad was an illegal alien; and when they went to arrest his illegal alien father, the father ran,\" said Vance.\n\nRELATED: 'Going to get someone killed': Democratic AG shocks with talk about shooting ICE agents in 'stand your ground' Arizona \n\n Photo by Jim Watson - Pool/Getty Images\n\nVance told the Minneapolis crowd, \"So the story is that ICE detained a 5-year-old. Well what are they supposed to do? Are they supposed to let a 5-year-old child freeze to death? Are they not supposed to arrest an illegal alien in the United States of America?\"\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security indicated that when ICE attempted to arrest the boy's father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, in the Minneapolis suburb of Columbia Heights on Jan. 20, the illegal alien from Ecuador \"fled on foot — abandoning his child.\"\n\nMarcos Charles, the assistant director of enforcement and removal operations for ICE, indicated on Friday that after the illegal alien ditched his little boy and was arrested, ICE officers \"stayed with the child. They cared for him, took him to get something to eat from a drive-thru restaurant, and spent hours ensuring he was taken care of. Again my officers did that. Not his father.\"\n\nCharles noted further that people inside the illegal alien's apparent residence refused to open the door for the young boy and take him back.\n\nAccording to DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, the boy's alleged mother was inside the house and would not let him in even after officers assured her that she wouldn't be taken into custody.\n\nMarc Prokosch, a lawyer representing the family, indicated during a press conference on Thursday that the boy and his father were reunited and are being kept together at the Dilley Immigration Processing Center, a family holding center in Dilley, Texas.\n\n \"Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children, or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administration’s immigration enforcement,\" said DHS.\n\nThe vice president further suggested that the argument that ICE cannot arrest illegal aliens who have children is unworkable given that'd mean \"every single parent is going to be completely given immunity from ever being the subject of law enforcement.\"\n\n\"That doesn't make any sense.

Josh Shapiro if he had \"ever been an agent of the Israeli government\" during its vice presidential vetting process. In an op-ed Friday for The Washington Post, Kirchick wrote that the Harris campaign's implication that Shapiro harbors dual loyalty to the United States and Israel \"marks yet another sad chapter in the Democratic Party’s ongoing betrayal of American Jews.\" \"The most charitable explanation for this implication of dual loyalty, one of the oldest of antisemitic defamations, is incompetence,\" he wrote. \"Since Shapiro’s emergence as a national political figure, many progressives have alleged that he ‘served’ in the Israel Defense Forces.\" OBAMA WINGMAN ERIC HOLDER DEFENDED WALZ'S VETTING, THEN MINNESOTA’S FRAUD SCANDAL ERUPTED According to Kirchick, the claim that Shapiro served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) \"butchers the truth,\" saying the governor merely took part in a high school volunteer program that involved working on a kibbutz and assisting at an Israeli military base. \"Perhaps Dana Remus, a former official for the Obama and Biden administrations who challenged Shapiro’s American bona fides, and her boss, former attorney general Eric H. Holder Jr., just had bad information,\" Kirchick wrote. \"Assuming that Remus and Holder are both familiar with Google, however, it’s fair to suspect that the real reason the Harris campaign was concerned about Shapiro was that he’s a vocally pro-Israel Jew.\" Kirchick argued that even if Shapiro had served in the IDF, \"the left’s fixation on him represents a glaring double standard,\" adding that \"what sets off progressives isn’t the principle of serving in a foreign army, but serving in the army of the Jewish state.\" Later in the op-ed, Kirchick argued that if \"progressives were more self-aware,\" they would take time to think \"before suggesting that Jewish Americans with connections to Israel, a key democratic U.S. ally, are somehow disloyal.\" \"After all, there is also a long, dishonorable tradition of progressives explicitly rooting for America’s enemies abroad,\" he added, claiming progressives \"wanted the Vietcong to win\" against the U.S. during the Vietnam War, among other examples. WALZ’S LONG-RUNNING FRAUD SCANDAL PUTS HARRIS CAMPAIGN JUDGMENT UNDER SCRUTINY In closing, the author asserted the \"appropriateness of Americans joining foreign military forces,\" such as Israel, \"boils down to one's worldview.\" He wrote that those who view Israel as an ally see Americans who served in the IDF as part of the \"same admirable continuum\" as those who defended the Spanish Republic and against Nazism. Conversely, Kirchick added, those \"such as Holder and Remus\" view a \"connection to Israel that many Americans share constitutes a potential counterintelligence threat.\" \"By casting aspersions on one of the Democratic Party’s most loyal and generous constituencies, progressives have shown what side they’re on,\" he concluded.

One question he said he received during the vetting process included: \"Have you ever been an agent of the Israeli government?\" \"Had I been a double agent for Israel? Was she kidding? I told her how offensive the question was,\" Shapiro wrote. \"Remus was just doing her job. I get it. But the fact that she asked, or was told to ask that question by someone else, said a lot about some of the people around the VP.\" Shapiro described further probing about his views on political topics, such as whether he'd be willing to \"apologize for some of his comments about protesters at the University of Pennsylvania who had built encampments to decry Israel’s military campaign in Gaza and, in some cases, intimidated Jewish students.\" CLICK HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE FOX NEWS APP Shapiro added that he ultimately declined the running mate offer after Remus suggested the position \"might be a financial burden for him and his wife.\" Fox News Digital's Linsay Kornick contributed to this report.","summary":"Author James Kirchick criticized Kamala Harris&apos; campaign team for allegedly asking Pennsylvania Gov.

He's here this week with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros, and Davos is a perfect place for a man who, when everyone else is on lockdown, when he was having people arrested for going to church,\" Bessent said. \"Shame on him. He is too smug, too self-absorbed, and too economically illiterate to know anything.\"\n\nBut Bessent wasn’t done with Newsom. During a Friday interview at Davos, Bessent responded to Newsom's bizarre comparison of President Trump to a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and it was savage.\n\nRecommended: Here’s the Infuriating Reason Don Lemon Avoided Charges in the Church Mob Incident\n\n“I think Gavin Newsom may be cracking up with some of these things he's saying. I think he may be in over his hairdo, and, you know, being on the national stage is very different than being governor of California, you know, with no signature achievements,” he said. “But to say strange things like, ‘President Trump is a Tyrannosaurus Rex,’ what the hell does that mean?

The problem? It's backfiring spectacularly. Instead of elevating his standing, Newsom's performances are exposing his weaknesses. Even Stephen A. Smith blasted Newsom for his behavior at Davos.\n\n“Gavin Newsom, respectfully, what are you doing?” Smith asked on his podcast earlier this week. “You’re the governor of the state of California in the United States of America. Why are you over in Davos, Switzerland, talking to folks and speaking negatively about the president of the United States?”\n\nHe added, “I have no problem with Gavin Newsom being candid and open about his feelings about our president on United States soil.”\n\nNewsom is all hair gel and no substance. He can slick back his hair and smile for the cameras, and yet, he can’t even come out looking good after a tiff with Bessent.\n\nWant to support fearless journalism that exposes the Left and tells the stories the media won’t?

Trump gave little detail on what the board plans to do but said, “it would work with the United Nations to ensure peace in the Middle East and hinted at wider ambitions,” CBS News reported.\n\n Joining the charter reportedly requires a lofty $1 billion membership fee, though it remains unclear what the money will be used for, according to multiple outlets.\n\n Few Western nations have expressed interest in joining the new group, which is mostly made up of countries in the Middle East, Asia and South America.\n\n Nations who have accepted Trump's invite, according to CNN, include Albania, Argentina, Bahrain, Bulgaria, Egypt, Hungary, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Kosovo, Mongolia, Morocco, Pakistan, Paraguay, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.\n\n The executive board has been filled out with appointed members: U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East Steve Witkoff, Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, former U.K. Prime Minister Tony Blair, billionaire businessman Marc Rowan, World Bank Group president Ajay Banga and U.S. deputy national security adviser Robert Gabriel.\n\n The board will be indefinitely chaired by Trump.\n\n On Thursday, Jan 22, during his monologue on The Late Show, Colbert, 61, called Trump’s billion-dollar entry fee for the Board of Peace “a little steep,” then taking a jab at his own employer by saying that CBS agreed to “obey” the president for far less.\n\n “Why, you may ask, is this even happening? Good question, me,” Colbert prefaced his roast. “Especially because the Board of Peace’s mission would overlap with the United Nations’ aim of maintaining international peace and security. So, Trump is literally just doing model UN.”\n\n “Now, admittedly, the idea of paying a billion dollars to obey Donald Trump seems a little steep,\" the comedian added. \"After all, CBS got to do it for just 16 million.”\n\n Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\n Colbert has previously been critical of CBS' decision to settle a lawsuit with Trump for $16 million, which will be donated to his future presidential library.\n\n Three days before CBS made the shocking announcement that The Late Show would be canceled after its current season, Colbert criticized the network’s parent company for agreeing to settle a lawsuit with Trump. The president had accused journalists at 60 Minutes of deceptively editing a 2024 interview with his election opponent, Kamala Harris.\n\n “I believe this kind of complicated financial settlement with a sitting government official has a technical name in legal circles: it’s 'big, fat bribe,' \" Colbert said on The Late Show last July.\n\n Later in the week, Colbert revealed his show would be retired, with CBS insisting it was “purely a financial decision.”\n\n Trump celebrated the news of Colbert's ousting on Truth Social soon after, writing, \"I absolutely love that Colbert got fired\" before saying, \"I hear Jimmy Kimmel is next.\"","summary":"Colbert mocked Trump's new international peace body, which other Western nations have largely opposed, and threw a dig at his employer in the process","url":"https://people.com/stephen-colbert-mocks-trump-board-of-peace-cbs-settlement-11891394","image":"https://people.com/thmb/DpVXd6MAXgwoERRVYUEjAZI8l0o=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Stephen-Colbert-Donald-Trump-122925-ab840b8aa54441bbbfaac11cd0604598.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 19:03:50","author":"Paloma Chavez","authors":["Paloma Chavez"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":395501208,"title":"Despite Setting A Record For Nominations, History Tells Us That ‘Sinners’ Isn’t A Lock To Win Big At The Oscars","text":"Being twice as good and working twice as hard is the baseline, not a guarantee.\n\nThe Grammys reminded Beyoncé of that lesson, and the last Presidential election echoed that truth through Kamala Harris.

They say the review is “a naked act of political retribution” against critics of Trump and OMB Director Russell Vought, who has led the administration’s efforts to slash the federal budget and workforce. \n\n“This is a classic tactic used by Donald Trump and Russell Vought to intimidate and bully people he thinks are his enemies,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). “People are tired of his antics.

Abigail Spanberger (D-VA). Virginia and every other state included in the review voted for then-Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election.\n\nThe move by OMB is reminiscent of Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency’s efforts to trim the federal budget through aggressive tactics.\n\nSen. Patty Murray (D-WA), the top Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, blasted the review as “another tired re-run of Russ Vought’s corrupt playbook” on X. \n\n“No one should be intimidated. Vought and Trump can kick rocks. This will not stand,” she added.\n\nThe Trump administration has ramped up a crackdown on fraud from Democratic states following the revelation of a Minnesota fraud scandal involving Somali immigrants accused of defrauding multiple government social services programs of at least $1 billion. Trump has repeatedly slammed Gov. Tim Walz (D-MN) and Somali-American Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) over the scandal.\n\nVice President JD Vance visited the state on Thursday, where he implored local leaders to work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop the violent clashes between law enforcement and protesters.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to cut federal funding to Democratic states on Feb. 1 over their support for sanctuary cities. The administration also cut $10 billion in funds for child care and social services in five states — California, New York, Illinois, Colorado, and Minnesota. But a federal judge in New York temporarily blocked the administration from freezing the funding earlier this month.\n\nDemocrats have continued to challenge Trump’s efforts to slash funding in court, but the OMB review marks an escalation of the White House’s attacks against the minority party, Democrats bemoaned. \n\n“This is a blatant and dangerous abuse of power.

These other countries must be called out, and I pray President Barrow and other African+ leaders not just resist Trump, but learn the dangers of worshipping power. I may wish some African leaders or media houses would learn to even confront Trump with at least smart wordings or echoing of folks like Elon Musk. How is Western media versus Western leaders on this so far? I am impressed by Musk's smart reaction by re-describing it as 'Board of Piece,' I want a piece of Venezuela, and a piece of Gaza, etc' . I think that was divinely inspired, and all leaders were supposed to share and add to that astute description. If the PM of Canada added: piece of Canada; Gambia, Nigeria, or xyz says: 'piece of Gambia if new special resources or national security fears warrant arrogance, etc.' I think the Democrats are partly responsible for Trump rising to power and under confronting him compared to Musk on this particular issue. Our era has independent leaning testing, because loyalty to a person or a political group is increasingly dangerous. Loyalty should be primarily to truth, principles, or conscience in a nutshell. You may occasionally seem like 'a hypocrite' to cowards like the censoring Democrats who lost Twitter and Musk over censorship...\n\nThe world is a mess, because the comment by Putin on Greenland is very troubling. When Putin indifferently puts a dollar value on Greenland, it signals a different form of slavery is still acceptable to at least Putin and those who worship him too... The resources and the people of Greenland are worth about one billion dollars through 'arranged marriage', referendum through which terms of coercion, or dowry in a new form with or without the possibility of divorce? What sin did humans commit to be tested with such leaders, or are the soldiers without conscience to blame? The dangerous respite : [Quran 17:64] \"And entice whomever of them you can with your voice (promises), and rally against them your cavalry (troops) and your infantry [to cause fear], and share with them in wealth and children, and make promises to them.\" But Satan promises them nothing but delusion.\n\nAlthough I have not read his Charter yet, the reports are enough to dismiss it. Trump will highlight a fractional fact and offer something worse, sometimes with more lies. For example, the UN indeed failed the world in what percentage is a fact. However, the UN charter was not 100% perfect in the first place, but about 75% pass in theory and perhaps 60% score in practice can be the wild estimates. Among the reasons the UN failed is the unjust Veto powers to about five elite members, so suggesting One Veto power as replacement is likely going to be much worse. Is it Trump as an indefinite chair or who will take over if he dies or incapable at some point? Of course, allowing this board to exist even for one month is too dangerous. So I expect the people of Turkey and all who joined to rise and force their power worshipping leaders to have an alibi to retract from the Board. The media and the opposition in these countries must try to spearhead such movements. Many of these leaders do not have the balls to say no to Trump. You can make laws, use the judiciary on sovereignty and dangerous alliance grounds, or even mass protests as a last resort. Anyone of those could work and reduce Trump's plans to nothing, because the weak leaders may then repent...\n\nIn regards to the one billion dollars payment, I doubt if even Saudi-Arabia dares to 'bribe' that money to be vetoed as a slave of Trump, not Allah? Trump is essentially forming a company, robbing mentally, or saying a Trump leading a private army for months on which terms will be better than the UN or xyz? If it is the u.s military, then succession should be u.s president, not Trump for life. Worse case scenario, how many other administrations will allow it after Trump's term expires? Perhaps using u.s courts may also help stop it, but Capitalism over-commercialises even the judiciary, and if the robbery affects only non Americans, then good luck.\n\nIt is very confusing, because I do not understand how a nearly dying billionaire thinks more billions through deceptions is smart. Either he thinks leaving inheritance to his kids will save him from a just God, or if a billion people worship him, he will be above those who worship him in hell? Although I still struggle to wonder if Ms. Clinton was not worse in 2016. If you agree Trump is getting worse, then we must also agree Clinton or anyone is capable of getting worse or better in our confusing earth. If you gauged the words of Clinton on Gaza and Israel in 2025, contrast how Elon Musk fought more than Clinton+ against the bill that funded ICE+, and others, then you know why I said Ms. Clinton is not good and capable of getting worse with or without more power. I have opposed Trump more than I supported him. Folks like Elon Musk was impressive in taking over Twitter or now X for free speech, except he also supports censorship, especially outside the u.s. I can agree Twitter or X helped Trump win, but I cannot agree the financial donations of Musk to Trump is as significant as fairly smart folks like Bernie Sanders and many media houses claim or exaggerated. My evidence is Ms. Clinton raised much more money than Trump and still lost. I am too lazy to research if Kamala Harris raised more or not, but it will be too close to claim money as a primary factor. Like in real life, money plays an important role but often exaggerated in politics and beyond. When folks like Ms. Clinton were openly talking about 'total control' of social media and Tim Walz justifying censorship in the name of kindness, Trump was at least lying 'censorship will end'. Blame those who couldn't see through the lies of Trump after hunting Julian Assange, but please admit until the Democrats+ understand the dangers of censorship, then they are blame worthy. Those who fear even non threatening words or think truthful words cannot defeat lying or cruel words are blind or unable to sacrifice money and lives where need be. This is why no top Democrat is yet to even see the benefits of urging mass culture of cameras.\n\nThe world of information is where the main battle is. The Shortcomings of mainstream media are real, and Trump exploited it similarly. The mainstream media can admit it and adjust, or we understand if the mainstream media were 75% truthful then choose carefully and never defend lies. Social media is where the real divide occurs, where some think money is everything or number of followers for money or what else? Capitalism has us running, but even illusions can be dangerous. So how can you say Social media is at 40%, 60% or 90% truthful, or each influencer and your personal sharing are 100% truthful? How many times have you been deceived through sharing, or are you to share only what you agree with 100%? Are you more comfortable in quoting or sharing the imperfect mainstream media of which countries, which social media folks, or what you know or captured through cameras? Tolerance in what is intelligent differences cannot be the same as Tolerance on known lies or cruelty. This is precisely why I supported and lambasted Obama while I thought he was slightly better. He contributed against me in censorship and look what he did to Julian Assange through credit cards controlling. A dangerous team passed the baton and Trump learned how to control companies worse than Obama, persecuted Assange worse than Obama, and now you want to tell me 'better hell or better devil' means ignoring truth as illusory intelligence? Trump understands people love truth to even name his social media Truth social, but names and reality can be very different. However, information remains the primary way even God rescues people in many ways. I often say: I am yet to see God or Satan physically, so only truth and kindness in and outside my head are how I identify truth or who to worship through my choices. When you notice a lying person in this age, separate until they understand 100% truth matters. Until then, I believe the strongest culture of cameras is the best means to truthful information, confronting and defeating the devils, the liars and cruel ones. They are spending billions on weapons, AI, and now such a board can be a long useless debate? Are you ready to spend billions or what percentage of your annual income towards cameras for self and those you claim to love? Remember, the marvelous Quhr-aahn and common sense says: you must be willing to 'sacrifice your wealth and risk your lives for God or truth's cause' in multiple chapters. The word God means intelligence, truth, and kindness in a nutshell. Once you study 'God's cause' from conscience or even the Quhr-aahnic perspective, you know anti-oppression or freeing of the oppressed is where we must spend money, time, and risk our lives.\n\nI am not interested in hearing how Israel or Aipac is spending billions in u.s politics, I want to know how the Arabs are spending billions on products or which types of education+? I want to know why African leaders think road infrastructure or xyz is more important than universal education, or those who gamble and sacrifice orphans and children of the poor may not be like or worse than Trump. Trump risked his money and life for good or evil before you, but when will you do better or offer excuses? Guilty parents exist from the reason of having and how they treat children; guilty parents exist in the leaders and systems they choose against their children or whose children? Guilty leaders also exist, but how do we confront and potentially defeat guilty leaders is a complex test of efforts, truth, and patience with branches and limits, as per ch.103.\n\nSome of you are blind to many things, so you may never understand how more cameras can significantly help reduce the crimes of Trump through ICE and how cameras can help deter wars or help solve war crimes. So ask what we can do, not just the evil of Trump and those supporting him in different ways. May God bless me much more , those with me, and bless Showlove Trinity: let's learn, let's work, let's have fun.\n\nBy Jarga Kebba GigoAn Activist and TransformerAuthor of Juts Quhr-aahn","url":"https://www.modernghana.com/news/1465981/the-dangers-of-under-confronting-trumps-board.html","image":"https://cdn.modernghana.com/images/content/328202535239-otkvn0y442-jarga-kebba-gigo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 18:24:00","author":"Jarga Kebba Gigo","authors":["Jarga Kebba Gigo"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"gh","sentiment":-0.067},{"id":395433508,"title":"ICE accused of using five-year-old child as ‘bait’ in Minneapolis immigration raids","text":"We need your help now\n\nSupport from readers like you keeps The Journal open.\n\nYou are visiting us because we have something you value.

The purpose is “to collect a detailed spending report on Federal funds provided to entities in a select list of States” so the federal government can “better understand the scope of funding in certain States and localities in order to facilitate efforts to reduce the improper and fraudulent use of those funds through administrative means or legislative proposals to Congress.”\n\nThe OMB emphasizes that this is “a data-gathering exercise only” and that “it does not involve withholding funds, and therefore does not violate any court order.” \n\nThe memo defines “federal funds” to include “all grants (including grants then provided as subcontracts or subgrants to other entities), cooperative agreements, loans, contracts (including subcontracts), and other monetary awards” allocated to state and local governments, colleges, and nonprofits in the targeted states.\n\nThe request signals a dramatic escalation of the Trump administration’s increasingly aggressive strategy to target federal funding in blue states – an unprecedented policy approach triggered during last year’s government shutdown that has rapidly accelerated in the wake of sweeping fraud allegations in Minnesota.OMB Director Russel Vought has run point on the effort after spending President Donald Trump’s past year in office re-engineering tools used by the agency, known as the federal government’s “nerve center,” to exert new authority and power over the federal spending process.The memo directs agencies to include in their spending reports all grants, loans, contracts, subcontracts and “other monetary awards” provided to 13 states and Washington, DC. All of the states voted for Democratic nominee and former Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election and 12 of the 13 states have Democratic governors.

Why It Matters ICE is facing growing scrutiny following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good by an agent in Minneapolis earlier this month. Several reports about their tactics used in immigration enforcement operations, such as allegations that they have used children as “bait,” have raised eyebrows among critics of the agency. This week, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) announced “Operation Catch of the Day” in Maine. Golden who represents the state’s more conservative-leaning 2nd Congressional District, was among a handful of Democrats who voted to advance a DHS funding this week as operations occur in his home state. What to Know ICE operations in Maine have drawn condemnation and concern from many Democrats in the state such as Governor Janet Mills. Golden, in a statement released on Thursday, struck a different tone, writing that agents have “the right and responsibility to enforce federal laws, including immigration laws.” “A targeted law enforcement operation focused on individuals who have engaged in criminal activity serves the public interest,” he wrote, adding that DHS should prioritize enforcement and must comply with federal laws. He also addressed potential protests over ICE operations. There have been some protests in Portland, Maine, the state’s largest city, but they have so far generally remained peaceful and have not drawn the same attention as those around Minneapolis. “Free speech and lawful protest are protected rights, but regardless of how anyone feels about immigration policy or ICE’s tactics, people must not obstruct or impede law enforcement activities,” the congressman wrote. “And all of us—including public officials—must resist the urge to amplify tensions or spread unverified reports. That is a recipe for confrontation and escalation that helps no one.” Golden has faced criticism from more progressive Democrats over his stance on ICE, with commentator Wajahat Ali responding on X, “Retire today, you feckless coward.” Golden represents a congressional district consisting of the state’s more conservative rural areas as well as some more Democratic-leaning cities like Bangor and Lewiston. Trump won the district by nearly 10 points in 2024 against then-Vice President Kamala Harris, while Golden won by less than a single percentage point. It is the more conservative district in the state, which leans Democratic in most races. Maine backed Harris by about seven points in 2024 and had never allocated its statewide votes to Trump. Golden and six other Democrats voted to pass the DHS spending measure on Thursday. Representative Jared Golden, a Maine Democrat, attends an event in Lewiston, Maine, on October 25, 2024. What People Are Saying Journalist Jonathan Cohn wrote on X on Thursday: “Jared Golden isn't running again. He has no need to pander to Trump voters in his final days in office. He's just a bad person who wants bad things.” Maine Governor Janet Mills, a Democrat, wrote in a statement on Thursday: “I recognize that many people across Maine are fearful in the wake of ICE’s announcement that it has launched an operation in Maine, and my Administration remains in close contact with municipal officials, including in Lewiston and Portland, as well as with organizations across Maine, to monitor ICE activity and ensure the safety and civil rights of people across Maine are protected. If the Federal government has warrants, then it should show them. But if they are separating working mothers from young children, solely because they sought freedom here and have committed no crime, then the Federal government is only sowing intimidation and fear and fostering division and suspicion among neighbors – none of which is welcome.” Senator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, wrote in a statement earlier this week: “Immigrants have long been an important part of our state, and they continue to make valuable contributions to our communities. People who are in this country legally should not be targets of ICE investigations. They should be able to continue to go to work, school, and other public places and carry on with their normal lives. If for some reason an individual who is here legally is improperly detained, they should seek assistance through advocacy networks and the legal system. There are people in Maine and elsewhere who have entered this country illegally and who have engaged in criminal activity. They could be subject to arrest and deportation pursuant to the laws of the United States, and people who are exercising the right to peacefully gather and protest their government should be careful not to interfere with law enforcement efforts while doing so.” What Happens Next Heightened immigration enforcement continues in Maine and across the country. Golden, meanwhile, has said he is not running for reelection this year, leaving open a seat in a district Trump carried in each of his three presidential bids.","summary":"Representative Jared Golden said operations in Maine may serve “the public interest.”","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jared-golden-maine-democrat-tells-people-stop-interfering-ice-operations-11408658","image":"https://assets.newsweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP25309737816136.jpg?w=1600&h=900&q=88","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 17:28:11","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.07},{"id":395511544,"title":"Jack Smith on Trump accusations that Biden directed probes: ‘No’","text":"Long before and after his return to the White House, President Donald Trump perennially linked Joe Biden with John L. “Jack” Smith, the Justice Department special counsel who brought criminal charges against him.\n\nBut when Smith testified publicly for the first time Thursday, it was Democrats who repeatedly raised the issue to emphasize a lack of proof that Smith’s cases were driven by pressure from Biden.\n\nThe president in social media posts called Smith a “Biden Prosecutor” and “Joe Biden’s Prosecutorial Thug.” Smith was a henchman and Biden his boss, Trump said. And he declared, falsely, that Smith was appointed by the Democratic president.\n\n“He works for Kamala and he works for Joe,” Trump said in a NewsNation interview about a month before the 2024 presidential election.\n\nSmith, testifying under oath Thursday, rebuffed claims that Biden was calling the shots from behind the scenes.\n\n“Did President Biden or anyone in the Biden White House ever direct you to seek retribution against anyone perceived to be Biden’s political opponent?” Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., asked.\n\n“No,” Smith responded.\n\nLieu contrasted that approach to the Justice Department under the second Trump administration, referencing a Trump-directed criminal case against New York Attorney General Letitia James, which was subsequently dismissed by a district court.\n\nRep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., asked about the approach from Merrick B. Garland, the former attorney general who appointed Smith. “Did Attorney General Merrick Garland direct you to prosecute Trump because Donald Trump was running against Joe Biden in the presidential election?” Johnson asked.\n\n“No,” Smith said.\n\nRep. Steve Cohen also asked if there was pressure from Biden or former Vice President Kamala Harris to bring an indictment.\n\n“I was given the independence to conduct my investigation, and I came to the decision to bring charges in this case without undue influence from anybody in the department,” Smith replied.\n\nFor their part, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee largely steered clear of the president’s claims. Instead, they focused on legal issues that were peripheral to the special counsel’s conclusions, such as whether it was appropriate to seek phone records from Republican lawmakers.\n\nRep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., most sharply questioned Smith about political motivations for his actions — but more directed at the phone records issue.\n\n“They sure as hell were Joe Biden’s political enemies, weren’t they? They were Harris’ political enemies. They were the enemies of the president, and you were their arm, weren’t you?” Issa said.\n\n“No,” Smith responded.\n\nSmith’s testimony was also in line with comments he made last month during a lengthy closed-door interview in which he defended the criminal cases and rejected long-standing Republican criticisms that his investigation was driven by partisan politics.\n\nSmith said he never spoke with Biden about the investigations and the Democratic president never gave him any instructions about what to do in those cases.\n\n“I would never take orders from a political leader to hamper another person in an election. That’s not who I am. And I think people who know me and my experience over 30 years would find that laughable,” Smith said, according to a transcript of the interview.\n\nSmith’s special counsel office brought two criminal cases against Trump: one in Washington tied to Trump’s attempt to overturn the 2020 election and another in Florida that accused Trump of illegally retaining classified documents after his first term.\n\nSmith moved to dismiss both cases after the election and before the inauguration, citing internal Justice Department opinions that the Constitution prohibits a federal indictment and prosecution of a sitting president.\n\nRep. Mary Gay Scanlon, D-Pa., a member of the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview there’s been no evidence that the special counsel prosecutions were driven or directed by Biden or his White House. \n\n“Smith’s reputation is and always has been that he’s a total straight-arrow career prosecutor,” she said.","url":"https://rollcall.com/2026/01/23/jack-smith-on-trump-accusations-that-biden-directed-probes-no/","image":"https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2026/01/smith_judiciary_225_012226.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 17:19:40","author":"Posted January 23, 2026 At 5:19pm","authors":["Posted January 23, 2026 At 5:19pm"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.287},{"id":395427166,"title":"Fury grows over 5-year-old’s detention in US immigration crackdown","text":"Outrage grew on Friday over the detention of a five-year-old boy in a massive immigration crackdown in Minneapolis, as US Vice President JD Vance defended the roundups by federal agents, prompting calls for a general strike.\n\nThe superintendent of Columbia Heights Public Schools, where Ramos was a pre-school student, said the child and his Ecuadoran father, Adrian Conejo Arias, who were asylum seekers were taken from their driveway as they arrived home.\n\nRamos was then used as “bait” by immigration officers to knock on the door of his home to draw out those inside, Zena Stenvik added.\n\nThousands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents have been deployed to the Democratic-led city, as US President Donald Trump presses his campaign to deport illegal immigrants across the country.\n\nVance confirmed on Thursday that the five-year-old boy, Liam Conejo Ramos, was among those detained, but argued that agents were protecting him after his father “ran” from an immigration sweep.\n\n“What are they supposed to do?

Even taking Carr at his word that certain shows are hopelessly partisan, that hardly justifies using government power to change them. Besides, Carr seems to relish his reputation as President Donald Trump's \"media attack dog\"—when he's the one in charge, should we really trust his agency to assess whether The View has enough conservative guests on?\n\nIn fact, the argument that broadcasters must be tightly regulated to give Americans access to a broad range of information makes little sense these days. When the equal-time rule originated in the 1930s, it applied to radio, and for much of its subsequent history, the three broadcast networks were the only TV channels. The average household now has access to hundreds of cable channels, not to mention streaming services, YouTube, and social media—none of which are subject to the FCC's heavy hand.\n\nCarr threatens network daytime and late-night shows with reprisal if they don't offer candidates equal time. But Fox News' late-night show Gutfeld!, which draws more viewers than any of the networks, can have on any guests it wants, since the content of cable TV generally falls outside the FCC's purview. The same goes for social media platforms like TikTok, where 1 in 5 Americans regularly gets their news. The idea that ABC, NBC, and CBS control the flow of information is quaint.\n\nBroadcast networks have been losing viewers for years. \"Streaming represented 44.8% of TV viewership in May 2025,\" Nielsen found in June 2025, \"while broadcast (20.1%) and cable (24.1%) combined to represent 44.2% of TV.\" In other words, 80 percent of all that we watch on TV is not even subject to the same level of FCC regulation, including the equal-time rule.\n\nThe decline of broadcast doesn't mean Carr's memo is insignificant. In fact, it could lead to onerous governmental nitpicking of the sort that has already been a trademark of Carr's time heading the FCC.\n\nIn September 2025, ABC briefly pulled Jimmy Kimmel's late-night show after Carr threatened FCC action, stemming from his interpretation of a joke in Kimmel's monologue that mentioned the death of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Right away, Carr gloated about Kimmel's suspension and suggested daytime talk show The View could be his next target.\n\n\"I would assume you could make the argument that The View is a bona fide news program,\" he told conservative commentator Scott Jennings. \"But I am not so sure about that, and I think it is worthwhile to have the FCC look into whether The View and some of these other programs that you have still qualify as bona fide news programs.\"\n\nIt seems he got his answer. \"The FCC has not been presented with any evidence that the interview portion of any late night or daytime television talk show program on air presently would qualify for the bona fide news exemption,\" Carr's memo argues. \"Moreover, a program that is motivated by partisan purposes, for example, would not be entitled to an exemption under longstanding FCC precedent.\"\n\nOf course, assessing \"partisan purposes\" is a very subjective task, and Carr has proven eager to use government power against his political opponents.\n\nCarr complained when then–Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, briefly appeared on NBC's Saturday Night Live days before the 2024 election. He accused NBC of \"biased and partisan conduct\" and \"evad[ing] the FCC's Equal Time rule.\" And when Trump filed a bogus lawsuit baselessly accusing CBS of maliciously editing its preelection interview with Harris on 60 Minutes, Carr held up parent company Paramount's pending merger until it agreed to settle the lawsuit and institute \"significant changes\" in how its news division operated.\n\nCarr \"sees correcting anti-Trump bias as an important part of his job,\" Jacob Sullum wrote in the February/March issue of Reason, in a piece about the FCC's history of policing speech. \"In fact, Carr seems eager to embrace what he once derided as 'a roving mandate to police speech in the name of the \"public interest.\"'\"\n\nThe equal-time rule is an antiquated regulation that becomes more obsolete with each passing year. It's no longer the case that broadcast networks are Americans' only—or even main—source of information. It shouldn't be up to the FCC to decide if talk shows are the right amount of partisan. If viewers don't want to watch, it's easier than ever to just watch something else.","summary":"The equal-time rule is an antiquated regulation that becomes more obsolete with each passing year.","url":"https://reason.com/2026/01/23/the-fcc-wants-to-police-how-many-conservatives-appear-on-the-view/","image":"https://reason.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brendan-carr-the-view-fcc-public-notice-1200x675.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 16:55:32","author":"Joe Lancaster","authors":["Joe Lancaster"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.207},{"id":395435094,"title":"ICE Went Above and Beyond to Comfort Abandoned 5-Year-Old After Mother Refused to Take Custody","text":"Democrats are having dramatic, hysterical meltdowns about a five-year-old whom they say Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arrested.

Good on these ICE agents! 👏🏻 pic.twitter.com/tBBBPnc3T2— Eric Daugherty (@EricLDaugh) January 23, 2026\n\nTo crown the whole affair, not only did the criminal father abandon his son, but the child’s mother refused to take custody of him when ICE tried to reunite them, according to a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official on Newsmax. So the family to whom Democrats issued so many messages of empathy treated their own child in the most despicable way possible, leaving him in the hands of ICE officers. That poor child is caught in a nightmare thanks to the horrible decision-making and heartless indifference of the adults who should care for him the most.\n\nThe real story of the incident that caused all this furor, per ICE, is: “On January 20, ICE conducted a targeted operation to arrest Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias an illegal alien from Ecuador who was RELEASED into the U.S. by the Biden administration. As agents approached the driver Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, fled on foot — abandoning his child. For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias.”\n\nRelated: The Despicable Lie That ICE Arrested an Abandoned Child\n\nAs for what followed, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told Newsmax that the five-year-old’s mother “would not take the child into custody, which is so sad, so horrific.”\n\nShe continued, “Our law enforcement officers were actually taking care of the child, took him to McDonald’s, were playing his favorite music to really calm him down.” McLaughlin said that “major riots” are threatening federal immigration officers now as Democrats do everything they can to push the lie that ICE cruelly kidnapped the boy. Despite the fact that the father abandoned his child, DHS did reunite the two in a processing facility, since the mother would not take charge of the boy.

The report details barring news outlets from events, lawsuits against media organizations, public targeting of journalists, and the implementation of restrictive press guidelines.\n\nExperts point to a deliberate strategy to reshape the relationship between government and the press, drawing parallels to authoritarian regimes. There are concerns about the long-term consequences for human rights and the erosion of democratic institutions.\n\nThose who describe the first year of Donald Trump’s second term as a series of personal skirmishes with “difficult” or “hostile” journalists miss the bigger picture. As Tom Jones of the Poynter Institute has written, this is not about isolated incidents but about a structural attack on the press as a democratic institution.\n\nConsider the Associated Press, one of the most authoritative news agencies in the world. AP was barred from White House events because it continued to refer to the Gulf of Mexico rather than adopting Trump’s ideologically motivated renaming of it as the “Gulf of America.” This was not a misunderstanding or a slip of the tongue, but an explicit sanction for an editorial decision.\n\nTrump and his administration have meanwhile filed lawsuits—or threatened to do so—against CBS News, The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, the BBC and other news organisations. ABC News reportedly paid around $14 million to settle a case; CBS News followed with a settlement estimated at $16 million related to the editing of an interview with Kamala Harris. Legal experts widely described these claims as weak, but media owners opted to settle rather than litigate, often fearing that refusing to do so would provoke presidential retaliation.\n\nAlongside this legal pressure, Trump continued to target individual journalists publicly. On 14 November he snapped “Quiet, piggy” at Bloomberg reporter Catherine Lucey. Four days later he called ABC News journalist Mary Bruce “a terrible person and a terrible reporter.” Entire newsrooms were repeatedly branded “enemies of the people,” “sick,” or simply “fake news.” Critical reporting is systematically framed by the president as malicious opposition.\n\nCrucially, analysts stress that this is not improvisation. According to press-freedom organisations and journalists at Poynter, Trump is following the blueprint laid out in Project 2025: an ideological plan to fundamentally reshape the relationship between government and the press. The steps are familiar—restrict access to officials, redefine who qualifies as a journalist, politicise regulatory bodies, and cut public funding. Media organisations that depend on federal support—NPR, PBS and outlets under the U.S. Agency for Global Media—have been hit hardest.\n\nIn October 2025 this strategy became starkly visible at the Pentagon. New press guidelines were introduced that effectively made independent reporting impossible. Access was tied to conditions that media organisations, Amnesty International and press-freedom groups said undermined normal journalistic practice and eroded protections for confidential sources.\n\nAlmost the entire mainstream press—including AP, Reuters, NPR and all major newspapers and broadcasters—refused to accept these conditions and collectively surrendered their press credentials. The vacated places were filled by pro-Trump outlets and political “influencers.” Critical journalism was not formally banned—but it was rendered unworkable. This is a familiar technique in countries where democratic institutions are hollowed out from within.\n\nSome fear a similar scenario may soon unfold at the White House itself, where critical questions are increasingly unwelcome. Last week, Belfast-born journalist Niall Stanage was publicly berated by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt—an incident that many reporters see as a warning sign.\n\nThe pressure has not been limited to rhetoric, lawsuits or access restrictions. In recent weeks, a line was crossed that until recently seemed unthinkable in the United States: a search of a journalist’s home. Hannah Natanson, an investigative reporter for The Washington Post, was visited by federal investigators as part of a leak investigation. Her home was searched and her laptops were seized.\n\nThis was made possible by a broader reinterpretation of national-security legislation, an explicit weakening of source-protection safeguards, and expanded discretion for the Department of Justice to treat journalists as “accomplices” to leaks. Long-standing guidelines dating back to Watergate—under which searches of journalists were allowed only as a last resort—have been revised or set aside.\n\nPress-freedom organisations warned of a “tremendous intrusion” and a profound “chilling effect.” Even if the case against Natanson ultimately collapses, the signal is unmistakable: journalists who expose abuses of power or publish internal documents risk not only legal intimidation but direct intrusion into their private lives. The protection of sources—a cornerstone of investigative journalism—is now under direct threat.\n\nAs PEN America’s journalism leadership has noted, this is behaviour we associate with authoritarian police states, not with democratic societies that recognise the essential role of journalism in informing the public.\n\nAmnesty International now argues that this is no longer merely a media dispute, but a full-blown human-rights crisis. Paul O’Brien, executive director of Amnesty International USA, has warned that by tearing up norms and concentrating power, the administration is attempting to make accountability impossible. There is, he says, no doubt that these authoritarian practices undermine human rights and increase risks not only for journalists, but also for protesters, lawyers, students and human-rights defenders.\n\nAmnesty identifies twelve interconnected domains in which the foundations of a free society are being eroded. Attacks on press freedom and access to information lie at the centre. The organisation documents intimidation of journalists, restrictions on access, delegitimisation of media and the politicisation of regulatory bodies. The consequences extend well beyond the United States. The dismantling of Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and Radio Martí weakens independent reporting in regions where press freedom is already fragile.\n\nInternational press-freedom rankings confirm that this is not a matter of perception. Reporters Without Borders has recorded a marked decline for the United States on the World Press Freedom Index, citing political pressure, legal intimidation and the politicisation of access to information. The organisation draws a stark conclusion: Trump promised after his re-election to be a “dictator on day one,” and with regard to the press, that promise has largely been fulfilled. In just one year, government data have been censored, public broadcasters dismantled, independent agencies politicised, media intimidated through the courts, and international support for press freedom withdrawn. RSF explicitly compares this approach to that of leaders such as Vladimir Putin.\n\nAs RSF’s Clayton Weimers observes, individual attacks disappear in the daily news cycle—but taken together, the conclusion is unavoidable: the American president is waging a systematic war on the free press, with consequences that extend far beyond the United States.\n\nWriting recently in The New York Times, journalist and author Masha Gessen captured the moment succinctly: “We still have independent media. But when we take stock of how much the media landscape has changed, it is sobering.”\n\nGessen ends with a warning—and a call to action. “Of course, the United States is not Russia — or Hungary or Venezuela or Israel or any of the many other democracies that have turned or are turning themselves into autocracies. But now is the time to focus on the similarities and try to learn from the ways other countries have cracked down on protest, eviscerated their electoral systems, limited their media freedom and built concentration camps. The only way to keep the space from imploding is to fill it, to prop up the walls: to claim all the room there still is for speaking, writing, publishing, protesting, voting. It’s what the people of Minnesota appear to be doing, and it’s something each of us needs to do — right now, while we still can.”","summary":"A new report analyzes the first year of Donald Trump&#8217;s second term, highlighting a systematic attack on press freedom.

That was the question facing disgraced former special prosecutor Jack Smith. Either way, he was in a tough spot.\n\nIf he chose the former, as so many of his underlings had already done, he’d lend support to the suggestion that he’s a coward and a zealot. But if he chose the latter, he’d remove all doubt.\n\nJack Smith did indeed testify yesterday, for nearly five hours before the House Judiciary Committee, and he lived down to all my expectations. “I will not be intimidated,” he harrumphed.\n\nSmith, of course, is the unconstitutional former special counsel whom Joe Biden’s embittered hatchet man of an attorney general, Merrick Garland, handpicked to persecute Donald Trump for having had the audacity to question the results of the rigged 2020 election — you remember, the one in which basement-bound Biden got more population-adjusted votes than rock-star Barack Obama got in 2008. As Smith put it, Trump “sought to prey” on his supporters, “looked for ways to stay in power,” and was responsible for the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol. That was the day when Trump stood on the Ellipse just south of the White House and said, “I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.”\n\nSo desperate was Smith to get Trump that he slapped a gag order on him, dispatched the FBI to barge into the former and future president’s Mar-a-Lago estate and start sniffing around in the first lady’s underwear drawer, and put together a Nixonian enemies list of Trump-supporting Republican lawmakers and snatched up their phone records while ordering the phone carriers not to alert the victims of Smith’s spying.\n\n“It was always about politics,” said House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan. “The good news is, the American people saw through it.” They certainly did see through this and other forms of Democrat lawfare, and they rejected it at the ballot box by resoundingly returning Donald Trump to the White House.\n\nThere were many compelling moments from yesterday’s events. Perhaps my favorite was how the cat got Smith’s tongue during California Republican Kevin Kiley’s questioning. Kiley brought up an assessment by constitutional law professor Jonathan Turley that Smith had overstepped his constitutional bounds, and Smith responded by saying that he disagreed with Turley’s characterization. Then Kiley brought up the 9-0 Supreme Court ruling in which the justices unanimously struck down Smith’s tactics in securing a corruption conviction against former Republican Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell, and asked him if he also disagreed with justices Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Silence.\n\nIt was leftist lawfare on the hot seat, and California Congressman Darrell Issa made sure everyone knew it. In front of a large backdrop titled “Biden DOJ Enemies List,” which included the pro-Trump Republicans whom Smith had spied on, Issa charged: “You, like the president’s men for Richard Nixon, went after your political enemies. … They’re not your political enemies, but they sure as hell were Joe Biden’s political enemies, weren’t they? They were [Kamala] Harris’s political enemies. They were the enemies of the president, and you were their arm.”\n\nIssa ended his interrogation of Smith with these words: “And with that, I yield back in disgust of this witness.”\n\nFor the Trump haters, there was Democrat ranking member Jamie Raskin, who extolled Smith’s imaginary virtues and laughably said, “You did everything right.”\n\nWhenever I hear garbage like this, I remind myself that God protected Donald Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania — and that He did so in a way that was obvious to everyone.\n\nWas Trump tuned in to yesterday’s proceedings? You bet. He posted on Truth Social that Smith was being “DECIMATED” and calling him a “deranged animal, who shouldn’t be allowed to practice Law.”\n\nAs Fox News funnyman Greg Gutfeld often says, only half-jokingly: We don’t deserve him.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/articles/124488-hatchet-jack-defends-himself-2026-01-23","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01KFNTVSFAXJWQVRPTQH73Z6S1.jpeg?w=1200&h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 16:41:42","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.251},{"id":395435600,"title":"Nolte: Treasury Sec. Bessent Says Gavin Newsom Is ‘in over His Hairdo’","text":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent continued his hilariously accurate attacks on Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) Thursday by pointing out that the failed governor is “in over his hairdo.”\n\nTalking with the far-left Politico, Bessent said, “I think Gavin Newsom may be cracking up, some of these things he’s saying. I think he may be in over his hairdo.”\n\nThe man who may some day be America’s second gay president also responded to Newsom’s comparing Trump to a dinosaur. “To say strange things like President Trump is a tyrannosaurus rex, what the hell does that mean? I can say Gavin Newsom is a brontosaurus with a brain the size of a walnut.”\n\nAbout Newsom walking around the World Economic Forum (WEF) with kneepads to shame world leaders who dare to work with the elected President of the United States, Bessent said, “And, if you brought the knee pads, maybe that was for his meeting with Alex Soros.”\n\nBy the way, how was Newsom not violating the Logan Act with this…?\n\nUpon arriving, Newsom urged European leaders not to cave to Trump’s demands over a wide-range [sic] of foreign policy issues. In a panel at the conference, the California governor brandished a pair of kneepads bearing Trump’s signature to mock world leaders he feels have been overly accommodating of the president.\n\nNo one, except the President of the United States, should be attempting to influence foreign policy. What Newsom engaged in here was nothing short of treason in my opinion. Actively attempting to undermine American foreign policy is treason. I get why the Trump Administration is choosing ridicule over outrage: It’s more effective, but still…\n\nThis was not the first time Bessent tore into Newsom at this week’s WEF. During his speech the day before, the Treasury Secretary shamed the failed governor.\n\n“Very, very ironic that Governor Newsom, who strikes me as Patrick Bateman meets Sparkle Beach Ken, may be the only Californian who knows less about economics than Kamala Harris,” Bessent said.\n\n“He’s here this week with his billionaire sugar daddy, Alex Soros,” he added. “And Davos is a perfect place for a man who when everyone else was on lockdown, when he was having people arrested for going to church, he was having $1,000 a night meals at the French Laundry.”\n\nThen Bessent went for the killshot: “He is here hobnobbing with the global elite while his California citizens are still homeless. Shame on him.”\n\nRidicule is one of the most effective political tools out there. When you turn your opponent into a joke, it undermines the way the public looks at them; you take away the ability to see this person as a leader. But the joke has to stick, and in order to stick, it has to be based on a basic truth. Every attempt to ridicule Trump into a joke has failed because the ridicule was always based on a lie. And anything that does stick only makes him relatable (fast food, speaking style, etc.).\n\nGavin Newsom is Sparkle Beach Ken, his economic record is a disaster, and he did party with elites while arresting people for going to church.\n\nIf Newsom is the Democrat Party’s great, white, male hope, I like our chances because Vice President JD Vance will feast on this failed phony.\n\nJohn Nolte’s first and last novel, Borrowed Time, is winning five-star raves from everyday readers.

The report, which analyzed crime stats from 40 cities, noted that 11 of 13 crime categories saw a decline. Nine categories saw decreases of 10% or greater, and homicides dropped 21%. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt highlighted the lowest homicide rate since 1900, concluding, “This is what happens when you have a President who fully mobilizes federal law enforcement to arrest violent criminals and the worst of the worst illegal aliens.” The city with the largest drop in homicides was Denver, which reported a 41% decline, followed by Washington, DC, and Omaha, both with 40% declines. Overall, violent crime dropped to its lowest level since 2019, and car theft dropped by 27%.\nWarrantless ICE entrees? Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit legal organization, circulated an ICE memo obtained from two unnamed government officials to Congress, and Democrat Sen. Richard Blumenthal has now released it to the public. The memo, signed by Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons, instructs ICE agents on methods to enter the homes of illegal immigrants using only a Form I-205 “administrative warrant.” The whistleblowers and Blumenthal decry this action, as administrative warrants have typically only been used to arrest illegal immigrants in public places. Form I-205 differs from a judicial warrant in that it is signed by an ICE officer and relies on a prior final removal order issued by a judge. Typical judicial warrants to forcibly enter a home require a neutral magistrate’s signature. Although in today’s political climate, neutral magistrates may be an extinct species.\nHouse passes last four funding bills: On Thursday, the House passed its final funding bills for 2026, as three minibus bills were packaged and passed by a vote of 341-88. These bills provide funding for the War Department, HUD, HHS, Transportation, Labor, and Education. The bill funding DHS was also passed by a vote of 220-207, despite opposition raised by Democrat leaders, who sought to politicize the death of anti-ICE agitator Renee Good over their opposition to the Trump administration’s immigration enforcement. Speaker Mike Johnson praised the House’s progress and attributed it to “returning the appropriations process to a committee-led, member-driven approach, as it should be.” The funding bills now head to the Senate, where they are expected to be taken up prior to the January 30 deadline.\nTrump sues JPMorgan for $5 billion: In the wake of the protest-turned-riot on January 6, 2021, a bevy of institutions took action to silence the 45th president. Shortly after he left office, Donald Trump and his organization were informed that JPMorgan Chase had made the “final and unequivocal” decision to close his accounts, giving him just weeks to find an alternative. The lawsuit alleges that JPMC’s decision was because “the political tide at the moment favored doing so.” The bank argues that its commitment to following the letter and the spirit of the law left it no choice but to debank the former president against its own wishes. Somehow, the largest banking institution in America arguing that its hands were tied and that it had no alternative but to take unilateral action of a kind never seen before, without taking the issue to court, just doesn’t ring true.\nSayonara, WHO: The Trump administration officially withdrew the U.S. from the World Health Organization yesterday, ending its 78-year membership with the UN’s health agency. The White House pointed to the WHO’s mishandling of the COVID pandemic and subsequent “failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence” from the likes of China as the reason for this action. The fact of the matter is that, like much of the UN, the WHO has become little other than an organization that exists to push increasingly radical leftist ideology under the guise of “healthcare” and “science.” It’s a globalist front organization, and it’s about time America reclaimed a bit of sovereignty and left.\nThe TikTok deal: All those leftists who use TikTok can thank President Trump for saving it, but they won’t. After a year of extensions on the complete ban, a deal has been reached for a group of investors that includes the American tech giant Oracle, the California-based private equity fund Silver Lake, and the United Arab Emirates investment firm MGX, with ByteDance keeping a 19.9% stake in the U.S. operation. Trump’s fourth extension was going to end today, so the deal came in the nick of time. The New York Times cried foul because several of the investors have ties to Trump, but the real concern is whether China still controls the algorithms and data. The deal did not transfer the company’s algorithm to the new enterprise; rather, ByteDance is licensing it to the U.S. TikTok. Who controls the propaganda machine remains to be seen.\nNo more funding for research via fetal tissue: Donald Trump, the self-described “most pro-life president ever,” sometimes needs reminding of that fact, but not this time. The National Institutes of Health on Thursday ended federal funding for any research that uses tissue from aborted babies. This win prevents the sale of aborted babies to labs for research into areas like stem cells, but NIH Director Jay Bhattacharya stressed that parents who suffer miscarriages can still donate the baby’s body to science. Abortion is the moral issue of our time, and widespread adoption of the abortion pill has led to an explosion of problems, but decisions like this from the NIH that get between abortionists and a paycheck are a step in the right direction.\nNick Shirley eyes California: The upstart journalist who exposed the “Quality Learing Center” in Minnesota is turning his attention to California. His path is not easy. Nick Shirley’s home has been doxed, and his family has received calls from the public, forcing him to hire 24-hour security. Undeterred, Shirley has said he will pursue fraud cases in California to discover the truth. He specifically mentioned California’s high-speed rail project, which has been ongoing for decades and has produced no visible results so far. Earlier this year, First Assistant U.S. Attorney for the Central District of California Bill Essayli launched an investigation into the $24 billion the state had spent over the last five years to combat homelessness, an amount “no one can account for.” Blue states, it seems, provide fraud investigators like Shirley fertile ground with which to work.\nTPUSA sends cease-and-desist to Candace: She has been asking for it for months, and it finally happened: podcaster Candace Owens received a cease-and-desist letter from Turning Point USA. The final warning implores Owens to stop her ongoing smear campaign since the assassination of TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk, wherein she has been spinning increasingly outlandish and false conspiracies blaming members of TPUSA and even Charlie’s wife, Erika, for “somehow” being involved in his murder. An increasingly unhinged Owens responded to the letter by insisting that it was more “evidence” proving her wild conspiracy claims and then claimed, “Get your lawyer to send a cease-and-desist to the sun, and you will have better luck getting it to stop than getting me to look away from what happened to Charlie. That’s how I feel, uhkay?” Looks like Owens will soon be facing a lawsuit.\n\nTrump revokes Canada’s spot on “Board of Peace” following Davos remarks (Fox News)\nJudge bars FBI from reviewing seized Washington Post reporter’s electronics (Washington Examiner)\nTrump aims to topple Cuba’s communist regime by the end of the year: report (NY Post)\nThe Chinese spy machine infiltrating Taiwan’s military (WSJ)\nSatire: Minnesota arrests churchgoers for interrupting protest (Babylon Bee)\n\nThe Executive News Summary is compiled daily by Jordan Candler, Thomas Gallatin, Sterling Henry, and Sophie Starkova.

Why? Because Leftmedia hysteria over the actions and tactics of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement helps Democrats and hurts the Bad Orange Man.\n\nThere are so many news ICEicles out there today, but I want to use those to better view the big picture, which is the Left’s tireless work to discredit everything President Donald Trump and his administration do. They don’t want to clean up ICE enforcement. They want to end ICE enforcement. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris opened the border, creating a humanitarian crisis, and now leftists say the real problem is cleaning up that mess.\n\nI’ll start with pollaganda — the use of polls to steer rather than reflect public opinion. In the wake of what I think was the justifiable shooting death of Renee Good, numerous media outlets are blaring headlines to say something along the lines of “Americans think ICE is going too far.” Yes, I’m sorry Good is dead. But the Leftmedia coverage of it has not been fair or honest, and emotion, not evidence, is dictating much of the public’s response.\n\nThat said, our Mark Alexander rightly warned in early December that ICE already had an optics problem — and that was before Good’s death or a whistleblower’s claim that an ICE policy allows agents to enter the home of a suspected illegal alien without a warrant. If true, that’s a significant problem, though I’m reserving judgment because of the left-wing operation to discredit ICE.\n\nRegardless of the truth or the Left’s lawless motivations, leftist agitators are successfully turning the public against ICE.\n\nThe latest example came yesterday. “ICE just detained a 5-year-old child,” Representative Ilhan Omar (D-Somalia) railed on X. “Don’t tell us this is about ‘the worst of the worst.’ That’s a lie. Absolutely vile.”\n\nWhat a missed opportunity for Omar to plug one of those Somali daycares her Minneapolis constituents run. I hear there are lots of openings.\n\nSarcasm aside, the Department of Homeland Security says Omar is lying: “As agents approached … Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, [he] fled on foot — abandoning his child. For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias.”\n\nThat’s why both are in ICE custody, now in Texas. Leftists scream if children are separated from their parents, and they scream if a child is detained with his father. That’s because they’re screaming about enforcing immigration law, not about children. They certainly don’t raise much of a complaint about the human traffickers who abuse migrant children; only ICE receives their ire — for apprehending child sex offenders!\n\n“Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children,” DHS added, “or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administrations’ immigration enforcement.” Furthermore, “Parents can take control of their departure and receive a free flight and $2,600 with the CBP Home app.”\n\nOfficials at the boy’s school claim that he was used “as bait” to lure his father out of his house. The Leftmedia bewails the “abhorrent” viral photo of the boy, though it looks totally innocuous to me.\n\nVice President JD Vance traveled to Minneapolis yesterday to address the broader situation and “bring down the temperature.” How did USA Today headline it? “Vice President Vance defends ICE detainment of 5-year-old in Minnesota.”\n\nThat was only one small part of Vance’s comments and purposes, but he did note, “If the argument is that you can’t arrest people who have violated the law because they have children, then every single parent is going to be completely given immunity from ever being the subject of law enforcement.”\n\nThat’s a fair point, but Conejo Arias’s attorney says, “These are not illegal aliens. They came properly and are pursuing a legal pathway.” That will need to be sorted out.\n\nVance also knew where to point a finger, saying, “Frankly, a lot of the media is lying about the job that [ICE agents] do every single day.”\n\nAs for the overall situation in Minnesota, Vance’s message was simple. Before he arrived, he said, “If you want to turn down the chaos in Minneapolis, stop fighting immigration enforcement and accept that we have to have a border in this country. It’s not that hard.” While there, he added, “The directive that I got from the president of the United States is ‘Meet these guys halfway.’ Work with them so that we can make these immigration enforcement operations successful without endangering our ICE officers, and so that we could turn down the chaos a little bit, at least. I think a lot, actually.”\n\nDemocrat Governor Tim Walz responded that he was “glad the Vice President agrees the temperature needs to be turned down, but actions speak louder than words.” His solution? “Take the show of force off the streets.”\n\nWhy is there a show of force? Because Minnesota is a sanctuary state where state and local officials don’t cooperate with federal officers. Why were Walz, state Attorney General Keith Ellison, and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey served with Justice Department subpoenas on Tuesday? For alleged conspiracy to obstruct federal law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, some anti-ICE activists who stormed that church service on Sunday found out that doing so is a crime.\n\n“We have arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, who allegedly played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,” announced Attorney General Pam Bondi. Later, she added, “A second arrest has been made at my direction. Chauntyll Louisa Allen has been taken into custody.”\n\nGiven that the anti-ICE agitators filmed themselves violating the FACE Act, it’s hard to argue with the arrests. Armstrong tried, however, telling CNN, “We did not rush into that church. We actually went and sat down and participated in the service.” Is that what you call it?\n\nFormer CNN personality Don Lemon, who entered the church with the protesters and live-streamed their intimidating service interruption — definitely only for the sake of journalism! (wink, wink) — has not been arrested. Never mind, I guess, that Lemon is on video announcing his disruptive intent, noting that Armstrong began her agitating work after George Floyd’s death.\n\nLemon’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell of Hunter Biden infamy, says the DOJ is engaged in a “stunning and troubling effort to silence and punish a journalist.” A magistrate judge rejected charges against Lemon. That judge, by the way, is connected to the anti-ICE Democrat machine, which seems like a conflict of interest. According to Fox News’s Bill Melugin, “Multiple sources tell me & colleague [David Spunt] that the federal magistrate in Minnesota who refused to sign off on an arrest warrant for Don Lemon is Douglas L. Micko and that his wife works as an Assistant Attorney General in Minnesota AG Keith Ellison’s office.”\n\nWhew, that’s a lot of news, but again, there’s a big picture.\n\nDemocrats, their Leftmedia propagandists, and their horde of left-wing agitators have a singular strategy: Discredit ICE and Trump by creating and filming confrontations with federal agents. Never mind that a lot of migrant criminals are in our nation illegally. Never mind that many of those criminals have victimized American citizens. Never mind the Rule of Law.

Even though Roe v. Wade has been overturned, this annual march still represents the seminal battle for the complete eradication of abortion in every state. It also raises awareness about other life-related issues like IVF and assisted suicide.\n\nVice President JD Vance is headlining today’s event, which is wonderful. He is more genuinely pro-life than President Donald Trump, with the added bonus that he and Second Lady Usha Vance are expecting their fourth child in July.\n\nHowever, one could reasonably argue that this year’s March for Life is especially important.\n\nIn the lead-up to his victory in November 2024 and throughout his second term, Donald Trump has been shaky on pro-life issues. His campaign advisers evidently convinced him that the Dobbs v. Jackson ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade and sent the issue back to the states could hurt him in the election. It did not.\n\nAs the editors of National Review point out, “Trump’s decisive election victory, after Kamala Harris bet heavily on the abortion issue, showed that it was not the third rail that some pundits predicted after Dobbs.”\n\nHowever, Trump has continued to act like this is a losing issue for the Republicans. He recently asked us to be flexible on the Hyde Amendment in attempting to solve the expanded ObamaCare subsidy tug of war. The Hyde Amendment doesn’t ban abortion, but it does stop federal dollars from funding it except in the cases of rape or incest.\n\nPresident Trump is also very supportive of in vitro fertilization (IVF), which is a can of ethical worms in and of itself.\n\nFinally, his administration has been slow to walk back the extremism of the Joe Biden era. Under President Biden, the abortion pill was approved to be sent to women who haven’t even visited a doctor. Some have died as a result. The Trump administration has yet to rein that in. The Food and Drug Administration promised to look into the harmful side effects of the abortion pill to mothers, but those findings have yet to be released.\n\nTo be fair, there have been plenty of pro-life wins from this administration. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act took away Medicaid funds from Planned Parenthood for one year. While this is hardly much, it’s still a win.\n\nPresident Trump also pardoned those who were imprisoned by Biden’s excessive interpretation of the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) Act.\n\nAnd this week, the administration announced that the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is no longer using aborted baby parts for its scientific experiments. According to The Daily Wire, “That policy will apply to all NIH grants, cooperative agreements, transaction awards, research and development contracts, and the NIH Intramural Research Program.” This new policy is a significant win for the pro-life cause.\n\nPolitically, the pro-life movement is at a crossroads. This was made clear by The Lamp managing editor Nic Rowan, who wrote in The Wall Street Journal:\n\nThe president’s support for pro-life positions is provisional. If he believes he needs pro-life votes to win an election, he modifies his views to approximate those of the movement. If he believes he can get by without opposing abortion, he mutes his support. Pro-lifers have to show he needs them to win.\n\nThey convinced him in 2016. The president repaid them with three originalist Supreme Court justices. These justices were all in the majority of the Dobbs decision, which in 2022 overturned the high court’s decision in Roe v. Wade and returned the regulation of abortion to “the people and their elected representatives.”\n\nIn other words, we need to convince him again. The absolute backwardness of having to convince someone that a preborn baby’s life has immeasurable value and deserves wholesale dignity is a commentary on the perverseness of our culture.\n\nWe pray for the marchers and their message. May it reach a receptive president’s ears.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/articles/124487-the-fight-for-the-preborn-is-at-a-pivotal-point-2026-01-23","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01KFM54NXR0W86V33R1023PPVV.jpeg?w=1200&h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 16:03:44","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.257},{"id":395419622,"title":"Maine ICE raids followed Trump clash with Democratic governor. That’s happened elsewhere too.","text":"Governor Janet Mills was among the officials Thursday who strongly criticized the ICE operations in her state. \n\n“In America, we don’t believe in secret arrests or secret police,” Mills said during a news briefing as ICE agents fanned out across Portland.\n\nThe deployment came months after Mills had publicly sparred with Trump over the issue of transgender athletes in women’s sports in Maine. \n\nAt a White House meeting in February, Trump told a room of bipartisan governors about his executive order banning “men from playing in women’s sports,” telling Democratic governors to continue fighting him on the legislation because “you’ll never win another race.”\n\nTrump then asked if the “Governor of Maine” was in attendance and instructed the state to comply with the law, saying to Mills: “You better do it, because you’re not going to get any federal funding at all if you don’t.” \n\nMills doubled down on the state’s position by saying Maine would “follow the law.” \n\n“We’ll see you in court,” she added.\n\n“Good, I’ll see you in court. I look forward to that — that should be a real easy one,” Trump said. “Enjoy your life after governor because I don’t think you’ll be in elected politics.”\n\nMills is currently seeking her party’s nomination for the US Senate. \n\nThe recent ICE deployments in Minnesota have become a flashpoint after an agent fatally shot Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, in Minneapolis on Jan. 7. \n\nDays before Good’s killing, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, former Vice President Kamala Harris’s running mate in 2024, had announced he wouldn’t seek reelection in Minnesota, citing Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into child care programs in the state. \n\nThat probe came as a far-right influencer claimed to have uncovered fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. \n\n“Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said when he announced he would not seek reelection. “They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.”\n\nGood was killed two days later as she tried to drive away from a group of ICE agents. \n\nTrump deployed the National Guard to Los Angeles in June to quell demonstrations against his immigration crackdown. \n\nTrump said federalizing the troops was necessary to “address the lawlessness” in California, while Governor Gavin Newsom, a likely Democratic presidential candidate in 2028, said the move was “purposely inflammatory” and would “only escalate tensions.”\n\nThe day after Trump was elected in November 2024, Newsom called on state lawmakers to convene a special session to safeguard the state’s progressive policies.\n\n“The freedoms we hold dear in California are under attack — and we won’t sit idle,” Newsom said at the time. He went on to launch a redistricting push in California to counter similar efforts in Texas. \n\nNewsom has also taken a page out of Trump’s social media playbook, often mocking the president online with all-caps posts that mirror Trump’s tone. \n\nLast month, a judge ordered Trump to end the National Guard deployment in Los Angeles. \n\nDemonstrators in the Chicago area took to the streets in the fall to protest the ICE crackdown there, prompting the Trump administration to seek a guard deployment to that city as well.\n\nThe administration had initially sought an order to allow the deployment of troops from Illinois and Texas, but the Texas contingent of about 200 guardsmen was later sent home from Chicago.\n\nIn December, the Supreme Court delivered a rare rebuke to the president, refusing to allow the guard to deploy to Chicago. \n\n“At this preliminary stage, the Government has failed to identify a source of authority that would allow the military to execute the laws in Illinois,” the high court majority wrote. Three conservative justices dissented.\n\nThroughout the controversy, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker has strongly criticized Trump, even urging constituents to hold mass protests.\n\n“Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption. But I am now,” Pritzker said in April during a speech to Democrats in New Hampshire. \n\n“These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace,” Pritzker continued. “They must understand that we will fight their cruelty with every megaphone and microphone that we have. We must castigate them on the soapbox … and then punish them at the ballot box.” \n\nMaterial from the Associated Press and from previous Globe coverage was used in this report. \n\nTravis Andersen can be reached at travis.andersen@globe.com.","url":"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2026/01/23/nation/maine-ice-raids-trump-mills-democrats/","image":"https://bostonglobe-prod.cdn.arcpublishing.com/resizer/v2/WFAWVOGD4UUXTGRCZPY3SNZ7XY.jpg?auth=820075ec73b0e1199a7e51959a2064574ff2aaa38044d158f74002016fde87c6&width=1200&height=672","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 16:00:41","author":"Travis Andersen Globe","authors":["Travis Andersen Globe"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.13},{"id":395342006,"title":"Nate Jackson: This Weekend's Other ICE Storm","text":"Much of the nation is deeply concerned about winter weather this weekend, but ICE is dominating the news coverage. Why? Because Leftmedia hysteria over the actions and tactics of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement helps Democrats and hurts the Bad Orange Man.\n\nThere are so many news ICEicles out there today, but I want to use those to better view the big picture, which is the Left’s tireless work to discredit everything President Donald Trump and his administration do. They don’t want to clean up ICE enforcement. They want to end ICE enforcement. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris opened the border, creating a humanitarian crisis, and now leftists say the real problem is cleaning up that mess.\n\nI’ll start with pollaganda — the use of polls to steer rather than reflect public opinion. In the wake of what I think was the justifiable shooting death of Renee Good, numerous media outlets are blaring headlines to say something along the lines of “Americans think ICE is going too far.” Yes, I’m sorry Good is dead. But the Leftmedia coverage of it has not been fair or honest, and emotion, not evidence, is dictating much of the public’s response.\n\nThat said, our Mark Alexander rightly warned in early December that ICE already had an optics problem — and that was before Good’s death or a whistleblower’s claim that an ICE policy allows agents to enter the home of a suspected illegal alien without a warrant. If true, that’s a significant problem, though I’m reserving judgment because of the left-wing operation to discredit ICE.\n\nRegardless of the truth or the Left’s lawless motivations, leftist agitators are successfully turning the public against ICE.\n\nThe latest example came yesterday. “ICE just detained a 5-year-old child,” Representative Ilhan Omar (D-Somalia) railed on X. “Don’t tell us this is about ‘the worst of the worst.’ That’s a lie. Absolutely vile.”\n\nWhat a missed opportunity for Omar to plug one of those Somali daycares her Minneapolis constituents run. I hear there are lots of openings.\n\nSarcasm aside, the Department of Homeland Security says Omar is lying: “As agents approached … Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias, [he] fled on foot — abandoning his child. For the child’s safety, one of our ICE officers remained with the child while the other officers apprehended Conejo Arias.”\n\nThat’s why both are in ICE custody, now in Texas. Leftists scream if children are separated from their parents, and they scream if a child is detained with his father. That’s because they’re screaming about enforcing immigration law, not about children. They certainly don’t raise much of a complaint about the human traffickers who abuse migrant children; only ICE receives their ire — for apprehending child sex offenders!\n\n“Parents are asked if they want to be removed with their children,” DHS added, “or ICE will place the children with a safe person the parent designates. This is consistent with past administrations’ immigration enforcement.” Furthermore, “Parents can take control of their departure and receive a free flight and $2,600 with the CBP Home app.”\n\nOfficials at the boy’s school claim that he was used “as bait” to lure his father out of his house. The Leftmedia bewails the “abhorrent” viral photo of the boy, though it looks totally innocuous to me.\n\nVice President JD Vance traveled to Minneapolis yesterday to address the broader situation and “bring down the temperature.” How did USA Today headline it? “Vice President Vance defends ICE detainment of 5-year-old in Minnesota.”\n\nThat was only one small part of Vance’s comments and purposes, but he did note, “If the argument is that you can’t arrest people who have violated the law because they have children, then every single parent is going to be completely given immunity from ever being the subject of law enforcement.”\n\nThat’s a fair point, but Conejo Arias’s attorney says, “These are not illegal aliens. They came properly and are pursuing a legal pathway.” That will need to be sorted out.\n\nVance also knew where to point a finger, saying, “Frankly, a lot of the media is lying about the job that [ICE agents] do every single day.”\n\nAs for the overall situation in Minnesota, Vance’s message was simple. Before he arrived, he said, “If you want to turn down the chaos in Minneapolis, stop fighting immigration enforcement and accept that we have to have a border in this country. It’s not that hard.” While there, he added, “The directive that I got from the president of the United States is ‘Meet these guys halfway.’ Work with them so that we can make these immigration enforcement operations successful without endangering our ICE officers, and so that we could turn down the chaos a little bit, at least. I think a lot, actually.”\n\nDemocrat Governor Tim Walz responded that he was “glad the Vice President agrees the temperature needs to be turned down, but actions speak louder than words.” His solution? “Take the show of force off the streets.”\n\nWhy is there a show of force? Because Minnesota is a sanctuary state where state and local officials don’t cooperate with federal officers. Why were Walz, state Attorney General Keith Ellison, and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey served with Justice Department subpoenas on Tuesday? For alleged conspiracy to obstruct federal law enforcement.\n\nMeanwhile, some anti-ICE activists who stormed that church service on Sunday found out that doing so is a crime.\n\n“We have arrested Nekima Levy Armstrong, who allegedly played a key role in organizing the coordinated attack on Cities Church in St. Paul, Minnesota,” announced Attorney General Pam Bondi. Later, she added, “A second arrest has been made at my direction. Chauntyll Louisa Allen has been taken into custody.”\n\nGiven that the anti-ICE agitators filmed themselves violating the FACE Act, it’s hard to argue with the arrests. Armstrong tried, however, telling CNN, “We did not rush into that church. We actually went and sat down and participated in the service.” Is that what you call it?\n\nFormer CNN personality Don Lemon, who entered the church with the protesters and live-streamed their intimidating service interruption — definitely only for the sake of journalism! (wink, wink) — has not been arrested. Never mind, I guess, that Lemon is on video announcing his disruptive intent, noting that Armstrong began her agitating work after George Floyd’s death.\n\nLemon’s lawyer, Abbe Lowell of Hunter Biden infamy, says the DOJ is engaged in a “stunning and troubling effort to silence and punish a journalist.” A magistrate judge rejected charges against Lemon. That judge, by the way, is connected to the anti-ICE Democrat machine, which seems like a conflict of interest. According to Fox News’s Bill Melugin, “Multiple sources tell me & colleague [David Spunt] that the federal magistrate in Minnesota who refused to sign off on an arrest warrant for Don Lemon is Douglas L. Micko and that his wife works as an Assistant Attorney General in Minnesota AG Keith Ellison’s office.”\n\nWhew, that’s a lot of news, but again, there’s a big picture.\n\nDemocrats, their Leftmedia propagandists, and their horde of left-wing agitators have a singular strategy: Discredit ICE and Trump by creating and filming confrontations with federal agents. Never mind that a lot of migrant criminals are in our nation illegally. Never mind that many of those criminals have victimized American citizens. Never mind the Rule of Law. The Left is waging a propaganda war against law enforcement.\n\nICE doesn’t always do everything perfectly, and there are definitely risks of overstepping. But those factors are exponentially increased when agitators provoke conflict. The ugly part is that’s exactly their strategy, even if it gets people killed.\n\nFollow Nate Jackson on X.","url":"https://patriotpost.us/articles/124490-this-weekends-other-ice-storm-2026-01-23","image":"https://img.patriotpost.us/01KFNRPX9WXT47E1K7AAQ07SB8.jpeg?w=1200&h=630","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 15:56:21","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.45},{"id":395352530,"title":"Scott Bessent Unleashes On Gavin Newsom For Calling Trump ‘T-Rex’ And Carrying Around Knee Pads","text":"Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rebuked Democratic California Gov.

He was not in danger,” Abrahamson retorted, ignoring the fact that footage from the incident captures Ross being propelled backward as Good’s vehicle makes contact with him and numerous reports that Ross suffered internal bleeding following the incident.\n\n“Just because you’re yelling doesn’t mean you’re winning an argument,” the student said, refusing to bend.\n\n“Just because you’re alive doesn’t mean you are intelligent,” Abrahamson clapped back.\n\nThe recording of this chaotic encounter, distributed by Libs of TikTok, has amassed nearly 4 million views on X and sparked intense debate over political indoctrination in classrooms.\n\n“This is a very pervasive issue,” Sara says, displaying the following memo recently distributed by the National Education Association arguing for increased anti-ICE activism.\n\nThis kind of left-wing activism poisoning America’s classrooms, Walters says, is “a coordinated effort from the teachers’ unions.”\n\n“‘Tell your students that the police are the enemy, that ICE is the enemy’ — and this is exactly what they're pushing into our schools,” he says. “It’s not a one-off. It’s not, well, you know, here’s some crazy left-wing socialist teacher. No, this is the teachers’ unions utilizing their foot soldiers to ... undermine this country through the classrooms.”\n\nSara brings up a recent Fox News article that exposed the NEA — the largest teachers’ union in the United States and the largest labor union overall in the country — for funneling millions in union funds during the 2024 fiscal year to various far-left and social justice-oriented groups and ballot initiatives.\n\n“In a lot of these places, the teachers don’t have a choice. They have to join the union. They have to pay the fees,” Sara says. “I mean, it’s adding insult to injury that you’re essentially stealing from someone because they want to have the occupation as a teacher and then you’re using it to fund [left-wing] causes.”\n\nWalters says that it’s paramount that we stop them.\n\n“We have to defund them. Every teacher, you should opt out. Go to optouttoday.com. Get out of the union. Quit paying union fees to destroy this country. ... And every state should be passing legislation to rail back on the union’s power. There shouldn’t be teachers’ unions,” he says.\n\n“What you have in the teachers’ union is this huge apparatus of power. They have a ton of money. They have a ton of resources. They are embedded in the Democrat Party. They are one of their biggest funders,” he continues.\n\nWalters warns that if we fail to defeat teachers’ unions, the consequences are potentially massive: “They’re going to gear up all this before the congressional elections, just like they did for Kamala Harris when over $400 million went from the teachers’ union to her presidential campaign. Same thing’s going to happen in this election cycle.”\n\nBut the money is just the weapon — the real war is in our classrooms.\n\nTeachers’ unions, Walters says, have been instrumental in brainwashing younger generations into becoming America-hating, die-hard Democrats.\n\n“We didn’t just wake up one day ... [with] millions of kids that sit here and think we’re an evil, racist country. They think cops are bad guys. That didn’t just happen. It happened because of a coordinated attack,” he says.\n\nThe viral video of Dr. Abrahamson insulting a student’s intelligence because he refused to condemn an ICE agent he believes acted in self-defense is merely one thread in a vast tapestry of proof.\n\n“We’ve got to turn this around 180 degrees in the other direction and go back to a patriotic education, love of country, love of American values. We’ve got to get back to that,” Walters urges.\n\nTo hear more of the conversation and see the viral video, watch the episode above.\n\nWant more from Sara Gonzales?\n\nTo enjoy more of Sara's no-holds-barred takes on news and culture, subscribe to BlazeTV — the largest multi-platform network of voices who love America, defend the Constitution, and live the American dream.","url":"https://www.theblaze.com/shows/sara-gonzales-unfiltered/just-because-you-re-alive-doesn-t-mean-you-are-intelligent-viral-video-shows-teacher-berating-student-for-defending-ice-agent-who-shot-renee-good","image":"https://www.theblaze.com/media-library/image.jpg?id=63087860&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C0%2C0%2C120","video":null,"publish_date":"2026-01-23 15:00:00","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.042},{"id":395425416,"title":"Antisemitism in VP vetting? | READER COMMENTARY","text":"When Pennsylvania Gov.

When reached by AFP by email, xAI replied with a terse automated response: “Legacy Media Lies.”\n\nLast week, following the global outrage, X announced that it would “geoblock the ability” of all Grok and X users to create images of people in “bikinis, underwear, and similar attire” in jurisdictions where such actions are illegal.\n\nIt was not immediately clear where the tool would be restricted.\n\nThe announcement came after California’s attorney general launched an investigation into xAI over the sexually explicit material and several countries opened their own probes.\n\nRelated Reads\n\nTánaiste says Cabinet proposals ready in weeks to deal with AI non-consensual sexual images \n\nProfessor Mary Aiken: Grok is a warning shot, not a one-off scandal\n\nX refuses to come before Oireachtas Media Committee to answer questions on Grok scandal\n\nIn Ireland, X has refused to come before the Oireachtas Media Committee next week to answer questions.\n\nGrok’s digital undressing spree comes amid growing concerns among tech campaigners over proliferating AI nudification apps.\n\nLast week, the Philippines became the third country to ban Grok, following Southeast Asian neighbors Malaysia and Indonesia, while Britain and France said they would maintain pressure on the company.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Philippines’s Cybercrime Investigation and Coordinating Center said it was ending the short-lived ban after xAI agreed to modify the tool for the local market and eliminate its ability to create “pornographic content.”\n\nToday, Dublin City Council said it will stop posting on X in light of the scandal.\n\nCEO Richard Shakespeare told representatives that it will review how they use social media “to ensure that the platforms we use, and our use of them, align with and support the City Council’s values”.\n\nView 3 comments\n\nSend Tip or Correction\n\nEmbed this post\n\nTo embed this post, copy the code below on your site\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmail “Grok ceated three million sexualised deepfakes in 11 days, including 23,000 of apparent children”.\n\nRecipient's Email\n\nFeedback on “Grok ceated three million sexualised deepfakes in 11 days, including 23,000 of apparent children”.\n\nYour Feedback\n\nYour Email (optional)\n\nReport a Comment\n\nPlease select the reason for reporting this comment.\n\nPlease give full details of the problem with the comment...\n\nThis is YOUR comments community.
