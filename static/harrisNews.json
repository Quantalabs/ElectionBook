While Baker concedes that Trump is unpopular, he describes pro-MAGA voters as “the most consequential political force of modern times, rewriting all of the rules along the way.”\n\nHere’s some context on Baker’s purple prose: Trump’s most significant political victory came in 2024 where he won the popular vote by 1.5% over former Vice President Kamala Harris. Trump lost the 2020 election by almost 5 points against former President Joe Biden and lost the popular vote in 2016 against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Former President Barack Obama, the most recent two-term president before Trump, won by over 7 points in 2008 and nearly 4 points in 2012.\n\nEven worse, Baker’s column comes after yet another bloody weekend during a Trump presidency, not to be confused with the steady succession of bloody weekends that occurred during his first term as COVID-19 ravaged the nation and he pushed quack medicine and anti-Chinese racism.\n\nOn Sunday, Minnesota House Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband, Mark, were shot dead in an apparent political assassination. State Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette were also shot at their home, but are expected to recover. Early reporting indicates the alleged shooter was a Trump fan who espoused similar views to him opposing abortion and LGBTQ+ rights. The shooting follows years of Trump endorsing and encouraging political violence—including the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol that he incited.\n\nOn the same day the killings occurred, Trump was indulging in another fantasy of his, presiding over a military parade on the streets of Washington, D.C. While the president previously expressed envy at well-organized military parades in other nations, the D.C. event was a sparsely attended affair that didn’t even have the polish of a military parade held the same day at Disney World.\n\nBut millions of Americans turned out on the very same day to protest Trump and his lackeys like Vice President JD Vance, House Speaker Mike Johnson, and billionaire benefactor Elon Musk at “No King” protests across the nation. Unsurprisingly, the Times could only muster a print headline noting “thousands” had marched.\n\nThis is an ongoing pattern at the Times. The writers there have veered from a cringe-inducing review of Trump’s presidential portrait (they claimed he was “smizing,” Tyra Banks-style) to uncritically regurgitating his spin on taxes to presenting an obvious political operative as a simple man-on-the-street Black Trump supporter.\n\nThe past 10 years have seen the mainstream media trying over and over to normalize Trump despite all his obvious abnormalities, and the Times has led the charge. Trump is unpopular, which shows that the public doesn’t buy the lies—but the Times is too busy cheering on and normalizing his administration to notice.\n\nRelated | 10 years of trouble, terror, and tussling thanks to Trump","summary":"The New York Times’ chief White House correspondent Peter Baker penned a “news analysis” on Monday that goes on at length about “The Age of Trump.” The cringe-worthy column, meant to coincide with the 10-year anniversary of Donald Trump first entering the Republican presidential race by maligning Mexican people as rapists, comes as the nation continues to deal with the fallout from his time in office—including rampant crime, countless deaths, and rising authoritarianism.\n\n\n\nBaker sounds more like a fan gushing over a celebrity than a journalist discussing a conspiracy theorist bigot with dictatorial aspirations.\n\n\n\n\nPresident Donald Trump salutes during a parade commemorating the Army's 250th anniversary, coinciding with his 79th birthday on June 14 in Washington, as Secretary of the Army Daniel Driscoll, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and first lady Melania Trump watch.\n\n\n“Ten years of jaw-dropping, woke-busting, scandal-defying, status quo-smashing politics that have transformed America for good or ill in ","url":"https://www.dailykos.com/story/2025/6/16/2328426/-New-York-Times-proclaims-The-Age-of-Trump-as-nation-goes-to-hell?pm_campaign=blog&pm_medium=rss&pm_source=","image":"https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1445760/story_image/AP25165681279913.jpg?1750110299","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-17 00:01:09","author":"Oliver Willis","authors":["Oliver Willis"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.054},{"id":332107910,"title":"China Vs. U.S.: AI Supremacy Requires Reliable Electricity","text":"displayed during the MWC (Mobile World Congress), the world's biggest mobile fair, in Barcelona on March 3, 2025. Surrounded by investment and innovation projects, the Mobile World Congress (MWC) kicks off today in Barcelona amid a context of euphoria but also tensions over artificial intelligence (AI), whose rapid advancement is shaking up the tech sector. (Photo by Manaure Quintero / AFP) (Photo by MANAURE QUINTERO/AFP via Getty Images)Less\nAFP via Getty Images\n\nWhat McKinsey & Company calls “The Race to Power AI” boils down to the emerging struggle between the U.S. and China for supremacy in artificial intelligence (AI) and the capabilities of its associated data centers. In a new report, Rocket Fuel for America’s AI Moon Shot, Dan Turner, Executive Director of Power the Future, has compared the situation to the space race between the U.S. and Russia in the 1950s and 1960s: “The race to develop artificial general intelligence will be the most significant economic and national security clash between the world’s great powers over the next generation.”\n\nWhile the U.S. has a clear lead in the development of both AI and data centers, China has demonstrated its commitment to be self-reliant on these new technologies to broaden its global reach for economic, military, and national security reasons. AI requires 24/7 power, and China is rapidly putting a plan in place to assure reliable electricity that will attract and support data centers. The U.S. does not have a coherent and continuing energy plan of any type. China’s central planning allows for development and sustainability, while the U.S. approach to energy changes every four years. The fact that organization and foresight are crucial in energy planning is demonstrated by energy thinker Robert Bryce’s warning: China has a chokehold on about three dozen key elements in the Periodic Table, with an average market share of around 70% for each.\n\nChina has recommitted to its reliance on coal power. In 2024, construction began on over 94 Gigawatts (GW) of coal capacity – the most since 2015 and more than half of the U.S. existing coal fleet. The Global Energy Monitor reports that China has 58 GW of coal announced, 158 GW in permitting, 204 GW under construction, and 1,171 GW operating, for a grand total of 1,591 GW of coal. This is more than the entire electricity generation capacity of the EU and Japan combined (read those two sentences again). Two points need to be emphasized: (1) the Chinese coal fleet is one of the youngest, most efficient in the world, so the existing coal units still have many decades of operation and (2) many of the mega plants the Chinese are bringing online are supercritical or ultra-supercritical facilities which produce significantly fewer emissions than standard coal plants. China leads in building advanced coal plants and is home to the most efficient units in the world.\n\nIn stark contrast, the U.S. seems intent on wiping coal-based electricity from the energy landscape. Over 300 coal plants have closed since 2010, and coal generation has declined from 45% of the Nation’s power to 16% today. Most importantly, just published in April, the 2025 Annual Energy Outlook (AEO) by the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects that from 2025 to 2035 coal generating capacity will plummet from 164 GW to only 3 GW. In concert, coal generation will decline 93% in just 10 years. This seems foolish since the U.S. has some 25-30% of the world’s coal, which is even more than China. And we already know that the U.S. natural gas industry is ready to meet this great challenge: “Chevron exec says data center gas plans 'moving very quickly.”\n\nLest one think the U.S. is relying on new nuclear plants to serve the baseload needs of data centers, the 2025 AEO projects both nuclear capacity and generation will decline by 2040. As Dan Turner at Power the Future points out, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is a model of bureaucratic inefficiency. Since 1990, only five applications have been approved and only two new plants have been built: the Vogtle reactors in Georgia.\n\nGiven this troubled history over the past 35 years, it is difficult to see nuclear making a major contribution in the next two decades unless excessive bureaucratic hurdles are rapidly eliminated. Reality check: “Trump’s Nuclear Plan Faces Major Hurdles.” Meanwhile, China currently has 58 operable reactors with a total capacity of 60 GW. At least 30 reactors, with a total capacity of 34 GW, are under construction. When it comes to winning the AI race, China means serious business: “China Unveils the World’s First AI-Powered Underwater Data Center!’’\n\nTo be fair, the EIA’s AEO does project substantial new capacity by 2040 but most of it is intermittent and non-baseload solar and wind of clear limited use to data centers without a large amount of backup batteries. And the caveat: the China chokehold looms large over this forecast: China controls 75% of solar panel manufacturing, 60% of the world’s turbine production capacity and confirmed by a May 21 headline from an EIA press release: “China dominates global trade of battery minerals.”\n\nThere is no doubt that President Trump has taken positive steps on both coal and nuclear, but the familiar issue of a sustainable plan remains. The President’s term ends in only three and a half years. After that, is it back to business as usual while China’s baseload coal plants accommodate for the next generation of data centers.\n\nAnd finally, we must remain clear for those saying that we should rely on just wind and solar here in the U.S. This is a provably dangerous position that cannot be taken seriously. We already know that the recent power outage in Spain and Portugal has raised questions about the reliability of renewables.\n\nFrance's Minister for Economy, Finance, Industry and Digital Security Bruno Le Maire, German Economy and Climate Minister Robert Habeck, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak, Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres and Australia's Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence Richard Marles, (Middle + Back row L-R) Google's James Manyika, Tino Cuellar, President of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Amba Kak, AI Now Institute, Arthur Mensch, Mistal AI, Adam Selipsky, Amazon Web Services, Nick Clegg, Meta, Yoshu Bengio, Yoshua Bengio, founder and scientific director of Mila at the Quebec AI Institute, Dario Amodei, Anthropic, Sam Altman, OpenAI, Mircrosoft's Brad Smith, Mustafa Suleyman, Inflection AI, Alondra Nelson, Institute for Advanced Study Professor of Social Science, Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind, Eric Schmidt, Schmidt Futures, Ian Hogarth, chair of the UK frontier AI taskforce and Reid Hoffman, Inflection AI, pose for a family photo on the second day of the UK Artificial Intelligence (AI) Safety Summit at Bletchley Park on November 2, 2023 in Bletchley, England.

On “The Bulwark,” Moran said journalists are only required to be “fair and accurate,” claiming his rant met those standards.\n\n“My own feeling is you don’t sacrifice your citizenship as a journalis[t]. And your job is not to be objective,” Moran said. “There is no Mount Olympus of objectivity where a Mandarin class of wise people have no feelings about what happens in their society.”\n\n“We’re all in this together. What you have to be is fair and accurate. And I would refer to the interview with [President Donald Trump] that I did or a lot of my work,” he continued. “And I would also say that this, while very hot, is an observation, a description that is accurate and true.”\n\nAn ABC spokesperson told CNN’s Brian Stelter that Moran’s post clearly breached the policies of ABC News, specifically noting the outlet mandates “objectivity” for its reporters.\n\n“We are at the end of our agreement with Terry Moran and based on his recent post – which was a clear violation of ABC News policies – we have made the decision to not renew,” the spokesperson said.\n\n“At ABC News, we hold all of our reporters to the highest standards of objectivity, fairness and professionalism, and we remain committed to delivering straightforward, trusted journalism,” the spokesperson added, according to Stelter.\n\nABC News initially suspended Moran on June 8 after he posted his lengthy and scathing condemnation of Miller on X. “Miller is a man who is richly endowed with the capacity for hatred,” Moran concluded in his post. “He’s a world-class hater.”\n\nThe post drew backlash from Vice President JD Vance, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt and Miller himself on June 8.\n\n“The most important fact about Terry’s full public meltdown is what it shows about the corporate press in America,” Miller posted on X. “For decades, the privileged anchors and reporters narrating and gatekeeping our society have been radicals adopting a journalist’s pose. Terry pulled off his mask.”\n\nABC News debate moderators Linsey Davis and David Muir also faced criticism for fact-checking Trump significantly more often than former Vice President Kamala Harris during their only debate during the 2024 presidential election.\n\nWhile Harris made multiple misstatements during the debate, the moderators did not interrupt or fact-check her.\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

But it’s exhilarating.”\n\n The 2024-25 season provided many with the opportunity to relive the blissful burnout associated with NBC’s iconic sketch show, as the 50th anniversary run brought back almost every notable living alum. Nothing epitomized that more than the February primetime special celebrating the milestone, but the reunion started five months earlier — when the final days of the 2024 presidential election called on several familiar faces to portray the main players. As with almost everything at SNL, that came together after a few calls from executive producer Lorne Michaels last summer.\n\n “Lorne called before that crazy debate and said, ‘You’ll come out, it’ll be New York in the fall, you’ll do six shows, and then, if that’s all you want, you can tell us to fuck off,’ ” says Carvey, incapable of quoting his old boss without slipping into a dead-on impersonation. Before he signed on, the comic made sure that nobody on the current payroll wanted the part. Writer and producer Steve Higgins asked around for Carvey, even checking with past Biden impersonator Mikey Day. Nobody bit.\n\n Then came Biden’s catastrophic debate performance, which prompted the 46th president to abandon the race and endorse Kamala Harris. Carvey assumed his gig had gone the way of Biden’s hopes for a second term when, in reality, the historic circumstances just made the performance that much more tricky. “There were so many sensitivities,” he says, “and if you ding Biden, you’re making Trump happy.”\n\n For Maya Rudolph, this was not her first rodeo. The 2000-2007 castmember began sporadically guesting as the former vice president in 2019. But the pressure on the actress was similar to Carvey’s. With the highest-stakes election of her lifetime on the line, Rudolph wanted a funny parody — and a flattering one. “I wanted her to feel good about it,” says Rudolph, who’d previously gotten positive feedback from the onetime California senator. “I also wanted her to win, so I did everything in my power to try to do that — to make what I felt was my contribution to being on the right side of history.”\n\n Harris was said to be happy with Rudolph’s performance, so much so that she agreed to a very last-minute, surprise cameo during the final episode before the election. With five campaign stops in Pennsylvania earlier that day, Harris didn’t have time to attend rehearsal. So, when that cold open saw Rudolph, in character, leave fellow alum Andy Samberg (on hand to play Harris’ husband, Douglas Emhoff) and greet the real Harris on the other side of a dummy vanity mirror, it came as a genuine shock for viewers. Both Rudolph and Michaels have said they’ve never heard a bigger gasp from an SNL audience.\n\n “Introducing her, watching her enjoyment looking at Wally [Feresten] holding cue cards and getting to say ‘Live From New York’ for the first time, I just thought, ‘Wow, I wish my mom could see this,’ ” says Rudolph. “There was a beautiful little bubble around the studio. There was a shine to that night.”\n\n Trump trounced Harris that Tuesday. Rudolph moved on. Carvey, who had one more Biden and a brief stab at Elon Musk in him, stuck around for three more episodes. And Streeter Seidell, one of SNL‘s three head writers, found himself leaning more and more on castmember James Austin Johnson, the show’s de facto Trump since Alec Baldwin hung up his orange wig.\n\n “The cold opens were a challenge because I’m not necessarily a politically minded comedy writer, but it was a super fun — and stressful, especially during the election,” said Seidell. “The latter half of the season, it was a lot of James basically doing stand-up as Trump.”\n\n Political comedy tends to serve SNL well. Average ratings for the 50th season hit 8.1 million viewers, a three-year high. The tally doesn’t include the reunion special that reached 15 million. The event that Tina Fey likened to “the best cousins reunion” brought back five decades’ worth of alums (cast and writers) for more than three hours of nostalgia, new material and the highest concentration of talent Studio 8H has ever seen.\n\n “It was absolutely unreal,” says Ego Nwodim, a castmember since 2018. “To be in the company of so many performers I grew up watching and admiring, seeing Eddie Murphy as funny as he’s ever been, in my mind, I was like, ‘This should be illegal.’ “\n\n For many at the show, it was a weekend of dream casting. Day, on SNL since 2013, recalls being largely on the sidelines for the 40th anniversary; this time, he got to work with Meryl Streep, who has been on his “dream host list forever.”\n\n As he and Seidell tell it, Kate McKinnon (2012 to 2022) first thought of casting Streep as the mother of Colleen Rafferty — the woman who recounts her obscene alien abductions. Michaels made the initial call, naturally, and McKinnon and Streep began texting ideas. “In our head, Meryl was just going to do a version of Kate, but she really put her own spin on it,” says Day. Adds Seidell: “Giving her a script with the words ‘cooter’ and ‘tooter’ in it was in itself an experience to remember. What’s more remarkable is that it was the first thing she’s ever done on the show.”\n\n Wish fulfillment extended beyond current staff. Pell came back with hopes of revisiting two of her favorite creations. Marty and Bobbi, the awkward music teachers played by Will Ferrell and Ana Gasteyer, appeared during the SNL50: The Homecoming Concert just two nights before the anniversary. Rachel Dratch’s Debbie Downer, star of one of the most memorable bits in SNL history for its track record of causing so many to break character, made it to the main stage — with another notable cameo. “I can now die knowing that I got Robert De Niro in a Debbie Downer sketch, staring into the camera during the ‘womp womp,’ ” says Pell. “Just put me in the dirt.”\n\n Rudolph was desperate to introduce the Bronx Beat ladies to Linda Richmond from “Coffee Talk” that would involve her collaborating with one of her comedy heroes. “I’ve never had the chance to express to Mike Myers [1989 to 1995] how much he means to me, how in love I am with him as a performer,” she says. “That he wanted to do that with characters that Amy Poehler and I created was truly my fantasy football … I guess? I don’t know how fantasy football works.”\n\n The special may have felt like a punctuation mark on the season, but there were still eight more episodes and a barrage of absurdities to lampoon courtesy of the new administration. If there was a highlight for the staff, it was arguably Nwodim’s Miss Eggy.\n\n In the wake of news that the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner was capitulating to the new regime and nixing its traditional roast, Nwodim used the show to pitch an alternative. She and writers Josh Patten, Carl Tart, Asha Ward and Will Stephen created a comedian of their own. They’d pay homage to the Black female stand-ups of the 1990s, only to have the entire set revolve around the frustration of Nwodim’s alter ego with the WHCD food.\n\n She roasted the menu during her own “Weekend Update” segment on the April 5 episode. During a call-and-response with the audience, which colleague Bowen Yang dubbed his “favorite televised moment ever,” Nwodim accidentally inspired the crowd to drop a few four-letter words that weren’t censored during the live telecast. Headlines about FCC fines, exaggerated by Colin Jost, followed. That did not stop her from a reprise performance for the May 17 season finale.\n\n “She’s sort of primed for encore performances,” says Nwodim, who just may have come up with a character to be revisited in a future SNL anniversary. “And I was not fined by the FCC. That was, in fact, a bit.”\n\n This story first appeared in a June stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

It was more a “progressive grievance buffet” than a focused protest.\n\nIf you didn’t see any of the protests, this screed by Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, captured the overall feel.\n\nThe name of the movement may be “No Kings,” but monarchy didn’t really seem to be their chief concern. Several of the demonstrations had to be renamed because they took place in Canada and in other countries where they technically have a king.\n\nMonarchy and even arbitrary rule clearly weren’t their primary issues.\n\nJust a few months ago, the same type of people allegedly mad about kings were only too happy to celebrate King Charles’ visit to Canada. He didn’t disappoint. The king began his speech in Canada’s parliament with a “land acknowledgment” to satisfy his subjects’ desire to recognize that while the entire history of their nation is illegitimate, they don’t actually have to do anything about it other than feel good about the self-flagellation.\n\nFor the American protesters I find it hard to believe they just really hate royal symbolism. After all, at one point in our country’s distant past—when most of this weekend’s protests were young and “anti-establishment”—there was all kinds of media praise for “Camelot,” the Kennedy political dynasty. I’m guessing many of these protesters cast a vote for a Kennedy or two.\n\nThe anti-monarchy or even executive power message just doesn’t make sense. They didn’t care when President Barack Obama, the “pen and phone” president, was tearing up immigration laws to enact amnesty by executive fiat.\n\nWhen former President Joe Biden was acting like a typical king of old, spending his days taking naps and eating ice cream while his advisers did authoritarian things like randomly declare new constitutional amendments official on social media, they were nowhere to be found.\n\nWhen Vice President Kamala Harris was simply made the Democrat presidential nominee without any primary or decision by voters it seemed more like a coronation than democracy. Again, we didn’t see a “No Kings” protest then. Only now that Democrats are out of power, that unaccountable institutions are being held to account, are they taking to the streets.\n\nAnd that’s what I think is the deeper message of these protests, though I am really stretching the word “deep” here.\n\nThe supporters of the old institutional order are raging at their sudden impotence in the face of a political counterrevolution.\n\nThey are enraged by the unraveling of that old order that insisted we “believe in science,” while science institutions embraced ideology over truth.\n\nThey were for COVID-19 lockdowns when it was clear they were actually hurting children and destroying lives.\n\nThey embraced the Great Awokening that aimed at casting all American history, including that whole “no kings” 1776 thing into the fire.\n\nTheir flag is not the American flag of the republic, not really. It’s the transgender, “woke” flag of intersectionality.\n\nThey are the dwindling demographic that still listens to legacy media and insists they are fair and objective as most Americans tune out.\n\nWhat they are actually for is the unelected bureaucracy that has over time crowded out and has been slowly supplanting our federal republic.\n\nThey are an alternate universe version of the Tea Party movement that exploded in 2009. Only this movement isn’t protesting on behalf of the Constitution or any issue in particular. They are protesting in favor of the progressive constitutional order represented by our corrupted institutions.\n\nThey are desperate for the country to embrace the litany of deeply unpopular issues fully embraced by the elite institutional regime but largely loathed by most Americans.\n\nThis was an aging, middle-class white liberal primal scream.\n\nAmerica doesn’t have a king, so mission accomplished. It also doesn’t need to be controlled by unaccountable, deep state bureaucrats who think they have a right to rule and not the American people.","summary":"“No Kings” protests of various sizes broke in mostly blue cities on Saturday.

It polled 785 New Jersey adults on May 28-30 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 6.1 percentage points.The SurveyUSA poll also found that Ciattarelli and Sherrill had similar favorability ratings among New Jersey voters, and that a slightly higher percentage of the state's voters are familiar with Ciattarelli, who was the GOP gubernatorial nominee in 2021.Ciattarelli was viewed favorably by 40 percent of voters, while Sherrill was viewed favorably by 41 percent of voters. Twenty-five percent were unfamiliar with Ciattarelli, while 30 percent were unfamiliar with Sherrill.The Ciattarelli campaign told Newsweek on Monday:\"Make no mistake that this is a 'CHANGE' election and Ciattarelli is the CHANGE candidate. A majority of New Jersey voters (54 percent) believe that the state is heading in the wrong direction, while only 33 percent believe things in New Jersey are going in the right direction. Notably, Ciattarelli leads Sherrill by a whopping 72 percent to 14 percent margin among those wrong-track voters, and an even stronger 87 percent to 6 percent among voters who want a governor who will 'shake up Trenton.'\"Dan Cassino, professor of government and politics at Fairleigh Dickinson University, told Newsweek earlier in June that while Sherrill is well known in her district, she will need to work to improve her name recognition across the state.Campaigns typically release internal polling for a number of reasons, such as to show their candidates' potential strength to national fundraisers, and these sorts of surveys are generally not considered as reliable as independent polling. Still, the polls may provide an early look at the state of the race.Both candidates are vying to replace term-limited Governor Phil Murphy, a Democrat. Republicans have not won a New Jersey gubernatorial race since 2013 and haven't carried it on the presidential level since 1988. But Republicans see a chance to make more inroads with voters after Trump narrowed his margin in the state by 10 points. He lost it by six points in 2024, down from a 16-point loss in 2020 and 14 in 2016.What People Are SayingMicah Rasmussen, director of the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University, previously told Newsweek: \"It is certainly possible that New Jersey could elect a Republican governor in November. Governor Murphy was the first Democrat to be reelected in more than 40 years, and in that same span, three Republican governors were elected and reelected.\"Kyle Kindik of Sabato's Crystal Ball, in a June 11 report: \"The main reasons to favor Sherrill are that she has been a good electoral performer in the House—although she was not strongly pushed in her four general election races—and that she is a Democrat running in what is still a Democratic-leaning state in what should be at least a modestly Democratic-leaning environment with Donald Trump in the White House. That said, she is also running for a third straight Democratic gubernatorial term, so Ciattarelli can make an argument for change at the state level.\"Alex Ball, Sherrill's campaign manager, told Newsweek in May: \"New Jersey saw in the debate why Mikie Sherrill continues to lead in every poll: her lifelong commitment to service, strong record getting big things done and her ability to beat Trump Republicans at every turn. Republicans are afraid to go up against Mikie in November because she knows how to win and then deliver for New Jerseyans.\"What Happens NextCiattarelli and Sherrill will spend the coming months making their cases to New Jersey voters about why they are the strongest candidates to lead the state. The Cook Political Report classifies the race as leaning Democrat—meaning it is \"considered competitive\" but Democrats have \"an advantage.\"","summary":"The Democratic congresswoman held a narrow lead in the Ciattarelli campaign's latest internal poll of the gubernatorial race.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jack-ciattarelli-within-striking-distance-mikie-sherrill-internal-poll-2086356","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2664224/new-jersey-governo-race-split-image.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 20:57:16","author":"Andrew Stanton","authors":["Andrew Stanton"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.262},{"id":332073940,"title":"Trump Parade Turnout Swamped by Millions Who Protested at ‘No Kings’ Rallies","text":"Saturday’s “No Kings” protests drew millions of Americans out into the streets to voice their opposition to President Donald Trump’s increasingly autocratic, authoritarian governance. On Monday, the ACLU declared that over five million people had assembled across 2,000 demonstrations. That number was echoed by other organizations partnered with “No Kings,” which was organized to counter the “dictator-style” military parade Trump organized for his own birthday.\n\n While the liberal opposition has been trumpeting its impact, the Trump administration has muted about how many people showed up to his parade, which ostensibly also honored the founding of the U.S. Army 250 years ago.\n\n In a statement to Rolling Stone, a spokesperson for America250 — the public arm of the congressionally authorized U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission, which organized the parade — offered an eye-popping estimate, suggesting that “250,000 patriots joined us on Saturday, despite the threat of heavy rain. In addition, more than 60 million Americans tuned in across streaming platforms and traditional broadcast media.”\n\n 250,000 would, implausibly, put the parade attendance on par with the turnout for historic gatherings including the 1965 March on Washington for Peace in Vietnam, and Martin Luther King Jr.’s 1963 March on Washington, where he delivered the “I Have a Dream” speech. \n\n The estimate of 250,000 on the 250th anniversary of the Army at an event titled “America250”? It’s a little on the nose, and does not match on-the-ground reports of turnout. The White House sent Rolling Stone a link to a Department of Defense tweet stating that “HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS of proud Americans” attended the event. The White House would not clarify how many hundreds of thousands, or what entity had produced that estimate. \n\n Saturday’s parade was, at least officially, staged to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the formation of the U.S. Army. Unofficially, the $45 million pageant of tanks, battalions, choppers, and bombers was the fulfillment of President Trump’s long held goose-marching fantasies. The fact that it took place on his birthday was (legally) a coincidence. \n\n The parade felt less like the imposing show of military might envisioned, and more like a mobilized display for military history aficionados. And turnout reflected it. As previously reported by Rolling Stone, attendance at the parade was sparse for an event whose staging disrupted large swaths of Washington D.C. Risers intended to be packed with enthusiastic Trump fans remained underfilled throughout the parade. The lawns around the Washington monument, which had been blocked off in anticipation of a huge gathering, remained sparesly populated, even as the attendees coalesced in front of a central stage to hear the post-parade lineup of speakers, including the president. \n\n It wouldn’t be the first time Trump and his allies have gone to war with reality over crowd sizes to sooth the president’s ego. One would struggle to forget his 2017 meltdown over the size of the inaugural crowd during his first term. On Jan. 6, 2021, the president demanded that security be loosened around the Ellipse in order to pack the crowd at his now infamous “Stop The Steal” speech. (He later claimed that he’d drawn a bigger crowd the 1963 March on Washington. He had not.) As previously reported by Rolling Stone, during the 2024 campaign cycle, Trump privately obsessed over the size of crowds attending the rallies of his opponent — former Vice President Kamala Harris — at one point accusing her campaign of manipulating images of the crowd with AI.\n\n After videos of squeaky tanks, half empty grandstands, and soldiers marching out of step went viral on social media, the parade became the subject of widespread mockery. Not out of disregard for the Army and its history, but because the entire event felt like a poorly executed effort to entertain the man who is currently deploying active duty Marines to Los Angeles to support ICE raids against migrant communities and intimidate those who oppose him.\n\n In Los Angeles — where anti-ICE protests and clashes with law enforcement have been taking place for more than a week — “No Kings” organizers estimated 200,000 people turned out for the city’s demonstration. The New York Police Department estimated that 50,000 marched in Manhattan. In Boston, a joint gathering of Pride Month revelers and No Kings protesters drew an estimated 1 million attendees over the course of the day. Even in smaller cities like Anchorage, Alaska; Louisville, Kentucky; and Tuscon, Arizona, “No Kings” protests managed to draw thousands into the streets. In line with organizer estimates, an independent number cruncher pegs total “No Kings” turnout at between 4 and 6 million.\n\n The Trump administration may chose to bury how many people actually showed up to the Mall to watch the president’s Army’s birthday parade, but what they cannot hide is that millions more chose to take to the streets all around the country to reject him.","summary":"The militaristic extravaganza Trump envisoned for his birthday was no match for the millions that protested his policies nationwide","url":"https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-parade-turnout-protest-no-kings-millions-1235365602/","image":"https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Kings-Turnout-vs-trump-parade.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 20:25:06","author":"Nikki McCann Ramirez,Tim Dickinson","authors":["Nikki McCann Ramirez","Tim Dickinson"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.214},{"id":332080046,"title":"FLASHBACK: Trump launched his first presidential campaign ten years ago","text":"Ten years ago Monday, businessman Donald J.

As an Israel–Iran war erupted and intensified, he showed the world that he has little power to shape events or, perhaps worse, no idea of how to wield the considerable power he has. At the same time, an Army parade doubling as a much-ballyhooed personal birthday party lured few spectators, to his apparent disgruntlement, raising doubts about the continued appeal of his theatrical showstoppers.\n\nIt is still unclear whether Trump was sincere last week in scheduling a sixth round of diplomatic talks with Iran for Sunday, June 15, or whether he was engaging in a ruse, helping to ensure that Israel would achieve strategic surprise by attacking Friday, June 13. After the bombs began to fall, he tried to have it both ways or, actually, as many ways as one could possibly count—claiming that he had known about Israel’s plans all along, hailing the attack’s initial success, while also urging Tehran to come to the talks and “make a deal” anyway, calling on all parties to stop fighting and asking Russian President Vladimir Putin to help mediate. Yet Trump did nothing to push the war to one sort of conclusion or another, finally saying—as he had when he failed to end the Russia–Ukraine war, despite his earlier boasts that he would stop it on his first day in office—that sometimes you have to let a war “go a little bit,” like with “two kids fighting in a schoolyard,” adding, “We’ll see what happens.”\n\nOn Monday, Iran’s supreme leader, the Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called for de-escalation and the resumption of talks. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will likely scoff at the offer, taking it as a sign that Israel is winning and should therefore rev up the pressure. How Trump will react, if at all, is unclear. Asked by fellow Western leaders at today’s G7 meeting in Canada about how he thinks the war should go, Trump remained vague, asking for immediate talks but declining to sign a joint statement recommending de-escalation.\n\nIf Kamala Harris (or anyone else) were president, Trump would be shouting from the sidelines that this war would never have happened if he’d been elected because Netanyahu respects him and the Iranians fear him. And yet here we are. This should be kept in mind when Trump says—as he has many times and likely will many times more—that Putin would not have invaded Ukraine, and Hamas not have attacked Israel, if he were president, for those same reasons of respect and fear.\n\nThe fact is, no world leaders respect or fear Trump, at least not to the extent that they feel compelled to alter what they see as their national interests (though, of course, many of these leaders, who rely on the United States for some benefits, pretend that they do). Trump’s behavior over the weekend only reinforces the widespread view that his bark is worse than his bite, that he can’t be trusted to follow through on any threat, and—as might be seen in the parade’s dim showing—that his appeal on the home front might be waning as well.\n\nTrump is not entirely without powers of persuasion. The BBC reported that Trump vetoed a plan by Netanyahu to kill Khamenei. Trump could have told Netanyahu, his most pliant ally, to stop the bombing altogether—or, contrarily, joined in the attack to boost the chance of victory. But he did neither, instead remaining passive. This claim of passivity kidded nobody except maybe himself. Though he didn’t join the attack, he did help Israel defend itself from Iranian missiles—in other words, the U.S. is now involved in the war, and Netanyahu will now, of course, do all he can to deepen that involvement. For instance, if Israel wants to destroy Iran’s nuclear infrastructure, and not just set it back by a few months or years, it will need to demolish the Fordow uranium enrichment plant, buried deep inside a mountain. Only the U.S. has the weapons that can do this—the 30,000-pound Massive Ordnance Penetrator, carried by a B-2 bomber. Will Trump be persuaded to do the job—or leave this nuclear target unravaged? (Israel could level the mountain with one of its nuclear bombs, but there’s no sign that even Netanyahu would be inclined to go that far.)\n\nIt’s unclear because Trump hasn’t made clear, perhaps not even to himself, his strategy and tactics in this war—what he would like to see happen and how to help make it so.\n\nTrump came into office boasting of his prowess as a dealmaker, a talent that would render him an ideal peacemaker, much more so than any of his predecessors in the White House. The events of the past weekend—coming on top of his failures to close many other hotly pursued deals during his five months in office so far—illustrate, once again, that being president of the United States is a very different job from being a real-estate tycoon; that dealing with foreign powers, in the complexities of an increasingly anarchic world, is much harder than bargaining with the New York City Department of Buildings.","summary":"The president seems to have no clear plan for the Iran–Israel war.","url":"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/06/iran-israel-war-donald-trump-plan.html?via=rss","image":"https://compote.slate.com/images/6a643d87-0b7f-40e1-a022-bb815788a8e6.jpeg?crop=1560%2C1040%2Cx0%2Cy0&width=1200","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 19:05:52","author":"Fred Kaplan","authors":["Fred Kaplan"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.23},{"id":332062046,"title":"Understanding Juneteenth: Its Significance and Celebration in 2025 Amidst Federal DEI Challenges Under Trump","text":"It was 160 years ago that enslaved individuals in Galveston, Texas, were informed of their freedom, occurring after the conclusion of the Civil War and two years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nThe Juneteenth holiday that followed, named by merging “June” and “nineteenth,” has expanded over the one-and-a-half centuries since. In 2021, President Joe Biden declared it a federal holiday, thereby broadening its recognition beyond the Black community in America.\n\nThis year marks the first Juneteenth during President Donald Trump’s second term, a period during which diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives have been prohibited in federal institutions. This prohibition has included the removal of Black American historical content from federal online platforms. Furthermore, Trump administration officials have advised some federal departments against acknowledging other ethnic heritage celebrations. \n\nStill, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.\n\n“I don’t think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. “I’ve not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.”\n\nPeople who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a “right” way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth more of a solemn day of remembrance or a party?\n\nIt depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans’ true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as “Black Codes,” enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\nPlans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\n“The most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question ‘What is Juneteenth?'” Morial said.\n\nWhat if you’ve never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nDr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn’t learn about it until his 30s.\n\n“I think many folks haven’t known about it – who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn’t celebrate it,” Anderson said. “It was like just a part of history. It wasn’t a celebration of history.”\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn’t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are taking place?\n\nSearch online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnivalesque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you’ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth’s history.\n\nThe National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.\n\nAre there special Juneteenth decorations or foods?\n\nThe red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.\n\nMore people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth’s birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nIn recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.\n\n“I would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,” Morial said. “If you got to participate in that (commercialism), that’s what I would do.”\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren’t Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there’s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you’re not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n“I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,” Brown said. “It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. … Isn’t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.”\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n“Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we’re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,” Brown said. “Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.”\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt’s typical to wish people a “Happy Juneteenth” or “Happy Teenth,” according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.\n\n“You know how at Christmas people will say ‘Merry Christmas’ to each other and not even know each other?” Freeman said. “You can get a ‘Merry Christmas’ from everybody. This is the same way.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nIt was 160 years ago that enslaved individuals in Galveston, Texas, were&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Understanding Juneteenth: Its Significance and Celebration in 2025 Amidst Federal DEI Challenges Under Trump first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/understanding-juneteenth-its-significance-and-celebration-in-2025-amidst-federal-dei-challenges-under-trump/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/What-is-Juneteenth-and-why-is-it-celebrated-What-to.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 19:03:03","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.287},{"id":332067512,"title":"Dasma e Alex Soros/ Eventi që bashkoi politikën nga e gjithë bota, Rama fjalim urimi për çiftin","text":"Establishmenti demokrat u mblodh këtë fundjavë në Hamptons për një dasmë që ngjante me një kurorëzim mbretëror në botën e politikës – një event që bashkoi politikanë të njohur dhe figurat më me ndikim të epokës Clinton.\n\nTë sapomartuarit Alex Soros, djali i George Soros – donatori më bujar i Partisë Demokratike dhe Huma Abedin, ndihmëse politike e cila shpesh është përshkruar si vajza e Hillary Clinton, ish-Zonjë e Parë dhe Sekretare Shteti.

Rivers, who is a staunch opponent of Trump going back to the president’s first term in office, said Democrats need to make a change and try to get everyone on the same side of issues. CLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM \"Well, the first thing we have to point towards is getting out of our comfort zone and thinking if we keep doing the same thing we are going to get different results,\" Rivers told MSNBC’s Nicolle Wallace on her podcast. \"That doesn't happen, there needs to be change from the Democratic side. I don't know what that change is, but I know the norm has not worked. The norm worked on the popular vote, but there are states that haven't voted on the Democratic side in 50 years. \"We are a party of being [inclusive], everybody is included, right? But I remember Cory Booker, we are at a function, and I ask him why can't the Democrats all agree on something, because the Republicans do that well. You have to look at some of the things they do well. One of the things they do is they fall in line. They don't care. If you listen to some of the things these guys said about Trump and then when you hear them speak now, all they do is praise, they are falling in line. But he said something interesting. He said we have so many groups on our side, we don't just have the White male. We have everybody, and to get everybody to agree on one thing is very difficult, but we're going to have to start doing that if we want change.\" Rivers said one of the things Democrats need to get away from is the \"Trump won because\" debate. He made an analogy to how he would go about coaching a game if the team was coming off a loss. ANTONIO BROWN TAKES SWIPE AT MEDIA AS HE FACES ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGE IN FLORIDA \"I think we need to take the ‘because’ out, and I am serious, Trump won and start there, not ‘because.’ Trump won and what do we have to do differently? You have to take ownership of things. We do it in sports all the time,\" he told Wallace. \"Yeah, I come in after a game we lost ‘because.’ But then I say we lost, but we have to do these things differently if we want to win. We can't just say we lost because ‘they just made a lot of shots.’ Then we have to force them to miss more shots, we have to do something different. It is so strange we are blaming the people who voted for Trump for why he won. It makes no sense to me. It’d backwards.\" Rivers said the bottom line was the Democrats didn’t get enough people to actually go out and vote. \"We didn't get enough people out to vote,\" he said. \"That is one thing. We have to figure out, first start with ourselves, how can we ignite ourselves, our side to vote more, because we have more people to vote. We have to make them excited, we have to connect to them. We’re not connecting. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP \"We complain about Black men. You know, the majority of Black men did vote for Kamala, as it turns out. It is just that it wasn't a big majority. It wasn't enough people. Why is that? There is a feel of hopelessness in our community. I think a lot of Black men are saying now it does not matter, either side, we are not being helped, we are still being incarcerated. We still are struggling. So there has got to be an answer. And we have to figure out how we can answer that question if we are looking at that part of it for sure.\" Fox News' Connor McGahan contributed to this report.

In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday - expanding its recognition beyond Black America.\n\nThis year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump's second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.\n\nStill, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.\n\n\"I don't think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,\" said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. \"I've not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.\"\n\nPeople who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth more of a solemn day of remembrance or a party?\n\nIt depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\nPlans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.\n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\n\"The most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question 'What is Juneteenth?'\" Morial said.\n\nWhat if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\nDr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\n\n\"I think many folks haven't known about it - who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are taking place?\n\nSearch online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnivalesque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth's history.\n\nThe National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.\n\nAre there special Juneteenth decorations or foods?\n\nThe red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.\n\nMore people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth's birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nIn recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.\n\n\"I would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,\" Morial said. \"If you got to participate in that (commercialism), that's what I would do.\"\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.\n\n\"You know how at Christmas people will say 'Merry Christmas' to each other and not even know each other?\" Freeman said. \"You can get a 'Merry Christmas' from everybody.

Stitching the clip with a few seconds of footage of the parade singer’s breathless live rendition of the self-love anthem — performed in front of a gathering on the National Mall — Lizzo then cuts to a shot of herself staring pointedly at the camera, looking perplexed and disgusted.\n\n “cease & desist,” she wrote in the caption.\n\n The choice to perform “About Damn Time” at Trump’s procession was certainly an interesting one, as Lizzo — who endorsed Kamala Harris in the 2024 election — has made her disapproval of the twice-impeached POTUS very clear over the years. \n\n She’s not the only one. While Trump was celebrating the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday — as well as his own 79th birthday, which was also Saturday — through a grand show of military might in D.C., a slew of “No Kings” gatherings broke out across the country in protest of his administration. Those overlapped with the ongoing protests in Los Angeles against the country’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency, which recently launched raids into multiple workplaces across the city in the name of alleged immigration violations.\n\n Lizzo also posted several times about the ICE raids on Bluesky a few days prior to her TikTok about the military parade. “The irony of an ice agent forcing a Mexican person off of their ancestral land when that agent’s ancestors are European immigrants is just…,” she wrote in one post, adding in another: “And still … there are people who voted for this who are going to sleep with a smile on their faces pleased as pie … It’s a wild world y’all.”\n\n See Lizzo’s TikTok below.","summary":"The musician recently spoke out against the administration's ICE raids in Los Angeles.","url":"https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/lizzo-trump-parade-about-damn-time-1236000173/","image":"https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/lizzo-breakthrough-prize-2025-billboard-1548.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 18:09:57","author":"Hannah Dailey","authors":["Hannah Dailey"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.066},{"id":332027938,"title":"A guide to what the Juneteenth holiday is and how to celebrate it","text":"By TERRY TANG\n\nIt was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed — after the Civil War’s end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.\n\nThe resulting Juneteenth holiday — its name combining “June” and “nineteenth” — has only grown in one-and-a-half centuries.

So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.”\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt’s typical to wish people a “Happy Juneteenth” or “Happy Teenth,” according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.\n\n“You know how at Christmas people will say ‘Merry Christmas’ to each other and not even know each other?” Freeman said. “You can get a ‘Merry Christmas’ from everybody. This is the same way.”","summary":"President Joe Biden made Juneteenth a federal holiday in 2021.","url":"https://www.twincities.com/2025/06/16/what-is-juneteenth/","image":"https://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Juneteenth_Explainer_57316.jpg?w=1024&h=683","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 17:03:02","author":"Associated Press","authors":["Associated Press"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.274},{"id":332045432,"title":"Supreme Court Takes Up Case of Pregnancy Center ‘Targeted’ By Democrat AG","text":"The Supreme Court Monday took up the case of a pro-life pregnancy center that claimed religious and political discrimination after New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, a Democrat, issued a subpoena demanding documents on the suspicion that the center had violated a consumer fraud law.\n\nLower courts had ruled that the pregnancy center, First Choice Women’s Resource with its headquarters in Morristown, must file its case in New Jersey courts, rather than federal court, because Platkin’s subpoena was “non-executing,” i.e., could only be enforced by a New Jersey court order. The Supreme Court will consider whether entities like First Choice must seek relief in state courts before they can petition federal courts.\n\n“New Jersey’s attorney general is targeting First Choice—a ministry that provides parenting classes, free ultrasounds, baby clothes, and more to its community—simply because of its pro-life views,” Erin Hawley, senior counsel at Alliance Defending Freedom, which is representing the pregnancy center, said in a statement after the court took up the case Monday. \n\n“The Constitution protects First Choice and its donors from unjustified demands to disclose their identities, and First Choice is entitled to vindicate those rights in federal court.”\n\nFirst Choice brought nine federal claims against Platkin, claiming that a Nov. 15, 2023, subpoena violated the First Amendment. \n\nThe subpoena cited the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act, the Charitable Registration and Investigation Act, and the attorney general’s investigative authority regarding professions and occupations, according to the initial complaint. The pregnancy center noted, however, that the subpoena “does not reflect the existence of a complaint, nor does it reflect any factual basis for suspecting a violation of the cited New Jersey laws.”\n\nThe subpoena demanded “a copy of every solicitation and advertisement,” “all documents physically or electronically provided to clients and/or donors, including intake forms, questionnaires, and pamphlets,” “documents sufficient to identify donations made to First Choice,” and more.\n\nThe subpoena focused on claims regarding the abortion pill reversal procedure. While pro-life pregnancy centers have launched hotlines to enable pregnant women who have taken abortion pills to order a reversal pill, pro-abortion activists argue that the reversal pills are unsafe. \n\nFirst Choice claimed that complying with the subpoena would “bury” the pregnancy center “in an inordinate amount of work,” while potential disclosure of donors and staff would chill support for the group “out of fear of retaliation and public exposure.”\n\nAmericans for Prosperity, a conservative nonprofit, filed an amicus brief urging the Supreme Court to take up the case. AFP and the Thomas More Law Center filed a lawsuit against then-California Attorney General Kamala Harris to block a required disclosure of donors. The Supreme Court upheld AFP’s right to donor confidentiality, ruling in AFP v. Bonta (2021)—named for Harris’ successor Rob Bonta—that California’s requirement violated the First Amendment.\n\nAccording to AFP, that Supreme Court precedent requires federal courts to take up First Choice’s case.\n\nPlatkin argued that the Supreme Court should not take up the case, arguing that the pregnancy center’s “constitutional challenge to a non-self-executing subpoena was not ripe for federal review.”\n\nPlatkin defended his subpoena, claiming that it came from concern “that certain nonprofit entities in New Jersey … may be misleading donors and potential clients regarding the health services they provide.”\n\nPlatkin noted that the subpoena is “not self-executing” and therefore “can only be enforced by a New Jersey state court.”\n\n“Although the state issued its subpoena in 2023, the state court has not required production of any documents—and has instead declined the state’s requests for such an order,” his brief notes. “Nonetheless, [First Choice] has repeatedly waged a collateral attack on the subpoena in federal court.”","summary":"The Supreme Court Monday took up the case of a pro-life pregnancy center that claimed religious and political discrimination after New Jersey Attorney General Matt...

In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday — expanding its recognition beyond Black America.This year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump's second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.Still, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.\"I don't think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,\" said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. \"I've not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.\"People who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a \"right\" way to celebrate Juneteenth?For beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:Is Juneteenth more of a solemn day of remembrance or a party?It depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as \"Black Codes,\" enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.Last year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.Plans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.Others may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\"The most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question 'What is Juneteenth?'\" Morial said.What if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn't learn about it until his 30s.\"I think many folks haven't known about it — who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn't celebrate it,\" Anderson said. \"It was like just a part of history. It wasn't a celebration of history.\"For many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn't have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.What kind of public Juneteenth events are taking place?Search online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnivalesque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you'll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There are also concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth's history.The National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.Are there special Juneteenth decorations or foods?The red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.More people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth's birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.Aside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.In recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.\"I would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,\" Morial said. \"If you got to participate in that (commercialism), that's what I would do.\"Does how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren't Black?Dr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there's no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you're not Black. In fact, embrace it.\"I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,\" Brown said. \"It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn't this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.\"What are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?Over the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\"Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we're celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,\" Brown said. \"Black people in America were still enslaved. So that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.\"Is there a proper Juneteenth greeting?It's typical to wish people a \"Happy Juneteenth\" or \"Happy Teenth,\" according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island.

Julie von Haefen of Wake County, advocating the decapitation of President Donald Trump, escalated Saturday into Sunday.\n\nOn social media, von Haefen is accused of posting an image of a woman holding signage with the image of a bloody, used guillotine; the words “In these difficult times, some cuts may be necessary”; and a prop on one end of the handle representing a beheaded Trump.\n\nMinutes after The Center Square sought authentication from her office, she posted to Facebook, “Yesterday, I posted a video on social media containing crowd photos from the No Kings protest in Raleigh. One of the images of a protestor holding a sign was inappropriate, and I later edited the video to remove the photo.\n\n“Let me be clear: I condemn political violence in all forms. My focus remains on bringing people together and fighting for the values that matter to North Carolinians. Like so many, I was horrified by the violence in Minnesota. There is no place for that kind of extremism in our democracy, no matter the target, no matter the party.”\n\nVon Haefen did not offer an apology.\n\nHer caption on Saturday morning said, “No Kings Protest in Raleigh. Amazing turnout all across the Triangle today, including this event at the Capitol hosted by Wake Democrats and North Carolina Democrats.” There were hashtags for an expletive, no kings and Raleigh.\n\nThe image, however, drew the criticism.\n\nHer actions Saturday morning is at odds with her midafternoon Sunday statement, as pointed out by many voters and other colleagues in the General Assembly. While the Facebook account associated with her campaign from last fall is active, her account on X does not exist anymore.\n\n“This is why reasonable people are leaving the Democrat Party in North Carolina,” said Rep. Erin Paré, a Wake County Republican. “This is a sitting state legislator who is publicly applauding the beheading of President Trump just hours after a state legislator in our country and her spouse were murdered in cold blood. Horrible.”\n\nThe North Carolina Republican Party on Sunday morning said, “Political violence should be condemned, not encouraged.”\n\nRep. Chris Humphrey, R-Lenoir, said, “Some people hate a duly elected leader, who won by landslide, more than they love America.”\n\nMidafternoon Sunday, first-term Democratic Gov. Josh Stein, Republican House Speaker Destin Hall of Caldwell County and Republican Senate President Pro Tempore Phil Berger had not commented publicly on von Haefen.\n\nVon Haefen, certified Guardian ad Litem according to her campaign website, first won election to the state House of Representatives in the 2018 midterms. She’s been reelected three times and touts her work with the parent teacher organizations at the school, county and state levels.\n\nShe’s licensed to practice law in Ohio, Arizona and California.\n\nThe North Carolina Democratic Party remained silent on von Haefen’s actions. About six hours after her post, the party chairwoman issued a statement about what happened in Minnesota on Saturday. There, a lawmaker and her husband were shot to death, and another lawmaker and his wife were injured in a shooting.\n\nOne man is being sought for both shootings.\n\n“We condemn these horrific acts and stand united against all forms of violence, especially those driven by political motives,” Chairwoman Anderson Clayton said. “Our hearts and thoughts are with the families as they navigate this unimaginable tragedy.”\n\nThe Wake County Republicans, in a statement shared with The Center Square, said in part, “Wake GOP is calling for the resignation of Rep. Julie von Haefen for promoting the beheading of President Trump on social media.\n\n“This kind of political hate has caused violence against elected officials across North Carolina and the country. So far there has been silence from North Carolina Democrats, the party which wins elections with lies and heated rhetoric. There is no place for political violence in this country, and we hope Wake and North Carolina Democrats will join us in the condemnation of these comments and demand von Haefen step down.”\n\nThe No Kings protests were held in rebuttal to Trump hosting a parade celebrating the Army’s 250th anniversary. More than 1,700 were scheduled, including 27 in the Tarheel State.\n\nFor context, and Republicans say irony, most of the protests Saturday were led by the party – Democrats – that was insistent on vaccine shots to retain federal jobs including the military; led the closure and slow reopening of schools during COVID-19; and held primaries for president last year only to welcome Kamala Harris and eventually Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as their ticket 107 days before the election.\n\nTrump won by more than 2 million votes, sweeping the seven swing states in electoral college votes 93-0.\n\nThis story originally appeared in The Center Square.","summary":"Claimed 'some cuts may be necessary' with image of guillotine","url":"https://www.wnd.com/2025/06/trump-beheading-post-by-state-lawmaker-prompts-calls-for-her-resignation/","image":"https://www.wnd.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/julie-von-haefen-trump-decapitated-jpg.jpeg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 15:00:09","author":"The Center Square","authors":["The Center Square"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.334},{"id":331970038,"title":"Washington Post Reporters Covering China Experience Email Hack","text":"A group of journalists at The Washington Post, responsible for covering China, experienced a breach in their email accounts.

LZ Granderson","text":"Heading into the final stretch of the 2024 election, it seemed every cable news program had a segment dedicated to one question: What will Black men do?\n\nProgressives on the ground were voicing concerns about the turnout of Black male voters long before the 2022 midterms. But because the overturning of Roe vs. Wade enabled Democrats to avoid a “red wave” then, the urgency on Black men was muted.\n\nThat quickly changed once former Vice President Kamala Harris became the presumptive nominee and media personalities such as Stephen A. Smith and Charlamagne tha God began questioning her qualifications without a hint of irony.\n\nIn the end, nearly 75% of Black men voted for Harris, and all of those cable news segments about the concerns of that voting bloc went away. That’s unfortunate because in many ways the question at the center of it all — “What will Black men do?” — is more relevant today than it was seven months ago.\n\nSince President Donald Trump has retaken office, federal civil rights offices have been gutted, grants for minority business programs canceled and the names of enslavers are making a comeback on military bases. Cable news may be waiting until the next election to talk about the concerns of Black men, but the Black community can’t wait that long. Khalil Thompson and Bakari Sellers agree.\n\nThe pair are part of the leadership team for Win With Black Men, a political advocacy group that began in 2022. Thompson said he was inspired to start the group by Win With Black Women, which started after the murder of George Floyd in 2020. Both organizations were key to jump-starting the enthusiasm for Harris, especially financially, with each raising millions of dollars within days of her campaign’s launch.\n\nNow, with the election behind us and three years of a hostile White House administration ahead of us, Thompson’s group has announced an 18-city listening tour starting in July to strategize about ways to help the community outside of the political system. The goal is to reach 3,500 Black men in person and an additional 25,000 through a national survey in hopes of building a database to better serve the community.\n\nThompson said it’s particularly important to keep people engaged now that the election is over because of how the White House continues to test the limits of both presidential power and the support from his party.\n\n“There has to be a moment where right is right,” said Thompson, a former operative for former President Barack Obama. “We raise our children to understand the basic tenets of being a good person. ... We need to build a system that can adequately accommodate and support the vast majority of people in this country who just want to enjoy this small amount of time we have on this planet. I see the protests happening and the raids and I’m reminded of Ruby Bridges or the lunch counter in Greensboro. What is happening now in our cities — ripping parents away from their children — doesn’t speak to our better angels.”\n\nSellers added: “Democracy is participatory, and a lot of time people forget that. The choices are to be on the sideline or get engaged — either way, you are involved.”\n\nHe made that choice at a young age, becoming the youngest Black person in elected state office across the country in 2006, as a 22-year-old state representative in South Carolina. His early social justice work echoes that of his father, Cleveland Sellers, who was part of the leadership for the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee during the civil rights movement.\n\n“I’d rather get in the fight, be knocked around a little bit, face terror head on, knowing I’m doing it for a just and righteous cause,” Sellers said.\n\nThompson said that in addition to engagement, Win With Black Men is looking to be a vessel for helping people financially with their utility and grocery bills, as the steep federal cuts and job losses threaten to send millions of Americans into poverty. The current fundraising goal is $2.5 million. And while the organization is nonpartisan, Sellers said a prominent Democrat is the unofficial North Star: “We need to get back to the politics of Jesse Jackson. Meet people where they are, focus on the working class and facilitate conversations that uplift people, not demean them.”\n\nFew things are more demeaning than feeling like your voice matters only once every four years. If nothing else, this upcoming listening tour is a reminder to Democrats that Black men are more than a vote.","summary":"Heading into the final stretch of the 2024 election, it seemed every cable news program had a segment dedicated to one question: What will Black men do?","url":"https://buffalonews.com/opinion/column/article_956442e3-e35c-565f-a714-549bd607d350.html","image":"https://bloximages.chicago2.vip.townnews.com/buffalonews.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/56/956442e3-e35c-565f-a714-549bd607d350/68500d11962da.preview.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 13:45:00","author":"Blox Content Management","authors":["Blox Content Management"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.238},{"id":331966736,"title":"Alta raises $11M to bring ‘Clueless’ fashion tech to life with all-star investors","text":"Throughout her years working in technology, Jenny Wang, 28, always found herself stumbling back to one idea — a personal styling agent to help users decide what to wear and buy based on their budget, lifestyle, weather and calendar. \n\nShe has tried to build such a product numerous times in the past, “but the AI technology was not yet mature enough,” she told TechCrunch. That’s changed so a few months ago she announced the launch of her dream company, Alta, followed by the announcement today of an $11 million seed round led by Menlo Ventures. \n\nThe product, which feels straight out of the movie “Clueless,” is indeed an AI stylist and personal shopper that makes outfit recommendations and lets users try on those looks with their personalized virtual avatar. For example, a person can ask Alta what the best outfit might be for, say, TechCrunch Disrupt, and the AI will offer suggestions and present a lookbook of outfits. \n\nUsers upload their closet by either taking photos, forwarding purchase receipts, or searching what is already in the Alta database. People can also dress themselves in clothes they are looking to buy, mixing and matching with clothes already in their closet. \n\nThere are others playing around in the AI styling space, such as Whering and Cladwell, all trying to recreate the magic of that iconic scene in “Clueless,” where Cher plans an outfit from her closet using computer technology. Want considers herself to be part of the new wave of consumer technology, looking to make styling and shopping more effective. \n\n“There are existing players like Google Shopping and Pinterest who are also experimenting with AI,” she continued. “But the experiences that consumers will crave and use in the future will need to be built with new technical architectures and new user interfaces.” \n\nThe product is backed by some heavy names, including Michelle Obama’s stylist Meredith Koop, who Wang said helped train Alta’s AI. \n\nOther investors in the company include Benchstrength; Algaé Ventures, the investment firm backed by fashion’s prestigious Arnault family of LVMH; Phenomenal Ventures, the firm founded by Kamala Harris’ niece Meena; Anthroptic’s VC arm Anthrology fund, and a slew of angel investors including Doordash CEO and co-founder Tony Xu, super models Jasmine Tooks and Karlie Kloss, Rent the Runway co-founder Jenny Fleiss, and Poshmark CEO and co-founder Manish Chandra. \n\nWang used the word “aligned” to describe her fundraising process and leaned heavily on the network she amassed while working in various tech roles throughout her career. She’s a Harvard engineer by training and has invested in numerous companies, served as a technical advisor to brands, and also held roles at investment firms. \n\nYears ago, for example, she was an intern at Doordash and previously volunteered on Karlie Kloss’ podcast “Kode with Klossy.” \n\n“I am still actively coding every day and learning from our team and technical advisors,” she said. \n\nWang said the fresh capital will be used to grow the team and fund more research and development. “Our team is continuously updating our in-house models and improving the experience based on community feedback,” she said. \n\nAlta has already struck a partnership with the Council of Fashion Designers of America (CFDA) to offer Alta to its membership base. Wang used to live in San Francisco but relocated to New York to help build out the technology. “NYC is also a closer flight to Paris than SF,” she said, adding that LVMH and one of her angel investors, tech influencer Zita d’Hautville, is helping the company expand throughout Europe. \n\nAlta is also working with Marie Kondo as the company also expands throughout parts of Oceania and the Pacific. \n\nThe plan is to next look at partnering with retailers worldwide. \n\n“Many of the most exciting consumer AI companies are being started in NYC,” Wang continued, adding that she’s assembled a highly technical but also fashion-obsessed team. This startup is her dream come true.","summary":"Throughout her years working in technology, Jenny Wang, 28, always found herself stumbling back to one idea — a personal styling agent to help users decide what to wear and buy based on their budget, lifestyle, weather and calendar.&#160; She has tried to build such a product numerous times in the past, “but the AI [&#8230;]","url":"https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/16/alta-raises-11m-to-bring-clueless-fashion-tech-to-life-with-all-star-investors/","image":"https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Jenny-TC.png?resize=1200,800","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 13:00:00","author":"Dominic-Madori Davis","authors":["Dominic-Madori Davis"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.308},{"id":331948476,"title":"Despite growing anger, Trump marches on with his projections of power","text":"There was nothing wrong with the idea that America might want a 250th anniversary celebration of the US Army. The celebration that US President Donald Trump finally got after pushing for it since his first term could have been billed as a front-running event connected to the country’s 250th birthday, since we are almost one year away from that significant date.\nAnd for those longing for a break from the blood sport that US politics has become, the event did not end up as Trumpian as might have been expected. Although the president was positioned between two tanks on his reviewing stand – a set piece that made him appear as the central figure – he still managed to get through his speech without repeating election lies or lashing out at his political enemies. A gold star for him.\nBeginning with a historically costumed fife and drum corps and then continuing through the eras of battle machinery, the presentation did not veer into political territory unless you were watching on Fox News, where Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth offered commentary including: “The haters can hate. Let them. We don’t care.”\nThe Trump-friendly Newsmax offered up commentary that would make North Korean leader Kim Jong-un blush. Meanwhile, major broadcast media such as CNN toggled between images of the parade and the millions of Americans at “No Kings” demonstrations that proceeded from Bucksport, Maine to Los Angeles, where police used tear gas and flash bangs to disperse protesters.\nThe nationwide demonstrations knocked the parade off the top headlines. A shooting during a march in Salt Lake City that left one person critically injured pushed Trump’s event further below the fold.\nThe president must have known in the run-up to the parade how large and widespread the protests against him were shaping up to be. If he didn’t, the political assassination of Minnesota lawmaker Melissa Hortman and her husband, which Minnesota Governor Tim Walz called an act of “targeted political violence”, should have given him the message that the nation needed a salve.\n\nTrump was gracious enough – or more likely convinced by the less extreme among his advisers – to send a statement condemning the deadly violence after news of the killing broke. But if he truly wanted to bring the temperature down, Trump would have used a moment of his speech – while framed by so many symbols of authority, including the White House in the background – to acknowledge the assassination and call for unity.\nHe did not. That is because Trump wants nothing to interfere with his projection of power, despite the obvious signs that anger among Americans towards his policies is growing.\nA new Quinnipiac University poll shows most Americans oppose his actions on immigration and deportations, with 54 per cent of registered voters disapproving of “the way Donald Trump is handling immigration issues” and only 43 per cent in favour. Given that his strongest suit poll-wise has long been immigration, this should set off alarms in the Oval Office.\n\nMost Americans were weary of inflation last year, and this is what gave Trump 49.8 per cent of the popular vote in November to Kamala Harris’ 48.3 per cent – a victory but by no means a landslide or a strong mandate. Republicans would be foolish to see how fervent the “No Kings” sentiment has grown and think this winning margin would hold if another election was held this week.\nBut the political brand Trump and his allies have built is brittle. It does not allow for anything in the way of consensus that involves Democrats or even moderates in his own party. Any such move risks alienating a base that feeds exclusively on red meat, so he will forge ahead with an agenda meant to divide the country and fulfil the authoritarian plans laid out in Project 2025.\nAnd on the subject of authoritarianism, it should be understood that Saturday’s parade was not, as some Chinese state media have declared, representative of an America in decline. If anything, US leadership under Trump has become more like China’s as Trump tries to force all of America’s institutions to bend to his ideological will, cracks down on dissent and makes excuses for Russian President Vladimir Putin and other autocratic governments. If these tendencies have tipped the US into decline, China faces the same risk.\n\nThe more precise assessment is that until recently, the US had both a strong economy and robust alliances that left Beijing little room to manoeuvre geostrategically. The political mayhem that Trump has unleashed on all of the institutions that provide checks and balances has put the country on a knife’s edge.\nMost Americans want what made their country powerful and attractive, including the rule of law and an aversion to autocracy. This could bring the US back from the brink.","summary":"There was nothing wrong with the idea that America might want a 250th anniversary celebration of the US Army.

The high-profile case unveiled so many dark secrets, including how the rapper abused his ex-girlfriends. Since the tension began last year, many A-list celebrities have spoken up against him. However, some kept tight-lipped, refusing to get caught up in the drama. One such individual is none other than Kamala Harris.\n\nWhile many are unsure about her reasons, many believe that she might have wanted to divert attention from her past involvement with Diddy. As reported by Nicki Swift, the former Vice President had a text exchange with the controversial rapper back in October 2020.\n\nThe messages were revealed after Combs was arrested by the authorities.\n\nAccording to the outlet, Harris tweeted, “Thank you, @Diddy, for hosting this town hall last night. There’s a lot at stake for our communities right now, and it’s critical we bring to the forefront how coronavirus is perpetuating racial inequality and health disparities.”\n\nAs the case further evolved, the internet wasted no time discussing the matter, and Kamala soon became the subject of yet another brutal trolling. One X user remarked, “You are a real freak.” The person was likely referring to the rapper’s infamous “freak offs.”\n\nAnother demanded that her involvement with the rap mogul should be investigated by authorities. A third joked under Harris’s tweet, “Did you bring the baby oil?”\n\nSurprisingly, the former Vice President felt no need to remove the post from her X account. Instead, she just left it like that.\n\n🚨🇺🇸 FACT CHECK: KAMALA HARRIS’ CONNECTION TO DIDDY UNDER SCRUTINY\nAfter Diddy’s indictment on sex trafficking charges, social media users unearthed a 2020 tweet from Kamala thanking him for hosting a town hall.@KamalaHarris :\n“Thank you, @Diddy, for hosting this town hall… pic.twitter.com/sLInpZmrO8\n— Alex Kennedy (@AlexkennedyIran) September 24, 2024 \n\nThis tweet revelation came not too long after an alleged photo of Kamala Harris and Diddy together made rounds on the internet. Many online users claimed that she had spent a great amount of time at the Bad Boy Records founder’s party.\n\nOne person on X even alleged that her team pursued extreme lengths to have the photos of them wiped out. “Kamala’s team has spent more than $5 million having images of her with Sean P Diddy Combs bleached from the internet. It would be such a shame if this made the rounds.”\n\nHowever, as reported by Nicki Swift, after a thorough fact-check, it was clarified that the image was, in fact, photoshopped. In the picture, it was actually Misa Hylton with Diddy, but Harris’s photo was likely digitally added after removing the other woman.\n\nIt looks like Kamala Harris had a great time at a Diddy party. pic.twitter.com/aXQgHpcJ5e\n— 𝔉🅰𝒏 Karoline Leavitt (@WHLeavitt) June 5, 2025 \n\nMeanwhile, an alleged Diddy court document also became a subject of discussions on the internet. Her name allegedly popped on the doc, along with many others who attended Combs’ party.\n\nDespite the controversy, it can’t be confirmed whether Kamala was truly involved with the disgraced rapped. Rest assured, she is not the only high-profile politician who got embroiled in the row.

Paid by whom. It was obvious he was blaming the liberals or the democrats. The Day was also marred by the assassination of two of Minnesota’s popular legislators who were gunned down and two others attacked in a dastardly fashion that a nationwide hunt is on for the 54-year-old man said to have been wearing military fatigues.\n\nMinnesota’s governor Tim Walz, last years’ running mate of democratic presidential candidate Ms. Kamala Harris, publicly mourned the death of the legislators. With the people of Minneapolis and St Louis, the twin cities, Vice President JD Vance sent his condolences promising any support in apprehending the criminal, Trump was yet to react to the incident.\n\nBack to the military tattoo, hard rock from Metallica and Led Zeppelin blared on loudspeakers, more than 6,000 soldiers marched by spectators including Trump and first lady Melania Trump, who watched from a stage with the White House visible behind them as the president celebrated his 79th birthday.\n\n“The Army keeps us free to make us strong,” Trump said in his remarks that came at the conclusion of the parade and a short concert and before a fireworks display. “And tonight, you have all Americans very proud.” But many retired army officers said it was not necessary the two events had to coincide. They could have been held separately.\n\nTrump saluted soldiers dressed in World War II-era uniforms and applauded throughout as soldiers with machine guns, M1 Abrams tanks and howitzer cannons made their way past his stage, while parachuters jumped from planes above.\n\nTrump’s parade produced a dramatic split screen as millions of Americans attended coordinated “No Kings” marches in cities across the country in protest of Trump and his administration. It also came on the same day that two Minnesota state lawmakers were shot – with one killed alongside her husband – in a pair of politically-motivated attacks from a gunman still on the loose. Both lawmakers were members of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labour Party.\n\nBack in Washington, it was not immediately clear how many people attended the event at the National Mall, which was the first military parade in the nation’s capital since the end of the Gulf War in 1991. But it appeared to be vastly fewer than the 200,000 who had been expected, perhaps a result of the threat of rain looming in the evening forecast. The long stretch of pathway from the Lincoln memorial to the Capitol hill is described as the national mall or the Washington Mall, it’s not a shopping mall.\n\nThe parade, which was projected to cost $40 million in taxpayer dollars, started 30 minutes earlier than scheduled. A 21-gun salute and a performance of “Hail to the Chief” welcomed the president and first lady before the parade began with the Old Guard Fife and Drum Corps, depicting the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.\n\nOn stage, Trump was also joined by Vice President JD Vance, members of his Cabinet including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Republican lawmakers such as Rep. Marjorie Taylore Greene, R-Georgia.\n\nA massive fireworks display over the National Mall concluded Trump’s military parade as the president and first lady watched from their stage. Speakers hailing the virtues of U.S. soldiers played over loudspeakers as the fireworks blasted from near the Washington Monument – mimicking the city’s Fourth of July celebration that will comes in less than one month. The soundtrack for the fireworks also included several American anthems including “America the Beautiful.”\n\nTrump hailed the U.S. Army as the “fiercest and bravest fighting force ever to stride the face of the earth” and commended soldiers who have fought and died for the country in patriotic-themed remarks after the parade concluded. “The Army keeps us free to make us strong. And tonight, you have all American very proud,” Trump said in a seven-minute speech. “Every other country celebrates their victories. It’s about time America did, too.”\n\nTrump traced U.S. military operations from the Continental Army in the Revolutionary War to the Civil War, and from World War I and II into the modern times. “Our soldiers never give up, never surrender and never give up. They fight, fight, fight,” he said, echoing what became one of his slogans after he escaped an assassination attempt in the 2024 election.\n\nTrump said there is “no earthly force more powerful than” an Army soldier, before pointing to the sacrifices of the army. “Our soldiers have poured their blood out by the bucket load.” “Thanks to their extraordinary service and devotion, 250 years later, America stands tall, America stands proud, and America stands free,” he said. “We’re the hottest country in the world right now. Our country will soon be greater and stronger than ever before.”\n\nVice President JD Vance noted June 14 is also his wedding anniversary during his remarks introducing Trump. After finishing his speech, Trump and Melania Trump were handed a folded American flag by an officer before singer Lee Greenwood performed “God Bless the USA.” A fireworks display in front of the Washington Monument then erupted.\n\nNot only did the military parade fall on Trump’s birthday. It also coincided with Vice President JD Vance’s 11th wedding anniversary with second lady Usha Vance. “Happy birthday, Mr. President,” Vance said as he introduced Trump before the president’s remarks. “But I would get in trouble if I didn’t mention that it’s also my wedding anniversary. And so, to my lovely wife: I love you, honey.” (IPA Service)","summary":"By T N Ashok WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump celebrated his 79th birthday in June 14, Saturday with much pomp and fanfare befitting only emperors and kings as Heavy tanks, armoured vehicles and thousands of soldiers showcasing all military eras marked the 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army that coincided with his birthday as he [&#8230;]","url":"https://ipanewspack.com/massive-protest-rallies-against-trump-overshadow-his-birthday-and-army-day-festivities/","image":"https://ipanewspack.com/whoaftuf/2025/06/massive-protest-rallies-against-trump-overshadow-his-birthday-and-army-day-festivities.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 10:58:18","author":"IPA Staff","authors":["IPA Staff"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"in","sentiment":-0.037},{"id":331900148,"title":"Hillary Clinton’s Effort to Mock Donald Trump Doesn’t Go as Planned","text":"Hillary Clinton’s attempt at mocking Donald Trump’s ‘Dear Leader parade’ backfired when she likened the president’s military celebration to the ‘No Kings’ protests led by liberals nationwide. \n\nDespite some rain as he and first lady Melania Trump arrived at Saturday’s 250th anniversary of the U.S. Army, the skies over Washington, D.C., remained clear enough for flyovers, parachute jumps, and an impressive fireworks show.\n\nTrump’s former presidential opponent couldn’t resist comparing the parade—which provoked intense discussions over turnout—to the bustling ‘No Kings Day’ rallies held in cities with liberal-leaning populations. \n\n‘Compare and contrast scenes from yesterday in America. On the one hand, Trump’s low-energy Dear Leader parade (that cost you $45 million). On the other, millions of people across the country gathering peacefully to say: Here, we have no kings,’ she captioned photos from the DC parade and a Los Angeles protest.\n\nWhile the post received agreements from the ex-secretary of state’s fellow liberals, she was walloped by much of social media, especially when she once again turned off the ability to reply to her tweet. \n\n‘Hillary Clinton hates the troops, bigtime,’ wrote Eric Daughtery. \n\nTravis Parsley went a step further: ‘Hillary Clinton hates everything about America!’\n\nOne commenter asked: ‘Do you think Hillary hates our military?’\n\nSeveral responded by bringing up one of the most famous scandals she faced as head of the State Department for Barack Obama. \n\n‘Yes !! Remember Benghazi,’ answered one. \n\nRepublicans claimed in 2016 that the Obama White House and Clinton lied repeatedly to the American people about the nature of and reasons for the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, even as they privately acknowledged what caused them. \n\nThe GOP members of the House Benghazi committee issued their 800 page report with excoriating words for her and the president, accusing her of ‘shameful’ conduct over her secret email account, and the White House of lying about what caused the attacks.\n\nHer ‘homebrew’ server was only revealed because of the investigation into the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.\n\nAnother social media user pointed out that Clinton holds a deep hatred of anyone sympathetic to the president. \n\n‘She hates our country. We are deplorables.’\n\nDuring a fundraiser on her failed 2016 campaign, she had called half of Trump’s supporters racist, homophobic, sexist, xenophobic, or Islamophobic and said they belonged in a ‘basket of deplorables’. \n\nClinton later backtracked on her comments saying she regrets half of her remarks, after admitting she was ‘grossly generalistic’ in what she said at the LGBT event in New York, adding ‘that’s never a good idea’.\n\nStill others said that Clinton simply couldn’t take the heat and locked up the replies to her post. \n\nOne wrote: ‘Turn on your replies or put down the phone!’ \n\nSome of Clinton’s supporters still had her back in response to the post trashing Trump.\n\nJennifer Vallez wrote: ‘And no one needed to pay us to protest. We hate him for free! #powertothepeople’\n\n‘I love you so much for doing this, Hillary!!! The shade of it all!’ added another. \n\nSeveral even wrote in doubt of the legitimacy of Trump’s election victory, with one suggesting they ‘prove it’ that Kamala Harris won in November.\n\nUltimately, President Trump got the birthday present he had been hoping for – good weather. \n\nDespite several drops of rain falling as he and first lady Melania Trump arrived at Saturday’s 250th anniversary for the U.S. Army, Washington, D.C.’s skies stayed clear enough for flyovers, parachute jumps and a grand fireworks display. \n\nThe president spoke for an uncharacteristically short eight minutes, but in doing so delivered a stern warning to America’s enemies. \n\n‘There is no earthly force more powerful than the brave heart of the U.S. military or an Army Ranger paratrooper or Green Beret,’ he told the crowd, sprawled far out onto the National Mall surrounding the Washington Monument. \n\nThere were fears ahead of Saturday’s event, which coincided with Trump’s 79th birthday, that the evening parade would have to be postponed or scrapped if there was lightning in the area. \n\nThe only lightning and thunder at the event was during country crooner Warren Zeiders’ performance and when AC/DC’s Thunderstruck played. \n\nAhead of the event there were also worries about protests. \n\nWhile some of the ‘No Kings’ demonstrations around the country turned chaotic – including an incident with a man driving into a crowd – on the Mall there were only a smattering of critics – some quietly holding signs, others more loudly heckling the president’s MAGA fans. \n\nThe president and first lady arrived at a viewing box where the Ellipse meets Constitution Avenue, with Melania sporting a cream pinstripe suit for the occasion.\n\nAfter the Star-Spangled banner, when there was a break in the programming, members of the crowd loudly broke out into ‘Happy Birthday’ for Trump. \n\nTrump’s family members were also on hand – Donald Trump Jr., with girlfriend Bettina Anderson, Eric Trump with wife Lara, as well as Tiffany Trump – who gave birth last month to her first child.\n\nDana White, the Trump pal and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO, scored a prime seat to the parade. \n\nSusie Wiles, the White House Chief of Staff, sat in the second row wearing a large pair of reflective sunglasses. \n\nThe parade showcased the history of the Army, with the earliest period uniforms going first. \n\nWhile the president is used to packed crowds for his rallies, the attendance for Saturday’s parade wasn’t overwhelming.\n\nAttendees had plenty of space on the National Mall to spread out. \n\nThe VIP bleachers located across from the press section were barely full.\n\nLines did stretch dozens of people deep for the food trucks that had been allowed on the National Mall.\n\nThere were handfuls of protesters, but most sat quietly while holding their signs. \n\nThe evening ended with a grand fireworks display over the National Mall, which was timed to a number of patriotic songs.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nHillary Clinton&#8217;s attempt at mocking Donald Trump&#8217;s &#8216;Dear Leader parade&#8217; backfired when&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Hillary Clinton&#8217;s Effort to Mock Donald Trump Doesn&#8217;t Go as Planned first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/hillary-clintons-effort-to-mock-donald-trump-doesnt-go-as-planned/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Hillary-Clintons-attempt-to-troll-Donald-Trump-backfires.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 10:33:01","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.381},{"id":331903788,"title":"Dem strategist behind racy attack ads says party doesn't need liberal Rogan but does need to win the culture","text":"Democrats don’t need a liberal version of Joe Rogan to win back young male voters — but they do need to engage them on cultural battlegrounds, according to progressive strategist Joe Jacobson. \"Young men, they don’t give two s---- about politics,\" Jacobson, founder of the Progress Action Fund, told Fox News Digital. \"You have to reach them where they’re at.\" Jacobson, 31, a former policy adviser in the Obama administration, now runs a progressive PAC focused on electing Democrats in swing states. His group is part of a broader push to reclaim younger male voters, a demographic that swung significantly toward Donald Trump in the 2024 election. According to a Fox News Voter Survey last November, Trump captured 53% of young men, compared to Kamala Harris’ 45%. The Progress Action Fund has gained attention for its risqué, viral ads featuring a fictional \"Republican Congressman\" who invades private moments in bedrooms, bathrooms and hospitals to enforce so-called conservative policies, such as stopping sex, abortion or denying care to Medicare patients. CNN HOST WARNS DEMS MUST ACTUALLY 'GET RID OF SOME SACRED COWS' OF FAR-LEFT IDEOLOGY, NOT JUST TALK ABOUT IT \"We’re trying to highlight issues we care about – whether it's trans issues or immigration – because Democrats don’t really seem to have a message,\" Jacobson said. He argues that Democrats have a dual problem: weak messaging and unrelatable messengers. \"Kamala Harris wasn’t the best messenger for young men. Biden, in 2024, was old – to say the least,\" he said. \"Young men want strong leaders who can get s--- done. It’s hard to care about the fate of democracy when you’ve got a couple of roommates, and you’re trying to find a girlfriend.\" Instead of chasing a high-profile influencer like Rogan, Jacobson says Democrats should amplify authentic, progressive voices, naming David Hogg and Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., as figures he believes are more relevant to young men than the party’s aging leadership. DEMS DROP $20M ON BIZARRE 'AMERICAN MEN' STRATEGY PLAN STUDY IN EFFORT TO DIG OUT OF 2024 POLITICAL HOLE Jacobson’s group is working to raise $25 million to target young men ahead of the 2026 midterms through ads on gaming sites and social media. He says traditional cable news buys on \"CNN or MSNBC\" are great for getting out the base but don't reach young men, who are more interested in social media, gaming and sports. Trump’s 2024 media strategy capitalized on digital outreach, with Trump appearing with popular podcast hosts like Rogan, Andrew Schulz, and Theo Von. His appearance on the \"Joe Rogan Experience\" days before the election racked up nearly 40 million views in just three days. Jacobson’s message comes amid broader Democratic efforts to regain cultural relevance online. Liberal strategists are urging major donors to fund \"an army of left-leaning online influencers\" to rival the GOP’s edge in digital influence, according to the report. The Times called it a bold – and possibly desperate – gamble, noting that platforms like Rogan’s podcast weren’t built overnight or by political operatives. DEMOCRATS REEXAMINE THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA GAME AFTER LOSING TO TRUMP: NOT 'DIRECT' OR 'AUTHENTIC' While Jacobson emphasized the need for compelling messengers, he also says Democrats must offer bold policies on the economy and social issues. \"Nobody really cares about the future of democracy if you can’t afford the rent,\" he said. He urged his party to stop surrendering on cultural issues and start fighting back, pointing to how effective Trump’s \"Kamala is for they/them, Trump is for you\" ad was during the 2024 campaign. His group will be releasing a new ad featuring their fictional Republican character doing bathroom checks in response to the transgender debate, and another hitting Republicans over ICE raids.

We just have to get back to what made us successful.\"","summary":"Democrats need relatable messengers and content targeting young men where they are, on gaming sites and social media, not a liberal Joe Rogan, says strategist Joe Jacobson.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/media/dem-strategist-behind-racy-attack-ads-says-party-doesnt-need-rogan-does-need-win-culture","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2025/05/931/523/rogansplit2.png?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 10:00:49","author":"Kristine Parks","authors":["Kristine Parks"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":332005236,"title":"Here are some of the Texas Democrats eyeing statewide runs in 2026","text":"Sign up for The Brief, The Texas Tribune’s daily newsletter that keeps readers up to speed on the most essential Texas news.\n\nWith the legislative session over, Texas Democrats are turning their attention to the 2026 elections for the state’s most powerful offices — with the hope that midterm backlash against the Trump administration will help the party reverse course from its recent blowout losses and snap a three-decade losing streak.\n\nMore than a dozen statewide offices will appear on next year’s ballot, including governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general, in addition to one of Texas’ two U.S. Senate seats. The comptroller, land and agriculture commissioners, and several statewide judicial seats are also up for reelection.\n\nTexas Democrats have struggled to mount competitive statewide campaigns since 2018, when Democrat Beto O’Rourke fell just short of unseating U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz in what would have been the party’s first statewide win since 1994. Their optimism has since been dashed by a failed push to flip the Texas House in 2020, O’Rourke’s double-digit loss to Gov. Greg Abbott in 2022 and a 2024 cycle that saw President Donald Trump carry Texas by 14 percentage points and Cruz win reelection by more than triple his 2018 margin.\n\nBut Democrats smell an opportunity to finally break through next year, the first midterm under Trump since their near-miss six years ago. Also fueling Democratic hopes is the prospect of Attorney General Ken Paxton, the hardline standard-bearer who has endured numerous scandals, leading the ballot if he topples incumbent U.S. Sen. John Cornyn in the GOP primary.\n\nAt least six rising or already prominent Democrats have seen their names floated for one of the top four statewide offices — a pileup of potential candidates that is poised to come into focus over the next few months, with Democrats hoping to present a full, cohesive slate of candidates who can take on the Trump administration, message effectively against Republicans, fundraise and blanket the state ahead of the election.\n\nSeveral are looking closely at the Senate race and the chance to run against Paxton, who has led Cornyn by a wide margin in early polls. Those considering a run include two statewide campaign veterans: O’Rourke and former U.S. Rep. Colin Allred, who lost to Cruz last year by 8.5 points while overperforming the top of the ticket. Also in the mix are U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro of San Antonio and state Rep. James Talarico of Austin.\n\nO’Rourke has hosted several town halls around the state in recent months, including in Republican congressional districts, and said in April he would run for Senate “if” Texans want him to.\n\nIn a statement, he continued to leave open the possibility of a statewide run, saying, “With so many of our neighbors and families being hurt right now, I’ll continue standing up for the people of Texas — whether that’s holding these town hall meetings, organizing and registering voters or running to serve and deliver for every person in this state.”\n\nA prodigious fundraiser with high name ID, O’Rourke would also enter the race with clear political baggage, after losing two statewide campaigns and failing to catch fire in a 2019 presidential run, during which he staked out numerous progressive stances that stymied his appeal to right-leaning moderates when running for governor.\n\nAllred, a Dallas Democrat and former NFL linebacker who was endorsed by Republican U.S. Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, has also said he is “seriously considering” another Senate run and would make a decision this summer.\n\nThough Allred was criticized by some Democrats for not running aggressively enough last year, he outpaced then-Vice President Kamala Harris’ margin atop the ticket by more than 5 percentage points. In a June interview on the Dallas-based Lone Star Politics show, Allred said he would run “differently” this time around, now that he’s out of Congress.\n\nA May poll by Texas Southern University found that 45% of voters had a favorable opinion of Allred, the highest proportion of the six potential Senate candidates surveyed.\n\n“I’m looking at it and seriously considering it,” Allred told the Dallas Morning News in March. “This is a time for everybody to realize just what’s at stake and how important it is that we all stay involved.”\n\nWhile Allred and O’Rourke are widely known from their previous statewide bids, Castro and Talarico would start from scratch among most voters outside their districts.\n\nTalarico, a seminarian and former public school teacher with a frequently viral social media presence, spent much of the legislative session creating moments of contrast with Republicans on issues like school vouchers and displaying the Ten Commandments in public school classrooms. He is often described as one of Texas Democrats’ strongest communicators.\n\n“I’m having conversations about how I can best serve Texas, and that includes the Senate race,” Talarico, who declined to comment for this story, told POLITICO this month. “But in my training as a pastor, you learn the importance of listening and how hard it is to truly listen. With so much at stake for Texas, I’m trying to listen more than I talk right now.”\n\nCastro, who has represented his San Antonio-based district in Congress since 2013 after serving 10 years in the Texas House, has spoken to donors and party experts in recent months about the Senate race while holding town halls in both red and blue districts across the state.\n\nHe was tapped in 2021 by then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to help build the case against Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the Capitol for the president’s second impeachment.\n\nSan Antonio Mayor Ron Nirenberg, who is term-limited after this year, has also seen his name thrown in the mix for Senate or to take on Abbott or Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, though he has emphasized a focus on closing out his tenure and ensuring a smooth transition to the next mayor, Gina Ortiz Jones, over the next few weeks. He has not said anything publicly about his 2026 aspirations.\n\nMost of the would-be Democratic candidates have voiced interest in the U.S. Senate race, with little chatter about who will step forward for the tall order of challenging Abbott, who has walloped all three Democratic gubernatorial candidates he has faced and established himself as the most prolific political fundraiser in Texas history.\n\nFurther down the ballot, the attorney general post will be open for the first time since 2014 as Paxton leaves office to pursue his Senate bid. And Comptroller Glenn Hegar is departing at the end of the month to become chancellor of the Texas A&M University System, meaning the comptroller seat will either be open or defended by an unelected incumbent, depending on whether Hegar’s Abbott-appointed successor decides to seek a full term.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Nathan Johnson, a Dallas lawyer, is circling a likely run for attorney general, though he said that he had yet to make a final decision and had received encouragement to run for governor, lieutenant governor and comptroller.\n\n“When I do decide, it will be a calculation of where I think I could be most useful, both from the standpoint of electoral viability and service in the office,” said Johnson, who can run without giving up his Senate seat.\n\nTwo Republicans have already launched campaigns to succeed Paxton on the GOP ballot: state Sen. Mayes Middleton of Galveston and former Paxton aide and Department of Justice Trump appointee Aaron Reitz.\n\nCandidates in both parties have until early December to file for the 2026 ballot, though the scope of who is running for which office will likely shake out well before then, with candidates looking to have enough runway to build up their campaign war chests and start introducing themselves to voters. Allred, for instance, launched his Senate campaign in May 2023, and O’Rourke got into the Senate race against Cruz in March 2017.\n\n“There’s a funneling effect, and we’re near the bottom of the funnel now,” Johnson said, adding that there were discussions about “what might it look like if different people run in different places.”\n\n“I'm thinking of this in terms of a functioning machine with different parts,” he added. “If we have everybody vying to play one single part, the machine’s not going to work.”\n\nState Rep. Vikki Goodwin of Austin has already announced her bid for lieutenant governor, giving up her safe Texas House seat to take on Patrick, the three-term Republican with more than $33 million in campaign funds and no shortage of conservative support.\n\nAnd while Abbott maintains a solid 44% approval rating — slightly better than where he stood at the same point four years ago, according to the Texas Politics Project — he is under pressure to veto an unpopular ban on THC products spearheaded by Patrick and approved by the Legislature this session. Democrats hope his next move could create an opening for them, though political experts say that issue alone is unlikely to pose a serious political threat.\n\n“A lot of the headwinds that have limited Democrats’ chances in the past couple of elections have at least reduced, if not blown themselves out,” Johnson contended. “We’re going to have a highly qualified array of candidates running for a variety of offices, and you will see an additive effect that I don’t think Texas has seen in several cycles.”\n\nDisclosure: Politico, Texas A&M University, Texas Southern University - Barbara Jordan-Mickey Leland School of Public Affairs and Texas A&M University System have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

All FAQs answered","text":"Juneteenth is observed every year on June 19 to commemorate the end of slavery in the United States and is a federal holiday in the US. The day honours those who suffered as a result of slavery in the 400 years since the first enslaved Africans arrived in the colonies, which later became the US.Juneteenth was designated as a federal holiday under the Biden administration in 2021- expanding its recognition beyond Black America. This is the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump's second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognising other racial heritage celebrations.How will be Juneteenth celebrated in the US?For Juneteenth, many people in the US are expecting to look forward to a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honour it, reports news agency AP.“I don't think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League “I've not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.” All FAQs on Juneteenth answered:Is Juneteenth more of a solemn day of remembrance or a party?Actually, it depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans' true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated.Last year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.ALSO READ: Is Pentagon planning to invade Greenland and Panama? Pete Hegseth's remarks raise serious concernsWhat is this year's plan?Plans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office. Others may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.What if you've never celebrated Juneteenth?Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global—a consulting firm that helps leaders navigate conversations around race and culture—didn’t grow up observing Juneteenth. In fact, he didn’t learn about the holiday until he was in his 30s.“I think a lot of people, even African Americans like myself, simply didn’t know about it,” Anderson said. “And even if you had heard of it, you didn’t really celebrate it. It was just a historical fact—not something we marked with festivities.”For many Black Americans, particularly those raised farther from Texas, large-scale Juneteenth celebrations were uncommon. In the South, the observance often depended on when news of the Emancipation Proclamation actually reached each state. What types of public Juneteenth events are happening?A quick online search reveals a wide variety of Juneteenth events across the country, ranging in size and style. Some celebrations take the form of vibrant festivals, complete with food trucks, arts and crafts, parades, and live entertainment. Within these festivals, you’ll often find booths offering health care information, financial advice, and community resources. Many also include concerts, fashion shows showcasing Black creativity, and educational panels on the history of Juneteenth.In honor of the holiday, the National Park Service is offering free admission to all its sites, according to its website.ALSO READ: Kim Kardashian's post on ICE raids draws DHS ire: ‘Which one of these convicted child molesters would you like to stay?’ Are there traditional Juneteenth decorations or foods?The Pan-African flag — red, black, and green — is commonly displayed during both Black History Month and Juneteenth. Red represents the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors; black symbolizes the people; and green signifies the rich lands of Africa.In recent years, more people have embraced the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith. This red, white, and blue flag reflects the American identity of the newly freed people. A five-point star at the center represents Texas, where Juneteenth originated, and is surrounded by a white outline symbolizing the spread of freedom across the country.When it comes to food, red remains a central theme — a symbolic nod to the ancestors' sacrifice. Traditional Juneteenth dishes may include barbecue (especially ribs), red meats, watermelon, and red velvet cake. Drinks such as fruit punch or red Kool-Aid are also common.Has Juneteenth become commercialized?In recent years, major retailers have begun selling Juneteenth-themed merchandise, from party supplies to T-shirts. However, this year such items appear to be less visible in stores and more often available only online. Marc Morial, a civic leader, says he hopes businesses haven’t backed away from Juneteenth products due to political concerns. He encourages consumers to support Black-owned businesses instead.“If you’re going to take part in that commercial aspect, find an African American vendor online,” Morial advised.ALSO READ: Trump calls Israel’s strike on Iran 'excellent', says 'there’s more to come'Can non-Black people celebrate Juneteenth?Absolutely, says Dr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University who studies race. She encourages everyone — regardless of race — to acknowledge and celebrate Juneteenth.“Don’t feel awkward if you want to engage with Juneteenth,” Brown said. “It is your history. This is part of the broader American story — the struggle, the progress, and the promise of freedom.”ALSO READ: Friday 13th is here: Why people think it's unlucky and what's the mystery behind it?Are there other names for Juneteenth?Yes — Juneteenth has also been known as Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Independence Day, and the second Fourth of July.“July 4, 1776, didn't mean freedom for Black Americans,” Brown pointed out. “While the nation was celebrating liberty, my ancestors were still enslaved. That’s why Juneteenth carries special significance.”Is there a traditional Juneteenth greeting?Yes! Much like “Merry Christmas,” people commonly greet one another with “Happy Juneteenth” or “Happy Teenth.” Comedian Alan Freeman, who is organizing Juneteenth shows in Galveston and Houston, encourages the casual use of the greeting:“People wish each other a ‘Merry Christmas’ even if they’re strangers. Juneteenth should be the same — warm, welcoming, and shared.”(With inputs from AP)","summary":"Juneteenth, commemorating the end of slavery in the US, is observed with festivals and events, though the current political climate raises concerns about its recognition.

On one side would be a spectacle of military might, on the other a display of peaceful mass protest against government overreach.\n\nBut what began as a split screen became more of a kaleidoscope, a window into a fractured nation that’s been beset by political unrest, feuding, and even violence.\n\nAhead of Saturday’s parade and demonstrations, tensions had already spiked over Mr. Trump’s deployment of National Guard troops in Los Angeles against the wishes of the governor, amid protests over federal immigration raids. On Thursday, a federal judge in California ruled that the deployment was unconstitutional, a decision immediately stayed by an appeals court. That same day, Democratic Sen. Alex Padilla of California was forcibly removed when he interrupted a press event in Los Angeles featuring Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem. The incident sparked outrage and finger pointing across the aisle in California and Washington.\n\nThen on Saturday, as tanks and troops prepared to roll through the nation’s capital, news broke of the early morning slaying of a Democratic state lawmaker and her husband in Minnesota and the attempted killing of another Democratic lawmaker and his wife, eight miles away. On Sunday night, the alleged gunman was caught after a manhunt. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz called the shootings political assassinations.\n\nFor historians, this fraught moment has the hallmarks of past cycles of U.S. political conflict and contestations over the legitimacy of street protest.\n\n“None of this is particularly new,” says Ellen Fitzpatrick, a history professor at the University of New Hampshire. What is new, though, is the pattern set by a president “who is willing to, at best, test the boundaries of the executive powers of the president, and who seems perfectly willing to redefine those powers in ways that are unrecognizable to even judges whom he himself has appointed to the federal court.”\n\nA key test of the president’s use of the military\n\nMr. Trump’s administration has lost several high-profile lawsuits over his executive orders and other actions, while winning others. But the lawsuit over sending thousands of National Guard troops to Los Angeles, where protests have continued against detentions of migrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, could be a pivotal one. The legal order Mr. Trump signed June 7 – which also paved the way for deploying a battalion of active-duty Marines – isn’t limited to Los Angeles; critics say it provides cover for the militarization of a mass deportation program.\n\nWhat many Republicans see on the streets of Los Angeles and other Democratic-run cities is an effort to block the president’s legitimate enforcement of federal law. They accuse Democrats of undermining lawful operations against immigrants who have no legal right to be in this country. Mr. Walz, a Democrat who ran for vice president last year, drew criticism in recent days for calling ICE officers Mr. Trump’s “modern-day Gestapo.”\n\nOn the streets of Washington, observers gathered on Saturday to watch a parade celebrating the 250th anniversary of the founding of the U.S. Army, a date that coincided with Mr. Trump’s 79th birthday. The last time military vehicles and brass bands rolled through the capital was in 1991 to celebrate victory in the Gulf War; peacetime parades are much rarer.\n\nMany who turned out seemed unaware or uninterested in the political overtones of the parade, which critics assailed as a presidential vanity project that belonged in Beijing or Moscow. It’s “a once-in-a-lifetime kind of thing,” enthuses Andrew Mourog, a Maryland resident who is considering enlisting. “I’m just here to see some history, see some pretty cool vehicles.”\n\nJerry Henson’s son, an infantryman, was in the parade so Mr. Henson wasn’t going to miss it. “We’re all here to support him,” says the retired utility linesman and two-time Trump voter, sitting with his grandson and another relative. He says he supported the right to protest but was concerned about the violence in Los Angeles.\n\nThere were plenty of MAGA hats in the crowd, as well as families clad in red, white, and blue clothing. Flags adorned the viewing stand as more of them descended with a parachute team from overhead.\n\n“I feel like it can happen to anyone”\n\nFlags were also on display, some turned upside down, at No Kings marches across America. Organizers estimated more than 5 million people turned out in 2,100 cities and towns. While independent estimates were not available, news reports documented large crowds in major cities such as Philadelphia, Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles. The vast majority were peaceful, though police in Los Angeles used tear gas to disperse protesters who stayed after the event ended.\n\nEarlier in the week, California Gov. Gavin Newsom warned of a “perilous moment” for democracy after Mr. Trump’s unilateral order of troops to Los Angeles. “This is about all of us. This is about you. California may be first – but it clearly will not end here,” he said. He added, “Democracy is under assault before our eyes. This moment we have feared has arrived.”\n\nSome participants in Saturday’s demonstrations voiced similar trepidation.\n\nSarah Wideman, who joined the Women’s March in Washington in 2017 to oppose Mr. Trump’s first term, took part in an event held in Denver. She says this moment feels different. “It feels scarier to me,” she says, noting the lack of due process for immigrants under this administration. “If that can happen to immigrants, I feel like it can happen to anyone in America.”\n\nDonald Young came to Denver dressed as a Founding Father and carrying a copy of the Declaration of Independence. A Democrat, he says “we should be screaming from the rooftops” about Mr. Trump’s undermining of the rule of law. “The Founding Fathers are rolling in their graves,” reads a sign around his neck. “Congress has capitulated. SCOTUS is eviscerated,” he says, referring to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\nIn Thousand Oaks, California, hundreds of people gathered on an overpass crossing the 101 highway north of Los Angeles. Greg Yulish, a bread manufacturer, says some of his employees are afraid to turn up for work because of ICE raids. Detaining taxpaying workers who have no criminal record is unjust, he adds. He says he’s never protested before “but this really struck a chord.”\n\nHe cites Mr. Newsom’s warning about democracy and says people need to stand up to Mr. Trump or else “we’re just going to be an also-ran country with a puppet dictator.”\n\nCandace Kaplan, a retired American Airlines employee, says Mr. Trump is a threat to democracy because he ignores the law and “nobody’s been able to stop him. And we absolutely have to.” But she thinks people are becoming aware of these violations. “The only good thing that Donald Trump has done for me is he woke me up. He doesn’t like ‘woke,’ but he’s waking people up, whether he likes it or not, with his actions.”\n\nSounding the alarm or crying wolf?\n\nYet as Democrats issue ever more urgent warnings about Mr. Trump’s administration, their message about democracy-at-stake faces a challenge: Voters have heard it before. The first Trump administration featured a series of controversies and thunderous warnings of democratic erosion. He was twice impeached, the second time for inciting the rioters who stormed the U.S. Capitol in a failed attempt to reverse his 2020 election defeat. On his return to the White House, he pardoned some 1,600 people convicted for taking part in that Jan. 6, 2021 attack.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris repeatedly urged voters to reject Mr. Trump and his Republican Party because they were a threat to democracy. That message did little to prop up Ms. Harris, who ran on the Democratic ticket during an election dominated by immigration, inflation, and other issues on which Mr. Trump had an edge.\n\nAs a candidate, Mr. Trump explicitly said that he would use the National Guard as part of a mass deportation program and that he would also consider using active-duty military. “If I thought things were getting out of control, I would have no problem using the military, per se. We have to have safety in our country,” he told Time Magazine in April, 2024.\n\nMr. Trump’s supporters say that this describes what the administration has been doing in Los Angeles to protect public safety. Opponents see a more worrying step toward a politicized military that, over time, could become normalized and undermine civilian self-governance.\n\nThe 9th Circuit appeals court, which stayed the June 12 ruling against the Trump administration over the troops in LA, will hold a hearing Tuesday. Two judges of the three-member panel that paused the ruling are Trump appointees; the other was appointed by President Biden.\n\nShould the administration prevail, it would have legal authority to surge military units to other cities. Analysts say that putting troops on the streets who aren’t trained in law enforcement can be risky, given that ICE raids are likely to face obstruction by residents and protesters.\n\nThe war of words over military deployments in support of ICE has already made things “much tenser” between Democrats and Republicans, says Rachel VanLandingham, a former judge advocate in the U.S. Air Force. That a U.S. senator was bundled out of an administration event in front of cameras is another potentially worrying sign. “Everyone is on a hair trigger,” she says.\n\nSome of the latest messages from President Trump on immigration are mixed. On Thursday he signaled he would back off investigations affecting certain industries heavily reliant on immigrant labor, including agriculture and hotels.\n\nYet the White House’s demand that ICE meet a target of 3,000 arrests a day so that Mr. Trump delivers on his administration’s reported goal of 1 million deportations a year appears to be driving the intensity of ICE activities. Administration officials have said that non-cooperation from law enforcement in “sanctuary” cities in handing over migrants held in jails has forced ICE to track down migrants at their homes, workplaces, and, in some cases, immigration-related court hearings.\n\nThe White House memo issued June 7 authorized the deployment of troops, including active-duty soldiers, in other states and cities for 60 days or at the discretion of the secretary of defense. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth told a June 10 congressional hearing that more troops could be sent to cities “if there are riots … where law enforcement officers are threatened.”\n\nActive-duty forces aren’t allowed to make arrests but can briefly hold violent individuals before turning them over to law enforcement, Maj. Gen. Scott Sherman, the commander of the LA federal troops, told The Associated Press. He said the Guard troops and Marines are being trained on civil unrest and crowd control. “We are not law enforcement. This is not how we train,” Major General Sherman said, referring to their instructions.\n\n“I’m trying to defend our country”\n\nIn Pflugerville, Texas, a suburb of Austin, hundreds of protesters turned out Saturday. Many cheered as cars drove by honking their horns in support.\n\nWesley Webb, a Navy veteran, wasn’t sure about going, though he’s critical of Mr. Trump. What got him off his seat was the president’s comment that anyone who protested against the military parade in Washington “will be met with very heavy force.”\n\n“That is a direct First Amendment violation. That got my blood boiling,” says Mr. Webb.\n\nAcross the intersection, standing on the median between four lanes of traffic, Abhiram Garpati was standing alone in a MAGA hat carrying Trump-Vance signs. In a calm voice like Mr. Webb’s, he offers an alternative view. “I’m trying to defend our country,” he says. “What they’re trying to do is destroy our nation.”\n\nMr. Garpati received support from some cars driving past – a few drivers asked for Trump signs – but most honked at him. One driver called him a clown. Police kept a close eye on protesters who approached him.\n\nA few hours later, Mr. Garpati, who has run repeated unsuccessful campaigns for Congress, stood outside the Texas Capitol in Austin. Alone again, with his red Trump hat and Trump campaign signs, nobody seemed to bother him.\n\n“We are a democracy, and everybody at least has to listen and respect the other side,” he says.\n\nThis story was reported by Simon Montlake in Boston, Caitlin Babcock in Washington, Henry Gass in Austin, Texas, Sarah Matusek in Denver, and Ali Martin in Thousand Oaks, California.","summary":"While Washington hosted a military parade, large crowds gathered across the country Saturday to peacefully protest President Donald Trump’s policies.

In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday — expanding its recognition beyond Black America.\n This year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump’s second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognising other racial heritage celebrations.\n Still, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honour it.\n “I don’t think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. “I’ve not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.” People who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a “right” way to celebrate Juneteenth? For beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers: Is Juneteenth more of a solemn day of remembrance or a party? It depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans’ true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated.\n The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as “Black Codes,” enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n Last year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n Plans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office.\n Others may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n “The most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question What is Juneteenth?’” Morial said.\n What if you’ve never celebrated Juneteenth? Dr David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn’t learn about it until his 30s.\n “I think many folks haven’t known about it — who are even my colour as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn’t celebrate it,” Anderson said. “It was like just a part of history. It wasn’t a celebration of history.” For many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn’t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n What kind of public Juneteenth events are taking place? Search online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you’ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth’s history.\n The National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website.\n Are there special Juneteenth decorations or foods? The red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolises Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa.\n More people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth’s birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.\n Aside from barbecue, the colour red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolises the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n In recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialised with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.\n “I would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,” Morial said. “If you got to participate in that (commercialism), that’s what I would do.” Does how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren’t Black? Dr Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there’s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognise Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you’re not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n “I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,” Brown said. “It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience… Isn’t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.” What are other names used to refer to Juneteenth? Over the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n “Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we’re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,” Brown said. “Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.” Is there a proper Juneteenth greeting? It’s typical to wish people a “Happy Juneteenth” or “Happy Teenth,” according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organised a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.\n “You know how at Christmas people will say Merry Christmas’ to each other and not even know each other?” Freeman said. “You can get a Merry Christmas’ from everybody. This is the same way.” (AP) SCY SCY","summary":"","url":"https://www.news18.com/agency-feeds/a-guide-to-what-juneteenth-holiday-is-and-how-to-celebrate-it-9388120.html","image":"https://images.news18.com/ibnlive/uploads/2025/05/News18_India_Section_Default_Image_1600x900-2025-05-b4faf46d67a95708181b01e36cf20c4b.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 09:00:02","author":"News18","authors":["News18"],"language":"en","source_country":"in","sentiment":0.33},{"id":331864340,"title":"Trump fails to address Minnesota shootings in lengthy late-night rant about ‘illegal aliens’ and transgender people","text":"President Trump once again failed to address the shootings of two Minnesota lawmakers during a lengthy Truth Social post on Sunday night. \n\nTrump, who is set to arrive Monday in Canada’s Rocky Mountains for the annual G7 summit, instead expressed concerns on other matters, including immigration raids and transgender athletes in elite sports. \n\n“These Radical Left Democrats are sick of mind, hate our Country, and actually want to destroy our Inner Cities — And they are doing a good job of it! There is something wrong with them. \n\n“That is why they believe in Open Borders, Transgender for Everybody, and Men playing in Women’s Sports — And that is why I want ICE, Border Patrol, and our Great and Patriotic Law Enforcement Officers, to FOCUS on our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role” he wrote.\n\nTrump also said that “efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens” across American cities would be expanded despite violent protests occurring across the nation in the past week, and millions taking part in the “No Kings” protests on Saturday. \n\nHis message came around the same time that Minnesota Governor and Kamala Harris’ former running mate, Tim Walz, confirmed the arrest of shooting suspect Vance Luther Boelter, 57.\n\nBoelter’s arrest Sunday night came after the largest manhunt in Minnesota history following the fatal shootings of Melissa Hortman, the top Democrat in the Minnesota House, and her husband, Mark.\n\nWalz said the gunman, who was impersonating a police officer, had a list of possible targets.\n\nAuthorities say that Boelter allegedly shot another Democratic lawmaker and their spouse, state Senator John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home.\n\nTrump, however, has not posted a formal statement since his original message on Saturday.\n\n“I have been briefed on the terrible shooting that took place in Minnesota, which appears to be a targeted attack against State Lawmakers.

This is the same way.”","summary":"A guide to what the Juneteenth holiday is and how to celebrate it  AP News","url":"https://apnews.com/article/juneteenth-galveston-texas-1f8b201949c3197932d68036c0472686","image":"https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/a5dcd74/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3936x2214+0+209/resize/1440x810!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fda%2F82%2F6d455a2cda447f0d4be336f64593%2Fad9491d2664e4f01b5f2408f072df359","video":null,"publish_date":"2025-06-16 07:51:00","author":"Terry Tang","authors":["Terry Tang"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.331},{"id":331848454,"title":"Media, ad execs and celebs return to Cannes Lions","text":"It’s that time of year again when the mega-yachts of titans of media, tech and advertising drop anchor in the Mediterranean Sea, where the industry’s biggest names will convene in the glitzy French seaside town of Cannes to make deals and debate the industry’s biggest issues.\n\nThe rosé and champagne-infused week-long event, known as the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity, is roaring back this week for its 72nd year – and boasting over 12,000 attendees from over 97 countries, including a heavy-hitting list of top execs, celebs and athletes.\n\n“These are the biggest numbers they’ve ever had,” said 3CV founder Michael Kassan, who has not only been going to Cannes Lions for over 25 years, but is also instrumental in shaping it into what the event has become.\n\n“You have the agencies, you have the brands, you have the creatives, you have the media side and the platforms,” he said. That’s why you get the buzz and that’s why Cannes is a must-attend event. I’m not saying it’s immune to economic pressures and the like but the numbers for Cannes Lions are through the roof [this year].”\n\nThe self-proclaimed grand poobah of the illustrious event rattled off a slew of top names in media who will be at this week’s event, including Amazon CEO Andrew Jassy, newly named Instacart CEO Chris Rogers and Disney Entertainment co-chair Dana Walden, who is in the running for the top job when Mouse House CEO Bob Iger is slated to step down in late 2026.\n\nHeadlining speakers for the five-day fest, which starts Monday, include Adobe Systems CEO Shantanu Narayen, who will grab the Creative Champion of the Year award, as well as YouTube CEO Neal Mohan tennis star and entrepreneur Serena Williams, NFL player and Taylor Swift beau Travis Kelce, actress and Hello Sunshine founder Reese Witherspoon and “Tonight Show” host Jimmy Fallon.\n\nDespite the strong attendance, the economy will be top of mind for execs, who are grappling with how to deal with President Trump’s looming tariffs, a tepid mergers and acquisition environment and uncertainty about how the implementation of artificial intelligence will impact the advertising industry.\n\n“I might have a bit of a hot take on the economy,” said Yahoo Chief Revenue Officer Rob Wilk.”If you look at what you read, it seems way more gloomy than what I experience day to day.”\n\nWilk. whose media company is celebrating its 30th anniversary this year, said that the advertisers are “holding on to dry powder” and waiting to spend versus “slashing budgets and pulling back” and that he’s seeing that same caution reflected in dealmaking, due in part to the tariff conversation. \n\nHe said M&A deals will only happen if they’re an “accretive acquisition,” giving the example of Yahoo’s April acquisition of Artifact, the AI-driven news aggregation app from Instagram cofounders Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger.\n\n3CV’s Kasan said he expects the M&A environment to heat up later once two major deals close. He cited the $13.25 billion merger between ad giant Omnicom and Interpublic, which is expected to close later this year, and Skydance Media’s $8 billion acquisition of Paramount Global.\n\nCBS-parent Paramount is currently embroiled in talks to settle President Trump’s $20 billion lawsuit against “60 Minutes” over the editing of its sitdown with former Vice President Kamala Harris. The legal settlement will be key for the deal to move forward, according to media experts.\n\n“I do think the M&A landscape and entertainment will get a little busy once the Paramount deal is done,” Kassan said, noting that Cannes will be a hot bed for dealmaking and conversations about how to grow businesses.\n\nThis year, execs will be focused on four top issues that can drive revenue; artificial intelligence, commerce, creators and sports media, he said, adding that his new company 3CV will be hosting talks on these themes throughout the week at Plage 3CV on the Croisette.\n\n“AI is everything, everywhere all at once,” he said with a laugh. \n\nChristopher Vollmer, managing director of MediaLink and partner at UTA agreed, explaining that the “conversations around AI have shifted from can AI create something interesting to how do we create AI responsibly, distinctively and at scale?”\n\n“It’s more about a pragmatic application of AI versus a ‘gee whiz’ reaction,” he said, adding that chief financial officers of companies are pushing their marketing heads to spend efficiently and do more with less money.\n\n“The ability to do that – with the advancements in data, technology, etcetera— reinforces that it is possible to do more with less every year,” he said. “There’s a real focus on what price performance, what marketing investments of any kind can be tied to return on investment.”\n\nRetail or commerce media has become a huge focus for brands looking for growth. He pointed to Amazon– which will have a strong presence once again at Lions– as leading the charge in its value-proposition to partners. \n\n“Amazon’s whole proposition is ‘we know what you watch and we know what you buy,’” he said, adding that the e-commerce giant is driving a convergence across content, advertising, commerce and shopping.\n\n“It’s not just the big giants anymore,” said Lauren Wiener, Global lead of the marketing, sales and pricing practice of the Boston Consulting Group.”New players and category leaders are turning commerce data into media engines and redefining how advertisers reach consumers.”\n\nWiener added that chief marketing officers are “reshaping” how they spend, “not retreating,” and this is taking the form of “doubling down” on areas that unlock both efficiency and growth while slashing costs and legacy business models.\n\nBrand building is also central to any marketer’s agenda, and that the importance of sports media and creators/ influencers have exploded in recent years due in part to, its ability to reach younger audiences.\n\nProfessional athletes will take center stage at events held by Axios, Medialink, Deep Blue Sports and Stagwell with its impressive Sports Beach complex, addressing a variety of topics from the creator economy, AI, mental health, style and how to support female athletes.\n\nCannes will welcome NBA all-star Carmelo Anthony, WNBA champion Sue Bird, former NFL star Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson, former Yankee slugger Alex Rodriguez and soccer stars Alex Morgan and Megan Rapinoe, among others.\n\nBrands have leaned on athletes because they have become as important as traditional entertainment franchises due to their popularity and ability to drive engagement with consumers.\n\nPointing to the NBA finals, Josh Rosenberg, CEO of creative communications firm, Day One Agency said fans across the country are “really lit up.”\n\n“I think it is perfect for storytelling,” he said, referring to the finals. “Everyone is rooting for their person and I think that in this day and age, it is what is uniting large groups of people – and also this is one of the only times that audiences are tuned in at the same time to the same things.”\n\nRosenberg touted the rise in popularity of women’s sports and sports overall, as a way to also reach younger audiences.\n\n“There are all these new personalities that have their own social media followings and platforms and communities that fans are really engaged with, which are prime opportunities for a brand to capitalize on and for them to support athletes on their journey,” he said.\n\nAccording to Harry Kargman, CEO of mobile brand and ad agency Kargo, working with creators can help brands expand their reach but it’s imperative to have a diversified, measurable and targeted marketing strategy.\n\nWorking with influencers can be tricky because it’s almost impossible to measure the power of their reach, unlike with targeted ads, but he said it can be worth it for a brand if they’re looking to reach new customers.\n\n“I think influencers unlike other places- if they build the right content around a brand or around the brand message and if they have authenticity- it can be extraordinarily effective,” Kargman said, “It’s like close to word of mouth but it’s word of mouth to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of followers.”","summary":"It’s that time of year again when the mega-yachts of titans of media, tech and advertising drop anchor in the Mediterranean Sea, where the industry’s biggest names will convene in the glitzy French seaside town of Cannes to make deals and debate the industry’s biggest issues.

In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday — expanding its recognition beyond Black America. \n\nThis year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump’s second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.\n\nStill, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work. There are a plethora of street festivals, fairs, concerts and other events planned throughout the week leading into the holiday. But with the current political climate, some may wonder if their company will honor it.\n\n“I don’t think anyone should be intimidated or obligated into not celebrating the day,” said Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League. “I’ve not heard of anyone being denied. I think it would be absolutely reprehensible.”\n\nPeople who never gave the occasion more than a passing thought may be asking themselves, is there a “right” way to celebrate Juneteenth?\n\nFor beginners and those brushing up on history, here are some answers:\n\nIs Juneteenth more of a solemn day of remembrance or a party?\n\nIt depends on what you want. Juneteenth festivities are rooted in cookouts and picnics. Originally celebrated as Black Americans’ true Independence Day, outdoor events allowed for large, raucous reunions among formerly enslaved family, many of whom had been separated. The gatherings were especially revolutionary because they were free of restrictive measures, known as “Black Codes,” enforced in Confederate states. Codes controlled whether liberated slaves could vote, buy property, gather for worship and other aspects of daily life.\n\nLast year, the White House kicked things off early with a concert on the South Lawn for Juneteenth and Black Music Month. The atmosphere was primarily festive with Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Black vice president, dancing on stage with gospel singer Kirk Franklin.\n\nPlans for a Juneteenth event or proclamation this year have not been decided, according to the White House press office. \n\nOthers may choose to treat Juneteenth as a day of rest and remembrance. That can mean doing community service, attending an education panel or taking time off.\n\n“The most important thing everyone should do is be able to quickly answer the question ‘What is Juneteenth?’” Morial said. \n\nWhat if you’ve never celebrated Juneteenth?\n\n Dr. David Anderson, a Black pastor and CEO of Gracism Global, a consulting firm helping leaders navigate conversations bridging divides across race and culture, never did anything on Juneteenth in his youth. He didn’t learn about it until his 30s.\n\n“I think many folks haven’t known about it — who are even my color as an African American male. Even if you heard about it and knew about it, you didn’t celebrate it,” Anderson said. “It was like just a part of history. It wasn’t a celebration of history.”\n\nFor many African Americans, the farther away from Texas that they grew up increased the likelihood they didn’t have big Juneteenth celebrations regularly. In the South, the day can vary based on when word of Emancipation reached each state.\n\nWhat kind of public Juneteenth events are taking place?\n\nSearch online and you will find gatherings nationwide varying in scope and tone. Some are more carnival-esque festivals with food trucks, arts and crafts and parades. Within those festivals, you’ll likely find information on health care, finance and community resources. There also are concerts and fashion shows to highlight Black creativity. There will also be panels to educate about Juneteenth’s history.\n\nThe National Park Service is again making entry into all sites free on the holiday, according to its website. \n\nAre there special Juneteenth decorations or foods?\n\nThe red, black and green African Liberation Flag, also known as the Pan-African flag, has historically been displayed at both Black History Month and Juneteenth celebrations. Red represents bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. Black symbolizes Black people. Green represents richness of the land in Africa. \n\nMore people, however, have leaned into the Juneteenth flag created in 1997 by activist Ben Haith, who founded the National Juneteenth Celebration Foundation. Like the American flag, it is red, white and blue to indicate those freed are also Americans. The five-point white star in the middle is a tribute to Juneteenth’s birthplace of Texas. It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nIn recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.\n\n“I would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,” Morial said. “If you got to participate in that (commercialism), that’s what I would do.”\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren’t Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there’s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you’re not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n“I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,” Brown said. “It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. … Isn’t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.”\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n“Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we’re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,” Brown said. “Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.”\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt’s typical to wish people a “Happy Juneteenth” or “Happy Teenth,” according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.\n\n“You know how at Christmas people will say ‘Merry Christmas’ to each other and not even know each other?” Freeman said. “You can get a ‘Merry Christmas’ from everybody.

On the one hand, Trump’s low-energy Dear Leader parade (that cost you $45 million). On the other, millions of people across the country gathering peacefully to say: Here, we have no kings,' she captioned photos from the DC parade and a Los Angeles protest.\n\nWhile the post received agreements from the ex-secretary of state's fellow liberals, she was walloped again by much of social media, especially when she once again turned off the ability to reply to her tweet. \n\n'Hillary Clinton hates the troops, bigtime,' wrote Eric Daughtery. \n\nTravis Parsley went a step further: 'Hillary Clinton hates everything about America!'\n\nOne commenter asked: 'Do you think Hillary hates our military?'\n\nSeveral responded by bringing up one of the most famous scandals she faced as head of the State Department for Barack Obama. \n\n'Yes !! Remember Benghazi,' answered one. \n\nRepublicans claimed in 2016 that the Obama White House and Clinton lied repeatedly to the American people about the nature of and reasons for the 2012 terror attacks in Benghazi, Libya, even as they privately acknowledged what caused them. \n\nThe GOP members of the House Benghazi committee issued their 800 page report with excoriating words for her and the president, accusing her of 'shameful' conduct over her secret email account, and the White House of lying about what caused the attacks.\n\nHer 'homebrew' server was only revealed because of the investigation into the deaths of four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens.\n\nAnother social media user pointed out that Clinton holds a deep hatred of anyone sympathetic to the president. \n\n'She hates our country. We are deplorables.'\n\nDuring a fundraiser on her failed 2016 campaign, she had called half of Trump's supporters racist, homophobic, sexist, xenophobic, or Islamophobic and said they belonged in a 'basket of deplorables'. \n\nClinton later backtracked on her comments saying she regrets half of her remarks, after admitting she was 'grossly generalistic' in what she said at the LGBT event in New York, adding 'that's never a good idea'.\n\nStill others said that Clinton simply couldn't take the heat and locked up the replies to her post. \n\nOne wrote: 'Turn on your replies or put down the phone!' \n\nSome of Clinton's supporters still had her back in response to the post trashing Trump.\n\nJennifer Vallez wrote: 'And no one needed to pay us to protest. We hate him for free! #powertothepeople'\n\n'I love you so much for doing this, Hillary!!! The shade of it all!' added another. \n\nSeveral even wrote in doubt of the legitimacy of Trump's election victory, with one suggesting they 'prove it' that Kamala Harris won in November.\n\nUltimately, President Trump got the birthday present he had been hoping for - good weather. \n\nDespite several drops of rain falling as he and first lady Melania Trump arrived at Saturday's 250th anniversary for the U.S. Army, Washington, D.C.'s skies stayed clear enough for flyovers, parachute jumps and a grand fireworks display. \n\nThe president spoke for an uncharacteristically short eight minutes, but in doing so delivered a stern warning to America's enemies. \n\n'There is no earthly force more powerful than the brave heart of the U.S. military or an Army Ranger paratrooper or Green Beret,' he told the crowd, sprawled far out onto the National Mall surrounding the Washington Monument. \n\nThere were fears ahead of Saturday's event, which coincided with Trump's 79th birthday, that the evening parade would have to be postponed or scrapped if there was lightning in the area. \n\nThe only lightning and thunder at the event was during country crooner Warren Zeiders' performance and when AC/DC's Thunderstruck played. \n\nAhead of the event there were also worries about protests. \n\nWhile some of the 'No Kings' demonstrations around the country turned chaotic - including an incident with a man driving into a crowd - on the Mall there were only a smattering of critics - some quietly holding signs, others more loudly heckling the president's MAGA fans. \n\nThe president and first lady arrived at a viewing box where the Ellipse meets Constitution Avenue, with Melania sporting a cream pinstripe suit for the occasion.\n\nAfter the Star-Spangled banner, when there was a break in the programming, members of the crowd loudly broke out into 'Happy Birthday' for Trump. \n\nTrump's family members were also on hand - Donald Trump Jr., with girlfriend Bettina Anderson, Eric Trump with wife Lara, as well as Tiffany Trump - who gave birth last month to her first child.\n\nDana White, the Trump pal and Ultimate Fighting Championship CEO, scored a prime seat to the parade. \n\nSusie Wiles, the White House Chief of Staff, sat in the second row wearing a large pair of reflective sunglasses. \n\nThe parade showcased the history of the Army, with the earliest period uniforms going first. \n\nWhile the president is used to packed crowds for his rallies, the attendance for Saturday’s parade wasn’t overwhelming.\n\nAttendees had plenty of space on the National Mall to spread out. \n\nThe VIP bleachers located across from the press section were barely full.\n\nLines did stretch dozens of people deep for the food trucks that had been allowed on the National Mall.\n\nThere were handfuls of protesters, but most sat quietly while holding their signs. \n\nThe evening ended with a grand fireworks display over the National Mall, which was timed to a number of patriotic songs.","summary":"Trump's former presidential rival couldn't help but try to compare the parade - which sparked fiery debates over attendance - to the 'No Kings Day' rallies held in left-leaning cities.","url":"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-14815191/Hillary-Clinton-troll-Donald-Trump-parade-backfires.html","image":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2025/06/16/02/99406231-0-image-m-68_1750038554061.jpg","video":"https://videos.dailymail.co.uk/video/mol/2025/06/15/3916779436863537692/1024x576_MP4_3916779436863537692.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-16 01:51:56","author":"Editor,Stephen M.

All his relationships are transactions, including with his three wives and his children. When people are no longer useful to him—wives, lawyers, advisors, Cabinet members—he discards them.\n\nHis current wife Melania is transactional, too. She married him for his money. She obviously doesn't love or respect him and she occasionally displays her disdain for him in public. She didn’t even campaign for him last year, except to make a few public appearances. \n\nTrump hardly ever laughs. He has an almost-constant angry scowl on his face. To Trump, the world is a dark and foreboding place, where, like him, people are consumed by greed and lust. He relies on money and intimidation to get what he wants because he has no capacity for empathy or love—or any belief that people can be motivated by idealism and compassion.\n\nTrump grew up in a world of vast privilege, but that doesn't mean that he wasn't emotionally wounded.\n\nBoth the federal raids on immigrants in Los Angeles and the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C. reflect Trump’s need to look tough, manly, and in control.\n\nAccording to his niece Mary Trump, a clinical psychologist, he was bullied by his father, who must have told Donald that he wasn't smart and that he was (or should be worried about being) a loser. In 2017, 27 psychiatrists and mental health experts published a book, The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, warning that he was erratic and unstable as pressures mounted on him. Two years later, they updated the book—this time with 37 experts weighing in on Trump’s troubled mental health.\n\nHe has no strong beliefs about governing or public policy. His major motivations are money, power, revenge, racism, and adulation.\n\nOne of Trump’s few joys in life are the cheers from his fans at MAGA rallies. So, to compensate for his insecurities, feed his ego, and to mobilize his MAGA followers, he has planned this massive parade on June 14—today—ostensibly to celebrate the U.S. Army’s 250th birthday, but which also just happens to coincide with this 79th birthday. The plan is to include 6,600 soldiers, 150 vehicles, 50 helicopters, and seven military bands, and 34 horses—at a cost of about $50 million—money that could otherwise be spent on improving the lives of soldiers and military veterans. The event will require the closure of Ronald Reagan National Airport to accommodate flyovers and fireworks displays. Trump intends it as a display of force, domination, and personal power. It is more about him than about honoring our soldiers and veterans. \n\nIn U.S. history, large military parades have typically come at the end of wars as part of demobilizing troops and celebrating getting the country back to normal. But such spectacles have a long tradition in authoritarian countries, where dictators, including the current rulers of Russian and North Korea, seek to bind themselves to national identity. The most disreputable of these displays of dominance were the mass rallies and parades organized by the Nazis to celebrate Adolf Hitler, depicted in Leni Riefenstahl’s pathbreaking propaganda film “Triumph of the Will,” that celebrated Hitler speaking at a massive Nazi Party rally in Nurenberg in 1934. \n\nHaving won a second term, Trump is now wants to consolidate his grip on power. He’s sought to bend those whom he views as his critics and opponents—universities, media companies, law firms, judges, businesses, scientists, artists and performers, and even professional sports teams—to his will. Both the federal raids on immigrants in Los Angeles and the upcoming military parade in Washington, D.C. reflect Trump’s need to look tough, manly, and in control.\n\nFrom his father, who was arrested at a Klan rally in 1927, he also absorbed the racist ideas of the fake science of eugenics, which was popular in America in the early 1900s.\n\nIn 1988, he told Oprah Winfrey that a person had “to have the right genes” in order to achieve great fortune. In 2010, he told CNN that he was a “gene believer,” explaining that “when you connect two racehorses, you usually end up with a fast horse.” He compared his own “gene pool” to that of successful thoroughbreds. During a 2020 campaign speech to a crowd of white supporters in Minnesota, Trump said, “You have good genes, you know that, right? You have good genes. A lot of it is about the genes, isn’t it, don’t you believe? You have good genes in Minnesota.”\n\nBut in fact, Trump has thus always been insecure about his family's genes. His father lied about his family's heritage, pretending that the Trumps were from Swedish, not German, ancestry. Trump repeated the lie in his book, The Art of the Deal. (He later said that he wouldn't mind if the US had more immigrants from Scandinavia, but kept out immigrants from \"shithole countries,\" an outrageously racist comment). Trump said at a rally in Iowa that immigrants are \"poisoning the blood of the country. They're destroying the fabric of our country, and we're going to have to get them out.\"\n\nTrump believes that most white Americans share his racism toward immigrants and that he can weaponize that hatred by carrying out a mass deportation of people he calls “illegal” and “criminals.” He’s sent federal agents to Los Angeles to arrest immigrant workers and parents, followed by National Guard troops to intimidate and arrest those who are protesting the anti-immigrant raids. This is all designed to create fear and chaos to give Trump cover as the “law and order” president and, as Rep. Laura Friedman (D-CA) noted, “an excuse to declare martial law in California.” The timing is no accident. The federal raids—which Trump is likely to expand to other cities—are meant to divert public attention from Trump’s legislative plan to cut Medicaid and other essential programs in order to give a huge tax cut to the super-rich. \n\nTrump often claims that he's a self-made billionaire. In fact, he inherited his father's wealth, as reporters Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig explain in their 2024 book, Lucky Loser: How Donald Trump Squandered His Father’s Fortune and Created the Illusion of Success. His father bankrolled his developments and bailed him out when they failed. Despite his boasts, he knows that most of his business ventures—his casinos, hotels, golf courses, fake university, airline, football team, clothing line, steaks, and others—failed. Most banks won't go near Trump, because they consider him a toxic grifter who consistently defrauds his subcontractors, employees, and lenders. According to Forbes magazine—which ranks the world’s billionaires—Trump was never as wealthy as he claimed to be.\n\nThe timing is no accident. The federal raids—which Trump is likely to expand to other cities—are meant to divert public attention from Trump’s legislative plan to cut Medicaid and other essential programs in order to give a huge tax cut to the super-rich.\n\nTrump's favorite insults, directed toward people he considers his enemies, are \"not smart\" and \"losers.\" Clearly the man is projecting.\n\nTrump was terrified of losing last year’s election because he might have had to go to prison and also because he'd be viewed as a \"loser,\" which in his mind is the worst thing you can be, a consequence of his father's disparagement and his mother's neglect. He was doubly worried that he might lose to a Black woman, Kamala Harris, whom he described as “not smart.” \n\nTrump is clearly insecure about his mental abilities and worries that it's due to his inferior genes. He’s boasted that he comes from a superior genetic stock and that he is a \"very stable genius.\" For years, he has constantly insisted that \"I'm smart.\" “Throughout my life,” Trump tweeted in 2018, “my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.” He lied about being first in his class in college. He didn't even make the Dean's List. Whenever he has defended his intelligence, it isn't clear if he's trying to convince his interviewers or himself. \n\nHe’s even defensive about his vocabulary. He claims to have \"great words,\" although linguists who have studied his speeches and other statements say he has the vocabulary of an adolescent. He doesn't read—for pleasure or work. As president, he doesn’t read the memos prepared for him by his staff, including intelligence briefs. Some observers attributed this to his arrogance. But more likely it is because he can’t understand what is in them. He'd rather be considered arrogant than stupid. \n\nAt least 26 of his top aides publicly said that Trump was unfit to be president. They questioned his competence, character, impulsiveness, narcissism, judgement, intelligence, and even his sanity. \n\nAccording to Michael Wolff, in his book, Fire and Fury, both former chief of staff Reince Priebus and ex-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called Trump an “idiot.” Trump’s one-time economic adviser Gary Cohn said Trump was “dumb as shit.” His national security adviser H.R. McMaster described the president as a “dope.” In July 2017, news stories reported that Rex Tillerson, Trump’s first Secretary of State, called the president a “moron.” When asked, he did not deny using that term. In an interview with Foreign Affairs magazine, Tillerson recounted that Trump’s “understanding of global events, his understanding of global history, his understanding of U.S. history was really limited.” He said, “It’s really hard to have a conversation with someone who doesn’t even understand the concept for why we’re talking about this.”\n\n“Anyone who puts himself over the Constitution should never be president of the United States,” said his former Vice President, Mike Pence. Mark Esper, one of Trump’s Defense Secretaries, said that Trump is not “fit for office because he puts himself first, and I think anybody running for office should put the country first.” In his farewell speech, Mark Milley, a retired Army general who served as chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from October 1, 2019, to September 30, 2023, warned “We don’t take an oath to a wannabe dictator,” clearly referring to Trump. John Kelly, a retired Marine Corps four-star general who served as chief of staff from 2017 to 2019, said that Trump “admires autocrats and murderous dictators” and “has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law.” \n\nSoon after the January 6, 2021 insurrection, McMaster, the former national security advisor, told CNN’s Jake Tapper that Trump had incited the riot through “sustained disinformation… spreading these unfounded conspiracy theories.” He accused Trump of “undermining rule of law.” Sarah Matthews, deputy White House press secretary during Trump’s first term, witnessed Trump staffers trying, without success, to get the president to condemn the January 6 violence. “In my eyes, it was a complete dereliction of duty that he did not uphold his oath of office,” she toldUSA Today. “I lost all faith in him that day” and resigned from her job. Trump’s “continuation of pushing this lie that the election is stolen has made him wholly unfit to hold office every again,” Matthews said.\n\nWhat kind of president invites the media to attend Cabinet meetings where each member is required to humiliate themselves by telling Trump how wonderful he is?\n\nBut let's give Trump some credit. He does have the kind of intelligence, sometimes called \"street smarts,\" attributed to hustlers, con men, and grifters. That seems to have worked for him.\n\nTrump knows that many Republicans in Congress laugh at him behind his back but don't say anything in public because they fear him—particularly his ability to find candidates to run against them in the GOP primaries. \n\nHe also knows that most world leaders don't respect him. We’ve now been witness to the ritualized Oval Office meetings between Trump and his counterparts, where Trump seeks to bully, coerce, and humiliate them. A few have challenged him, which gets him angry enough to seek revenge. His meetings with Putin are somewhat different, since he envies the Russian autocrat’s power. Trump’s bromance and recent break-up with Elon Musk is partly about policy but mostly a battle of egos and wills.\n\nWhat kind of person craves being famous for telling people, \"You're fired\"? But that's how he became a TV celebrity. What kind of president invites the media to attend Cabinet meetings where each member is required to humiliate themselves by telling Trump how wonderful he is? To Trump, respect is a zero-sum game. He likes to demean others to boost himself.\n\nTrump will try, and fail, to cancel the 2028 elections and remain in power. But don't expect him to fade away. He will seek to become the leader of a white nationalist supremacist movement while continuing to dominate the Republican Party. The MAGA forces he’s unleashed since 2016 will also still be around. It is no accident that racist, anti-immigrant, and anti-Semitic incidents have spiked since Trump began campaigning for president. Trump verbalizes, encourages, enables, tolerates, winks at, and makes excuses for hate groups, most notably when he said that some of the Nazis marching in Charlottesville in 2017 were “good people.”\n\nWhenTrump dies from the side effects of obesity, the nation and the world will breathe a huge sigh of relief.\n\nBut as he gets crazier and crazier, and no longer has the power of the presidency, most of his followers will abandon him, crowds at his rallies will be smaller and smaller, and he’ll become a lonely, decrepit old man, a fallen idol like the Orson Welles character (Charles Kane) in the 1941 film \"Citizen Kane\" and the Andy Griffith character (Lonesome Rhodes) in the 1957 film \"A Face in the Crowd.\" \n\nHe'll retreat to Mar-a-Lago—his Xanadu—by himself and with his paid staff. Or perhaps he'll spend much of his remaining years in federal prison, seething over how he was the victim of conspiracies.\n\nWhen Trump dies from the side effects of obesity, the nation and the world will breathe a huge sigh of relief. And while he can't quite admit it to himself, he knows it, and it terrifies him.\n\nNOW READ: Here's how Trump could be stopped in his tracks","summary":"I must admit, if Trump wasn't such a power-hungry demagogue, a danger to democracy, a sexual predator, racist, sociopath, pathological liar, bully, and impulsive and unstable megalomaniac, I might feel sorry for him.\n\nHe has no real friends, just sycophants. All his relationships are transactions, including with his three wives and his children. When people are no longer useful to him—wives, lawyers, advisors, Cabinet members—he discards them.\n\nHis current wife Melania is transactional, too. She married him for his money. She obviously doesn't love or respect him and she occasionally displays her disdain for him in public. She didn’t even campaign for him last year, except to make a few public appearances. \n\nTrump hardly ever laughs. He has an almost-constant angry scowl on his face. To Trump, the world is a dark and foreboding place, where, like him, people are consumed by greed and lust.

It is encircled by another white starry line that represents the spreading of freedom.\n\nAside from barbecue, the color red has been a through line for Juneteenth food for generations. Red symbolizes the bloodshed and sacrifice of enslaved ancestors. A Juneteenth menu might incorporate items like barbecued ribs or other red meat, watermelon and red velvet cake. Drinks like fruit punch and red Kool-Aid may make an appearance at the table.\n\nIn recent years, Juneteenth has become more commercialized with national chains selling Juneteenth party supplies, T-shirts and other merchandise. However, this year, Juneteenth items appear to be fewer or only online. Morial says he would be disappointed if companies decided selling Juneteenth items out in the open was too risky because of politics. At the same time, it might be a good opportunity for consumers.\n\n“I would also encourage people to go online and look for an African American vendor,” Morial said. “If you got to participate in that (commercialism), that's what I would do.”\n\nDoes how you celebrate Juneteenth matter if you aren’t Black?\n\nDr. Karida Brown, a sociology professor at Emory University whose research focuses on race, said there’s no reason to feel awkward about wanting to recognize Juneteenth just because you have no personal ties or you’re not Black. In fact, embrace it.\n\n“I would reframe that and challenge my non-Black folks who want to lean into Juneteenth and celebrate,” Brown said. “It absolutely is your history. It absolutely is a part of your experience. ... Isn’t this all of our history? The good, the bad, the ugly, the story of emancipation and freedom for your Black brothers and sisters under the Constitution of the law.”\n\nWhat are other names used to refer to Juneteenth?\n\nOver the decades, Juneteenth has also been called Freedom Day, Emancipation Day, Black Fourth of July and second Independence Day among others.\n\n“Because 1776, Fourth of July, where we’re celebrating freedom and liberty and all of that, that did not include my descendants,” Brown said. “Black people in America were still enslaved. So that that holiday always comes with a bittersweet tinge to it.”\n\nIs there a proper Juneteenth greeting?\n\nIt’s typical to wish people a “Happy Juneteenth” or “Happy Teenth,” according to Alan Freeman, a comedian who has organized a June 19 comedy show at Club 68, which local media has described as the last Black bar and club on Galveston Island. The day after he will host a stand-up comedy and jazz show at his Houston restaurant and lounge, the Frisky Whisky.\n\n“You know how at Christmas people will say ‘Merry Christmas’ to each other and not even know each other?” Freeman said. “You can get a ‘Merry Christmas’ from everybody. This is the same way.”","summary":"It was 160 years ago that enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, learned they had been freed — after the Civil War&#8217;s end and two years after President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe resulting Juneteenth holiday — it&#8217;s name combining “June” and “nineteenth” — has only grown in one-and-a-half centuries. In 2021, President Joe Biden designated it a federal holiday — expanding its recognition beyond Black America.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year will be the first Juneteenth under President Donald Trump&#8217;s second administration, which has banned diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, or DEI, in the federal government. This has included removing Black American history content from federal websites. Trump officials have also discouraged some federal agencies from recognizing other racial heritage celebrations.\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, many people anticipate getting Juneteenth off work.

He was the subject of several sexting scandals before she separated from him in 2016.\n\nUnlike the ongoing conflict in the Middle East, the Soros-Abedin weekend did feature a gesture of unity between two religions that have historically been the source of wars and cultural conflict with a smaller ceremony on Friday to honor both Ms. Abedin’s Muslim faith and Mr. Soros’s Jewish heritage.

Alleged Minnesota assassin was appointed by Tim Walz, ‘voted for Trump’","text":"MINNEAPOLIS — The massive manhunt for alleged Minnesota political assassin Vance Luther Boelter — and revelations about his bizarre life and back story — have sparked major questions about his political affiliations and motives.\n\nCops believe that Vance Luther Boelter murdered a top Democratic state lawmaker and attempted to kill another Dem politician. But, he was also appointed to a state advisory board by Democratic Gov. Tim Walz. \n\nBoelter claimed to have a doctorate of education, and said he spent extensive time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa — where he was seen in videos apparently preaching on stage.\n\nBoelter, 57, is being hunted by authorities in connection with the assassination of Democrat Rep. Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark in their suburban Minneapolis home early on Saturday, in what Walz described as “targeted political violence.”\n\nThe suspected assassin, who reportedly had a list of 70 “targets” including that of Walz, is also accused of badly wounding a second Democrat lawmaker, Senator John Hoffman, and his wife, Yvette, at their home in Champlin, a northern suburb of Minneapolis, on Saturday.\n\nBoelter was reportedly impersonating law enforcement when he entered both lawmakers’ homes and when he later exchanged gunfire with police.\n\nHaunting security camera footage believed to show him wearing a creepy latex mask of an old man’s face was shared by the FBI on Saturday, which issued a $50,000 reward for information leading to his capture.\n\n‘Politically motivated assassination’\n\nGov. Walz described the killing of Hortman as “a politically motivated assassination.”\n\nHis roommate said that he had conservative political views, but rarely talked about politics and didn’t seem overtly political.\n\n“He was a Trump supporter. He voted for Trump. He liked Trump. I like Trump,” lifelong friend David Carlson told The Post. \n\n“He didn’t like abortion.”\n\nBoelter lived with Carlson and another man part-time while he worked a job in Minneapolis — while his wife and children lived on a farm in rural Green Isle, about 50 minutes from the big city. \n\nFollowing the shootings, he sent a sinister message to his friends.\n\n“I’m going to be gone for a while. May be dead shortly, so I just want to let you know I love you guys both and I wish it hadn’t gone this way,” he said in the message, as reported by the Minnesota Star Tribune.\n\nWhen cops searched Boelter’s car, they found a targeted list of individuals including several politicians as well as abortion providers and pro-abortion politicians, the Star Tribune reported.\n\nThose included Democratic Rep. Kelly Morrison and US Sen. Tina Smith, according to their respective offices.\n\nA picture of handwritten fliers with the slogan “No Kings,” which has become a popular anti-Trump rallying cry, were also reportedly found in his car, according to law enforcement.\n\nAppointed by Gov. Tim Walz\n\nTwo notices of appointment for Boelter to the Governor’s Workforce Development Board (GWDB) were obtained by KTTC.\n\nAlthough the exact motivations for Boelter’s alleged crimes are unclear, it is known that he served on the same state workforce development board as Sen. Hoffman, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said.\n\nThe first notice was issued by Gov. Walz’s predecessor, Mark Dayton, a fellow Democrat, in June 2016 for a two-year term.\n\nBoelter was listed as a private sector representative for Dayton’s appointment.\n\nHe was reappointed to the board by Gov. Walz in December 2019, this time as a business member, for a term that expired in January 2023.\n\nThe GWDB is listed under Minnesota’s Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED), which includes Sen. Hoffman under its current membership directory.\n\nWaltz sources told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune that the governor, who was Kamala Harris’ presidential running-mate, didn’t know Boelter. \n\nBoelter was merely re-appointed to a bipartisan advisory board that had 60 members, his office told the newspaper.\n\nBoelter mysterious work history\n\nBoelter spent much of his career in the food industry, working at Nestle and Del Monte, as well as a spell at Wisconsin-based Johnsonville Sausage, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nHe is a St. Cloud State University graduate and later received his Master of Science and a doctor of education from Cardinal Stritch University, a private Catholic establishment in Milwaukee, which closed in May 2023 following financial challenges and declining enrollment.\n\nHe spent a decade as a general manager at a Greencore grocery store and at a 7-Eleven in Minneapolis before leaving in November 2021 to become CEO of a mysterious company called Red Lion Group.\n\nIt is not clear what the company did and the website for Red Lion Group, linked to Boelter’s LinkedIn profile, is currently down.\n\nBoelter also claimed he was the head of a security company in Minnesota, but also reportedly had links to central Africa.\n\nA month ago, Boelter claimed he was looking for work and wanted to get back into the food industry on his LinkedIn, while also describing his recent work in Africa with the mystery Red Lion Group.\n\n“I’m looking to get back into the US Food Industry and I’m pretty open to positions,” he wrote. “I have been doing projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo in central Africa the last three years with Red Lion Group. If you hear of any opportunities or just want to catch up, please send me a message.”\n\nHe described himself as open to senior roles in Texas, Minnesota, Florida and the Washington DC-Baltimore area.\n\nTwo years ago, he claimed he was “currently in the Democratic Republic of Congo working on several projects, adding that “Red Lion Group had a great meeting with the new Governor of Congo Central to talk about our private business projects that are all moving forward.”\n\nBoelter is also listed as the director of security patrols on the website of the Praetorian Guard Security Services, which uses a photo of him also shared by the FBI.\n\nPraetorian Guard Security Services claimed to provide residential armed home security in Minnesota. However, his roommate Carlson said the company never had any clients or employees. \n\n“His dream was to have a security company. He never was or never had a security company. It’s like me saying I want to start a company selling hot dogs, but I need a hot dog stand,” he said. \n\n“I find a hot dog stand and I need supplies and it never kinda works out and I have the hot dog stand.”\n\nDespite that, he made big claims about his work.\n\n“Vance has been involved with security situations in Eastern Europe, Africa, North America and the Middle East, including the West Bank, Southern Lebanon and the Gaza Strip,” his profile on the company website reads.\n\n“He brings a great security aspect forged by both many on the ground experiences combined with training by both private security firms and by people in the U.S. Military. He has worked for the largest U.S. oil refining company, the world’s largest food company based in Switzerland and the world’s largest convenience retailer based in Japan.”\n\nSearch continues\n\nPolice on Sunday are still surrounding Boelter’s home around five miles from the remote hamlet of Green Isle, which itself is an hour outside of Minneapolis.\n\nHis only public criminal history in Minnesota is for minor traffic tickets including speeding and parking violations, KTTC reports.\n\nThe manhunt for Boelter is continuing into Sunday with parts of suburban Minneapolis put under shelter-place-orders.\n\nResidents in South Dakota were warned to watch out for a maroon Buick potentially being driven by a “person of interest in the events that have happened in Minnesota,” who could be traveling with someone “armed and dangerous,” according to law enforcement.","summary":"Boelter claimed to have a doctorate of education, and said he spent extensive time in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in Africa — where he was seen in videos apparently preaching on stage.","url":"https://nypost.com/2025/06/15/us-news/what-are-vance-luther-boelter-politics-alleged-minnesota-assassin-was-appointed-by-tim-walz-voted-for-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/vance-boelter-comp-106542401.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/USu8s2Iw-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2025-06-15 21:17:48","author":"Anthony Blair,Steven Vago","authors":["Anthony Blair","Steven Vago"],"language":"en","category":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.138},{"id":331728190,"title":"Trump vetos Israeli plan to kill Iran’s supreme leader","text":"ISRAEL AND IRAN CONTINUE ATTACKS\n\nIsrael and Iran continued to launch attacks against each other on Sunday despite international calls to de-escalate their conflict, as reports claim US President Donald Trump vetoed an Israeli plan to kill Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.\n\nThe New York Times says Israel bombarded the Iranian capital Tehran with a new wave of strikes on Sunday afternoon before Iran launched missiles and drones at Israel in response, with reports that explosions were heard over Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, while the port city of Haifa was struck on Sunday evening. The BBC reports Israel has confirmed it is continuing to fire at targets within Iran throughout the night.\n\nThe NYT said Israel’s earlier daytime attack on Tehran came as both sides were still assessing the damage from assaults on Saturday evening. “Overnight, Israeli fighter jets bombarded Tehran, setting the sky ablaze with flames from burning fuel reservoirs from the country’s vital energy industry, while Iran launched volleys of ballistic missiles at Israel, some of which eluded the country’s air defences,” the NYT reports.\n\nThe BBC quotes Iranian media reports as saying 128 people have been killed in the country as of Saturday midday, while 10 people are reported to have been killed in Iran’s attacks on Saturday night. Iran’s health ministry says Israeli strikes have killed 224 people across the country since Friday.\n\nIn the last couple of hours, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has given a live interview on Fox News, saying: “The issue here is not de-escalation. The issue here is not ceasefire. The issue is to stop those things that threaten our survival.”\n\nIsrael has claimed it launched “Operation Rising Lion”, which initially targeted Iran’s military command and nuclear sites, on Friday “to roll back the Iranian threat to Israel’s very survival”. The Israeli PM said Iran has taken steps to “weaponise” in recent months and that, “if not stopped, Iran could produce a nuclear weapon in a very short time”, the BBC reports. The broadcaster adds Iran has denied that it has a nuclear weapons program.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News on Sunday, Netanyahu said he and Trump are “fully coordinated” as the latter took to his social media platform to try and claim there would be “peace soon” between Israel and Iran and called on both sides to “make a deal”. Writing on Truth Social, the 79-year-old claimed: “Many calls and meetings now taking place. I do a lot, and never get credit for anything, but that’s OK, the PEOPLE understand. MAKE THE MIDDLE EAST GREAT AGAIN!”\n\nIn the last couple of hours, Reuters has reported that Trump vetoed an alleged Israeli plan to kill Khamenei.\n\nA senior US administration official is quoted as saying: “Have the Iranians killed an American yet? No. Until they do, we’re not even talking about going after the political leadership.” The Associated Press has also run the story and sourced the claims to a US official familiar with the matter.\n\nThe newswire states Israel “had informed the Trump administration in recent days that they had developed a credible plan to kill Khamenei. After being briefed on the plan, the White House made clear to Israeli officials that Trump was opposed to the Israelis making the move”.\n\nAP reports the Trump administration “is desperate to keep Israel’s military operation aimed at decapitating Iran’s nuclear program from exploding into an even more expansive conflict”.\n\nOn Sunday, the US president told America’s ABC News: “We’re not involved in it [Israel’s strikes on Iran]. It’s possible we could get involved. But we are not at this moment involved.”\n\nThe New York Times adds that the head of the Iranian traffic police, residents and Iranian news media report the roads leading out of Tehran have been packed with heavy traffic “as people scramble to find a way to leave the capital”. The Guardian reports Netanyahu earlier on Sunday said Iran will pay a “heavy price” after Israeli civilians were killed in the overnight strikes.\n\nElsewhere, the newspaper also reports European leaders plan to spend the opening day of the G7 summit in Canada asking Trump to justify his aforementioned confidence in a peace deal between Israel and Iran.\n\nALBANESE IN CANADA FOR TRUMP TALKS\n\nSpeaking of the G7 summit, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese will land in Canada on Sunday (local time) ahead of his much-discussed talks with US President Donald Trump on the sidelines of the gathering of world leaders.\n\nThe AAP highlights Albanese will get his meeting (depending on world events and Trump’s mood) in Kananaskis, Alberta, on Tuesday local time.\n\nHeading into the meeting with topics such as tariff exemptions, the future of AUKUS, and global unrest no doubt top of mind, the PM told business leaders in Seattle on Saturday: “The combination of Australia and the United States when we’re working together is an unbeatable combination.”\n\nThe Australian Financial Review reports Albanese will push back on demands from the US to ratchet up its defence budget when he meets with the president. The paper also quotes the PM as saying he was sure the Middle East would “be a topic of conversation” during the leaders’ meeting, but there was no expectation Australia would be asked to provide Israel with military support.\n\nBefore Albanese talks to Trump, he will hold bilateral talks with a series of other world leaders, including the host, Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney. AAP states the pair are expected to discuss tariffs (most likely how to navigate Trump’s demands), defence, critical minerals, climate change and the situation in the Middle East.\n\nWhile in Seattle over the weekend, Albanese visited Amazon’s cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services. On that theme, The Australian reports the prime minister “is facing internal dissent over Amazon’s access to lucrative public contracts … while three ministers are among at least 17 government MPs who have accused the company of exploiting its workers”.\n\nThe paper says the “internal disquiet” comes as Communication Minister Anika Wells prepares to sign off “one of the biggest federal government contracts with the company — a deal with the National Broadband Network to deliver satellite internet services to the bush”.\n\nThe broadsheet also reports on the fact the Reserve Bank of Australia will now reveal how its board members vote on interest rate decisions, although it won’t name them. The Nine papers have also picked up the story, saying the change is part of the reforms to the central bank about to be finalised by Treasurer Jim Chalmers and RBA governor Michele Bullock.\n\nThe papers point out the move will bring the RBA “largely in line with central banks around the world”, with those in favour of the change saying it will improve decision-making. The changes will see the vote decision made public in the case of a split decision by the board.\n\nThe Nine papers also point out that the financial markets are currently putting the chance of another rate cut at the next RBA board meeting in July at 97%. The AFR, meanwhile, says the Israeli strikes on Iranian energy infrastructure are causing concern “that a longer-term oil price spike will fuel inflation and derail hopes of interest rate cuts”.\n\nThe AAP reports this morning that tariffs and global conflict have knocked Australians’ optimism in the economy and trust in the US to 20-year lows.\n\n“Australians are clearly unsettled by what they’ve seen of the second Trump administration, with almost two-thirds (64%) now holding little to no trust in the United States to act responsibly — the lowest level in the history of the Lowy Institute Poll,” the institute’s executive director Michael Fullilove said.\n\nGuardian Australia over the weekend reported: “An Australian man who was detained upon arrival at Los Angeles airport and deported back to Melbourne says United States border officials told him it was due to his writing on pro-Palestine protests by university students.”\n\nON A LIGHTER NOTE…\n\nA museum in Italy has called on visitors to “respect art” after a chair covered in hundreds of crystals was broken.\n\nLast week, the Palazzo Maffei in Verona released footage of a couple taking pictures of each other pretending to sit on artwork by Italian artist Nicola Bolla, known as the “Van Gogh” chair, the BBC reports. The video, which has gone viral, shows the man slipping and falling on the chair.\n\nMuseum director Vanessa Carlon said of the incident: “Sometimes we lose our brains to take a picture, and we don’t think about the consequences.\n\n“Of course it was an accident, but these two people left without speaking to us — that isn’t an accident. This is a nightmare for any museum”.\n\nThe BBC reports the museum has notified the police, but the pair have yet to be identified.\n\nMike, I have to go. I am taking a call from Putin.Donald Trump\n\nThe US president spoke to The Atlantic’s Michael Scherer on Saturday (his 79th birthday) ahead of his heavily debated military parade. Trump attempted to counter the criticism levelled at him by the likes of Tucker Carlson, as well as trying to defend his promised ability to end conflicts around the world, as more rage every day.\n\nCRIKEY RECAP\n\nREAD ALL ABOUT IT\n\nAir India plane crash death toll rises to 270 (BBC)\n\nAuthorities still searching for suspect in shooting of two Minnesota state lawmakers (Associated Press)\n\nAt least eight killed near Gaza food sites as Palestinians fear global attention switching to Iran (The Guardian)\n\nAnti-tourism protests break out in Spain, Italy and Portugal (Sky News)\n\nThe Clintons and Kamala Harris descend on a Hamptons wedding of liberal royalty (The New York Times) ($)\n\nTHE COMMENTARIAT\n\nTrump loves playing toy soldiers, but it is not a game – The Herald’s View (The Sydney Morning Herald): Few seemed to notice the ironies: Trump glories in military might, yet was medically exempt from serving in Vietnam in 1968 after a foot doctor and friendly family business associate diagnosed heel spurs; he later attacked Republican rival John McCain, a navy flyer and POW at the Hanoi Hilton, saying, “He’s not a war hero. He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren’t captured.” The $69 million parade comes just months after Trump slashed funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n\nMeanwhile, as Trump bathed in birthday adulation, protests erupted across the US with the “No Kings” group adding a personal anti-authoritarian slap in the face to the president for defying court orders and questionable deportations.\n\nIsrael’s attacks on Iran are already hurting global oil prices, and the impact is set to worsen — Joaquin Vespignani (The Conversation): The weekend attacks on Iran’s oil facilities — widely seen as part of escalating hostilities between Israel and Iran — represent a dangerous moment for global energy security.\n\nWhile the physical damage to Iran’s production facilities is still being assessed, the broader strategic implications are already rippling through global oil markets.
