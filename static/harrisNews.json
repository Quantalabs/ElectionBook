Email tips@dailymail.com By Chloe Louise For Mailonline Published:00:53 BST, 26 August 2024 |Updated:01:07 BST, 26 August 2024 e-mail View comments Nick Knowles is understood to be in the red just 12-months after launching a new business with his fiancée Katie Dadzie. The couple have branched into the competitive lingerie and sex toy trade, but the company they set up a year ago is believed to be losing money, reports the Sun. Figures show their company, Boa Boa - for which they are listed as company directors and have a 50 percent share - is £15,203 in the red after its first year of trading. As well as sexy lingerie, the brand also flogs sex toys including vibrators and lubricants. Their website, which has assets of £34,000 but still have bills to pay, says its undies 'can make us feel sexy, confident, and playful . . . and we want to help you feel that way!' Nick Knowles has reportedly started a business venture as him and his fiancée Katie Dadzie has started selling sexy lingerie But while the DIY SOS star, 61, and Katie, 34, (pictured) appear happy with their latest side they are believed to be losing money according to the Sun. Katie has turned heads by modelling its lingerie as her fans have continuously showered her with adoration and support. After sharing a candid clip of her relaxing on a bed in one of the company's two-pieces, her followers flocked to her comment box. It comes after Nick proved he was a man on a mission as headed to the gym amid his bid to slim down for Strictly Come Dancing. He was revealed to be part of the lineup this month and recently informed fans that he'd already lost a stone while trying to get fit for the show. His weight loss adds to the 2.5 stone he lost earlier in the year when he shed his lockdown pounds. He spoke out about his weight loss on This Morning in June, when Ben Shephard said he didn't expect Nick to be so agile while rock climbing. Laughing, Nick replied: 'No, I am 61 and you will have noticed, the newspapers, they pointed out, I put on a lot of weight during lockdown. 'I have lost about two and a half stone of it, I have got another stone to go.' It is said that figures show their company, Boa Boa, are £15,203 in the red after the first year of trading. The duo are co-directors of the firm and both reportedly have a 50 percent share Katie has turned heads by modelling its lingerie as her fans have continuously showered her with adoration and support Revealing the reason he signed up to Strictly, Nick said: 'I danced in Rio last year doing an Argentine Tango and I thought this is great. My elder sister was a ballroom dancer so I am the least talented person in the family.

Nick is a television presenter, writer and musician. He is best known for his presenting roles on the BBC, including game shows Who Dares Wins, Break the Safe and 5-Star Family Reunion. While Nick is being kept busy working out and training for Strictly he has also become a landlord after putting his idyllic Cotswold cottage up for rent for £1,600 a month. The presenter moved back into the property around 2017 after giving up 80 percent of his belongings for a simpler life. But Nick has made the decision to put his home on the rental market as he marks the next step in his relationship with Katie after their engagement last year. The semi detached property features an open plan kitchen/ living area complete with a log burner. Nick's love for gardening is clear to see as raised sleepers filled with flowers flank the front driveway while he has his own kitchen garden in the back. The garden overlooks stunning views of the Cotswolds countryside. Over the years, Nick has shared insights into his Cotswolds life on Instagram. Back in 2020, he reflected on giving up his London home to move out to the countryside. He wrote: 'In the Cotswolds deep mid winter. 'I chose to leave London, my home most of my life, almost three years ago - on days like today I feel blessed to have made that choice. I'm aware I'm very lucky to live here. 'So many people say they would love to live elsewhere abroad in the winter but I love the winters, the log fires and the hot chocolate with marshmallows... and I'm still joyful as a child every time it snows'. Nick was recently seen stopping off at a garden centre with Katie. The couple filled the car with plants, with the presenter seemingly keen to get to work on her garden. The presenter previously spoke about why he decided to downsize and get rid of most of his belongings.

Nick's love for gardening is clear to see as raised sleepers in the back He said on This Morning: 'I decided to change my life because I woke up one morning and went looking for my watch. 'I was living in a big house on my own and I went into a room I hadn't been into for a year and I thought 'well that's ridiculous'.' 'I chucked away 80% of my belongings and moved to a tiny little cottage in the countryside, because I've got a little boy and I wanted to make real memories.' He then went onto recall fond memories from his childhood, saying that he remembers the sentimental moments with his family rather than the size of the home he grew up in. 'My real memories when I was little were things like picking pea-pods in the back garden with my uncle and my dad and going for walks in the woods, it didn't actually have anything to do with the size of my house.' Nick has four children - three sons and a daughter. His youngest son Freddie was born in 2014 during his marriage to Jessica Rose Moor.

The Democratic gathering, which featured speeches from party heavyweights including Harris, President Joe Biden, and former President Barack Obama, drew in millions of viewers across traditional broadcast networks and cable news channels.Newsweek contacted both the Harris and Trump campaign via email for comment on Sunday.The opening night of the DNC set the tone with an impressive 20 million viewers, surpassing both the 2020 DNC opener (19.7 million) and this year's RNC kickoff (18.1 million). Day two of the convention saw viewership climb to nearly 20.8 million, with a notable spike to 21.9 million during Barack Obama's prime-time address. The convention's third day maintained steady viewership with 20.2 million tuning in, again outpacing the RNC's corresponding night, which attracted 18 million viewers.The final night of the DNC saw a significant surge in viewership, with 26.2 million Americans watching as Kamala Harris formally accepted the Democratic presidential nomination. The audience peaked at 28.9 million during Harris' acceptance speech, surpassing the RNC's final night viewership of 25.4 million and its peak of 28.4 million during Trump's address.Demographics played a significant role in the viewership patterns. The DNC attracted a considerable older audience, with 15.3 million viewers aged 55 and above tuning in. The 35-54 age bracket accounted for 3.5 million viewers, while the 18-34 demographic drew in 851,000 viewers.Alyssa Farah Griffin, who served as White House director of strategic communications under Trump's administration, commented on CNN's The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, \"I know Donald Trump was not happy about that. It's a big deal. I think it speaks to that six in 10 Americans who didn't want the Biden-Trump rematch. Now, there's someone new, there's someone energizing. There's someone who would be historic if she wins.\"The DNC averaged 21.8 million viewers across all four nights, outshining the RNC's average of just over 19 million viewers. This success has brought a wave of momentum to the Democratic Party, which was once slightly trailing Trump while President Joe Biden was still atop the ticket.Griffin also praised the DNC for being \"a well-orchestrated convention that was a mixture of different kinds of policies, a mix of national security, having speakers from all over the country.\" She added, \"I think it held viewers' attention. But 75 days [until Election Day] is a long time. Donald Trump is a master at reclaiming the spotlight and getting eyeballs back on him.\"The convention's strong performance comes at a crucial time for the Democrats. Before Biden stepped aside as the Democratic presidential nominee on July 21, polling found that a majority of Americans didn't want a rematch between Trump and Biden. A January poll by Reuters revealed that around 67 percent of respondents were \"tired of seeing the same candidates in presidential elections and want someone new.\"Harris' historic nomination as the first Black and Asian American woman to lead a major party ticket has energized the Democratic base. The convention featured a diverse array of speakers, from Hollywood stars like Mindy Kaling to notable leaders like former President Barack Obama and ex-first lady Michelle Obama.Trump reacted to Harris' speech live over his Truth Social account, repeatedly criticizing the vice president on her promised border policies.

Vance’s comments come after Democrats spent night after night of their national convention in Chicago last week assailing Trump for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion in the United States and paving the way for bans and restrictions across Republican-led states. But efforts to try to neutralize an issue that Democrats hope will galvanize voters this fall also risk alienating parts of Trump’s base opposed to abortion rights. “God have mercy on this nation if this is now the position of what was the Pro-Life Party,” wrote Family Research Council president Tony Perkins in a post Sunday linking to a story on Vance’s comments. While Trump has repeatedly boasted about his role in overturning Roe, he has, in recent days, pushed back on Democrats’ warnings that he will go even further to restrict access if he wins a second term. “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” he wrote Friday on his Truth Social platform, appropriating language used by abortion rights activists and the left. His comments drew a wave of criticism from anti-abortion advocates, including the editor of the conservative National Review, which published an article titled “Trump’s Abandonment of Pro-Lifers Is Complete.” Trump repeated his claim hours later at an event in Las Vegas. “I’m very strong on women’s reproductive rights. The IVF (in vitro fertilization), very strong. I mean, we’re leaders in it. And I think people are seeing that,” he told reporters. Democrats have responded to Trump with deep skepticism. “American women are not stupid and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion for women all across this country,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told NBC. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., brushed off a question asking how Trump would be “great’ on reproductive rights. “You need to ask him about that. What I would say is that President Trump was a very good pro-life president,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The pro-life community,” Graham said,, “is organized around the well-being of the child, giving the mother options other than an abortion.” Graham said “that movement will continue after he’s gone.” Trump has often struggled to talk about abortion. Before he entered politics, he had described himself as “very pro-choice.” Earlier this year, he grappled with his stance on a federal abortion ban, suggesting at one point that he would support one at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. He then settled on his current position: That restrictions should be left to individual states. Trump has not said how he plans to vote on an upcoming ballot measure on Florida’s six-week ban. In an interview with CBS News earlier in the week, Trump said he had “no regrets” about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade. But after months of confusing statements, he said he would not use a federal law known as the Comstock Act to try to ban the distribution of medication that is used as an alternative to surgical abortions. That is something that some of his allies have urged and that Vance supported in the past. “We will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no,” he said. “I would not do that.” “It’s going to be available and it is now. And as I know it, the Supreme Court has said: ‘Keep it going the way it is.’ I will enforce and agree with the Supreme Court, but basically they’ve said, keep it the way it is now,” he said. Abortion has been a powerful motivator for Democrats since the Roe decision in the summer of 2022, and the party expects it to continue to play a key role this year. On stage at the Democratic convention, women told harrowing personal stories of having to carry unviable pregnancies to term and being denied miscarriage care, putting their future fertility at risk. “This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in her speech accepting her party’s nomination. Trump, who had been responding to the speech in real time, falsely insisted that, “Everybody, Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, and Conservatives, wanted Roe v. Wade TERMINATED, and brought back to the States.”","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nNEW YORK – Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance says Donald Trump&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Vance claims Trump will reject bill proposing federal abortion prohibition first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/local-news/vance-claims-trump-will-reject-bill-proposing-federal-abortion-prohibition/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/1724630275_rewrite-this-title-Trump-would-veto-legislation-establishing-a-federal.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 23:58:48","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.052},{"id":254906738,"title":"Drone attack kills at least 21 civilians in northern Mali, Tuareg-led group says","text":"CTVNews.ca Top Stories Toronto police release new photo of man wanted for murder in deaths of two relatives Toronto police have released a new photo of a 33-year-old man they are seeking in connection with the deaths of his two female relatives.

Lionel McGloin, who runs the ‘no cap on god’ YouTube page, spent the week in Chicago and talked to some of the big stars of the DNC and spoofed the ‘brat’ theme of many Kamala Harris supporters. His best answers came from some of the average attendees, including one who said ‘yes queen’ to ideas as wild as free abortions, gender-affirming care for minors and higher tax brackets for rich white men. However, to show the groupthink of liberals, he got New York Congressman Jerry Nadler to agree to something similar in the same video. ‘If we have a Democratic Congress, we certainly will,’ Nadler told McGloin. One male attendee explained to McGloin why Harris appeals to liberals. ‘She’s brat,’ he said, referencing the Charli XCX album that has become a meme among the left. ‘Brat is like, you’re a party girl but you go out really late at night and you fall asleep with your makeup on,’ the man said. But by far, the funniest answers came from some of the progressive attendees, including one who couldn’t decide between living in a democracy or legalizing abortion. ‘I feel like that’s almost not possible to answer, I couldn’t pick one or the other,’ she said, before leaning toward abortion access over democracy. He later asks one woman a series of ‘yes queen’ or no queen’ questions about whether she’d want free abortions, gender-affirming care for migrants, banned standardized testing and higher taxes for rich white men. Another young woman dished on the secret of working in Democrat politics in Washington is that Republican men are more attractive the left-leaning ones, but the GOP men ‘are evil’. McGloin also spoke to both Kellyanne Conway and her daughter Claudia, who revealed she was going against her ex-Trump advisor mother to endorse Harris. The host at one point got Massachusetts Senator Ed Markey to consider legalizing cocaine. Overall, the progressives seemed to have fallen in line with what California Governor Gavin Newsom joked was a ’30-minute primary’ to support Harris unconditionally. They’ve also fallen in line on the ‘brat’ meme in support of Harris, a key organ in the fight against Donald Trump among Gen Z. More than 41 million Gen Z voters will be eligible to cast ballots in the 2024 election across the country including more than eight million young voters who are newly eligible to vote since the 2022 midterms. It’s the first presidential election playing out on TikTok and with more online influencers and streaming options than ever before, so the campaigns are utilizing many avenues to reach the next generation where they are. It’s an extremely diverse generation. Nearly half of Gen Z youths are people of color. One in five identifies as LGBTQ+. Not only are they more diverse, they participate. As Democrats and Republicans work on engaging young people, an exclusive new poll for DailyMail.com shows Harris is seeing a surge in support when it comes to voters ages 18 to 29 compared to when President Biden topped the Democratic ticket. It found 48 percent of young voters now back Harris while just 32 percent back Trump. 9 percent support independent candidate Robert Kennedy Jr. When the same polling was conducted in July, Harris had 37 percent support and Trump had 26 percent support, the poll conducted by J.L. Partners found. With that, the campaigns are taking multiple approaches to reaching the key group of voters. As President Biden exited the presidential race and Harris took over the top of the Democratic ticket, TikTok and other social media platforms have been a huge asset in the first few weeks of her campaign. It was as if the internet was taken over by supporters using coconut emojis and palm trees as older voters had to ask their kids and younger colleagues what it means to be ‘brat’ following pop star Charlie XCX’s endorsement on X ‘Kamala IS brat.’ The @KamalaHQ account now has more than 3.4 million followers with its following doubling overnight on from Sunday, July 21 to Monday, July 22 after Biden’s exit, according to the campaign. Its number of followers has grown to more than eight times what it was when it was @BidenHQ, making the @KamalaHQ TikTok the most followed Harris social media asset of her entire campaign. With its rebranding, @KamalaHQ has pulled in more total views on TikTok than Donald Trump’s account with more than 462 million video views and 66 million likes. The campaign is using a mix of viral moments and trends in an effort to break through to voters across platforms in a fragmented media environment. Behind the humor and memes, the campaign said it is focused on forcing a visual contrast between Harris and Trump.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA prankster infiltrated the Democrat National Convention and coaxed some shocking answers&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: A prankster reveals the disturbing behaviors of a group during a funny video, featuring a brainwashed girl giving absurd responses. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/a-prankster-reveals-the-disturbing-behaviors-of-a-group-during-a-funny-video-featuring-a-brainwashed-girl-giving-absurd-responses/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-DNC-cult-exposed-by-prankster-in-hilarious.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 23:48:50","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.011},{"id":254906586,"title":"Honeymoon cash: Harris team reports $540M haul","text":"In the just-more-than a month since Vice President Kamala Harris stepped into the political limelight her campaign for the White House has raised an historic $540 million. According to the Harris Walz campaign, that sizable amount is “a record for any campaign in history.” “Not only are our volunteers doing the work, but this week we saw unprecedented grassroots donations. Just before Vice President Harris’ acceptance speech Thursday night, we officially crossed the $500 million mark. Immediately after her speech, we saw our best fundraising hour since launch day,” the campaign said in a Sunday morning memo. According to the Harris camp, a third of the donations made to the campaign are from first-time political donors, most of whom are women. “Almost one-fifth of those first-time contributors were young voters and two-thirds of which were women — both of which are poised to be deciding constituencies in November,” the campaign said. “Teachers and nurses also continue to be among the most common donor occupations.” The campaign used the convention, they say, to launch a massive organizing effort. Volunteers agreed to staff more than 200,000 shifts in the coming weeks aimed at mobilizing voters, they said, and that’s after volunteers completed 10,000 shifts in the days leading up to the Democratic National Convention and contacted more than one million voters. “On Thursday and Friday alone, volunteers signed up for 90,000 shifts, motivated by the extraordinary excitement around the Vice President’s speech. We head into September with a virtual army of volunteers ready to do the hard work of talking to their neighbors, friends and colleagues. Meanwhile, Donald Trump’s battleground infrastructure remains incredibly sparse,” the campaign wrote. Trump has proven to be a formidable fundraiser, but appears to be outpaced in her month-old campaign. Trump’s campaign and its related affiliates announced earlier this month that they had raised $138.7 million in July — less than what Harris took in during her White House bid’s opening week. Trump’s campaign reported $327 million in cash on hand at the start of August. Trump is scheduled to address the National Guard Association of the United States’ at their 146th General Conference and Exhibition in Detroit, Michigan on Monday, and he’s set to give remarks in Grand Rapids on Tuesday. Trump will stop in Potterville, Michigan, and La Crosse, Wisconsin, on Thursday. Trump has a rally schedule for Friday in Johnstown, Pennsylvania. According to Trump’s MAGA 2024 campaign pollsters, Tony Fabrizio and Travis Tunis, the enthusiasm suddenly seen behind Harris’s campaign is nothing more than the “honeymoon” period following her ascension to the top of the ticket. The “Harris honeymoon,” they say, will eventually fade. “We’ve certainly had a front row seat to the ‘honeymoon.’ In fact, the Media decided to extend the honeymoon for over 4 weeks now,” they said in a statement. “But even after all the fawning coverage of Harris and negative coverage of President Trump, we find this race fundamentally tied.” As of Sunday there were 72 days left until the November 5 general election. According to polling averages maintained by RealClearPolitics and 538, Harris leads Trump by 1.5% and 3.6%, respectively.","summary":"“We’ve certainly had a front row seat to the 'honeymoon.'

The sibling's fractious relationship came to a head in 2009, after a backstage fight in Paris led to Noel, 57, leaving the iconic Britpop band. In recent years, Liam, 51, has been keen to make amends with his brother and reform Oasis, but his older brother poured cold water on the idea. But as Liam closed his set at Reading Festival he teased that an announcement could be made on Tuesday at 8:00am. A short clip of a sign in the style of Oasis logo was projected on a large screen above the stage and subsequently shared to Oasis and Liam's official Instagram and X accounts.

They know this reunion will go down in music history'. MailOnline have contacted Noel and Liam's reps for comment. Oasis has been promised a payday of £50 million to reform and embark on a global tour. After Noel's £20m divorce from ex-wife Sara MacDonald last year, the elder Gallagher is said to have been persuaded of the financial merits of getting the band together for dates at Glastonbury and Wembley Stadium. It is expected to be the most popular tour in British concert history, with industry insiders saying the deal negotiated between the brothers will net them £50 million. During his headline slot at Reading on Sunday night, Liam, 51, performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary. Introducing Half The World Away - a 1994 B-side that also featured as the theme tune to sitcom The Royle Family - he told revellers: 'I wanna dedicate this song to Noel f**king Gallagher.' A source said: 'Noel and Liam are never going to be the best of friends but they want to bring Oasis back for the fans' (pictured 1999) Before adding: 'He spoke to Liam on the phone and they are on the same page. They know this reunion will go down in music history' (pictured 2003) During his headline slot at Reading on Sunday night, Liam performed a number of Oasis hits from their debut album Definitely Maybe to celebrate its 30th anniversary Liam continued to keep fans guessing by dedicating his rendition of Cigarettes & Alcohol at the Reading Festival to people who hate Oasis. The track, written by his older brother, was the final single on their 1994 debut album Definitely Maybe. As he closed the set, Liam suggested an announcement could be made on Tuesday at 8:00am. A short clip of a sign in the style of Oasis logo was projected on a large screen above the stage and subsequently shared to Oasis and Liam's official Instagram and X accounts. The white rectangular box which a black block in the centre had the date \"27.08.24'' written in the middle where the band's name is usually seen. It then flickered and changed to read \"8am''. Liam has been touring the UK this summer on his Definitely Maybe tour to celebrate the 30 years since its release in 1994. Noel has been notably absent from the concerts, but during a show in Cardiff Liam made a point of dedicating Half The World Away to his 'little brother', saying he is 'still playing hard to get'.

By this logic, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg must be tough on crime, too. Far more telling is her support for bailing out the 2020 George Floyd rioters, endorsing a bail fund that put violent repeat offenders back on the streets of Minneapolis. “Chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota,” she tweeted as the city burned (and as Gov. Tim Walz dithered on the mayor’s request to send in the National Guard). That endorsement helped the Minnesota Freedom Fund raise $40 million, cash it soon used to release accused murderers, rapists, and thieves. In keeping with how Black Lives Matter nonprofits operate, only a tiny fraction of that largesse went to freeing simple protesters. Among the sketchy recipients of the MFF bail funds: Darnika Floyd got out on $100,000 after being accused of stabbing a man who refused to have sex with her; in 2021 she was convicted and sent to prison. Christopher Boswell, a convicted rapist, was facing 10 felony counts including attempted rape, sexual assault and kidnapping against two women when he got released on $350,000 bail; those charges were later dropped, but he was convicted last year for heinous felonies committed in 2022 Bailed out in August 2021 on a domestic abuse charge, George Howard weeks later murdered Luis Martinez Ortiz in a road-rage incident; he pleaded guilty last year. MFF bailed out Lionel Timms on charges of violently pummeling a bus rider who refused to give him money; a month later, he was arrested for leaving his victim with a traumatic brain injury. In 2021, he was convicted and sentenced to five years in prison for felony assault. Despite the MFF’s dismal record, Harris hasn’t deleted her tweet endorsing the bail fund — which means she still stands by it, or at the very least doesn’t dare cross the hard left by deleting it. It’s also telling that she picked Walz as her running mate despite his sorry record on crime, and not only during the 2020 riots: In his time as governor, Minnesota’s gone from well below the national average on serious crime to above it. As on everything else, Kamala Harris hasn’t deigned to announce any actual policies on crime, but every signal she has sent is fresh reason to vote against her.","summary":"Vice President Kamala Harris helped the Minnesota Freedom Fund raise $40 million, cash it soon used to release accused murderers, rapists, and thieves.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/08/25/opinion/kamala-harris-support-for-bail-fund-that-freed-violent-criminals-shows-how-tough-on-crime-she-really-is/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/08/u-s-vice-president-democratic-88065308-e1724361886953.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/OrzImW7S-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-25 23:26:52","author":"Post Editorial Board","authors":["Post Editorial Board"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.452},{"id":254906734,"title":"Walz's exit from Minnesota National Guard left openings for critics to pounce on his military record","text":"WASHINGTON - John Kolb, a retired Minnesota National Guard colonel, knew Tim Walz by reputation as an “excellent leader” who adroitly guided the enlisted troops in his field artillery battalion. But Kolb was stunned by what he saw when Walz left the military and entered politics. Walz retired from the National Guard in 2005 to run for U.S. Congress just before his unit received an order to mobilize for the war in Iraq. Then during the campaign, Walz overstated the rank he held at the point he left the service. “That is not the behavior I would expect out of a senior noncommissioned officer,” Kolb said in an interview. Those two sides of Walz’s service have been in the spotlight now that the Minnesota governor is the Democratic nominee for vice president. Supporters have lauded Walz’s 24 years of service in the National Guard, where he rose through the enlisted ranks and received an honorable discharge. “What I know about Tim Walz is he did his job diligently,” said retired Minnesota National Guard Brig. Gen. Jeff Bertrang. “He was in charge of troops under him, and he made sure they were taken care of.” Republicans have seized on criticism by Guard veterans as a major line of attack on Walz and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Some of that criticism, like Kolb’s, is measured. Others offer harsher appraisals. It’s far from clear whether Republicans can turn Walz’s military record into a liability. His decades of service stand in contrast with former U.S. president Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who received a series of deferments to avoid serving in Vietnam, including one attained with a physician’s letter stating that Trump suffered from bone spurs in his feet. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, was a Marine Corps corporal, including six months as a military journalist in Iraq. After four years, he left the military for college and later a career in venture capital and as a best-selling author. Vance has led the criticism of Walz. Download the CTV News App for breaking news alerts and video on all the top stories For many Democrats, the GOP salvos are an eerie reprise of the tactics used to sully their 2004 presidential candidate, John Kerry, by questioning his leadership as a swift boat commander in Vietnam, even though Kerry was a decorated combat veteran and his Republican opponent, resident George W. Bush, did not fight in the war. But the criticism stems not so much from Walz’s service record but from how he has characterized his time in uniform and how he ended his tenure. An Associated Press review of Walz’s statements as a congressional candidate, congressman and governor shows that Walz has toggled between being precise and careless about key details. Walz’s supporters reject the criticism as politically motivated and say it denigrates the sacrifices he and other troops have made. The Harris campaign provided a letter signed by hundreds of veterans and military family members that said Vance’s broadsides against Walz are not surprising given reports that Trump expressed disdain for those who served. Trump has denied the claim. “After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform -- and as vice president of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,” the campaign said. In a speech this past week at the Democratic National Convention, Walz said he “proudly wore our nation’s uniform for 24 years.” He made no reference to his rank or the circumstances of his retirement, framing his service as part of a larger urge to “contribute” to the nation. Distinction with a difference “I’m a retired command sergeant major,” Walz said in 2006 as he campaigned to unseat the six-term Republican incumbent in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. But that statement was not true. Walz served briefly as a command sergeant major, but that was not the rank he held at retirement. It is not clear whether Walz repeated the exact claim after he won the House race, but he did not object when colleagues put the honorific before his name during House debates to underscore his gravitas on military matters. That distinction -– serving as a command sergeant major, but not retiring in that position -– may seem minor to civilians. But to those in uniform, it is not. Rank is revered in the army. Known as an E-9 in military parlance, a command sergeant major is the pinnacle of achievement in the army’s enlisted corps. Command sergeants major are the backbone of a unit, acting as mentors and disciplinarians to the enlisted troops and trusted advisers to their commanding officers. Sergeants major often stay in their units for long stretches, providing a deep well of institutional knowledge. Commissioned officers typically move on to new posts every few years. “There’s a reason why there’s so much angst about this among military members that maybe is lost on the rest of the population,” Kolb said. “The rank of command sergeant major, that E-9 rank, is sacred. It’s rare.” Walz was command sergeant major of the Minnesota Guard’s 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery for less than a year, according to the Guard’s personnel office. His rank was reduced for benefit purposes to master sergeant, a step below, when he left the Guard because Walz had not completed all the coursework necessary to hold the rank in retirement. Facing questions about Walz’s record, the Harris campaign replaced the phrase “a retired command sergeant major” from Walz’s online biography with wording that says he served as one. But Walz’s official biography on the Minnesota governor’s website is still misleading. That biography places “retired from” a Guard battalion after the phrase “Command Sergeant Major Walz.” “He’s a retired master sergeant,” Kolb said. “And that’s what he should say.” The campaign also acknowledged that Walz misspoke in a 2018 video posted on social media that recorded him saying “weapons of war that I carried in war.” Vance seized on the comment to accuse Walz of lying about being in a combat zone when he never was. Walz and other Guard troops were sent to Italy in 2003 to provide base security in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Pentagon’s name for the war in Afghanistan. Questions about Walz mischaracterizing his personal story have not been limited to military service. He is also facing scrutiny for how he has described his family’s struggle with infertility. He has implied that he and his wife used in vitro fertilization to conceive, drawing a connection between their experience and efforts to limit the procedure. But they actually used intrauterine insemination treatments, a different process that has attracted less controversy. Mia Ehrenberg, a campaign spokesperson, defended Walz’s comments and denied that he had been misleading. She said Walz “talks how normal people talk” and was using ”commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.” Leaving the Guard By military standards, Walz’s 24 years of service is substantial. He could have retired almost three years earlier. But it is the circumstances surrounding the retirement and how it overlapped with his political ambitions that have drawn scrutiny. In January 2005, Walz attended a boot camp of sorts in Minnesota for people interested in careers in progressive politics. Walz, a teacher and avid pheasant hunter with blue-collar roots, stood out as a candidate who might win in the state’s strongly Republican 1st Congressional District. Minnesota Democratic party officials had already begun to take notice of Walz. Mike Erlandson, the party’s state chair at the time, recalled the enthusiasm one of his aides brimmed with after meeting with Walz in Mankato, a town about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis where Walz taught high school geography. “He came barging into my office at the state party, saying, ’Mike, this guy Tim is the real deal,’ and was very excited about Tim Walz and the prospect of him running for Congress,” Erlandson said. By February, Walz announced that he was considering a run for Congress. But thousands of miles away, the war in Iraq had entered its third year and hopes for a speedy U.S. withdrawal were evaporating. In mid-March, Walz’s battalion was notified of a possible deployment to Iraq. In a campaign news release, Walz said he would stay in the congressional race “whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.” He had a responsibility, the release said, to ready his battalion for war “but also to serve if called on.” Follow the CTV News channel on WhatsApp Less than two months later, on May 16, 2005, Walz retired from the National Guard. His departure was not unusual. More than 730 senior enlisted soldiers with 24 years of service retired in 2005 when the U.S. was heavily engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to Defense Department statistics. But Doug Julin, a Minnesota Guard command sergeant major senior to Walz, told CNN on Aug. 8 that Walz had assured him just weeks before that Walz would be going forward with the battalion. Julin, who did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press, said he was surprised to learn Walz left the Guard without first discussing the decision with him.

(Courtesy Thomas Behrends via AP) Kolb picked Tom Behrends, who has emerged as Walz's most biting critic, to replace Walz as the 1st Battalion’s command sergeant major. The unit received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq in mid-July 2005 and a few months later headed to Mississippi for training. The unit shipped to Iraq in March 2006 where it would spend the next 16 months. Later that year, Walz, unopposed in the Democratic primary, would pull off an upset, beating Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht. Questions about Walz’s military record had percolated during that campaign. A letter to the editor in the Mankato Free Press newspaper from a person identified as Maj. Walter Gates said information about Walz’s military career strongly suggested that Walz had fought in Iraq or Afghanistan. To which country did Walz “deploy downrange”? Gates asked. Walz responded by saying the letter appeared to be an attempt to “slander my good name.” Walz wrote, incorrectly, that he retired as a command sergeant major, but accurately specified that he served on three NATO training missions and in Italy. Walz was equally clear about his wartime service in a 2009 interview with the Library of Congress’s Veterans History Project. Gates did not respond to multiple messages from the AP so it is unclear what information he was referring to. Walz, in the early 2005 campaign news release, did not mention Italy when he said he deployed for eight months in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, phrasing that could imply he served in Afghanistan. A 2006 congressional campaign ad described Walz as a soldier who had served for two decades and was “ready when they attacked.” Joe Eustice, who took over for Behrends as the 1st Battalion’s top enlisted soldier, said Walz was entitled to leave the Guard when he did. “When you’ve given 24 years of your life, you get to decide, and your reasoning can be whatever you want it to be,” said Eustice, who retired in 2014. But he is troubled by Walz’s statements after he left the Guard. “He should answer to the fact that he said he carried a weapon in war and explain why he’s been saying he’s a retired sergeant major,” Eustice said. “Those two things are not true, and he should know better.” A longtime foe Almost two decades have passed since Behrends hurriedly took Walz’s place as the 1st Battalion's senior enlisted soldier. Yet time has not eased Behrends' anger at his predecessor. As Walz’s political career flourished, Kolb advised Behrends to let go of the resentment. But Behrends could not. Not when he read and heard Walz inaccurately referred to as a retired command sergeant major – and Walz failed to set the record straight. After yet another local newspaper elevated Walz’s retirement rank, Behrends wrote to the then-congressman. “It saddens me that after your long career in the National Guard, that you did not fulfill the conditions of your promotion to command sergeant major,\" he told Walz. \"I would hope that you haven’t been using the rank for political gain, but that is how it appears.” Behrends said he did not get a reply. When Walz ran for governor two years later, Behrends went public with much stronger criticism. A self-described “down-home country boy,” Behrends did not like Walz personally. They are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Behrends is a conservative who donated US$250 to Trump's 2020 presidential campaign and supported Walz's Republican opponents in Minnesota. While they were both still in uniform, Behrends grew weary of what he said were Walz’s frequent monologues that at times veered into hot-button issues like abortion. “It was like listening to a long-winded preacher,” he said. America Votes: Latest U.S. election news and analysis from a Canadian perspective Shortly before votes were cast in Minnesota's gubernatorial election, Behrends hung a large yellow banner from a grain bin on his farm that read, “Walz Is A Traitor.” Behrends and a fellow retired command sergeant major, Paul Herr, paid to publish a letter in a Minnesota newspaper claiming that Walz had for years “embellished and selectively omitted facts and circumstances” about his military career. In an interview, Behrends said his personal distaste for Walz and his liberal politics played no role in his decision to openly denigrate the vice presidential nominee. Behrends said he would have done the same to a friend if he believed that friend had stepped out of line. Mattise reported from Nashville, Tenn., Daniel from New York and Karnowski from Minneapolis.

The soon-to-be vice president hugged his son Beau. He spoke about how his own parents had endowed him with a sense of grit and tenacity. “Champ, when you get knocked down, get up,” he recalled his father, Joe, saying. Biden then repeated the lesson taught to him by his mother, Catherine Eugenia Finnegan Biden, who was seated in the audience: “Failure at some point in your life is inevitable, but giving up is unforgivable.” In 2024, Biden was not forced to reconcile a failure of his presidency. He compiled a list of significant accomplishments that will be felt for years. But he chose to give up his campaign under pressure from Democratic leaders, in a remarkable concession to the passage of time, when allies in his party and a clear majority of United States (US) adults concluded the 81-year-old should not seek re-election. After Biden’s decision to leave the presidential race, his party not only forgave him, its leaders praised him. So Joseph Robinette Biden Jr went to the Democratic National Convention in Chicago last week both revered and resigned. Biden had consolidated his party’s support and did not have a serious competitor. But that support crumbled after a disastrous debate in June when his frailties were on unsparing public display, reinforcing his greatest liability – that at his age he might no longer be up for the job. In Chicago, Biden decided to get back up and show the difference between stepping aside and quitting. His vice president, Kamala Harris, is now in the spotlight as the nominee. For the president, it’s the latest in a life marked by the cycles of loss and recovery. “He has had wonderful things happen to him and he has had terrible things happen to him,” said Ted Kaufman, his friend, former aide and appointed successor in the Senate from Delaware. Biden arrived at the White House with a hope that a focus on the public good could help heal the partisan malice that emerged with the ascent of former President Donald Trump, now again the Republican nominee. No one denied the ego necessary to pursue the White House. But those interviewed stressed that Biden sees his legacy more as a leader who could demonstrate during a cynical era that government was a force for good. “It’s less about him,” said assistant to the president and the White House staff secretary Stefanie Feldman. “He wants people to understand that the federal government is delivering results.” Biden deployed his decades in the Senate to forge a bipartisan infrastructure deal. He signed into law far-reaching investments in advanced technologies and brokered a debt deal with Republicans to avoid a catastrophic default. Biden last week stressed that he was reducing prices on 10 of Medicare’s costliest prescription drugs. He also helped to restore the faith of longtime allies that the US could be an unflinching partner, and led the effort to provide much needed backing for its allies. He dealt with a pandemic, inflation, immigration challenges, a broken supply chain and a troubled withdrawal from Afghanistan. “The experience he brought to the job – there’s no question – gave him the ability to achieve things that no one thought he could achieve,” said Anita Dunn, who worked as a senior adviser. “It’s not just experience though. It’s relationships. It’s understanding how Congress works and how members of Congress can be brought along to get things done.” But Americans consistently saw not the accrued wisdom, but the stiff-legged, shuffling steps and the verbal struggles. Born too early to qualify as a Baby Boomer, the arc of Biden’s political career has been full of remarkable successes and staggering defeats. He was elected to the Senate from Delaware at 29, only to lose his wife and daughter in a car crash. He found a new partner in Jill and sought the presidency in the 1988 cycle, only to withdraw after reports of plagiarism. Then he dealt with serious health issues, surviving two brain aneurysms. His 2008 presidential campaign was a washout, but he became President Barack Obama’s trusted number two. Then Beau died of brain cancer and his other son, Hunter, succumbed to drug addiction. Against long odds, Biden won the Democratic nomination in 2020 and then beat Trump, only to have his party want someone else to run against his predecessor this year. Aides have recalled Biden being told years before that China’s economic growth would be a positive because it would lower prices for consumers, even if it meant that more manufacturing would move overseas. “If it helps the consumer and hurts the worker, we have a problem,” Biden told them at the time. Biden was so focused on middle-class jobs that he found his presidency, ironically, defined by the public’s desire for lower prices. Inflation was a symptom of global disruptions caused by the pandemic and war, as well as government spending meant to stabilise the economy for workers that helped spur a historic burst of hiring. The tough logic is that Biden anchored his presidency with an eye toward what America could be like a decade from now.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/bidens-journey/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PAGE-22-A_26082024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 23:02:38","author":null,"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.173},{"id":254905592,"title":"Trump says Musk wouldn't have time to be in his White House cabinet, but could 'consult'","text":"Former President Donald Trump said that Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk likely couldn't serve in his hypothetical White House cabinet due to the demanding schedule of running his various companies. \"He wants to be involved.

Vance’s comments come after Democrats spent night after night of their national convention in Chicago last week assailing Trump for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion in the United States and paving the way for bans and restrictions across Republican-led states. But efforts to try to neutralize an issue that Democrats hope will galvanize voters this fall also risk alienating parts of Trump’s base opposed to abortion rights. “God have mercy on this nation if this is now the position of what was the Pro-Life Party,” wrote Family Research Council president Tony Perkins in a post Sunday linking to a story on Vance’s comments. While Trump has repeatedly boasted about his role in overturning Roe, he has, in recent days, pushed back on Democrats’ warnings that he will go even further to restrict access if he wins a second term. “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” he wrote Friday on his Truth Social platform, appropriating language used by abortion rights activists and the left. His comments drew a wave of criticism from anti-abortion advocates, including the editor of the conservative National Review, which published an article titled “Trump’s Abandonment of Pro-Lifers Is Complete.” Trump repeated his claim hours later at an event in Las Vegas. “I’m very strong on women’s reproductive rights. The IVF (in vitro fertilization), very strong. I mean, we’re leaders in it. And I think people are seeing that,” he told reporters. Democrats have responded to Trump with deep skepticism. “American women are not stupid and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion for women all across this country,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told NBC. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., brushed off a question asking how Trump would be “great’ on reproductive rights. “You need to ask him about that. What I would say is that President Trump was a very good pro-life president,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The pro-life community,” Graham said,, “is organized around the well-being of the child, giving the mother options other than an abortion.” Graham said “that movement will continue after he’s gone.” Trump has often struggled to talk about abortion. Before he entered politics, he had described himself as “very pro-choice.” Earlier this year, he grappled with his stance on a federal abortion ban, suggesting at one point that he would support one at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. He then settled on his current position: That restrictions should be left to individual states. Trump has not said how he plans to vote on an upcoming ballot measure on Florida’s six-week ban. In an interview with CBS News earlier in the week, Trump said he had “no regrets” about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade. But after months of confusing statements, he said he would not use a federal law known as the Comstock Act to try to ban the distribution of medication that is used as an alternative to surgical abortions. That is something that some of his allies have urged and that Vance supported in the past. “We will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no,” he said. “I would not do that.” “It’s going to be available and it is now. And as I know it, the Supreme Court has said: ‘Keep it going the way it is.’ I will enforce and agree with the Supreme Court, but basically they’ve said, keep it the way it is now,” he said. Abortion has been a powerful motivator for Democrats since the Roe decision in the summer of 2022, and the party expects it to continue to play a key role this year. On stage at the Democratic convention, women told harrowing personal stories of having to carry unviable pregnancies to term and being denied miscarriage care, putting their future fertility at risk. “This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump.

Vance’s comments come after Democrats spent night after night of their national convention in Chicago last week assailing Trump for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion in the United States and paving the way for bans and restrictions across Republican-led states. But efforts to try to neutralize an issue that Democrats hope will galvanize voters this fall also risk alienating parts of Trump’s base opposed to abortion rights. “God have mercy on this nation if this is now the position of what was the Pro-Life Party,” wrote Family Research Council president Tony Perkins in a post Sunday linking to a story on Vance’s comments. While Trump has repeatedly boasted about his role in overturning Roe, he has, in recent days, pushed back on Democrats’ warnings that he will go even further to restrict access if he wins a second term. “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” he wrote Friday on his Truth Social platform, appropriating language used by abortion rights activists and the left. His comments drew a wave of criticism from anti-abortion advocates, including the editor of the conservative National Review, which published an article titled “Trump’s Abandonment of Pro-Lifers Is Complete.” Trump repeated his claim hours later at an event in Las Vegas. “I’m very strong on women’s reproductive rights. The IVF (in vitro fertilization), very strong. I mean, we’re leaders in it. And I think people are seeing that,” he told reporters. Democrats have responded to Trump with deep skepticism. “American women are not stupid and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion for women all across this country,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told NBC. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., brushed off a question asking how Trump would be “great’ on reproductive rights. “You need to ask him about that. What I would say is that President Trump was a very good pro-life president,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The pro-life community,” Graham said,, “is organized around the well-being of the child, giving the mother options other than an abortion.” Graham said “that movement will continue after he’s gone.” Trump has often struggled to talk about abortion. Before he entered politics, he had described himself as “very pro-choice.” Earlier this year, he grappled with his stance on a federal abortion ban, suggesting at one point that he would support one at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. He then settled on his current position: That restrictions should be left to individual states. Trump has not said how he plans to vote on an upcoming ballot measure on Florida’s six-week ban. In an interview with CBS News earlier in the week, Trump said he had “no regrets” about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade. But after months of confusing statements, he said he would not use a federal law known as the Comstock Act to try to ban the distribution of medication that is used as an alternative to surgical abortions. That is something that some of his allies have urged and that Vance supported in the past. “We will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no,” he said. “I would not do that.” “It’s going to be available and it is now. And as I know it, the Supreme Court has said: ‘Keep it going the way it is.’ I will enforce and agree with the Supreme Court, but basically they’ve said, keep it the way it is now,” he said. Abortion has been a powerful motivator for Democrats since the Roe decision in the summer of 2022, and the party expects it to continue to play a key role this year. On stage at the Democratic convention, women told harrowing personal stories of having to carry unviable pregnancies to term and being denied miscarriage care, putting their future fertility at risk. “This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump.

But Kolb was stunned by what he saw when Walz left the military and entered politics. Walz retired from the National Guard in 2005 to run for Congress just before his unit received an order to mobilize for the war in Iraq. Then during the campaign, Walz overstated the rank he held at the point he left the service. “That is not the behavior I would expect out of a senior noncommissioned officer,” Kolb said in an interview. Those two sides of Walz’s service have been in the spotlight now that the Minnesota governor is the Democratic nominee for vice president. Supporters have lauded Walz’s 24 years of service in the National Guard, where he rose through the enlisted ranks and received an honorable discharge. “What I know about Tim Walz is he did his job diligently,” said retired Minnesota National Guard Brig. Gen. Jeff Bertrang. “He was in charge of troops under him, and he made sure they were taken care of.” Republicans have seized on criticism by Guard veterans as a major line of attack on Walz and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris. Some of that criticism, like Kolb’s, is measured. Others offer harsher appraisals. It’s far from clear whether Republicans can turn Walz’s military record into a liability. His decades of service stand in contrast with former President Donald Trump, the Republican presidential nominee who received a series of deferments to avoid serving in Vietnam, including one attained with a physician’s letter stating that Trump suffered from bone spurs in his feet. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, was a Marine Corps corporal, including six months as a military journalist in Iraq. After four years, he left the military for college and later a career in venture capital and as a best-selling author. Vance has led the criticism of Walz. For many Democrats, the GOP salvos are an eerie reprise of the tactics used to sully their 2004 presidential candidate, John Kerry, by questioning his leadership as a swift boat commander in Vietnam, even though Kerry was a decorated combat veteran and his Republican opponent, President George W. Bush, did not fight in the war. But the criticism stems not so much from Walz’s service record but from how he has characterized his time in uniform and how he ended his tenure. An Associated Press review of Walz’s statements as a congressional candidate, congressman and governor shows that Walz has toggled between being precise and careless about key details. Walz’s supporters reject the criticism as politically motivated and say it denigrates the sacrifices he and other troops have made. The Harris campaign provided a letter signed by hundreds of veterans and military family members that said Vance’s broadsides against Walz are not surprising given reports that Trump expressed disdain for those who served. Trump has denied the claim. “After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform — and as vice president of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,” the campaign said. In a speech this past week at the Democratic National Convention, Walz said he “proudly wore our nation’s uniform for 24 years.” He made no reference to his rank or the circumstances of his retirement, framing his service as part of a larger urge to “contribute” to the nation. Distinction with a difference “I’m a retired command sergeant major,” Walz said in 2006 as he campaigned to unseat the six-term Republican incumbent in Minnesota’s 1st Congressional District. But that statement was not true. Walz served briefly as a command sergeant major, but that was not the rank he held at retirement. It is not clear whether Walz repeated the exact claim after he won the House race, but he did not object when colleagues put the honorific before his name during House debates to underscore his gravitas on military matters. That distinction -– serving as a command sergeant major, but not retiring in that position -– may seem minor to civilians. But to those in uniform, it is not. Rank is revered in the Army. Known as an E-9 in military parlance, a command sergeant major is the pinnacle of achievement in the Army’s enlisted corps. Command sergeant majors are the backbone of a unit, acting as mentors and disciplinarians to the enlisted troops and trusted advisers to their commanding officers. Sergeant majors often stay in their units for long stretches, providing a deep well of institutional knowledge. Commissioned officers typically move on to new posts every few years. “There’s a reason why there’s so much angst about this among military members that maybe is lost on the rest of the population,” Kolb said. “The rank of command sergeant major, that E-9 rank, is sacred. It’s rare.” Walz was command sergeant major of the Minnesota Guard’s 1st Battalion, 125th Field Artillery for less than a year, according to the Guard’s personnel office. His rank was reduced for benefit purposes to master sergeant, a step below, when he left the Guard because Walz had not completed all the coursework necessary to hold the rank in retirement. Facing questions about Walz’s record, the Harris campaign replaced the phrase “a retired command sergeant major” from Walz’s online biography with wording that says he served as one. But Walz’s official biography on the Minnesota governor’s website is still misleading. That biography places “retired from” a Guard battalion after the phrase “Command Sergeant Major Walz.” “He’s a retired master sergeant,” Kolb said. “And that’s what he should say.” The campaign also acknowledged that Walz misspoke in a 2018 video posted on social media that recorded him saying “weapons of war that I carried in war.” Vance seized on the comment to accuse Walz of lying about being in a combat zone when he never was. Walz and other Guard troops were sent to Italy in 2003 to provide base security in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, the Pentagon’s name for the war in Afghanistan. Questions about Walz mischaracterizing his personal story have not been limited to military service. He is also facing scrutiny for how he has described his family’s struggle with infertility. He has implied that he and his wife used in vitro fertilization to conceive, drawing a connection between their experience and efforts to limit the procedure. But they actually used intrauterine insemination treatments, a different process that has attracted less controversy. Mia Ehrenberg, a campaign spokesperson, defended Walz’s comments and denied that he had been misleading. She said Walz “talks how normal people talk” and was using “commonly understood shorthand for fertility treatments.” Leaving the Guard By military standards, Walz’s 24 years of service is substantial. He could have retired almost three years earlier. But it is the circumstances surrounding the retirement and how it overlapped with his political ambitions that have drawn scrutiny. In January 2005, Walz attended a boot camp of sorts in Minnesota for people interested in careers in progressive politics. Walz, a teacher and avid pheasant hunter with blue-collar roots, stood out as a candidate who might win in the state’s strongly Republican 1st Congressional District. Minnesota Democratic party officials had already begun to take notice of Walz. Mike Erlandson, the party’s state chair at the time, recalled the enthusiasm one of his aides brimmed with after meeting with Walz in Mankato, a town about 70 miles southwest of Minneapolis where Walz taught high school geography. “He came barging into my office at the state party, saying, ‘Mike, this guy Tim is the real deal,’ and was very excited about Tim Walz and the prospect of him running for Congress,” Erlandson said. By February, Walz announced that he was considering a run for Congress. But thousands of miles away, the war in Iraq had entered its third year and hopes for a speedy U.S. withdrawal were evaporating. In mid-March, Walz’s battalion was notified of a possible deployment to Iraq. In a campaign news release, Walz said he would stay in the congressional race “whether I am in Minnesota or Iraq.” He had a responsibility, the release said, to ready his battalion for war “but also to serve if called on.” Less than two months later, on May 16, 2005, Walz retired from the National Guard. His departure was not unusual. More than 730 senior enlisted soldiers with 24 years of service retired in 2005 when the U.S. was heavily engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to Defense Department statistics. But Doug Julin, a Minnesota Guard command sergeant major senior to Walz, told CNN on Aug. 8 that Walz had assured him just weeks before that Walz would be going forward with the battalion. Julin, who did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press, said he was surprised to learn Walz left the Guard without first discussing the decision with him. Kolb picked Tom Behrends, who has emerged as Walz’s most biting critic, to replace Walz as the 1st Battalion’s command sergeant major. The unit received an alert order for mobilization to Iraq in mid-July 2005 and a few months later headed to Mississippi for training. The unit shipped to Iraq in March 2006 where it would spend the next 16 months. Later that year, Walz, unopposed in the Democratic primary, would pull off an upset, beating Republican Rep. Gil Gutknecht. Questions about Walz’s military record had percolated during that campaign. A letter to the editor in the Mankato Free Press newspaper from a person identified as Maj. Walter Gates said information about Walz’s military career strongly suggested that Walz had fought in Iraq or Afghanistan. To which country did Walz “deploy downrange”? Gates asked. Walz responded by saying the letter appeared to be an attempt to “slander my good name.” Walz wrote, incorrectly, that he retired as a command sergeant major, but accurately specified that he served on three NATO training missions and in Italy. Walz was equally clear about his wartime service in a 2009 interview with the Library of Congress’s Veterans History Project. Gates did not respond to multiple messages from the AP so it is unclear what information he was referring to. Walz, in the early 2005 campaign news release, did not mention Italy when he said he deployed for eight months in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, phrasing that could imply he served in Afghanistan. A 2006 congressional campaign ad described Walz as a soldier who had served for two decades and was “ready when they attacked.” Joe Eustice, who took over for Behrends as the 1st Battalion’s top enlisted soldier, said Walz was entitled to leave the Guard when he did. “When you’ve given 24 years of your life, you get to decide, and your reasoning can be whatever you want it to be,” said Eustice, who retired in 2014. But he is troubled by Walz’s statements after he left the Guard. “He should answer to the fact that he said he carried a weapon in war and explain why he’s been saying he’s a retired sergeant major,” Eustice said. “Those two things are not true, and he should know better.” A longtime foe Almost two decades have passed since Behrends hurriedly took Walz’s place as the 1st Battalion’s senior enlisted soldier. Yet time has not eased Behrends anger at his predecessor. As Walz’s political career flourished, Kolb advised Behrends to let go of the resentment. But Behrends could not. Not when he read and heard Walz inaccurately referred to as a retired command sergeant major – and Walz failed to set the record straight. After yet another local newspaper elevated Walz’s retirement rank, Behrends wrote to the then-congressman. “It saddens me that after your long career in the National Guard, that you did not fulfill the conditions of your promotion to command sergeant major,” he told Walz. “I would hope that you haven’t been using the rank for political gain, but that is how it appears.” Behrends said he did not get a reply. When Walz ran for governor two years later, Behrends went public with much stronger criticism. A self-described “down-home country boy,” Behrends did not like Walz personally. They are at opposite ends of the political spectrum. Behrends is a conservative who donated $250 to Trump’s 2020 presidential campaign and supported Walz’s Republican opponents in Minnesota. While they were both still in uniform, Behrends grew weary of what he said were Walz’s frequent monologues that at times veered into hot-button issues like abortion. “It was like listening to a long-winded preacher,” he said. In an interview, Behrends said his personal distaste for Walz and his liberal politics played no role in his decision to openly denigrate the vice presidential nominee. Behrends said he would have done the same to a friend if he believed that friend had stepped out of line.

Among the RNC’s efforts that have been successful is the recent Supreme Court decision on Thursday, which reinstated an Arizona law requiring people registering to vote to provide documentary proof of citizenship. “This is a huge win,” Trump said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. “Look, when a federal election is underway, you can only have American citizens voting in that election. Should go without saying, but there are some states that try to push back on that. We took it to the Supreme Court because Democrats in the state of Arizona were attempting to let people register to vote without ID. We said, ‘You need to be able to determine whether or not these are U.S. citizens before they register to vote.’ The Supreme Court agreed with that, and the great news is that it sets precedent across the country so other states can take this and utilize it as well.” Trump also detailed a lawsuit the RNC is filing in Michigan, which is related to the hiring of poll workers in Wayne County. Of the 700 trained Republican poll workers who applied to work, only 50 were hired compared to the 2,300 Democratic poll workers who were hired. The RNC co-chairwoman then issued a warning to anyone “who is attempting to cheat in our elections,” saying that the RNC will “track you down and will prosecute you to the full extent of the law.” “We’re watching everything, we’re filing lawsuits when necessary, and we’re making sure we have people everywhere votes are being cast and counted to have eyes on everything,” Trump said.

And now that she’s the Democratic nominee, Harris has switched to insisting she’ll fix everything, though the details remain beyond sketchy and she has yet to announce a single break from the Biden policies of the last 3½ years. And last week brought news that, in at least one key area, the public was right and the stats were wrong: The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its count of jobs added from April 2023 to March 2024 down by 818,000 — the largest downward revision since 2009. That brought the total estimate of job gains over those 12 months from 2.9 million to 2.1 million, nearly 30%. And when a reporter asked Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo about the grim news, she answered with the nuance characteristic of the Democrats who’ve presided over so much economic pain: “I don’t believe it” because the reporter had asked for her to respond to a clip of Donald Trump citing the stats. That is: One of the top Dems when it comes to economic policy didn’t know about a major piece of economic news, and fell back on Orange Man Bad. No wonder the Biden-Harris economy stinks. Of course, the public has many reasons to see the economy differently that the statistics the Democrats’ cheerleaders cite: Add in, for example, the fact the employment growth Biden-Harris actually produce is largely jobs in government or in federally-funded health care. People know, too that prices for groceries, gas and other basic goods have soared in the Biden-Harris years, while credit-card debt has hit record highs. Three in five Americans say they believe the United States is in a recession. Democrats and their press cheerleaders have dropped the “don’t believe your lying eyes (or bank accounts)” line of defense. Instead, they’re trying to memory-hole the entire Biden presidency, as if switching out Joe for Kamala — but offering the exact same economic approach — will somehow produce better results. Seriously: Accepting the nomination last Thursday, Harris vowed she would “grow our economy ” and “lower the cost of everyday needs like health care and housing and groceries. What’s her plan to do this? Another $1.7 trillion in new spending plus $5 trillion in new taxes. The only new policies she’s announced are copying the Trump “no tax on tips” idea and the JD Vance “boost the child tax credit” proposal. Oh, and a flirtation with Sen. Liz Warren’s price-controls agenda, though (once even liberal press slammed the idea) her aides “clarified” that Harris didn’t really mean much by that. Joe Biden’s economic policies were Democratic Party orthodoxy, and a President Harris’ would be, too, even if she imposes them with more “joy.” Average Americans know they and their neighbors prospered in the Trump years but got slammed after the Democrats took over.

Tim Walz is facing another accusation of misrepresenting his background after a Nebraska Chamber of Commerce letter from 2006 resurfaced amid Walz’s campaign for vice president. When Walz first ran for Congress in Minnesota, he touted on his campaign website that he received an award from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce in 1993 for his work with the business community, according to a 2006 article from the Post Bulletin. He never received such an award, however, which was outlined to him in a blistering letter from the then-president of the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce, Barry L. Kennedy. “We researched this matter and can confirm that you have not been the recipient of any award from the Nebraska Chamber of Commerce,” the letter addressed to Walz on Nov. 1, 2006, reads. “I am not going to draw a conclusion about your intentions by including this line in your biography. However, we respectfully request that you remove any reference to our organization as it could be considered an endorsement of your candidacy. It should be pointed out, however, that the US Chamber of Commerce has endorsed your opponent, Congressman Gil Gutknecht, for his support of small business issues,” Kennedy continued. The letter was unearthed by Minnesota outlet Alpha News last week, after the controversy gained traction locally in 2006. The Post Bulletin, a Minnesota newspaper based in Rochester, reported in 2006 that Walz’s congressional campaign updated its website to reflect Walz did not win a Nebraska Chamber of Commerce award, but had won an award from the Nebraska Junior Chamber of Commerce, known as the Jaycees. The then-campaign manager passed off the issue as a “typographical error,” the outlet reported at the time. When approached by Fox Digital about the 2006 controversy, the Harris-Walz campaign said Walz frequently speaks “openly and off the cuff.” “Governor Walz speaks the way real people speak – openly and off the cuff. The American people appreciate that Gov. Walz tells it like it is and doesn’t talk like a politician, and they appreciate the difference between someone who occasionally misspeaks and a pathological liar like Donald Trump,” the campaign said. The claim follows a long history of people accusing Walz of misrepresenting himself and his history, most notably a bevy of veterans accusing the Gopher State Democrat of misrepresenting his military career. Walz served 24 years in the Army National Guard before retiring in 2005, when he launched a successful congressional campaign and served as a member of the US House representing Minnesota from 2007 until 2019. Following Vice President Kamala Harris naming him as her running mate, Walz has been slammed by a number of veterans for allegedly misrepresenting his service in the military, including identifying himself to the public as a retired “Command Sergeant Major.” Here is the latest on VP pick Tim Walz’s time in the military National Guard vet claims Walz went above him to secure retirement: ‘He knew I would have told him, “Suck it up”’ Tim Walz falsely claimed he carried weapons ‘in war’ in resurfaced clip: ‘Absolutely false’ Tim Walz left National Guard battalion ‘hanging,’ ‘slithered out the door’ before Iraq deployment: vets Tim Walz a ‘coward’ and ‘traitor’ for retiring from military before Iraq, says Guardsman who replaced VP pick Walz was promoted to the command sergeant major rank following a deployment to Italy in 2004, but he did not complete coursework with the US Army Sergeants Major Academy to retain the rank in retirement. Walz instead retired as a master sergeant, one pay grade below command sergeant major. “For 20 years, they let this guy go by with a lie that he deployed to Iraq, which he didn’t, and that he retired as a command sergeant major, which he did not. I mean, that’s just blatant lies,” Republican Virginia Senate candidate Hung Cao, a retired Navy captain, told The New York Post this month of Walz. The battalion commander of Walz’s former Minnesota Army National Guard unit also issued a scathing message to Harris’ running mate earlier this month regarding him portraying himself as a “retired Command Sergeant Major.”","summary":"Minnesota Gov.

Kennedy Human Rights nonprofit organization that was founded in honor of her father, spoke with MSNBC's Jen Psaki, a former White House press secretary under President Joe Biden, in an interview appearance, two days after her brother dropped out of the race and endorsed the former president.Prior to exiting the race on Friday, Kennedy Jr. was the highest polling third-party candidate in the campaign, garnering around 5 percent of the vote, according to national aggregate polls.During her interview on Inside with Jen Psaki, Kerry Kennedy said that Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are \"champions for the values that my family has fought for years. Donald Trump is the polar opposite. He's a threat to most basic freedoms.\"Steven Cheung, Trump's campaign spokesperson, told Newsweek in an email Sunday morning in response to Max Kennedy's Los Angeles Times opinion article that expressed similar sentiments to Kerry Kennedy: \"President Trump is working to Save America from Comrade Kamala, and everyone should get on board. That's why so many people from different political backgrounds have supported President Trump.\"Newsweek reached out to Trump's campaign for updated comment via email on Sunday afternoon.Like many of her other family members, Kerry Kennedy denounced her brother's endorsement of Trump, saying she is \"outraged and disgusted\" by it. Five family members, including Kerry, posted a statement on Friday calling their brother's endorsement a \"betrayal\" of their family values.Kerry Kennedy initially endorsed Biden, but after his exit from the race on July 21, she shifted her support to Harris.She, like her brother Max Kennedy in his opinion piece published earlier today, referenced their father, Robert F. Kennedy—the late Democratic politician and human rights advocate—and his legacy in their condemnation of their brother's endorsement.\"If my dad were alive today, the real Robert Kennedy would have detested almost everything Donald Trump represents,\" she told Psaki. She previously said similar comments on CNN yesterday.The segment concluded with Kerry Kennedy saying, \"I completely disavow and disassociate myself from Robert Kennedy Jr. and his flagrant and inexplicable effort to desecrate and trample and set fire to my father's memory.\"Newsweek also reached out to Kennedy Jr.'s campaign for comment on Sunday.Meghan McCain, a political commentator and daughter of the late Republican Senator John McCain, reshared Kerry Kennedy's statement on X on Saturday and wrote: \"I don't support Trump and will not be supporting Trump but this family drama playing out so publicly is really quite trashy and beneath all of you for a family who considers itself the premier American political dynasty (despite being almost a century removed from power).\"","summary":"A video of Kerry Kennedy criticizing her brother's endorsement of GOP nominee Donald Trump has been widely viewed on social media on Sunday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/video-rfk-jr-sister-kerry-kennedy-condeming-trump-endorsement-takes-off-online-1944180","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457669/kerry-kennedy.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 22:01:39","author":"Mandy Taheri","authors":["Mandy Taheri"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":0.08},{"id":254906510,"title":"Harris campaign says it’s raised $540 million and saw a surge of donations during the convention","text":"(AP) — Vice President Kamala Harris’ campaign says it has now raised $540 million for its election battle against Republican nominee former President Donald Trump. The campaign has had no problems getting supporters to open their wallets since President Joe Biden announced on July 21 he was ending his campaign and quickly endorsed Harris. The campaign said it saw a surge of donations during last week’s Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris and her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, accepted their nominations. “Just before Vice President Harris’ acceptance speech Thursday night, we officially crossed the $500 million mark,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon wrote in a memo released by the campaign on Sunday. “Immediately after her speech, we saw our best fundraising hour since launch day.” Trump has also proven to be a formidable fundraiser, but appears to be outpaced in her month-old campaign. Trump’s campaign and its related affiliates announced earlier this month that they had raised $138.7 million in July — less than what Harris took in during her White House bid’s opening week. Trump’s campaign reported $327 million in cash on hand at the start of August. The Harris fundraising totals were raised by Harris for President, the Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees. O’Malley Dillon said that nearly a third of contributions during convention week came from first-time contributors. About one-fifth of those first-time contributors were young voters and two-thirds were women, groups that the campaign sees as critical constituencies that Harris needs to turn out to win in November. The Harris campaign says it has also seen a surge in volunteer support for the vice president. During convention week, supporters signed up for nearly 200,000 volunteer shifts to help the campaign.

He argued this comes down to a few reasons, such as Harris’s lack of policy discussion and current polling having her further behind Trump than former presidential candidates Hillary Clinton in 2016 and Biden in 2020. “And then, No. 3, Kamala Harris cannot run from Joe Biden,” Donalds said on Fox News’s Sunday Morning Futures with Maria Bartiromo. “I know she’s trying to run as a prosecutor, but her current title is vice president of the United States, and she was riding shotgun with Joe Biden, creating one of the worst economies for working families and middle-class families in the history of our country while leaving our southern border wide open to more than 10 million illegal immigrants. I believe that Donald Trump is well positioned to win this race.” Donalds also contended that the Democratic Party has been in charge for 12 of the last 16 years, and the only time people were better off was when Trump was president. He backed up his statement by arguing the economy was “flourishing” and that there were no new wars under Trump’s leadership. When asked if he believes Trump can convince swing voters to support him over Harris, Donalds said he does, but that Trump needs to show the contrast between his policies and Harris’s. He also cautioned that wealthy people in the country will not be affected by Harris’s policies should she become president, and those who would be financially hurt would be working families and senior residents on fixed incomes. Earlier this month, Donalds encouraged the former president to campaign against Harris’s “soft on crime” record, saying “she was bailing out rioters during the summer of love with the Black Lives Matter riots in Minneapolis.” He also suggested that Trump conduct events with victims, referencing how some of these victims were at the Republican National Convention and spoke about “the failures” of Biden and Harris.

The former president listed more than a dozen incidents of children and women being sexually assaulted or killed by illegal immigrants, including the deaths of 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray of Texas and 37-year-old Rachel Morin of Maryland. Polling data indicate Trump currently has a slim lead over Harris in Pennsylvania, a state largely coveted within the Electoral College.

The South Carolina senator is one of Trump’s continued allies in the Senate, though he has been subject to boos at Trump’s rallies and the occasional put-down from Magaworld. On Sunday, he was interviewed by Jake Tapper on CNN and asked about a comment Trump had made on Truth Social following his live response to Kamala Harris’s primetime speech last week at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Posting on Truth Social, Trump made several dozen short remarks during Harris’s speech — which ended up being quite a bit shorter than his own 92-minute address to July’s Republican National Convention. In one post the next morning, he would then go on to claim that his administration “will be great for women and their reproductive rights”. Graham was asked by Tapper how the former president’s second term in the White House would fit that description: “I don’t know, you’d have to ask him,” he demurred. He then did what Trump campaign officials likely wished he would not have, and segued into an argument in favor of a national abortion ban for so-called “late-term” abortions. Trump has said repeatedly that he does not support a national ban on abortion even as he has taken credit for the end of federal protections; Democrats argue he is lying. The latter half of Trump’s claim from Truth Social, at a minimum, is questionable. The ex-president has repeatedly taken credit for the nationwide rollback of federal abortion protections which occurred in 2022 when a conservative Supreme Court majority including three justices appointed by Trump overturned Roe v Wade. That decision has led to a wave of state-led efforts to restrict abortion, some of which have caused cases of pregnant women being denied critical care in hospitals fearful of running afoul of the law. Trump and his wing of the GOP have attempted a delicate dance around the issue even as Trump himself has grown increasingly confident about signaling his role in Roe’s downfall. The party, at his campaign’s behest, scrubbed support for a national abortion banfrom their platform earlier this year. Graham himself famously declared Trump persona non grata in the Republican Party in the immediate wake of the January 6 siege on Congress, committed by the ex-president’s supporters and aimed at blocking lawmakers from certifying the 2020 election. But Graham and many other Republicans came back around and rejoined Magaworld, even at the expense of having to face uncomfortable questions about that day. That happened to Graham on Sunday as Tapper also questioned him about the ongoing lionization of January 6 rioters by the Republican base, pointing to a “January 6 awards gala” set to be held by some right-wing Maga groups. Former President Donald Trump has said on the campaign trail that he supports pardons and official apologies for some Americans charged and convicted in the January 6 attack, despite dozens of police officers being battered and injured during the assault. The South Carolina senator argued that any rioter convicted of attacking a police officer should go to jail, though he appeared to leave room for others to be let off. “The people who broke into the Capitol and assaulted police officers should go to jail. They committed a crime,” said Graham, while adding that “both parties” needed to “knock off” the normalization of political violence.","summary":"Trump issued Truth Social tirade amid Kamala Harris’s DNC primetime speech","url":"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/graham-cnn-trump-dnc-kamala-b2601713.html","image":"https://static.independent.co.uk/2024/04/29/14/SEI201150922.jpg?width=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/MG5T12Xm-4VHSaSK0.mp4","publish_date":"2024-08-25 21:41:48","author":"John Bowden","authors":["John Bowden"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"gb","sentiment":-0.305},{"id":254906498,"title":"\"American women are not stupid\": Warren isn't buying that Trump would veto a federal abortion ban","text":"During his appearance on \"Meet the Press\" on Sunday, JD Vance told host Kristen Welker that Donald Trump has “explicitly” said that he would veto a federal abortion ban if a bill were to be passed by Congress. “I can absolutely commit that,” Vance said. “Donald Trump’s view is that we want the individual states and their individual cultures and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions because we don’t want to have a nonstop federal conflict over this issue.” And to this, Elizabeth Warren is calling BS. In a \"Meet the Press\" interview of her own, Warren pointed back to Trump and Vance's previous comments and actions to the contrary, saying, “American women are not stupid, and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion for women all across this country.\" After Welker pointed out that it seemed Warren wasn't buying Trump and Vance's spin on this, she stomped down even harder, saying, “Don’t buy it? Just read it. JD Vance actually sent a letter last year to the Department of Justice to enforce the Comstock Act. And remember he did that, and then Donald Trump picked him to be his vice president. The only way that we’re going to protect access to abortion is to have a Democratic Congress send a bill to Kamala Harris.

The campaign has had no problems getting supporters to open their wallets since President Joe Biden announced on July 21 he was ending his campaign and quickly endorsed Harris. The campaign said it saw a surge of donations during last week's Democratic National Convention in Chicago where Harris and her vice presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, accepted their nominations. “Just before Vice President Harris’ acceptance speech Thursday night, we officially crossed the $500 million mark,\" campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon wrote in a memo released by the campaign on Sunday. \"Immediately after her speech, we saw our best fundraising hour since launch day.” Trump has also proven to be a formidable fundraiser, but appears to be outpaced in her month-old campaign. Trump's campaign and its related affiliates announced earlier this month that they had raised $138.7 million in July — less than what Harris took in during her White House bid’s opening week. Trump’s campaign reported $327 million in cash on hand at the start of August. The Harris fundraising totals were raised by Harris for President, the Democratic National Committee, and joint fundraising committees. O'Malley Dillon said that nearly a third of contributions during convention week came from first-time contributors. About one-fifth of those first-time contributors were young voters and two-thirds were women, groups that the campaign sees as critical constituencies that Harris needs to turn out to win in November. The Harris campaign says it has also seen a surge in volunteer support for the vice president. During convention week, supporters signed up for nearly 200,000 volunteer shifts to help the campaign. © Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Email tips@dailymail.co.uk By Grant Tucker Entertainment Editor Published:22:29 BST, 25 August 2024 |Updated:22:37 BST, 25 August 2024 e-mail View comments BBC bosses have slashed Strictly’s budget for the upcoming 20th series amid a series of scandals which could lead to payouts for former stars. The casting budget on the flagship show was cut in the wake of the Strictly bullying scandal, according to Corporation sources. Instead funding has been diverted to increased welfare measures on the dance show. There are concerns among bosses of further financial strain as former stars line up to make claims for being mistreated during their time on the show. The current scandal has seen numerous allegations of misbehaviour and forced professional dancers Graziano Di Prima and Giovanni Pernice to exit the long-running Saturday night programme. BBC bosses have slashed Strictly ’s budget for the upcoming 20th series amid a series of scandals which could lead to payouts for former stars The current scandal has seen numerous allegations of misbehaviour and forced professional dancers Graziano Di Prima and Giovanni Pernice (pictured) to exit the long-running show Read More Sacked Strictly star Graziano Di Prima 'wants to sue BBC' and has 'already hired top lawyers' A source said: ‘Money had to be found to pay for chaperones and welfare producers, and we still don’t know how much all these allegations are going to cost the show. It is not going to be cheap. A decision was made to make cuts to the cast.’ The reduced casting budget was noticeable with scores of Strictly fans underwhelmed when this year’s celebrity lineup was unveiled earlier this month. Audiences were left scratching their heads as they struggled to recognise little-known TV doctor Punam Krishnan and former Love Island contestant Tasha Ghouri. The source said that the only contestants on big money among this year’s cast are DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles and football pundit Paul Merson. They added: ‘The line-up is one of our cheapest ever. We know audiences are disappointed, especially given the quality of our celebrities in the last five years.’ It is a further blow for Strictly bosses who had high hopes for the 20th anniversary series, which launches on September 14. Working on the latest series will be a team of new production staff to chaperone the celebrity stars. They will be present in rehearsal room training at all times to monitor any signs of inappropriate behaviour. BBC bosses were forced to take ‘decisive steps’ to improve the show’s protection for celebrities after allegations of abuse were made by contestants including actress Amanda Abbington and former reality TV star Zara McDermott. BBC bosses were forced to take ‘decisive steps’ to improve the show’s protection for celebrities after allegations of abuse were made by contestants including actress Amanda Abbington and former reality TV star Zara McDermott (pictured) Pernice, Strictly’s longest-serving male pro, was accused of bullying by Abbington in rehearsals last year and a BBC investigation is still ongoing. The 33-year-old Sicilian has strongly denied any wrongdoing. The Mail on Sunday yesterday revealed Pernice was to be exonerated after Abbington’s accusations. BBC insiders told the newspaper there was no evidence that Pernice had bullied her. But the actress is said to be so determined to win her case that she is having what friends of Pernice describe as ‘one last throw of the dice’ by telling the BBC about a short video clip he sent to her on WhatsApp. Sources within the Corporation say it is ‘sex-related’ but in its nature was ‘very much banter’. A source said: ‘This is literally the last thing that Amanda has got, so, of course, she will be hoping that it sticks. It’s the only thing that is in any way tangible against Giovanni.’ The report’s findings are not expected until next month.

Biden appointees like Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, and Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter have broadened the scope of government antitrust oversight to consider issues such as a deal's impact on workers and on potential new market entrants. Dealmakers have complained of added costs from this heightened scrutiny, while Khan and Kanter insist they have deterred problematic deals. But with the clock ticking on Biden's tenure, the antitrust and dealmaking universes have begun to ponder what comes next as voters weigh the candidacies of Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump. While a Trump win is broadly expected to result in less antitrust enforcement and more dealmaking than a Harris victory, even that outcome is not certain, as today's Republican coalition includes not just corporate interests but figures like Trump's running mate Senator JD Vance, who has praised Khan. \"There is a lot of uncertainty there,\" said New York University Professor Harry First. He said the populist tilt of some members of Trump's coalition \"makes it hard to predict what will happen.\" A Trump election win would be \"slightly positive to very positive\" for dealmaking, predicted a Wall Street banker, who spoke on condition that he not be identified. He cautioned that optimism over a potential shift under Trump should be tempered by worries over a renewed U.S.-China trade war. Biden set an adversarial tone toward dealmaking early in his presidency, saying that too many big companies were \"consuming their competitors.\" An executive order he signed in July 2021 promoted competition and included tougher antitrust enforcement. Biden cast the approach as a needed pivot from a failed 40-year \"experiment of letting giant corporations accumulate more and more power.\" The appointment of Khan sent a clear message to the business world, including tech behemoths. Khan shot to prominence following a 2017 academic article on Amazon that criticized antitrust enforcement for overlooking key priorities such as a deal's impact on workers and the potential for big companies -- not yet monopolies -- to discourage new competitors from emerging. Khan and Kanter have signaled the importance of these issues, including in merger guidelines finalized in December 2023. They have scored some litigation wins, including the unwinding of Illumina's acquisition of Grail in a case involving cancer detection tests; and a ruling this month that Google's search engine constituted a monopoly in a case originally brought by the Trump administration. But the Biden administration has also suffered some major setbacks, losing a challenge to Microsoft's takeover of Activision Blizzard and to UnitedHealth Group's acquisition of Change Healthcare. Former FTC enforcement official Ryan Quillian has pointed to data that the current commission actually has filed fewer lawsuits than its predecessors. He argued in an October 2023 paper that the Biden administration's \"rhetoric outpaces\" its enforcement numbers. Quillian, now a partner with Covington & Burling, said the agencies were focused on \"rhetoric and process to deter\" merger activity. CEOs considering transactions now weigh the chance of antitrust enforcement \"at the beginning of a deal,\" said the Wall Street banker, adding that \"there is no question that clients think two or three times more about deals that are on the line.\" The American Investment Council, a trade group for the private equity industry, has sharply criticized a Biden administration proposal to significantly increase pre-merger notification disclosures. The proposed changes to the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act would include details about the rationale of a transaction, projected revenue streams and corporate relationships. The proposed rule \"will make it far more costly to consummate such deals,\" slowing the American economy \"to the detriment of the very consumers whom the antitrust laws are intended to benefit,\" the council said in September 2023 comments. Those changes have yet to be finalized. The next administration will need to decide whether to uphold this policy, along with the 2023 merger guidelines, which would need to be adopted by U.S. courts to have teeth. Other questions concern pending lawsuits against tech giants Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook parent Meta, and whether to proceed with litigation or take another route, such as settlement or dismissal. © 2024 AFP","summary":"President Joe Biden's skeptical approach to corporate mergers has been a hallmark of his administration's business policy -- a stance generally expected to ease if Donald Trump returns…","url":"https://japantoday.com/category/business/dealmakers-ponder-what%27s-next-after-tough-biden-antitrust-years","image":"https://japantoday-asset.scdn3.secure.raxcdn.com/img/store/c2/25/9d5868fe41135041d81c24c41850c82b6e42/c2259d5868fe41135041d81c24c41850c82b6e42/_w1700.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 21:36:10","author":"Japan Today Editor,John Biers","authors":["Japan Today Editor","John Biers"],"language":"en","source_country":"jp","sentiment":-0.023},{"id":254902932,"title":"Trump's 'October Surprise' May Include RFK Jr.—Political Analyst","text":"Political analyst Jennifer Rubin predicted on Saturday that former President Donald Trump's \"October surprise\" may include former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr.On Friday, Kennedy Jr., an environmental lawyer, dropped out of this year's presidential race and endorsed Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, instead of Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. Later that night, Kennedy Jr. joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally in Glendale, Arizona. When introducing him, Trump called Kennedy Jr. \"a man who has been an incredible champion for so many of these values that we all share.\"There is speculation among some that Trump could offer Kennedy Jr. a role in his administration in exchange for his support.In an interview appearance on MSNBC's The Saturday Show with Jonathan Capehart, Rubin, a former conservative political commentator throughout most of her career and became a vocal critic of Trump in September 2020, spoke about Kennedy Jr.'s endorsement.When asked by Capehart what kind of impact Kennedy Jr. has on the now two-way race, Rubin noted how he is a \"perfect match\" for Trump as she predicted that Trump's running mate Ohio Senator JD Vance should \"stick by the phone\" because Trump may pull in Kennedy Jr. as \"an October surprise.\"\"The more people know about Bobby Kennedy, the more people who are saying they do not want to vote for him. I think he's a perfect match for Donald Trump,\" Rubin said before making a prediction. \"If I were JD Vance, I would stick by the phone because he might be just the kind of guy that Trump would pull in as an October surprise. He is a nut, he is a conspiracy nut, he's a racist, he has come up with all of these cockamamie theories of prosecutions. In that sense, he's very much a Trump rather than a Kennedy.\"An \"October surprise\" refers to an event or late revelation that can change the trajectory of a presidential election as it can cause irreparable damage to one candidate's chances and boost the other's.Newsweek has reached out to Vance's campaign spokesperson via email for comment.Kennedy Jr., the son of 1968 Democratic presidential candidate Senator Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of Democratic President John F. Kennedy, has gained attention in recent years for his skepticism toward the COVID-19 vaccinations. He also stirred controversy on several occasions while on the campaign trail. Earlier this month, Kennedy admitted to dumping a dead bear cub in Central Park in Manhattan 10 years earlier, saying that he and his friends who assisted thought the act was \"amusing.\"In response to Rubin's remarks, Trump's communications director, Steven Cheung condemned her in an emailed statement to Newsweek on Sunday.\"Jennifer Rubin is a washed-up loser who suffers from Trump Derangement Syndrome that has rotted her brain. The Never Trump movement is on its death bed, and they are doing everything they can to stay relevant, including making up outright lies and falsehoods to convince themselves of their delusional reality,\" he said.While it's unclear how Kennedy Jr.'s decision to suspend his campaign will impact an already tight race, Rubin's prediction comes after Vance has had a difficult time in the polls since Trump announced he was his running mate at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July.His early polling issues seem to be changing in some polls, with the most recent Morning Consult research showing that voters are now only 2 points more likely to have unfavorable than favorable views of Vance.The polling aggregation site FiveThirtyEight shows unfavorable opinions of Vance at 43.2 percent and favorable opinions of him at 33.2 percent. This is a net difference of 10 percentage points, the first time it has been in the double digits on FiveThirtyEight since Vance entered the race.FiveThirtyEight's results, the most recent of which were updated on Wednesday, are based on a projection of 95 percent of polls falling in that range.Despite any concerns over Vance's polling numbers, Trump's campaign and even Trump himself have remained firm on their decision of Vance as their vice president pick.Trump spokesperson, Cheung, denied reports that Trump was regretting picking Vance as his running mate in a statement to Newsweek last month.\"President Trump is thrilled with the choice he made with Senator Vance, and they are the perfect team to take back the White House. And any reporting to the contrary is nothing but ridiculous fake news from either nonexistent sources or individuals who have no idea what's going on,\" he said.","summary":"\"If I were JD Vance, I would stick by the phone,\" Jennifer Rubin said on Saturday.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/trumps-october-surprise-may-include-rfk-jr-jennifer-rubin-1944169","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457655/donald-trump-robert-f-kennedy-jr.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 21:34:37","author":"Natalie Venegas","authors":["Natalie Venegas"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.04},{"id":254903484,"title":"Trump would veto legislation establishing a federal abortion ban, Vance says","text":"NEW YORK (AP) — Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance says Donald Trump would not support a national abortion ban if elected president and would veto such legislation if it landed on his desk. “I can absolutely commit that,” Vance said when asked on NBC’s “Meet the Press” whether he could commit to Trump not imposing such a ban. “Donald Trump’s view is that we want the individual states and their individual cultures and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions because we don’t want to have a nonstop federal conflict over this issue.” The Ohio senator also insisted that Trump, the former president who is the Republican nominee this year, would veto such legislation if it were passed by Congress. “I mean, if you’re not supporting it as the president of the United States, you fundamentally have to veto it,” he said in an interview that aired Sunday. Vance’s comments come after Democrats spent night after night of their national convention in Chicago last week assailing Trump for his role in appointing the Supreme Court Justices who overturned Roe v. Wade, ending the constitutional right to abortion in the United States and paving the way for bans and restrictions across Republican-led states. But efforts to try to neutralize an issue that Democrats hope will galvanize voters this fall also risk alienating parts of Trump’s base opposed to abortion rights. “God have mercy on this nation if this is now the position of what was the Pro-Life Party,” wrote Family Research Council president Tony Perkins in a post Sunday linking to a story on Vance’s comments. While Trump has repeatedly boasted about his role in overturning Roe, he has, in recent days, pushed back on Democrats’ warnings that he will go even further to restrict access if he wins a second term. “My Administration will be great for women and their reproductive rights,” he wrote Friday on his Truth Social platform, appropriating language used by abortion rights activists and the left. His comments drew a wave of criticism from anti-abortion advocates, including the editor of the conservative National Review, which published an article titled “Trump’s Abandonment of Pro-Lifers Is Complete.” Trump repeated his claim hours later at an event in Las Vegas. “I’m very strong on women’s reproductive rights. The IVF (in vitro fertilization), very strong. I mean, we’re leaders in it. And I think people are seeing that,” he told reporters. Democrats have responded to Trump with deep skepticism. “American women are not stupid and we are not going to trust the futures of our daughters and granddaughters to two men who have openly bragged about blocking access to abortion for women all across this country,” said Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren told NBC. Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., brushed off a question asking how Trump would be “great’ on reproductive rights. “You need to ask him about that. What I would say is that President Trump was a very good pro-life president,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “The pro-life community,” Graham said,, “is organized around the well-being of the child, giving the mother options other than an abortion.” Graham said “that movement will continue after he’s gone.” Trump has often struggled to talk about abortion. Before he entered politics, he had described himself as “very pro-choice.” Earlier this year, he grappled with his stance on a federal abortion ban, suggesting at one point that he would support one at around 15 weeks of pregnancy, with exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when the life of the mother is at risk. He then settled on his current position: That restrictions should be left to individual states. Trump has not said how he plans to vote on an upcoming ballot measure on Florida’s six-week ban. In an interview with CBS News earlier in the week, Trump said he had “no regrets” about his role in overturning Roe v. Wade. But after months of confusing statements, he said he would not use a federal law known as the Comstock Act to try to ban the distribution of medication that is used as an alternative to surgical abortions. That is something that some of his allies have urged and that Vance supported in the past. “We will be discussing specifics of it, but generally speaking, no,” he said. “I would not do that.” “It’s going to be available and it is now. And as I know it, the Supreme Court has said: ‘Keep it going the way it is.’ I will enforce and agree with the Supreme Court, but basically they’ve said, keep it the way it is now,” he said. Abortion has been a powerful motivator for Democrats since the Roe decision in the summer of 2022, and the party expects it to continue to play a key role this year. On stage at the Democratic convention, women told harrowing personal stories of having to carry unviable pregnancies to term and being denied miscarriage care, putting their future fertility at risk. “This is what’s happening in our country because of Donald Trump. And understand, he is not done,” Vice President Kamala Harris said in her speech accepting her party’s nomination. Trump, who had been responding to the speech in real time, falsely insisted that, “Everybody, Democrats, Republicans, Liberals, and Conservatives, wanted Roe v. Wade TERMINATED, and brought back to the States.” “I do not limit access to birth control or I.V.F. – THAT IS A LIE, these are all false stories that she’s making up,” he wrote. “I TRUST WOMEN, ALSO, AND I WILL KEEP WOMEN SAFE!” Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the Republican nominee is planning to ramp up his aggressive campaign to pour cold water on Harris’ sustained momentum. He previewed the attacks he’ll likely go with on these topics during Harris’ speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC), during which he commented live over on Truth Social. ‘Kamala’s biography won’t lower prices at the grocery store, or at the pump!’ he wrote, referencing her stories about her immigrant mother and her work as a prosecutor. ‘She said, “chart a new way forward,” but she’s had three and a half years, and has done nothing but HARM!’ In all caps, he also threw her record as the ‘border czar’ in her face, something Democrats have been trying to protect her from ever since it became clear she’d be the candidate instead of Joe Biden. Biden dropping out of the race seems to have shocked what was a sluggish campaign trail for both candidates. The race has become what Americans typically expect this deep into presidential election years: daily rallies and constant media appearances. Trump advisers say he will be much more active on the stump going forward, the WSJ reported. He is set address a National Guard conference in Detroit on Monday. He’ll be in Michigan and Wisconsin all day Thursday and holding events. Then, to cap off upcoming week, he’ll fly over to Pennsylvania for a rally. Against Trump’s instincts, advisers have set up smaller events for him so he can focus on the issues at hand and actively appeal to undecided voters and independents rather than the roaring MAGA fans who go to rallies and are already with him. On Thursday, for instance, he held a more muted event in front of the border wall in Cochise County, Arizona, where he said Biden and Harris squandered taxpayer money by letting materials for wall construction go to waste. At the event, he invited relatives of Americans killed by illegal immigrants and allowed them to tell their devastating stories that also professed their support for him and the dangers of Harris’ border policy. ‘We will seal the border, stop the invasion, and launch the largest deportation effort in American history,’ Trump said after the families spoke. Trump is also bringing back his campaign manager from his first run in 2016, Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski will reportedly act as another sounding board for Trump, while also making loads of TV appearances himself in the coming weeks. Taylor Budowich is another key, if lesser known, ally jumping on board. He joins the campaign after running the MAGA PAC, a pro-Trump super PAC, and is said to have a strong rapport with Trump. Insiders say he’s good at giving advice, expecting his counsel to be crucial in keeping Trump on message. That’s especially important now that Biden is out of the race. Out of habit, Trump continued attacking the current president well after he dropped out, but now he’s looking for attack lines that work well against Harris specifically. One retort that he seems to have settled on is that the vice president is stealing his policies. Trump vowed to abolish the tax on tips for service workers during a June 9 rally in Las Vegas, even pitching the idea to congressional Republicans days later. Harris made the same promise two weeks ago, prompting many on the right to call her out for jacking one of Trump’s popular olive branches to the working class. Trump had a repeat rally Friday in Las Vegas, where this idea could really appeal to casino workers in Nevada who rely on tips to make a living. ‘She’s a copycat,’ Trump said on stage. Beyond new attacks and smaller, more issue-focused events, Trump and his surrogates plan to make inroads with voters through more nontraditional avenues. This means expect Trump to do things similar to his interview with Elon Musk on X or his podcast sit-down with comedian Theo Von last week. This strategy, campaign officials are saying, is geared toward getting through to more undecided voters – mainly younger men – who are often likelier to listen to alternative media sources. The crème de le crème of the podcast world would obviously be Joe Rogan, who said in 2022 he turned down multiple requests from Trump to appear on his Spotify-hosted program. Trump has never publicly responded to this claim but did attack Rogan this month for saying positive things about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has since dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. The Trump campaign also wants to book surrogates on podcasts geared more toward black male audiences, such as ‘Earn Your Leisure,’ ‘Market Mondays and others, the WSJ reported. Trump and his allies have reportedly shown frustration about the upward trajectory of the Harris campaign but expect this momentum to level off. Most polling aggregators have Harris up nationally by 1.5 to 3.6 points, which is well within the margin of error for most individual polls. At a North Carolina event on Wednesday billed as an address on national security issues, Trump outsourced his campaign strategizing to his own supporters. While lamenting over how former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle levied ‘very nasty’ attacks at him during the DNC, he asked rallygoers whether he should use personal attacks or not. The crowd overwhelmingly indicated that he should. ‘My advisers are fired,’ Trump joked. ‘I would rather keep it on policy. Sometimes it’s hard when you’re attacked on all ends.’","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nDonald Trump&#8217;s Presidential campaign is set to focus on the border and&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump reveals a new plan to challenge Kamala Harris, with his team concentrating on two key policies they believe can strongly oppose Democrats. first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-reveals-a-new-plan-to-challenge-kamala-harris-with-his-team-concentrating-on-two-key-policies-they-believe-can-strongly-oppose-democrats/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rewrite-this-title-Trump-unveils-bold-new-strategy-to-take.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 21:20:46","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.098},{"id":254902298,"title":"Donald Trump Will Announce More Democratic Supporters—RFK Jr.","text":"In an interview appearance on Fox News Sunday, Robert F.

Powell did not say when rate cuts would begin or how large they might be, but the Fed is widely expected to announce a modest quarter-point cut in its benchmark rate when it meets in mid-September. “The time has come for policy to adjust,” Powell said in his keynote speech at the Fed’s annual economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. “The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.” His reference to multiple rate cuts was the only hint that a series of reductions is likely. Powell stressed that inflation, after the worst price spike in four decades inflicted pain on millions of households, appears largely under control. According to the Fed’s preferred measure, inflation fell to 2.5 per cent last month, far below its peak of 7.1 per cent two years ago and only slightly above the central bank’s two per cent target level. “My confidence has grown,” he said, “that inflation is on a sustainable path back to two per cent”. Powell’s assessment signalled that the Fed is making a fundamental shift from its two and a half years fight against inflation, toward a broader effort to keep the economy growing and employers hiring. The Fed chair’s assurance that rate cuts are coming helped fuel a rally on Wall Street. Bond yields fell, and stock indexes were broadly higher. “The only question remaining for the September 18 meeting is: By how much will the Fed be cutting?” said chief economist Joseph LaVorgna at SMBC Nikko Securities. “The outcome of the August employment report,” which will be reported September 6, LaVorgna said, “is obviously critical”. If that report shows a second straight month of weak hiring, the Fed may cut its key rate by a more aggressive half-point. Most economists expect the Fed to cut its benchmark rate by a quarter-point at each of its final three meetings this year. Wall Street traders, though, foresee a one-in-three likelihood that the Fed will cut by a half-point at one of those meetings, according to futures prices. A lower Fed benchmark rate will lead eventually to lower rates for auto loans, mortgages and other forms of consumer borrowing and could also boost stock prices. In his remarks over the weekend, the Fed chair suggested that rate cuts should help extend the much sought-after “soft landing”, whereby inflation falls back to the Fed’s two per cent target without a recession occurring. Continued growth could boost Vice President Kamala Harris’ presidential campaign, even as most Americans say they’re dissatisfied with the Biden-Harris administration’s economic record, largely because average consumer prices remain far above where they were before the pandemic. “We will do everything we can,” Powell said, “to support a strong labour market as we make further progress toward price stability.” By cutting rates, he said, “there is good reason to think that the economy will get back to two per cent inflation while maintaining a strong labour market”. A rate cut in mid-September, coming less than two months before the presidential election, could bring some unwelcome political heat on the Fed, which seeks to avoid becoming entangled in election-year politics. Former President Donald Trump has argued that the Fed shouldn’t cut rates so close to an election. But Powell has repeatedly underscored that the central bank would make its rate decisions based purely on economic data, without regard to the political calendar. In his remarks, Powell said the Fed has grown concerned about slower hiring and a rising unemployment rate, even while it still wants to see inflation fall further. That dual focus is replacing the Fed’s previous singular focus on inflation. “The cooling in labour market conditions is unmistakable,” the Fed chair said. “Job gains remain solid but have slowed this year. We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labour market conditions.” In what amounted to something of a victory lap, Powell noted that the Fed had succeeded in conquering high inflation without causing a recession or a sharp rise in unemployment, which many economists had long predicted. The soft landing “did come as a big surprise to the (economics) profession”, Gauti Eggertson, an economist at Brown University, said during a presentation on Friday at the Jackson Hole conference. He attributed that outcome to the unraveling of the pandemic’s disruptions to supply chains and labour markets and a reduction in job vacancies, which allowed wage growth to cool. Powell noted that, according to surveys and financial market gauges, Americans never really expected high inflation to stick. Such expectations can become self-fulfilling: If people expect inflation to stay high, they typically demand ever-higher pay or they accelerate their purchases before prices rise still further. Those steps can perpetuate higher inflation. But “inflation expectations” rose only modestly and have since largely fallen back to pre-pandemic levels. “The healing from pandemic distortions”, the Fed’s rate hikes and the fact that Americans did not expect higher inflation, “have worked together to put inflation on what increasingly appears to be a sustainable path to our two per cent objective”, the Fed chair said. Powell also addressed criticism that the Fed was too slow to raise rates even after inflation had begun surging once the pandemic recession ended.","summary":"","url":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/the-time-has-come-for-the-fed-to-soon-begin-reducing-interest-rates-powell/","image":"https://borneobulletin.com.bn/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/PAGE-10-D_26082024.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 21:05:19","author":null,"language":"en","source_country":"bn","sentiment":0.007},{"id":254902676,"title":"Fears of new Middle East war","text":"WILL ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH FIGHTING CONTINUE? Tensions are high on the Israel-Lebanon border after Israel and the militant group Hezbollah traded rocket fire on Sunday, raining missiles on military targets on both sides and renewing fears of a wider Middle East war. Israel said it used about 100 warplanes to strike rocket launchers across southern Lebanon to thwart an imminent Hezbollah attack, while Lebanese militants said they aimed hundreds of rockets and drones at military bases in northern Israel and the Golan Heights. “Sunday’s exchange of fire did not set off a long-feared war, and the heavy firepower and lack of civilian casualties might allow both sides to claim a sort of victory and step back,” the Associated Press reports. “Israel has vowed to bring quiet to the border to allow its citizens to return to their homes. It says it prefers to resolve the issue diplomatically through [the] US and other mediators but will use force if necessary. Hezbollah officials have said the group does not seek a wider war but is prepared for one.” Early this morning Australian time, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said in a televised speech his militants could carry out further strikes against Israel. Hezbollah has said its attack was in retaliation for Israel’s assassination of the group’s most senior military official, Fuad Shukr, in late July. Nasrallah said Israel began striking Hezbollah targets about half an hour before the militants were set to begin their operation. “What happened was aggression, not preemptive action,” Nasrallah said of the Israeli strikes, according to CNN. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also indicated overnight the fighting may continue: “This is not the end of the matter,” he said. Hezbollah — which is a key backer of the Gaza-based militant group Hamas — last fought a monthlong war with Israel in 2006, and the conflict ongoing since October last year is seen as the largest escalation since then. AIRLINES ON NOTICE Airlines and airports would have to pay back customers for unreasonable delays and cancellations, and a standalone ombudsman would be created for the sector, under reforms proposed in a federal government aviation white paper to be released today. “Customers deserve to get their money back if they are owed it. Full stop. It is time to take strong action to protect consumer rights with an aviation industry ombuds scheme and charter of customer rights,” Transport Minister Catherine King said, according to The Australian. The new ombudsman would replace the current Airline Customer Advocate — funded by airlines — which had a 100% increase in complaints in 2022 and only managed to solve less than half, The Sydney Morning Herald reports. “Under the government’s plan, airlines will have to detail reasons for delays and cancellations as part of their regulator reporting. The ombudsman will be able to request additional information about specific flights and will have the power to refer for legal action instances of misconduct under competition law,” the Herald’s story says. ON A LIGHTER NOTE… If you want to know the secret to a long life, hundred-year-olds are the wrong people to ask. That’s according to Richard Faragher, a professor of biogerontology — the study of aging — at the University of Brighton. He argues the lifestyles of individual people who grew to be among the world’s oldest matter less than we tend to think — and “survivorship bias” could obscure the fact that most centenarians are either “lucky” or genetically “well endowed”. “Merely because you have survived smoking 60 a day doesn’t mean that smoking 60 a day is good for you,” Faragher told The Guardian. His comments came after the death of the world’s oldest person, Spain’s Maria Branyas Morera, 117, who attributed her longevity to “order, tranquillity, good connection with family and friends, contact with nature, emotional stability, no worries, no regrets, lots of positivity and staying away from toxic people”.

Almost overnight, the fortunes of its favoured candidate appear to have gone into hard reverse. Against incumbent President Joe Biden, and in the immediate aftermath of an assassination attempt, Donald Trump’s election triumph seemed all but confirmed. But the embarrassing flailing in response to Kamala Harris’ ascendancy has seen a manic scrambling as the campaign tries to recalibrate. And with victory no longer assured, Trump’s once-loyal high-profile supporters are beginning to voice their concerns. Much has been made of far-right influencers such as Candace Owens, Laura Loomer and Nick Fuentes — some of Trump’s best-known and most high-profile supporters — criticising the trajectory of Trump’s campaign over the past week. But their discontent has been brewing for months.

The party will now form majority government, led by Lia Finocchiaro, one of the youngest chief ministers in the NT’s history and the first female CLP chief minister. Labor’s Eva Lawler came into the chief minister position eight months ago, after Natasha Fyles’ resignation over undisclosed shares. Pacific nations aren’t asking for favours. They just want Australia to meet the moment on climate justice — Tim Flannery (Guardian Australia): My first visit to the Pacific Islands was in 1981 and, for two decades, I spent several months each year carrying out biodiversity surveys and conservation work there. Even in the 1980s, Pacific communities were acutely aware of climate change, experiencing it first-hand through rising seas and intensifying storms. Over time, their understanding of the role that climate pollution plays in worsening these impacts has deepened, leading to a highly organised movement to limit pollution from big coal and gas exporters such as Australia. As the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) approaches, Australia must urgently align with the position of its Pacific neighbours and take decisive action to reduce climate pollution further and faster. The PIF has 18 members, including Australia and New Zealand, and is a critical space where leaders can meet as equals to tackle pressing issues, with climate change always at the forefront. Through this, Pacific nations have asserted their sovereignty and worked to drive stronger global action on climate change.","summary":"Neither Hezbollah nor Israel seem willing to back down after a new escalation in fighting, and the federal government is cracking down on airlines.\n\n\nThe post Fears of new Middle East war appeared first on Crikey.","url":"https://www.crikey.com.au/2024/08/26/israel-hezbollah-conflict-lebanon-airline-ombudsman/","image":"https://www.crikey.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/hez.jpg?quality=70","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 21:01:14","author":"Anton Nilsson","authors":["Anton Nilsson"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"au","sentiment":-0.348},{"id":254902278,"title":"Meta admits 'error' in taking down conservative college's Facebook page","text":"Facebook shut down Hillsdale College's online courses page the same day the school launched a course critical of Communism and Marxism. \"The @hillsdaleonline Facebook page has been down since Monday night, just as we launched a new course on Marxism, socialism, and communism,\" the school stated on X. \"Facebook is denying people access to our course on repressive ideologies.

Women say a female president is long overdue","text":"“Electric.” “Joyful.” The kinetic energy powering Kamala Harris ’ whirlwind presidential campaign carries the hopeful aspirations of history and the almost quaint idea of electing the first woman to the White House. But inside it, too, is the urgent and determined refusal of many Democratic female voters to accept the alternative—again. “Serious.” “Unapologetic.” Listen to the women cheering “We’re not going back!” at the Harris campaign rallies. See them singing along during the dance party roll call at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. Understand the mothers and daughters and sorority sisters and, yes, the men, brothers, and boys who have watched and waited and winced as the country tried eight years ago to break the glass ceiling—and failed. “Overdue.” This time, this year, facing Donald Trump again, a certain and influential swath of the electorate is not messing around. “It’s our time,” said Denise Delegol, 60, a retired postal worker from West Bloomfield Township, Michigan. Harris campaign reignites Democratic party’s enthusiasm The promise of a Harris presidency is shaking a sizable segment of the nation out of a political funk, reviving the idea of a milestone election and an alternative to repeating the Trump era. It's putting the country on the cusp of what Michelle Obama, in her convention speech to Democrats, called a “brighter day.” Once President Joe Biden bowed out of the race and embraced his vice president at the top of the ticket, some found hope where before they had felt mostly dread. “Overnight it went from doom-scrolling to hope-scrolling,” said Lisa Hansen of Wisconsin, who led an early Trump resistance group in 2017 as her first foray into political activism. Lori Goldman of Michigan, who founded Fems for Dems to elect Hillary Clinton two presidents ago, said, “I’m too old to not ever have seen a president that’s female in the United States.” She's 65. And Shannon Nash, an attorney from California and, like Harris, a fellow member of the historic Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Inc., said from the convention hall Thursday night, “The joy is coming back to politics.” Women have been here before, in 2016, when they donned matching pantsuits, poured champagne, and settled in on election night, some with friends and daughters by their side, expecting Clinton to win the White House—only to be shaken by Trump’s victory. As one woman said at the time, she threw up the next morning. THIS TIME FEELS “different” For those voting for Harris, this election feels more joyful, but also more necessary and urgent. “We need to do this, be serious about it this time,” said Monique LaFonta, a mother of two twin girls, after attending a Harris rally in Milwaukee. Trump’s creation of a conservative Supreme Court majority that overturned a woman’s right to abortion access produced outrage among many women who powered that year's midterm election—and are a potentially influential force in this one. “We are living in just such a wildly different situation,” said Jessica Mackler, the president of Emily’s List, which works to elect pro-choice women. She said Harris is “unapologetic” when it comes to reproductive rights. Harris herself carries this potentially history-making moment not as a campaign feature but a matter-of-fact representation of who she is and has always been, much the way Barack Obama often left his race merely implied to voters. Rather than reminding voters that the nation's 47th president could become the first in its more than two-century history to not be a man, Harris is running instead on what she would do in the job and how she would do it. In her speech Thursday night accepting the nomination at the Democratic National Convention, Harris acknowledged that she's \"no stranger to unlikely journeys,” but she did not specifically mention the historic nature of her candidacy. Many receive her style as a brand of American optimism rooted in the generations who came before her, a Black and South Asian woman, the daughter of immigrants—a Jamaican father and Indian mother—who dared to dream in this country. She is blaring Beyonce’s “Freedom” as her campaign theme song along the way. Clinton’s defeat paved the way for this moment So much has changed in the American political landscape since Trump entered that scene almost a decade ago with his braggadocio and electoral momentum. “Such a nasty woman,” he called his 2016 Democratic rival Clinton, a former U.S. senator and secretary of state. “Horseface,” he labeled a Republican primary rival, a woman. “Fat pig,” he bullied a famous female comedian. He once bragged that as a celebrity he could “grab” women by their private parts—and get away with it. More than 1 million people in the United States and around the world filled city streets in protest the day after Trump’s 2017 inauguration. Many wore pink “pussy” hats. “The Resistance,” they called it. Trump himself has stayed the course, deriding Harris as “Laffin’ Kamala,” mocking her laugh, or mispronouncing her name, which means “lotus flower” in Sanskrit. In many ways, Clinton’s defeat eight years ago set the stage for this moment. It was a crushing setback that dashed women’s hopes for bringing the U.S. into alignment with leading democracies around the world that have had a female in charge. Angie Gialloreto of Pittsburgh was disappointed then. But the 95-year-old, attending her 13th presidential convention, is still at it, ready and waiting for the country to try again. “It's time,” she said. * * * Many of the women interviewed by The Associated Press this week are eager for what's next. Listen to what they have to say. MONIQUE LAFONTA, 41, Milwaukee, health care consultant and mother of twin daughters: “Why can’t a woman be president? Why has it taken us so long to get to this point?” LaFonta wondered the day after a Harris rally in Milwaukee. “Are we going to make the same mistake again?” LaFonta remembers celebrating election night 2016 at a birthday party with friends when Clinton lost to Trump. “It was unintentionally the worst birthday party I ever went to — everyone was crying at the end of the night,” she said. As a mother now, she said what’s happened with the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the threats posed by the Project 2025 agenda are “scary.” “I have two 6-year-old daughters who have less rights than I did,” she said. Originally from Louisiana, she recalls her parents living through the Jim Crow era in the South. “I never even thought we would see a Black president in my lifetime,” she said. “To have another glass ceiling like that in my lifetime, it’s really so special.” At the Harris rally in Milwaukee this week, it was “so electric, so contagious,” she said. “Just joy.” ASHBEY BEASLEY, 48, Highland Park, Illinois, stay-home mother “We’re overdue,” Beasley said. She remembers watching one state after another fall to Trump on election night eight years ago. “I just started crying,” she said. “We turned the TV off.” The difference between then and now? “We’ve had a Trump presidency. We’ve seen the kind of chaos.\" The Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol was a “turning point” she said. “The MAGA culture came out of the closet,” and a lot of people “were like, I’m not OK with this.” Having survived a 2022 mass shooting in her city with her son, she has become a gun safety advocate and worries Trump is too close to gun rights groups. “What I want people to know whatever you see out in the world — whatever horrific terrible tragedy — that can be you,” she said from the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. “Just because you don’t need an abortion right now, doesn’t mean you won’t.” LORI GOLDMAN, Michigan, founded Fems for Dems in 2016 to elect Hillary Clinton At 65, she said, “I’m too old to not ever have seen a president that’s female in the United States.” On Election Day 2016, Goldman had about 30 people to her house and they canvassed until the afternoon, all the while thinking it unnecessary. She said she’s less naïve now. For Goldman and chair of Fems for Dems Marcie Paul, the difference between organizing in 2016 and now is knowing the impacts of a Trump administration. Both are mothers, and they cited their daughters’ futures as a reason to vote Harris, both for her policy on reproductive rights and for her potential to be the first female president. Paul said it’s the most important election of a lifetime. “But really — this time it is.” ANNE HATHAWAY, Indiana, the state's Republican National Committeewoman She dismissed the potential history-making milestone as been there, done that. “We had Hillary Clinton as a candidate in 2016 so this is not a new phenomenon,” said Hathaway, who was in charge of the arrangements committee at the Republican convention. She said she is focused on the candidates’ visions, not their genders. “This is a race between two presidential candidates who have very different opinions and views and where they think this country should go.” HOLLY SARGENT, York, Maine She had spent the months leading up to the 2016 presidential election campaigning for Hillary Clinton in her quiet Maine beach town, watching the rise of Trump “with horror.” But she said the despair she felt at that year’s election defeat was healed with Clinton’s speech to the Democratic convention this week. Sargent teared up as she sat with Maine delegates thinking of all that has transpired, and could yet. “We’re going to do it this time. And when we do it, we do it for Hillary and for Shirley Chisholm and for Geraldine Ferraro and for all of the extraordinary women who have gone before.” JENNIFER RICHARDSON, 44, Albany, New York, attorney She said as a Black woman, and an attorney, having Harris atop the party’s ticket resonates so much. “I see myself in her,” she said from the Democratic convention. “I see all my friends in her.” Added Richardson, “For her to win, it’s like we all won.” DENISE DELEGOL, 60, West Bloomfield Township, Michigan, retired postal worker Delegol was decked out in pearls, a purple Harris “When We Fight We Win” T-shirt and purple high-tops decorated with the word “WIN” on the toes outside the convention hall. “It’s a beautiful thing that she can lead a country that was predominantly led by old white men who think they know what’s best for all, all people, including women and our bodies,” she said. Harris, she said, “is going to change all that.” She wants her fellow Americans to understand how important the election is, and that “this is just a time for all Americans to come together because we have more in common than not in common.” Her conversations with family and friends are all about what’s happening. “Now it’s our time,” she said. “And I don’t think nothing can stop us now, as far as women breaking the glass ceiling.” LIZ SHULER, president, AFL-CIO union Schuler recalls breaking out the champagne and popcorn with friends on election night 2016, before “people left, of course, heartbroken.” This time around, she said, “we are protecting our hearts.” “I think every woman you talked to probably feels the same way. But I think we, as union women, pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off and just keep up the fight.” ANGIE GIALLORETO, 95, Pittsburgh, attending her 13th presidential nominating convention Gialloreto said she was disappointed by Clinton’s loss eight years ago, but she’s excited with Harris in place to try again. “It’s time,” she said from the convention hall. Gialloreto has attended every Democratic convention since Jimmy Carter was nominated for president in 1976. She said it’s an exciting time, “not for me, I’ve lived my life — for the short time I have, I’m going to celebrate — but it’s the young ones. “Reality is here.”","summary":"“Electric.” “Joyful.”\n\n\n\nThe kinetic energy powering Kamala Harris ’ whirlwind presidential campaign carries the hopeful aspirations of history and the almost quaint idea of electing the first woman to the White House.

The Wall Street Journal reported Sunday that the Republican nominee is planning to ramp up his aggressive campaign to pour cold water on Harris' sustained momentum. He previewed the attacks he'll likely go with on these topics during Harris' speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC), during which he commented live over on Truth Social. 'Kamala's biography won't lower prices at the grocery store, or at the pump!' he wrote, referencing her stories about her immigrant mother and her work as a prosecutor. 'She said, \"chart a new way forward,\" but she’s had three and a half years, and has done nothing but HARM!' In all caps, he also threw her record as the 'border czar' in her face, something Democrats have been trying to protect her from ever since it became clear she'd be the candidate instead of Joe Biden. Campaign insiders say former President Donald Trump is ready to refocus on the issues and hit Kamala Harris and the Democrats where it hurts most Trump and his allies believe Harris is the weakest on the border and the economy Read More JFK expert reveals stunning assassination theory as Trump vows to release secret documents Biden dropping out of the race seems to have shocked what was a sluggish campaign trail for both candidates. The race has become what Americans typically expect this deep into presidential election years: daily rallies and constant media appearances. Trump advisers say he will be much more active on the stump going forward, the WSJ reported. He is set address a National Guard conference in Detroit on Monday. He'll be in Michigan and Wisconsin all day Thursday and holding events. Then, to cap off upcoming week, he'll fly over to Pennsylvania for a rally. Against Trump's instincts, advisers have set up smaller events for him so he can focus on the issues at hand and actively appeal to undecided voters and independents rather than the roaring MAGA fans who go to rallies and are already with him. On Thursday, for instance, he held a more muted event in front of the border wall in Cochise County, Arizona, where he said Biden and Harris squandered taxpayer money by letting materials for wall construction go to waste. At the border event in Arizona, he invited relatives of Americans killed by illegal immigrants to tell their stories After families from Texas and Maryland revealed the heart-wrenching details of their loved ones’ brutal deaths, Trump announced policy priorities to prevent future tragedies At the event, he invited relatives of Americans killed by illegal immigrants and allowed them to tell their devastating stories that also professed their support for him and the dangers of Harris' border policy. ‘We will seal the border, stop the invasion, and launch the largest deportation effort in American history,’ Trump said after the families spoke. Trump is also bringing back his campaign manager from his first run in 2016, Corey Lewandowski. Lewandowski will reportedly act as another sounding board for Trump, while also making loads of TV appearances himself in the coming weeks. Taylor Budowich is another key, if lesser known, ally jumping on board. He joins the campaign after running the MAGA PAC, a pro-Trump super PAC, and is said to have a strong rapport with Trump. Insiders say he's good at giving advice, expecting his counsel to be crucial in keeping Trump on message. Now that Biden is out of the race, Trump is looking for potent attack lines against Harris One that seems to be gaining traction is that Harris is stealing Trump policies, the chief one being his idea to abolish taxes on tips That's especially important now that Biden is out of the race. Out of habit, Trump continued attacking the current president well after he dropped out, but now he's looking for attack lines that work well against Harris specifically. One retort that he seems to have settled on is that the vice president is stealing his policies. Trump vowed to abolish the tax on tips for service workers during a June 9 rally in Las Vegas, even pitching the idea to congressional Republicans days later. Harris made the same promise two weeks ago, prompting many on the right to call her out for jacking one of Trump's popular olive branches to the working class. Trump had a repeat rally Friday in Las Vegas, where this idea could really appeal to casino workers in Nevada who rely on tips to make a living. 'She's a copycat,' Trump said on stage. Beyond new attacks and smaller, more issue-focused events, Trump and his surrogates plan to make inroads with voters through more nontraditional avenues. Trump and his surrogates expect to go on more podcasts to appeal to young men. Trump recently appeared on the podcast of comedian Theo Von, left Another attempt to connect with young men was when Trump appeared on a stream with internet personality Adin Ross earlier this month This means expect Trump to do things similar to his interview with Elon Musk on X or his podcast sit-down with comedian Theo Von last week. This strategy, campaign officials are saying, is geared toward getting through to more undecided voters - mainly younger men - who are often likelier to listen to alternative media sources. The crème de le crème of the podcast world would obviously be Joe Rogan, who said in 2022 he turned down multiple requests from Trump to appear on his Spotify-hosted program. Trump has never publicly responded to this claim but did attack Rogan this month for saying positive things about Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has since dropped out of the race and endorsed Trump. The Trump campaign also wants to book surrogates on podcasts geared more toward black male audiences, such as 'Earn Your Leisure,' 'Market Mondays and others, the WSJ reported. Trump and his allies have reportedly shown frustration about the upward trajectory of the Harris campaign but expect this momentum to level off. While Trump and co. are concerned about the energy surrounding the Harris campaign, most polling aggregators only have Harris up nationally by 1.5 to 3.6 points, which is well within the margin of error for most individual polls Most polling aggregators have Harris up nationally by 1.5 to 3.6 points, which is well within the margin of error for most individual polls. At a North Carolina event on Wednesday billed as an address on national security issues, Trump outsourced his campaign strategizing to his own supporters. While lamenting over how former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle levied 'very nasty' attacks at him during the DNC, he asked rallygoers whether he should use personal attacks or not. The crowd overwhelmingly indicated that he should. 'My advisers are fired,' Trump joked. 'I would rather keep it on policy. Sometimes it’s hard when you’re attacked on all ends.'

With some of those polls, you had to look to the cross tabs and see that they had questionable methodology including oversampling Democrats or having too small a sample to be reliable. So, it’s hard to make a judgment about the polls when you’re getting questionable data. Now in the middle of all that, there was an admission by officials with a top, pro-Harris super PAC that their polling for Kamala Harris ‘is much less rosy’ than public surveys” Chauncey McLean, president of Future Forward said this past week. He warned that the race was much closer in the key states. The group has spoken to more than 375,000 people: McLean said polling shows the public wants more detailed policy positions from Harris.He says they don’t want “white papers,” but they also don’t want platitudes. He says they need more concrete examples of how she may differ from Biden and make their lives easier economically. Trump allies have called on Harris to do the same in recent days, hoping to pin her down on controversial issues. Then we saw the betting markets flip toward former President Donald Trump, something you wouldn’t expect with the DNC on, you would think the bump would go to them. But it was such a mess and Harris still didn’t put out any real policies or plans. Are Americans really going to be taken in by such a convention? But even before we can get to any real poll results to tell, Harris may have gotten a body blow from Robert F. Kennedy Jr’s endorsement of Trump. First, pollster Frank Luntz said that could be the deciding factor in some of the battleground states in favor of Trump.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nWe&#8217;ve been seeing the media try to hype up Kamala Harris since&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Trump Advisor Reveals Significant Poll Results Regarding RFK Jr. Endorsement That Kamala Won&#8217;t Approve first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/trump-advisor-reveals-significant-poll-results-regarding-rfk-jr-endorsement-that-kamala-wont-approve/","image":"https://media.townhall.com/cdn/hodl/2024/236/be25fa5a-7af7-482a-a998-161aa2aca2ed.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 20:53:18","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.34},{"id":254901266,"title":"Fox News Host Confronts Trump Adviser With 'Positive' Biden Economic Record","text":"On Fox News' Media Buzz, host Howard Kurtz posed a straightforward question to former President Donald Trump's senior adviser Jason Miller about President Joe Biden's administration's economic achievements, focusing on the recent stock market rally that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average surpass 41,000 points.Kurtz question came in response to criticism of the Biden's administration's economic record. Inflation has spiked over the past four years, and the administration has consistently received low marks on its handling of the economy from voters in polls. However, as Kurtz noted, the overall economy is now doing quite well, according to multiple indicators and many economists.\"You have every right to say that she [Vice President Kamala Harris] was part of this administration whose record, uh, you criticize, and obviously some of it is unpopular. Don't they also get credit for things that are positive for example, the record-breaking stock market? Dow broke 41,000 on Friday,\" Kurtz inquired, referencing the recent market milestone.Miller, a long-time Trump loyalist, responded by attributing the market's performance to anticipation of a potential MAGA return to the White House.\"Well, that's simply because businesses think that President Trump is gonna come back in, and so they're energized,\" Miller stated.Many online users immediately shot down Miller's dismissal of Biden's economic achievements and responded to him on X, formerly Twitter.Newsweek contacted the Trump campaign and Biden's office via email on Saturday for comment.The senior adviser then pivoted to discuss the recent endorsement of Trump by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who suspended his independent presidential campaign the previous week.Miller emphasized the potential impact of Kennedy's support, stating, \"A big part of that, that RFK junior endorsement that we had on Friday, which is huge, when you look at the numbers state by state, some of the states could be upwards of 13,000 to 20,000 votes. Other states, the RFK Jr endorsement could boost by as much as 40 or even 50,000 votes.\"While the Biden administration has pointed to job growth, declining inflation, and stock market gains as evidence of its economic stewardship, Republicans have consistently criticized the president's policies, citing concerns over federal spending and energy costs.Miller's focus on Kennedy's endorsement reflects the Trump campaign's strategy to capitalize on potential third-party support. Recent polling analysis by RacetotheWH suggests that Kennedy's inclusion as a third-party candidate could significantly impact the electoral map in key swing states.In Nevada and North Carolina, the analysis indicates that Kennedy's presence on the ballot could potentially flip these states from Democratic to Republican control in a match-up between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.The impact varies across battleground states, with Kennedy potentially drawing between 3.4 percent to 5.6 percent of the vote in crucial contests.The RacetotheWH analysis provides a state-by-state breakdown of the potential impact. In Arizona, Harris leads Trump by 0.5 points in a head-to-head race, but her lead increases to 0.9 points when third-party candidates are included.Georgia shows Trump with a 1.8-point lead over Harris in a direct contest, which slightly decreases to 1.7 points with third-party candidates in the mix. Meanwhile, Michigan sees Harris leading Trump by 2.9 points in a two-way race, but this lead narrows to 1.8 points when third-party candidates are factored in.In Nevada, Harris has a slim 0.4-point lead in a head-to-head matchup, but Trump takes the lead by 0.8 points when third-party candidates are included.North Carolina shows Harris with a narrow 0.2-point lead in a direct contest, which shifts to a 0.7-point lead for Trump when third-party candidates are added.Pennsylvania gives Harris a one-point lead over Trump in a straight fight, which increases to 1.4 points with the inclusion of third-party candidates.Wisconsin shows Harris leading by 2.1 points in a head-to-head race, with her lead expanding to 2.9 points when third-party candidates are considered.","summary":"Jason Miller downplayed the president's accomplishments while touting Trump's RFK Jr. endorsement.","url":"https://www.newsweek.com/jason-miller-donald-trump-joe-biden-rfk-media-buzz-fox-news-1944171","image":"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2457664/jason-miller.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-08-25 20:44:15","author":"Adeola Adeosun","authors":["Adeola Adeosun"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.003},{"id":254903208,"title":"Wildfires in Brazil leave at least 2 dead in Sao Paulo state.

Because in the campaign season of 2024, just as in the fabric of American culture at large, the notion of “story” is everywhere. This year’s political conventions were, like so many of their kind, curated collections of elaborate stories carefully spun to accomplish one goal — getting elected. But lurking behind them was a pitched, high-stakes battle over how to frame the biggest story of all — the one about America that, as Harris put it, should be “the next great chapter in the most extraordinary story ever told.” The American story — an unlikely one, filled with twists that sometimes feel, as so many enjoy saying, “just like a movie” — sits at the nucleus of American culture for a unique reason. Americans live in one of the only societies that was built not upon hundreds of years of common culture but upon stories themselves — “the shining city upon the hill,” “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,” “all men are created equal.” Even memorable ad campaigns — ” Baseball ,hot dogs, apple pie and Chevrolet ” — are part of this. In some ways, the United States — not coincidentally, the place where the frontier myth, Hollywood and Madison Avenue were all born — willed itself into existence and significance by iterating and reiterating its story as it went. The campaigns understand that. So they are putting forward to voters two varying — starkly opposite, some might say — versions of the American story. How the two parties are using stories From the Republicans comes one flavor of the story: an insistence that to “make America great again” in the future we must fight to reinvigorate traditional values and reclaim the moral fiber and stoutheartedness of generations past. In his convention speech last month, Trump invoked three separate conflicts — the Revolutionary War, the Civil War and World War II — in summoning American history’s glories. To reinforce its vision, the GOP deployed the likes of musician Kid Rock, celebrity wrestler Hulk Hogan and Lee Greenwood singing “God Bless the USA.” Trump genuflected to the firefighting gear of Corey Comperatore, who had been killed in an assassination attempt on the candidate days earlier. Vance spoke of “villains” and offered up the Appalachian coming-of-age story he told in “Hillbilly Elegy.” The Republicans, as they often do, leaned into military storylines, bringing forth families of slain servicemen to critique President Joe Biden’s “weak” leadership. And they made all efforts to manage their constituencies. Vance’s wife, Usha, who is of Indian descent, lauded him as “a meat-and-potatoes kind of guy” — a classic American trope — while underscoring that he respected her vegetarian diet and had learned how to cook Indian food for her mother. “What could I say that hasn’t already been said before?” she said, introducing Vance. “After all, the man was already the subject of a Ron Howard movie.” And the Democrats? Their convention last week focused on a new and different future full of “joy” and free of what Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg called “Trump’s politics of darkness.” It was an implied “Star Wars” metaphor if there ever was one. It was hard to miss that the Democrats were not only coalescing around the multiracial, multicultural nation that Harris personifies but at the same time methodically trying to reclaim the plainspoken slivers of the American story that have rested in Republican hands in recent years. The flag was everywhere, as was the notion of freedom. Tim Walz entered to the tune of John Mellencamp’s “Small Town,” an ode to the vision of America that Republicans usually trumpet. Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota expounded upon the regular-guy traits that Walz embodies — someone who can change a car light, a hunter, a “dad in plaid.” The former geography teacher’s football-coach history was mined as well, with beefy guys in Mankato West Scarlets jerseys fanning out across the stage to the marching-band strains of “The Halls of Montezuma.” They even enlisted a former GOP member of Congress to reinforce all the imagery by saying the quiet part loud. “I want to let my fellow Republicans in on the secret: The Democrats are as patriotic as us,” said Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican critical of Trump. Bringing it all together Watching the videos and testimonials at both conventions, one storytelling technique stood tall: what journalists call “character-driven” tales. Whether it’s advocating for abortion rights or warning about mass illegal immigration or channeling anger about inflation, “regular” Americans became the narrative building blocks for national concerns. Historian Heather Cox Richardson put it this way about the DNC in her Substack, “Letters from an American,” this past week: “The many stories in which ordinary Americans rise from adversity through hard work, decency, and service to others implicitly conflates those individual struggles with the struggles of the United States itself.” In the past generation, the tools of storytelling have become more democratic. We are all publishers now — on X, on TikTok, on Instagram, on Truth Social. And we are all storytellers, telling mini versions of the American story in whatever ways we wish. Perspectives that have been long silenced and suppressed are making their way into the light. Putting aside questions of truth and misinformation for a moment, how can a unifying American story be summoned when hundreds of millions of people are now able to tell it differently and from their own vantage points? Democratization is beneficial, but it can also be chaotic and hard to understand. “A people who cannot stand together cannot stand at all,” poet Amanda Gorman said in her remarks at the DNC. But with so many stories to sort through, is unity more difficult than ever? Is there even a single, unifying “American story” at all? Should there be? In the meantime, the attempts to commandeer and amplify versions of that story will continue to Election Day and beyond. As long as there is an American nation, there will be millions of people trying to tell us what it means — desperately, angrily, optimistically, compellingly. Stories are a powerful weapon and a potent metaphor as well. As Walz said about leaving Trump and Vance behind: “I’m ready to turn the page.” Ted Anthony, director of new storytelling and newsroom innovation at The Associated Press, has been writing about American culture and politics for 35 years.

Polls show US Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump are neck and neck. Over the last several years, we’ve seen presidential elections decided by slimmer and slimmer margins, and 2024 will likely be no different. There’s one thing that links these historically close election results in recent years -- and that’s the voting behavior of America’s moderate women and particularly moderate white women. There are 49 million moderate white women nationwide, and they make up a large percentage of the undecided bloc in key states. They are movable, they are without a political home, they are looking for a candidate who speaks to them and their concerns, and they are going to show up at the polls in November. Understanding this key voting bloc is one of the reasons I founded Galvanize Action — an organization committed to listening to and learning who these women are and why they vote the way they do. Democracy relies on conversation, and we need everyone — including those in the middle — to stay engaged. Ultimately, our work supports civic engagement, even when it can be tempting to avoid the conflict of our increasingly polarized political environment. To that end, Galvanize Action just released new research and data on what is top of mind for moderate women this election cycle. In a late July survey, 31 percent of moderate white women said they had not yet committed to a decision about who to vote for in the presidential election. Before President Joe Biden stepped aside, Galvanize Action took a look at how other candidates would compare to Trump. When it came to the top potential Democratic candidates, Harris performed the best -- with 39 percent choosing Harris versus 42 percent choosing Trump. This result is within the margin of error, and it shows Harris is very much within striking distance of Trump among moderate white women. The research also showed they are very close in terms of candidate favorability as well, with 44 percent of moderate white women viewing Harris favorably, compared with 45 percent for Trump. When asked to identify the top issue this election, an overwhelming majority said the economy. In fact, 42 percent of moderate women marked the economy as their No. 1 concern. In our research over the last year, this audience has specifically expressed increased anxiety around the economy as a result of the stress of putting food on the table, running a household and generally serving as primary caregivers for their families. In those survey results, Galvanize Action found that large majorities of women said they believe the government has a role in ensuring access to the resources and support they need to provide the best care for their children and families. Moderate white women want to not just make ends meet, but also to thrive, so any candidate looking to win this critical voting bloc over would be wise to speak to these issues. A second key issue that moderate white women are basing their voting decisions on this election will be reproductive freedom. In the wake of the Dobbs decision, reproductive rights are at the forefront of women’s minds -- with 75 percent saying this issue is important to them when casting their vote. Moderate women want to see who will tangibly make their lives and their families’ lives better, and they want to understand who will provide certainty and stability by protecting the freedoms that many assumed were settled law until now. Finally, what I’ve learned in my work over the years with moderate women is that they’re sick of the division. Winning candidates will be able to make arguments around the issues, of course, but they’ll also be effective in showing this group their desire for unity and steadiness in this country. Grievance-based rhetoric that pits us against each other cannot be countered by doubling down with more hate, more fear and darker warnings of threat. Unsurprisingly, these are the key issues that a broad swath of voters care about -- not just moderate women and moderate white women. Women of all races, ethnicities and backgrounds want economic stability, the freedom to make their own reproductive health care choices and the end of harmful divisions. When it comes to moderate white women, though, they are still looking for their political home. The candidate who can speak to these issues they care about the most will come out victorious.

What a scandalousseven daysit's been: Jermaine Jenas got a red card from the BBC, Bennifer called it quits for good, andKamala and Donald engaged in a game of Top Trumps with rival Kennedys..... There's a lot to tackle... So join me, Daily Mirror columnist Jessica Boulton, for Jess Saying, my wry, witty and oh-so-whimsical round up of the shocking showbiz week.... Madge-ic Monday Madonna took her closest friends out for dinner on her birthday this week. Which on the face of it, makes the superstar seem just like us . Especially as she opted for my favourite – Italian. But, let’s face it, Madge is the undisputed Lucky Star Queen of Pop. Taking her nearest and dearest to Pizza Express, however yummy their dough balls are, is not going to be on her dance card. No, when Madge does Italian, she does Italian. Which is why she opted to -celebrate her 66th birthday with an Italian feast... in an actual Italian -amphitheatre in historic Pompeii. Or as otherwise known, the UNESCO World Heritage Site, which has been preserved in volcanic ash since Mount Vesuvius erupted in 79AD. I wonder what she’s planning for next year? A day of rock climbing... on the Wailing Wall perhaps? Or maybe a bit of karaoke and a dance-off in The Colosseum? Tough Love Tuesday Well, there you have it, folks – Bennifer has officially bitten the dust... again. For, it might be the year of long-awaited reboots, but while BeetleJuice Beetlejuice and Gladiator 2 are expected to recapture their decades-old success, the sequel to 2003’s biggest Hollywood love story has totally and utterly bombed. On Tuesday, Jennifer Lopez filed for divorce from Ben Affleck, exactly two years to the day of their wedding party in Georgia, where they declared their love for each other, 19 years after cancelling their first wedding. It was the rom-com fairytale ending that had us all nostalgic for the early Noughties – a time when we wore dresses over jeans, doused ourselves in glitter body spray, and considered Bennifer to be one of the celebrity power couples of the day... just behind, er, theotherBennifer (Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston). To this day, I still can’t watch an Angelina Jolie movie, so seeing at least one of the Bennifers enjoy a second shot of love was just the heartwarming, -post-pandemic pick-me-up us true romantics needed. Until it wasn’t. For, it turned out Jenny from the Block likes a night out in a posh frock... and broody Ben prefers to wallow at home in his batcave man cave. Hence… one giant dollop of -irreconcilable differences. And that’s the thing with love stories: they have to end in heartbreak one way or another. Now, next year, or in 70-odd years’ time. I guess that’s why we don’t see as many lovey-dovey movies getting a long-awaited sequel. It would kill the romance of the original. Imagine Casablanca 2 – that poignant goodbye, spoiled by Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart reuniting for some anti-climatic quickie fling 10 years later. Or Pretty Woman2, with Richard Gere locked up for kerb crawling after telling friends how he and Vivian met. Don’t even get me started on Romeo & Juliet 2. We’ve got enough zombie movies already. What the Foxtrot? Wednesday If Strictly thought they had PR -problems…US hit show Dance Moms got a kicking this week when an 11-year-old girl competed with a routine based on – wait for it ... ....the MURDER of… ....JonBenet Ramsey. YUP. That’s right: The six-year-old pageant girl whose case is still unsolved 18 years on. Let’s just say it was not a good day for taste when the episode dropped on Disney-owned Hulu this week. And it gets worse – the routine ended with the -pre-teen dancer pretending to be STRANGLED. It raises some very concerning questions. Chief of them being, what the foxtrot are they planning for the group dance category? A Charleston inspired by Al Capone’s St Valentine’s Day massacre? A streetdance in honour of Jack the Ripper? Or a lovely, flowy contemporary piece about the sinking of the Titanic? Trump Card? Thursday Talk about star power! Just six weeks ago I was one of the millions left devastated by -the assassination attempt on Donald Trump. Firstly, because of the poor victim in the crowd and their family. No one deserves that, whatever their politics. And secondly… because with that one single pull of a trigger, Teflon Don went from an all-bark no-bite underdog to an unstoppable shoo-in for the Oval. In fact, his victory seemed so nailed on, White House staff have probably already bulk-ordered the necessary stash of Diet Coke and gold spray paint. But a week is a long time in politics. And six weeks? Well, that’s an eternity. Or as Trump’s new groupie Liz Truss might call it: nearly an entire term for a UK prime minister. Yes, as Kamala Harris accepted the nomination for US president at the Democratic National Convention this week, it was clear we’d put the cart before the horse in declaring the race over (or the old fart before the donkey, to be more apt). Because it wasn’t just a comeback for the left. It was a Force awakening. With more stars than Han Solo sees in Hyperspace. Leading the rebel alliance against Don’s Dark Side was Luke Skywalker himself, Mark Hamill (with an impassioned speech about Carrie Fisher), followed by Spike Lee, Oprah Winfrey, Patti LaBelle, Stevie Wonder, Pink, The Obamas, Hillary Clinton, Desperate Housewife Eva Longoria, and… Wonder Woman, Lynda Carter. But who was their real, um, Trump card? This guy – the TikTok thirst trap/journalist/future-president Jack Schlossberg, who rocked up to give a speech at the DNC, declaring: “[Kamala] shares my grandfather’s energy, vision and optimism for our future.” That’ll be his late granddaddy, John F Kennedy. It was made all the more exciting as Donald had acquired his own unlikely Kennedy endorsement that very same day - when Robert Kennedy's 70-year-old namesake son shockingly u-turned after decades as a democrat and decided Orange Is the New Blue. RFK Jr's endorsement of Trump should have been the coup everyone was talking about: After all, The GOP is the antithesis of everything the Kennedys stand for. But even when you're a member of America's unofficial royal family, the old Orwellian saying still applies: Everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others. Yep....the already-farcical US election has suddenly turned into a giant game of.....Kennedy Top Trumps. So who do you think will have the better stats of their Top Trumps card? RFK Jr? The well-known anti-vaxxer, subject of a recent Vanity Fair investigation, vocal believer in 9/11 conspiracy theories and one-time host to a worm in his brain? The man of who has disgraced his father's good name, according to an op-ed by his brother Max this weekend. “To carry the name Robert F Kennedy Jr means a special legacy within a legacy...\" Max wrote. \"It is worse than disappointment. We are in mourning.\" Or Jack? The easy-on-the-eye grandson of America's most immortalised president? The 31-year-old environmentalist and Harvard Law grad who started a charity in middle school, spent two years working as a paramedic, loves animals and has youth, intelligence and an absolutely huge..... TikTok following on his side? I think the answer's obvious. Keep your Camelot in order for the next few months, Kamala, and you might find yourself sent to the big house .....(Not the same type we thought Trump might be heading for though). Feelgood Friday Proud Channing Tatum has been praising fiancee Zoe Kravitz for her “dogged” determination ahead of the release of Blink Twice, her first movie as a director. But he also let slip that the actress is a little less gung-ho when it comes to days off. “She really doesn’t do anything but watch movies,” he told a US men’s magazine. “She’s like, ‘I don’t do activities. I don’t go hiking. I just love movies.’” Apparently she can binge watch three in a day, which caused some disbelief on social media. But it sounds abs-olutely perfect tome. Imagine… Magic Mike before breakfast, Magic Mike XXL before lunch and Magic Mike: The Last Dance in the -afternoon. As for the evening? Well… that would be an exclusive performance of Magic Mike Live, of course. You lucky, lucky girl, Zoe. What do you think? Have you seen a celeb moment this week that made you laugh? Or one that made you raise your eyebrows?

Getty Images Key Facts Kristen Welker of NBC’s “Meet The Press” asked Vance whether he would commit that if he and Trump are elected, they would not impose a federal ban on abortion, to which Vance said he “can absolutely commit that.” Vance said Trump “wants to end this culture war over this particular topic” and said the federal government should be focused on things like “big economic and immigration questions” rather than abortion policies, which he said should be left to the states—echoing a view Trump has increasingly expressed. When pressed by Welker on whether Trump would veto a federal abortion ban if lawmakers send it to his desk, Vance said “I think he would. He’s said that explicitly that he would.” Trump has signaled support in the past for nationwide abortion rules that would stop short of an all-out ban in the past, suggesting he’s open to a federal ban on abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy as recently as March.

Crucial Quote “Donald Trump's view is that we want the individual states, and their individual cultures, and their unique political sensibilities to make these decisions because we don't want to have a nonstop federal conflict over this issue,” Vance told Welker on Sunday. Contra Vice President Kamala Harris and her allies used part of the Democratic National Convention to slam the GOP's stance on abortion and argue Trump could back a national ban, with Harris calling Republicans “out of their minds.” Trump, meanwhile, said in a Truth Social post he would be “great for women and their reproductive rights.” Key Background Abortion has become a key issue in the 2024 presidential race, with Democrats arguing Republicans could ban or heavily restrict the procedure if they win power, while Trump has most recently insisted the issue should be decided by the states—though his stance has changed over the years. In 1999 on “Meet the Press,” he said he hated “the concept of abortion” but was “very pro-choice.” But more than a decade later in 2011—when he was considering running for president—Trump said at the Conservative Political Action Conference he identified as “pro-life.” In 2016, he drew ire for saying if abortion is made illegal, “there has to be some form of punishment” for women who get the procedure—comments he later walked back. From there, Trump went back and forth on whether Planned Parenthood should be funded, saying in 2015 he was split on it and saying in a 2016 debate he would cut federal funding. Before he was elected in 2016, Trump said he would like the Supreme Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, and in 2022 the decades-old standard was overturned, allowing states to ban abortion. While he was in office, Trump supported a 20-week abortion ban that was passed in the House but did not make it through the Senate. Tangent For his part, Vance has described himself as pro-life but says he aligns with Trump in thinking states should make their own policies. However, in the past Vance has said he “certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally.” He has also hinted he was not opposed to nationwide restrictions like the 15-week ban Trump indicated support for, saying in 2022 “you can have some minimum national standards, which is my view, while also allowing the states to make up their minds,” NBC News reported. Big Number 63%. That’s the percentage of Americans who think abortion should be legal in all or most cases, according to Pew Research Center. Democrats and independents who lean left are more likely to think abortion should be legal, with 85% saying so, compared to the 41% of Republicans and independents who lean toward the Republican Party who say abortion should be legal.
