Trump allies have pushed for a special legislative session intended for the Republican-controlled Legislature to change Nebraska’s system to winner-take-all instead of awarding electoral votes by congressional district. “After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change,” state Sen. Mike McDonnell wrote in a letter obtained by NBC News. GOP state Sen. Loren Lippincott, who sponsored the bill to move to winner-take-all, indicated Monday that McDonnell’s position means a special session to move the legislation isn’t expected this fall. In response to questions about McDonnell’s statement, Lippincott emailed a draft of his weekly op-ed in local newspapers, which reads: “Governor [Jim] Pillen did not want to call a special session unless he had assurances from 33 senators they would vote yes on the bill. That effort did not bear fruit. There will be no special session to address Winner Take All. I will be carrying this bill, again, next legislative session.” Lippincott clarified by email that he hasn’t heard directly from Pillen but that he expects him to weigh in later this week. “The time is clicking, and I don’t see a road forward for this, just based on what the governor said,” said state Sen. Merv Riepe, a Republican who discussed the effort with Trump and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., last week. Riepe told NBC News he initially had concerns himself about changing the law so close to the election but said he wouldn’t stand in the way of fellow Republicans’ making the change. Riepe said Nebraska’s Electoral College system was initially changed in 1992 in hope of having more media exposure and money spent on presidential races in Omaha. “I’ve heard some senators say, ‘Well, let’s just wait and do it next year,’” he said. “And you’re kind of like, ‘Are you nuts?’ It will mean nothing, because then you’re talking about waiting until ’28. So it’s fundamentally get it done now or don’t worry about it so much.” McDonnell represents an Omaha-area state Senate district and is reportedly weighing a run for mayor of Omaha. A former Democrat, he switched parties in April, becoming a Republican, after state Democrats censured him. Trump slammed McDonnell on Truth Social. “It would have been better, and far less expensive, for everyone!” Trump wrote in part of his post. “Unfortunately, a Democrat turned Republican(?) State Senator named Mike McDonnell decided, for no reason whatsoever, to get in the way of a great Republican, common sense, victory. Just another ‘Grandstander!’” The developments appear to cap months of deliberations over whether Nebraska lawmakers could change how the state apportions its electoral votes in a way that would benefit Trump. Nebraska allocates its electoral votes by congressional district, and the swing district around Omaha has twice gone to Democrats in recent years, giving them one electoral vote from an otherwise ruby-red state. But if lawmakers changed to a winner-take-all model, Trump would be all but certain to win all of Nebraska’s electoral votes. And there’s a plausible scenario in which that could determine who becomes the next president. For example, if Vice President Kamala Harris were to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but lose every other swing state, she and Trump would be tied at 269 electoral votes under a winner-take-all setup in Nebraska with Trump winning the state. In that scenario, the race would be thrown to the U.S. House, where each state delegation would get one vote for president. Republicans hold a majority of delegations and are favored to retain it, even though the House majority could change hands after the November election. However, if Nebraska didn’t change its apportionment mode and if Harris were to win Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin but lose every other swing state, she would win the presidential election with 270 electoral votes. Nebraska Democrats lauded McDonnell’s announcement. “Nebraska has a long and proud tradition of independence, and our electoral system reflects that by ensuring that the outcome of our elections truly represents the will of the people without interference,” Nebraska Democratic Party chair Jane Kleeb said. “Senator McDonnell is standing strong against tremendous pressure from out-of-state interests to protect Nebraskans’ voice in our democracy. In this election and those to come, Nebraskans will continue to lead the way by electing leaders at every level who stand up for the people and respect our spirit of independence,” Kleeb added. Last week, Graham, a Trump ally, met with Pillen and about two dozen Republican legislators to discuss how the state allocates its electoral votes, according to a source with direct knowledge of the trip. Graham, acting on behalf of the Trump campaign, was working to encourage Pillen to call a special legislative session at which lawmakers could consider changing the state’s apportionment of electoral votes, the source said. Proponents of the winner-take-all model would need 33 votes in the state Senate to overcome a filibuster to move forward with the change. While the state’s unicameral Legislature is technically nonpartisan, Republicans do have a 33-seat majority thanks to McDonnell’s recent party flip. But that narrow margin means Republicans can’t move forward without him. Pillen has said he hasn’t yet “received the concrete and public indication that 33 senators would vote” for the winner-take-all system. State lawmakers told the Nebraska Examiner last week that they estimated that the change had the support of 30 or 31 state senators, meaning they remained two to three votes short. McDonnell had been one of them. Sen. Merv Riepe had been thought to be another. The Washington Post reported last week that Riepe now supports the change to a winner-take-all system. The newfound interest in Nebraska’s Electoral College votes comes months after Republicans tried, and failed, to make the change in the spring. Back then, a pressure campaign backed by Pillen, Trump and pro-Trump influencer Charlie Kirk fell short on procedural grounds, as it lacked support from enough senators to overcome a filibuster. Ever since the state changed how it allocated its Electoral College votes more than 30 years ago, lawmakers have repeatedly tried to change back to awarding all of Nebraska’s votes to the statewide winner. An effort to do so passed in 1995, but the governor vetoed it. Another effort fell just one vote short in 2016. Maine is the only other state that doesn’t have a winner-take-all system. But while Maine Democrats have discussed switching their system in response if Nebraska made a change, they appear to have run out of time to make a countermove for November.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nA Nebraska Republican state lawmaker said Monday that he remains opposed to&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Nebraska GOP leader against altering electoral vote system, thwarting Trump&#8217;s efforts first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/us/nebraska-gop-leader-against-altering-electoral-vote-system-thwarting-trumps-efforts/","image":"https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit_1500w/rockcms/2024-09/240923-Mike-McDonnell-Nebraska-se-105p-eb7c36.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 00:52:33","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.246},{"id":257163526,"title":"Amid growing UK health care crisis, nearly 8 million patients are waiting for care, data shows","text":"Experts are warning of a growing health care crisis in England, as millions of U.K. residents are waiting for medical attention.

Then it was reported that she apologized saying she was “misinformed.” Now, Jackson is saying that apology was issued without authorization. Last week, The Guardian reported that Jackson dismissed claims that Vice President Harris is black because Harris was born to an Indian woman. “Well, you know what they supposedly said? She’s not Black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian,” the Rythm Nation singer said, according to the paper. The paper’s reporter corrected the singer by noting that Harris is both black and Indian, but Jackson pushed back against that, too, by saying the vice president’s father was white. “Her father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days,” she said. “I was told that they discovered her father was white.” Kamala Harris was born in Oakland, California, to mother Shyamala Gopalan, who was a cancer researcher from India. Her father, Donald Harris, is native of Jamaica and was an economist who immigrated to the U.S. to earn a doctorate degree at the University of California, Berkeley, where he met Kamala’s mother. Once Jackson’s words got into print, though, Mo Elmasri apologized for her comments in a statement on Sunday in a report at Buzzfeed. Elmasri told Buzzfeed he was Jackson’s manager. “Janet apologizes for any confusion caused and acknowledges the importance of accurate representation in public discourse” Elmasri said. “We appreciate the opportunity to address this and will remain committed to promoting unity … She deeply respects Vice President Kamala Harris and her accomplishments as a Black and Indian woman.” But now Jackson’s team is disavowing Mo Elmasri’s statement. Indeed, there seems to be confusion over Elmasri’s actual role with Jackson. According to sources, her brother, Randy Jackson, is actually Janet’s manager. And now the Jackson team is insisting that Elmasri had no right or authorization to issue any apologies, according to USA Today.","summary":"Internewscast Journal\n\nInternewscast\n\n\nPop star Janet Jackson was blasted by left-wing critics last week for&#8230;\n\n\nThis Post: Janet Jackson Rejects Fake Apology Claiming Kamala Harris Isn&#8217;t Black first appeared on Internewscast Journal","url":"https://internewscast.com/news/janet-jackson-rejects-fake-apology-claiming-kamala-harris-isnt-black/","image":"https://internewscast.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ic_launcher.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 00:31:21","author":"Internewscast","authors":["Internewscast"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.312},{"id":257163978,"title":"Harris gains ground with economy-focused voters, CBS News poll finds","text":"Harris gains ground with economy-focused voters, CBS News poll finds The latest CBS News polling shows Vice President Kamala Harris making up some ground regarding what most voters consistently say is the biggest issue this election: the economy.

All rights reserved The schedule makers anticipated there would be a good chance the penultimate series of the season between the New York Yankees and Baltimore Orioles would hold significant ramifications for a pair of contending teams. Technically it does but not for the reasons of two teams vying for the AL East title. It seemed headed in that direction as recently as three weeks ago, but the Yankees are displaying a more business like approach to a surge enabling them to open a six-game lead over the Orioles. For the most part an improved quality of play and some key decisions are helping the Yankees move to the verge of securing the AL East and homefield advantage in the AL along with possibly the best record in baseball. While the Mets are going about with a more fun and quirky kind of vibe that makes their season feel like a long strange trip, the Yankees are in the midst of a business like 12-4 surge, something evidenced in the matter of fact comment by Aaron Boone on Sunday after a 5-1 West Coast trip ended with a 7-4 win in Oakland. “I think everyone in that room knows what’s at stake and what the mission is and where we’re at on the calendar and the opportunity in front of us,” Boone told reporters after the Yankees played their final game in Oakland. “So I think guys are ready to just do what we’ve got to do to win ballgames and give ourselves a chance come October. As for homefield advantage being the holy grail its importance exists but once the division gets clinched there are other matters for the Yankees to attend to. “We’d love to get it,” Boone told reporters. “We’re going to be playing these games to win. Again, hopefully we do clinch and hopefully we win this division first and foremost. Certainly we understand it’s (best record) there to be had. Would want that, but you’re always striking the balance between that and making sure guys are in a good spot.” MORE FOR YOU Apple’s New iPhone 16 Pro Delivers Delight And Disappointment New Galaxy S25 Ultra Exclusive Teases Samsung’s Ambitious Plans Janet Jackson Dismisses ‘Unauthorized’ Apology After Saying Kamala Harris Is Not Black—Here’s What To Know New York Yankees' Aaron Judge runs to first base after hitting during the fifth inning of a baseball ...

All rights reserved Whether the Yankees wind up with the best record is another story but in some ways this stretch is better than the 45-19 and 50-22 record the Yankees sprinted out to without Gerrit Cole. In the past two weeks and beyond, the Yankees have seemingly found their leadoff hitter in Gleyber Torres, seemingly realized Austin Wells can handle every day catching duties and hitting cleanup. Additionally the Yankees seemingly realized this is a good time for Jasson Dominguez to get regular playing time in left field over Alex Verdugo, who may still be valuable as a bench piece. And perhaps more importantly the Yankees realized deploying a closer with double-digit blown saves is not necessarily the most prudent approach. Since Clay Holmes allowed the game-ending grand slam to Wyatt Langford on Sept. 3, the Yankees are 9-2 in games decided by three runs or less. Luke Weaver, who was getting late season starts a year ago at this time as the Yankees were eliminated from the postseason, seemingly has seized the closer role with four saves. As a result of Weaver grabbing the closer role effectively, the Yankee bullpen has improved to the point where its 3.60 ERA is fourth in the majors. The improvement includes a relief corps with a 1.30 ERA in its past 16 games. At the same time as the Yankees surging towards the division title, the Orioles are stumbling, losing four wins in 10 games and some of the lower quality aspects the Yankees showed are appearing in recent games for the Orioles, whose inability to overcome injuries to pitching are notable as a reason for keeping them from repeating as a division winner.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass) Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. The Orioles are enduring a 28-32 second half with five straight series losses and other than three days in early September, haven’t held the division lead with any kind of regularity since Aug. 20, meaning they are just trying to do enough to clinch the top wild card and figure out who their opponent is in the wild-card round with a potential Division Series against the Yankees looming. During this month, the Orioles are hitting .226 and .239 since the All-Star break. While Yankee pitching often can compensate for hitting struggles, Baltimore is producing a 4.31 ERA since the break, a number that would be higher if not for the respectable 3.72 ERA this month. “We just have to focus on what is going on in here, in this clubhouse,” third baseman Jordan Westburg told reporters after a one-run loss to the Detroit Tigers. “And nothing about what is going outside, what people are saying. What could or couldn’t happen. We just have to stay tight in here. Really focus on the chemistry this last stretch and play good baseball. And we’ll see what happens.” What appears to be happening is a division title for the Yankees and a wild-card spot for the Orioles, something that could become official in the upcoming days.

Al Sharpton were among those who paid tribute during funeral services Monday for New Orleans civil rights activist Sybil Morial. Morial, who was also the widow of New Orleans’ first Black mayor, Ernest N. “Dutch” Morial, and mother to former Mayor Marc H. Morial, died earlier this month at age 91. New Orleans news outlets reported that Biden paid her respects in a video played for attendees at the service held at Xavier University, where Morial attended school and worked for 28 years. Young, the one-time United Nations ambassador and former Atlanta mayor who was a friend of Morial's since their childhood, also spoke: “There's something magical, and spiritual, about the life of Sybil Morial that will never die,” Young told the mourners. Sharpton, leader of the National Action Network, said Morial's activism made them all better. “What Sybil Morial has done goes beyond her family, goes beyond her husband and goes beyond her children and grandchildren,\" he said. “All of us are better because she decided to join the struggle to make the country better racially and gender-wise.” Sharpton also read condolences from Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, who said Morial broke down barriers for all and lived a life of impact that will be inspirational for generations. “Mrs. Morial will be remembered for the light she brought to this world,” Harris wrote. Former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, sent condolences as well, describing Morial as “an extraordinary woman.” Morial was born Nov. 26, 1932, and raised by her physician father and schoolteacher mother in a deeply segregated New Orleans. She attended Xavier University of Louisiana, one of the city’s historically Black higher learning institutions, before transferring to Boston University, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was pursuing a divinity degree and guest-preaching at churches. She met King there and returned home, inspired to do her part in the Civil Rights Movement. She founded the Louisiana League of Good Government, which helped Black people register to vote at a time when they still had to pass tests such as memorizing the Preamble to the Constitution. She also was a plaintiff in a lawsuit challenging a Louisiana law that barred public school teachers from being involved in groups fighting segregation, according to the LSU Women’s Center. During reflections by her children, Marc Morial, who now leads the National Urban League, said the city had “lost its matriarch.” “She is one of the last living personalities from that magic era of the 50s and 60s who opened doors so that we could walk through them,” he said. He said he believed he and his siblings inherited many of his mother’s traits. His brother, Jacques, and sister, Julie, got their high IQ from her, while his sister Cherie acquired their mother’s ease at making friends and his other sister, Monique, manifested her drill sergeant enforcement persona, he said. As for himself, he said, he received her multitasking ability. “She could cook, talk to you on the phone, help us with homework and every hair would still be in place. She was masterful in carrying out many things at one time,” he said. In his final reflection, he told St. Peter, one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus, to get ready. “Open the gates! Sound the trumpet! Roll out the red carpet! Our queen is coming your way!” he said, drawing a round of applause.","summary":"First Lady Jill Biden, former ambassador Andrew Young and the Rev.

To understand why requires getting a bit deep in the Electoral College weeds. Almost all states use a winner-take-all system to apportion their presidential electors, but Nebraska and Maine award some electors by congressional district. In 2020, Joe Biden won one of Nebraska’s five electoral votes, and Donald Trump won one elector from rural Maine. This year Kamala Harris’s clearest path to victory is to take the so-called blue wall states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, plus one electoral vote in Nebraska. One reason that both states have resisted partisan pressure to switch to winner-take-all is the assumption that if one did so, the other would as well, balancing out any Electoral College effect. But this year, Republicans waited until it was too late for Maine to change its rules before starting a push to change them in Nebraska. If they succeeded and Harris held the blue wall but lost the other swing states, there would be a tie in the Electoral College. For the first time in 200 years, the election would go to the House, where each state delegation would get one vote and Trump would almost certainly be installed as president. So far, one man, State Senator Mike McDonnell, who defected from the Democratic Party this spring, is standing in the Republican Party’s way. We should all be grateful for his courage. But the pressure on him from his new party will be intense, and he can still change his mind in the coming weeks.","summary":"Can we fix the Constitution before it destroys us?","url":"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/23/opinion/electoral-college-presidential-election.html","image":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2024/09/23/multimedia/23goldberg1-bwmj/23goldberg1-bwmj-facebookJumbo.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 00:05:06","author":"Michelle Goldberg","authors":["Michelle Goldberg"],"language":"en","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.131},{"id":257163448,"title":"Kamala Harris Should Reconsider Her Snub of Historic Catholic Event","text":"“A campaign can require a lot of wardrobe change,” a tuxedoed Mitt Romney remarked at the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in 2012. “Blue jeans in the morning perhaps, suits for a lunch fundraiser, sport coat for dinner. But it's nice to finally relax and to wear what Ann and I wear around the house,” the 2012 Republican presidential nominee quipped. The audience, composed of leaders in business, media and politics, roared in laughter — Romney had been pilloried by his opponent, President Barack Obama, as a callous corporatist throughout the grueling campaign. But with this self-deprecating joke, Romney momentarily lifted the window on American politics for some much-needed fresh air while humanizing himself in the process. It was a classic Al Smith dinner moment, one of many from the decades-long tradition of presidential nominees coming together to raise money for needy children in the Archdiocese of New York. At the event, held every third Thursday of October in presidential election years for nearly the past 80 years, the bitterest political foes have donned their finery and traded good-natured barbs for a good cause. It is a quintessentially Catholic event that reminds us of the importance of having a good sense of humor and harks back to a time when grace, wit, the ability to laugh at oneself and civility toward one's opponent were not so rare in politics. So, it was unfortunate to learn that Vice President Kamala Harris has declined an invitation to the event, opting instead to spend time on the campaign trail. That’s a shame. Her absence will be only the second by a presidential nominee in the dinner’s history. Walter Mondale declined his invitation in 1984. To be sure, presidential campaigns are always a brutal and unforgiving enterprise. But the 2024 race, which has seen one nominee survive two assassination attempts and another forced to drop out from the race due to declining cognition, has been unusually grim. If ever a presidential campaign needed an evening of levity, it is this one. Harris’ absence from the dinner, from which a bevy of diverting highlights inevitably emerge, is a missed opportunity for the candidate as much as it is a loss for the country, which could use a dose of good, old-fashioned political humor and civility. Since taking over the top of the Democratic ticket, Harris has campaigned on the theme of “joy” — an evening of laughter and goodwill would seem to be an ideal opportunity to show herself as the “happy warrior” she purports to be. Obviously, Harris’ radical pro-abortion stance puts her sharply at odds with the Church’s unwavering defense of the right to life. There are points of real tension with Trump, as well. The Archdiocese of New York invited both candidates despite those differences, out of respect for our electoral process and the office they seek. On Monday morning, Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York expressed disappointment at Harris’ decision, saying he had looked forward to “giving the vice president an enthusiastic welcome.” He then wryly noted that Walter Mondale, who declined the dinner’s invitation, lost 49 of 50 states. Harris rightly earned plaudits for walking across the stage and shaking Trump’s hand before the presidential debate in Philadelphia early this month. In the same spirit, we join Cardinal Dolan in hoping she and her staff reconsider and give the country a break from political rancor — for one night, at least.","summary":"commentary","url":"https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/editorial-kamala-harris-al-smith-dinner","image":"https://publisher-ncreg.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/pb-ncregister/swp/hv9hms/media/20240923180924_6cd7ea3403046caa61ae5d83aea3978cc046a54461a233e828e1904dde015e22.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-24 00:04:37","author":"The Editors","authors":["The Editors"],"language":"en","source_country":"US","sentiment":0.277},{"id":257162318,"title":"Trump threatens John Deere with tariff hike if it outsources production to Mexico","text":"Trump threatens John Deere with tariff hike if it outsources production to Mexico Former President Donald Trump mentioned a new policy proposal that could cost an iconic American company big money, just as CBS polls show Vice President Kamala Harris making some gains on the economy in the neck-and-neck presidential race.

Email tips@dailymail.com By Amelia Wynne For Mailonline Published:00:51 BST, 24 September 2024 |Updated:01:40 BST, 24 September 2024 e-mail View comments Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver has revealed she had an abortion age 17 after getting pregnant by a 35-year-old man. The Eileen Grimshaw actress, 61, recalled her 'tragic teens' in a new interview ahead of the publication of her memoir A Work in Progress. She told how she became promiscuous and had one night stands when she was growing up as she looked for love and validation 'in all the wrong places'. After losing her virginity to an older boy she ran off with a sailor at just 16 before leaving him for his older brother and soon after getting pregnant at 17 with a 35-year-old man. She told The Mirror: 'I looked for love and validation and acceptance in all the wrong places and my first sexual encounters were with somebody who was four or five years older than me. Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver has revealed she had an abortion age 17 after getting pregnant by a 35-year-old man The Eileen Grimshaw actress, 61, recalled her 'tragic teens' in a new interview ahead of the publication of her memoir A Work in Progress 'There were boyfriends, one-night stands. I convinced myself that 'Oh, if I do this, they will love me'. I was always searching for a way to belong.' Of her pregnancy she added: 'Again, that was somebody who was way older than me and took advantage. Now it's appalling to think of myself at that young age in that situation with men who should know better.' She chose to have an abortion and was supported by her mother, saying now as she looks back that she wants to go back in time and give her teenage self a 'big hug'. Later in life at 26, Sue married actor James Quinn and the couple had son Elliott, now 28. However they divorced and she is now happily married to second husband, lighting technician Brian Owen. It comes after earlier this year Sue revealed she felt 'shamed and judged' before losing three stone. She has been displaying a slimmer frame of late as a result of being 'seriously ill' last year as well as giving up alcohol. Appearing as a guest panellist on Loose Women, the soap star revealed she has been treated differently while at different weights. She told how she became promiscuous and had one night stands when she was growing up as she looked for love and validation 'in all the wrong places' After losing her virginity to an older boy she ran off with a sailor at just 16 before leaving him for his older brother and soon after getting pregnant at 17 with a 35-year-old man She told The Mirror : 'I looked for love and validation and acceptance in all the wrong places and my first sexual encounters were with somebody who was four or five years older than me' She explained: 'My weight has been up down all over the place and most of it was helped by red wine. 'At the minute I am a lot thinner but I've been ill this year and for some reason my metabolism seems to have changed and because I'm not drinking. But I have been the other way and I might go back the other way.' Sue continued: 'What I hate about it is the shame that is attached to being a bigger person. The judgments made, quite often from other women. 'I find it really hard to take We're not stupid, we know we're big, we know we have a problem, we know we have an addiction, don't treat us like we are idiots. Read More Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver, 60, says she's 'come out from hiding away' after her incredible three-stone weight loss: 'I decided this decade is for me' 'Other women are shocking at it. It's so in us. Examples are when I've lost weight I go into a room and someone goes 'oh my god, you look amazing, you've lost weight' all I will hear is 'you looked like an absolute dog when you were big'. 'It's how we talk about it that makes a big difference.' Sue recently opened up on her weight loss, explaining it was part of a lifestyle overhaul. She admitted she 'over-did red wine' during the pandemic and pilled on the pounds, which inspired her to give it up. Despite her Corrie character Eileen Grimshaw spending a lot of time in The Rovers, she admitted that pubs are her 'idea of hell.' Speaking Kaye Adams on her How to be 60 podcast, in quotes obtained by The Sun, Sue explained: 'In the pandemic we all over-did things. I spent a lot of it drinking lots of lovely red wine and I put on a lot of weight doing it. 'Then I did dry January and I thought. 'I wonder what life would be like if I stopped completely?'' The actress added her husband Brian, shares different views and 'love pub culture.' 'It was my idea of hell when I drank and especially now that I don't drink,' she said. Last year, Sue insisted she's 'not obsessed over diets' as she reflected on the unfair expectations placed on women while covering the March issue of Prima magazine. She is seen on the iconic soap in 2001 She declared she would never promote any weight-related products as women have 'enough difficulties as it is'. On not being embroiled in diet culture Sue told the publication: 'I lost some weight in the jungle, but I'm not obsessing over diets: life is hard enough! 'There's always going to be outside pressure and unfair expectations placed on women, but I refuse to get pulled into it. 'That's why I'll never promote anything weight-related, and it's why I'd always rather compliment somebody on their smile or their outfit, rather than their weight.' She continued: 'Let's just let women be women – we have enough difficulties and struggles as it is.'

Email tips@dailymail.com By Amelia Wynne For Mailonline Published:00:51 BST, 24 September 2024 |Updated:01:03 BST, 24 September 2024 e-mail View comments Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver has revealed she had an abortion age 17 after getting pregnant by a 35-year-old man. The Eileen Grimshaw actress, 61, recalled her 'tragic teens' in a new interview ahead of the publication of her memoir A Work in Progress. She told how she became promiscuous and had one night stands when she was growing up as she looked for love and validation 'in all the wrong places'. After losing her virginity to an older boy she ran off with a sailor at just 16 before leaving him for his older brother and soon after getting pregnant at 17 with a 35-year-old man. She told The Mirror: 'I looked for love and validation and acceptance in all the wrong places and my first sexual encounters were with somebody who was four or five years older than me. Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver has revealed she had an abortion age 17 after getting pregnant by a 35-year-old man The Eileen Grimshaw actress, 61, recalled her 'tragic teens' in a new interview ahead of the publication of her memoir A Work in Progress 'There were boyfriends, one-night stands. I convinced myself that 'Oh, if I do this, they will love me'. I was always searching for a way to belong.' Of her pregnancy she added: 'Again, that was somebody who was way older than me and took advantage. Now it's appalling to think of myself at that young age in that situation with men who should know better.' She chose to have an abortion and was supported by her mother, saying now as she looks back that she wants to go back in time and give her teenage self a 'big hug'. Later in life at 26, Sue married actor James Quinn and the couple had son Elliott, now 28. However they divorced and she is now happily married to second husband, lighting technician Brian Owen. It comes after earlier this year Sue revealed she felt 'shamed and judged' before losing three stone. She has been displaying a slimmer frame of late as a result of being 'seriously ill' last year as well as giving up alcohol. Appearing as a guest panellist on Loose Women, the soap star revealed she has been treated differently while at different weights. She told how she became promiscuous and had one night stands when she was growing up as she looked for love and validation 'in all the wrong places' After losing her virginity to an older boy she ran off with a sailor at just 16 before leaving him for his older brother and soon after getting pregnant at 17 with a 35-year-old man She told The Mirror : 'I looked for love and validation and acceptance in all the wrong places and my first sexual encounters were with somebody who was four or five years older than me' She explained: 'My weight has been up down all over the place and most of it was helped by red wine. 'At the minute I am a lot thinner but I've been ill this year and for some reason my metabolism seems to have changed and because I'm not drinking. But I have been the other way and I might go back the other way.' Sue continued: 'What I hate about it is the shame that is attached to being a bigger person. The judgments made, quite often from other women. 'I find it really hard to take We're not stupid, we know we're big, we know we have a problem, we know we have an addiction, don't treat us like we are idiots. Read More Coronation Street star Sue Cleaver, 60, says she's 'come out from hiding away' after her incredible three-stone weight loss: 'I decided this decade is for me' 'Other women are shocking at it. It's so in us. Examples are when I've lost weight I go into a room and someone goes 'oh my god, you look amazing, you've lost weight' all I will hear is 'you looked like an absolute dog when you were big'. 'It's how we talk about it that makes a big difference.' Sue recently opened up on her weight loss, explaining it was part of a lifestyle overhaul. She admitted she 'over-did red wine' during the pandemic and pilled on the pounds, which inspired her to give it up. Despite her Corrie character Eileen Grimshaw spending a lot of time in The Rovers, she admitted that pubs are her 'idea of hell.' Speaking Kaye Adams on her How to be 60 podcast, in quotes obtained by The Sun, Sue explained: 'In the pandemic we all over-did things. I spent a lot of it drinking lots of lovely red wine and I put on a lot of weight doing it. 'Then I did dry January and I thought. 'I wonder what life would be like if I stopped completely?'' The actress added her husband Brian, shares different views and 'love pub culture.' 'It was my idea of hell when I drank and especially now that I don't drink,' she said. Last year, Sue insisted she's 'not obsessed over diets' as she reflected on the unfair expectations placed on women while covering the March issue of Prima magazine. She is seen on the iconic soap in 2001 She declared she would never promote any weight-related products as women have 'enough difficulties as it is'. On not being embroiled in diet culture Sue told the publication: 'I lost some weight in the jungle, but I'm not obsessing over diets: life is hard enough! 'There's always going to be outside pressure and unfair expectations placed on women, but I refuse to get pulled into it. 'That's why I'll never promote anything weight-related, and it's why I'd always rather compliment somebody on their smile or their outfit, rather than their weight.' She continued: 'Let's just let women be women – we have enough difficulties and struggles as it is.'

(AP) — Donald Trump sat in a large barn in rural Pennsylvania on Monday, asking questions of farmers and offering jokes, but, in a rarity for his campaign events, mostly listening. The bombastic former president was unusually restrained at an event about China’s influence on the U.S. economy, a roundtable during which farmers and manufacturers expressed concerns about losing their way of life. Behind Trump were large green tractors and a sign declaring “Protect our food from China.” The event in Smithton, Pennsylvania, gave Trump a chance to drive his economic message against Vice President Kamala Harris, arguing that imposing tariffs and boosting energy production will lower costs. He highlighted Harris’ reversal of a previous vow to ban fracking, a method of producing natural gas key to Pennsylvania’s economy. And he noted the tractors behind him were manufactured by John Deere, which announced in June it was moving skid steer and track loader manufacturing to Mexico and working to acquire land there for a new factory. Trump threatened the firm with a 200% tariff should he win back the presidency and it opted to export manufacturing to Mexico. “If they want to build in the United States, there’s no tariff,” he added. Trump opened the event with some of his usual themes. He declared that in 2020, “We had an election that didn’t exactly work out too good. And it was a disgrace.” But he then did something unusual: He let others do most of the talking. When one farmer said recent decades had seen scores of family farms shut down, Trump asked what that meant for overall production. The response was that, thanks to larger farms now operating, total production is actually up but “we are losing the small family farms.” “I know that, yes,” Trump responded somberly. Later, he said, “I am not too worried about the people around this table” supporting him on Election Day, while jokingly adding, “But you never know.” In response to another participant’s concerns about energy production, Trump said he didn’t know that farmers were so energy-dependent. Another farmer talked about Chinese-subsidized businesses, prompting Trump to respond, “That’s why we need tariffs.” After the same farmer finished her comments by praising him profusely, he intoned, “Amen. I agree.” Trump has embraced tariffs as he tries to appeal to working-class voters who oppose free-trade deals and the outsourcing of factories and jobs, and the event wasn’t all about showing a more personable side. Later the former president took questions from reporters and got more customarily combative when asked whether he was concerned that tariffs on manufacturers like John Deere would increase costs for farmers. He said of Harris, “She is not going to be good for Pennsylvania.” Later Monday, Trump is holding a rally in Indiana, Pennsylvania, where he is hoping conservative, white working-class voters help him pull ahead of Harris. Stopping at a neighborhood market prior to the rally, Trump again displayed a softer side, buying a bag of popcorn and quipping to staff that if elected, he may send for more from the Oval Office. He also gave a woman paying for groceries a $100 bill, declaring that the total “just went down a hundred bucks.” Harris herself is visiting Pennsylvania on Wednesday. Attending a New York fundraiser on Monday, Harris’ running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, told a group of about 30 donors focused on climate change that Trump’s energy catchphrase of “drill baby, drill” is “not a solution to things, and the public knows that it’s a cheap, easy thing.” Walz, speaking at a midtown Manhattan hotel to an audience that included former presidential candidate Tom Steyer and Hollywood producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, called climate change an “existential threat” but also “an incredible opportunity to grow our economy.” He specifically cited farmers who use their land to generate wind energy in addition to growing crops. In response to Trump’s farming event, Harris campaign spokesman Joseph Costello said that “despite all his lies and pandering, Donald Trump used the White House to give handouts to wealthy corporations and foreign companies.” Costello said in a statement that those came “at the expense of family farmers, drive farm bankruptcies to record levels, and sacrifice small American farmers as pawns in his failed trade war with China.” Trump’s event in Smithton was hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, led by Richard Grenell, Trump’s former acting director of national intelligence, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin. Grenell said, “China is getting into our farmlands, and we have to be able to see China very clearly.” At the end of 2022, China held nearly 250,000 acres of U.S. land, which is slightly less than 1% of foreign-held acres, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. By comparison, Canada was the largest foreign owner of U.S. land, accounting for 32%, or 14.2 million acres. Still, the National Agricultural Law Center estimates that 24 states ban or limit foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from owning private farmland. The issue emerged after a Chinese billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a U.S. Air Force base in Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an Air Force base in North Dakota. Rex Murphy, from a nearby rural community who raises cattle and grows corn and hay, said farmers support Trump in this area, and said he wanted fewer taxes and “more freedom.” “I want him to do everything for the economy,” said Murphy, 48. “If he just becomes president, and he does what he does, he will do more.” __ Weissert reported from Washington.

During Monday’s episode of “The View,” co-host Whoopi Goldberg defended Janet Jackson’s false comments about Vice President Kamala Karris. In an interview with The Guardian published on Saturday, Jackson, 58, falsely said about Vice President Harris, “She’s not Black. That’s what I heard. That she’s Indian. [Harris’] father’s white. That’s what I was told. I mean, I haven’t watched the news in a few days. I was told that they discovered her father was white.” Goldberg asked critics to give the “Nasty” singer “a little grace.” But, not all of her fellow “The View” panelists agreed. Sunny Hostin said she “doesn’t want to give it this much air.” Alyssa Farah Griffin said about Jackson, “My guess is she’s not looking at great sources of media.” Co-host Ana Navarro commented that Jackson was “spreading misinformation” and that the pop star “has a phone,” meaning she can look up accurate information. “I think Janet Jackson, like every other American — whether you’re a celebrity or not — has a right to endorse, support or not support whomever they want,” Navarro added. “She’s got every right to not like Kamala Harris if she doesn’t want to. What she did was spread misinformation, and I think it’s very irresponsible when you have a platform the way Janet Jackson does to use that platform carelessly.” But, Goldberg cut in to disagree. “Hold on, hold on, yeah she’s got a phone – Janet Jackson is not a political animal. She’s a musician, her life is doing this, and she’s mourning her brother,” said Goldberg, referring to Tito Jackson’s recent death at age 70 of an apparent heart attack. Goldberg added, “Sometimes I’ve said stuff and I was wrong, but people want you to say something right away. But when people are coming at you saying, ‘hey, you’re dumb, you don’t know…’ you know, you don’t want to answer people and it is a pain in the butt, I have to tell you.” To make the story stranger a man named Mo Elmasri, claiming to Jackson’s manager, gave a statement to Buzzfeed that read: “She deeply respects Vice President Kamala Harris and her accomplishments as a Black and Indian woman. Janet apologizes for any confusion caused and acknowledges the importance of accurate representation in public discourse.” But, Jackson’s management told Variety that the statement didn’t come from a real Jackson rep who was authorized to speak for the superstar. “The View” co-host Sara Haines chimed in, saying, “The fastest-growing group in this country is multiracial individuals, not bi, multiracial individuals so asking people, ‘what are you?’” She added, “My biracial friends always struggled that they weren’t white enough or they weren’t Black enough and they were always left in the middle The middle is where the world is headed and so we need to be more open about people’s identities and what they identify as and have some grace.” The “Sister Act” actress continued to defend Jackson. “Sometimes people get it wrong, and they’re wrong,” said Goldberg. “They made a mistake, they were wrong, it happens [and] anybody who says it doesn’t happen to every one of us, multiracial or not, we all do it. So, a little grace for the girl, a little grace for the girl, alright?”","summary":"\"Sometimes people get it wrong, and they're wrong,” said Whoopi Goldberg.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/23/entertainment/whoopi-goldberg-defends-janet-jackson-over-kamala-harris-not-black-comment/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/90280276.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/n4ZFZ6EH-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:55:22","author":"Lauren Sarner","authors":["Lauren Sarner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.299},{"id":257163324,"title":"Biden administration designates UAE ‘major defence partner’ in rare move","text":"United States President Joe Biden has recognised the United Arab Emirates (UAE) as a “major defence partner”, deepening military ties despite friction over the war in Sudan and as deadly tensions ratchet in the Middle East. The announcement on Monday, which came following a White House meeting between Biden and UAE President Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, makes the UAE only the second country to receive the designation. The Biden administration gave India the designation in 2021. In a statement, the White House said the designation would “further enhance defense cooperation and security in the Middle East, East Africa, and the Indian Ocean regions”. It added that it would also “allow for unprecedented cooperation through joint training, exercises, and military-to-military collaboration, between the military forces of the United States, the UAE, and India, as well as other common military partners, in furtherance of regional stability”. The meeting came as Israel stepped up its attacks on Lebanon. At least 492 people, including 35 children, were killed on Monday in Israeli attacks on the territory which it said were targeting Hezbollah military infrastructure. “My team is in constant contact with their counterparts, and we’re working to de-escalate in a way that allows people to return to their home safely,” Biden told reporters during a photo opportunity in the Oval Office. A US State Department official, speaking to reporters on background on Monday, also said that US officials would be discussing “concrete ideas” for an “off-ramp” on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this week. Washington has been regularly criticised for avoiding using its leverage – including the billions in military aid it provides to Israel – to calm tensions in the region. On Gaza, the two leaders “underscored their commitment to continue working together towards ending the conflict” and the need for UN humanitarian aid to be allowed into the enclave, the White House said. To date, at least 41,431 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza amid a nearly yearlong Israeli offensive. The UAE has been a leading voice in the UN Security Council, putting forward resolutions condemning Israel’s war on Gaza, often putting it at odds with the veto-carrying US. Still, Washington has long viewed the Gulf country as integral to any post-war recovery plans in Gaza. The White House said Biden and Al Nahyan discussed “a path to stabilisation and recovery that responds to the humanitarian crisis, establishes law and order, and lays the groundwork for responsible governance” as well as their “commitment to the two-state solution” for Israel and Palestine. Conflict in Sudan The designation on Monday comes despite friction over the UAE’s alleged role in the war in Sudan. The UAE has been accused of channelling weapons to Rapid Support Forces (RSF), which have been locked in a bloody civil war with the Sudanese army since April last year. Both sides have been accused of abuses in the fighting, which has internally displaced more than 10.7 million people and forced a further 2.3 million to flee the country, according to the UN. Ahead of the White House meeting, five US lawmakers sent a letter to Biden calling on him to use Washington’s leverage to seek a change of course. The White House statement said the leaders had discussed the conflict and “stressed that there can be no military solution to the conflict in Sudan”. They also “underscored that all parties to the conflict must comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law”, it added. In a separate meeting with the UAE president, US Vice President and presidential candidate Kamala Harris “raised her deep concerns about the conflict in Sudan”, the White House said. “She expressed alarm at the millions of individuals who have been displaced by the war and the atrocities committed by the belligerents against the civilian population,” the statement said.","summary":"US-UAE boost military cooperation as Middle East tensions over war in Gaza surge and despite friction over Sudan war.","url":"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/9/23/biden-administration-designates-uae-major-defence-partner-in-rare-move?traffic_source=rss","image":"https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/AP24267626767508-1727132480.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:54:50","author":"Al Jazeera,Apps Support","authors":["Al Jazeera","Apps Support"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"qa","sentiment":0.051},{"id":257161772,"title":"Trump says he’d demand China’s Xi Jinping follow through on $50B farming deal if re-elected","text":"SMITHTON, Pa. — Former President Donald Trump said Monday his first call in the Oval Office would be to Xi Jinping, demanding the Chinese leader buckle down on a previously struck $50 billion agriculture deal. “My first call — I’m going to call up President Xi.

You’d buy $50 billion worth of American farm product,’ and I guarantee you he will buy it, 100% he will buy it,” Trump added. The former president struck a deal with China in his first term in tariff negotiations between the US and Beijing, which he said included an agreement for Xi to buy $50 billion worth of American agricultural goods. Now, Trump said, China is “not living up to it.” Trump also blasted the Harris-Biden administration for how they’ve handled relations with China during their term and said he would also tell Xi to crack down on fentanyl pouring out of China and across the US-Mexico border. “Second thing I’m going to do is I’m going to say, ‘you have to give the death penalty to your fentanyl dealers who are sending fentanyl,’” Trump went on.

The words aren’t only his, though — they’re also the slogans and cliches of Trump’s Democratic opponents, virtually verbatim. Ryan Routh left a letter with a friend, months ago, to apologize in case his assassination attempt failed. What’s been released so far makes Routh’s political motives clear — he saw Trump as dangerously unfit for the presidency and a threat to peace. Routh was especially incensed Trump terminated Barack Obama’s deal with Iran: Trump, he wrote, “Ended relations with Iran like a child and now the Middle East has unraveled.” America’s president, according to the would-be killer, “must at bare minimum embody the moral fabric that is America and be kind, caring, and selfless and always stand for humanity.” If this all sounds familiar, it’s because Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Trump’s legion of Democratic and ex-Republican detractors have supplied the premises for stopping the former president by any means possible. After all, if democracy really is at stake in November, voters themselves must be suicidal even to consider voting for Trump. To save democracy in such an emergency might well seem to call for extreme measures of a sort that no politician would dare endorse — but that a true believer might be prepared to hazard. Harris, Biden, and other Democratic leaders are quick to lament political violence; they have a responsibility to do more, however, by acknowledging that whatever their differences with Trump, his election does not mean the end of constitutional government. President Trump was not a tyrant, he isn’t poised to become one if re-elected — and, most importantly, killing him is nothing like justifiable tyrannicide. If Democrats could bring themselves to say this, they would do wonders for the emotional health of some of their own supporters — and might just save lives, including but not only Trump’s. The chilling thing about Routh’s letter is that it’s not a mindless, stream-of-consciousness rant: it’s an assassin’s manifesto written in the bland language of ordinary anti-Trump discourse. Like Routh in his letter, in the 2020 presidential campaign Joe Biden and New York Democratic Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand both described Trump as a menace to America’s “moral fabric.” “One of the worst things about President Trump . . . is he’s torn apart the moral fabric of who we are,” Gillibrand said in one Democratic debate, while Biden accused Trump of shredding “America’s invisible moral fabric.” Routh’s “kind, caring, and selfless” description of a good president — one he presumably wouldn’t murder — sounds generic, yet closely tracks Kamala Harris’s endorsement of Biden four years ago as “kind and endlessly caring” and possessed of “selfless courage.” Those words are obviously not incitements to violence: they simply testify to how little original thinking was taking place in Routh’s head. In the empty space between his ears there was a great echo chamber, reverberating with whatever he heard from Democrats and the anti-Trump hype machine. Routh wasn’t just soaking up the syllables of anti-Trump rhetoric, he was internalizing a mindset that presents Trump as an enemy of humanity itself, not only immature but malevolent. Democrats have created an extraordinary climate of fear around Trump, and if they don’t weigh their words more carefully, more violence will follow from the likes of Ryan Routh.","summary":"The man who intended to murder Donald Trump has explained in his own words why he wanted to do it.

As the current state superintendent of public instruction, Tony Thurmond seeks your support in his bid to be governor of California. The findings noted in this article covered his tenure directing public education. Elevating obscurity to mask ongoing failures does not bode well for a gubernatorial candidate. Public education continued with a lack of accountability; Thurmond’s failure to promote significant movement toward accountability while leading public education should not be rewarded. With a ‘D’ grade in education, Thurmond’s calling lies elsewhere; that calling is not California’s next governor.

In response to the letter about how the “state isn’t helping PG&E customers” deal with the utility’s greed, the writer should know that it’s up to our governor to appoint California Public Utility Commission members who will act in the interests of California citizens and ratepayers. Instead, what we’ve gotten for many years are appointees with ties to the investor-owned utilities who give them whatever they ask for rather than properly regulate them as they are expected to do. This corruption has been going on for a long time and will likely continue as long as the utilities can pay big donations to campaigns and offer high-paying jobs as rewards to their government benefactors. Beth Weinberger Oakland GOP leaders are late with Trump denunciation Re: “111 former GOP officials are backing Harris, call Trump ‘unfit to serve’” (Page A3, Sept. 19). I find it very irritating that one month before the national election, 111 former GOP officials decided to go public and endorse Kamala Harris because they believe Donald Trump is unfit to serve. I am not saying they are wrong, but their timing is unacceptable. Where were they during the primaries when they could have impacted the selection of the GOP presidential candidate? If they had spoken up then, they may have engineered the selection of a worthwhile Republican candidate. The Democrats have stood up twice in the last two elections to sway the primaries. First when they were afraid that Bernie Sanders was sure to win the nomination and, in one Super Tuesday, selected Biden. This time around they ousted Joe Biden, who was seen as medically unfit and sure to lose to Trump. Now the Republican Party is a disaster and may never recover and we will move closer to socialism.

Nebraska state Sen. Mike McDonnell, a former Democrat from Omaha who switched his party to Republican this year, issued a statement Monday about his opposition to awarding that state’s five electoral votes as a winner-take-all, like 48 other states currently do. Maine and Nebraska are the only two states that give two electoral votes to the candidate who wins statewide and one to the winner in each congressional district. \"Elections should be an opportunity for all voters to be heard, no matter who they are, where they live, or what party they support,\" McDonnell’s statement read. \"For decades, Nebraska has tried to live up to that ideal by allocating our electoral college votes in a way that gives all Nebraskans an equal voice in choosing our President. For Omaha, the city I love and have called home for 58 years, it brings tremendous national attention, is impactful on our local economy and forces Presidential candidates to make their case to all Nebraskans, instead of just flying over and disregarding us.\" HOW A LONE NEBRASKA DISTRICT COULD DECIDE THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION The senator continued, saying over the past weeks, there had been conversations about whether to change how the electoral college could be allocated. While McDonnell said he respects the desire some of his colleagues have on the issue, he has taken time to listen to his constituents and national leaders on both sides of the issue. \"After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change,\" he wrote. \"I have notified Governor Pillen that I will not change my long-held position and will oppose any attempted changes to our electoral college system before the 2024 election.\" TEXAS GOV. GREG ABBOTT'S DEBATE ADVICE FOR TRUMP: ‘LET HARRIS SPEAK’ McDonnell also said he encouraged the governor, and will encourage his colleagues, to pass an amendment next year that gives the people of Nebraska the chance to decide on how the electoral college votes are allocated on the ballot. \"This November, Nebraskans will have the chance to elect candidates at every level who reflect their views, including on this issue,\" McDonnell wrote. \"That’s how it should be. Nebraska voters, not politicians of either party, should have the final say on how we pick a president.\" The senator’s decision means Republicans do not have the two-thirds majority they would need in Nebraska to pull off a change before the Nov. 5 election. TRUMP AND HARRIS ON COLLISION COURSE AS 2024 CAMPAIGN ENTERS FINAL STRETCH Nebraska is one of nine states that Republican candidates have carried in every presidential election since 1964. It also has not had a winner-take-all rule in place since 1991, and most times since then, Republican candidates have captured all of the state’s votes. But in 2020, President Biden captured the vote for the Second Congressional District in Omaha. Former President Obama did the same thing in 2008. In order to lock down the presidency, a candidate needs to win 270 of the 538 electoral votes. In one scenario, Democratic Presidential Candidate Vice President Kamala Harris would win the battlegrounds of Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while Trump wins the other four battleground states of North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada. In that case, Harris would collect 269 electoral votes to Trump’s 268 — which includes four from Nebraska. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP The Associated Press reported that in that scenario, a Trump victory in Nebraska’s 2nd Congressional District would create a tie of 269-269, throwing the final decision to the U.S. House of Representatives. At that point, each state would have one vote, a situation that would likely favor Trump. But, if Harris carried the district, she would be president. The Associated Press contributed to this report.","summary":"A key Nebraska lawmaker said Monday that he opposes any changes to how electoral votes are disbursed during an election, jeopardizing Republican plans to lock down votes.","url":"https://www.foxnews.com/politics/nebraska-gop-senator-opposes-electoral-college-change-may-have-helped-trump-win-re-election","image":"https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/09/931/523/Mike-McDonnell.jpg?ve=1&tl=1","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:29:40","author":"Greg Wehner","authors":["Greg Wehner"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.059},{"id":257160796,"title":"Trump to rally at site of 1st assassination attempt in Pennsylvania","text":"Trump to rally at site of 1st assassination attempt in Pennsylvania Sources say former President Donald Trump will hold a rally at the Butler Farm Show fairgrounds on Oct. 5, where a gunman shot at him and grazed his ear on July 13.

The high-level week of the 79th session of the UN General Assembly begins in New York with the participation of more than 130 heads of state and over 100 foreign ministers. For five days, they will discuss issues of conflict prevention and resolution, combating the effects of climate change, socio-economic development, and other global issues of our time. In the coming week, representatives of 193 UN member states, the Vatican and Palestine, which have observer status in the world body, as well as the European Union will take turns at the General Assembly podium. The UN Secretariat told TASS that 76 heads of state and 42 heads of government are expected to participate in the forum. Beginning of general debate The general debate of the 79th session of the General Assembly will begin with speeches by UN Secretary General Ant·nio Guterres and the chairman of the 79th session, Philemon Yang. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will be the first world leader to take the floor, honoring a long-standing tradition. The Brazilian president will be followed by US leader Joe Biden. US Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris does not plan to participate in the high-level week in New York. A total of 34 speakers are scheduled to speak on the first day of the debate. On the second day, 40 heads of state will speak. The Russian delegation at the high-level week is headed by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. He is scheduled to speak on September 28. The top Russian diplomat will also participate in a number of high-level multilateral meetings, including events within the CSTO, BRICS, G20, and the Group of Friends in Defense of the UN Charter. Shifting focus from Ukraine to Gaza While the conflict in Ukraine was the main topic of last year's general debate, this year's discussions are expected to focus more on Israel's military operation in the Gaza Strip, the rising Palestinian death toll, and the deteriorating situation on the Lebanon-Israel border. The General Assembly meetings, which will run from 9:00 a.m. local time (1:00 p.m. GMT) until the evening, will be accompanied by a number of events. According to the UN Secretariat, hundreds of meetings and bilateral meetings will be held at the world body's headquarters during the week. Many bilateral meetings, including Lavrov's, will take place on the sidelines of the General Assembly.","summary":"In the coming week, representatives of 193 UN member states, the Vatican and Palestine, which have observer status in the world body, as well as the European Union will take turns at the General Assembly podium","url":"https://tass.com/world/1846765","image":"https://tass.com/img/blocks/common/tass_logo_share_ru.png","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:28:42","author":"Tass","authors":["Tass"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"ru","sentiment":-0.026},{"id":257161122,"title":"Russia produced most AI content to sway presidential vote, US intelligence official says","text":"Russia has generated more AI content to influence the US presidential election than any other foreign power as part of its broader effort to boost Republican candidate Donald Trump over Democrat Kamala Harris, a US intelligence official said on Monday. The official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI), speaking on condition of anonymity, made the comment in a briefing to reporters on the alleged use of artificial intelligence (AI) by Russia and other countries to influence the November 5 vote. AI content produced by Moscow is “consistent with Russia’s broader efforts to boost the former president’s [Trump] candidacy and denigrate the vice-president [Harris] and the Democratic Party, including through conspiratorial narratives,” he said. China has been using AI content in an attempt to influence how it is perceived worldwide, but not to sway the outcome of the US election, the official said. “China is using AI in broader influence operations seeking to shape global views of China and amplify divisive US political issues,” the official said. “We are not yet seeing China use AI for any specific operations targeting US election outcomes.” The Russian embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Russia previously has denied interfering in the US election. Like other forms of artificial intelligence, generative AI learns from past data how to take actions. Using that training, it creates new content such as text, pictures and videos that appears to have been produced by humans. The ODNI official said Russia is generating more AI content to influence the November election than any other country, but did not provide a volume of that AI content. He said Russia was a much more sophisticated actor and had a better understanding of how US elections work and appropriate targets. Asked how Russia was disseminating AI content, the official pointed to a July 9 Justice Department announcement of the disruption of an alleged Moscow-backed operation that used AI-enhanced social media accounts to spread pro-Kremlin messages in the US and elsewhere. The official said “Russian influence actors” staged a widely reported video in which a woman claimed she was a victim of a hit-and-run car accident by Harris. The video, however, was staged rather than produced through AI, he said. Microsoft said last week its research showed that video was the work of a covert Russian disinformation operation. Iranian influence actors have used AI to help generate posts for social media and “write inauthentic news articles for websites that claim to be real news sites”, the official said. The content created by the Iranian actors is in English and Spanish. It has targeted American voters “across the political spectrum on polarising issues” such as Israel and the conflict in Gaza, and on the presidential candidates, the official said. The Iranian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

We’re Verböten!” proclaimed Narducy on stage Saturday in Chicago. “It’s lovely to see you all.

What do you really want?” asked experimental rocker Annie Clark in her guise as St. Vincent over 60 minutes on the Cabaret Metro stage which masterfully melded the ideas of music and imagery.

I love this city. I’ve been walking around here for the last two days.

Robinson, the lieutenant governor of North Carolina who is now the GOP’s gubernatorial nominee, suggested that the comments in which he apparently called himself a “black NAZI,” yearned for the restoration of slavery, and enjoyed reading Mein Kampf could have been artificially generated. “Look, I’m not going to get into the minutiae about how somebody manufactured these salacious tabloid lies,” Robinson told CNN’s Andrew Kaczynski, who broke the original story. “But I can tell you this: There’s been over $1 million spent on me through AI by a billionaire’s son who’s bound and determined to destroy me. The things that people can do with the internet now is incredible,” Robinson insisted. “But what I can tell you is this: Again, these are not my words.” Robinson’s claims of fakery—AI or otherwise—are extremely unlikely. As The Washington Post’s Philip Bump notes, the CNN report linking Robinson to the porn site known as “Nude Africa” was “robust,” exposing “a digital trail that would be all but impossible to create artificially.” And not everyone in the GOP is buying Robinson’s excuse. Much of his senior staff has resigned, and the Trump campaign is reportedly distancing itself from Robinson, although Donald Trump’s endorsement of Robinson still stands. But the existence of AI aids Robinson in his shoddy defense: Not only can the technology make fake stories believable, but its existence helps those who want to make true stories seem unbelievable. In this election, invoking AI is yet another tool for some Americans to alter facts so that they align with their desired reality. Trump, for example, falsely accused Kamala Harris of using AI to generate an image showing a large crowd at a rally. (Meanwhile, he himself has spread illusions online: He recently reposted a doctored photo of Harris with the accused sex offender Sean “Diddy” Combs—whose face is actually superimposed on the body of Montel Williams; Trump also shared a fake endorsement from Taylor Swift last month.) To be sure, many fake images of politicians—including Donald Trump—proliferate online, some of which use AI, but because this technology sows doubt about reality, it can also provide a convenient dodge for politicians confronted by uncomfortable facts. Insinuating that AI played a role is just one of the tactics that Robinson and his defenders are using. Others have argued that the allegations are a targeted political attack without identifying exactly how such supposed lies were created. The GOP’s candidate for North Carolina attorney general, Dan Bishop, called the CNN report “a meticulously timed and coordinated character assassination.” The North Carolina Republican Party released a statement hours after the report was published, citing Robinson’s denial and accused “the Left” of “trying to demonize him via personal attacks.” Others are using vague language to avoid taking a stand. Consider, for example, this tangled double negative from J. D. Vance when he was asked about Robinson’s denial: “I don’t not believe him; I don’t believe him—I just think you have to let these things play out sometimes in the court of public opinion.” Lindsey Graham also toed a careful line, although with clearer language. “The charges are beyond unnerving. If they’re true, he’s unfit to serve for office,” Graham said. But he seemed to leave the door open to the possibility that the story was false. “If they’re not true,” Graham said, “he has the best lawsuit in the history of the country, for libel.” Then there are those who simply don’t care about the allegations. At a Trump rally in North Carolina over the weekend, The New York Times found that while few in attendance believed the story—many blamed the untrustworthiness of the media, according to the Times—some would support Robinson even if the reports of his racist, anti-Semitic, transphobic, and obscene posts were real. “Bryan Faulcon, 39, of Wilmington, said he didn’t believe the allegations,” the Times reported, “but even if they were true, Mr. Robinson still had his vote. The calculation was simple, Mr. Faulcon said: policy over character.” Indeed, if these allegations mattered to voters, they would not have nominated Robinson in the first place, would they? This is, after all, someone who called the Holocaust “a bunch of hogwash,” referred to transgenderism and homosexuality as “filth,” and suggested this summer that “some folks need killing.” North Carolina’s GOP voters had ample evidence of who he was, and they chose him anyway. While some of the MAGA faithful have grabbed onto convenient manipulations of the evidence in front of them, these voters’ approach seems to be acceptance.

On Sunday, Sept. 22, the Paramore bandleader, 35, shared an Instagram Story where a user accused her of \"reading a script\" and asked if she was \"paid or blackmailed\" for taking aim at Trump on Friday, Sept. 20 at the Las Vegas music event. \"whoever you are, i typed out my speech and had a crew member hold it near the camera for me in case i got nervous bc what i had to say was important and i didn’t want to trip up in the moment. didn’t end up looking at it though… that’s because i prepared,\" Williams said of .

The first episode, entitled Sweden, will follow the pair's journey to Sweden as they visit one of the 'healthiest outdoorsy' place on earth. They quickly plunge straight into mastering the art of the Nordic mindset of ‘friluftsliv’, which consists in getting back to nature & embracing the great outdoors.

Promising plenty of surprises already in the first episode, the duo will also get on a arduous hike on a remote island, followed by some ice cold swimming across a lake for final reflections and some Swedish ‘fire water' around a fire pit. The following episode, Greece, investigate how to 'age gracefully, or less dis-gracefully' as they touch down on the Greek rocky Island of Ikaria - named the island of longevity. One in three Ikarians live well into their 90s, ten years more than most people in the UK and Paddy and Chris are on a mission to find out how. During the episode, they meet a typical Ikarian family while in the Highland Plateau, who embodies the simple way of life and are set to work earning their self-sufficiency stripes, with Chris milking goats and Paddy set to work putting up fences. As they whisk off to the southern side of the island, they go fishing with Stavros, a 75-year-old fisherman - who has no plans to ever retire. Chris and Paddy even enjoyed riding some waves as surfing is a great activity in the island. For the penultimate day, Paddy challenges himself with rock climbing - but Chris was not one to join him due to his fear of heights.

They travelled to one of the country’s top wellness resorts for a full body MOT to assess how well they’re ageing. Speaking about his experience on the show, Paddy said: 'We’ve really tried to tap into both the traditional and modern methods of ‘living well’ that is adopted by each of the countries we visit. From Swedish saunas, to milking goats, rock climbing, and even visiting a ‘Gentleman’s clinic’...you name it and we try it!' The TV favourite also added the Greek island of Ikaria was so far his favourite place as it allowed him to 'see people leave all the complications of modern day life and technology behind, and just getting out there and enjoying everything life has to offer. While praising his journey companion, Paddy said: 'I could mention many things about the enigma that is Chris Harris, but alongside all the laughs and banter, we genuinely learn a lot about ourselves and each other on this trip, which has been eye-opening. 'I have also learnt, however, that Chris has terrible taste in music and should never be given control of the car radio again!'

'I’ve learnt a lot about my own health during the trip, some of which really shocked me, so I’ll definitely be taking forward the advice I’ve been given.

The TV presenter, 51, and the professional racing driver, 49, will be delighting fans with their eagerly-anticipated travel series - kicking off on Sunday 29 September on BBC One and BBC iPlayer. Paddy and Chris: Road Tripping will be shown in three parts, and see the duo tackle everything from surfing to trying out rollercoasters, working out in the woods and testing cosmetics as they find out how Europeans make the most of their later years. The first episode, entitled Sweden, will follow the pair's journey to Sweden as they visit one of the 'healthiest outdoorsy' place on earth. They quickly plunge straight into mastering the art of the Nordic mindset of ‘friluftsliv’, which consists in getting back to nature & embracing the great outdoors. Paddy McGuinnes (L) and Chris Harris (R) have stripped naked to shoot some eye-popping sauna scenes and also received a bombshell health news as they appeared on their new BBC's Road Tripping The TV presenter, 51, and the professional racing driver, 49, will be delighting fans with their eagerly-anticipated travel series - set to begin on Sunday 29 September on BBC and BBC iPlayer Swedes swear by ‘friluftsliv’ to restore body confidence, calm stress levels, and ultimately improve mental health. Promising plenty of surprises already in the first episode, the duo will also get on a arduous hike on a remote island, followed by some ice cold swimming across a lake for final reflections and some Swedish ‘fire water' around a fire pit. The following episode, Greece, investigate how to 'age gracefully, or less dis-gracefully' as they touch down on the Greek rocky Island of Ikaria - named the island of longevity. One in three Ikarians live well into their 90s, ten years more than most people in the UK and Paddy and Chris are on a mission to find out how. During the episode, they meet a typical Ikarian family while in the Highland Plateau, who embodies the simple way of life and are set to work earning their self-sufficiency stripes, with Chris milking goats and Paddy set to work putting up fences. As they whisk off to the southern side of the island, they go fishing with Stavros, a 75-year-old fisherman - who has no plans to ever retire. Chris and Paddy even enjoyed riding some waves as surfing is a great activity in the island. For the penultimate day, Paddy challenges himself with rock climbing - but Chris was not one to join him due to his fear of heights. Paddy and Chris: Road Tripping will be shown in three parts, where they are will go from surfing to trying out rollercoasters, to working out in the woods and even testing cosmetics as they find out how Europeans make the most of their later years The first episode, entitled 'Sweeden', will follow the pair's journey to Sweden as they visit one of the 'healthiest outdoorsy' place on earth The following episode, 'Greece', investigate how to 'age gracefully, or less dis-gracefully' as they touch down on the Greek rocky Island of Ikaria - named the island of longevity On their final day, Chris and Paddy head to the hills on scooters and join one of the island’s famous village parties – a Panigiri. And for their third and final episode, Switzerland, the brave pair headed to explore its multi-million-pound wellness industry. They travelled to one of the country’s top wellness resorts for a full body MOT to assess how well they’re ageing. Speaking about his experience on the show, Paddy said: 'We’ve really tried to tap into both the traditional and modern methods of ‘living well’ that is adopted by each of the countries we visit. From Swedish saunas, to milking goats, rock climbing, and even visiting a ‘Gentleman’s clinic’...you name it and we try it!' The TV favourite also added the Greek island of Ikaria was so far his favourite place as it allowed him to 'see people leave all the complications of modern day life and technology behind, and just getting out there and enjoying everything life has to offer. While praising his journey companion, Paddy said: 'I could mention many things about the enigma that is Chris Harris, but alongside all the laughs and banter, we genuinely learn a lot about ourselves and each other on this trip, which has been eye-opening. 'I have also learnt, however, that Chris has terrible taste in music and should never be given control of the car radio again!' On their final day, Chris and Paddy head to the hills on scooters and join one of the island's famous village parties - a Panigiri 'We’ve really tried to tap into both the traditional and modern methods of ‘living well’ that is adopted by each of the countries we visit. From Swedish saunas, to milking goats, rock climbing, and even visiting a ‘Gentleman’s clinic’...you name it and we try it!,' said Paddy Chris added about the experience: 'I’ve learnt a lot about my own health during the trip, some of which really shocked me, so I’ll definitely be taking forward the advice I’ve been given' Meanwhile racing driver Chris described the experience as a 'deep-dive into the secrets of human longevity'. 'I’ve learnt a lot about my own health during the trip, some of which really shocked me, so I’ll definitely be taking forward the advice I’ve been given. 'I’ve also learnt that life is for living, so plan to do plenty of that as well!' Chris added.

It is utilizing text, images, audio, and video in the content the Russians have produced. “The IC is observing foreign actors, including Russia and Iran, use generative AI technology to boost their respective U.S. election efforts. … Our update today makes clear that this is now happening here. Foreign actors are using AI to more quickly and convincingly” produce that content, an ODNI official told reporters. The official said their use of AI is more like “an accelerant rather than a revolutionary tool,” adding that “information operations are the threat, and AI is an enabler, generative AI is how to improve and accelerate aspects of foreign influence operations. But thus far, the IC has not seen it revolutionize such operations.” The update also noted that Russia is still boosting former President Donald Trump and denigrating Vice President Kamala Harris. In one example of Russia’s influence attempts that was not AI generated, a Kremlin-aligned troll farm recently faked a video laundered through a website staged to look like a San Francisco media outlet that fabricated inaccurate claims about Harris’s involvement in a hit-and-run accident, Microsoft’s Threat Analysis Center revealed last week. The website was created only days earlier. Comparatively, Iran has used AI to write fake news articles for fake news websites it set up that pose as legitimate news outlets. These outlets, and corresponding social media posts, have targeted Americans across the political spectrum on polarizing issues including on presidential candidates. Iran’s election interference operations unrelated to AI include hacking the Trump campaign and then offering that information to both U.S. media outlets and the then-Biden campaign. “This malicious cyber activity is the latest example of Iran’s multipronged approach, as noted in the joint August statement, to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process,” the FBI said in its announcement. “As the lead for threat response, the FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible.” CLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER China, for its part, is not boosting either candidate ahead of the election, though it is using AI to stoke division among Americans by promoting divisive U.S. issues like abortion and immigration.

The rapper told Entertainment Tonight that he felt one day he would be arrested for his 'crazy parties.' His wild fetes - which are not to be confused with his lurid Freak Offs - were attended by stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker as well as Kim and Khloe Kardashian. 'You're gonna hear about my parties,' said the 54-year-old rap mogul as he referred to his star-studded bashes. 'They're gonna be shutting them down. They're gonna probably be arresting me, doing all types of crazy things just 'cause we wanna have a good time,' Combs added. There is an interview from 1999 that has come back to haunt Sean ' Diddy ' Combs. The rapper told Entertainment Tonight that he felt one day he would be arrested for his 'crazy parties.' Seen with Tommy Lee in 2007 at his Real White Party in the Hamptons Unforgivable Fragrance models pose at The Real White Party on September 2, 2007 at Combs' residence in East Hampton, New York Diddy said that he was judged by adding a 'different element' to his bashes. He argued, 'Whenever you bring up a different element into people's environment, things that broaden people's horizons, people get intimidated. It's a lot of people out there that feel intimidated by it.' Diddy has been charged with sex trafficking and related crimes and will likely spend about 10 years behind bars. The ex of JLo added that he had trouble getting support for his famous fetes. 'They won't even give me a permit for the parties no more,' said Diddy. 'They don't want me to throw the parties no more, but we ain't gonna stop. We gonna keep on having fun bringing people together from all walks of life.' Combs felt he was helping join races together. The first White Party was held on September 7, 1998. Paris Hilton described it as 'iconic'. Photos of the gatherings are like a time capsule of late Nineties, early Noughties celebrity. Howard Stern, Kelly Osbourne, Aretha Franklin, Martha Stewart, Jay-Z and Beyonce, 'it' couple Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson. Combs, 54, was arrested last week at a New York City hotel and charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. On Wednesday Combs has been denied bail for a second time. The ex of JLo added that he had trouble getting support for his famous fetes. 'They won't even give me a permit for the parties no more,' said Diddy Combs poses with Mariah Carey at the launch party for her album The Emancipation of Mimi; she attended one of his birthday parties Ashton Kutcher co-hosted a White Party with Combs to help raise awareness for Malaria No More held at a Private Residence on July 4, 2009 in Beverly Hills The singer, center, at his The Real White Party at Club Dune on September 2, 2007 in East Hampton, New York The star is set to remain in a Brooklyn jail until he stands trial in his sex trafficking case, after a second judge refused to accept a $50million bail package offered by his lawyers. US district judge Andrew L Carter Jr dismissed Combs' request to be released to home detention with GPS monitoring, with the judge pointing out that the hip-hop mogul could potentially tamper with witnesses. Combs pleaded not guilty to allegations of sex trafficking on September 19. The rapper appeared at a court in Manhattan after being charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Asked during a court hearing how he pleaded to the charges, Combs replied: 'Not guilty.' The rapper's lawyers subsequently requested that Combs be freed on bond, pending trial, after paying a sum of $50million. However, following a a lengthy debate between legal teams on whether Combs represents a flight risk, Magistrate Judge Robyn Tarnofsky announced that the rap star will remain in detention until his sex trafficking trial begins. He also reportedly parties with Justin Bieber; seen with Sean Kingston in 2010 Marc Agnifilo - Combs' lawyer - subsequently said that the music star is determined to 'establish his innocence'. Agnifilo told reporters outside the court: 'He's going to fight this. He's innocent. He came to New York to establish his innocence. 'We believe in him wholeheartedly. He didn't do these things. There's no coercion and no crime.' Combs is 'not afraid of the charges' he's currently facing, according to his lawyer. Agnifilo added: 'He's been looking forward to this day, and he's been looking forward to clearing his name.' It was also learned last week that the Quiet On Set documentary markers are working on a series about Combs. Diddy spent time with Prince William (L), US rapper Kanye West (2nd L) and Prince Harry in 2007 in London True crime network Investigation Discovery was behind this year's documentary in which a slew of former Nickelodeon child actors alleged instances of abuse and a toxic working environment at the hands of producer Dan Schneider.

The rapper told Entertainment Tonight that he felt one day he would be arrested for his 'crazy parties.' His wild fetes - which are not to be confused with his lurid Freak Offs - were attended by stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lopez, Sarah Jessica Parker as well as Kim and Khloe Kardashian. 'You're gonna hear about my parties,' said the 54-year-old rap mogul as he referred to his star-studded bashes. 'They're gonna be shutting them down. They're gonna probably be arresting me, doing all types of crazy things just 'cause we wanna have a good time,' Combs added. There is an interview from 1999 that has come back to haunt Sean ' Diddy ' Combs. The rapper told Entertainment Tonight that he felt one day he would be arrested for his 'crazy parties.' Seen with Tommy Lee in 2007 at his Real White Party in the Hamptons Unforgivable Fragrance models pose at The Real White Party on September 2, 2007 at Combs' residence in East Hampton, New York Diddy said that he was judged by adding a 'different element' to his bashes. He argued, 'Whenever you bring up a different element into people's environment, things that broaden people's horizons, people get intimidated. It's a lot of people out there that feel intimidated by it.' Diddy has been charged with sex trafficking and related crimes and will likely spend about 10 years behind bars. The ex of JLo added that he had trouble getting support for his famous fetes. 'They won't even give me a permit for the parties no more,' said Diddy. 'They don't want me to throw the parties no more, but we ain't gonna stop. We gonna keep on having fun bringing people together from all walks of life.' Combs felt he was helping join races together. The first White Party was held on September 7, 1998. Paris Hilton described it as 'iconic'. Photos of the gatherings are like a time capsule of late Nineties, early Noughties celebrity. Howard Stern, Kelly Osbourne, Aretha Franklin, Martha Stewart, Jay-Z and Beyonce, 'it' couple Tommy Lee and Pamela Anderson. Combs, 54, was arrested last week at a New York City hotel and charged with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. On Wednesday Combs has been denied bail for a second time. The ex of JLo added that he had trouble getting support for his famous fetes. 'They won't even give me a permit for the parties no more,' said Diddy Combs poses with Mariah Carey at the launch party for her album The Emancipation of Mimi; she attended one of his birthday parties Ashton Kutcher co-hosted a White Party with Combs to help raise awareness for Malaria No More held at a Private Residence on July 4, 2009 in Beverly Hills The singer, center, at his The Real White Party at Club Dune on September 2, 2007 in East Hampton, New York The star is set to remain in a Brooklyn jail until he stands trial in his sex trafficking case, after a second judge refused to accept a $50million bail package offered by his lawyers. US district judge Andrew L Carter Jr dismissed Combs' request to be released to home detention with GPS monitoring, with the judge pointing out that the hip-hop mogul could potentially tamper with witnesses. Combs pleaded not guilty to allegations of sex trafficking on September 19. The rapper appeared at a court in Manhattan after being charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking by force, fraud, or coercion, and transportation to engage in prostitution. Asked during a court hearing how he pleaded to the charges, Combs replied: 'Not guilty.' The rapper's lawyers subsequently requested that Combs be freed on bond, pending trial, after paying a sum of $50million. However, following a a lengthy debate between legal teams on whether Combs represents a flight risk, Magistrate Judge Robyn Tarnofsky announced that the rap star will remain in detention until his sex trafficking trial begins. He also reportedly parties with Justin Bieber; seen with Sean Kingston in 2010 Marc Agnifilo - Combs' lawyer - subsequently said that the music star is determined to 'establish his innocence'. Agnifilo told reporters outside the court: 'He's going to fight this. He's innocent. He came to New York to establish his innocence. 'We believe in him wholeheartedly. He didn't do these things. There's no coercion and no crime.' Combs is 'not afraid of the charges' he's currently facing, according to his lawyer. Agnifilo added: 'He's been looking forward to this day, and he's been looking forward to clearing his name.' It was also learned last week that the Quiet On Set documentary markers are working on a series about Combs. Diddy spent time with Prince William (L), US rapper Kanye West (2nd L) and Prince Harry in 2007 in London True crime network Investigation Discovery was behind this year's documentary in which a slew of former Nickelodeon child actors alleged instances of abuse and a toxic working environment at the hands of producer Dan Schneider. Now, they have announced a multipart docuseries for 2025 which will tell 'the rise and influence of Combs and the allegations of violent behavior and illegal activity that have trailed the music mogul'. In a press release, they added: 'As accounts of sexual assault, abusive behaviors, and other disturbing claims surface, the doc traces the story of this self-proclaimed Bad Boy, unraveling allegations of a pattern of depravity.'

Visionhaus/Getty Images Rodri, who started 50 games for a title-winning Manchester City last season—interspersed with international fixtures and then helping Spain win the European Championship—is at the center of a debate about whether professional soccer stars play too many matches. He’s already publicly opined that such workloads are too much to perform at the highest level, encouraging a dialogue between the game’s decision-makers and players. And now Rodri’s minutes, over 4,000 in sky blue during 2023/24, are cut. But not in the way he wanted; it took just three seconds to send him down another less-than-ideal path against Arsenal on Sunday. Indeed, the early collision with Kai Havertz was the first blow, after which Rodri reportedly tore his anterior cruciate ligament. The dreaded injury leaves him out for most, if not the whole, campaign. Therefore, City’s title credentials will sit a sterner examination without its precious midfielder. Demonstrating his importance, the Etihad Stadium team’s unbeaten tally with him in the lineup stands at 51 games. By extension, his lengthy absence will probably determine if Rodri is the best player in the world. The 28-year-old’s intelligent positioning, assured passing, and ability to dictate the pace of games anchor everything around him. If his teammates can’t replicate the relentless consistency needed to claim titles as Rodri looks on, it will hammer home exactly how vital the Spaniard is within the Cityzens’ machine. This could be Guardiola's toughest Premier League title challenge yet.

Since his days as a youngster with Rayo Majadahonda, then Atlético Madrid and Villarreal, he’s evolved so much that City—aiming for a record-extending five consecutive first-division wins—has gone on to monopolize the competition when he plays. Then again, exactly how the squad fares minus Rodri will still be telling. Mateo Kovacic has shown his aptitude in a similar role, and coach Pep Guardiola has other options in İlkay Gündoğan and Rico Lewis, who can also manage games in the central positions. More to the point, should Guardiola continue the winning formula, the attention will be on his astute tactical mind—rather than Rodri’s skillset—driving City’s success. Nevertheless, losing one of the first names on the team list poses a challenge. A deep-lying player, Rodri is one of the favorites to win the prestigious Ballon d’Or on October 28, awarded to the man voted best in the world. Given the palmarès are usually flamboyant attackers, Rodri winning would nod towards his many attributes and measured style. The number 16 is currently in Barcelona, where he’s met the doctor Ramón Cugat—a medical expert who has supposedly treated Guardiola’s players on many occasions before and is assessing the severity of his injury.

The local police union’s pivot to Suozzi, 61, is considered a boon for the moderate — who’s faced claims of being soft on crime — in his race against Republican rival Mike LiPetri, 34, for the competitive Long Island-Queens District 3 seat. “Tom [Suozzi] is a man of his word. He is willing to fight against his own party,” Nassau PBA president Tom Shevlin said in a press briefing. “Tom is a proven leader. He has proven to us that he will represent us and his district very well.” Local law enforcement unions have sided mostly with Republican candidates since Albany Democrats approved bail reform in 2019 — the controversial law that nixed cashless bail for many crimes. The Nassau PBA has already endorsed former President Donald Trump. “This is a big deal,” Suozzi said of the endorsement. “I will always support the cops. … We have to fund the police.” Suozzi slammed calls to “defund” the police as “the most wrong-headed, stupidest idea I ever heard.” In February, the Nassau police union backed GOP candidate Mazi Pilip over Suozzi in a special election following George Santos’ expulsion from Congress — a race Suozzi easily won. The former Nassau County executive served three terms in the House but didn’t seek re-election in 2022, instead losing handily in a Democratic primary for governor to Kathy Hochul. The LiPetri campaign brushed off the endorsement. “Let’s not be fooled, Tom Suozzi is no friend of law enforcement — he voted to eliminate qualified immunity, he kicked ICE out of Nassau County, and he’s best friends with pro-crime Democrats like Kamala Harris, Tim Walz, and Kathy Hochul,” said Mike Falk, LiPetri’s campaign manager. “Police Officers and law enforcement families know who really backs the blue and who only shows up when it’s election time.” Republicans believe LiPetri, a former member of the statehouse, has a shot at toppling the incumbent. The National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Republicans to the House, last week added LiPetri to its “Young Guns” program — indicating the seat will be a priority.","summary":"The Nassau County PBA endorsed Democratic Rep.

The cutting-edge technology is making it easier for Russia as well as Iran to quickly and more convincingly tailor often-polarizing content aimed at swaying American voters, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told reporters at a briefing. “The [intelligence community] considers AI a malign influence accelerant, not yet a revolutionary influence tool,” the official said. “In other words, information operations are the threat, and AI is an enabler.” Intelligence officials have previously said they saw AI used in elections overseas. “Our update today makes clear that this is now happening here,” the ODNI official said. Russian influence operations have spread synthetic images, video, audio, and text online, officials said. That includes AI-generated content “of and about prominent U.S. figures” and material seeking to emphasize divisive issues such as immigration. Officials said that’s consistent with the Kremlin’s broader goal to boost former President Donald Trump and denigrate Vice President Kamala Harris. But Russia is also using lower-tech methods. The ODNI official said Russian influence actors staged a video in which a woman claimed to be a victim of a hit-and-run by Harris in 2011. There’s no evidence that ever happened. Last week, Microsoft also said Russia was behind the video, which was spread by a website claiming to be a nonexistent local San Francisco TV station. Russia is also behind manipulated videos of Harris’s speeches, the ODNI official said. They may have been altered using editing tools or with AI. They were disseminated on social media and using other methods. “One of the efforts we see Russian influence actors do is, when they create this media, try to encourage its spread,” the ODNI official said. The official said the videos of Harris had been altered in a range of ways, to “paint her in a bad light both personally but also in comparison to her opponent” and to focus on issues Russia believes are divisive. Iran has also tapped AI to generate social media posts and write fake stories for websites posing as legitimate news outlets, officials said. The intelligence community has said Iran is seeking to undercut Trump in the 2024 election. Iran has used AI to create such content in both English and Spanish, and is targeting Americans “across the political spectrum on polarizing issues” including the war in Gaza and the presidential candidates, officials said. China, the third main foreign threat to U.S. elections, is using AI in its broader influence operations that aim to shape global views of China and amplify divisive topics in the U.S. such as drug use, immigration, and abortion, officials said.","summary":"The cutting-edge technology makes it easier for Russia as well as Iran to quickly and more convincingly tailor polarizing content aimed at swaying American voters, intelligence officials said.","url":"https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123927/russia-artificial-intelligence-election","image":"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4660x3240+0+0/resize/4660x3240!/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc3%2F17%2Fd87ab83a407db3f163e6ff424dfb%2Fgettyimages-2173180626.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:01:37","author":"Shannon Bond","authors":["Shannon Bond"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.057},{"id":257159450,"title":"Apple And CEO Tim Cook’s Pivot To Wellness Is A Wake Up Call To CEOs","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Much like Apple seems to be strategically pivoting, CEOs must do the same.

Instead of unveiling a \"wow\" factor, Apple leaned into health-focused features like sleep apnea notifications, AirPods functioning as hearing aids, and a new Apple Watch app tracking overnight biometrics. As shared in Sherwood, \"A brand that once felt young and hip seemed to be acting its age, trading in super sexy styles for features that seemed to be genuinely useful for a user base that is getting older. Apple's preoccupation with style seems to have given way to a focus on durability and substance.\" While this may have felt like a letdown to some, it's a smart and strategic move by Apple and Tim Cook. They're embracing two critical lessons that CEOs and organizational leaders can also use to stay at the top of their industry, build high-performing teams, and retain top talent: Meet People Where They Are At first glance, Apple's shift in focus might seem like a disconnect from its innovative roots. However, what Apple is actually doing is keeping its core customers in mind. Nearly 50 years after its founding, Apple's customer base has aged, and its priorities have shifted. Products like the iPhone have been around for almost two decades. The world and the people using these devices are in a different place now than in 2007. Apple is adapting to this reality by offering practical wellness features that resonate with its aging audience. As a result, it's staying connected to its core consumers by anticipating what matters most to them at this stage of life. Similarly, today's workplace is evolving at a rapid pace. Millennials comprise the largest labor force segment, with Gen Z close behind. Understanding these evolving dynamics is an untapped competitive advantage for organizations seeking to retain talent and get the best from their people. It's not about surface-level perks. But instead, it's about tailoring initiatives that comprehensively address employee well-being. CEOs should ask themselves, \"Are we growing and adapting to stay connected with our people?\" This question can help close the gap between good and great performance in a competitive marketplace.

With that said, it's abundantly clear that Apple is doubling down on brand loyalty through an ecosystem lock-in and positioning itself for the future. AI adoption is on the rise, and Apple is integrating AI with health and wellness to meet the interests of its core base of people while making everyday life more efficient for them. AI is still in its early stages of adoption in organizations, but moving quickly on this front could provide a strategic advantage, especially with workplace wellness and talent optimization. According to a Microsoft study, 54% of early-career employees say that access to AI would influence their choice of employer. Additionally, a Gartner CEO and Senior Business Executive Survey reports that 87% of CEOs are optimistic about AI's workplace impact. For leaders, the next step is clear: start implementing AI to meet people further where they are and create a more dynamic, productive, efficient, and engaged workplace. Just as Apple continues to read the room and evolve with the times, CEOs and organizational leaders can apply these same principles to thrive—not just survive—in today's competitive business landscape.

Zelensky, 46, further blasted the blueprint Vance, 40, outlined to end the war in Ukraine, characterizing it as a push for Kyiv ” to give up our territories.” “He is too radical,” Zelensky said of Trump’s running mate pick during a lengthy interview with The New Yorker published Sunday. “[Vance’s] message seems to be that Ukraine must make a sacrifice. This brings us back to the question of the cost and who shoulders it. The idea that the world should end this war at Ukraine’s expense is unacceptable.” Vance had long been a skeptic of US military assistance to the besieged ally, contending the US lacks the necessary resources to help Ukraine compete in a munitions-intensive protracted war against Russia, particularly while Israel is still battling Hamas. Earlier this month, Vance outlined a blueprint to end the war during a radio interview — a plan that entailed the establishment of a special demilitarized zone between the two warring nations. “It doesn’t join NATO, it doesn’t join some of these sort of allied institutions,” Vance further explained on “The Shawn Ryan Show.” “I think that’s ultimately what this looks like.” That plan sparked outrage in Ukraine. Trump, 78, himself, has crowed about how he would end the bloody war within 24 hours but has been very short on specifics. Trump spoke with Zelensky in July. ‘Hasn’t been like this with Trump’ “For us, these are dangerous signals, coming as they do from a potential Vice-President. I should say that it hasn’t been like this with Trump. He and I talked on the phone, and his message was as positive as it could be, from my point of view. ‘I understand,’ ‘I will lend support,’ and so on,” Zelensky told the outlet. “I don’t take Vance’s words seriously,” he added. Zelensky argued that if Vance’s policy were to go into effect, “then America is headed for global conflict,” because it would send a message to adversarial nations an “implicit rule: I came, I conquered, now this is mine.” The Ukrainian president further invoked the lessons of World War II and the history of appeasement on the world’s stage. Earlier this month, Trump sidestepped a question during his debate against Vice President Kamala Harris about whether or not he wants Ukraine to prevail in the deadly war against Russian invaders. “Trump makes political statements in his election campaign. He says he wants the war to stop. Well, we do, too,” Zelensky reflected, shrugging off Trump’s remarks. Zelensky is slated to meet with President Biden this week at the White House as he travels to the US to address the United Nations General Assembly during its 79th session in midtown Manhattan. He toured an ammunition manufacturing plant in Pennsylvania on Sunday. During his visit to the US, which marks his fifth such trip since Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, Zelensky “plans to meet with Vice President Kamala Harris, representatives of the U.S. Congress from both parties, and the 45th President of the United States, Donald Trump,” according to his office. It is unclear when a potential meeting with Trump will take place. The Post has contacted the Trump campaign for comment. “I think Ukraine has demonstrated the wisdom of not becoming captured by American domestic politics. We have always tried to avoid influencing the choices of the American people—that would simply be wrong,” Zelesnky said. Plan for Victory Underpinning Zelensky’s discussions with Biden in particular will be an unveiling of a so-called plan for victory. Ukraine’s delegation has been working to counter China’s peace plan to contain the battlefield and bring about dialogue between the two warring countries. Instead, Zelensky wants a total victory that would usher in a return to its 1991 borders, which would mean getting Russian-annexed Crimea back in its hands as well as regaining control of the Donbas region. “Victory is about justice,” Zelensky stressed to the New Yorker. “[Russian leader Vladimir] Putin has zero desire to end the war on any reasonable terms at all.” “The victory plan is a plan that swiftly strengthens Ukraine. A strong Ukraine will force Putin to the negotiating table. I’m convinced of that.” Zelensky was tight-lipped about potential strategies in his plan for victory, but sent strong signals that it would involve significant support from Ukraine’s allies — concerning weaponry and the economy. He also sought to entice the US to loosen restrictions on long-range weapons. That comes weeks after Ukraine embarked on its stunning incursion into Kursk, a city in western Russia that seemingly caught Moscow by surprise. “It was clear to us that Russia is pressing us in the east,” Zelensky explained about the military operation. “It has already shown some results. It has slowed down the Russians and forced them to move some of their forces to Kursk.”","summary":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky publicly bashed GOP vice presidential hopeful JD Vance as being \"too radical,\" ahead of a potential meeting with former President Donald Trump.","url":"https://nypost.com/2024/09/23/us-news/volodymyr-zelensky-calls-jd-vance-too-radical-ahead-of-potential-meeting-with-trump/","image":"https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/09/ukrainian-president-volodymyr-zelensky-speaks-90275035.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200","video":"https://cdn.jwplayer.com/videos/xWpaX5xs-RyIcpnTz.mp4","publish_date":"2024-09-23 23:00:09","author":"Ryan King","authors":["Ryan King"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"us","sentiment":-0.302},{"id":257159452,"title":"Trump Slams Senator Who Prevented Nebraska Changing Its Electoral Voting System","text":"Share to Facebook Share to Twitter Share to Linkedin Topline Former President Donald Trump slammed Nebraska Republican Sen. Mike McDonnell after the state senator said he would not support a change to the way the state allocates its Electoral College votes that would likely increase Trump’s chances of winning the presidential election in November. Former President Donald Trump arrives for a rally at the I-80 Speedway on May 01, 2022 in Greenwood, ... [+] Nebraska. Getty Images Key Facts Trump said in a post on Truth Social on Monday afternoon that McDonnell is a “Grandstander!” who “decided, for no reason whatsoever, to get in the way of a great Republican, common sense, victory.” The criticism from the former president came hours after McDonnell reiterated he would not support a change to the way the state—which is just one of two that doesn’t use a winner-takes-all approach—allocates its electoral votes, saying he was concerned about the timing of the change and it reducing Nebraska’s national significance. Nebraska Republicans sought to change the current system, which awards two electoral votes to the winner of the state and three to the winner of the three House districts, one of which covers the Omaha area, in order to increase the chances that Trump takes all of the state's five electoral votes. “After deep consideration, it is clear to me that right now, 43 days from Election Day, is not the moment to make this change,” McDonnell, a Democrat-turned-Republican, said in a statement reiterating his stance against a winner-take-all model, the Omaha World-Herald reported.

Why Did Republicans Want To Change The Allocation System? If McDonnell had changed his mind and backed a winner-take-all allocation of the state’s votes, Trump likely would have secured the Electoral College vote representing a House district inclusive of Omaha, which Vice President Kamala Harris is favored to win under the current allocation system. If Trump took that vote, won the Sun Belt swing states and Harris held the “blue wall” of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, there could have been a situation in which they tied with 269 electoral votes—sending the decision to the GOP-controlled House, which would likely select Trump as president. Key Background McDonnell had said in the past he didn’t support the change to a winner-take-all system, but The New York Times reported he was considering arguments for why changes should be made last week amid a renewed push for the change from lawmakers. The push came as the race between Harris and Trump is expected to be extremely close in November: As of Monday, Harris led Trump by just 2.8 points on average in polling, according to FiveThirtyEight. Both campaigns are focusing heavily on seven swing states—Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin—that could sway the election. Tangent Trump also thanked Republican Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen “for trying to help” pass the change—saying it “would have been better, and far less expensive, for everyone!”—and Omaha Republican Mayor Jean Stothert, who has voiced support for a winner-take-all allocation.

And, in doing so, they were critical of Russia's ongoing war with its independent eastern neighbor, according to new reports. In their 5th meeting, the G7+ Ministerial Group met amid the 79th United Nations General Assembly session that is ongoing in New York City. At that meeting, the group members reaffirmed \"our unwavering support for Ukraine in the face of Russia's brutal and unjust attacks on Ukraine and its energy infrastructure,\" a joint release by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani and Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha stated. Blinken said earlier Monday that the G7 and partner nations have collectively \"worked to mobilize resources over the last couple of years for Ukraine, for its people, to ensure that they have the energy supplies that they need and that the country can deliver those supplies to the people who need them.\" \"We reaffirm our strong commitment to the territorial integrity, independence, and sovereignty of Ukraine within its internationally recognized borders and to focus on the key priorities needed to achieve a comprehensive, just, and lasting peace based on international law, including the U.N. Charter and its principles,\" the statement said. They also pledged to provide further funding and other support to address the Ukrainian energy sector's most urgent needs, which they said includes repairs of damaged power plants and district heating systems, deployment of new, distributed power generation and emergency backup power for critical services, and the \"passive protection\" for its energy infrastructure. Recently, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen pledged more than $39 billion in loans for Ukraine to help repair power plants and critical civilian infrastructure as it continues to fight against Russia's invasion. In their statement, Blinken, Tajani and Sybiha called out Russia's seizure and continued control of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. \"We emphasize that any use of nuclear energy and nuclear installations must be safe, secured, safe-guarded, and environmentally sound,\" they said, stressing that the nuclear facility \"must return to the full sovereign control of Ukraine in line with IAEA principles and under its independent supervision.\" On Monday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was in the United States to lobby lawmakers to aid Ukraine's war efforts and laid out a \"plan for victory\" to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee. Speaking Sunday on a visit to a munitions plant in Scranton, Pa., producing 155mm artillery shells for Ukraine, Zelensky said the plan took into consideration the contingency of the November U.S. presidential election and an imminent new occupant in the White House. \"The plan includes not only what is needed from Biden today. There will be a new president in the United States and we need to talk to each of the candidates,\" he said. The United States, Italy, as well as Ukraine, \"strongly condemned,\" their statement said, Russia's \"continuous missile and drone strikes\" on Ukraine's energy infrastructure and cities, which -- according to the diplomats in their release -- had escalated since March and \"severely threaten Ukraine's energy security.\" Also threatened, they said, is Ukrainian civilian access \"to critical services including electricity, heat, and water during the cold winter months, which could be the harshest for Ukraine since at least its independence.\" In February, Italy signed an agreement in Munich with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development -- or EBRD, the more than 30-year-old international financial institution -- for a more than $222 million Euro project \"to restore the capacity of the main hydropower generation Ukraine company,\" Tajani said Monday in brief remarks. And the Italian government had authorized a previous $55 million grant for \"urgent measures\" needed to repair Ukraine's energy infrastructures in its ongoing war. Italy, Tajani said in his own remarks, has been \"strongly engaged on this on the bilateral level since the start of the war.\" The joint statement also pointed to regional energy implications of the Russian military's ongoing military incursion in the former Soviet satellite state, such as on the neighboring small country of Moldova. \"The arrival of the winter is imminent, and we are very concerned by this situation,\" Italy's foreign minister said. The three alliances nations \"welcome and underscore,\" they said, \"the significance of Ukraine's commitment to business-enabling reforms that will establish a level playing field for investment in the energy sector\" while calling on international partners \"to elevate their financial contributions\" to Ukraine. They also acknowledged the need for international assistance to protect Ukraine's energy infrastructure from future attacks, which the statement says include strengthening the Ukrainian air defense capabilities, and reaffirm its readiness to continue providing such assistance. Supporting the Ukrainian vision of a \"more decentralized, diversified, resilient, and renewable/sustainable energy system\" that is fully integrated with Europe is the goal. \"We are convinced that rebuilding Ukraine's energy system in the short and long term is in the interest of enhancing global energy security and sustainability.\"","summary":"On top of the ongoing U.N.

The bombastic former US president was unusually restrained at an event about China’s influence on the US economy, a round table at which farmers and manufacturers expressed concerns about losing their way of life. Behind Trump were large green tractors and a sign declaring “Protect our food from China”. The event in Smithton, Pennsylvania, gave Trump a chance to drive his economic message against Vice-President Kamala Harris, arguing that imposing tariffs and boosting energy production will lower costs. He highlighted Harris’ reversal of a previous vow to ban fracking, a method of producing natural gas key to Pennsylvania’s economy. And he noted the tractors behind him were manufactured by John Deere, which announced in June it was moving skid steer and track loader manufacturing to Mexico and working to acquire land there for a new factory. Trump threatened the firm with a 200 per cent tariff should he win back the presidency and it opted to export manufacturing to Mexico. “If they want to build in the United States, there’s no tariff,” he added. In response to an participant’s concerns about energy production, Trump said he did not know that farmers were so energy-dependent. Another farmer talked about Chinese-subsidised businesses, prompting Trump to respond: “That’s why we need tariffs.” When the same farmer finished her comments by praising him profusely, he said: “Amen. I agree.” Trump has embraced tariffs as he tries to appeal to working-class voters who oppose free-trade deals and the outsourcing of factories and jobs, and the event was not all about showing a more personable side. Later the former president took questions from reporters and got more customarily combative when asked whether he was concerned that tariffs on manufacturers such as John Deere would increase costs for farmers. He said of Harris: “She is not going to be good for Pennsylvania.” China is getting into our farmlands, and we have to be able to see China very clearly Lee Zeldin, New York congressman Trump was holding a rally later in the day in Indiana, Pennsylvania, where he is hoping conservative, white working-class voters help him pull ahead of Harris, who herself is visiting Pennsylvania on Wednesday. “Despite all his lies and pandering, Donald Trump used the White House to give handouts to wealthy corporations and foreign companies at the expense of family farmers, drive farm bankruptcies to record levels, and sacrifice small American farmers as pawns in his failed trade war with China,” Harris campaign spokesman Joseph Costello said in a statement. Monday’s farming event was hosted by the Protecting America Initiative, led by Richard Grenell, Trump’s former acting director of national intelligence, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin. Grenell said: “China is getting into our farmlands, and we have to be able to see China very clearly.” At the end of 2022, China held nearly 250,000 acres of US land, which is slightly less than 1 per cent of foreign-held acres, according to the US Department of Agriculture. By comparison, Canada was the largest foreign owner of US land, accounting for 32 per cent, or 14.2 million acres. Still, the National Agricultural Law Centre estimates that 24 states ban or limit foreigners without residency and foreign businesses or governments from owning private farmland. The issue emerged after a Chinese billionaire bought more than 130,000 acres near a US Air Force base in Texas and another Chinese company sought to build a corn plant near an Air Force base in North Dakota. Rex Murphy, from a nearby rural community who raises cattle and grows corn and hay, said farmers support Trump in this area, and said he wanted fewer taxes and “more freedom”. “I want him to do everything for the economy,” said Murphy, 48. “If he just becomes president, and he does what he does, he will do more.”","summary":"Trump’s backdrop at Pennsylvania event was sign reading ‘Protect our food from China’ as farmers expressed concerns about losing way of life.","url":"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3279676/trump-listens-mostly-quiet-event-about-chinas-influence-us-economy","image":"https://cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2024/09/24/d45ad3d4-23f0-496d-a7b5-2c6a5de716f7_48631ae7.jpg","video":null,"publish_date":"2024-09-23 22:46:20","author":"Reuters","authors":["Reuters"],"language":"en","catgory":"politics","source_country":"cn","sentiment":0.041}]}
